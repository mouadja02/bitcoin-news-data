2025-07-09T14:51:07,"Solana at critical decision point: will SOL breakout to $176 or tumble to $131?","Solana is testing a highly technical resistance zone. A breakout could trigger a move toward $176, while a rejection risks a return to the $131 support level. Volume confirmation remains the deciding factor. Solana’s ( SOL ) price action is approaching a critical inflection point. After reclaiming the point of control within its current trading range, the asset is now challenging a dense resistance cluster. The outcome at this level, whether a breakout or a rejection, will likely determine the next major move. A breakout could initiate a bullish expansion toward the $176 region, while failure to overcome this confluence zone would suggest continued range-bound behavior between $154 and $131. Key technical points Reclaimed Point of Control: Price action has returned above the volume-weighted average zone. Stacked Resistance at $154: Includes the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement and anchored VWAP from highs. Volume Still Lacking: Breakout must be supported by volume or risks invalidation. SOLUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView Solana recently rebounded from a key swing low just below $130, triggering a strong upward move that peaked at $187. Since then, the price has been confined within a defined range, oscillating between the value area high near $154 and the value area low around $131. Reclaiming the point of control signaled renewed interest from buyers, but the current rally is encountering significant headwinds. Price is now testing a technically dense resistance region marked by two major confluences: the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement from the previous swing high and the anchored VWAP drawn from the top of the range. This dual-layered resistance makes the area structurally significant, and difficult to break without strong momentum. You might also like: DNSBTC celebrates 2m users with free BTC, LTC cloud mining contracts If Solana fails to reclaim this resistance zone on a closing candle basis, a move back toward the $131 support level is likely. This would keep price locked within the broader range and reinforce the rotational structure of the current market. However, if resistance is broken decisively, and most importantly, with supporting volume, the probability of a bullish expansion increases significantly. The next target would be the $176 region, aligning with a prior swing high and high time frame resistance. A key variable to watch here is volume. The current push higher has occurred with declining participation, raising the risk of a false breakout. If demand fails to materialize near the highs, price is likely to rotate lower once again. What to expect in the coming price action Solana is at a technical crossroads. A breakout above $154, backed by volume, opens the path to $176. Failure to reclaim this zone increases the likelihood of a rotation back to the $131 support area.

2025-07-09T14:48:34,"Elon Musk’s Viral Meme Sends $PNUT Soaring – What it Means for the Best Meme Coins in 2025","Tech billionaire, space adventurer, and aspiring President of the World, Elon Musk, has sent a meme coin soaring with just one post on his self-owned X platform. And as $PNUT sees a 153.9% spike in trading volume since yesterday, the market’s best meme coins in 2025 could go along for the ride. Just how Musk sent $PNUT on an unintentional Tesla ride to the moon came about because of his take on the Epstein files. Go figure. Proving that there’s never a dull moment when it comes to the US, the FBI and Department of Justice issued a statement on its review of the Jeffrey Epstein files. On a highly contentious note, however, the departments collectively state that they found no evidence of a client list. That, of course, is somewhat of a surprise to most, considering the many high-profile individuals – among them US President Donald Trump – who had reportedly been associated with Epstein over many years, before his suicide in 2019 while incarcerated. And who could forget the cringy yet popcorn-worthy war of social media posts between Musk and Donald Trump, following the very public breakup of their bromance. At the time, the former head honcho of DOGE went as far as to allege that the President was mentioned in the Epstein files. That specific post was subsequently deleted. But now that the DOJ and FBI have denied any evidence of a client list in the Epstein files, Musk has hit back with another post. This time, it’s a meme that refers to social media squirrel star Peanut and his raccoon sidekick Fred, who met their untimely demise through euthanasia at the hands of state authorities. Musk Tweets, $PNUT Pumps Of course, his X post is a jab at the US administration, pointing towards a cover-up. However, Musk’s mere mention of the dearly departed squirrel saw its eponymous meme coin – Peanut the Squirrel ($PNUT) – soar by 10% within a few short hours. $PNUT reached $0.2379, although it has since settled. At the time of writing, 1 $PNUT costs $0.2250. That’s still a 5.42% increase, however. And with a 24-hour trading volume of $259.26M $PNUT’s market cap is also up by 4.5%, at $222.58M. One thing is clear. While meme coins were once dismissed as having no place among the OGs of the market, since 2024, the top meme coins have claimed their place as heavy hitters. More Meme Coins Set to Explode? It’s not only the likes of $DOGE, $SHIB, $PEPE, and $BONK taking the limelight. As $PNUT is also enjoying its time in the sun (thanks, Elon). And with a little viral nudge, more of the best meme coins of 2025 , like the ones we’ve reviewed below, have the potential to prove their mettle. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – An L2 Set to Revolutionize the Bitcoin Blockchain Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the exciting new meme coin behind a Layer-2 Bitcoin ecosystem, designed to add much scalability to the platform. That’s big news because, while the Bitcoin blockchain is renowned for its security, it has some pitfalls. For one, transactions are often pricey and, at the best of times, pretty slow compared to the Solana counterpart. Cross-chain compatibility is also a bugbear. But that’s where Bitcoin Hyper steps in. It’ll enable fast, low-fee Bitcoin transactions. And, being a multi-chain platform, it’ll open the Bitcoin door to meme coins, DeFi, and dApps. That in itself is a biggie. $HYPER is currently in presale, which means you can buy it for just $0.0122 and stake it for an impressive 372% in rewards. Our guide to buying $HYPER explains how to do just that. Remember, though, $HYPER’s price will increase in stages. So the clock is ticking on this one. 2. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – The Telegram Bot for Instant, Easy Trading Trading bots are becoming more and more en vogue as the crypto market attracts new investors and traders. The Snorter Bot, however, has a competitive edge – it’s native to Telegram. And powered by its native token, Snorter ($SNORT) , this could be a game-changer. That’s because the trading bot offers a fast, low-fee trading suite. That means $SNORT holders can automate swaps, execute copy trades, track their portfolios, set up stop-losses, and much more – directly from within their Telegram chat. Whether you’re a degen or crypto newbie, the Snorter Bot pulls out all the stops to make investing and trading a cinch. And all the while employing high-grade rugpull and honeypot detection to keep you – and your crypto – safe from scams and fraud. To explore what else this powerful little trading bot can do if you’re a $SNORT holder, take a look at our guide to buying Snorter Token . Like $HYPER, $SNORT is also in presale. It currently costs $0.0977, and you can stake yours for 220% APY. 3. America Party ($AP) – Trending on the Back of US Politics In keeping with all things Elon and meme coins, the America Party Token ($AP) could be another one to watch. And its name is inspired by – you guessed it right – Musk’s new political party, which he announced he was launching in a July 5 X post . To be clear, though, this meme coin is not Musk’s own pet project. But, according to the official $AP website, it is “inspired by the outspoken clarity of figures like Elon Musk, who champions truth over perception and action over rhetoric.” That also makes the America Party meme coin very much a newcomer to the market. However, it has already been listed on DEXs and is available for trading. While the future of $AP and indeed, Musk’s own political party, remains unclear, it’ll be interesting to see how this meme coin performs down the line. Especially considering that meme coins linked to – or mentioned by – Musk tend to get noticed. Currently, $AP costs $0.002201 , up 7979% since its launch less than two days ago. The Space to Watch When America sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold, as they say. But if that results in Musk bolstering the meme coin market – albeit inadvertently – it’s a cold we don’t mind catching. Just ask $PNUT. It’s surely not complaining. The rest of the meme coin market also stands to gain. That’s why we expect big things from top meme coins like $HYPER . As always, though, be sure to DYOR before making any investment. This, after all, is not financial advice, and the crypto market is unpredictable.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/best-meme-coins-soar-after-musk-viral-boost-to-pnut/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Crypto News",cryptocompare

The company announced that its short-term objective is to acquire 3,000 BTC , although this target may be adjusted based on Bitcoin’s market price and Remixpoint’s stock performance (3825.T). In a July 9 statement translated from Japanese, Remixpoint explained, “ We have become even more convinced of Bitcoin’s future, and this decision is the result of extensive discussions to enhance corporate value from a risk-return perspective, while also keeping future options open. “ リミックスポイント本日開示 ファイナンスにて約315億円資金調達 資金使途、全額BTC取得 目先『3000BTC保有』を目指す ※BTC価格、株価により変動あり （初回以降は3日連続取引日の平均株価） 背景 より一層ビットコインの未来に確信を 持ち、議論を重ねた結果となります。… — リミックスポイント公式Xアカウント (@remixpoint_x) July 9, 2025 Japanese Remixpoint Building on Existing Bitcoin Strategy Remixpoint has been accumulating Bitcoin since September 2024, establishing itself as a significant corporate holder in the cryptocurrency space. According to Bitcoin treasuries data, Remixpoint ranks as the 30th publicly listed company by Bitcoin holdings with 1,051 BTC, surpassing firms like Nano Labs and The Smarter Web Company at the time of writing. The company’s commitment to Bitcoin was demonstrated earlier this year when it approved a ¥1 billion ($7 million) Bitcoin purchase following a board resolution in May. Japan’s Remixpoint approves another $7M Bitcoin purchase, raising total crypto holdings to $84M. #Japan #Remixpoint #Bitcoin https://t.co/ozpqS3v3QL — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 26, 2025 Beyond Bitcoin, Remixpoint has expanded its digital asset holdings to include Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), and Avalanche ( AVAX ). In September 2024, the firm invested approximately $351,700 to acquire 130.1 ETH , 2,260.5 SOL, and 12,269.9 AVAX tokens. The Japanese firm’s crypto commitment extends to executive compensation, with the company becoming the first Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed entity to pay its CEO and President entirely in Bitcoin. According to the report, CEO Yoshihiko Takahashi characterized this decision as a “ clear signal ” of his commitment to corporate value and shareholder-focused governance. Moreover, Remixpoint’s stock price has demonstrated a strong correlation with Bitcoin’s performance, benefiting from the cryptocurrency’s success. When Bitcoin reached its lows of $77,000 in April, 3825.T shares traded at ¥328 ($2.26). As Bitcoin climbed above $109,000 in May, the stock price more than doubled to ¥701 ($4.88). Source: Bitcoin Treasuries At press time, Remixpoint shares trade at 592 yen, reflecting a 3.86% increase in the last 24 hours and over 64% year-to-date gains, according to Google Finance . Growing Japanese Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Remixpoint’s strategy aligns with an emerging trend among publicly listed companies that incorporate Bitcoin into their balance sheets. While U.S.-based companies like MicroStrategy have popularized this approach , Remixpoint joins a growing list of Japanese firms adopting similar models. Metaplanet, another Bitcoin-focused Japanese company, has consistently expanded its holdings of BTC. Japanese investment firm @Metaplanet_JP has unveiled an ambitious new target to amass 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. #Metaplanet #Bitcoin https://t.co/jCQ3G0uzPC — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 6, 2025 On Monday, Metaplanet purchased an additional 2,205 BTC , bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to 15,555 BTC, valued at approximately 225.8 billion yen ($1.7 billion). In April, NASDAQ-listed Japanese beauty and cosmetic surgery clinic operator SBC Medical Group Holdings completed a Bitcoin purchase worth over $418,000 . Moreover, Japan’s evolving regulatory landscape is supporting the increased adoption of cryptocurrencies. The country is preparing to formally recognize crypto assets as financial products under its Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and is moving toward approving Bitcoin ETFs. These developments are expected to encourage more Japanese companies and citizens to embrace Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investments. Government officials are also considering Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Satoshi Hamada, a member of parliament from the Party to Protect the People from NHK, has called for the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve , similar to recent proposals from lawmakers in Argentina, Russia, and other countries.

2025-07-09T14:39:18,"Cantor Equity Partners: Waiting On Merger With Twenty One Capital","Summary Cantor Equity Partners is merging with Twenty One Holdings to create a Bitcoin-focused entity, measuring performance in Bitcoin terms. Twenty One will introduce Bitcoin Per Share and Bitcoin Return Rate as new performance metrics for shareholders. Current share conversion ratios for Cantor Equity Partners are examined to determine if CEP represents an opportunity. Cantor Equity Partners ( CEP ) announced a reverse merger on April 22, 2025, which will merge into a new entity, Twenty One Capital Inc. Cantor Equity Partners was incorporated in 2020 under a different name, and in June 2024, the company changed its name and prepared for its IPO in August 2024. Currently, if an investor wants to invest before the merger becomes official, they must purchase Cantor Equity Partners' shares. The purpose of this article will be to examine shares of Cantor Equity Partners to determine the opportunity at hand in the case that the merger is completed. Investors Several interesting parties have come together to spearhead this merger. This impressive list of investors will be major voices in determining the direction of the company. Bitfinex Bitfinex is a cryptocurrency exchange headquartered in the British Virgin Islands and is contributing 7,000 bitcoins to the merger. Given their expertise in Bitcoin exchange operations, they could be a valuable partner to the company. Bitfinex will be one of the largest shareholders, along with those mentioned below. Softbank Group Softbank, headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, is a major investor in the new company and is contributing approximately $900 million in capital. They are projected to hold 26.1% of shares when the merger is completed. Tether Tether, the largest USD stablecoin issuer, will be the majority shareholder in the company. There is a gray area surrounding how much ownership will be given to these major shareholders, but Tether is expected to hold nearly 50 percent of the equity and greater than 50 percent of the voting power. The following table shows a breakdown of what ownership will look like before and after the conversion of some convertible notes offered in the deal. This graphic was sourced from an article on CoinDesk describing the merger. Pre and Post Convert Twenty One Shares (Twenty One Capital Presentation ) Management & Friends CEO Jack Mallers Well-known Bitcoin investor and entrepreneur Jack Mallers will lead the company while also leading his current company, Strike. Strike is a Bitcoin company that offers various Bitcoin-related services. Here is a statement from Jack Mallers on what he hopes Twenty One Capital will become. We believe that Bitcoin is the answer, and Twenty One is how we bring that answer to public markets. Our mission is simple: to become the most successful company in Bitcoin, the most valuable financial opportunity of our time. We’re not here to beat the market, we’re here to build a new one. A public stock, built by Bitcoiners, for Bitcoiners. Friends in High Places Howard Lutnick formerly served as the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, where he reportedly invested over $1 billion into Strategy, the original Bitcoin treasury company. This was prior to Lutnick stepping down as CEO to serve as the Secretary of Commerce inside the Trump administration. With Lutnick no longer the CEO, his son Brandon Lutnick now leads Cantor Fitzgerald. This is another key relationship for the company that will potentially give it unique access to capital markets. Creating Value Twenty One, headquartered in New York City, will be concentrated on creating value in Bitcoin terms. It remains to be seen what their exact strategy will be, but we know they will be measuring their company's performance in Bitcoin. Will they implement a strategy similar to the company now known as Strategy...formerly MicroStrategy (Strategy) ( MSTR )? Here is a quote from Cantor's press release . As part of its launch, Twenty One will introduce two key performance metrics, to reflect its Bitcoin-denominated capital structure and Bitcoin-focused mindset. Bitcoin Per Share ((BPS)): Amount of Bitcoin each fully-diluted share represents, reflecting shareholder ownership in Bitcoin rather than fiat earnings per share. Bitcoin Return Rate (BRR): Rate at which BPS grows over time, denominating the company’s performance in Bitcoin. Bitcoin Treasury Companies and Market Net Asset Value (MNAV) Currently, Bitcoin treasury companies are often valued in terms of their market net asset value, or MNAV, which is a measure of the market value of the Bitcoin they own, less any debt on the balance sheet. Strategy Since Twenty One will be a Bitcoin treasury company, much like Strategy currently is, it is appropriate to measure them in relation to the amount of Bitcoin they will hold when the merger is completed, as well as relative to how Strategy is being valued. As of Strategy's latest press release , the company owns 580,250 bitcoin. As of 7/8/2025, Bitcoin is valued at $109,000, giving Strategy an asset value of over $68 billion. Strategy's total debt is $10.4 billion as of their March 2025 financial report, leaving them with an MNAV of about $57.6 billion. Their current market cap is $112 billion, giving them an MNAV of just below two. Twenty One Capital and Its Bitcoin Holdings Twenty One Holdings expects the company to hold around 42,000 bitcoins post-merger, which would make it the second largest Bitcoin treasury company behind Strategy and the third public company Bitcoin treasury behind Strategy and MARA Holdings ( MARA ). With Bitcoin's price at $109,000, it places the market value of their Bitcoin at around $4.6 billion. Cantor Equity Partners Conversion Ratio The proposed merger is a reverse merger where the Cantor Equity Partners shares will convert into shares of Twenty One Holdings with the ticker symbol XXI. Public SPAC holders of Cantor Equity Partners are expected to hold 2.7 percent of the company after the merger is finalized. The company is expected to hold somewhere in the range of 42,000 bitcoins, meaning the market value of its Bitcoin at today's price is (42,000 x $109,000) about $4.6 billion. Now, if we apply a similar MNAV to Cantor Equity Partners as Strategy currently has, that equals a projected market capitalization of $9.2 billion, assuming the company has no debt. Cantor Equity Partners currently has 10 million Class A shares outstanding and a couple of million Class B shares as well, but it's unclear how all of that will convert to shares of Twenty One. For simplicity's sake, I'm going to assume there are around 10 million shares, and those will convert 1 to 1 into XXI shares, as we saw in the table graphic above. There are expected to be 371 million shares outstanding in the new entity, Twenty One Capital. Of the SPAC equity owners, they will receive 10 million shares of the 371 million shares outstanding, or in this case, a 1 to 1 conversion. If that is in fact what happens, each CEP share will be worth ~$25/share, assuming a total valuation of $9.2 billion ($9.2 billion/371 million shares). In the past month, Cantor Equity Partners' price has declined from its all-time high near $55 per share down to around $30 per share. This has it approaching a similar MNAV valuation as Strategy...around two times. Risks The risks of buying Cantor Equity Partners are varied. First, you are buying a Bitcoin treasury company that will have a pure exposure to owning Bitcoin. If you don't want to own Bitcoin, then owning shares of Cantor Equity Partners won't be advisable. Second, we don't have insight into the strategy of the new company, Twenty One Capital. If you buy Cantor Equity Partners today, then you are buying it blindly with the expectation that they will successfully implement their strategy to acquire more Bitcoin per share. And it is certainly possible and even likely that they do, but we don't have insight into how they plan to do that at the moment. Third, although the conversion ratio of Cantor Equity Partners shares is approximately expected to be 1 to 1, we won't know exactly how the conversion will look until after the merger takes place. Will the conversion ratio be 1 to 1, or will it be something less than that. Fourth, as we wait for the merger to finalize, Bitcoin might appreciate significantly, but with a certain degree of unknowns surrounding the merger, Cantor Equity Partners may fail to appreciate in price as fully as an established Bitcoin treasury company like Strategy. This represents an opportunity cost that is present with any investment. Conclusion I would consider Cantor Equity Partners as a hold for the moment. If you already own shares, I would not sell, but it might be prudent to wait for the conversion into XXI shares to get a better idea of the value proposition. I think the new shares of XXI will be worth researching to understand their strategy to increase shareholder returns in Bitcoin terms. The company will have a very impressive list of shareholders, which could come together to create compelling value as they find creative ways to bring Bitcoin to new and existing capital markets. As an alternative strategy to buying Cantor Equity Partners, one might hold Strategy shares until the merger takes place and convert shares into XXI shares after the merger. But for now, I rate Cantor Equity Partners a hold.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800150-cantor-equity-partners-waiting-on-merger-with-twenty-one-capital?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS|SPONSORED","CEP",cryptocompare
2025-07-09T14:39:09,"Whales That Started the Previous Ethereum Bull Run Are Back in Action! What Does It Mean for ETH?","Ethereum (ETH) has been more prominent than Bitcoin (BTC) in recent days. At this point, as institutions are rapidly switching from Bitcoin to ETH, million-dollar purchases are coming one after another. This suggests that Ethereum is gaining bullish momentum amid rising institutional inflows. Cryptocurrency market analysis firm 10X Research has noted in its new analysis that Ethereum is currently trading above both its 7-day and 30-day moving averages, indicating strong bullish momentum. ETH gained 3.6% last week, driven by $148.5 million in ETF inflows. BlackRock’s spot ETH ETF ETHA remains the market leader with $4.6 billion in assets under management (AUM). In other news, BitMine Immersion Technologies raised $250 million to implement an ETH-based treasury strategy, while SharpLink Gaming recently purchased $22.8 million worth of ETH, a sign of growing institutional demand and renewed investor confidence. Related News: Ethereum's MicroStrategy Receives ETH Purchase Again From Nasdaq-Listed Company! ""Retains Its Position as the World's Largest ETH Holder!"" Apart from 10X Research, Glassnode also announced its Ethereum analysis. At this point, Glassnode stated that aggressive whale purchases and the current situation could allow ETH to reach $3.4 thousand by August. Glassnode expects the strong buying frenzy by Ethereum whales to push the ETH price higher, data shows. At this point, the total amount of ETH held by whales holding at least 10,000 ETH increased by 9.31% from 37.56 million in October of last year to 41.06 million as of July 7. These figures also indicate that the pace of accumulation in the May-September 2022 period has almost doubled. At this point, analysts particularly pointed out that whales made similar aggressive purchases between November 2020 and January 2021, the amount of ETH held by whales increased by 4%, and then the ETH price skyrocketed from $ 460 to $ 1,220. *This is not investment advice.

So you’re still way ahead if you’re buying Bitcoin today. If you look at Bitcoin wallets, comparing it to the Internet, we’re back to 1996 levels. The Internet went exponential from 1996. So it’s still the earliest days. I think Bitcoin is very useful, because in the future we’re not going to be able to trust anything. There’s nothing secure anymore. We can sample your voice… You’ll never know what’s true anymore. You need to be able to trust a system. The Bitcoin blockchain is the most trusted blockchain, and that’s why the United States wants to have a million Bitcoin, US companies are buying Bitcoin [and] banks will soon carry Bitcoin as collateral.” Bitcoin is trading for $108,845 at time of writing, flat on the day. Lee also says that Ethereum is likely to surge in value due to the increasing popularity of stablecoins, which mostly operate over the ETH network. “Stablecoins run on Ethereum. As stablecoins explode…Ethereum is the backbone for stablecoins. So I think Ethereum is going to make a big comeback.” Ethereum is trading for $2,608 at time of writing, up 2.9% in the last 24 hours.

2025-07-09T14:19:34,"Top 4 reasons a major crypto bull run could be on the horizon","Bitcoin and most altcoins have remained in a narrow range this month as trade and interest rate risks persist. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has been stuck at $108,000, while altcoins like Ethereum ( ETH ) and Cardano ( ADA ) have moved sideways. Here are the top four reasons why a crypto bull run may still happen this year. Bitcoin price is on the cusp of a breakout Technical indicators suggest that Bitcoin is poised for a bullish breakout. The asset has formed a bullish flag pattern, characterized by a vertical pole followed by a descending channel. This flag formation overlaps with the handle section of a broader cup-and-handle pattern. The cup has a depth of roughly 30%, projecting a potential target above $140,000. Similarly, the flagpole measures approximately 35%. Projecting that distance from the breakout level at $109,300 points to a target exceeding $145,000. A strong move above this level could spark a broader crypto rally. Bitcoin price chart | Source: crypto.news Altcoins have formed bullish reversal patterns Most altcoins have developed the well-known bullish double-bottom reversal pattern. This formation emerged after a drop in April, a rebound in May, and a subsequent retest of April’s lows. Additionally, excluding Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins, altcoins have also formed a bullish falling wedge pattern, defined by two downward-sloping, converging trendlines. The upper trendline has tested swing highs since February 1, while the lower line tracks lows since February 7. The price has since broken above the wedge’s upper boundary, signaling further gains, potentially toward the May high of $0.348.

It has already reached deals with China, Vietnam, and the U.K., and preparations are underway for an agreement with the European Union. The main headline this week was a series of letters former President Trump sent to various countries, reaffirming that he won’t shift the August 1 deadline. However, much like with previous China negotiations, the letters are seen as a pressure tactic to accelerate deals. A broader trade agreement would likely boost both equity and crypto markets. Interest rate cuts An additional catalyst for a crypto bull run is the expectation of upcoming interest rate cuts. Economists anticipate the Federal Reserve could begin easing as early as its September meeting, provided inflation data continues to improve. Polymarket odds of a September rate cut stand at 50% and odds of a two-interest rate cuts have risen in the past few weeks. Interest rate cuts trigger a crypto bull run by pushing investors from the bond market to the market. On top of this, the Big Beautiful Bill will increase the amount of money in circulation, some of which will end in the crypto market.

2025-07-09T14:16:48,"Bitcoin braces for tariff shock, but ETFs could cushion the blow","Ongoing tariff risks could hurt Bitcoin’s safe haven narrative in the short term, according to a Bitfinex expert. Bitcoin’s (BTC) bullish case has long relied on its role as a hedge against inflation and geopolitical risk. However, the asset is now facing pressure from evolving U.S. trade policy, Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, said in comments to crypto.news. That said, Kooner noted that Bitcoin holds advantages it lacked in previous cycles—particularly growing institutional adoption and increasing exchange-traded fund flows. These developments could make BTC more resilient than equities in the face of geopolitical uncertainty. “New US tariffs would likely trigger classic risk-off reflexes with equity weakness, dollar strength, yield softness. But unlike past cycles, crypto now enjoys structural ETF support and sovereign hedge narrative,” said Jag Kooner, from Bitfinex. “While BTC may dip initially alongside equities, any tariff-induced inflation expectations or dollar weakening could feed back into crypto rates positively,” he added. Thanks to growing institutional adoption, more firms may now view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and macroeconomic volatility, especially if the dollar continues its downward trend, Kooner added. You might also like: In 2025 USD saw the worst performance since 1973. What challenges does the American dollar face these days? Bitcoin’s near-term catalysts to watch for In addition to inflation and trade concerns, there are other potential catalysts to watch for, Kooner stated. Specifically, traders will be looking at regulatory developments, especially those connected to the upcoming GENIUS Act. “Bitcoin’s climb near all-time highs is anchored by consistent ETF flows and strong institutional interest. The upcoming catalysts: legislative clarity, ETF innovation, tariff news, and inflation prints serve as potential accelerants,” Jag Kooner, Bitfinex. If Bitcoin breaks above its all-time high at $111,000, this could confirm a bullish trend in the near term, according to Kooner. However, a significant macro shock could push the asset back down to support between $105,000 and $108,000.

2025-07-09T14:07:50,"NEXBRIDGE and NEXPLACE Raise $8M Series A to Launch Integrated Bitcoin Capital Markets Ecosystem","July 9th, 2025 – San Salvador, El Salvador The raise will accelerate the development of a dual infrastructure: NEXBRIDGE, a regulated issuer of asset-backed digital assets, and NEXPLACE, a next-generation trading platform. NEXBRIDGE and NEXPLACE today announced the closing of a $8 million Series A funding round led by Fulgur Ventures. The capital will fast-track the expansion of a Bitcoin-native financial infrastructure that merges regulated issuance with seamless trading for retail and institutional clients worldwide. Early access to NEXPLACE is now available — users can join the waitlist here . NEXBRIDGE will use the proceeds to launch new digital assets and pursue additional listings across licensed exchanges. NEXPLACE will accelerate development and go-to-market execution ahead of its H2 2025 launch, while advancing further licensing efforts in key jurisdictions. NEXBRIDGE and NEXPLACE currently operate as separate entities, but share the same shareholder group and strategic roadmap— with plans to consolidate under a single holding once the necessary corporate and jurisdictional steps are completed. “Our vision for BitcoinFi is simple: bring the safeguards of traditional capital markets onto Bitcoin rails and make digital assets accessible with 24/7 efficiency— through compliant, global infrastructure,” said Michele Crivelli, Founder & CEO of both companies. Today we focus on secure access to familiar exposures like bonds or equities—made available through NEXPLACE and other licensed venues, with our own platform built to evolve and unlock advanced features over time. Tomorrow, we’ll enable businesses to raise capital on-chain through native, regulated digital instruments designed to move funds directly to the issuer, without traditional intermediaries.” A new on-chain market architecture NEXBRIDGE issues regulated digital assets backed by real underlying value, offering both familiar exposures and new formats for accessing them. In November 2024, NEXBRIDGE launched USTBL—the first public, regulated digital asset backed by U.S. Treasury Bills and issued on Bitcoin infrastructure via the Liquid Network. Initially listed on Bitfinex Securities, USTBL is now preparing to expand across additional licensed exchanges. Following this, El Salvador’s digital?asset regulator (CNAD) approved a broader range of products—spanning from single-stock exposures to multi-asset strategies—set to launch on NEXPLACE and other licensed venues, including through NEXBRIDGE’s own OTC desk. NEXPLACE, licensed as a Digital Asset Service Provider, offers a unified venue for trading a wide range of digital assets—from native cryptocurrencies and utility tokens to asset-linked instruments. Advanced features—such as using eligible tokenized assets as collateral for derivatives—will be gradually rolled out following launch. Unlike models where tokenized assets are mere digital wrappers of off-chain products, NEXBRIDGE issues digital assets that are regulated at the token level. Each issuance is formally approved by CNAD, receives a unique instrument identifier, and includes public disclosures such as proof-of-reserve attestations and a dedicated termsheet detailing key information. In this model, transparency and regulatory oversight apply directly to the digital asset users hold and trade—not just to the structure behind it. While initial distribution will occur primarily via NEXPLACE, the infrastructure is designed for openness. NEXBRIDGE’s regulatory architecture allows its assets to be listed on other licensed trading venues—ensuring portability. This dual model bridges two worlds: providing secure, regulated access to digital markets for global users—especially those in fast-growing emerging economies—while giving institutions a simplified interface to manage both crypto and asset-linked positions with full transparency. “This raise helps us unlock a new generation of asset-linked digital products—especially for users in markets where access to dollar-based exposure has been limited,” Crivelli added. “Each token we issue is directly regulated, with its own public termsheet, governance, and oversight—rather than being a passive mirror of an off-chain asset. That’s a structural shift – and a foundation we can build on.” Strategic alignment and investor support Fulgur Ventures, the lead investor, supports Bitcoin?native infrastructure with real?world applications. “Bitcoin continues to establish itself as a unique, scarce digital asset—now increasingly relevant to institutional finance,” said Oleg Mikhalsky, Partner at Fulgur Ventures. “Traditional financial institutions are beginning to recognize Bitcoin not only as a store of value but also as a settlement layer for both monetary transactions and tokenized instruments. NEXBRIDGE and NEXPLACE demonstrate a meaningful, real-world use case enabled by the Liquid Network that reinforces Bitcoin’s role in capital markets—a development Fulgur is proud to support.” Blockstream — the Bitcoin infrastructure firm behind the Liquid Network layer-2 that powers asset issuance and settlement — emphasized the partnership’s strategic potential. “By powering NEXBRIDGE’s digital asset issuance and NEXPLACE’s trading platform with the Liquid Network, we’re helping shape a new generation of capital markets—anchored to Bitcoin’s security, built for global scale, said Adam Back, Co?founder & CEO of Blockstream.

2025-07-09T14:04:07,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Hackers Target $8.7B Mt. Gox Wallet – Could a Breach Trigger Market Chaos?","Bitcoin is trading near $109,690 today, following a clean breakout above $109,000. But behind the price action, a historic BTC address tied to the Mt. Gox hack is back in the spotlight, and not for good reasons. According to BitMEX Research , scammers are targeting the wallet that received 79,956 BTC back in 2011, now worth over $8.7 billion. The method? A phishing transaction embedded with OP_RETURN, a tool that lets users write text directly onto Bitcoin’s blockchain. This particular message pointed the wallet owner to a suspicious website pretending to be from Salomon Brothers. There appears to be an ongoing Bitcoin scam occurring. Someone is sending old 2011 era Bitcoin addresses with balances, transactions with an OP_Return output. For instance the 1Feex… address, with c80,000 BTC stolen from MtGox. The OP_Return message is as follows “NOTICE TO… pic.twitter.com/lAT5ONPD4f — BitMEX Research (@BitMEXResearch) July 8, 2025 The wallet, long untouched, is part of the fallout from the Mt. Gox collapse, where 850,000 BTC vanished. Only 140,000 BTC have since been recovered, and many remaining coins sit idle in addresses like this one. This scam attempt isn’t just noise; it taps into broader market concerns about legacy wallets, lost coins, and what might happen if they move. While no breach has occurred, the timing aligns with a breakout on the chart, giving traders even more reason to stay alert. BTC/USD Breakout Above Triangle Structure ßOn the 2-hour chart, BTC broke through the upper boundary of a symmetrical triangle that had been forming since early July. That range had been squeezing tighter with higher lows and lower highs, so a volatility expansion was expected. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The price is now trading above the 50-period SMA ($108,550), and the structure is turning bullish again. The RSI is at 63.39, showing firm momentum without crossing into overbought territory. In short, buyers are in control—but not in a state of panic. Bitcoin breaks above $109K just as scammers target a dormant $8.7B Mt. Gox wallet. Clean symmetrical triangle breakout with RSI confirmation. Bulls eye $110.5K–$110.9K next. Structure looks solid unless we drop back below $108.2K. Watching the retest. #BTC #Crypto pic.twitter.com/hmIVXPEFiG — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) July 9, 2025 Resistance levels to watch are: $110,051 – prior swing high $110,550 – a clean breakout continuation zone $110,960 – extended resistance from June Trade Setup: Symmetrical Breakout with Retest Potential Here’s how I’d structure this trade: Breakout Strategy Entry: Above $109,200 (confirmed 2H breakout) Stop-loss: Below $108,250 (SMA + lower triangle line) Target 1: $110,051 Target 2: $110,550 Extended Target: $110,960 The breakout happened cleanly, and price held above the key moving average. If volume picks up, there’s room for this to run another 1–2% before facing real resistance. I’m watching how price behaves around $110K—if it stalls, partial profit makes sense. Retest Option If we get a dip back to $109,200, I’d look for a rejection candle (hammer or bullish engulfing) for a tighter re-entry. In my experience, these symmetrical triangle breakouts often come with one shakeout move before continuation. For now, the setup remains valid unless we see a daily close back below $108,250. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Over $2M as Price Rise Nears Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), has raised over $2 million in its public presale, with $2,061,881 out of a $2,510,240 target.

Designed to merge Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s speed, Bitcoin Hyper enables fast, low-cost smart contracts, dApps, and meme coin creation, all with seamless BTC bridging. The project is audited by Consult and engineered for scalability, trust, and simplicity. The golden cross of meme appeal and real utility has made Bitcoin Hyper a Layer 2 contender to watch in 2025.

2025-07-09T14:03:03,"NEXBRIDGE and NEXPLACE Raise $8M Series A to Launch Integrated Bitcoin Capital Markets Ecosystem","San Salvador, El Salvador, July 9th, 2025, Chainwire The raise will accelerate the development of a dual infrastructure: NEXBRIDGE, a regulated issuer of asset-backed digital assets, and NEXPLACE, a next-generation trading platform. NEXBRIDGE and NEXPLACE today announced the closing of a $8 million Series A funding round led by Fulgur Ventures. The capital will fast-track the expansion of a Bitcoin-native financial infrastructure that merges regulated issuance with seamless trading for retail and institutional clients worldwide. Early access to NEXPLACE is now available — users can join the waitlist here . NEXBRIDGE will use the proceeds to launch new digital assets and pursue additional listings across licensed exchanges. NEXPLACE will accelerate development and go-to-market execution ahead of its H2 2025 launch, while advancing further licensing efforts in key jurisdictions. NEXBRIDGE and NEXPLACE currently operate as separate entities, but share the same shareholder group and strategic roadmap— with plans to consolidate under a single holding once the necessary corporate and jurisdictional steps are completed. “Our vision for BitcoinFi is simple: bring the safeguards of traditional capital markets onto Bitcoin rails and make digital assets accessible with 24/7 efficiency— through compliant, global infrastructure,” said Michele Crivelli, Founder & CEO of both companies. Today we focus on secure access to familiar exposures like bonds or equities—made available through NEXPLACE and other licensed venues, with our own platform built to evolve and unlock advanced features over time. Tomorrow, we’ll enable businesses to raise capital on-chain through native, regulated digital instruments designed to move funds directly to the issuer, without traditional intermediaries.” A new on-chain market architecture NEXBRIDGE issues regulated digital assets backed by real underlying value, offering both familiar exposures and new formats for accessing them. In November 2024, NEXBRIDGE launched USTBL—the first public, regulated digital asset backed by U.S. Treasury Bills and issued on Bitcoin infrastructure via the Liquid Network. Initially listed on Bitfinex Securities, USTBL is now preparing to expand across additional licensed exchanges. Following this, El Salvador’s digital‑asset regulator (CNAD) approved a broader range of products—spanning from single-stock exposures to multi-asset strategies—set to launch on NEXPLACE and other licensed venues, including through NEXBRIDGE’s own OTC desk. NEXPLACE, licensed as a Digital Asset Service Provider, offers a unified venue for trading a wide range of digital assets—from native cryptocurrencies and utility tokens to asset-linked instruments. Advanced features—such as using eligible tokenized assets as collateral for derivatives—will be gradually rolled out following launch. Unlike models where tokenized assets are mere digital wrappers of off-chain products, NEXBRIDGE issues digital assets that are regulated at the token level. Each issuance is formally approved by CNAD, receives a unique instrument identifier, and includes public disclosures such as proof-of-reserve attestations and a dedicated termsheet detailing key information. In this model, transparency and regulatory oversight apply directly to the digital asset users hold and trade—not just to the structure behind it. While initial distribution will occur primarily via NEXPLACE, the infrastructure is designed for openness. NEXBRIDGE’s regulatory architecture allows its assets to be listed on other licensed trading venues—ensuring portability. This dual model bridges two worlds: providing secure, regulated access to digital markets for global users—especially those in fast-growing emerging economies—while giving institutions a simplified interface to manage both crypto and asset-linked positions with full transparency. “This raise helps us unlock a new generation of asset-linked digital products—especially for users in markets where access to dollar-based exposure has been limited,” Crivelli added. “Each token we issue is directly regulated, with its own public termsheet, governance, and oversight—rather than being a passive mirror of an off-chain asset. That’s a structural shift - and a foundation we can build on.” Strategic alignment and investor support Fulgur Ventures, the lead investor, supports Bitcoin‑native infrastructure with real‑world applications. “Bitcoin continues to establish itself as a unique, scarce digital asset—now increasingly relevant to institutional finance,” said Oleg Mikhalsky, Partner at Fulgur Ventures. “Traditional financial institutions are beginning to recognize Bitcoin not only as a store of value but also as a settlement layer for both monetary transactions and tokenized instruments. NEXBRIDGE and NEXPLACE demonstrate a meaningful, real-world use case enabled by the Liquid Network that reinforces Bitcoin’s role in capital markets—a development Fulgur is proud to support.” Blockstream — the Bitcoin infrastructure firm behind the Liquid Network layer-2 that powers asset issuance and settlement — emphasized the partnership’s strategic potential. “By powering NEXBRIDGE’s digital asset issuance and NEXPLACE’s trading platform with the Liquid Network, we’re helping shape a new generation of capital markets—anchored to Bitcoin’s security, built for global scale, said Adam Back, Co‑founder & CEO of Blockstream. Early access to NEXPLACE is now available — users can join the waitlist here . About NEXBRIDGE NEXBRIDGE Digital Financial Solutions is a regulated issuer headquartered in El Salvador. It creates and offers asset-linked digital assets under the country’s Digital Asset Issuance Law, with settlement secured through the Bitcoin-based Liquid Network. About NEXPLACE NEXPLACE is a next-generation digital asset exchange set to launch publicly in the second half of 2025. It enables seamless trading across cryptocurrencies and regulated digital assets—within a unified venue designed to evolve with market needs.

2025-07-09T14:00:18,"Bitcoin Hits Record High, But Mainstream Media Coverage Remains Sparse and Divided:  Report","Bitcoin surge to an all-time high during the second quarter did not translate into substantial mainstream media coverage, with new data revealing a polarized and low-volume reporting landscape. Market intelligence firm Perception reported that only 1,116 articles on Bitcoin and crypto were published across 18 major media outlets during Q2, reflecting what it described as a “deeply polarized narrative landscape.” Perception’s report, released on Tuesday, noted that sentiment across outlets was split: 31% of articles were positive toward Bitcoin, 41% remained neutral, while 28% carried a negative tone. Despite BTC’s record performance, the firm highlighted that elite financial publications left a vacuum in informed crypto reporting. Elite Financial Media Largely Absent The report pointed out a significant lack of coverage from leading financial outlets. News Corp’s The Wall Street Journal published just two Bitcoin-related articles throughout Q2 , while the Financial Times and The New York Times together published only 11 articles in the same period. These three publications accounted for merely 2% of all mainstream Bitcoin and crypto coverage during the quarter. Perception argued that this limited attention from agenda-setting outlets has led to a fragmented information environment around BTC, potentially leaving investors uninformed about a transformative asset class. “Investors relying on elite financial media for market intelligence are systematically underinformed,” the report stated. Several Narratives Shaping Public Perception According to Perception, mainstream media outlets have approached Bitcoin with three primary narratives: “enthusiastic adoption,” “willful blindness,” and “persistent skepticism.” Outlets like Forbes and CNBC fell into the first category, providing extensive and optimistic coverage of BTC and crypto. In contrast, the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times demonstrated what Perception termed “willful blindness,” offering minimal coverage despite Bitcoin’s significant market developments. Traditional media outlets, meanwhile, maintained a “persistent skepticism,” focusing on crime and controversy within the crypto industry. Content analysis from the report revealed differing topic priorities across publications. Forbes highlighted retail and institutional adoption along with Bitcoin mining, while CNBC focused heavily on banking, finance, and investment vehicles. Fortune covered mining, finance, and market analysis, while Fox News concentrated on legal issues, crime, and cybersecurity concerns related to crypto. Perception concluded that this uneven coverage fosters “information asymmetry,” complicating the landscape for investors seeking consistent and clear reporting on BTC as it continues to evolve into a mainstream financial asset.

2025-07-09T14:00:11,"Analyst Predicts 50% “Moonshot” For XRP Price If This Line Breaks","Crypto analyst Jaydee has predicted a 50% rally for the XRP price. He highlighted a resistance level, which the altcoin needs to break above on its BTC pair to record this massive uptrend. XRP Price Eyes 50% Rally With Break Above $2.20 In an X post, Jaydee predicted that the XRP price will record a 50% “moonshot” rally once it breaks above the $0.00002 resistance level on its Bitcoin pair. XRP has since broken above this resistance level, suggesting that this moonshot rally may be imminent, with the altcoin surging to as high as $3.35. Related Reading: Analyst Reveals Rational Behind XRP Price Reaching $9.5 And $37.5 A rally to $3.35 will bring the XRP price close to its current all-time high (ATH) of $3.84 and also mark a new yearly high for the altcoin. In a subsequent analysis, Jaydee confirmed that XRP could rally to new ATHs with a successful break above this resistance level. On the other hand, he warned that the altcoin could crash to as low as $1.60 if it fails to hold this level on at least the 3-day timeframe. Crypto analyst Guy also recently predicted that the XRP price could rally to a new ATH of $5.30. The analyst indicated that the $2.33 level is the key to kickstarting this uptrend for the altcoin. Once XRP breaks above, he predicts that it will rally to $2.55. A break above this $2.55 level would then pave the way for another rally to the current ATH and the Fibonacci extension at $5.30. Possible Scenarios Following Break Above $2.30 In an X post, crypto analyst CasiTrades outlined three potential scenarios that could unfold following the XRP price break above $2.30. The first scenario is the cleanest move, in which she predicts that XRP could run towards $2.45, then flips $2.30 into support on a backtest. CasiTrades remarked that this gives the altcoin a solid base for a move to $2.69 and beyond. Related Reading: Will XRP Dethrone Ethereum To Lead This Altcoin Season? For the second scenario, the crypto analyst described this as a more aggressive move. In this case, she predicts that the XRP price could record a sharp breakout through $2.30 and head straight to $2.69. From there, she added that the altcoin could pull back to $2.45 as the mid-way support zone before continuing its uptrend. The third scenario is the most bullish for the XRP price. CasiTrades predicts that the altcoin could break through $2.69, confirm this price level as support, and then clear the way towards $3 and above. This would then put the current ATH in sight for the altcoin. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.32, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

2025-07-09T13:57:18,"Profitability Rates for Long-Term Bitcoin Investors Approach Critical Level! Could Selling Pressure Be Possible? Here Are the Details","According to crypto analysts, long-term Bitcoin investors (LTH) are making 215% more profit than their average cost, which could trigger a potential sell-off. Long-Term Bitcoin Investors Approach Critical Profitability Threshold: Is a Market Sell-Off Imminent? Data shows that long-term investors typically sell after exceeding the 300% return threshold, taking profits. Currently, while investors are still far from this threshold, the market has entered a critical zone between “steady profit-taking” and “risk of a sharp sell-off.” This type of investor behavior typically signals a market turning point, and analysts warn that significant Bitcoin price volatility could occur if large-scale profit-taking begins at these levels. According to experts, despite investor pressure to take profits, the overall market structure remains strong. However, if the 300% profitability threshold is breached, particularly if combined with macroeconomic conditions or negative news flow, there could be significant selling by long-term investors. This could lead to a sharp correction in Bitcoin's price. In summary, the market is currently on the cusp between a controlled profit-taking and a long-term sell-off. The coming weeks will be critical for investors to determine which direction this threshold will be crossed. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-09T13:56:07,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Marginally Up As Markets Wait For Next Catalyst","Bitcoin (BTC) price action picked up during the ongoing session, with the flagship cryptocurrency up nearly 1% as buyers attempted to cross the crucial $110,000 mark. BTC started the week in the red, dropping nearly 1% on Monday before recovering on Tuesday, rising from a low of $107,446 to $108,938. The price is up almost 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $109,516. Remixpoint Moves To Align CEO With Bitcoin Strategy Remixpoint has announced that new CEO Takashi Tashiro will be paid in Bitcoin as part of efforts to be “in the same boat” as shareholders. The company said it will calculate Tashiro’s salary and taxes, purchase the equivalent amount in BTC , and transfer it to a wallet Tashiro chooses. According to the company, the move is part of a “shareholder-oriented management.” “The remuneration in this case will be paid in Japanese yen in format based on the appropriate organization of the Company Act and taxation. On top of that, we plan to acquire Bitcoin (BTC) equivalent to the same amount at the market price with Japanese yen, which is equivalent to the full amount of the payment, and deliver it to the crypto asset wallet designated by the President and CEO.” Tashiro took over as Remixpoint CEO in June, stating the firm will put BTC at the heart of its financial strategy. H100 Raises $54 Million For Bitcoin Treasury H100 Group AB, a Swedish health-tech firm focusing on AI-driven health solutions, has closed two key funding rounds, raising $54 million. The firm raised capital via a directed share issue (Tranche 6, issuing 27.17 million shares at SEK 6.38), and a directed convertible debenture issue (Tranche 7, SEK 342.3 million. The directed share issue diluted existing shareholders by around 10%. However, if all convertible shares from Tranche 7 are converted, it could cause an additional dilution of around 14%. The company plans to use the funds for its Bitcoin treasury strategy. The funding comes after H100 secured a $15.82 million convertible loan guarantee from Blockstream CEO Adam Beck to help accelerate its planned Bitcoin acquisitions. This followed a $2.2 million raise in May, also led by Beck. Other investors in this round included Crafoord Capital Partners and Morten Klein. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is up almost 1% during the ongoing session as buyers eye a move past $110,000. The flagship cryptocurrency ended the weekend positively, rising nearly 1% on Sunday to settle at $109,231. Despite the positive close to the weekend, BTC lost momentum on Monday, dropping 0.88% and settling at $108,273. It fell to a low of $107,446 on Tuesday but rebounded, rising 0.61% to reclaim $108,000 and settle at $108,938 before reclaiming $109,000 during the ongoing session. With momentum building, traders are optimistic about a move to $110,000. However, blockchain analytics platform Santiment has warned that optimism isn’t always a positive sign. Santiment analyst Brian Quinlivan stated, “It’s pretty clear that the crowd is starting to salivate over a potential $110K+ Bitcoin market value.” Santiment analyzed social media chatter about Bitcoin and found that for every bearish comment for the flagship cryptocurrency, there were 1.51 bullish comments. Santiment based its findings on data from several platforms, including X, Reddit, 4chan, Telegram, BitcoinTalk, and Farcaster. The analytics platform cautioned that similar optimism was followed by substantial declines on two previous occasions. “As we know, prices move in the opposite direction of the crowd’s expectations as retail perpetually loses money from overly emotional decisions.” Santiment believes BTC will experience a pullback before breaking through its all-time high of $111,970, set on May 22. Santiment analysts also highlighted that Bitcoin whale wallets have shown little activity in recent sessions, indicating caution. “For now, these wallets have been somewhat suspiciously flat. When they accumulate, prices often follow closely. When they dump or even just temporarily stop accumulating, it often signals that market values across crypto may see some declines.” BTC ended the previous weekend on a bullish note, rising nearly 1% to close at $108,350. Despite the positive weekend, it lost momentum on Monday, dropping 1.09% to $107,168. Selling pressure intensified on Tuesday as BTC fell 1.33%, slipping below $106,000 and settling at $105,740. Despite the selling pressure, the price recovered on Wednesday, rising nearly 3% to $108,845. Buyers retained control on Thursday as the price reached an intraday high of $110,583 before settling at $109,650, ultimately registering a 0.74% increase. Price action was back in bearish territory on Friday, dropping 1.42% to $108,097.

""Much like the company’s first HPC deal with CoreWeave announced last summer, the terms and purchase price appear to be a one-off,"" analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote. CoreWeave said Monday it had agreed to buy Core Scientific in an all-stock transaction valuing the bitcoin miner at about $20.40 per share, based on recent closing prices. The bank's analysts noted that Core Scientific closed at around a 25% discount to the deal terms the day the takeover was announced. Given the year-end projected close, the analysts said this seemed appropriate. B.Riley downgraded Core Scientific from buy to neutral with an unchanged $17 price target, the broker said in a research report Wednesday.

According to a July 9 disclosure , Remixpoint has secured 31.5 billion yen, worth approximately $215 million, through its latest round of financing. Every yen of the funds will go toward buying more Bitcoin ( BTC ) purchases, boosting the accumulation streak it commenced back in 2024. The company also revealed its short-term mission, which is to grow its holdings to 3,000 BTC. Per its statement, the actual number of coins acquired will depend on Bitcoin’s market price and Remixpoint’s stock performance, as purchase prices will be based on the average share value across three consecutive trading days post-transaction. Remixpoint added that its reseve decision followed a lengthy internal debate. While opinions among leadership were divided, the board ultimately agreed that expanding BTC exposure is the right move to push the company into its next growth stage.

2025-07-09T13:30:20,"Ethereum Price Action Signals Momentum Shift: BTC Sleeps And ETH Moves","Ethereum has finally pushed above the critical $2,600 level after weeks of range-bound trading, marking a potential turning point in its price structure. This breakout comes as bullish momentum builds, with Ethereum now preparing for a possible expansion toward the $2,800 resistance level—a zone that has repeatedly rejected upward attempts since early May. The coming days will be decisive in shaping Ethereum’s short-term trajectory, especially if bulls manage to drive the price beyond this key barrier. Related Reading: ERC-20 Stablecoin Supply Hits All-Time High At $121B – Liquidity On The Rise A breakout above $2,800 would not only signal renewed strength in Ethereum but could also catalyze a broader altcoin rally. Market sentiment is gradually shifting, with traders growing more optimistic amid easing macroeconomic pressures and signs of renewed risk appetite. Top analyst Ted Pillows recently shared an Ethereum chart showing a clear upward breakout from compression. This technical pattern typically precedes strong directional moves, and in this case, it favors the bulls. Pillows suggests that Ethereum is taking the lead while Bitcoin remains in consolidation, indicating that ETH may be setting the pace for the next phase of the crypto cycle. All eyes are now on the $2,800 level, which could unlock significant upside if breached. Ethereum Leads the Charge: Major Move Ahead Since early May, Ethereum has traded within a tight consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,700, unable to break out despite several attempts. This extended period of sideways action has built up pressure, and market participants widely expect the next move to be significant. Bulls have shown resilience, defending demand levels and keeping ETH above the $2,500 mark for several weeks. However, a clear breakout above critical resistance is still needed to confirm a broader bullish trend. Altcoins continue to struggle, with most still trading below key resistance levels. Many analysts agree that a sustained Ethereum breakout is the missing trigger for the long-awaited altseason. Market leadership from ETH has historically marked the start of major altcoin rallies, and the current setup could be no different. Top analyst Ted Pillows shared a 4-hour chart highlighting an upward breakout from a compression pattern just above $2,600. According to Pillow’s analysis, Ethereum is leading the market while Bitcoin remains in a holding pattern below all-time highs. This leadership role for ETH could signal a shift in capital toward altcoins, especially if Ethereum follows through and breaks the $2,800 resistance level. Related Reading: Ethereum Turns Key Resistance Into Support – Momentum Builds For Range Breakout ETH Price Analysis: Upward Momentum Builds Above $2,600 Ethereum (ETH) is showing renewed strength after breaking above the key $2,600 level. The 12-hour chart reveals a bullish structure forming, with ETH currently trading at $2,612.61. This move follows a sustained period of consolidation between $2,400 and $2,600, where buyers consistently defended lower levels. Now, Ethereum is printing higher lows and gradually reclaiming its moving averages. Price is now trading above the 50-period and 100-period simple moving averages (SMAs), currently positioned at $2,483.37 and $2,536.77, respectively. This alignment is bullish and suggests ETH is building momentum for a potential retest of the $2,700–$2,800 resistance zone. A successful break above this area would confirm the breakout from compression and open the door for a more significant rally.

2025-07-09T13:29:25,"Crypto.com strikes travel payments deal with Emirates airline","The airline is teaming up with the crypto exchange to introduce crypto payments in travel, aiming to meet growing customer demand for digital asset options. According to a July 9 announcement , Emirates has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Crypto.com to integrate digital payments into its services. The rollout will begin with Crypto.com Pay, allowing customers to use cryptocurrency as a payment option for flights and other transactions. The agreement was formalized in Dubai, witnessed by Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman and CEO of Emirates Airline & Group. It was signed by Adnan Kazim, Emirates’ Deputy President and Chief Commercial Officer, and Mohammed Al Hakim, President of Crypto.com’s UAE operations. You might also like: Crypto.com joins CF Benchmarks, enhancing Bitcoin and Ethereum indices Emirates stated that the move reflects its broader digital strategy and goal of offering flexible payment options for customers. The partnership builds on its earlier interest in crypto payments dating back to 2022, when COO Adel Ahmed Al-Redha had floated plans to accept Bitcoin (BTC) shortly after the UAE introduced crypto-friendly regulations. Commenting on the deal, Emirates’ Deputy President and Chief Commercial Officer Adnan Kazim said the airline sees growing demand and momentum around crypto as a legitimate payment method, especially among tech-driven travelers. “Partnering with Crypto.com to integrate cryptocurrency into our digital payments system reflects Emirates’ commitment to meeting evolving customer preferences, in addition to tapping into younger, tech-savvy customer segments who prefer digital currencies,” he said. Crypto.com President and COO Eric Anziani added that the partnership marks another step in expanding real-world use cases for crypto payments, and will drive momentum for the broader digital asset industry. The feature is expected to go live next year, once internal readiness and regulatory approvals are in place. Both Emirates and Crypto.com will also explore leveraging promotional marketing campaigns to create awareness and encourage adoption of this new payment solution. If completed, Emirates would become one of the first major international airlines to fully integrate crypto into its payment stack.

The market also hosts major European companies such as Air France KLM, Nestlé, and Intesa Sanpaolo. This listing will not involve issuing new shares or raising capital. Instead, existing shares currently traded on Euronext Growth Paris will be made available to US investors through a secondary listing on the OTCID market. Shares will be traded in US dollars and settled according to US market standards via market makers who will facilitate liquidity and compliance.

The BTC purchases were funded through strategic capital raises , enabling the company to steadily increase its BTC holdings and reinforce its position as a leading Bitcoin Treasury Company . As of the latest report , The Blockchain Group and its Luxembourg unit now hold a total of 1,904 BTC, acquired for a cumulative €172 million, with an average entry price of approximately €90,332 per BTC. This represents about 1.12% of the 170,000 BTC target the company aims to accumulate by 2032. Continued Bitcoin buys are clearly paying off for The Blockchain Group, which recently reported an impressive year-to-date BTC yield of approximately 1,349%.

2025-07-09T13:15:22,"New ATH in view as SPX6900 (SPX) breaks out from a critical pattern","SPX6900 (SPX) is in the spotlight after staging a powerful breakout that now has traders eyeing a potential new all-time high. Over the past 24 hours, the memecoin surged 8.7%, signalling a bullish continuation that’s drawing renewed attention across both technical and derivatives markets. Today’s price surge comes as SPX6900 sees a rare convergence of bullish signals, including an ascending triangle breakout, a golden cross, strong volume expansion, and a textbook Cup & Handle pattern, all of which point toward the possibility of explosive upside in the near term. Ascending triangle breakout sparks optimism Since June 20, SPX6900 has been consolidating within an ascending triangle in the 4-hour chart, a classic bullish structure marked by rising lows and a flat resistance ceiling. That resistance level, clearly defined at $1.38, held firm until July 9 when the token broke through decisively, backed by solid volume and a bounce from the 100-day moving average at $1.22. SPX6900 (SPX) ascending triangle breakout | Source: TradingView Following the breakout, SPX tapped $1.4476 and is currently stabilising around $1.42, with traders closely watching for a retest of the $1.38 level to confirm this move. If the token successfully holds above this key support, analysts anticipate a potential push toward $1.86, which would validate the triangle’s measured move projection. Golden cross confirms SPX’s bullish setup Adding to the ascending triangle breakout is the confirmed golden cross, where the 50-day exponential moving average has crossed above the 200-day EMA. SPX6900 (SPX) breaks out from a critical pattern | Source: TradingView This powerful technical signal, now visible on the daily chart, typically marks the beginning of a sustained bullish trend, and it arrives just as the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) histogram flipped positive for the first time since June. Momentum indicators now align in favour of buyers, especially with volume climbing steadily and derivatives markets flashing green. Open interest, according to Coinalyze, has also surged by over 18% to $103.7 million at press time, with an overwhelming 82% of those positions favouring longs, signalling growing institutional confidence. Recent SPX6900 (SPX) listing on Tokocrypto is fueling the buying pressure Another catalyst driving SPX’s price surge is its recent listing on Tokocrypto , which opened the token to a wider audience across Southeast Asia. This strategic move came on July 8 and led to a sharp 75.8% spike in 24-hour trading volume, now sitting at over $91 million. The increased accessibility has not only deepened liquidity but also amplified momentum during a week when memecoins have outperformed broader altcoins. As Bitcoin (BTC) edged lower by 0.36%, money flowed into smaller-cap assets like SPX6900 (SPX), which gained favour during this shift in market sentiment. Cup & handle pattern signals more upside Perhaps most compelling is the Cup & Handle pattern now forming on SPX6900’s daily chart, offering a roadmap for a potential breakout toward $2.50 or higher. The rounded bottom of the cup is already in place, and the handle, a narrow consolidation range, indicates a healthy pause before a renewed push upward. SPX6900 (SPX) cup and handle formation | Source: TradingView Volume has been gradually building, and traders are now on alert for a breakout candle that could serve as the final trigger. If confirmed, the pattern’s measured move projects nearly a 98% gain from current levels, pushing SPX close to the $2.70 resistance zone. SPX6900 price outlook: crowded longs pose short-term risks Despite the overwhelmingly bullish picture, traders are keeping a close eye on one potential red flag, crowded long positioning. With funding rates rising to their highest point since mid-June and the majority of traders paying premiums to hold longs, the market is vulnerable to sharp corrections. While RSI remains in neutral territory at 56.18, suggesting there’s still room for upside, any failure to hold $1.38 could result in a fakeout and trap late buyers. However, with SPX6900’s current all-time high sitting at $1.73, set just under a month ago, the current price action puts a fresh breakout within striking distance. Traders are now watching whether the Cup & Handle formation will resolve to the upside, which could not only breach the ATH but also set the stage for a major rally through the $2 range.

Through SharpLink Gaming, which he chairs, Lubin is spearheading efforts to accumulate large amounts of ETH. He describes these treasuries as essential for creating scarcity and driving long-term value. SharpLink recently boosted its ETH holdings to over 205,000 tokens worth $533 million, which resulted in a 28% surge in its stock price. Meanwhile, ReserveOne is set to go public through a $1 billion SPAC merger to help expand its own crypto reserve strategy. Joseph Lubin Pushes Ethereum Treasuries Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Joseph Lubin recently talked about the importance of ETH treasuries when it comes to driving the growth and sustainability of the Ethereum ecosystem. In a recent interview with CNBC, Lubin explained that while a big amount of ETH is in circulation, there is not enough usage to support healthy supply-demand dynamics. To address this imbalance, he is spearheading efforts at SharpLink Gaming, a company he chairs that aims to build Ethereum-based treasuries. Lubin described Ether treasuries as a “great business to run” and essential to making the Ethereum economy function more efficiently. SharpLink’s mission, according to Lubin, is to help communicate the Ethereum narrative in a way that resonates with traditional finance, particularly Wall Street investors who are increasingly seeking profitable opportunities in digital assets. He argued that ETH treasuries can play a pivotal role in generating both interest and scarcity around Ethereum by acquiring and holding large amounts. “We’re able to acquire tens of millions of dollars in Ether a day,” Lubin pointed out, suggesting that this accumulation will drive long-term value. Lubin is very confident in the future of both Bitcoin and Ethereum, and stated that he expects both assets to appreciate over the coming years and decades as global systems gradually decentralize. He also believes that the Ethereum network is now equipped to support Web3 development at scale, and called it “scalable enough, affordable enough, legal enough in the United States.” This is a shift from earlier challenges the network faced, including regulatory uncertainties. On the regulatory front, Lubin criticized the former SEC Chair Gary Gensler for hindering the Ethereum ecosystem’s development by creating a climate that discouraged token issuance and application building. He believes those constraints are now lifted, thanks to Gensler’s recent departure and the appointment of Paul Atkins. Paul Atkins Atkins became the 34th chair of the SEC in April, and signaled a much more favorable stance toward blockchain innovation. Overall, Lubin’s comments suggest that this regulatory thaw could be the start of a new wave of growth for Ethereum and the Web3 space. SharpLink Stock Soars on ETH Buys Shareholders of the Lubin-chaired SharpLink also seem to agree that an Ethereum treasury is the way to go. Shares in SharpLink Gaming surged by over 28% on Tuesday after the company revealed that it increased its Ethereum holdings to 205,634 ETH, valued at more than $533 million. The announcement revealed a buying spree between June 28 and July 4, during which SharpLink acquired 7,689 ETH for over $19 million at an average price of $2,501. The stock closed at $16.29 and rose even more during after-hours to $17. Sharplink Gaming share price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) This recent purchase took place after a similar move on June 25, when SharpLink’s shares climbed 7% to $9.66 after it announced a $30 million Ether acquisition that boosted its holdings to 188,000 ETH. SharpLink has made it very clear that its treasury strategy is focused squarely on Ethereum. During the latest accumulation period, the company raised $64 million in net proceeds by selling more than 5.4 million shares, with a large portion of the capital earmarked for further Ether purchases. On May 30, SharpLink disclosed plans to sell up to $1 billion in common shares, primarily to fund future Ethereum buys. This came just days after a formal announcement on May 27 that the firm was shifting toward an Ethereum-focused treasury strategy. Despite a sharp 73% drop in after-hours trading on June 12, it seems like the company was able to regain investor confidence with its consistent ETH accumulation. SharpLink also staked all of its Ether holdings, earning 322 ETH in rewards since June 2, which is currently worth approximately $848,750. Additionally, the company introduced a new metric, ETH Concentration, to highlight its Ether exposure in relation to its equity structure. Joseph Lubin stated that the company continues to refine its treasury strategy and attributes its success to a disciplined ETH-centric approach and a strong commitment to transparency. SharpLink’s bold move is part of the growing trend among companies allocating corporate treasuries into crypto assets. While Bitcoin is still a popular choice, some firms are opting for altcoins. Bit Digital, for instance, announced on Monday that it sold 280 Bitcoin to pivot its treasury toward Ethereum. Merger Fuels ReserveOne Crypto Strategy ReserveOne, a digital asset management company, is set to go public through a merger with M3-Brigade Acquisition V Corp.. This is according to an announcement made on Tuesday. The deal is projected to bring in more than $1 billion in gross proceeds, which will be used to boost ReserveOne’s crypto reserve strategy. This strategy focuses on accumulating a range of digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, as part of its long-term investment thesis. Jaime Leverton, CEO of ReserveOne, described the move as a step toward reinforcing the company’s dedication to responsible innovation, financial inclusion, and the advancement of a more transparent and resilient digital asset market. Leverton is widely recognized in the cryptocurrency industry for her leadership roles at Bitcoin mining firms Hut 8 and Riot Platforms. She served as CEO of Hut 8 for three years and currently sits on the board of directors at Riot Platforms. Jaime Leverton M3-Brigade Acquisition V Corp. is part of a joint venture between M3 Partners and Brigade Capital Management. The firm specializes in Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs), a model that allows companies to go public through private mergers. M3-Brigade previously brought Greenfire Resources and Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives to public markets using this strategy. Once the merger is finalized, ReserveOne will be listed on Nasdaq and trade under the tickers RONE and RONEW. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2025. Crypto reserve companies like ReserveOne have become increasingly popular since 2024, by offering investors a way to gain exposure to digital assets without directly holding tokens. Other companies following similar strategies include Michael Saylor’s Strategy, Metaplanet, Semler Scientific, SOL Strategies, and DeFi Development Corp.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9867/lubin-backs-eth-treasuries-to-boost-ecosystem-use,"ETH|REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Both short-term and long-term holders have been increasing their stacks as distinct cohorts, which is unusual because these groups typically act in opposite directions, according to Glassnode data. The chart below from Glassnode illustrates the 155-day threshold used to classify coins as belonging to Long-Term Holders (LTH) or Short-Term Holders (STH). Since June 22, the LTH supply has increased by 13,000 BTC, returning to an all-time high of 14,713,345 BTC. Meanwhile, over the same period, STHs have grown their BTC supply by more than 60,000 BTC and now hold over 2.3 million BTC. According to Glassnode data, LTH and STH cohorts usually diverge because LTHs often sell into bull market strength, while STHs tend to buy amid market greed and euphoria. This alignment suggests that both groups of market participants are expecting higher prices. If both cohorts continue increasing their supply, there is a strong possibility that all-time highs will be surpassed.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/09/patterns-break-as-both-short-and-long-term-holder-cohorts-accumulate-bitcoin,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Glassnode|Bitcoin|News",cryptocompare
