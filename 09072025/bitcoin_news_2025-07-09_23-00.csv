2025-07-09T20:40:35,"Ethereum’s Explosive Strength: Unleashing the Next Altcoin Season?","The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with anticipation, and at the heart of this excitement is Ethereum (ETH) . Recent observations from leading crypto data analytics firm Swissblock have ignited discussions about a potential shift in the market dynamics, suggesting that ETH’s impressive performance could be the precursor to something truly significant: the much-awaited Altcoin Season . Are we on the cusp of a major rally for alternative cryptocurrencies? Let’s dive deep into the insights and what they mean for your portfolio. Understanding Ethereum’s Recent Performance For weeks, market watchers have kept a keen eye on Ethereum’s trajectory. While Bitcoin often dominates headlines, ETH has quietly, yet powerfully, been making its moves. Swissblock, in a recent analysis shared on X, highlighted several key indicators that point to Ethereum’s growing dominance and robust health within the broader digital asset landscape. They noted a significant increase in ETH inflows, suggesting renewed investor interest and confidence. More importantly, Ethereum has demonstrated a remarkable outperformance when compared to Bitcoin, a critical metric often seen as a bellwether for the overall health of the altcoin market. This relative strength isn’t just a fleeting moment; it signifies a deeper underlying shift in market sentiment and capital allocation. What makes this particular period stand out for Ethereum? Increased Inflows: A surge in capital flowing into ETH, indicating strong buying pressure and investor confidence. Outperformance vs. Bitcoin: ETH consistently gaining ground against BTC, a historical precursor to altcoin rallies. Ecosystem Growth: Continuous development and adoption across DeFi, NFTs, and Layer-2 solutions on the Ethereum network. What Does Swissblock Analysis Reveal? The core of the recent excitement stems directly from the meticulous Swissblock analysis . This firm, known for its data-driven insights, isn’t just making speculative claims; their observations are rooted in on-chain metrics and market behavior. According to their findings, if Ethereum manages to sustain its current strength over the crucial next 72 hours, it could solidify the signs of an impending altcoin season. But what exactly are they looking at? It’s a combination of quantitative and qualitative factors: Swissblock’s methodology often involves: Metric Observed Significance Implication for Altseason ETH Dominance Percentage of total crypto market cap held by Ethereum. Rising dominance often pulls other altcoins up. ETH/BTC Ratio Ethereum’s price performance relative to Bitcoin. A rising ratio signals ETH leading the market. Exchange Netflows Movement of ETH in and out of exchanges. Increased inflows of capital into ETH. Positive capital inflows suggest strong buying pressure and accumulation. Funding Rates Cost of holding long/short positions in perpetual futures. Positive funding rates for ETH indicate bullish sentiment in derivatives. The firm’s focus on the 72-hour window emphasizes the volatility and rapid shifts inherent in the crypto market. Sustained performance over this period would provide a stronger confirmation signal, moving from mere speculation to a more concrete market trend. This is not just about ETH price strength in isolation; it’s about its ability to act as a catalyst for the broader altcoin ecosystem. Is the Altcoin Season Imminent? The phrase “ Altcoin Season ” sends shivers of excitement down the spines of many crypto enthusiasts. But what exactly is it, and are we truly on the brink? An altcoin season is generally defined as a period where alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) significantly outperform Bitcoin. During such times, investors typically rotate profits from Bitcoin into altcoins, leading to explosive growth across a wide range of smaller cap assets. Historically, these seasons have been driven by a combination of factors: Bitcoin Dominance Peak: Often, an altseason begins after Bitcoin has had a significant rally and its dominance (its share of the total crypto market capitalization) starts to decline. Innovation and Development: New projects, technological breakthroughs, and increasing utility within various altcoin ecosystems attract fresh capital. Investor Sentiment: A general bullish sentiment across the market, encouraging risk-taking and diversification into higher-risk, higher-reward assets. Given Ethereum’s current momentum and the ETH price strength observed by Swissblock, the conditions are certainly ripening. Ethereum, as the largest altcoin and a foundational layer for countless other projects, often leads the charge. Its strength signals that capital is flowing beyond Bitcoin and into the broader crypto landscape, which is exactly what precedes an altseason. Navigating the Current Crypto Market Dynamics Understanding the broader crypto market is crucial when anticipating an altcoin season. The market is a complex interplay of various forces, including macroeconomic trends, regulatory developments, and technological advancements. While Ethereum’s performance is a strong indicator, it doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Key factors influencing the current market dynamics include: Macroeconomic Climate: Global inflation rates, interest rate decisions by central banks, and geopolitical events can significantly impact investor appetite for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Landscape: Clarity or uncertainty around crypto regulations in major economies can either boost or dampen market sentiment. The progress of spot Ethereum ETFs, for instance, is a major positive catalyst. Technological Innovation: Continued advancements in blockchain technology, such as scalability solutions (Layer-2s), interoperability, and new decentralized applications (dApps), drive adoption and utility, underpinning long-term value. Liquidity: The overall amount of capital available in the market and its willingness to flow into riskier assets plays a huge role. For investors, this means keeping an eye not just on individual asset performance but also on the bigger picture. A robust Ethereum ecosystem, coupled with favorable macro conditions, creates a fertile ground for an altcoin resurgence. However, volatility remains a constant companion in this market. Actionable Insights for ETH Price Strength So, what should investors consider amidst these exciting predictions of ETH price strength and an impending altcoin season? While no financial advice can guarantee returns, here are some actionable insights to help you navigate this potentially lucrative period: Monitor ETH/BTC Ratio: This ratio is a primary indicator. A sustained upward trend signals Ethereum’s outperformance and often precedes broader altcoin rallies. Research Beyond the Top 10: Once ETH starts moving, capital often trickles down to mid and small-cap altcoins. Identify projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and real-world utility. Diversify Your Portfolio: While the allure of high returns from a single altcoin is strong, diversification across various promising projects can mitigate risk. Understand Risk Management: Altcoins are inherently more volatile than Bitcoin or Ethereum. Set clear profit targets and stop-loss levels. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Stay Informed: Follow reputable crypto analytics firms like Swissblock, news outlets, and on-chain data providers to stay abreast of market developments. Beware of FOMO: The fear of missing out can lead to irrational decisions. Stick to your research and investment strategy, even if others are boasting about quick gains. The potential for an Altcoin Season is exciting, but it’s essential to approach it with a well-thought-out strategy. Ethereum’s foundational role and its current display of strength are compelling reasons for optimism, but prudent decision-making is paramount. Conclusion: The Dawn of a New Era for Altcoins? The signals from Swissblock analysis regarding Ethereum’s sustained strength are certainly compelling. With increased inflows and consistent outperformance against Bitcoin, ETH is indeed showing all the classic signs of leading the charge into what could be a vibrant Altcoin Season . While the 72-hour window highlighted by Swissblock is a critical short-term indicator, the broader trends suggest a growing maturity and diversification within the crypto market . As ETH price strength continues to build, the stage appears set for a period where innovation and utility in the altcoin space could truly shine. Investors are encouraged to remain vigilant, conduct thorough research, and manage their risks wisely to potentially capitalize on this exciting phase.

2025-07-09T20:38:08,"Between Hype and Hardship: Pakistan’s Crypto Dilemma","Pakistan aspires to technological sovereignty. However, these ambitions face significant economic and political challenges, including low living standards and a protracted conflict with India, which controls the headwaters of key rivers. Coinpaper looked into how the Islamic republic, with great human potential, is trying to build a digital future amidst instability. First Steps Into the Digital Economy Pakistan, a country with a population of over 255 million people, is actively embracing digital technologies. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence. Young people, especially in big cities like Karachi and Lahore, are increasingly using blockchain applications and participating in cryptocurrency trading. It's not just a trend—for many, it's a way to protect themselves from financial instability. Above all, digital assets are an attractive tool for preserving and growing capital amid high inflation of the Pakistani rupee. For the young, technologically literate population, cryptocurrencies have also become a tool for cross-border transfers and earning money. However, not all Pakistanis can afford high-speed internet. According to projections for 2025, only 45.7% of the population has a stable connection, and rural areas are often left out of coverage altogether. This noticeably slows down the mass adoption of digital currencies. Cryptocurrency Paradox The situation with cryptocurrencies in Pakistan is a classic example of the conflict between the government and the population. Right now, digital assets are in a gray area. In 2022, Pakistani authorities considered banning cryptocurrencies and planned to block digital asset-related websites. At the same time, the State Bank announced the launch of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) by 2025. Despite this, the country has one of the highest adoption rates of digital assets in the world. Thanks to the activity of retail investors, Pakistan is among the top ten global leaders in adoption in 2024, according to data from Chainalysis. Analysts are also predicting further rapid growth, with the number of crypto users in the country expected to exceed 27 million by the end of 2025 and industry revenue expected to reach $1.6 billion. Dreams of Bitcoin Mining and State Reserves In 2021, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province announced plans to build state-owned farms to mine digital gold. The idea was to use cheap hydropower to replenish the treasury. The initiative stalled until 2025, when the head of the Cryptocurrency Board, Bilal bin Saqib, announced plans to divert surplus electricity to bitcoin mining and to power data centers for the artificial intelligence sector. It was later revealed to local media that the Pakistani government will allocate 2 GW for these purposes. The focus is on utilizing surplus resources from renewable sources—hydro, wind, and solar energy. This is an example of a balanced environmental agenda without Luddism: the country is not afraid of technology but seeks to minimize harm to nature. Soon after, Saqib announced the creation of a national reserve in digital gold. These intentions, as well as the country's other moves into cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence, caused concerns from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Pakistan has announced ambitious plans to utilize surplus renewable energy for mining and a bitcoin fund. However, the practical implementation of these initiatives requires a clear legal framework. At the moment, such a legal framework has not yet been developed in the country, which is the main obstacle on the way to the goal. Digital Silk Road Pakistan's technological leap would not have been possible without China. Beijing is Islamabad's main partner, and this cooperation goes far beyond politics. It is embedded in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) megaproject. Key areas of support: Infrastructure: Chinese companies are actively involved in laying fiber optic cables. One example is the PEACE (Pakistan & East Africa Connecting Europe) undersea cable project, which reduces Pakistan's dependence on existing communication lines and directly connects it to partner countries. Artificial intelligence and surveillance: China is helping to implement Safe City systems in Islamabad, Lahore, and other megacities. These are comprehensive platforms with thousands of cameras and AI algorithms for facial recognition and behavioral analysis. 5G connectivity: Chinese giants Huawei and ZTE are the main contractors in testing and deploying fifth-generation networks in Pakistan. For China, a technologically advanced and stable Pakistan is a security guarantee for its CPEC investment and a key node in the ”One Belt, One Road” initiative. Internet Under Control The World Wide Web in Pakistan is tightly regulated, but the methods are different from China's. While ”The Great Firewall of China” is a sophisticated, proactive content filtering system, Pakistan's approach is reactive and crude. The main regulator is the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA). Its toolkit includes: Platform blocking: Authorities have not hesitated to block access to YouTube, TikTok, Wikipedia, and most recently Social Network X at the national level. The blockages are spotty and temporary in nature. Shutdowns: During political protests or unrest, the government routinely shuts down mobile internet across the country or in specific regions. This is considered an effective measure to combat the coordination of protesters. Slowing down traffic (throttling): Reducing the speed of access to certain resources to make their use uncomfortable. Such techniques directly damage the digital economy, but authorities believe they are justified to maintain control. India's Water Leverage Pakistan's main vulnerability is access to water. The country is critically dependent on rivers originating in Indian territory or in Indian-controlled Kashmir. It is a legacy of the partition of British India that New Delhi uses as powerful leverage. The relationship is governed by the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960. According to it, Pakistan receives the flow of ”western” rivers (Indus, Jhelam, Chenab) and India receives the flow of ”eastern” rivers (Ravi, Beas, Sutlej). However, India has the right to build hydropower plants on ”Pakistani” rivers. Another escalation of the Kashmir conflict that began in April 2025 has once again highlighted this vulnerability. In response to the escalation, India restricted the flow of water in the Chenab and Jhelam rivers used by Pakistan for agriculture and power generation. Such actions allow India to exert direct economic pressure on its neighbors. In this context, technology development becomes a matter of survival. Artificial intelligence is already being used to optimize water consumption in agriculture, and the shift to alternative energy sources, including hydroelectric mining, is reducing the critical dependence on rivers controlled by India. Economic Realism and the Key to the Future To understand whether Pakistan's plans for digitalization and cryptocurrencies are realistic, it's worth looking at economic indicators. The average income in the country is $1,824 per year—an extremely low level by global standards. So buying, for example, mining equipment for the vast majority of Pakistanis remains an impossible task. This figure explains everything: why the population is fleeing to cryptocurrencies out of poverty, why the government cannot finance its own IT projects, and why the country is so heavily dependent on Chinese loans and technology. Talk of building sophisticated AI ecosystems or buying bitcoin for government reserves seems disconnected from reality, where basic needs for millions of people remain unmet. Pakistan is at a crossroads. On the one hand, there is huge human capital, interest in digital finance, and support from China. On the other, there is chaotic regulation, poverty, and constant conflicts with India. The country will have to find a balance between ambition and reality. If plans for a bitcoin reserve and mining come to fruition, it could set an example for other developing countries. But without addressing basic problems—from internet access to energy stability—such projects run the risk of remaining on paper. This path is fraught with risks, from digital authoritarianism to economic isolation in case of failure. But for the country, such a technological leap could be a chance for a better future.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9875/between-hype-and-hardship-pakistan-s-crypto-dilemma,"ASIA|FIAT|MINING|BTC|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-07-09T20:30:35,"SBI Group Unlocks Future: Seamless Crypto Redemption for Japanese Cardholders","Are you a Japanese credit card user dreaming of dipping your toes into the world of digital assets? The wait is over! In a groundbreaking move that signals a significant step towards mainstream Cryptocurrency Conversion , Japanese financial giant SBI Group’s APLUS is now allowing its cardholders to turn their accumulated loyalty points into actual crypto. This development is not just a convenience; it’s a powerful statement about the evolving landscape where traditional finance and digital currencies converge. SBI Group’s Bold Leap into Digital Assets The SBI Group , a colossal financial conglomerate with extensive interests ranging from banking to asset management and even biotechnology, has long been a pioneering force in embracing blockchain and digital assets. Their latest initiative through APLUS allows cardholders in Japan to seamlessly convert their loyalty points into popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP. This isn’t their first rodeo in the crypto space; SBI has been deeply involved with Ripple (XRP) for years and operates its own crypto exchange, VC Trade. This strategic move underscores SBI’s commitment to integrating digital assets into everyday financial activities. It positions them at the forefront of financial innovation, demonstrating how established institutions can adapt and thrive in the rapidly changing digital economy. By offering a direct pathway from conventional loyalty points to crypto, SBI is not just facilitating transactions; it’s educating a wider audience about the utility and accessibility of digital currencies. How Does Crypto Redemption Work for APLUS Cardholders? The process for Crypto Redemption through APLUS is designed to be straightforward and user-friendly, making it accessible even for those new to the crypto world. Here’s a breakdown of how it operates: Point Conversion: APLUS cardholders can redeem 2,100 loyalty points. Crypto Value: This converts to approximately ¥2,000 (about $13 USD) worth of cryptocurrency. Direct Deposit: The redeemed crypto – whether it’s Bitcoin, Ethereum, or XRP – is directly deposited into the user’s VC Trade account. VC Trade is SBI’s proprietary cryptocurrency exchange, ensuring a secure and integrated experience. Accessibility: This low entry barrier (a small amount of points for a small amount of crypto) makes it an ideal way for beginners to get started with crypto ownership without significant financial commitment. This initiative effectively bridges the gap between everyday consumer spending and the burgeoning digital asset market, transforming loyalty rewards from mere discounts into tangible digital investments. Boosting Japan Crypto Adoption: What This Means This development is a significant catalyst for Japan Crypto Adoption . Japan has always been a forward-thinking nation regarding technology and finance, and its regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is relatively clear compared to many other countries. By enabling millions of credit card users to easily acquire crypto, SBI Group is: Increasing Awareness: It brings cryptocurrencies into the daily conversations of ordinary consumers, demystifying them. Lowering Barriers to Entry: Many people are hesitant to buy crypto directly due to perceived complexity or risk. Converting existing loyalty points offers a risk-free, familiar entry point. Legitimizing Crypto: When a major financial institution like SBI Group endorses and integrates crypto, it adds a layer of legitimacy and trust for the general public. Driving Usage: As more people hold small amounts of crypto, they are more likely to explore its uses, potentially leading to increased trading or future spending. This move aligns with a broader global trend of integrating digital assets into traditional financial ecosystems, making Japan a key player in this evolution. The Rise of Loyalty Programs Crypto Integration The integration of crypto into Loyalty Programs Crypto is not an isolated incident. Across the globe, businesses are exploring innovative ways to leverage blockchain technology to enhance their reward systems. From airline miles to retail points, the traditional loyalty landscape is ripe for disruption. Companies are recognizing that offering crypto as a reward can: Increase Engagement: Crypto rewards often hold more perceived value and excitement than traditional discounts or gift cards. Attract New Demographics: It appeals to tech-savvy individuals and crypto enthusiasts. Enhance Utility: Unlike store-specific points, cryptocurrencies are liquid and can be traded or spent more broadly. Future-Proof Rewards: As digital economies grow, crypto rewards position companies for future payment trends. SBI’s APLUS program is a prime example of how traditional loyalty schemes can evolve to meet the demands of a digital-first generation, setting a precedent for other financial institutions and businesses worldwide. Seamless Cryptocurrency Conversion: Benefits and Future Outlook The ability to facilitate seamless Cryptocurrency Conversion from everyday loyalty points offers several compelling benefits for both consumers and the broader crypto market. For consumers, it’s an effortless way to gain exposure to digital assets without direct investment, fostering financial literacy in a new asset class. For the crypto market, it represents a significant step towards mass adoption, bringing new users and liquidity into the ecosystem. Looking ahead, this initiative could inspire other major financial institutions and loyalty program providers globally to follow suit. Imagine earning Bitcoin for your coffee purchases, or Ethereum for your grocery shopping! While the initial redemption amounts are modest, the symbolic importance of this move cannot be overstated. It signals a future where digital assets are not just an alternative investment but an integrated part of our daily financial lives. In conclusion, SBI Group’s APLUS program marks a pivotal moment in the convergence of traditional finance and the crypto world. By allowing Japanese credit card users to convert loyalty points into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP, SBI is not only enhancing customer value but also significantly contributing to Japan’s leadership in crypto adoption. This innovative step underscores a future where digital currencies are increasingly accessible and integrated into our everyday financial activities, paving the way for broader mainstream acceptance.

2025-07-09T20:10:00,"Ethereum's Steady Performance Sets The Stage For An Upside Breakout (Technical Analysis)","Summary The daily chart shows decent consolidation with two fakeouts. Buyers have stepped in consistently using the 50-Day moving average as support for continuous buying. A strong buying candle above the 2,750 range highs would be necessary to confirm the hypothesis. By Elior Manier The second largest cryptocurrency has been on a consistent grind in the past two weeks after seeing some heavy selling flows during the Israel-Iran War, taking its prices close to the $2,000 mark but since, has been posting a slow but strong rally, fuel for further continuation. Crypto markets haven't taken a significant direction for a while, but it doesn't mean that no opportunities are availables – Ranges give the opportunity for markets to cool down and prepare for further moves, while consolidating v olume-at-price. Market theory implies that the more prices are at an equilibrium (rangebound), the more solid the anchor of value for all participants. With cryptos consolidating at much higher levels than prior years, this shows a resilience for cryptocurrency markets and gives it more credibility for traditional investors to start inputting more flows. For example, since mid-May 2025, Bitcoin has been consolidating between $100,000 to $110,000 – despite giving to many players the opportunity to take their profits, markets did not retrace. Ranges also provide opportunities for scalpers who may attempt to trade highs and lows. Same for Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) which has been holding between $2,350 to $2,750 for close to two months now , and despite these prices being not too close from the Ether's ETH, it still consolidates at a relative high value, particularly after the 2025 Q1 Heavy Selling. Where does Ethereum stand after close to 2 months of consolidation? Ethereum Daily Chart Ethereum Daily Chart, July 9, 2025 – Source: TradingView The Daily chart shows decent consolidation with two fakeouts – it can happen that fakeouts lead to players being trapped beyond consolidation levels and create movements on the other side of the range. An upside fakeout in mid-June led to a retracement down to the $2,174 lows only a few days after. Since, however, buyers have stepped in consistently using the 50-Day Moving Average as support for continuous buying. With momentum not moving too fast to the upside (due to the speed and consistency of the buying move), the conditions for an upward breakout are starting to assemble . A strong buying candle above the 2,750 range highs would be necessary to confirm the hypothesis as a range is poised to hold as long as it holds before the inverse is proven true. Keep an eye on sentiment in other cryptos, particularly altcoins to spot how crypto players are moving. Ethereum 4H Chart Ethereum 4H Chart, July 9, 2025 – Source: TradingView The 4H Candles further give signs of the consistent grind, however it will be essential to spot how buyers react to the increasingly overbought conditions of the shorter timeframe. The 4H MA 50 is also accompanying the trend with a not-to-steep and stable trendline forming since the war-lows. Prices will have to hold above the $ 2,570 mid range level for a breakout to the upside above the $ 2,750 range highs – June fakeout highs are at $2,880 ETH-BTC check-up ETH outperforming Bitcoin is essential for other altcoins to keep growing, as was the case in past cycles, which would provide yet another sign of consistency for the cryptocurrency markets. After a downside fakeout, ETHBTC is getting back into its range but still has to overcome the 2.46% mid-range level before showing more bullish signs. Safe trades!

2025-07-09T20:07:23,"BREAKING: Bitcoin price hits record high as ETF demand overwhelms bearish market setup","Bitcoin has officially entered price discovery mode, breaking its May high as bearish indicators failed to contain ETF-led flows, growing corporate balance sheet adoption, and macro tailwinds. Traders who bet against the breakout are now fueling the rally’s next leg. On July 9, Bitcoin ( BTC ) surged over 2% to trade just above its prior all-time high of $111,970 set in May. The rally defied a wall of skepticism: short interest had climbed to $35 billion ahead of the move, while technical indicators flashed bearish divergences. Bitcoin’s all-time high could be seen as confirmation that institutional capital flows, not retail leverage, now dictate crypto’s inflection points. The original cryptocurrency entered into the uncharted territory amid a macro environment clouded by hawkish labor data and a sudden drop in rate-cut expectations, defying short-term bearish sentiment that had gripped markets earlier in the week. You might also like: Dow Jones eyes 45,000 level after strong jobs report Institutional tsunami, macro tailwinds defy bearish resistance Bitcoin’s breakout comes at a time when the traditional drivers of crypto rallies, such as halving narratives and speculative retail euphoria, have been sidelined by more durable capital flows. What appeared as counterintuitive price action, when BTC soared despite cooling rate-cut bets and rising short positions, reveals a fundamental market shift. The $35 billion in open short interest that accumulated ahead of the breakout became fuel for the rally, as ETF inflows and corporate buying created a supply squeeze that forced bears to cover positions. Data shows spot Bitcoin ETFs absorbed 245,000 BTC in Q2 alone, equivalent to nearly 1% of the total supply, while public companies beyond Strategy aggressively added billions in Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Standard Chartered analysts call this a “new flow regime,” where institutional absorption outpaces new supply from miners by a 3:1 margin. At the same time, broader risk markets have firmed around a surprisingly resilient U.S. economy. The June nonfarm payrolls report came in well above expectations, with 147,000 jobs added and the unemployment rate falling to 4.1%. That data prompted a sharp repricing in interest rate expectations. CME FedWatch now shows just a 5% chance of a July cut, down from 24% earlier this week. While tighter policy would typically pressure risk assets, Bitcoin’s rise alongside equities suggests it’s being repriced less as a high-beta asset and more as a liquidity magnet in a capital-constrained world. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also gained on Wednesday, with the Dow adding 164 points, or 0.4%. Favorable geopolitics? Geopolitics added unexpected tailwinds. On July 9, the Trump administration fired warning shots at six nations, slapping Algeria and Iraq with 30% tariffs, while Brunei, Libya, and Moldova face 25% duties, and the Philippines braces for 20%. This marks the latest escalation in a broader tariff offensive, following threats against Japan and South Korea earlier in the week. Historically, such measures trigger inflation, supply chain disruptions, and equity sell-offs. But Bitcoin’s eerie calm suggests traders aren’t panicking, at least not yet. According to CoinShares’ James Butterfill, that may be a temporary illusion. “In the short term, tariffs slow growth and spook risk assets, including Bitcoin,” he noted in a report earlier this year. Nansen’s Nicolai Sondergaard cautions against overreading the frenzy. “Increased tariff announcements will likely spook the market,” he told crypto.news, “but players are conditioned to expect last-minute deals.” The real test comes August 1, and if tariffs take effect, Bitcoin’s rangebound complacency could shatter.

Many altcoins mimicked BTC’s rally, which resulted in roughly $500 million worth of liquidations on a 24-hour scale across the market. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView After the peak reached on Bitcoin Pizza Day (May 22), the primary cryptocurrency started to lose some ground, which culminated precisely a month later with a price dump to $98,000 during the Iran-Israel war. However, the bulls managed to contain the losses, and BTC quickly topped $100,000. In fact, the asset hasn’t traded within a five-digit price territory in over two weeks. July started with a slight stagnation, though, as bitcoin remained stuck between $105,000 and $110,000. However, the cryptocurrency went on the offensive hard in the past few hours, breaking above the upper boundary and surging to a fresh all-time high at exactly $112,000 (on Bitstamp and many other exchanges) minutes ago. Among the possible reasons behind today’s surge came a few hours ago when US President Trump urged the Federal Reserve to cut the rates by 300bps. Such a potential historic move is expected to benefit riskier assets like BTC and crypto. Many altcoins have followed suit on the way north, charting gains of close to 10%. ETH, for example, has risen by more than 6% since this time yesterday and trades close to $2,800. This volatility has harmed over-leveraged traders, resulting in more than $480 million in daily liquidations. The number of wrecked traders sits at 100,000, according to CoinGlass, most of which were from shorts. One particular position stands out as the single-largest liquidation; it happened on HTX and was worth over $51 million. Liquidation Heat Map.

2025-07-09T20:00:16,"Capital Clearly Coming to Ethereum Amid Changing Narrative for ETH, Says Crypto Strategist – Here’s His Upside Price Target","An analyst known for making timely crypto calls believes that Ethereum ( ETH ) is poised to positively surprise investors. Pseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 869,800 followers on the social media platform X that he’s targeting $3,200 for Ethereum but notes that ETH can print new all-time high prices. Pentoshi says the macro picture is changing for Ethereum in a meaningful way. “You can see the narrative changing around ETH right now. And in my opinion, it will be obvious in hindsight. But most are too jaded. In less than one month, public companies will have bought enough ETH to offset all the ETH that’s been created since the Merge. It’s 1/9th the market cap of BTC, and takes far less capital to move. That capital is clearly coming. It’s still very early for this trade. I don’t know if it will be today, tomorrow, or next month. But I think we are going to look back at what is right in front of your eyes and think, I can’t believe it was so obvious. The amount of capital starting to flow into ETH, will lead to big moves. And all we have to do, is do nothing. Set the tribalism aside, set the past aside. [Tom Lee] should be paid attention to, and the amount of companies he will onboard, and other retail users. All you have to do is set your bias aside and look at what’s happening. Hate it or love it. It seems inevitable.” In a question-and-answer exclusive with the Global Money Talk YouTube channel, Fundstrat managing partner Tom Lee says that Ethereum will come back to life amid increasing stablecoin adoption. “Stablecoins are being pushed by the United States government. Here’s the thing. Circle (USDC) runs on Ethereum. Stablecoins run on Ethereum. So as stablecoins explode, Ethereum is the backbone for stablecoins. So I think Ethereum is going to make a big comeback as well.” Data from DefiLlama shows that the total Ethereum stablecoins market cap currently stands at $126.509 billion, up over $431 million in just seven days. At time of writing, ETH is worth $2,615.

2025-07-09T20:00:10,"XRP Price Flashes Bullish Continuation Signals — Why A Surge Above $3 Is Possible","The XRP price is once again capturing the attention of the market as it reclaims critical support levels and flashes a textbook breakout structure. With momentum building and bullish continuation signals aligning, analysts say the groundwork may be in place for a powerful Wave 3 surge —one that could send XRP soaring beyond the $3 mark. XRP Price Eyes Explosive Wave 3 Rally In a rather detailed X (formerly Twitter) post on July 7, CasiTrades, a prominent crypto analyst and trader, shared new insights on XRP’s future price movements , predicting its next breakout formation and highlighting the potential for a powerful Wave 3 rally. The analyst stated that XRP is currently flashing strong bullish continuation signals , as recent price action aligns with classic technical patterns, suggesting a major breakout above $3 may be near. Looking at CasiTrade’s chart analysis, it appears that XRP has completed a textbook consolidation phase and has now reclaimed the critical $2.25 level, which served as the apex of the multi-month Symmetrical Triangle structure . Notably, the reclaim came after a brief fake-out to the downside. The $2.25 level also aligns with the 0.382 Fibonacci Retracement, marking it as a key macro resistance zone that turned support. Currently trading just above $2.3, CasiTrades revealed that XRP is testing local resistance. She noted that a confirmed breakout above this area could open the path to higher Fibonacci targets of $2.69 and $3.04. These levels also correspond to the 1.618 and higher macro Fibonacci Extensions from the previous rally wave. CasiTrades also highlights that XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is trending upward and remains below overbought zones, supporting continued upward momentum. She further notes that XRP is building this powerful breakout setup independently, without any bullish trigger from Bitcoin (BTC) or a major news catalyst. Moreover, XRP’s projected move has been identified as Wave 3 of 3 in the Elliott Wave Theory . While the exact top of this wave setup is yet to be determined, CasiTrades confirms that the breakout itself could define the structure of Wave 3, allowing for a more precise projection of bullish targets as the rally unfolds. Wave 4 Correction To Trigger 40% Breakdown Following XRP’s anticipated bullish breakout and the completion of its projected Wave 3 peak, CasiTrades predicts that the cryptocurrency could soon enter a significant corrective phase in the form of Wave 4 . This price correction is expected to retrace approximately 40% from the breakout high, depending on where Wave 3 tops out. The analyst pointed to a possible timeline for the Wave 3 peak, noting a key Fibonacci convergence expected in late July that could not only mark the top but also the potential start of the Wave 4 decline. For instance, CasiTrades notes that if XRP extends to a $6.5 target, the resulting pullback would likely lead to a retest toward the current all-time high near $3.84.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-flashes-bullish-continuation/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","XRP|CasiTrades|elliott wave theory|Fibonacci Convergence|relative strength index|RSI|Symmetrical Triangle Structure|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare

The move came amid a broader crypto rally that also saw Ethereum's ether (ETH) surge 6% to $2,760, its highest level in a month. Bitcoin itself was ahead 2.4% at $111,400 at press time. For BTC, the $110,000 level has been a significant barrier over the past weeks with investors taking profits each time the price neared that level. Checking crypto-related stocks, Strategy (MSTR) is higher by 4.4% and at $414 only a few dollars shy of its highest level of 2025 (though still well below its record high set late last year of $543). Coinbase (COIN) is ahead 5%. Bitcoin miners MARA Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) are up roughly 6%. Still, market watchers noted that the slow, quiet buildup could be a bullish setup.

2025-07-09T19:36:05,"Russian businesses to be fined for crypto payroll","Russian companies that have been tempted to pay employees in cryptocurrency are likely to be hit with hefty fines, according to labor authorities in Moscow. Crypto has been gaining traction as a means of remuneration since Russia permitted limited use of cryptocurrencies in cross-border transactions, but regulators are adamant that the ruble remains the only legal tender, including when it comes to wages. Russia’s labor agency threatens fines for crypto salaries Russian businesses are not allowed to pay salaries in cryptocurrency, fully or partially, according to Russia’s State Labor Inspectorate. The agency outlined its categorical stance in a response to a request from employers for clarification on the matter, the Russian daily Izvestia unveiled this week. The inspectorate’s position has been confirmed by the Ministry of Labor, the publication added. According to the country’s Labor Code, salaries can be paid exclusively with money, and cryptocurrency has so far been recognized only as property in Russia, the article explained. Using digital coins for payroll purposes has become relevant since the Russian government legalized crypto settlements in foreign trade to help companies deal with financial restrictions imposed over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Since 2024, legal entities have been permitted to make international payments in crypto through state-authorized platforms and strictly within an “experimental legal regime” (ELR). The arrangement has tempted some employers to pay wages this way as well. Questions regarding the option also arise from the convenience of cross-border crypto transfers that are fast and low-cost. That makes them attractive for Russian firms working with foreign specialists, explained Alexander Khaminsky from the industry organization Business Russia. However, using anything other than the ruble as a means of payment, outside the ELR, is still against the law in Russia. And no exception has been made so far that would allow salaries to be legally paid in digital assets, noted Maxim Barashev, managing partner at the BBNP law firm. According to Khaminsky, all this leads to the following conclusion: “Payments in crypto carry legal risks for the employer.” At present, fines for such offenses are relatively small, 50,000 rubles at the most (a little over $600). But at the same time, the Russian parliament is now considering a bill that seeks to raise the monetary penalty for illegal payments with crypto to 1 million rubles (almost $13,000). Russian companies want to pay crypto wages, Moscow says ‘No’ Interest in crypto payments for remuneration, as an alternative to bank wires of fiat, has been growing around the world, not least due to the increasing number of remote jobs. Traditional channels can be slow and costly, slashing up to 6% of the payroll. In the case of Russia, international sanctions are also a major concern. Euro and dollar transactions may not go through at all, commented Victoria Pavlyushina, partner at the Russian Agency for Economy Transformation and Development. Introducing cryptocurrencies into the Russian economy is “inevitable,” according to Damir Kudryakov, an expert at the Faculty of Economics of the RUDN University. Companies nowadays are increasingly looking for alternatives to the classic banking tools, he added. The authorities in Moscow fear, however, that besides undermining Russia’s national currency and its most modern incarnation, the digital ruble , cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) can also allow businesses and employees to “optimize” their tax expenses and prevent regulators from tracking financial flows. Pavlyushina pointed out: “A mass transition to it [crypto] threatens loss of personal income tax and insurance premiums, as well as a decrease in the role of the ruble.” “We continue to be against using cryptocurrencies in payments inside the country. That is, ‘yes’ for foreign economic activity, ‘yes’ for particularly qualified investors as a target for investments. Nevertheless, we are against their use as a means of payment,” Russia’s central bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina was recently quoted as stating. Elsewhere, crypto salaries have already become a viable option for employers and employees alike in a number of countries, Izvestia noted in its article , giving the United States, Japan, Switzerland, and Portugal as examples.

On Wednesday, the company disclosed in a public filing that Donald picked up 350,000 shares, making him one of the largest shareholders. The deal was made based on advice from his investment manager, and Donald will not be playing any operational role at the firm. This new stake follows a $6 million private placement of convertible preferred stock organized last week by Dominari Securities, an investment bank where both Donald and his brother Eric Trump serve as advisers to the parent company. The stock closed at $12.36 per share on Tuesday but had dropped 17% by midday Wednesday after a recent run-up of 75% over four sessions as of press time. Despite the volatility, Donny went ahead with the purchase. Company loses money, stacks Bitcoin, and adds six more coins Thumzup runs an app that pays users to post brand promotions on Instagram, but it isn’t bringing in much cash. The company brought in just $151 in revenue during the first quarter of the year, while spending $2.2 million. As losses grow, the company’s response has been to stockpile crypto. In January, Thumzup said it would park most of its liquid assets in Bitcoin , and by now it has more than $2 million worth. Today, the firm said it’s expanding that strategy to include six additional coins, using proceeds from the private placement to do so. None of the companies or individuals involved gave public comments. A spokesperson for the Trump Organization, where Donny serves as Executive Vice President, didn’t respond to messages. Thumzup and Dominari both declined to comment as well. Meanwhile, more Trump-aligned businesses are heading in the same direction. Dominari began investing in a Bitcoin ETF in February. In March, Eric joined the board of advisers at Metaplanet, a former hotel company in Japan that now focuses on buying up Bitcoin. And the Trump Media & Technology Group, which runs Truth Social, raised $2.3 billion for Bitcoin investments. President Donald Trump, now back in the White House, has publicly vowed to make the United States the “crypto capital of the world.” His wealth, estimated at $6.5 billion by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has been boosted by the family’s crypto-heavy ventures like World Liberty Financial and the Trump memecoin.

Under the House bill, a publicly-traded company like Meta or Tesla could simply decide to put its stock on the blockchain and POOF! it would escape all SEC regulation.” This simply means that if these companies decided to turn their stocks into a crypto token and put it on blockchain under the CLARITY bill, it might no longer be subject to the SEC regulation like financial disclosures and investor protection. This could create a loophole that allows big companies to evade financial regulations by calling their stocks or assets “crypto tokens.” Shut down the superhighway for presidential corruption Warren has accused Trump of using his position to make billionaires richer. She asked Congress to shut down the president’s crypto corruption. This means prohibiting public officials, including the president, from issuing, sponsoring, or profiting from crypto tokens. She said that Trump has already benefited from issuing his stablecoin, his memecoin, owning a Bitcoin mining company, and controlling a huge portfolio of crypto investments. According to reports, the President and his associates pocketed more than $320 million alone from the $TRUMP memecoin , while most retail investors who bought that token lost money. Also, Bloomberg reported that Trump had added at least $620 million to his portfolio in a matter of months due to his crypto investments. Lummis said, “ If we’re going to provide rules of the road for crypto, we need to shut down this superhighway for presidential corruption at the same time.” Lummis asks for equal protection from scammers Crypto investors should have the same protections from getting scammed or cheated as investors in any other asset. According to Warren, the protection shouldn’t be bigger, but it should be the same. She gave an example of the rules prohibiting stock exchanges from simultaneously serving as brokers and giving preferential treatment to their own trades over their customers’ should be applied to the crypto market. She also said that the law should ensure that turmoil in the crypto market doesn’t infect the traditional financial system. That means making sure that taxpayers are not on the hook for backstopping risky crypto bets. There should be strong capital, liquidity, and risk management safeguards for crypto exchanges, crypto dealers, and other middle-market players so they can meet their obligations to customers and counterparties even when the market is unstable. In addition, she asked that the law should counter the threat of illicit finance with commonsense rules to fight crime and protect our national security. Crypto service providers that act as financial institutions must be required to implement anti-money laundering programs. She highlighted figures from the FBI that say that Americans lost more than $9 billion to crypto fraud last year. It was a 66% increase from the year prior. She said, “Republicans refused to strengthen AML rules and close sanctions loopholes in the GENIUS Act and said they’d deal with it in a crypto market structure bill. So this is it. No more kicking the can down the road. Now is the time to solve that problem.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/clarity-bill-gives-tesla-meta-sec-loophole/,"REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC","News|Regulation|Meta|Tesla",cryptocompare
2025-07-09T19:06:38,"Cathie Wood's ARK: Bitcoin's Bullish Momentum Slows as Long-Term Holder Stacks Hit Record","Bitcoin's price saw a modest 2.55% increase in June, failing to surpass its May peak of $112,000. The cryptocurrency continues to trade within a narrow range, reflecting a period of consolidation, according to ARK Invest's latest Bitcoin Monthly report . A significant development highlighted in the report is the rise in long-term holders (LTHs), who now possess 74% of the total bitcoin supply — a level not seen in 15 years. This suggests a strong conviction among seasoned investors, even as the influx of new buyers diminishes. However, the report also points to a decline in on-chain capital flows during the second quarter, as measured by the Market-Value-to-Realized-Value (MVRV) momentum metric. This downturn indicates a cooling in market enthusiasm and a potential shift in investor sentiment. In the broader economic context, the U.S. dollar (as measured by the Fed’s Nominal Broad Trade Weighted Dollar Index) keeps climbing, defying the dominant narrative of dollar debasement that has fueled long-term bullish sentiment in crypto. Meanwhile, inflation showed continued signs of easing, raising questions about bitcoin’s traditional appeal as an inflation hedge — though, on the flip side, lower inflation may also lead to lower federal funding rates, something that tends to boost risk-on assets like tech stocks and cryptocurrencies. Housing appears to be a weak link, the report noted, highlighting a growing gap between elevated homeowner expectations and a sharp drop in home sales. This divergence hints at potential strain in consumer confidence and broader economic activity.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/09/cathie-woods-ark-bitcoins-bullish-momentum-slows-as-long-term-holder-stacks-hit-record,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT","Markets|ARK Invest|Bitcoin|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-09T19:00:34,"Binance Proof of Reserves: Unveiling Crucial Shifts in BTC and ETH Holdings","In the dynamic and often unpredictable world of cryptocurrencies, trust is the ultimate currency. For millions of users worldwide, knowing that their digital assets are secure and verifiable is paramount. This is precisely why initiatives like Proof of Reserves (POR) have become a cornerstone for major exchanges. Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally, consistently publishes its Proof of Reserves reports, offering a crucial glimpse into its financial health and the composition of its user funds. Their latest report, based on a July 1 snapshot, has unveiled some fascinating and perhaps unexpected shifts in asset distribution, particularly concerning BTC holdings , ETH holdings , and a notable increase in USDT holdings . What do these changes truly signify for the broader market and for your crypto portfolio? Understanding Binance Proof of Reserves: A Cornerstone of Trust Before we dive into the specifics of the latest report, it’s essential to grasp what a Proof of Reserves report entails and why it’s so vital in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. In essence, a Proof of Reserves is an independent audit that verifies a cryptocurrency exchange holds the assets it claims to on behalf of its users. This process typically involves cryptographic proofs, like Merkle Trees, to allow individual users to verify their own funds are included in the total reserves without revealing their personal information. The importance of POR was starkly highlighted in the wake of significant industry events, particularly the collapse of FTX. These incidents underscored the critical need for exchanges to demonstrate solvency and transparency. By regularly publishing these reports, Binance aims to foster greater confidence among its user base, showing that customer funds are indeed backed 1:1 and are not being used for undisclosed purposes. It’s a proactive step towards building a more transparent and accountable financial system, setting a benchmark for crypto transparency across the industry. Crucial Shifts: Diving Deep into Binance’s BTC Holdings and ETH Holdings The 32nd Proof of Reserves report from Binance, based on a snapshot taken on July 1, provides a detailed look at the exchange’s reserves. The figures, as reported by Wu Blockchain on X, indicate a noticeable recalibration of assets held on the platform. Let’s break down the key changes: Bitcoin (BTC) Holdings: User BTC holdings stood at 573,000. This represents a decline of 3.27% compared to the figures from June. Ethereum (ETH) Holdings: User ETH holdings also saw a decrease, falling by 5.34% to 5.051 million. These declines in two of the largest and most prominent cryptocurrencies on the platform raise important questions. What factors could be contributing to this shift? Several possibilities come to mind: User Withdrawals and Self-Custody: A common trend in the crypto space, especially after market turbulence, is for users to move their assets off exchanges and into self-custody solutions (like hardware wallets). This is often driven by a desire for greater control and security, aligning with the core ethos of decentralization. Market Volatility and De-risking: The crypto market is known for its volatility. Users might be reducing their exposure to more volatile assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, opting to hold less on exchanges or rebalancing their portfolios in response to market conditions. Profit-Taking or Reallocation: Users might be selling off portions of their BTC and ETH holdings, either to realize profits or to reallocate funds into other assets or investment opportunities outside of the Binance ecosystem. It’s important to note that a decline in exchange BTC holdings or ETH holdings doesn’t necessarily indicate a lack of confidence in the assets themselves, but rather a shift in where users prefer to hold them or how they are managing their risk exposure. The Rising Tide: Exploring the Implications of Increased USDT Holdings While Bitcoin and Ethereum saw declines, the report highlighted a significant increase in Tether (USDT) holdings: Tether (USDT) Holdings: User USDT holdings rose by 2.64% to an impressive 29.59 billion. This increase in stablecoin holdings is particularly noteworthy and can be interpreted in several ways, each shedding light on current market sentiment and user behavior: Flight to Safety: During periods of market uncertainty or volatility, stablecoins like USDT often serve as a safe haven. Users might be converting their more volatile assets into stablecoins to preserve capital, effectively waiting out potential downturns without exiting the crypto market entirely. Preparation for Trading Opportunities: An increase in stablecoin reserves on an exchange can also indicate that users are positioning themselves for future trading opportunities. Having readily available USDT allows traders to quickly enter new positions when they identify favorable market conditions or dips in asset prices. Increased Trading Activity: USDT is a primary trading pair for a vast number of cryptocurrencies. Higher USDT holdings on the exchange could also reflect an increase in overall trading activity or liquidity being held for various trading strategies. Yield Opportunities: Some users might be holding USDT on the exchange to participate in staking, lending, or other yield-generating opportunities offered by Binance or integrated DeFi protocols. The rise in USDT holdings suggests a strategic decision by users to maintain liquidity and stability within the exchange environment, whether for defensive purposes or to capitalize on future market movements. Why Crypto Transparency Matters: Beyond Just Numbers The significance of Binance’s Proof of Reserves reports extends far beyond just the fluctuating numbers of specific cryptocurrencies. These reports are foundational to building trust and legitimacy in the nascent crypto industry. Here’s why crypto transparency is more critical than ever: Restoring Confidence: In an industry that has faced its share of scandals and collapses, transparent reporting helps restore and maintain user confidence. It assures users that their funds are not being mismanaged or used for undisclosed purposes. Reducing Systemic Risk: By regularly verifying reserves, exchanges contribute to reducing systemic risk within the broader crypto ecosystem. It prevents situations where exchanges operate with fractional reserves, which can lead to widespread financial instability. Setting Industry Standards: Major exchanges like Binance, by committing to regular POR, set a precedent for others in the industry. This encourages a culture of accountability and pushes for higher operational standards across the board. Regulatory Acceptance: As regulators worldwide grapple with how to oversee the crypto space, transparent reporting mechanisms like POR can play a crucial role. They provide regulators with verifiable data, potentially paving the way for more favorable regulatory frameworks and mainstream adoption. Empowering Users: Ultimately, transparency empowers users. It gives them the information needed to make informed decisions about where to store their assets and which platforms to trust. These reports are not just compliance checkboxes; they are vital tools for fostering a healthy, sustainable, and trustworthy digital asset economy. Navigating the Nuances: Challenges and What These Binance Proof of Reserves Reports Don’t Tell Us While Proof of Reserves reports are a monumental step forward for crypto transparency , it’s also important to approach them with a nuanced understanding of their limitations. No single report can paint a complete picture, and there are aspects that these snapshots typically don’t fully address: Snapshot in Time: A POR report is just that—a snapshot. It reflects the exchange’s reserves at a specific moment. The composition of assets can change rapidly, sometimes within hours or minutes, due to high trading volumes and user activity. It doesn’t provide a real-time, continuous audit. Liabilities Side: While POR verifies the assets held by the exchange, it often provides less detail about the exchange’s liabilities (what it owes to users). A true, comprehensive audit would involve both proof of assets and proof of liabilities to ensure full solvency. Exchanges like Binance have made strides in this area by integrating Merkle Tree proofs for user verification, but the full picture of liabilities can still be complex. Off-Chain Assets: POR typically focuses on on-chain assets. However, exchanges may hold some assets in off-chain or cold storage solutions, which are harder to verify cryptographically in a public report. Scope of Assets: Not all assets listed on an exchange may be included in the POR. While major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins are usually covered, smaller altcoins might not always be. Reliance on Auditor: While the process involves cryptographic verification, there’s still an element of trust placed in the third-party auditor or the exchange’s internal processes for generating and presenting the data. Understanding these limitations is crucial for users to maintain a healthy skepticism and to complement their reliance on POR with other due diligence practices. Actionable Insights for Users: What to Do with This Information? So, what should you, as a cryptocurrency user, take away from Binance’s latest Proof of Reserves report and the broader discussion around crypto transparency ? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Regularly review POR reports from exchanges you use. While they are snapshots, consistent positive reports over time can build confidence. Pay attention to trends in BTC holdings , ETH holdings , and USDT holdings . Consider Self-Custody: For long-term holdings, especially significant amounts, consider moving your assets to a hardware wallet or other self-custody solutions. This gives you direct control over your private keys, reducing reliance on any third-party exchange. Diversify Your Holdings: The shifts seen in Binance’s report underscore the dynamic nature of crypto assets. Diversifying your portfolio across different assets and potentially different trusted platforms can mitigate risk. Understand Market Sentiment: Changes in exchange holdings can be a good indicator of broader market sentiment. An increase in stablecoins, for instance, might suggest caution among traders, while an increase in volatile assets could signal growing bullishness. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never solely rely on a single report or news piece. Combine information from POR reports with broader market analysis, news from reputable sources, and your own risk assessment before making financial decisions. The Future of Trust: What’s Next for Crypto Transparency? Binance’s consistent efforts with its Proof of Reserves reports represent a significant step in the ongoing journey towards greater crypto transparency . The latest report, revealing a fascinating redistribution of BTC holdings , ETH holdings , and a surge in USDT holdings , offers valuable insights into user behavior and market dynamics. As the industry matures, we can expect to see further innovations in transparency and auditing methods. The goal is to move towards real-time, comprehensive, and fully verifiable systems that leave no room for doubt regarding the solvency and integrity of crypto exchanges. Binance, by continuing to publish these crucial reports, plays a pivotal role in setting the standard and guiding the industry towards a more trustworthy and resilient future. A Vital Snapshot: Summarizing Binance’s Asset Evolution In conclusion, Binance’s 32nd Proof of Reserves report offers a compelling snapshot of evolving asset preferences and market sentiment within its user base. The decline in BTC holdings and ETH holdings , juxtaposed with the rise in USDT holdings , paints a picture of users potentially de-risking, seeking stability, or positioning for future opportunities. This report not only reinforces Binance’s commitment to transparency but also provides valuable data for anyone navigating the complex crypto landscape. As the industry continues to mature, such detailed insights into exchange reserves will remain indispensable for fostering trust and empowering informed decisions.

Unlike the previous similar occasions, though, he was rather radical this time, claiming that the Federal Reserve needs to slash the rates by at least three points. First, President Trump mentions that higher rates are costing the US more money on interest expense. At a high level, this is true. Annual interest expense on US debt has reached $1.2 TRILLION over the last 12 months. The US is now paying $3.3 BILLION in interest per day. pic.twitter.com/22N9M2PdFX — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) July 9, 2025 According to the Kobeissi Letter, the US now pays well over $3 billion in interest alone per day. If Trump’s recommendation is followed by the Fed, then, he said, it would save $360 billion per year. However, the analysts at Kobeissi said the only debt that matters is the public one, which is at around $29 billion. Their analysis claims that if the rates on that entire amount are cut by 300 bps, the “US could save $290B x 3 = $870B/year.” “However, refinancing all of this debt immediately would be impossible. Realistically, 20% could be refinanced in year 1 to save ~$174B.” Although these numbers sound promising, there are certain drawbacks to such a potential rate cut, especially when it comes to inflation. It would be three times bigger than the current record seen in March 2020, when the Fed reduced the rates by 100bps. This would come with a US economy that is already growing at +3.8% YoY. As a result, we would expect to see a resurgence in CPI inflation, likely exceeding 5%. And, while it would initially send stocks higher as seen in March 2020, there’s no such thing as “free money.” pic.twitter.com/K5vRmp8Ay8 — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) July 9, 2025 The Kobeissi Letter further warned that mortgage rates would drop from 7% to 4% into a market that “has already seen prices rise +50% since 2020.” The analysts suggested that prices can surge by another 25%. Nevertheless, such a move should be highly beneficial for riskier assets like bitcoin. The cryptocurrency’s price is up by around 1% in the past day, and since Trump’s recommendation, it now stands close to $110,000. BTCUSD.

2025-07-09T18:43:08,"Why Are Bitcoin and Altcoins No Longer Responding to Donald Trump’s Tariff Threats? Here Are Expert Opinions","While Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP and Solana finished the day with slight increases today, the US's renegotiation with some of its foreign trade partners did not affect the crypto market much. However, according to analysts, despite these positive developments, cryptocurrencies are still stuck in a narrow price range. Bitcoin, for example, has traded largely between $107,000 and $110,000 in recent weeks. It’s up only 1.5% in the last 30 days, but it’s still close to its all-time high. Ethereum has been trading sideways at $2,500 for about a month, while Solana has also been stable around $150. The decline in cryptocurrencies following the “retaliatory tariffs” announced by US President Donald Trump in April contrasts with the recent stability. Some investors are struggling to understand why the market remains resilient despite Trump’s latest tariff threats. But analysts say this is not surprising. Experts say investors are less responsive to the US’s three-time postponement of negotiation deadlines and are more inclined to position themselves against macroeconomic uncertainty, allowing crypto assets to remain elevated despite the uncertainty. Related News: The Founder's Past Posts Have Surfaced in a Widely-Discussed Altcoin: Causing a Major Debate Trump sent official letters on Monday to 14 countries, including Japan, South Korea and Thailand, warning them that he would impose aggressive tariffs. The tariffs, ranging from 25% to 40%, are expected to go into effect on August 1. However, a possible delay is also on the agenda. Options analyst Bret Kenwell said investors believe Trump will delay the Aug. 1 tax cuts, which has even become the subject of a memecoin called “Trump Always Chickens Out.” “If there is confidence that negotiations will continue or the deadline will be extended, the market may continue to ignore such headlines,” Kenwell said. He also noted that any pullbacks would be viewed as buying opportunities for investors, which could pull prices back into the current range. Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said investors have become accustomed to Trump’s volatile trade negotiations and are now more resilient to such macro developments. Magadini also noted that institutional investors have been hedging their exposure to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) over the past seven months with options trading. Under this strategy, investors buy into the IBIT ETF, sell call options on it to generate income, and buy protective put options to reduce risk. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-09T18:10:34,"Bitcoin Whales Unleash Accumulation: A Critical Divide in Investor Confidence","Ever wondered what the true pulse of the Bitcoin market is? While headlines often focus on price fluctuations, the real story often unfolds behind the scenes, within the blockchain itself. Recent insights from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode reveal a fascinating and critical divergence in investor behavior: Bitcoin whales are quietly accumulating, while many smaller retail holders appear to be selling off their holdings. This stark contrast paints a vivid picture of current market sentiment and raises important questions about confidence levels across different investor tiers. Let’s dive deep into what this on-chain data signifies for the future of Bitcoin. Decoding the Behavior of Bitcoin Whales When we talk about Bitcoin whales , we’re referring to entities holding substantial amounts of BTC – typically 1,000 to 10,000 BTC, and sometimes even more. These are often institutional investors, high-net-worth individuals, or long-term holders with deep pockets and a long-term vision. According to Glassnode’s recent observations shared on X, these large players have been steadily increasing their Bitcoin stash. This isn’t just a random fluctuation; it’s a consistent pattern of accumulation, suggesting a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s future value, even amidst price volatility. What drives this behavior? Whales often have access to sophisticated market analysis, a higher risk tolerance, and the ability to ride out short-term downturns, viewing them as opportunities to buy at a discount. Their accumulation patterns are often seen as a bullish signal. If those with the most capital are buying, it implies they foresee significant upside potential. This isn’t to say their actions are infallible, but they certainly carry weight in the market narrative. It suggests a strategic play, possibly anticipating future demand, broader institutional adoption, or a long-term appreciation in Bitcoin’s value as a digital store of value. Why Are Retail Holders Selling Their Bitcoin? On the flip side, Glassnode’s data points to a different trend among smaller investors, specifically those holding between 1 and 10 BTC, often categorized as retail holders . These groups have shown a tendency to sell off their Bitcoin. This behavior could stem from several factors. For many retail investors, short-term price movements can trigger emotional responses. A dip in price might lead to panic selling, or perhaps they’re taking profits after a recent rally, aiming to de-risk or reallocate funds. Economic pressures, such as inflation or rising interest rates, might also compel some to liquidate assets to meet immediate financial needs. Another perspective is that some retail holders might be moving their assets off exchanges, or consolidating them into fewer wallets, which could appear as ‘selling’ from a specific wallet group’s perspective, though Glassnode’s methodology usually accounts for such movements. However, the prevailing interpretation points to a genuine reduction in holdings for this segment. This contrast in behavior highlights a clear divergence in confidence and strategy between the seasoned, deep-pocketed investors and the broader individual investor base. What Does This Market Sentiment Divide Imply? The stark difference in behavior between Bitcoin whales and retail holders provides crucial insights into current market sentiment . When whales accumulate, it often indicates a long-term bullish outlook. They are “buying the dip” or simply adding to their positions, confident that Bitcoin’s value will increase over time. Their actions can act as a stabilizing force, absorbing selling pressure from smaller investors. Conversely, the selling by retail holders can reflect a more cautious, fearful, or short-term opportunistic mindset. It might signal a lack of conviction, a need for liquidity, or simply a reaction to FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) in the market. This divide suggests that while the foundational belief in Bitcoin’s long-term potential remains strong among large entities, there’s a degree of uncertainty or short-term profit-taking occurring among smaller participants. Understanding this dynamic is key for anyone trying to gauge the underlying health and direction of the cryptocurrency market. Leveraging On-Chain Data for Informed Decisions This is where the power of on-chain data comes into play. Firms like Glassnode analyze publicly available information on the blockchain – every transaction, every wallet balance, every movement of coins. By aggregating and interpreting this data, they can identify patterns and trends that are invisible through traditional market analysis methods, which often focus solely on price and volume from exchanges. On-chain metrics provide a unique “x-ray vision” into the fundamental supply and demand dynamics of Bitcoin. They allow us to see not just what is being traded, but who is trading it, and in what quantities. For investors, this means gaining a deeper understanding of genuine accumulation or distribution phases. Instead of relying purely on news headlines or price charts, on-chain data offers a more robust, transparent, and often less emotional perspective on investor conviction. It helps distinguish between short-term noise and long-term structural shifts in market behavior. Identifying Accumulation Zones: On-chain data can help pinpoint periods where large entities are actively buying. Gauging Investor Confidence: By observing the net flow of coins into or out of different wallet sizes, one can infer the overall sentiment of various investor groups. Spotting Supply Shocks: Understanding how much Bitcoin is being held in long-term wallets versus short-term trading wallets can indicate potential supply shortages or gluts. Navigating the Challenges of On-Chain Analysis While incredibly powerful, interpreting on-chain data isn’t without its challenges. It requires a nuanced understanding of various metrics and their context. For instance, a single large transaction could represent an internal wallet transfer by an exchange, rather than a genuine sale or purchase by an investor. Analysts must employ sophisticated techniques to filter out such noise and accurately identify meaningful trends. Moreover, on-chain data provides insights into supply-side dynamics, but it doesn’t account for all market drivers. Macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, technological developments, and broader geopolitical events also play significant roles in shaping Bitcoin’s price. Therefore, on-chain analysis should be used as one powerful tool in a comprehensive analytical toolkit, rather than the sole determinant of investment decisions. Actionable Insights for Your Bitcoin Strategy So, what does this divergence mean for you, the individual investor? Firstly, it reinforces the idea that conviction is key. While retail investors might be swayed by short-term price movements, the steady accumulation by whales suggests a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. This doesn’t mean you should blindly follow the whales, but it does provide a perspective that encourages a longer-term outlook rather than panic selling during dips. Secondly, it highlights the importance of doing your own research. While Glassnode’s data is invaluable, understanding your own financial goals and risk tolerance is paramount. Consider a dollar-cost averaging strategy to mitigate the impact of volatility, rather than trying to time the market perfectly. Finally, embrace the transparency of the blockchain. Tools and analyses derived from on-chain data can empower you to make more informed decisions, moving beyond speculative narratives to understand the underlying movements of Bitcoin’s supply and demand. By paying attention to these fundamental shifts, you can better position yourself in a volatile yet promising market. Conclusion: A Tale of Two Investor Worlds The latest revelations from Glassnode paint a compelling picture of the current Bitcoin landscape: a clear and critical divide between the confident accumulation of Bitcoin whales and the cautious selling by many retail holders . This divergence in market sentiment , uncovered through meticulous on-chain data analysis, underscores the varying perspectives and strategies at play. While small investors may be reacting to short-term pressures, the consistent buying by large entities signals a profound belief in Bitcoin’s enduring value proposition. This powerful insight serves as a reminder that understanding the fundamental movements of coins on the blockchain is essential for truly grasping the market’s pulse. As Bitcoin continues its journey, monitoring these on-chain dynamics will remain crucial for discerning its true trajectory.

2025-07-09T18:03:09,"Solana  ETFs See $78M Inflows as Interest in Altcoin Investment Products Grows","Three Solana-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) listed in the U.S. have quietly pulled in $78 million over the past month, reflecting rising interest in altcoin-backed investment products despite the outsized dominance of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) in ETF markets. The Solana REX-Osprey SOL + Staking ETF (SSK), which launched July 2, has already attracted over $41 million in assets under management, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Meanwhile, Volatility Shares’ leveraged Solana ETF (SOLT) has accumulated $69 million year-to-date, and its regular Solana ETF (SOLZ) holds $23 million. “It’s all much smaller than btc or eth but lot of green numbers = good,” Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote in a post on X. The inflows come as several asset managers prepare for what they hope will be the next major crypto ETF approval: a spot Solana fund that includes staking rewards. While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to approve such a product, industry analysts are increasingly optimistic. Earlier this week, CoinDesk reported that the SEC requested issuers re-file key documents by the end of July, signaling a potentially faster timeline than the October deadline originally anticipated. If so, solana (SOL) would join bitcoin and ether as one of the few cryptocurrencies available to U.S. investors through spot ETFs. The bitcoin ETFs, launched in January, have drawn nearly $50 billion in capital, transforming the market for digital assets and placing BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) among the top revenue-generating funds of any kind. IBIT alone now holds 700,000 BTC . Ethereum ETFs, which were approved more recently, have pulled in about $4.5 billion so far.

Major U.S. stock indices rose on Wednesday, July 9, as tech stocks offset macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from new tariff threats. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 136.07 points, or 0.31%, while the S&P 500 added 0.36%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite led the gains with a 0.65% increase. Nvidia was among the top-performing large-cap stocks, rising 2% during the session. The rally propelled the chipmaker past Microsoft and Apple, making it the first company in history to reach a $4 trillion market capitalization. The surge is driven by Nvidia’s central role in providing the hardware that powers advanced artificial intelligence models.

2025-07-09T17:41:42,"Best Crypto to Buy As Ethereum Accumulation Rises - Altcoin Season Next?","Ethereum has been unusually quiet, and that silence is starting to look deliberate. For several weeks now, ETH has hovered around the $2500 mark with little deviation, absorbing volatility while volumes steadily rise. That kind of stability, especially in a token known for wide swings, signals preparation rather than hesitation. Institutional activity has picked up considerably. Spot transactions are growing heavier, and on-chain metrics point to a steady surge in interest, not just from retail but from long-term allocators as well. The market seems to be watching ETH with a kind of controlled anticipation, and that attention has a direction. Ethereum’s Shift from Store to Engine and What That Means for the Rest of the Market In the last few weeks, two publicly listed companies have made massive moves into ETH. Bit Digital, a Nasdaq-traded firm, sold off its Bitcoin reserves and converted over $200 million into ETH, stating openly that Ethereum’s yield structure and long-term financial utility aligned better with its strategy. They swapped all of their BTC for ETH 😮This makes @BitDigital_BTBT the 3rd largest ETH holder as a publicly traded company ($250M+ worth). pic.twitter.com/fBmjqYS21u — FOMO HOUR (@fomohour) July 8, 2025 Around the same time, SharpLink Gaming added over 200,000 ETH to its treasury and staked the entire amount. Both firms raised additional capital from public markets specifically to increase their Ethereum holdings. These are not minor portfolio shifts. They reflect a structural bet on ETH as a productive, programmable asset rather than a speculative one. ⚡️BIG: SharpLink Gaming has purchased 7,689 $ETH worth $19.2 million, increasing its total Ethereum holdings to 205,634 $ETH . This makes @SharpLinkGaming (NASDAQ: $SBET ) the largest publicly traded $ETH holder and shows its aggressive buying strategy as institutional demand… pic.twitter.com/Wf794A2OSU — Crypto Coin Show (@CryptoCoinShow) July 9, 2025 What makes this more significant is the timing. Ethereum has remained steady around the $2500 level while trading volume continues to rise. Liquidity has also returned in the form of ERC-20 stablecoins, which just hit a record $121 billion in supply. These are conditions that typically set the floor for a wider altcoin breakout. Ethereum’s consolidation, coupled with rising participation and large-scale repositioning by major players, is laying the groundwork. And when ETH becomes the magnet, altcoins do not need to ask for attention, they just need to be close enough to catch the spillover. That season is not here yet, but the air has changed. The capital is waiting, and the rotation could begin the moment ETH makes its next real move. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Tokens That Could Pump As the Altcoin Season Approaches Snorter Snorter is built for how crypto is actually used, not how it is marketed. Its core utility lies in its deep integration with Telegram, which remains the most active layer of crypto communication today. Rather than forcing users to adopt a new interface or switch platforms, Snorter embeds an entire analytical and executional framework within a space traders and community members already trust. It handles everything from wallet scanning to sentiment tracking to trade execution, all through conversational prompts inside Telegram chats. This kind of embedded design does not just reduce friction. It changes the speed of action. Users no longer need to move between tools, copy-paste data, or rely on third-party dashboards. Everything flows in real time, inside the conversation. The bot is fast, adaptable, and transparent in its logic, which matters more as noise returns to the market. SNORT was also dubbed to be one of the highest potential presales to consider investing in by top creators and YouTubers like ClayBro and many others, further adding to its popularity. If Ethereum’s current steadiness does lead to a renewed rotation into altcoins, the attention will not be quiet. Snorter is made for that kind of environment. It does not rely on a token pump or abstract hype. Its appeal lies in clarity and control, which become more valuable when volatility returns. As users re-engage, they are likely to choose tools that keep them rooted in the places they already operate from. Snorter sits exactly in that pocket. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper exists to serve a different demand; one grounded in Bitcoin’s base layer but unhindered by its limitations. Built as a Layer 2 network specifically for Bitcoin, Hyper enables smart contracts, low-fee transactions, and application-level programmability without moving away from Bitcoin’s core security and settlement structure. This makes it a functional extension rather than a departure. The logic behind it is straightforward. Bitcoin is often framed as digital gold, but gold cannot process a microtransaction, power a decentralized app, or offer smart execution conditions. Hyper introduces that missing logic while keeping BTC at the center. It is not trying to compete on ecosystem size. It is building a parallel utility set that speaks to Bitcoin’s own user base. The timing is relevant. As Ethereum continues to attract institutional holders and redefine itself as a foundational financial asset, capital is likely to look for complementary systems rather than pure alternatives. Bitcoin Hyper fits into that landscape precisely because it does not ask users to abandon BTC. It simply gives them a way to do more with it. If liquidity begins to flow more widely, protocols that offer this kind of practical expansion will likely stand out, not because they promise more, but because they unlock what was previously restricted. SUBBD SUBBD is structured around creators, not tokens. It does not depend on speculative traction or narrative cycles. Instead, it offers a model where content ownership, discovery, and monetization are built into the system itself. Unlike traditional platforms that control reach and revenue through opaque algorithms, SUBBD allows creators to embed access rules, membership layers, and monetization logic directly into their work using smart contracts. This approach turns each creator into their own ecosystem. Whether it is video, writing, audio, or niche community content, the rules are written by the creator and enforced by the platform’s underlying protocol. This creates consistency in experience and revenue without forcing users or creators into subscription silos or ad-based engagement loops. SUBBD is not trying to rebuild social media. It is building a content economy from the creator upward. Meet your new favorite group chat 😏📲Join SUBBDExclusives on Telegram, where the hottest creators and the most loyal fans connect in real time.🔥 Chat. React. Repeat.Because the feed’s hot, but the group chat is on fire.📲 Search SUBBDExclusives on Telegram now. pic.twitter.com/WdzsXqB9K9 — SUBBD (@SUBBDofficial) June 26, 2025 As Ethereum strengthens its role in programmable finance, and as liquidity trickles outward, platforms like SUBBD become more relevant. They provide application-level proof of what on-chain logic can do outside of finance. If an altcoin cycle begins to take shape, the market will likely reward projects that demonstrate actual embedded utility and content remains one of the most defensible and scalable categories for that kind of use. SUBBD operates there with precision. Best Wallet Best Wallet is not built for speculation. It is designed for everyday crypto use, and that distinction changes how it functions. At its core, it is a multi-chain Web3 wallet that handles asset storage, transaction execution, token discovery, and dApp access in one continuous interface. The layout is clean, but more importantly, the experience is intentional. Navigation feels immediate. Tasks that are typically segmented- like bridging assets, interacting with staking pools, or participating in presales are streamlined into processes that feel native. The strength of Best Wallet lies in its architecture. It does not treat networks like compartments. It allows users to move across Ethereum, Solana, and other major ecosystems without technical barriers. For those entering the market now, that kind of flexibility is essential. The focus has shifted from holding assets to interacting with them, and wallets need to reflect that shift. As Ethereum consolidates and altcoin attention begins to re-emerge, users will need tools that make participation seamless. That includes managing multiple assets, navigating early-stage launches, and verifying smart contract permissions without relying on clunky workarounds. Best Wallet meets that need with actual infrastructure, not marketing features. If a new cycle builds from the base Ethereum is laying down, the tools that manage and extend that access will play a central role. Best Wallet positions itself there; not as a gateway, but as a full system for interaction. That positioning may prove valuable as user activity returns. Conclusion As Ethereum continues to consolidate and institutional alignment grows stronger, the market is beginning to shift its posture. What was once a scattered field of speculation is becoming a more focused search for function. If this trend continues and an altcoin season does unfold, it will not reward noise; it will reward readiness. The assets discussed above each reflect a different layer of that logic. Some enhance user access, some extend existing networks, and others introduce entirely new models of interaction. What unites them is timing. They are not waiting for a trend. They are built for the conditions that may arrive once the next phase begins. That alone makes them worth watching now. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

2025-07-09T17:33:13,"BTCI: Squeezing ~30% Distribution Yield From Bitcoin","Summary BTCI offers high monthly 'income' by writing call options on Bitcoin futures but carries significant risk due to Bitcoin's volatility. The strong performance of Bitcoin and its high 30%+ distribution yield has attracted relatively strong investor interest, with AUM rising quickly. While BTCI has outperformed traditional assets by a wide margin, its options strategy can cap upside and lead to underperformance versus pure Bitcoin ETFs in strong rallies. BTCI is best suited for income-focused investors comfortable with volatility but is not appropriate for the risk-averse given the potential for rapid declines. Written by Nick Ackerman, co-produced by Stanford Chemist NEOS is an ETF sponsor that has been bringing some unique ETFs to the market. One of those is the NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF ( BTCI ), launched toward the end of 2024. This is a relatively newer fund, but the idea is rather simple: the fund holds cash equivalents and Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) exposure through an ETF and long call options while it also writes call options against Bitcoin futures. The fund is actively managed with a ""data-driven call option strategy."" By writing call options, this provides the fund with option premiums, which can be distributed to investors. I believe this fund is rather risky overall and definitely not for those risk-averse investors. However, someone who is interested in investing in Bitcoin and wants high distribution could find it an interesting idea. BTCI Basics Dividend Frequency: Monthly. Dividend Yield: 2.10% SEC yield, 30.25% Distribution Yield. Expense Ratio: 0.98%. Leverage: N/A. Managed Assets: $345.1 million. Structure: Active ETF. BTCI's investment objective is to ""generate high monthly income with the potential for appreciation based on exposure to exchange-traded products (""ETP"") that have direct exposure to Bitcoin. They continue with seeking ""to distribute monthly income generated from writing call options on Bitcoin Futures ETFs."" The fund is actively managed and ""seeks to offer upside potential via efficient exposure to Bitcoin ETPs."" Despite a relatively short history of coming to market only on October 17, 2024, the fund has garnered much interest, and AUM has risen rapidly. Generally, a high distribution rate can cause a lot of attention. The popularity of Bitcoin also appears to be growing, thanks to its very strong returns as well. Of course, we know that is history, and past performance is no guarantee of future results. So, make of that what you will. BTCI's Portfolio BTCI's portfolio is quite simple, as it tends to be for this single-asset ETF offering. They hold VanEck Bitcoin ETF ( HODL ) as their more straightforward exposure to Bitcoin; however, it can get a bit more complicated with the options positioning. This is because they go long and short Bitcoin call options as well as short puts. Overall, the fund holds the highest allocation to U.S. Treasury Bills.

Because the Fund’s exposure to the Bitcoin Futures ETF is obtained via options instead of owning the reference asset, the Fund’s exposure is considered to be “synthetic.” The synthetic exposure is created through the combination of purchasing call options and selling put options generally at the same strike price with the same expiration. This combination synthetically creates the upside and downside participation in the price returns of the Bitcoin Futures ETF. The Fund will primarily gain exposure to increases in value experienced by the Bitcoin Futures ETF through the purchase of call options. As a buyer of these options, the Fund pays a premium to the seller of the options. The Fund will primarily gain exposure to decreases in value experienced by the Bitcoin Futures ETF through the sale of put options. As the seller of these options, the Fund receives a premium from the buyer of the options. In combination, the purchased call and sold put options generally provide exposure to price returns of the Bitcoin Futures ETF both on the upside and downside. Performance And Distribution The fund offers an extremely high distribution rate of ~30% so far. As long as Bitcoin can continue to have a strong run, this fund could actually achieve that type of return. As we can see, the fund has delivered market-beating returns against both equities and fixed income—this is by a huge margin too. The market price was $50 at launch and is now closer to $60, indicating that there has been some appreciation on top of the high distribution rate. YCharts However, I believe there is considerable risk in investing in Bitcoin as it can be quite a volatile asset. In fact, that's generally why the distribution rate can be so high, as the volatility increases, the option premiums are brought in. For example, the fund utilizes writing options (and goes long) with the CBOE Mini Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index, which has an implied volatility of around 35% on the $250 call. CBOE Mini Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index (Fidelity) For some context, the implied volatility for the SPDR® S&P 500® ETF ( SPY ) for the first call strike below the current trading price is at ~17%. By writing those calls, the fund generates the cash flow provided by collecting the premiums and distributing them through a monthly distribution. Given the high allocation to U.S. Treasury Bills, that's also generating some interest payments within the fund. BTCI Distribution History (Seeking Alpha) Basically, that is where the 30-day SEC Yield of 2.10% is coming in while the fund's distribution rate is listed at 30.25% currently on the fund's website. BTCI Distribution and Expenses (NEOS) However, there is some downside to the fund utilizing options writing to generate the cash for the distribution. It comes with the risk that all call writing funds have to contend with, and that is the upside cap when an underlying investment is running sharply higher. This cap can get hit, and it can mean that the fund can limit its upside. In fact, the fund's latest semi-annual report for an abbreviated period showed that the fund saw realized losses from the written option contracts. BTCI Semi-Annual Report (NEOS) That's where you can see that BTCI has actually underperformed its ETF holding, HODL, by quite a meaningful margin. YCharts However, there can be some potential downside protection with a call writing strategy. It isn't much, but the premiums received offset declines in the underlying instruments that BTCI is long as well. In a flat market, BTCI would also be considered outperforming, as even if the underlying is moving sideways, those premiums can still be collected for some gains. One fund I hold that is in the Bitcoin space, while also paying a monthly distribution, is ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ). The fund has outperformed BTCI during this period since the ETF's inception. YCharts However, the fund invests in futures and swaps for its Bitcoin exposure. It also doesn't utilize an options writing strategy, but the distributions come from the gains (and interest payments from the underlying Treasury holdings) produced on those derivatives. If those gains stopped, the distribution would fall dramatically—closer to the yield on Treasury Bills minus the 0.95% expense ratio. That's why you'll see the distribution history looks like this: BITO Distribution History (Seeking Alpha) As a more income-focused investor, I definitely prefer BITO and BTCI compared to holding a Bitcoin ETF or holding Bitcoin itself. I'm aware of not participating as much in the overall total returns. However, I find peace of mind, and that it is beneficial to have these gains/income distributed out monthly. If there is a collapse in Bitcoin, then I know some gains will be locked in or losses limited. Conclusion BTCI is a risky strategy as Bitcoin is considered quite volatile. At the same time, it has performed extremely well, and that has meant a lot of investor interest is being driven in that direction. BTCI provides exposure to Bitcoin either through ETFs or synthetically with options; it then applies an options writing strategy over the portfolio, which provides a significant monthly distribution to investors. High distributions tend to gain a lot of investor interest, so it might not be too surprising to see how fast this ETF is seeing inflows. However, I would reiterate that it does not appear to be appropriate for more risk-averse investors. The fund has experienced significant appreciation thanks to strong gains from Bitcoin, but such strong gains will not be guaranteed going forward. April of this year provided a good example of how far Bitcoin and this ETF can fall quite rapidly.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800204-btci-squeezing-30-percent-distribution-yield-from-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|REGULATION|MARKET","BTC-USD|HODL|SPY|BITO|BTCI",cryptocompare
