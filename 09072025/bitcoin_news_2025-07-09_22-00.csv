2025-07-09T19:36:05,"Russian businesses to be fined for crypto payroll","Russian companies that have been tempted to pay employees in cryptocurrency are likely to be hit with hefty fines, according to labor authorities in Moscow. Crypto has been gaining traction as a means of remuneration since Russia permitted limited use of cryptocurrencies in cross-border transactions, but regulators are adamant that the ruble remains the only legal tender, including when it comes to wages. Russia’s labor agency threatens fines for crypto salaries Russian businesses are not allowed to pay salaries in cryptocurrency, fully or partially, according to Russia’s State Labor Inspectorate. The agency outlined its categorical stance in a response to a request from employers for clarification on the matter, the Russian daily Izvestia unveiled this week. The inspectorate’s position has been confirmed by the Ministry of Labor, the publication added. According to the country’s Labor Code, salaries can be paid exclusively with money, and cryptocurrency has so far been recognized only as property in Russia, the article explained. Using digital coins for payroll purposes has become relevant since the Russian government legalized crypto settlements in foreign trade to help companies deal with financial restrictions imposed over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Since 2024, legal entities have been permitted to make international payments in crypto through state-authorized platforms and strictly within an “experimental legal regime” (ELR). The arrangement has tempted some employers to pay wages this way as well. Questions regarding the option also arise from the convenience of cross-border crypto transfers that are fast and low-cost. That makes them attractive for Russian firms working with foreign specialists, explained Alexander Khaminsky from the industry organization Business Russia. However, using anything other than the ruble as a means of payment, outside the ELR, is still against the law in Russia. And no exception has been made so far that would allow salaries to be legally paid in digital assets, noted Maxim Barashev, managing partner at the BBNP law firm. According to Khaminsky, all this leads to the following conclusion: “Payments in crypto carry legal risks for the employer.” At present, fines for such offenses are relatively small, 50,000 rubles at the most (a little over $600). But at the same time, the Russian parliament is now considering a bill that seeks to raise the monetary penalty for illegal payments with crypto to 1 million rubles (almost $13,000). Russian companies want to pay crypto wages, Moscow says ‘No’ Interest in crypto payments for remuneration, as an alternative to bank wires of fiat, has been growing around the world, not least due to the increasing number of remote jobs. Traditional channels can be slow and costly, slashing up to 6% of the payroll. In the case of Russia, international sanctions are also a major concern. Euro and dollar transactions may not go through at all, commented Victoria Pavlyushina, partner at the Russian Agency for Economy Transformation and Development. Introducing cryptocurrencies into the Russian economy is “inevitable,” according to Damir Kudryakov, an expert at the Faculty of Economics of the RUDN University. Companies nowadays are increasingly looking for alternatives to the classic banking tools, he added. The authorities in Moscow fear, however, that besides undermining Russia’s national currency and its most modern incarnation, the digital ruble , cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) can also allow businesses and employees to “optimize” their tax expenses and prevent regulators from tracking financial flows. Pavlyushina pointed out: “A mass transition to it [crypto] threatens loss of personal income tax and insurance premiums, as well as a decrease in the role of the ruble.” “We continue to be against using cryptocurrencies in payments inside the country. That is, ‘yes’ for foreign economic activity, ‘yes’ for particularly qualified investors as a target for investments. Nevertheless, we are against their use as a means of payment,” Russia’s central bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina was recently quoted as stating. Elsewhere, crypto salaries have already become a viable option for employers and employees alike in a number of countries, Izvestia noted in its article , giving the United States, Japan, Switzerland, and Portugal as examples.

2025-07-09T19:31:59,"Donald Trump Jr. bought 350,000 shares in Thumzup Media Corp. for over $4 million","Donald Trump Jr. has taken a $4.3 million leap into the crypto economy through a struggling social media startup called Thumzup Media Corp, based in Los Angeles, according to Bloomberg . On Wednesday, the company disclosed in a public filing that Donald picked up 350,000 shares, making him one of the largest shareholders. The deal was made based on advice from his investment manager, and Donald will not be playing any operational role at the firm. This new stake follows a $6 million private placement of convertible preferred stock organized last week by Dominari Securities, an investment bank where both Donald and his brother Eric Trump serve as advisers to the parent company. The stock closed at $12.36 per share on Tuesday but had dropped 17% by midday Wednesday after a recent run-up of 75% over four sessions as of press time. Despite the volatility, Donny went ahead with the purchase. Company loses money, stacks Bitcoin, and adds six more coins Thumzup runs an app that pays users to post brand promotions on Instagram, but it isn’t bringing in much cash. The company brought in just $151 in revenue during the first quarter of the year, while spending $2.2 million. As losses grow, the company’s response has been to stockpile crypto. In January, Thumzup said it would park most of its liquid assets in Bitcoin , and by now it has more than $2 million worth. Today, the firm said it’s expanding that strategy to include six additional coins, using proceeds from the private placement to do so. None of the companies or individuals involved gave public comments. A spokesperson for the Trump Organization, where Donny serves as Executive Vice President, didn’t respond to messages. Thumzup and Dominari both declined to comment as well. Meanwhile, more Trump-aligned businesses are heading in the same direction. Dominari began investing in a Bitcoin ETF in February. In March, Eric joined the board of advisers at Metaplanet, a former hotel company in Japan that now focuses on buying up Bitcoin. And the Trump Media & Technology Group, which runs Truth Social, raised $2.3 billion for Bitcoin investments. President Donald Trump, now back in the White House, has publicly vowed to make the United States the “crypto capital of the world.” His wealth, estimated at $6.5 billion by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has been boosted by the family’s crypto-heavy ventures like World Liberty Financial and the Trump memecoin.

2025-07-09T19:15:42,"Sen. Warren warns that the CLARITY bill could allow Meta, Tesla, and other major firms to bypass SEC rules","Senator Elizabeth Warren is sounding the alarm over what she sees as a dangerous loophole in new crypto legislation. As the House prepares to vote on the CLARITY bill next week, Lummis warns that its current language could allow major publicly traded companies like Meta or Tesla to sidestep decades of investor protections simply by tokenizing their assets. In a Wednesday hearing of the Senate Banking Committee to address crypto market structure legislation, Senator Warren said that new crypto rules shouldn’t open a back door to destroy the securities laws. In a statement, Warren said, “Think for just a minute about what that means. Under the House bill, a publicly-traded company like Meta or Tesla could simply decide to put its stock on the blockchain and POOF! it would escape all SEC regulation.” This simply means that if these companies decided to turn their stocks into a crypto token and put it on blockchain under the CLARITY bill, it might no longer be subject to the SEC regulation like financial disclosures and investor protection. This could create a loophole that allows big companies to evade financial regulations by calling their stocks or assets “crypto tokens.” Shut down the superhighway for presidential corruption Warren has accused Trump of using his position to make billionaires richer. She asked Congress to shut down the president’s crypto corruption. This means prohibiting public officials, including the president, from issuing, sponsoring, or profiting from crypto tokens. She said that Trump has already benefited from issuing his stablecoin, his memecoin, owning a Bitcoin mining company, and controlling a huge portfolio of crypto investments. According to reports, the President and his associates pocketed more than $320 million alone from the $TRUMP memecoin , while most retail investors who bought that token lost money. Also, Bloomberg reported that Trump had added at least $620 million to his portfolio in a matter of months due to his crypto investments. Lummis said, “ If we’re going to provide rules of the road for crypto, we need to shut down this superhighway for presidential corruption at the same time.” Lummis asks for equal protection from scammers Crypto investors should have the same protections from getting scammed or cheated as investors in any other asset. According to Warren, the protection shouldn’t be bigger, but it should be the same. She gave an example of the rules prohibiting stock exchanges from simultaneously serving as brokers and giving preferential treatment to their own trades over their customers’ should be applied to the crypto market. She also said that the law should ensure that turmoil in the crypto market doesn’t infect the traditional financial system. That means making sure that taxpayers are not on the hook for backstopping risky crypto bets. There should be strong capital, liquidity, and risk management safeguards for crypto exchanges, crypto dealers, and other middle-market players so they can meet their obligations to customers and counterparties even when the market is unstable. In addition, she asked that the law should counter the threat of illicit finance with commonsense rules to fight crime and protect our national security. Crypto service providers that act as financial institutions must be required to implement anti-money laundering programs. She highlighted figures from the FBI that say that Americans lost more than $9 billion to crypto fraud last year. It was a 66% increase from the year prior. She said, “Republicans refused to strengthen AML rules and close sanctions loopholes in the GENIUS Act and said they’d deal with it in a crypto market structure bill. So this is it. No more kicking the can down the road. Now is the time to solve that problem.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-07-09T19:06:38,"Cathie Wood's ARK: Bitcoin's Bullish Momentum Slows as Long-Term Holder Stacks Hit Record","Bitcoin's price saw a modest 2.55% increase in June, failing to surpass its May peak of $112,000. The cryptocurrency continues to trade within a narrow range, reflecting a period of consolidation, according to ARK Invest's latest Bitcoin Monthly report . A significant development highlighted in the report is the rise in long-term holders (LTHs), who now possess 74% of the total bitcoin supply — a level not seen in 15 years. This suggests a strong conviction among seasoned investors, even as the influx of new buyers diminishes. However, the report also points to a decline in on-chain capital flows during the second quarter, as measured by the Market-Value-to-Realized-Value (MVRV) momentum metric. This downturn indicates a cooling in market enthusiasm and a potential shift in investor sentiment. In the broader economic context, the U.S. dollar (as measured by the Fed’s Nominal Broad Trade Weighted Dollar Index) keeps climbing, defying the dominant narrative of dollar debasement that has fueled long-term bullish sentiment in crypto. Meanwhile, inflation showed continued signs of easing, raising questions about bitcoin’s traditional appeal as an inflation hedge — though, on the flip side, lower inflation may also lead to lower federal funding rates, something that tends to boost risk-on assets like tech stocks and cryptocurrencies. Housing appears to be a weak link, the report noted, highlighting a growing gap between elevated homeowner expectations and a sharp drop in home sales. This divergence hints at potential strain in consumer confidence and broader economic activity.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/09/cathie-woods-ark-bitcoins-bullish-momentum-slows-as-long-term-holder-stacks-hit-record,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT","Markets|ARK Invest|Bitcoin|News",cryptocompare

Along with the recent notable surge in SOL’s price is a sharp increase in user activity across the prominent Solana network. User Activity On The Solana Network Climbs Sharply Solana’s renewed upward price action is being met with growing participation and investors’ interest in the SOL blockchain. Ali Martinez, an investor and crypto expert, reported the recent advancement in activity in a post on the X (formerly Twitter) platform. According to Ali Martinez, user activity on the Solana network has surged sharply to crucial levels. It is worth noting that the notable increase in activity marks one of the network’s strongest spikes of participation in recent months. The rise in on-chain activity is centered around the surge in Solana’s daily active addresses, highlighting the ecosystem’s increased enthusiasm. SOL’s number of active addresses is currently rising to new territories, recording millions of engaging wallets. Data from Santiment, a leading on-chain analytics firm, shared by Martinez reveals that more than 14.63 million SOL addresses were active in the last 24 hours. Such a significant increase in active addresses signals a fresh wave of user engagement. In addition to demonstrating increased conviction in the network’s speed and scalability, this dramatic increase in active addresses also emphasizes Solana’s solidifying position as one of the most popular blockchains in the current cryptocurrency sector. A persistent surge in active addresses could set the stage for a bounce as the bull market phase strengthens. Bigger Moves Incoming For SOL Historically, this increase in active addresses has preceded price spikes, which raises the potential for a continued upward trend. After delving into the recent action of SOL, Batman, a crypto investor, stated that the altcoin is preparing for its next step while firmly maintaining its position above key support zones. If SOL’s price closes the candle above the $200 mark, it might trigger a major upside move to new all-time highs. According to the expert, the altcoin’s close above $200 is a green signal to open long positions, and traders are stacking below the level in silence. Looking at the chart, Batman anticipates a huge rally to the $350 price level in the last quarter of this year. SOL’s anticipated surge could be bolstered by growing demand as Batman drew attention to Solana’s on-chain activity. The expert reported that wallet addresses containing tokenized stocks on the blockchain increased from 4,400 to 22,500 to 33,300 in a single day. This sharp uptick in wallets represents a 7.5x rise in the last two days. Batman is confident that these wallet addresses will continue to rise, highlighting that bigger price moves are on the way for Solana.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/solana-blockchain-lights-up/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Solana|Ali Martinez|Batman|Santiment|SOL|SOL news|SOL price|solana|Solana Active Addresses|Solana Blockchain|Solana news|Solana price|Solana Wallets|solusd|SOLUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-07-09T19:00:34,"Binance Proof of Reserves: Unveiling Crucial Shifts in BTC and ETH Holdings","In the dynamic and often unpredictable world of cryptocurrencies, trust is the ultimate currency. For millions of users worldwide, knowing that their digital assets are secure and verifiable is paramount. This is precisely why initiatives like Proof of Reserves (POR) have become a cornerstone for major exchanges. Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally, consistently publishes its Proof of Reserves reports, offering a crucial glimpse into its financial health and the composition of its user funds. Their latest report, based on a July 1 snapshot, has unveiled some fascinating and perhaps unexpected shifts in asset distribution, particularly concerning BTC holdings , ETH holdings , and a notable increase in USDT holdings . What do these changes truly signify for the broader market and for your crypto portfolio? Understanding Binance Proof of Reserves: A Cornerstone of Trust Before we dive into the specifics of the latest report, it’s essential to grasp what a Proof of Reserves report entails and why it’s so vital in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. In essence, a Proof of Reserves is an independent audit that verifies a cryptocurrency exchange holds the assets it claims to on behalf of its users. This process typically involves cryptographic proofs, like Merkle Trees, to allow individual users to verify their own funds are included in the total reserves without revealing their personal information. The importance of POR was starkly highlighted in the wake of significant industry events, particularly the collapse of FTX. These incidents underscored the critical need for exchanges to demonstrate solvency and transparency. By regularly publishing these reports, Binance aims to foster greater confidence among its user base, showing that customer funds are indeed backed 1:1 and are not being used for undisclosed purposes. It’s a proactive step towards building a more transparent and accountable financial system, setting a benchmark for crypto transparency across the industry. Crucial Shifts: Diving Deep into Binance’s BTC Holdings and ETH Holdings The 32nd Proof of Reserves report from Binance, based on a snapshot taken on July 1, provides a detailed look at the exchange’s reserves. The figures, as reported by Wu Blockchain on X, indicate a noticeable recalibration of assets held on the platform. Let’s break down the key changes: Bitcoin (BTC) Holdings: User BTC holdings stood at 573,000. This represents a decline of 3.27% compared to the figures from June. Ethereum (ETH) Holdings: User ETH holdings also saw a decrease, falling by 5.34% to 5.051 million. These declines in two of the largest and most prominent cryptocurrencies on the platform raise important questions. What factors could be contributing to this shift? Several possibilities come to mind: User Withdrawals and Self-Custody: A common trend in the crypto space, especially after market turbulence, is for users to move their assets off exchanges and into self-custody solutions (like hardware wallets). This is often driven by a desire for greater control and security, aligning with the core ethos of decentralization. Market Volatility and De-risking: The crypto market is known for its volatility. Users might be reducing their exposure to more volatile assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, opting to hold less on exchanges or rebalancing their portfolios in response to market conditions. Profit-Taking or Reallocation: Users might be selling off portions of their BTC and ETH holdings, either to realize profits or to reallocate funds into other assets or investment opportunities outside of the Binance ecosystem. It’s important to note that a decline in exchange BTC holdings or ETH holdings doesn’t necessarily indicate a lack of confidence in the assets themselves, but rather a shift in where users prefer to hold them or how they are managing their risk exposure. The Rising Tide: Exploring the Implications of Increased USDT Holdings While Bitcoin and Ethereum saw declines, the report highlighted a significant increase in Tether (USDT) holdings: Tether (USDT) Holdings: User USDT holdings rose by 2.64% to an impressive 29.59 billion. This increase in stablecoin holdings is particularly noteworthy and can be interpreted in several ways, each shedding light on current market sentiment and user behavior: Flight to Safety: During periods of market uncertainty or volatility, stablecoins like USDT often serve as a safe haven. Users might be converting their more volatile assets into stablecoins to preserve capital, effectively waiting out potential downturns without exiting the crypto market entirely. Preparation for Trading Opportunities: An increase in stablecoin reserves on an exchange can also indicate that users are positioning themselves for future trading opportunities. Having readily available USDT allows traders to quickly enter new positions when they identify favorable market conditions or dips in asset prices. Increased Trading Activity: USDT is a primary trading pair for a vast number of cryptocurrencies. Higher USDT holdings on the exchange could also reflect an increase in overall trading activity or liquidity being held for various trading strategies. Yield Opportunities: Some users might be holding USDT on the exchange to participate in staking, lending, or other yield-generating opportunities offered by Binance or integrated DeFi protocols. The rise in USDT holdings suggests a strategic decision by users to maintain liquidity and stability within the exchange environment, whether for defensive purposes or to capitalize on future market movements. Why Crypto Transparency Matters: Beyond Just Numbers The significance of Binance’s Proof of Reserves reports extends far beyond just the fluctuating numbers of specific cryptocurrencies. These reports are foundational to building trust and legitimacy in the nascent crypto industry. Here’s why crypto transparency is more critical than ever: Restoring Confidence: In an industry that has faced its share of scandals and collapses, transparent reporting helps restore and maintain user confidence. It assures users that their funds are not being mismanaged or used for undisclosed purposes. Reducing Systemic Risk: By regularly verifying reserves, exchanges contribute to reducing systemic risk within the broader crypto ecosystem. It prevents situations where exchanges operate with fractional reserves, which can lead to widespread financial instability. Setting Industry Standards: Major exchanges like Binance, by committing to regular POR, set a precedent for others in the industry. This encourages a culture of accountability and pushes for higher operational standards across the board. Regulatory Acceptance: As regulators worldwide grapple with how to oversee the crypto space, transparent reporting mechanisms like POR can play a crucial role. They provide regulators with verifiable data, potentially paving the way for more favorable regulatory frameworks and mainstream adoption. Empowering Users: Ultimately, transparency empowers users. It gives them the information needed to make informed decisions about where to store their assets and which platforms to trust. These reports are not just compliance checkboxes; they are vital tools for fostering a healthy, sustainable, and trustworthy digital asset economy. Navigating the Nuances: Challenges and What These Binance Proof of Reserves Reports Don’t Tell Us While Proof of Reserves reports are a monumental step forward for crypto transparency , it’s also important to approach them with a nuanced understanding of their limitations. No single report can paint a complete picture, and there are aspects that these snapshots typically don’t fully address: Snapshot in Time: A POR report is just that—a snapshot. It reflects the exchange’s reserves at a specific moment. The composition of assets can change rapidly, sometimes within hours or minutes, due to high trading volumes and user activity. It doesn’t provide a real-time, continuous audit. Liabilities Side: While POR verifies the assets held by the exchange, it often provides less detail about the exchange’s liabilities (what it owes to users). A true, comprehensive audit would involve both proof of assets and proof of liabilities to ensure full solvency. Exchanges like Binance have made strides in this area by integrating Merkle Tree proofs for user verification, but the full picture of liabilities can still be complex. Off-Chain Assets: POR typically focuses on on-chain assets. However, exchanges may hold some assets in off-chain or cold storage solutions, which are harder to verify cryptographically in a public report. Scope of Assets: Not all assets listed on an exchange may be included in the POR. While major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins are usually covered, smaller altcoins might not always be. Reliance on Auditor: While the process involves cryptographic verification, there’s still an element of trust placed in the third-party auditor or the exchange’s internal processes for generating and presenting the data. Understanding these limitations is crucial for users to maintain a healthy skepticism and to complement their reliance on POR with other due diligence practices. Actionable Insights for Users: What to Do with This Information? So, what should you, as a cryptocurrency user, take away from Binance’s latest Proof of Reserves report and the broader discussion around crypto transparency ? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Regularly review POR reports from exchanges you use. While they are snapshots, consistent positive reports over time can build confidence. Pay attention to trends in BTC holdings , ETH holdings , and USDT holdings . Consider Self-Custody: For long-term holdings, especially significant amounts, consider moving your assets to a hardware wallet or other self-custody solutions. This gives you direct control over your private keys, reducing reliance on any third-party exchange. Diversify Your Holdings: The shifts seen in Binance’s report underscore the dynamic nature of crypto assets. Diversifying your portfolio across different assets and potentially different trusted platforms can mitigate risk. Understand Market Sentiment: Changes in exchange holdings can be a good indicator of broader market sentiment. An increase in stablecoins, for instance, might suggest caution among traders, while an increase in volatile assets could signal growing bullishness. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never solely rely on a single report or news piece. Combine information from POR reports with broader market analysis, news from reputable sources, and your own risk assessment before making financial decisions. The Future of Trust: What’s Next for Crypto Transparency?

2025-07-09T18:43:46,"Bitcoin Price Rises Above $109K as Trump Calls for Biggest Interest Rate Cut in History","US President Donald Trump continues to state that the nation’s central bank keeps the interest rates too high and urged for another cut. Unlike the previous similar occasions, though, he was rather radical this time, claiming that the Federal Reserve needs to slash the rates by at least three points. First, President Trump mentions that higher rates are costing the US more money on interest expense. At a high level, this is true. Annual interest expense on US debt has reached $1.2 TRILLION over the last 12 months. The US is now paying $3.3 BILLION in interest per day. pic.twitter.com/22N9M2PdFX — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) July 9, 2025 According to the Kobeissi Letter, the US now pays well over $3 billion in interest alone per day. If Trump’s recommendation is followed by the Fed, then, he said, it would save $360 billion per year. However, the analysts at Kobeissi said the only debt that matters is the public one, which is at around $29 billion. Their analysis claims that if the rates on that entire amount are cut by 300 bps, the “US could save $290B x 3 = $870B/year.” “However, refinancing all of this debt immediately would be impossible. Realistically, 20% could be refinanced in year 1 to save ~$174B.” Although these numbers sound promising, there are certain drawbacks to such a potential rate cut, especially when it comes to inflation. It would be three times bigger than the current record seen in March 2020, when the Fed reduced the rates by 100bps. This would come with a US economy that is already growing at +3.8% YoY. As a result, we would expect to see a resurgence in CPI inflation, likely exceeding 5%. And, while it would initially send stocks higher as seen in March 2020, there’s no such thing as “free money.” pic.twitter.com/K5vRmp8Ay8 — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) July 9, 2025 The Kobeissi Letter further warned that mortgage rates would drop from 7% to 4% into a market that “has already seen prices rise +50% since 2020.” The analysts suggested that prices can surge by another 25%. Nevertheless, such a move should be highly beneficial for riskier assets like bitcoin. The cryptocurrency’s price is up by around 1% in the past day, and since Trump’s recommendation, it now stands close to $110,000. BTCUSD.

2025-07-09T18:43:08,"Why Are Bitcoin and Altcoins No Longer Responding to Donald Trump’s Tariff Threats? Here Are Expert Opinions","While Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP and Solana finished the day with slight increases today, the US's renegotiation with some of its foreign trade partners did not affect the crypto market much. However, according to analysts, despite these positive developments, cryptocurrencies are still stuck in a narrow price range. Bitcoin, for example, has traded largely between $107,000 and $110,000 in recent weeks. It’s up only 1.5% in the last 30 days, but it’s still close to its all-time high. Ethereum has been trading sideways at $2,500 for about a month, while Solana has also been stable around $150. The decline in cryptocurrencies following the “retaliatory tariffs” announced by US President Donald Trump in April contrasts with the recent stability. Some investors are struggling to understand why the market remains resilient despite Trump’s latest tariff threats. But analysts say this is not surprising. Experts say investors are less responsive to the US’s three-time postponement of negotiation deadlines and are more inclined to position themselves against macroeconomic uncertainty, allowing crypto assets to remain elevated despite the uncertainty. Related News: The Founder's Past Posts Have Surfaced in a Widely-Discussed Altcoin: Causing a Major Debate Trump sent official letters on Monday to 14 countries, including Japan, South Korea and Thailand, warning them that he would impose aggressive tariffs. The tariffs, ranging from 25% to 40%, are expected to go into effect on August 1. However, a possible delay is also on the agenda. Options analyst Bret Kenwell said investors believe Trump will delay the Aug. 1 tax cuts, which has even become the subject of a memecoin called “Trump Always Chickens Out.” “If there is confidence that negotiations will continue or the deadline will be extended, the market may continue to ignore such headlines,” Kenwell said. He also noted that any pullbacks would be viewed as buying opportunities for investors, which could pull prices back into the current range. Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said investors have become accustomed to Trump’s volatile trade negotiations and are now more resilient to such macro developments. Magadini also noted that institutional investors have been hedging their exposure to BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) over the past seven months with options trading. Under this strategy, investors buy into the IBIT ETF, sell call options on it to generate income, and buy protective put options to reduce risk. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-09T18:10:34,"Bitcoin Whales Unleash Accumulation: A Critical Divide in Investor Confidence","Ever wondered what the true pulse of the Bitcoin market is? While headlines often focus on price fluctuations, the real story often unfolds behind the scenes, within the blockchain itself. Recent insights from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode reveal a fascinating and critical divergence in investor behavior: Bitcoin whales are quietly accumulating, while many smaller retail holders appear to be selling off their holdings. This stark contrast paints a vivid picture of current market sentiment and raises important questions about confidence levels across different investor tiers. Let’s dive deep into what this on-chain data signifies for the future of Bitcoin. Decoding the Behavior of Bitcoin Whales When we talk about Bitcoin whales , we’re referring to entities holding substantial amounts of BTC – typically 1,000 to 10,000 BTC, and sometimes even more. These are often institutional investors, high-net-worth individuals, or long-term holders with deep pockets and a long-term vision. According to Glassnode’s recent observations shared on X, these large players have been steadily increasing their Bitcoin stash. This isn’t just a random fluctuation; it’s a consistent pattern of accumulation, suggesting a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s future value, even amidst price volatility. What drives this behavior? Whales often have access to sophisticated market analysis, a higher risk tolerance, and the ability to ride out short-term downturns, viewing them as opportunities to buy at a discount. Their accumulation patterns are often seen as a bullish signal. If those with the most capital are buying, it implies they foresee significant upside potential. This isn’t to say their actions are infallible, but they certainly carry weight in the market narrative. It suggests a strategic play, possibly anticipating future demand, broader institutional adoption, or a long-term appreciation in Bitcoin’s value as a digital store of value. Why Are Retail Holders Selling Their Bitcoin? On the flip side, Glassnode’s data points to a different trend among smaller investors, specifically those holding between 1 and 10 BTC, often categorized as retail holders . These groups have shown a tendency to sell off their Bitcoin. This behavior could stem from several factors. For many retail investors, short-term price movements can trigger emotional responses. A dip in price might lead to panic selling, or perhaps they’re taking profits after a recent rally, aiming to de-risk or reallocate funds. Economic pressures, such as inflation or rising interest rates, might also compel some to liquidate assets to meet immediate financial needs. Another perspective is that some retail holders might be moving their assets off exchanges, or consolidating them into fewer wallets, which could appear as ‘selling’ from a specific wallet group’s perspective, though Glassnode’s methodology usually accounts for such movements. However, the prevailing interpretation points to a genuine reduction in holdings for this segment. This contrast in behavior highlights a clear divergence in confidence and strategy between the seasoned, deep-pocketed investors and the broader individual investor base. What Does This Market Sentiment Divide Imply? The stark difference in behavior between Bitcoin whales and retail holders provides crucial insights into current market sentiment . When whales accumulate, it often indicates a long-term bullish outlook. They are “buying the dip” or simply adding to their positions, confident that Bitcoin’s value will increase over time. Their actions can act as a stabilizing force, absorbing selling pressure from smaller investors. Conversely, the selling by retail holders can reflect a more cautious, fearful, or short-term opportunistic mindset. It might signal a lack of conviction, a need for liquidity, or simply a reaction to FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) in the market. This divide suggests that while the foundational belief in Bitcoin’s long-term potential remains strong among large entities, there’s a degree of uncertainty or short-term profit-taking occurring among smaller participants. Understanding this dynamic is key for anyone trying to gauge the underlying health and direction of the cryptocurrency market. Leveraging On-Chain Data for Informed Decisions This is where the power of on-chain data comes into play. Firms like Glassnode analyze publicly available information on the blockchain – every transaction, every wallet balance, every movement of coins. By aggregating and interpreting this data, they can identify patterns and trends that are invisible through traditional market analysis methods, which often focus solely on price and volume from exchanges. On-chain metrics provide a unique “x-ray vision” into the fundamental supply and demand dynamics of Bitcoin. They allow us to see not just what is being traded, but who is trading it, and in what quantities. For investors, this means gaining a deeper understanding of genuine accumulation or distribution phases. Instead of relying purely on news headlines or price charts, on-chain data offers a more robust, transparent, and often less emotional perspective on investor conviction. It helps distinguish between short-term noise and long-term structural shifts in market behavior. Identifying Accumulation Zones: On-chain data can help pinpoint periods where large entities are actively buying. Gauging Investor Confidence: By observing the net flow of coins into or out of different wallet sizes, one can infer the overall sentiment of various investor groups. Spotting Supply Shocks: Understanding how much Bitcoin is being held in long-term wallets versus short-term trading wallets can indicate potential supply shortages or gluts. Navigating the Challenges of On-Chain Analysis While incredibly powerful, interpreting on-chain data isn’t without its challenges. It requires a nuanced understanding of various metrics and their context. For instance, a single large transaction could represent an internal wallet transfer by an exchange, rather than a genuine sale or purchase by an investor. Analysts must employ sophisticated techniques to filter out such noise and accurately identify meaningful trends. Moreover, on-chain data provides insights into supply-side dynamics, but it doesn’t account for all market drivers. Macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, technological developments, and broader geopolitical events also play significant roles in shaping Bitcoin’s price. Therefore, on-chain analysis should be used as one powerful tool in a comprehensive analytical toolkit, rather than the sole determinant of investment decisions. Actionable Insights for Your Bitcoin Strategy So, what does this divergence mean for you, the individual investor? Firstly, it reinforces the idea that conviction is key. While retail investors might be swayed by short-term price movements, the steady accumulation by whales suggests a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. This doesn’t mean you should blindly follow the whales, but it does provide a perspective that encourages a longer-term outlook rather than panic selling during dips. Secondly, it highlights the importance of doing your own research. While Glassnode’s data is invaluable, understanding your own financial goals and risk tolerance is paramount. Consider a dollar-cost averaging strategy to mitigate the impact of volatility, rather than trying to time the market perfectly. Finally, embrace the transparency of the blockchain. Tools and analyses derived from on-chain data can empower you to make more informed decisions, moving beyond speculative narratives to understand the underlying movements of Bitcoin’s supply and demand. By paying attention to these fundamental shifts, you can better position yourself in a volatile yet promising market. Conclusion: A Tale of Two Investor Worlds The latest revelations from Glassnode paint a compelling picture of the current Bitcoin landscape: a clear and critical divide between the confident accumulation of Bitcoin whales and the cautious selling by many retail holders . This divergence in market sentiment , uncovered through meticulous on-chain data analysis, underscores the varying perspectives and strategies at play. While small investors may be reacting to short-term pressures, the consistent buying by large entities signals a profound belief in Bitcoin’s enduring value proposition. This powerful insight serves as a reminder that understanding the fundamental movements of coins on the blockchain is essential for truly grasping the market’s pulse. As Bitcoin continues its journey, monitoring these on-chain dynamics will remain crucial for discerning its true trajectory.

2025-07-09T18:03:09,"Solana  ETFs See $78M Inflows as Interest in Altcoin Investment Products Grows","Three Solana-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) listed in the U.S. have quietly pulled in $78 million over the past month, reflecting rising interest in altcoin-backed investment products despite the outsized dominance of bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) in ETF markets. The Solana REX-Osprey SOL + Staking ETF (SSK), which launched July 2, has already attracted over $41 million in assets under management, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Meanwhile, Volatility Shares’ leveraged Solana ETF (SOLT) has accumulated $69 million year-to-date, and its regular Solana ETF (SOLZ) holds $23 million. “It’s all much smaller than btc or eth but lot of green numbers = good,” Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote in a post on X. The inflows come as several asset managers prepare for what they hope will be the next major crypto ETF approval: a spot Solana fund that includes staking rewards. While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to approve such a product, industry analysts are increasingly optimistic. Earlier this week, CoinDesk reported that the SEC requested issuers re-file key documents by the end of July, signaling a potentially faster timeline than the October deadline originally anticipated. If so, solana (SOL) would join bitcoin and ether as one of the few cryptocurrencies available to U.S. investors through spot ETFs. The bitcoin ETFs, launched in January, have drawn nearly $50 billion in capital, transforming the market for digital assets and placing BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) among the top revenue-generating funds of any kind. IBIT alone now holds 700,000 BTC . Ethereum ETFs, which were approved more recently, have pulled in about $4.5 billion so far.

2025-07-09T17:41:42,"Best Crypto to Buy As Ethereum Accumulation Rises - Altcoin Season Next?","Ethereum has been unusually quiet, and that silence is starting to look deliberate. For several weeks now, ETH has hovered around the $2500 mark with little deviation, absorbing volatility while volumes steadily rise. That kind of stability, especially in a token known for wide swings, signals preparation rather than hesitation. Institutional activity has picked up considerably. Spot transactions are growing heavier, and on-chain metrics point to a steady surge in interest, not just from retail but from long-term allocators as well. The market seems to be watching ETH with a kind of controlled anticipation, and that attention has a direction. Ethereum’s Shift from Store to Engine and What That Means for the Rest of the Market In the last few weeks, two publicly listed companies have made massive moves into ETH. Bit Digital, a Nasdaq-traded firm, sold off its Bitcoin reserves and converted over $200 million into ETH, stating openly that Ethereum’s yield structure and long-term financial utility aligned better with its strategy. They swapped all of their BTC for ETH 😮This makes @BitDigital_BTBT the 3rd largest ETH holder as a publicly traded company ($250M+ worth). pic.twitter.com/fBmjqYS21u — FOMO HOUR (@fomohour) July 8, 2025 Around the same time, SharpLink Gaming added over 200,000 ETH to its treasury and staked the entire amount. Both firms raised additional capital from public markets specifically to increase their Ethereum holdings. These are not minor portfolio shifts. They reflect a structural bet on ETH as a productive, programmable asset rather than a speculative one. ⚡️BIG: SharpLink Gaming has purchased 7,689 $ETH worth $19.2 million, increasing its total Ethereum holdings to 205,634 $ETH . This makes @SharpLinkGaming (NASDAQ: $SBET ) the largest publicly traded $ETH holder and shows its aggressive buying strategy as institutional demand… pic.twitter.com/Wf794A2OSU — Crypto Coin Show (@CryptoCoinShow) July 9, 2025 What makes this more significant is the timing. Ethereum has remained steady around the $2500 level while trading volume continues to rise. Liquidity has also returned in the form of ERC-20 stablecoins, which just hit a record $121 billion in supply. These are conditions that typically set the floor for a wider altcoin breakout. Ethereum’s consolidation, coupled with rising participation and large-scale repositioning by major players, is laying the groundwork. And when ETH becomes the magnet, altcoins do not need to ask for attention, they just need to be close enough to catch the spillover. That season is not here yet, but the air has changed. The capital is waiting, and the rotation could begin the moment ETH makes its next real move. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Tokens That Could Pump As the Altcoin Season Approaches Snorter Snorter is built for how crypto is actually used, not how it is marketed. Its core utility lies in its deep integration with Telegram, which remains the most active layer of crypto communication today. Rather than forcing users to adopt a new interface or switch platforms, Snorter embeds an entire analytical and executional framework within a space traders and community members already trust. It handles everything from wallet scanning to sentiment tracking to trade execution, all through conversational prompts inside Telegram chats. This kind of embedded design does not just reduce friction. It changes the speed of action. Users no longer need to move between tools, copy-paste data, or rely on third-party dashboards. Everything flows in real time, inside the conversation. The bot is fast, adaptable, and transparent in its logic, which matters more as noise returns to the market. SNORT was also dubbed to be one of the highest potential presales to consider investing in by top creators and YouTubers like ClayBro and many others, further adding to its popularity. If Ethereum’s current steadiness does lead to a renewed rotation into altcoins, the attention will not be quiet. Snorter is made for that kind of environment. It does not rely on a token pump or abstract hype. Its appeal lies in clarity and control, which become more valuable when volatility returns. As users re-engage, they are likely to choose tools that keep them rooted in the places they already operate from. Snorter sits exactly in that pocket. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper exists to serve a different demand; one grounded in Bitcoin’s base layer but unhindered by its limitations. Built as a Layer 2 network specifically for Bitcoin, Hyper enables smart contracts, low-fee transactions, and application-level programmability without moving away from Bitcoin’s core security and settlement structure. This makes it a functional extension rather than a departure. The logic behind it is straightforward. Bitcoin is often framed as digital gold, but gold cannot process a microtransaction, power a decentralized app, or offer smart execution conditions. Hyper introduces that missing logic while keeping BTC at the center. It is not trying to compete on ecosystem size. It is building a parallel utility set that speaks to Bitcoin’s own user base. The timing is relevant. As Ethereum continues to attract institutional holders and redefine itself as a foundational financial asset, capital is likely to look for complementary systems rather than pure alternatives. Bitcoin Hyper fits into that landscape precisely because it does not ask users to abandon BTC. It simply gives them a way to do more with it. If liquidity begins to flow more widely, protocols that offer this kind of practical expansion will likely stand out, not because they promise more, but because they unlock what was previously restricted. SUBBD SUBBD is structured around creators, not tokens. It does not depend on speculative traction or narrative cycles. Instead, it offers a model where content ownership, discovery, and monetization are built into the system itself. Unlike traditional platforms that control reach and revenue through opaque algorithms, SUBBD allows creators to embed access rules, membership layers, and monetization logic directly into their work using smart contracts. This approach turns each creator into their own ecosystem. Whether it is video, writing, audio, or niche community content, the rules are written by the creator and enforced by the platform’s underlying protocol. This creates consistency in experience and revenue without forcing users or creators into subscription silos or ad-based engagement loops. SUBBD is not trying to rebuild social media. It is building a content economy from the creator upward.

They provide application-level proof of what on-chain logic can do outside of finance. If an altcoin cycle begins to take shape, the market will likely reward projects that demonstrate actual embedded utility and content remains one of the most defensible and scalable categories for that kind of use. SUBBD operates there with precision. Best Wallet Best Wallet is not built for speculation. It is designed for everyday crypto use, and that distinction changes how it functions. At its core, it is a multi-chain Web3 wallet that handles asset storage, transaction execution, token discovery, and dApp access in one continuous interface. The layout is clean, but more importantly, the experience is intentional. Navigation feels immediate. Tasks that are typically segmented- like bridging assets, interacting with staking pools, or participating in presales are streamlined into processes that feel native. The strength of Best Wallet lies in its architecture. It does not treat networks like compartments. It allows users to move across Ethereum, Solana, and other major ecosystems without technical barriers. For those entering the market now, that kind of flexibility is essential. The focus has shifted from holding assets to interacting with them, and wallets need to reflect that shift. As Ethereum consolidates and altcoin attention begins to re-emerge, users will need tools that make participation seamless. That includes managing multiple assets, navigating early-stage launches, and verifying smart contract permissions without relying on clunky workarounds. Best Wallet meets that need with actual infrastructure, not marketing features. If a new cycle builds from the base Ethereum is laying down, the tools that manage and extend that access will play a central role. Best Wallet positions itself there; not as a gateway, but as a full system for interaction. That positioning may prove valuable as user activity returns. Conclusion As Ethereum continues to consolidate and institutional alignment grows stronger, the market is beginning to shift its posture. What was once a scattered field of speculation is becoming a more focused search for function. If this trend continues and an altcoin season does unfold, it will not reward noise; it will reward readiness. The assets discussed above each reflect a different layer of that logic. Some enhance user access, some extend existing networks, and others introduce entirely new models of interaction. What unites them is timing. They are not waiting for a trend. They are built for the conditions that may arrive once the next phase begins. That alone makes them worth watching now. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

BTCI is best suited for income-focused investors comfortable with volatility but is not appropriate for the risk-averse given the potential for rapid declines. Written by Nick Ackerman, co-produced by Stanford Chemist NEOS is an ETF sponsor that has been bringing some unique ETFs to the market. One of those is the NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF ( BTCI ), launched toward the end of 2024. This is a relatively newer fund, but the idea is rather simple: the fund holds cash equivalents and Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) exposure through an ETF and long call options while it also writes call options against Bitcoin futures. The fund is actively managed with a ""data-driven call option strategy."" By writing call options, this provides the fund with option premiums, which can be distributed to investors. I believe this fund is rather risky overall and definitely not for those risk-averse investors. However, someone who is interested in investing in Bitcoin and wants high distribution could find it an interesting idea. BTCI Basics Dividend Frequency: Monthly. Dividend Yield: 2.10% SEC yield, 30.25% Distribution Yield. Expense Ratio: 0.98%. Leverage: N/A. Managed Assets: $345.1 million. Structure: Active ETF. BTCI's investment objective is to ""generate high monthly income with the potential for appreciation based on exposure to exchange-traded products (""ETP"") that have direct exposure to Bitcoin. They continue with seeking ""to distribute monthly income generated from writing call options on Bitcoin Futures ETFs."" The fund is actively managed and ""seeks to offer upside potential via efficient exposure to Bitcoin ETPs."" Despite a relatively short history of coming to market only on October 17, 2024, the fund has garnered much interest, and AUM has risen rapidly. Generally, a high distribution rate can cause a lot of attention. The popularity of Bitcoin also appears to be growing, thanks to its very strong returns as well. Of course, we know that is history, and past performance is no guarantee of future results. So, make of that what you will. BTCI's Portfolio BTCI's portfolio is quite simple, as it tends to be for this single-asset ETF offering. They hold VanEck Bitcoin ETF ( HODL ) as their more straightforward exposure to Bitcoin; however, it can get a bit more complicated with the options positioning. This is because they go long and short Bitcoin call options as well as short puts. Overall, the fund holds the highest allocation to U.S. Treasury Bills.

Because the Fund’s exposure to the Bitcoin Futures ETF is obtained via options instead of owning the reference asset, the Fund’s exposure is considered to be “synthetic.” The synthetic exposure is created through the combination of purchasing call options and selling put options generally at the same strike price with the same expiration. This combination synthetically creates the upside and downside participation in the price returns of the Bitcoin Futures ETF. The Fund will primarily gain exposure to increases in value experienced by the Bitcoin Futures ETF through the purchase of call options. As a buyer of these options, the Fund pays a premium to the seller of the options. The Fund will primarily gain exposure to decreases in value experienced by the Bitcoin Futures ETF through the sale of put options. As the seller of these options, the Fund receives a premium from the buyer of the options. In combination, the purchased call and sold put options generally provide exposure to price returns of the Bitcoin Futures ETF both on the upside and downside. Performance And Distribution The fund offers an extremely high distribution rate of ~30% so far. As long as Bitcoin can continue to have a strong run, this fund could actually achieve that type of return. As we can see, the fund has delivered market-beating returns against both equities and fixed income—this is by a huge margin too. The market price was $50 at launch and is now closer to $60, indicating that there has been some appreciation on top of the high distribution rate. YCharts However, I believe there is considerable risk in investing in Bitcoin as it can be quite a volatile asset. In fact, that's generally why the distribution rate can be so high, as the volatility increases, the option premiums are brought in. For example, the fund utilizes writing options (and goes long) with the CBOE Mini Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index, which has an implied volatility of around 35% on the $250 call. CBOE Mini Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index (Fidelity) For some context, the implied volatility for the SPDR® S&P 500® ETF ( SPY ) for the first call strike below the current trading price is at ~17%. By writing those calls, the fund generates the cash flow provided by collecting the premiums and distributing them through a monthly distribution. Given the high allocation to U.S. Treasury Bills, that's also generating some interest payments within the fund. BTCI Distribution History (Seeking Alpha) Basically, that is where the 30-day SEC Yield of 2.10% is coming in while the fund's distribution rate is listed at 30.25% currently on the fund's website. BTCI Distribution and Expenses (NEOS) However, there is some downside to the fund utilizing options writing to generate the cash for the distribution. It comes with the risk that all call writing funds have to contend with, and that is the upside cap when an underlying investment is running sharply higher. This cap can get hit, and it can mean that the fund can limit its upside. In fact, the fund's latest semi-annual report for an abbreviated period showed that the fund saw realized losses from the written option contracts. BTCI Semi-Annual Report (NEOS) That's where you can see that BTCI has actually underperformed its ETF holding, HODL, by quite a meaningful margin. YCharts However, there can be some potential downside protection with a call writing strategy. It isn't much, but the premiums received offset declines in the underlying instruments that BTCI is long as well. In a flat market, BTCI would also be considered outperforming, as even if the underlying is moving sideways, those premiums can still be collected for some gains. One fund I hold that is in the Bitcoin space, while also paying a monthly distribution, is ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ). The fund has outperformed BTCI during this period since the ETF's inception. YCharts However, the fund invests in futures and swaps for its Bitcoin exposure. It also doesn't utilize an options writing strategy, but the distributions come from the gains (and interest payments from the underlying Treasury holdings) produced on those derivatives. If those gains stopped, the distribution would fall dramatically—closer to the yield on Treasury Bills minus the 0.95% expense ratio. That's why you'll see the distribution history looks like this: BITO Distribution History (Seeking Alpha) As a more income-focused investor, I definitely prefer BITO and BTCI compared to holding a Bitcoin ETF or holding Bitcoin itself. I'm aware of not participating as much in the overall total returns. However, I find peace of mind, and that it is beneficial to have these gains/income distributed out monthly. If there is a collapse in Bitcoin, then I know some gains will be locked in or losses limited. Conclusion BTCI is a risky strategy as Bitcoin is considered quite volatile. At the same time, it has performed extremely well, and that has meant a lot of investor interest is being driven in that direction. BTCI provides exposure to Bitcoin either through ETFs or synthetically with options; it then applies an options writing strategy over the portfolio, which provides a significant monthly distribution to investors. High distributions tend to gain a lot of investor interest, so it might not be too surprising to see how fast this ETF is seeing inflows. However, I would reiterate that it does not appear to be appropriate for more risk-averse investors. The fund has experienced significant appreciation thanks to strong gains from Bitcoin, but such strong gains will not be guaranteed going forward. April of this year provided a good example of how far Bitcoin and this ETF can fall quite rapidly.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800204-btci-squeezing-30-percent-distribution-yield-from-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|REGULATION|MARKET","BTC-USD|HODL|SPY|BITO|BTCI",cryptocompare

While the broader market coughed up a 2.7% loss in the last 24 hours, the frog went ballistic again – pumping 10.1% and extending a win streak that’s starting to feel like muscle memory. In the past week alone, WEPE has pushed over $2.4 million in DEX volume – wild numbers for a sub-$10 million market cap coin that launched without a VC sugar daddy or influencer handouts. To put it in degenerate context, that’s nearly six times Jordan Belfort’s infamous $420,000 ‘business expense’ in a single month – and WEPE didn’t need expensive champagne or sides to pull it off. Just a clean chart, community conviction, and the kind of liquidity whales pretend not to notice until it’s already 5x. But what’s been fueling even more attention lately is the NFT collection the team’s been teasing across socials, plus the ongoing success of its private trading group, Alpha Chat. It all shows one thing: the spirit behind this project isn’t fading – it’s gaining fire. And the fight against the whales? It’s only getting louder. https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/wall-street-pepe The Market Wobbled, but WEPE’s NFT Army Tightened Its Tie and Hit Mint Mode Before market uncertainty crept in – thanks to tariff man POTUS Donald Trump jumping back into the headlines – WEPE had already stacked a 370% gain in just one month. Even with the slight pullback that followed, the token is still up over 102% in the past two weeks, holding firm while most of the market trips over itself. A big part of that? The 5,000-piece NFT collection the team’s been teasing, with 1,000 free mints reserved for holders that it announced on Sunday.

But this time, it’s not some boiler room scam. The collection is for the community, and it’s set to strengthen the army behind one of the grittiest meme coins in the game – one chest-thumping NFT at a time. And that army is not just watching from the sidelines. Inside WEPE’s Alpha Chat, members have landed gains between 500% to 1,000% – turning signals into action and fueling the kind of belief that keeps charts moving and buyers coming back. Something Bigger May Be Brewing But here’s another signal for the community: those watching closely have picked up on what might be next. A brand-new website is now in the works – likely a move to match the energy and growth the project’s been seeing. A sharper front-end signals a sharper phase, and WEPE’s not in the habit of doing things halfway. New site loading. New era brewing.

2025-07-09T17:20:28,"Bitcoin Starts Surging Toward $110K After Trump Says 'Fed Rate' Is 300 Basis Points Too High","Bitcoin surged to $109,343 on July 9, up 0.8% over the prior 24 hours, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. In a Truth Social post at 10:00 a.m. ET, Trump declared that the U.S. federal funds rate is “at least 3 points too high,” referring to a 300 basis point (3%) cut. He argued that delaying such a move imposes an annual burden of $360 billion on refinancing costs. Within 30 minutes, BTC began rising steadily as traders appeared to price in the short-term implications of such a dramatic policy shift, including the potential for renewed liquidity and risk-on sentiment. In a comprehensive thread on X , macro analysts at The Kobeissi Letter provided a detailed breakdown of Trump’s claim. According to their analysis, total U.S. interest payments have already reached $1.2 trillion over the past 12 months—equivalent to $3.3 billion per day. They noted that while Trump’s math assumes $360 billion in savings per percentage point across $36 trillion in national debt, only about $29 trillion is held publicly and would be affected by rate changes. Under more realistic assumptions, they estimate that a full 300 bps cut applied gradually could reduce interest expense by roughly $174 billion in the first year, potentially totaling $2.5 trillion over five years if 20% of the debt is refinanced annually. Despite these potential savings, the report warned that the broader economic consequences of a 3% cut would be historic. No single Fed rate cut in modern history has exceeded 100 basis points — even during the 2008 crisis or the March 2020 emergency move. Implementing a 300 bps reduction outside of a recession, in an economy growing at 3.8% annually, would be unprecedented. The Kobeissi Letter cautioned that such a move would likely reignite inflation above 5%, trigger a steep drop in the U.S. dollar — potentially exceeding 10% — and cause housing prices to surge due to a sharp decline in mortgage rates. Asset markets would likely rally in the short term, with gold forecasted to hit $5,000, oil above $80 per barrel, and the S&P 500 breaching 7,000. However, they emphasized that the long-term consequences would be destabilizing without major reductions in U.S. government spending. For Bitcoin, the implications are clear: a sudden drop in interest rates would be viewed as monetary stimulus, likely accelerating capital inflows into hard assets and alternative stores of value like BTC. While analysts continue to debate the likelihood of such cuts, the market's immediate reaction suggests investors are positioning for upside risk. Technical Analysis Highlights The BTC price moved sharply within 30 minutes of Trump’s Truth Social post at 10:00 a.m. ET. Consolidation persisted earlier in the day, but buying volume increased significantly after Trump’s rate comments. Price tested resistance near $109,761, with higher lows forming above $108,500, indicating bullish structure. Bollinger Bands compressed to their tightest levels in this cycle, historically a signal of pending breakout. Institutional accumulation remains visible via volume clusters near support zones around $108,500–$108,600.

Hackers are abusing the op_return function to embed messages in transactions, creating a new form of phishing. As BTC trades near record levels, old wallets are looking ever more attractive. Attackers are attempting a new type of phishing by abusing the op_return function on Bitcoin. Using op_return allows the embedding of information in each BTC transaction. This function was also used to create Bitcoin-based NFTs. Scammers are generating messages that spoof official-looking sites, claiming ownership of the wallet. The message can do nothing to move the coins, but it can urge some users to take action. Some messages embedded in transactions point to sites or forms. Others attempt to claim ownership of the wallet, as in previous cases that tried to exploit older whales. The attempts at scamming owners mostly targeted whale wallets from the 2011 era. Mt. Gox hacker wallet receives spoof transactions One of the most targeted wallets belongs to the Mt. Gox Hacker, containing 79.95K BTC valued at over $8B. The wallet was last dusted on July 5, 2025, though it received additional tracing transactions or messages in the past. None of the coins in the wallet has been moved. One of the transactions from July 3, 2025, contained an op_return message pointing to an ‘owner notice’. The notice, when decoded, called the wallet holder to visit a site claiming to be linked to Salomon Brothers, a known Wall Street firm that was acquired by Citigroup in 2003 and no longer exists as a legal entity. Since July 3, the spoof site has been taken down. But before that, the message suggested that a third party attempted to claim possession of the wallet in legal terms. The claim via op_return, sent to the wallet, resembled the attempts of Calvin Ayre to prove ownership of old wallets. Scammers gather data or attempt pseudo-legal claims Some of the links sent in the op_return message attempt to gather personal data or connect a wallet to a real identity. So far, legal claims against inactive wallets have been unsuccessful, as BTC ownership hinges on holding private keys. Neither miners nor developers can claw back the BTC from idle wallets, despite claims of ownership. However, knowing the identity of old whales, if extracted through phishing, could lead to other types of attacks, such as kidnapping or attempting to steal private keys. Interest in old wallets increased after a whale with coins from 2011 moved 80,000 BTC to new addresses in a single day. Some of the initial whale wallets immediately received dust transactions containing spoofed op_return messages with pseudo-legal language. A recently emptied whale wallet received an op_return message claiming ownership over the wallet, embedded in a dust transaction. | Source: Blockchain.com One of the messages read ‘ LEGAL NOTICE: We have taken possession of this wallet and its contents ’. However, the actual wallet was emptied, and the coins were controlled by a new owner, with no further need for a legal claim. The cluster of dormant whale wallets also revealed that op_return attacks came in coordinated waves, potentially linked to a handful of bad actors making attempts to gather data or deploy other phishing tools. Attacks via op_return messages may stop after a Bitcoin upgrade, as there are proposals to limit the data threshold to just 80 bytes, not allowing even short messages.

2025-07-09T17:14:10,"Bitcoin hovers near key breakout zone as XLM, RAY rally double digits","Bitcoin remained rangebound as bulls sought to hold the flagship cryptocurrency above the $109,000 mark. The broader digital asset market advanced in tandem, with total crypto market capitalisation up approximately 1.5% to $3.46 trillion by late Asian trading hours on Wednesday. Despite Bitcoin trading less than 3% below its all-time high, repeated failures to breach $110,000 have tempered short-term optimism. Still, sentiment remains firmly in the greed zone, with the Crypto Fear & Greed Index holding at 66, a sign that investors are continuing to position for a potential breakout into price discovery. While not yet in a full-fledged alt season, altcoins had started showing signs of momentum, with most major tokens trading in the green at the time of writing. Why is Bitcoin price stuck? Bitcoin has been trading between a tight range of $107,475 and $110,307 over the past week, with a number of market forces currently dictating price action. On the upside, anticipation of rate cuts and broader trade deals has underpinned bullish expectations. Analysts say traders are watching macro developments closely, particularly as the US moves toward finalising trade agreements with several major economies. Letters sent by former President Trump to various negotiating parties, reaffirming the August 1 deadline, have also been viewed as strategic pressure to speed up deals. A broader agreement is seen as risk-positive and could trigger inflows into both equities and crypto. Meanwhile, expectations of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve as early as September have further supported long positioning. Polymarket odds currently price a 50% chance of a September cut, with rising probabilities for multiple rate reductions this year. Such easing could reduce the attractiveness of bonds and drive capital into higher-risk assets like Bitcoin. There’s also the proposed Big Beautiful Bill, which is expected to expand liquidity across markets, potentially spilling over into crypto. From a technical standpoint, however, Bitcoin’s price continues to be squeezed between heavy sell-side liquidity near $110,000 and a support floor around $107,000. According to the liquidation heatmap, significant short liquidation levels are stacked between $110K and $114K, creating a dense resistance wall. These layered orders are absorbing bullish momentum and forcing frequent rejections at each test of the upper band. This resistance is not limited to intraday moves. The 1-week heatmap confirms that the liquidity build-up above $110,000 is a structural zone, formed over multiple sessions. To clear it, Bitcoin would likely require a combination of rising open interest and strong spot demand, factors that remain elusive amid broader market caution. Meanwhile, profit-taking activity remains elevated, especially during New York hours, as sellers step in to cap rallies near key resistance. Spot liquidity data shows intense exchange order-book activity around $110,000, with traders hesitant to chase breakouts amid macro uncertainty. At the same time, downside risk is being cushioned by aggressive buying below $107,000. Liquidation levels and bid interest in this zone suggest that bulls are actively defending lower levels, allowing Bitcoin to bounce quickly on dips. This has resulted in a tightly wound price structure, leaving the asset vulnerable to sharp, short-lived moves on both sides. Adding to the complexity is the role of the U.S. dollar. The DXY index recently fell to its lowest level since early 2022, with analysts noting that it’s now trading near historical support versus its 200-day and 365-day moving averages. CryptoQuant data shows that this zone has historically been favourable for Bitcoin, though the current price action has yet to reflect that trend. According to QuickTake blog contributor DarkFrost, as the dollar weakens, investors often rotate toward alternative assets, a pattern that could fuel a delayed BTC rally. US Dollar Index (DXY) vs. BTC/USD. Source: CryptoQuant . “This tool serves as a valuable indicator for identifying early bull market phases and periods of euphoria, not because of pure technical triggers, but because it reflects increasing liquidity potentially flowing into crypto markets,” DarkFrost explained. What’s next for Bitcoin? Most market analysts were bullish on Bitcoin’s short- to mid-term outlook, though expectations remained measured. Many see the current chop as a reset before trend continuation, with several chart watchers flagging key signals that could confirm the next major move. According to trader BitBull, Bitcoin’s 3-day Relative Strength Index and price action were forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern, a classic bullish setup often seen ahead of major breakouts. In a post to X, he said a breakout would likely require one of two things: either a 3D close above $110K or an RSI breakout past 70.

Source: Jelle “#Bitcoin broke the bullish flag, retested it, and now pushes higher. Clear $110k, and $130k is the next target,” the analyst wrote on X. Veteran commentator The Crypto Monk similarly observed a “typical pattern” unfolding, one that he said often appears just before a breakout. The Crypto Monk @thecryptomonk · Follow $BTC is on the edge of breaking out. Typical pattern before shorts get shaken out! 6:07 PM · Jul 9, 2025 89 Reply Copy link Read 22 replies When writing, Bitcoin was hovering just above the $109,000 mark, up nearly 1% in the past 24 hours. Top altcoin gainers In the past 24 hours, the altcoin market saw a modest 1% rise, reaching $1.28 trillion, with about $18 million flowing in. The uptick coincided with a rise in the Altcoin Season Index from 22 to 27, hinting that more top 100 altcoins are starting to outpace Bitcoin. It’s a sign that investors might be slowly turning their attention away from the legacy crypto asset and showing renewed interest in the broader altcoin space. Ethereum, the leading altcoin by market capitalization, rose 3.5% over the past 24 hours to trade at $2,650. Other major altcoins, including XRP, Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA), also posted gains in the 2% to 5% range. Stellar (XLM) led the gains with a 15% rise on the day, followed by Raydium and SPX6900, which followed with gains of 11.8% and nearly 9%, respectively. Source: CoinMarketCap Stellar: XLM’s price picked up pace today after the Stellar Development Foundation released a new test version of its core software, marking a major step toward a pending upgrade to the Stellar blockchain scheduled for August. The upgrade is expected to improve how the network supports smart contracts and decentralized apps, making it faster and more scalable. Project-related developments tend to spark renewed investor interest, as they signal long-term growth potential. Raydium: Raydium’s recent price uptick can be attributed to the rapid expansion of BonkFun and LaunchLab, two integrated platforms that now form the core infrastructure for meme coin activity on the Solana network. BonkFun serves as the primary launchpad for new meme tokens, while LaunchLab manages token minting, liquidity provisioning, and volume routing, functions that are fully executed through Raydium’s platform. This combined setup now facilitates over half of Solana’s meme coin activity, generating approximately $900,000 in daily fees. Of that, an estimated $110,000 is consistently allocated to buy back RAY tokens from the market. Periodic buybacks tend to generate sustained buying pressure, which is likely supporting RAY’s current price action. SPX6900: The viral memecoin is extending its rally for a third straight day despite no clear catalyst, driven by strong community support and sustained grassroots momentum. With year-to-date gains nearing 400%, long-term holder confidence and retail backing continue to fuel the memecoin’s steady climb.

2025-07-09T17:14:01,"Strategy: The Rising Cost To Common Stockholders","Summary Strategy continues its aggressive capital raises via new preferred share ATMs, fueling ongoing Bitcoin purchases. Common stock dilution and rising preferred dividends are costs for shareholders, as annual preferred dividends now exceed $315 million. MSTR trades at a significant premium to its Bitcoin holdings, making direct Bitcoin or Bitcoin ETF exposure potentially more attractive. When you think of Bitcoin USD (BTC-USD), one of the first companies that comes to mind is MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ). Once a small software firm that was relatively unheard of, now the company is one of the leading holders of the world's most prominent cryptocurrency. As management has continued to find new ways to raise capital to purchase more Bitcoin, the costs are starting to rise for those that hold the common stock. Previous coverage of the name Back in March, I took a look at where things stood with the company after its first major issuance of preferred stock . I detailed the history of Bitcoin purchases from Strategy, along with its decision to issue preferred shares in addition to its common stock at-the-market (""ATM"") sales program in order to bring in fresh capital to buy more Bitcoin. Strategy shares have done quite well since my previous article, rallying almost 50%, whereas the S&P 500 has only gained about 11%. The large rally has been mostly due to a more than 30% rise in the value of Bitcoin, which has led to a large gain in the value of the company's Bitcoin holdings. The surge in shares also may be due to investors betting on the potential for S&P 500 inclusion, which I'll discuss later. A new preferred stock ATM When I looked at Strategy back in March, the company had one class of preferred stock, called MicroStrategy Incorporated SERIES A PERP PF ( STRK ). This preferred class featured an 8% annual dividend, and the company filed an ATM to issue up to $21 billion in STRK shares. This value matches the current ongoing ATM of common shares that was established in early May, as detailed in the latest business update filing . Since my previous article, Strategy has come up with two additional classes of preferred shares, MicroStrategy Incorporated SER A PFD STK ( STRF ) and Strategy Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock ( STRD ). Both of these preferred classes each pay 10% annual dividends. An ATM program was launched for STRF back in May with a $2.1 billion value, and just this week, the STRD shares saw a $4.2 billion ATM plan announced . As of July 6th, between the four outstanding share sale programs, Strategy could issue another nearly $45 billion worth of common and preferred stock. Preferred dividends are no longer immaterial As detailed in the business update linked above, each of the three preferred classes had more than 10 million shares outstanding at the end of June, with STRK having the most at a little more than 12.2 million. Given these numbers as well as their 8% and 10% respective annual dividend rates, the chart below shows how annual run rate dividend payments have risen since the start of these programs earlier this year. The numbers are based on the share counts at the end of each respective quarter. Strategy Preferred Stock Dividend Payments (Company Filings) From the end of Q1 to the end of Q2, the annual run rate went from roughly $146 million to $316 million. As the company has previously detailed , it has used the common stock ATM to raise money for dividend payments. Strategy only had around $60 million in cash at the end of Q1 according to its quarterly filing , while the above business update detailed over $8.2 billion in total debt at the end of June. The company really doesn't produce any meaningful free cash flow, and any cash it did generate was going to Bitcoin purchases. With a market cap of about $110 billion currently between its Class A and B common stock, dilution of more than $300 million a year to pay preferred dividends doesn't seem like that much. However, the number is certainly rising, as seen above, and it could be even more material if Strategy shares were to drop. Don't forget that the company is also paying commissions of up to 2% of the gross value of shares it sells to brokers, another cost of raising funds to purchase more Bitcoin. At the end of Q2, there were more than 261 million Class A shares outstanding, up almost 15 million during the quarter. As a reminder, this number was under 96 million at the end of 2022 before the company really started diluting investors. Trading at a premium valuation At the end of June, the total value of Strategy's two common share classes and its three preferred share classes was a little over $117 billion. At that time, the value of its Bitcoin holdings was about $64 billion. If we subtract out the three preferred classes, the value of the common shares came down to around $113.5 billion. That leaves a roughly $50 billion difference to its Bitcoin holdings value. The rest of the business is certainly not worth the remainder of that, given it is showing a large revenue decline currently and is expected to report less than half a billion dollars in software sales this year. Most software companies that show decent growth can go for about 10 times revenue, but those with limited growth or even declining revenues usually go for the low-to-mid-single digits. That means the software business is worth just a couple of billion dollars at most, so investors here are basically paying about 1.7 times the value of the company's Bitcoin pile. As a pure Bitcoin play, buying the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) would seemingly be the better option. I mentioned in my previous article that new accounting rules were set to allow the company to recognize gains related to its Bitcoin holdings, which would mean the potential to report large amounts of net income. Strategy reported a more than $14 billion unrealized gain on its digital assets in Q2. Reporting positive net income could allow the stock to become a member of the S&P 500 index, which should trigger a sizable amount of institutional borrowing. Some of the premium that Strategy shares trade at currently could be due to those betting that S&P 500 inclusion will come rather soon. Final thoughts and recommendation Strategy this week announced a third ATM program for preferred shares, allowing it to raise even more capital to fund its Bitcoin purchases. However, this comes with a rising cost, as preferred stock dividend payments are now running at a more than $300 million annual pace. Selling common stock is a one-time hit to shareholders in the form of dilution, but this preferred plan has a fixed cost each and every year. If Strategy completed all three of the current preferred stock ATMs, that would result in roughly $2.3 billion in annual dividend payments. At the moment, I continue to rate the common stock as a hold. If you are a long-term believer in Bitcoin, it seems likely that Strategy shares would rise over time, but you might be better off than just buying Bitcoin directly or through one of the ETFs like IBIT. I believe that Strategy is going to continue to sell a lot of shares to purchase more Bitcoin, which likely will provide a headwind to the possible upside here. Should we see Bitcoin prices hold steady or even head higher in the next few quarters, Strategy may be worth a speculative short-term buy then if you believe the S&P 500 committee will add it to the index. However, after that potentially positive catalyst, one must wonder if the premium shares trade at its Bitcoin holdings value will eventually compress.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800199-strategy-the-rising-cost-to-common-stockholders?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BUSINESS|BTC|STRK|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY","IBIT|MSTR|STRK|STRF|STRD",cryptocompare
2025-07-09T17:13:43,"Emirates to Accept Crypto Payments Via New Deal with Crypto.com","Emirates, the largest airline in the Middle East, is preparing to introduce cryptocurrency as a payment option for its customers. The airline’s parent company announced that it has signed a preliminary agreement with Crypto.com, a global digital currency trading platform. The deal is expected to take effect in 2026 and is part of the airline’s larger plan to adopt new technologies and offer more flexible payment choices. Emirates Embraces Crypto to Attract Next-Gen Travelers This new partnership with Crypto will allow Emirates passengers to pay for tickets and other services through the exchange’s payment system. By introducing crypto payments, Emirates aims to cater to a new generation of travelers accustomed to using digital currencies. These include young adults, remote workers, and tech-savvy customers who prefer fast and secure transactions without relying on traditional banks. The airline believes that this change will improve the overall travel experience. At the same time, attract more users who are already active in the digital economy. This move is also in line with a broader trend in the airline industry. Around the world, more airlines are starting to accept cryptocurrency to stay trendy and meet the changing needs of their customers. The UAE Is Becoming a Global Hub for Crypto Emirates’ decision comes at a time when the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is strengthening its role in the global digital asset market. The country has created a welcoming environment for crypto businesses , especially in Dubai. The government has introduced clear rules and systems to support the virtual asset industry. In 2022, Dubai launched the Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority, also known as VARA. This regulatory body is responsible for overseeing the cryptocurrency sector and ensuring that companies follow proper regulations. As a result, more than 650 crypto companies are now based in one of Dubai’s main business zones, the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC). These firms operate in various areas, including real estate, school payments, and transportation services. Most recently, Dubai’s Financial Services Authority (DFSA) approved QCDT, the first tokenized money market fund in the region. This move aims to strengthen the city’s role as a leader in digital finance and Web3 innovation. More Airlines Across the Region Are Adopting Crypto Emirates is not alone in its move toward digital currencies. In May, another airline in the region, Air Arabia, announced that it would start accepting cryptocurrency payments through a local digital currency. This coin, known as AE Coin, is backed by the UAE dirham and can be used to book flights. This shows that the use of digital currencies is becoming more common in the travel and airline industries. Airlines are seeing the benefits of offering their customers more modern, fast, and flexible payment options. As more people become familiar with cryptocurrency, an increasing number of airlines will likely follow this path.

2025-07-09T16:55:10,"US Dollar Resurgence May Be Around the Corner, According to Barclays Currency Strategist – Here’s Why: Report","US dollar resurgence could be just around the corner, according to an FX strategist at the banking giant Barclays. Skylar Montgomery Koning tells Bloomberg that the dollar has already priced in the negative impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs in its 10% drop year-to-date, noting that the greenback is primed to rise in value against foreign currencies. “The fact that some of the more problematic policies from the US administration have been dialed back – and there are deals getting done – means that the economic pain for the US won’t be as bad as originally feared.” The US dollar index (DXY) is trading at 97.57 at time of writing. The USD outlook of Barclays comes after the US dollar printed its worst first-half performance in over 50 years. The DXY plunged nearly 11% from January to June of this year, marking its steepest decline since the first six months of 1973 when the index dropped by 14.8%. Meanwhile, Kathy Jones, a chief fixed income strategist at the financial services giant Charles Schwab, tells Bloomberg Television that US trade policies and their resulting inflation could delay anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts until December or next year. Rate cuts tend to devalue the dollar. Conversely, the CME FedWatch Tool estimates there’s a 62.7% chance the Fed will cut the rate by 25 basis points at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in September.
