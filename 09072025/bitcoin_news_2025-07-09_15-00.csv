2025-07-09T12:50:06,"US Senate targets Bukele's El Salvador, bill calls to sanction BTC strategy","A group of Democratic senators has introduced a new bill that could impose sanctions on El Salvador’s leadership over its Bitcoin holdings and alleged human rights abuses. The legislation, titled the “El Salvador Accountability Act of 2025” (S. 2058), was brought before the US Senate by Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), alongside Senators Tim Kaine (D-VA) and Alex Padilla (D-CA). The bill is calling for the US to cut ties with President Nayib Bukele’s government , which became the first in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. Liberal senators claim Bitcoin in the country is being used in corruption, sanction evasion, and human rights violations. Democrats mandate a detailed US government report Under the provisions of “S. 2058,” the US Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, would be required to submit a report within 90 days of the bill’s enactment. The report must be released to appropriate congressional committees and question the Salvadoran government’s use of crypto. The report will analyze whether President Bukele and his officials have used digital assets “for gross corruption, graft, and evading US laws.” It would also examine the total amount of funds the government has spent purchasing Bitcoin, the exchanges used, wallet addresses, and the individuals who control these accounts. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA the Dems are just salty… https://t.co/O6CLtZuV46 — Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) July 8, 2025 Since 2021, Bukele’s government has aggressively accumulated digital assets , reportedly buying one Bitcoin per day and amassing a treasury of over 6,200 BTC. More queries will be made into the use of Bitcoin to evade international financial restrictions. The report must include an assessment of crypto being employed as a “vector to evade financial sanctions imposed on other entities,” through anonymous wallets . Other officials listed include the Vice President, Minister of Foreign Relations, Minister of Defense, Minister of Economy, and Minister of Finance. The sanctions would apply if there is credible evidence showing any of them were involved in suppressing civil liberties or aiding in illicit financial activities. One of the legal concerns raised by lawmakers is the government’s use of a “state of exception,” a law that allows for the temporary suspension of certain civil rights. According to the bill, such provisions have allegedly been misused to crack down on political dissent and civil society. US aid and political support to El Salvador under scrutiny In an interview with Fox News back in April, Democrat Representative Jamie Raskin (D-MD) said he was “frustrated” over continued American aid to El Salvador. Raskin questioned the Salvadoran government’s refusal to return Kilmar Garcia, a US citizen who was imprisoned in El Salvador. Kilmar Abrego Garcia was brought back to the United States from El Salvador on June 6, 2025, after being mistakenly deported in mid‑March. Raskin described the arrangement between the US and El Salvador as “dubious,” noting that Bukele has been receiving $6 million from America under a repatriation agreement . According to Raskin, this financial support implies legal authority, which Bukele allegedly refused to exercise by keeping Garcia in detention. “ You know, we should be talking about cutting off aid to El Salvador right now ,” Raskin said. “ The whole idea that Bukele doesn’t have any power to return an American prisoner… is ridiculous. He’s our legal agent. ” On July 7, a federal judge rejected the Justice Department’s attempt to dismiss Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s lawsuit over his mistaken deportation to El Salvador, calling one of the motions “meritless.” “You made three arguments, defendants, and none are availing… meritless,” US District Judge Paula Xinis told Justice Department attorney Bridget O’Hickey. The Salvadoran government has not formally addressed the detailed findings required by the US Senate’s bill, nor has it confirmed if it will cooperate with any investigations into its government’s crypto use.

2025-07-09T12:48:27,"Exploring the Impact of Global Trade Tensions on Cryptocurrency Markets","Recent actions by President Trump have once again brought the specter of a trade war into the global economic arena, impacting financial markets worldwide, including the realm of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Global Trade Uncertainty and Its Immediate Impact on Crypto Markets With President Trump's announcement of potential tariffs on several key trading partners, global markets experienced a downturn. The cryptocurrency market wasn't insulated from these events, as seen with Bitcoin's significant drop below $108,000, reflecting investor anxiety over the escalating trade tensions. How Bitcoin Reflects the Characteristics of a Risk Asset During Trade Wars As traditional markets took a hit, Bitcoin followed suit, demonstrating its increasing correlation with speculative assets rather than acting as a safe haven. This shift in perception is crucial for investors who traditionally viewed Bitcoin as digital gold. Technical Analysis and Market Reactions Following the unsettling news, Bitcoin's value saw a rapid decline to $107,936.08, after almost reaching a record high of $111,814. Market analysts are closely monitoring these movements, suggesting a potential trend where Bitcoin behaves similarly to tech stocks when faced with macroeconomic challenges.

Ross stated that the cryptocurrency markets are going through a strong consolidation process and argued that according to technical indicators, Bitcoin could rise to $170,000. “Bitcoin is currently a compressed spring. If the recent resistance level at $110,000 is broken, a rally to $140,000 and then $170,000 is expected,” Ross said.

2025-07-09T12:39:05,"US Dollar Index Declines Further, Could Bitcoin Be Gearing Up for a Breakout?","The United States dollar index (DXY) has been on a decline over the past four months, recording its largest plunge in years. Since such moves have historically been correlated with positive growth in risk assets, bitcoin (BTC) could be gearing up for a strong breakout. According to a report by the market analytics platform CryptoQuant, the correlation between a weak DXY and strong BTC has emerged multiple times in the past. DXY Is Still Falling With the U.S. debt hitting a new all-time high (ATH), the DXY has fallen to a historically weak level. The metric is currently trading around 6.5 points below its 200-day moving average. This marks its most significant deviation in the last 21 years. CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost said that such DXY dips , while initially alarming, tend to benefit risk assets like BTC. Such periods are mostly favorable for the primary cryptocurrency. They also signal early bull market phases and seasons of euphoria, as the market sees an influx of liquidity. This is because the dollar loses its safe-haven appeal and investors begin to turn to risk assets. “This is a well-known correlation in traditional finance. As the dollar weakens and loses its safe-haven appeal, investors reassess their portfolio allocations and shift capital toward alternative asset classes,” he stated. An Imminent Breakout for BTC? Although the market is currently in a phase where the weakness of the DXY could trigger a BTC rally, the price of the leading crypto asset is yet to react. BTC has been trading within a 10% range from $100,000 to $110,000 since the end of May. At the time of writing, the asset was worth $108,800, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Market experts have insisted that there needs to be an increase in liquidity and demand before BTC can begin and sustain a price rally. While there is still a risk of significant correction, some analysts believe the asset has a higher chance of surging. CryptoPotato reported yesterday that the bulls have structural control; hence, the underlying momentum during this consolidation phase is tilted to the bullish side. Regardless of bulls being in control, BTC still needs fresh catalysts or clearer macroeconomic signals to be able to rally to new highs.

2025-07-09T12:30:31,"Bitcoin Accumulation: H100 Group’s Bold $54M Investment Signals New Era","In a move that highlights the evolving landscape of corporate finance, a Swedish health tech firm is making waves in the crypto world. H100 Group, known for its innovations in health technology, has announced a significant funding round aimed squarely at a robust Bitcoin accumulation strategy. This decision by a company outside the traditional tech or finance sectors underscores a growing trend: mainstream industries are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a strategic asset. Why Are Companies Embracing Bitcoin Accumulation? For many, the idea of a health tech company diverting funds to Bitcoin might seem unconventional. However, the rationale behind Bitcoin accumulation by corporations is becoming clearer. It’s not just about speculation; it’s about strategic diversification and hedging against inflation. Companies are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a digital store of value, akin to digital gold, capable of preserving capital in an uncertain economic climate. The move signals a proactive approach to balance sheet management, seeking alternative assets that offer potential growth and protection against currency devaluation. The Details of H100 Group Investment H100 Group has successfully raised an additional $54 million through a combination of stock and convertible bond offerings. This substantial capital injection is specifically earmarked to bolster the company’s Bitcoin holdings. The decision to use a traditional financing mechanism like convertible bonds for a crypto-centric strategy is particularly noteworthy. It indicates a growing comfort level among investors and financial institutions in supporting ventures that integrate digital assets into their core financial plans. This significant H100 Group investment demonstrates a clear commitment to their long-term Bitcoin vision, setting a precedent for other non-crypto-native companies. Key aspects of the funding: Amount: $54 million Method: Stock and convertible bond offering Purpose: To fund a strategic Bitcoin (BTC) accumulation plan Understanding the Broader Corporate Bitcoin Strategy Trend H100 Group is not an isolated case. The adoption of Bitcoin as a treasury asset has been gaining momentum, driven by pioneers like MicroStrategy, which famously holds billions in BTC. Companies are exploring corporate Bitcoin strategy for various reasons, including: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature make it an attractive hedge against inflation, especially in an era of quantitative easing. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to the balance sheet can reduce overall portfolio risk and enhance returns. Innovation and Brand Positioning: Embracing Bitcoin can signal a forward-thinking approach, appealing to a new generation of investors and customers. Potential Upside: While volatile, Bitcoin offers significant growth potential that traditional assets might not. Here’s a look at some notable corporate Bitcoin holdings (as of various reports, numbers subject to change): Company Primary Industry Approx. BTC Held Strategy MicroStrategy Business Intelligence ~214,400 BTC Primary treasury reserve asset Tesla Automotive, Clean Energy ~9,720 BTC Treasury reserve, transaction enablement Marathon Digital Holdings Bitcoin Mining ~17,800 BTC Self-mined holdings Coinbase Cryptocurrency Exchange ~10,500 BTC Corporate treasury Hut 8 Mining Bitcoin Mining ~9,100 BTC Self-mined holdings The Impact of BTC Institutional Adoption When a health tech firm like H100 Group decides to allocate significant capital to Bitcoin, it sends a powerful message about the increasing normalization of cryptocurrencies. This development is a strong indicator of burgeoning BTC institutional adoption beyond the typical tech and finance sectors. It suggests that Bitcoin is maturing as an asset class, moving from the fringes of speculative investment to a legitimate component of corporate treasury management. This broader acceptance could pave the way for more diverse industries to explore similar strategies, further solidifying Bitcoin’s position in the global financial ecosystem. However, this path is not without its challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price fluctuations remain a primary concern for traditional companies. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies poses compliance challenges. Security Risks: Managing and securing large amounts of digital assets requires specialized expertise and robust infrastructure. Public Perception: Some traditional stakeholders may view crypto investments as risky or unconventional. What This Means for Crypto Funding and Beyond The successful capital raise by H100 Group, specifically for Bitcoin acquisition, also highlights an interesting shift in crypto funding mechanisms. While many crypto projects raise capital through token sales or venture rounds, H100 Group utilized traditional equity and debt markets to fund its Bitcoin strategy. This blending of conventional finance with digital asset objectives could become a more common pathway for companies looking to enter the crypto space without directly issuing their own tokens. It provides a more familiar and regulated avenue for capital acquisition, potentially opening doors for a wider range of institutional investors. Actionable Insights for Businesses and Investors: For Businesses: Evaluate your treasury strategy. Could a small allocation to digital assets like Bitcoin offer diversification or inflation protection? Consider the long-term benefits versus short-term volatility. For Investors: Pay attention to the types of companies entering the Bitcoin space. Diversified institutional adoption can signal broader market maturity and potential long-term value. In conclusion, H100 Group’s strategic $54 million investment in Bitcoin is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a powerful statement. It signifies a new chapter where companies from diverse sectors are confidently integrating digital assets into their core financial strategies. This bold move by a health tech firm underscores the increasing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin, potentially ushering in an era where Bitcoin accumulation becomes a standard component of corporate treasury management. As more companies follow suit, the lines between traditional finance and the crypto economy will continue to blur, paving the way for unprecedented innovation and growth.

2025-07-09T12:23:35,"More than half of Russia’s 'qualified investors' now have crypto stakes","Over half of investors that Russia considers qualified enough to assign money into crypto assets have already purchased cryptocurrencies, a new survey shows. Most of those who haven’t tried it yet would like to do so in the future, according to the poll that also found that they prefer to convert Russian rubles into digital coins. 90% of qualified Russian investors attracted to crypto A sizable majority of Russian investors allowed to legally trade crypto have either acquired cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or plan to do that. That’s according to a recent study carried out amid a growing crypto turnover in Russia. The results published by the business daily Vedomosti this week show that 52% of qualified investors in the country already have experience with cryptocurrency instruments, the crypto news outlet Bits.media reported. Another 38% of the respondents haven’t tried crypto yet, but they are willing to do so. That means that a total of 90% of those in the studied sample signal interest in decentralized digital assets in terms of investment opportunities. The survey was conducted among 1,500 men and women over the age of 20 in Russian cities with a population exceeding 100,000 people. All participants are qualified investors with financial assets of at least 50,000 rubles (approx. $600) in their possession. Russia is yet to comprehensively regulate operations with cryptocurrencies, but its main financial regulators, the Bank of Russia and the Ministry of Finance, have made it clear they do not intend to admit every Russian to the crypto market. In March, the central bank proposed to permit a limited number of investors to buy and sell digital coins under a special “experimental legal regime.” The monetary authority insisted these should only be “ highly qualified investors .” To be granted this status, private individuals would need to prove annual income of at least 50 million rubles (over $600,000) and investments in securities or deposits exceeding 100 million rubles (more than $1.2 million), although these thresholds are still to be officially approved. While the Central Bank of Russia itself is not planning to add Bitcoin to its reserves, it announced in May that qualified investors are free to buy crypto derivatives, including securities with yields tied to cryptocurrency prices, as long as these are non-deliverable. A number of Russian financial institutions have since joined the race to offer clients such products . Among them is Russia’s largest stock market, the Moscow Exchange, which recently unveiled that it will launch a crypto futures contract based on its own new Bitcoin index . Russians keep buying Bitcoin, defying restrictive rules Despite the opposition of financial authorities in Moscow against allowing ordinary Russians to purchase cryptocurrencies, a recent estimate indicated that Russian citizens have already acquired well over $25 billion worth of crypto assets. Around 60% of the respondents in the new study quoted by the Russian press expect interest in cryptocurrency-based products to increase as a result of the growing offering of such instruments from established companies. They highlight the reliability of service providers as a key factor for their decisions (43%), along with low fees (24%) and convenient deposits and withdrawals (24%), noted analysts at the Russian investment firm BCS, who compiled the report. The survey also found that the main motives for getting hold of crypto instruments include long-term investments (57% of respondents), portfolio diversification (32%), and short-term speculation (25%). The authors detail further: “Currently, 33% of investors have 5-10% of their portfolios invested in instruments related to crypto assets.” A clear majority among the polled Russian investors, 78%, prefer the services of domestic platforms registered in Russia’s jurisdiction. Most investors, 85%, also like using Russian rubles to top up their investment accounts. Insufficient knowledge about digital assets and the high volatility of cryptocurrencies have been singled out as the main barriers to investing in crypto-linked financial instruments.

2025-07-09T12:21:19,"OSR Holdings Announces Strategic Roadmap for Tokenization Under Reg D Framework in Partnership with BCM Europe AG","BELLEVUE, Wash. and ZUG, Switzerland , July 9, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — OSR Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: OSRH), a global healthcare company advancing biomedical and wellness innovation, today announced the official roadmap for a targeted $50 million security token offering (STO) planned for launch in the second half of 2025 under Regulation D of the U.S. Securities Act. The token, with the working title OSRT, will be a securitized digital asset representing OSR Holdings’ equity exposure and is designed to align with the company’s blockchain-based capital strategy. As part of this roadmap, Taekwondo Access Credit (TAC)—a utility token that rewards participation and has growing adoption in the global Taekwondo community —will be accepted alongside Bitcoin (BTC) and Tether (USDT) as eligible currencies for subscription to the OSRT offering. Taekwondo remains one of the world’s most widely practiced martial arts, with an estimated 70 million practitioners of all ages across 190 countries. TAC has been selected as one of the subscription tokens for the upcoming STO, alongside BTC and USDT, for its possible real-world utility with blood glucose monitoring devices, details of which OSRH intends to announce in a forthcoming press release. BCM Europe intends to convert a substantial portion of its TAC holdings into BTC or USDT through market-based transactions prior to its anticipated participation. Due to the convertibility of TAC into OSRT and to ensure compliance and mitigate potential insider trading concerns, BCM Europe AG, the issuer of TAC and the largest shareholder of OSRH, w ill not be permitted to use TAC directly in subscribing to the OSRT offering.

Major conglomerate SBI Group's APLUS is letting cardholders redeem APLUS points for small amounts of bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), or XRP (XRP). 2,100 points will earn users over 2,000 japanese yen worth of tokens, around $13 at current exchange rates. The crypto is handled by SBI’s exchange arm and deposited directly into the user’s VC Trade account. The feature is opt-in and available only for cards that qualify under the APLUS Points program. Although a relatively small amount, it marks the first time cryptocurrency has been added to APLUS’s prize catalog, which previously focused on cashbacks and partner rewards. For SBI, it’s a low-stakes way to drive user exposure without pushing speculative trading. The bank has backed Ripple for years, and XRP was the first token listed on VC Trade when it launched in 2018. The integration matters in Japan’s heavily regulated crypto environment, signaling a level of compliance maturity that most regions still lack and offering everyday card users a glimpse of the crypto experience without the marketing blitz.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/09/japans-sbi-to-let-users-swap-credit-card-points-for-bitcoin-ether-and-xrp,"ASIA|XRP|BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Market|Trading|Japan|credit cards|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-09T12:14:00,"$31B Binance Stablecoin Surge Signals Altcoin Rally Ahead – Best Altcoins to Buy Now","Binance has received a major injection of liquidity. The world’s largest crypto exchange has witnessed an eye-popping $31B influx in stablecoins, primarily in $USDT and $USDC. When a substantial amount of capital is sitting idle in stablecoins, it often indicates that investors are preparing to shift funds into more speculative assets, like altcoins. The reason is that stablecoins are a crucial source of on-chain funds. Because of their 1:1 ratio to fiat currencies like the US dollar, they carry less risk and allow traders to enter the market quickly when the time is right. With signs pointing to an altcoin season likely in store, now could be the best time to invest in the best altcoins – like Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) , and Treasure ($MAGIC) – before major price action possibly begins. Stablecoins Pile Up While $BTC Withdrawals Surge At the same time, indicators and cryptocurrency analysts are closely monitoring $BTC activity. While significant amounts of dollars are being invested in stablecoins, $BTC is being withdrawn from crypto exchanges . The combination of rising stablecoin reserves and falling $BTC exchange balances suggests that capital is sitting on the sidelines. Investors appear to be waiting to jump into altcoins when a breakout begins. From 2023 to 2024, Binance’s stablecoin and Bitcoin reserves were closely correlated, while the growing stablecoin reserves provided liquidity for bitcoin purchases. —Tim Oinen, Cryptoquant This correlation started weakening in late 2024. But in early 2025, that pattern changed. $USDT and $USDC reserves surged to a record $31B on Binance, while $BTC reserves dropped. Oinonen calls this ‘decoupling,’ suggesting that investors are moving $BTC to long-term storage (cold wallets), while holding stablecoins as ‘dry powder’ ready to deploy – possibly into altcoins. With the total stablecoin market cap now over $255B, liquidity is building across the board. If the market picks up, altcoins could rally fast. This makes now a favorable time to snag $BEST , $SUBBD , and $MAGIC before they likely rise in price. 1. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Official Token to No-KYC, Multi-Chain Crypto Wallet With MPC Security $BEST is the native token of the Best Wallet app, our #1 anonymous crypto wallet designed to simplify and secure access to the decentralized world. As a non-custodial, multi-chain wallet, it supports over 1K+ digital assets, soon across over 60 blockchain networks – all without requiring KYC when creating the account. It makes it easy to buy, store, send, and trade crypto assets – including top altcoins – while offering top-notch features like cross-chain swaps and portfolio management. It even has a built-in launchpad for the best crypto presales . All is achieved without compromising security. Best Wallet leverages Fireblocks’ MPC technology to eliminate single points of failure by storing private keys in a secure, single location. Moreover, instead of using traditional seed phrases, you’ll get secure cloud backups and biometric login for safer, easier access. Seed phrase exploits and front-end compromises were responsible for over 80% of crypto losses in the first half of 2025. So, choosing a wallet like Best Wallet is useful to safeguard against such threats. To make the most of Best Wallet, you’ll want to purchase $BEST . Then, you can enjoy lower gas fees, higher staking rewards (currently at a 100% APY), and governance rights to vote on the mobile app’s future trajectory. $BEST is currently available for just $0.025305. But act fast. Following exchange listings and new developments (like Best Card, its upcoming crypto debit card), the altcoin’s predicted to reach $0.072 this year – a hefty 184% rise compared to its current price tag. 2. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – Boosts Creator Fandom Through AI & Blockchain Tech SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) powers an AI-driven content platform built on the blockchain for creators and fans alike. Its ultimate goal is to reshape the $85B subscription-based content industry by giving creators more control and fans novel ways to engage. For creators, it offers a comprehensive suite of AI tools, including a video generator, voice cloning, and automated profile creation. This way, they can streamline their production, reduce costs, and increase their earnings. On the other hand, fans benefit through exclusive content access, personalized AI experiences, and direct engagement with their favorite creators. Their loyalty will also be rewarded with platform perks, staking incentives, and governance votes. Together, these two-way systems can significantly boost fandom by creating a truly community-owned creator economy. Read our guide to learn more. Whether a creator or fan, you can get involved by buying $SUBBD on presale for just $0.055875. Now’s a great time to get involved, before the possible altcoin season and marketing of high-earning creators possibly push $SUBBD to $0.301 by this year’s end – a potential gain of over 438%. Considering that the SUBBD ecosystem has already attracted over 2K+ top-earning creators, the SUBBD ecosystem is already gaining serious traction. 3. Treasure ($MAGIC) – Surges 82% as Its AI Agent AbstractLaunch Nears Over the past 24 hours alone, $MAGIC has soared by more than 82% . Such a spike is driven mainly by growing excitement in Treasure, the AI-powered entertainment ecosystem that it fuels. In just five days, Treasure will launch on AbstractChain and showcase its AI agent, Smol, which is capable of autonomously learning and interacting with dApps. Also driving excitement around $MAGIC are Treasure’s three core products: Virtual companions : Personalized AI agents that play Web3 games, use social media, and trade on-chain. Smolworld : AI-infused tamagotchi-style game that brings NFT avatars to life; Bridgeworld Canopy : Strategy game showcasing swarm-AI dynamics. $MAGIC unlocks agent functionality, fuels transactions within the games, and is also the currency for Treasure Market (its NFT marketplace). Beyond utility, the token also provides an opportunity to contribute to the ecosystem’s evolution by participating in its DAO . You can get in on the action by purchasing $MAGIC on major exchanges – MEXC , OKX , Bybit – for roughly $0.21 apiece. Market Liquidity Builds, Altcoins Get Ready to Rally With billions of dollars flowing into Binance and $BTC quietly moving off exchanges, the stage is set for a massive altcoin rally. This dry powder of liquidity is likely waiting for the right catalysts, and altcoins like $BEST , $SUBBD , and $MAGIC might be the frontrunners. Whether you’re interested in non-custodial crypto wallets, decentralized content creation, or blockchain entertainment, they could be the next crypto to explode when the moment’s right.

2025-07-09T12:10:27,"Hugging Face Robots: Unleashing the Future with Reachy Mini Desktop Devices","The world of artificial intelligence and robotics is constantly evolving, presenting exciting new opportunities for innovation. For those deeply entrenched in the cryptocurrency space, understanding these technological advancements is crucial, as they often intersect with decentralized systems and the future of digital economies. A significant step forward comes from Hugging Face, a leading AI development platform , which has officially opened orders for its much-anticipated Reachy Mini desktop robots . This move isn’t just about new hardware; it’s about empowering a new generation of builders and fostering an open-source future for robotics, a philosophy that resonates strongly with the decentralized ethos of crypto. Hugging Face Robots: A New Era for AI Development Hugging Face, widely recognized for its contributions to the artificial intelligence landscape, is now extending its influence into tangible hardware. The announcement marks a pivotal moment for developers eager to bridge the gap between AI models and physical interaction. Initially unveiled as prototypes in May alongside the larger humanoid robot, HopeJR, the Reachy Mini Hugging Face robots are now ready to be shipped, allowing enthusiasts and professionals alike to begin hands-on experimentation. These compact yet powerful devices are designed to be accessible and highly programmable, reflecting Hugging Face’s commitment to democratizing AI. The company is offering two distinct versions to cater to different developer needs: Reachy Mini Wireless: Priced at $449, this version offers complete freedom of movement, running on a Raspberry Pi 5 mini-computer. Its wireless capability makes it ideal for dynamic testing environments or simply moving around a workspace. Reachy Mini Lite: A more budget-friendly option at $299, this version requires a wired connection to a computing source. It’s perfect for developers who prefer a stationary setup or have existing computing resources readily available. Both models are delivered as a kit, inviting developers to engage directly with the assembly process. This hands-on approach ensures a deeper understanding of the robot’s mechanics and encourages customization from the ground up. Meet the Reachy Mini: Your New Desktop Robotics Companion The Reachy Mini is more than just a piece of hardware; it’s an interactive canvas for AI innovation. Roughly the size of a standard stuffed animal, these delightful desktop robots feature two screens for expressive eyes and two antennas, giving them a friendly and approachable demeanor. Once assembled, the true power of the Reachy Mini comes to life: full programmability in Python. This Python integration is a game-changer, as it’s one of the most popular languages for AI and robotics development, making the Reachy Mini accessible to a vast community of coders. Furthermore, each device comes with a set of pre-installed demos, allowing users to quickly get started and explore its capabilities. A core advantage is its seamless integration with the Hugging Face Hub, the company’s vast open-source machine learning platform. This integration grants users immediate access to an incredible repository of over 1.7 million AI models and more than 400,000 datasets, providing an unparalleled resource for building sophisticated applications. The Power of Open-Source Robotics: Why It Matters Hugging Face CEO, Clém Delangue, shared insights with Bitcoin World, revealing that the decision to launch two versions of the Reachy Mini was directly influenced by initial user feedback on their original prototype. Delangue recounted a poignant anecdote about an early tester whose five-year-old daughter wanted to carry the desktop robot around the house. This feedback highlighted a clear demand for portability and user-centric design. “The goal in the future is to keep carefully getting a lot of feedback like that from users, from the community, that’s how we’ve always been building products at Hugging Face as an open source community platform,” Delangue stated. This philosophy underpins the entire project. The inherent nature of the open-source robotics design means that “people will be able to extend it, modify it, change everything they want.” This collaborative approach fosters rapid innovation and ensures the technology evolves in line with community needs and desires, much like the collaborative development seen in many blockchain projects. Empowering AI Developers: Building the Future Together Delangue emphasized that the primary target audience for these devices is dedicated AI developers . The Reachy Minis provide a unique sandbox for coding, building, and rigorously testing AI applications in a physical environment. This hands-on experience is invaluable for understanding the nuances of real-world robotics. “Anyone will be able to build their own specific features and apps for Reachy Mini that then they’ll be able to share with the community,” Delangue explained. This vision extends beyond individual projects; it aims to cultivate a vibrant ecosystem where creativity flourishes. “So we hope that it’s really going to unleash the creativity of builders to build, you know, millions of different applications, millions of different features that they can share with the community, so that anyone can then, like, plug and play with it.” This emphasis on community-driven development and shareable applications mirrors the collaborative spirit often found in open-source blockchain initiatives, where shared codebases drive collective progress. Availability and the Vision Ahead Developers won’t have to wait long to get their hands on these innovative robots. The Reachy Mini Lite is slated to begin shipping next month, with the wireless version following later this year. Delangue highlighted the importance of a swift shipping process, opting against lengthy pre-order timelines to ensure the robots reach users as quickly as possible. This commitment to rapid deployment reflects a desire to accelerate development and feedback cycles within the community. This release aligns perfectly with Hugging Face’s broader vision for its robotics program: to champion open-source hardware that grants users complete control. “I feel like it’s really important for the future of robotics to be open source, instead of being closed source, black box, [and] concentrated in the hands of a few companies,” Delangue asserted. He articulated a compelling argument for decentralized control in robotics, drawing parallels to concerns about centralized power in other technological domains. “I think it’s quite a scary world to have like millions of robots in people’s home controlled by one company, with customers, users, not really being able to control them, understand them. I would much rather live in a place, or in a world, or in a country, where everyone can have some control over the robots.” This strong advocacy for user autonomy and transparency resonates deeply with the core principles of decentralization championed by the cryptocurrency community. A Glimpse into an Open Future The launch of the Hugging Face Reachy Mini desktop robots is more than just a product release; it’s a statement about the future of AI and robotics. By embracing an open-source, community-driven approach, Hugging Face is not only making advanced robotics more accessible but also fostering an environment where innovation can truly thrive. For AI developers , this means unprecedented opportunities to experiment, build, and share, contributing to a collective intelligence that will shape the next generation of intelligent machines. The emphasis on user control and transparency echoes the very foundations of decentralized technologies, suggesting a harmonious path forward where powerful AI tools are democratized, not monopolized.

2025-07-09T12:00:25,"Bitcoin Acquisition: LQwD Unleashes $9M Private Placement for Explosive Crypto Growth","In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, strategic moves by innovative companies often signal significant shifts. One such development comes from LQWD Technologies Corp., a Canadian firm at the forefront of Bitcoin Lightning infrastructure. They’ve just announced a substantial upsizing of their private placement, securing a remarkable C$12.3 million (approximately $9 million USD). This isn’t just about raising capital; it’s a bold statement, primarily earmarked for a strategic Bitcoin acquisition and strengthening their position in the digital asset space. This move highlights a growing trend of companies embracing digital assets not just for operational purposes, but as a core treasury strategy. What does this mean for the future of Bitcoin, the Lightning Network, and the broader crypto market? What is This Landmark LQwD Technologies Investment? LQWD Technologies Corp., known for its pioneering work in developing and operating infrastructure for the Bitcoin Lightning Network, has successfully expanded its previously announced funding initiative. Initially, the company aimed for a smaller raise, but strong investor interest allowed them to significantly increase the offering. According to a press release distributed via GlobeNewswire, the total amount secured through both brokered and non-brokered private placements now stands at an impressive C$12.3 million, translating to roughly $9 million USD. This substantial capital injection serves a dual purpose. The primary allocation of the net proceeds is designated for the acquisition of Bitcoin. This decision reflects a strategic financial approach, leveraging Bitcoin as a core treasury asset, which many forward-thinking companies are now considering. Beyond Bitcoin holdings, a portion of the funds will also be directed towards general corporate purposes, ensuring LQwD has the necessary liquidity to continue its operational growth, research, and development efforts in the burgeoning crypto sector. This significant financial boost positions LQwD Technologies to further solidify its leadership in the Bitcoin Lightning space, providing crucial infrastructure that enhances Bitcoin’s scalability and utility. Why a Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition Now? The decision by LQwD Technologies to allocate a significant portion of its newly raised capital towards a direct Bitcoin acquisition is a compelling one, reflecting a broader trend of corporate adoption of digital assets. Why now, and what are the underlying strategic reasons for this move? Treasury Management: For many companies, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a robust alternative to traditional fiat currencies for treasury reserves. Its decentralized nature and fixed supply offer a hedge against inflation and currency debasement, making it an attractive long-term store of value. Alignment with Core Business: As a company deeply embedded in the Bitcoin ecosystem through its Lightning Network infrastructure, holding Bitcoin directly aligns with LQwD’s core mission and operational model. It demonstrates confidence in the asset they facilitate transactions for. Market Opportunity: Companies often time their Bitcoin acquisitions based on market conditions. While the crypto market can be volatile, strategic purchases during opportune moments can yield significant long-term returns, strengthening the company’s balance sheet. Enhanced Credibility: By holding Bitcoin, LQwD reinforces its commitment and belief in the future of Bitcoin and its underlying technology. This can enhance investor confidence and market perception, signaling a deep conviction in the digital economy. This strategic move goes beyond simply accumulating an asset; it’s about integrating Bitcoin into the very fabric of the company’s financial strategy, underscoring its belief in the asset’s enduring value and its role in the future of finance. How Does This Fuel the Lightning Network’s Potential? LQwD Technologies’ core business revolves around the Lightning Network , a second-layer payment protocol built on top of Bitcoin. This network aims to solve Bitcoin’s scalability issues by enabling faster, cheaper, and more frequent transactions. So, how does this substantial funding, particularly the Bitcoin acquisition, directly impact and fuel the Lightning Network’s potential? The Lightning Network relies on channels funded by Bitcoin. Companies like LQwD operate these nodes and channels, routing payments across the network. By acquiring more Bitcoin, LQwD can: Increase Channel Capacity: More Bitcoin means LQwD can open larger and more robust payment channels on the Lightning Network. This increases the total capacity of the network, allowing for larger individual transactions and more efficient routing. Enhance Network Liquidity: With greater Bitcoin holdings, LQwD can provide better liquidity across its nodes, ensuring that payments can be routed quickly and reliably without delays due to insufficient channel balances. This improves the overall user experience and reliability of Lightning payments. Strengthen Network Stability: A well-capitalized node operator with significant Bitcoin reserves contributes to the stability and decentralization of the Lightning Network. It reduces reliance on a few large entities and makes the network more resilient. Support Future Development: While a portion of funds is for Bitcoin, the general corporate purposes allocation directly supports the technical development and expansion of LQwD’s Lightning Network infrastructure. This includes improving node software, enhancing security, and exploring new features. Ultimately, this investment isn’t just about holding Bitcoin; it’s about empowering the infrastructure that makes Bitcoin more usable for everyday transactions, paving the way for a more scalable and efficient digital economy powered by the Lightning Network . Understanding the Private Placement Mechanism: What Does It Entail? The funding secured by LQwD Technologies comes in the form of an upsized private placement . But what exactly does a private placement mean, and how does it differ from other fundraising methods? A private placement is a direct offering of securities (like shares or convertible notes) to a select group of investors, rather than through a public offering on a stock exchange. This method is often chosen for several reasons: Speed and Efficiency: Private placements can be executed much faster than public offerings, as they involve fewer regulatory hurdles and less extensive documentation. Targeted Investors: Companies can handpick investors who understand their business model, vision, and long-term potential, often institutional investors, high-net-worth individuals, or strategic partners. Cost-Effectiveness: While fees are still involved, the overall costs associated with a private placement can be lower than a full-blown initial public offering (IPO) or secondary public offering. LQwD’s placement included both brokered and non-brokered components. A brokered private placement involves an investment bank or broker-dealer acting as an intermediary to find investors, while a non-brokered placement is conducted directly by the company without an intermediary. The upsizing from an initially planned smaller amount to C$12.3 million indicates strong investor confidence in LQwD’s strategy and the future of Bitcoin Lightning infrastructure. Here’s a simplified comparison of the private placement’s scale: Aspect Original Placement Size (Approx.) Upsized Private Placement (Approx.) Total Capital Raised C$7.5 million ($5.5 million USD) C$12.3 million ($9 million USD) Primary Use of Funds Bitcoin Acquisition, General Corporate Purposes Bitcoin Acquisition, General Corporate Purposes Investor Confidence Indication Moderate Strong This successful private placement underscores the market’s growing appetite for exposure to Bitcoin and the infrastructure supporting its evolution. Broader Implications for Crypto Investment and Corporate Strategy LQwD Technologies’ strategic move to acquire a significant amount of Bitcoin through an upsized private placement carries broader implications for the entire landscape of crypto investment and corporate strategy. This isn’t an isolated incident; it’s part of a burgeoning trend that reflects increasing institutional confidence in digital assets. What does this mean for the wider market? Validation of Bitcoin as a Treasury Asset: More companies are following the lead of pioneers like MicroStrategy, treating Bitcoin as a legitimate treasury reserve asset. This trend could accelerate as regulatory clarity improves and more traditional financial institutions offer crypto-related services. Growth in Bitcoin Infrastructure: Investments like LQwD’s directly support the underlying infrastructure that makes Bitcoin more usable. As the Lightning Network expands and becomes more robust, it enhances Bitcoin’s utility as a medium of exchange, not just a store of value. This makes Bitcoin a more attractive investment for both individuals and institutions. Increased Institutional Participation: The success of LQwD’s private placement indicates that institutional investors are actively seeking opportunities to gain exposure to the crypto space, particularly through companies building essential infrastructure. This influx of sophisticated capital can bring stability and maturity to the market. Precedent for Other Fintechs: LQwD’s approach could serve as a blueprint for other fintech firms looking to integrate digital assets more deeply into their business models and financial strategies. It showcases a viable path for leveraging private capital to pursue crypto-centric growth. Actionable Insights for Investors: For those observing the crypto market, LQwD’s move offers several insights: Look Beyond Spot Prices: While Bitcoin’s price movements are captivating, understanding the underlying infrastructure development (like the Lightning Network) and corporate adoption strategies provides a more holistic view of the market’s long-term health. Identify Enabling Technologies: Companies that build essential services and infrastructure for the crypto economy, like LQwD, can offer compelling investment opportunities as the sector matures. Monitor Corporate Treasury Trends: Keep an eye on public and private companies announcing Bitcoin acquisitions or crypto-related treasury strategies. These announcements can signal growing mainstream acceptance and potentially influence market dynamics. While the benefits are clear, it’s also important to acknowledge potential challenges. The crypto market remains volatile, and regulatory landscapes are still evolving. Companies undertaking such strategies must navigate these risks carefully. However, LQwD’s successful crypto investment and funding round signal a strong conviction in the long-term potential of Bitcoin and its supporting technologies. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards a Bitcoin-Powered Future LQwD Technologies’ successful upsizing of its private placement to $9 million, primarily for a strategic Bitcoin acquisition, marks a pivotal moment for the company and a significant indicator for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. This move not only fortifies LQwD’s balance sheet with a robust digital asset but also underscores its unwavering commitment to building and scaling the vital Bitcoin Lightning Network infrastructure. It reflects a growing trend of corporate confidence in Bitcoin as a fundamental asset and a strategic component of future-proof business models. By investing directly in Bitcoin and simultaneously enhancing its operational capacity, LQwD is positioning itself at the vanguard of the digital economy. This development signals that the integration of digital assets into mainstream corporate finance is not just a passing fad but a strategic imperative for innovation and growth. As companies like LQwD continue to push the boundaries, the vision of a more efficient, decentralized, and Bitcoin-powered financial future moves ever closer to reality.

The number of possible new coins is capped. We won’t reach the end till about 2140, but growth will decelerate as we progress toward then. So, it makes sense for RIOT to diversify. Like other miners, it’s eyeing the data center business, a power-hungry cousin to mining. Success here won’t be automatic for anybody. But…. I think RIOT will succeed. It has a lot of good land near Dallas, an important Tier 1 data center region. This contributes to my story-oriented “Buy” rating. Remember when… Remember when Amazon.com, Inc. ( AMZN ) sold books online? The company still does that, but it’s better known for other things today (selling countless different things, cloud). Remember when Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT ) was about operating systems? The company still does that, but it’s better known for other things today (cloud, application software). Remember when MicroStrategy sold enterprise analytics software? The company still does that, but with a new name, MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ), it’s now better known for other things (bitcoin Treasury holdings). Remember when Riot Blockchain was about Bitcoin mining? It still is and has lately been getting better at it, but the company rebranded in 2023 as Riot Platforms, Inc. (RIOT). That reflects its wish to diversify. RIOT can be uncomfortable for investors. It involves two words many find scary… I suggested one of them above… diversification. This sounds respectable, even essential, on its face. Investors constantly hear this when it comes to asset allocation. It can also serve companies well… so long as it’s done wisely. But many companies do it badly. As investment legend Peter Lynch says, one should guard against “ diworsification .” Rather than generating shareholder wealth, they instead make things worse… and generate accounting write-offs. Diversification might sound less challenging if we could at least understand and relax about RIOT’s core competency. But its established business confronts us with the other scary word. One, of course, is bitcoin. Many swear by it as the wave of the future in finance, as a store of value and as a better alternative to conventional money. Many others scorn it as nonsense or gambling. An investment case for or against RIOT stock should be based on how one evaluates it in terms of the two challenging words, diversification and bitcoin. Let’s start looking more closely at the latter… My Stance Toward Bitcoin Has Evolved and is Now Much More Positive Than It Was a Year or So Ago It took me a long time before I came around on bitcoin, and crypto in general. Like many, I thought it was nonsense at worst and at best, gambling without cool casinos, fun shows, and countless restaurants. Too, it can be easy (and self-gratifying) to see market participants as an ignorant or dysfunctional herd. Folks like Ben Graham and Warren Buffet helped to legitimize that view with the Mr. Market allegory . But as I accumulate years of experience analyzing investments (since late 1979), I’ve learned more and more about how important it is to respect the market. Information has become increasingly plentiful. And different views are more likely to reflect different investment goals and risk preferences. True stupidity is quite rare. That helped me see Bitcoin less as folly and more like a collectible… a digital collectible. How much different, once we adapt to the now-ubiquitous digital world, is a bitcoin than a gold bar or a baseball card picturing a great 1950s-era player. (See generally here ). Of course, some things are more collectible than other things. The bursting of the 1600s Dutch tulipmania proved that. As it turned out, the more I learned about the potentially functional properties of crypto and blockchain , the less necessary it became to delve deeper into the philosophy of collectibles. RIOT holds some bitcoin in Treasury (19,223 coins, amounting to about $5 per diluted RIOT share at bitcoin’s recent price of about $108,000). But unlike MSTR, it doesn’t necessarily hold permanently. RIOT has recently shown itself to be willing to use its bitcoin to help it raise capital for other things. (See below). And operationally… RIOT is One of the Major Domestic Bitcoin Miners Bitcoin mining is something of a brain scrambler. That’s so even for those who’ve learned to accept crypto as a legitimate asset. It’s a complex process. But it’s also quite interesting. (I explain more, in regular people language, in my 5/27/25 MARA report ). Here are the key aspects of mining you need to know to assess the investment merits of RIOT: Miners get newly issued coins by successfully answering an absurdly complex mathematical puzzle. Success requires a monstrous amount of computing trial and error. This is very electricity intensive. So, mining profitability isn’t only about bitcoin prices. It’s also about controlling power costs and mining equipment energy efficiency. Each trial is called a hash. Mining power is expressed as “hashrate” (number of trial answers per second). More trials and higher hashrates increase the likelihood of success. The number of possible bitcoins is capped at 21 million. To postpone the end date as far as possible, the number of coins awarded per successful hash is periodically cut in half. As miners go, RIOT is quite good. Scale alone helps RIOT manage power costs. But its primary Texas location may be a much bigger plus. The deregulated power market there opens up opportunities for creativity. A big thing for RIOT is its power curtailment strategy . Based on this, RIOT shuts mining operations during local periods of peak electricity demand. It especially times this in relation to the June through September Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) Four Coincident Peak (4CP) periods. But it doesn’t just stop trying to get Bitcoin. RIOT also sells power back to the grid during high-demand intervals. With electricity prices spiking at such times, RIOT does well, perhaps even better than it could by mining, on these occasions. According to CFO Colin Yee on the 5/1/25 earnings call : Direct cost of mine, excluding depreciation, in the first quarter of 2025 was $43,808 per Bitcoin, of which power costs amounted to $35,313 per Bitcoin or 81% of total direct cost per Bitcoin. Quarter-over-quarter, our net power costs decreased from $0.038 a kilowatt hour to $0.034 a kilowatt hour as Riot's power strategy continued to yield strong results. Another plus is RIOT’s dual cooling approach . It optimizes as appropriate between immersion and air-cooled systems. That’s another way to control power costs. Also, RIOT has a small Energy/Infrastructure operation. It contributes little in the way of revenues and profits. But it helps make RIOT vertically integrated . That means it gives the company more than usual control over its mining hardware supply chain. The unit makes equipment specifically geared for RIOT’s needs. Meanwhile, RIOT has dramatically increased its hashrate over the past year. RIOT IR The company has, lately, spent heavily to buy cutting-edge mining equipment. An acquisition of sorts (a deal involving Corsicana – see below) added to RIOT’s already-large scale. So bitcoin mining, the company’s dominant current business, is on a roll. Analyst Compilation and Calculations based on data from pages F47 - F48 of latest 10-K and pages 31-32 of latest 10-Q Analyst Compilation and Calculations based on data from pages F47 - F48 of latest 10-K and pages 31-32 of latest 10-Q Analyst Compilation and Calculations based on data from pages F47 - F48 of latest 10-K and pages 31-32 of latest 10-Q But let’s remember… As Great as Things Now Look for RIOT Mining, This Business Has a Ceiling RIOT’s forward hashrate expectations do not look especially buoyant. RIOT IR It could probably work harder to mine better… if it wished to. And as the slide notes, a recent acquisition (Rhodium) allows for some guidance upside (more below). Ultimately, though, the company strategically decided to refrain from adding much to mining capital spending. In fact, its latest 38.4 EH/s hashrate forecast is the result of management’s downward revision. It previously forecast 46.7 EH/s . (NOTE: EH/s means exahashes per second, or one quintillion hashes per second. A quintillion is one followed by 18 zeroes!) This relates to the last of the prior section’s bullet points. It bears repeating. The number of possible bitcoins is capped at 21 million. To postpone the end date as far as possible, the number of coins awarded per successful hash is periodically cut in half. Don’t panic… Mining isn’t likely to max out until about 2140 . But halving events (periodic reductions in the number of coins awarded for successful hashes) will continue to make this a progressively harder and probably less lucrative business. That seems opposed to what growth investors want. (Value investors don’t even get there… They’re likely stuck on the word “bitcoin.”) Rest assured RIOT management does NOT have its head in the sand about this. As noted above, it’s diversifying. To support this, RIOT is shifting resources and attention away from trying to max out on mining. That said… Diversification is not inevitable. The company could simply live with the halvings. Investors in natural resource royalty trusts and target date ETFs or mutual funds do something like that. (They face liquidation targets). So, too, could Bitcoin mining shareholders adjust (assuming they appropriately study up and really learn what’s going on). Combined with the RIOT’s owning bitcoin and serving as an asset play, this could work. So, RIOT can’t just diversify and insist all will be well. It also needs to diversify sensibly and well . Diversification must be better than alternative solutions. Diworsification won’t do! That’s why I referred above to diversification as one of the scary RIOT words. But there’s good news… RIOT’s Planned Move into Data Centers Stands an Excellent Chance of Success Demand for Data Centers in General Anybody with any interest in AI, HPC (High Performance Computing), etc. had to wonder about this earlier this year. Who among us could forget DeepSeek Apocalypse ( so named by me ). That happened when Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Co., Ltd. ( DEEPSEEK ) announced it created a great AI model that cost much less than popular models then in use. AI-related stocks tanked. So, too, did those that relate to data centers. Investors assumed we were overspending. Many observers and investors feared cutbacks and lower data center demand. But eventually, analytic heads with boots-on-the-ground vantage points prevailed. And once-beaten-down stocks rebounded. On the 6/12/25 Oracle Corporation ( ORCL ) earnings call , Larry Ellison, that company’s Co-Founder, Chairman and CTO, was quite definitive: Let me add, we recently got an order that said we'll take all the capacity you have wherever it is. It could be in Europe, it could be in Asia. We'll just take everything. I mean we never got an order like that before. We had to move things around. We did the best we could to give them the capacity they needed. The demand is astronomical… [D]emand right now seems almost insatiable. I mean I don't know how to describe it. I've never seen anything remotely like this. I mean people are calling up and asking us, please, can you find us more capacity. We'll take it wherever. It's in Malaysia, we'll take it fine. We'll take it there. We got some wherever. EMCOR Group, Inc. ( EME ) management shared similar views. See my 6/20/25 EME report for more. RIOT agrees with this assessment. RIOT IR CEO Jason Les verbalized it thusly on the 5/1/25 earnings call : [W]e continue to be very encouraged by the feedback that we've received not just from hyperscalers but potential financing partners, which will be critical in this development as well. And everyone continues to recognize the value of power that can be delivered in the near term. In this case, we're talking about 2026. The fact remains. There's approximately 5 gigawatts of data center capacity being used for generative AI today, and the forecast is we're going to need about 30 gigawatts by 2030. So that's a pretty big delta to fill in a pretty short period of time. And as a result, we continue to see strong demand. Bottom line: Demand for data centers isn’t shrinking. It’s soaring. Nobody should quibble with this as a chosen field for RIOT’s diversification efforts. Of course, that alone won’t support an investment case for RIOT. We need to go further. We can’t naively assume every data center venture will succeed. Introducing the Data Center Business… plus Location Location and Location In general, if you hear of a Bitcoin miner aspiring to data center work, start with a presumption of innocence. Bitcoin mining has a voracious appetite for power. Ditto modern AI- and HPC-oriented data centers. So, they’re compatible bedfellows. Focusing on AI, today’s main headline grabber, data needs vary. If you’re thinking about model training, think big… or rather HUGE! This is where we expose models to monstrous amounts of information. Using that data, the models learn how to recognize patterns, spit back old information, and answer new questions. Think of training as a university where AI models studied. (And as in human universities, there’s continuing education. New information/data is always being generated. So models need to keep updating their training. In human terms, we refer to this as lifelong learning ). Then, there’s inference. This is where graduates go out into the world, get jobs, and do regular work. This is about inference. It’s what you’re doing if you use ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, etc. It’s what Seeking Alpha does when it creates AI stock reports or Earnings Call Insights. Training tasks are monumental, but not necessarily frequent. Inference tasks tend to be smaller (by AI standards, which is still huge compared to non-AI tasks). But they’re frequent. Some data centers are huge. Others are smaller. Either way, we still need heretofore unimaginable amounts of power. Expect RIOT to work with larger centers. It’ll likely serve hyperscalers. (That term refers to the giants like Azure or Google Cloud). Geography plays a big role in that choice. Some parts of the country are better than others for big data centers. Electricity regulatory climates play a big role here. So, too, do access to good power sources and well-educated workforces. (See generally, here and here ). Number one is the Data Center Alley. That’s a nickname for a large northern Virginia concentration of data centers. RIOT is not there. But RIOT is right near Dallas Texas. That’s one of the Tier 1 U.S. data center markets. RIOT IR Dallas ranks number two , right behind Virginia. (See also, here ). Pivoting to Take Advantage of Its Texas-Sized Data Center Opportunity In 2022, RIOT bought a large land parcel, known as Corsicana, in Navarro County, Texas. It planned to create “ the world’s largest Bitcoin mining facility .” In May 2025, RIOT bought adjoining parcels. It thus more than doubled its Corsicana footprint. The latter … is part of Riot's plan to build large-scale data centers tailored for enterprise and hyperscale clients. CEO Jason Les emphasized that these data centers require significantly larger footprints than traditional mining operations, underscoring the company's ambition to diversify its revenue streams. To lead this initiative, Riot hired industry veteran Jonathan Gibbs as Chief Data Center Officer, signaling its commitment to expanding into the fast-growing market for AI-ready infrastructure. Here’s a visual presentation of the outcome of the land transactions. RIOT IR Les expects to serve big-league data center tenants at Corsicana: There are a number of hyperscalers and even large companies beyond hyperscalers that are in high need of power data center capacity to meet their growth targets. So I would say, especially because of the location of our site that allows it to be used for generative AI training, inference or cloud applications being 60 miles away from Dallas, a Tier 1 data center, there's a lot of different things you can do at that site. So our view is the whole hyperscaler landscape and beyond that are potential tenants in this -- for the Corsicana facility. As far as feedback, feedback from our advisers has matched really what we've gotten from tenants. And that's why we've been working on improving the land, adding water and additional fiber connectivity. These weren't things that were holding us back, but we've gotten feedback on what we can do to make the offering more compelling and put ourselves in the best position possible to be successful. As great as all this sounds, let’s maintain perspective… This is a development situation. It’s not a here-and-now money-geyser for RIOT. Even in Texas, as business-friendly as it is, it takes time to get something like this off the ground. Here are the results of the study RIOT conducted to assess what it can do with Corsicana. RIOT IR And here’s a sense of RIOT’s path forward in data centers. RIOT IR RIOT IR So as intriguing as RIOT seems, let’s now switch gears. We need to discuss topics that’ll help keep us away from the dreaded irrational exuberance… Numbers (To the Extent We Have Any Worth Examining) If you love numbers, you’ll hate RIOT. This is not a pre-revenue development entity. But neither is it an old-timer. It didn’t really get going, commerce-wise, until after the pandemic. Besides the small commercial sample, two more things make RIOT hard to quantitatively analyze. 1. Accounting for Bitcoin Operations Traditionally, companies had to write the value of bitcoin holding to account for any paper losses. OKI. Prices fall. Holdings lose value. I get it. But they were not allowed to write those values back up when Bitcoin prices recovered! Seriously! Finally, in late 2023, the accounting powers that be recognized how silly that was. So, they changed the rule to allow companies to write assets back up when appropriate. (It took effect in late 2024). Nice! Who could argue with more economic reality. But it still leaves workaday stock analysts in a quandary. Now we have two-way quarter-to-quarter profit fluctuations as bitcoin zigs and zags. Accounting standards setters pose no solutions for this volatility. I can’t think of anything either. So, it looks like we’ll just have to grit our collective teeth and cope. 2. RIOT’s Strategic Spending and Strategic Pivot Recall that Corsicana first became a gleam in RIOT’s corporate eye in 2022. It started out planning to seriously expand mining capabilities. Translation: big spending. And, of course, there’s the pivot to data centers. Translation: More spending. Numbers We Can Look At Given the above discussion, here are the only numbers I feel able to show you with a straight face. Analyst Compilation based on Data from Seeking Alpha Financial Presentations Notice the footnote below the table! You won’t be able to reconcile the operating margin I show with RIOT’s SEC documents. Nor will they match the income statement numbers Seeking Alpha presents based on what it gets from its data vendor. I did my own things there. I eliminated non-recurring items, especially the bitcoin valuation write-downs and write-ups. My solution is not perfect. I can’t eliminate bouncy numbers from ongoing Bitcoin transactions. (Even “Cash from Operations” is impacted). Let’s just say I’m doing the best I can. I think the best information you can extract from that table lies in the Cash etc. line and, in sections relating to Cash From Investing and Cash from Financing. You see the numerical equivalents to matters discussed above, mainly the expansion of mining and the pivot toward data centers. You also see that RIOT needs outside capital to keep going. That’s also so for many of today’s emerging companies. Risk Needless to say, the risk here is high. Conservative investors, look but don’t touch. Even risk-tolerant folks should size positions appropriately (i.e., small) relative to their total portfolio. Any in-development venture is necessarily risky. Will it succeed? I explained why I think RIOT will succeed. But until that actually happens, it’s a source of risk. Further… Dependence on infusions of outside capital is always risky. But the markets will likely oblige and give RIOT what it requires so long as its strategy and progress remain credible. (That’s how it is usually in situations like this. See, e.g., the financial strength discussion in my 5/21/24 CVNA writeup ). Helping, too, is RIOT’s willingness to get creative using its Bitcoin in terms of capital strategy. As Jason Chung, Head of Corporate Development and Strategy explained on the 5/1/25 earnings call (Note: ATM means at-the-market equity issuance): I think our financing activities this quarter could give a good sense of how we're thinking about all the different financing options that we have available to us. So we saw extremely limited use of the ATM, and therefore, very minimal dilution to our shareholders. When we did issue into the ATM, we achieved an average share price of $13.05 per share. So we feel pretty good about our timing when we did utilize the ATM on a limited basis. But in addition to that, we took two other steps, right? In April, we started selling our monthly Bitcoin production as well, raising additional funds that way. And now with the Coinbase facility, we've opened up another avenue of financing for us that, again, side steps the ATM. What to do About RIOT Stock Don’t even think in terms of valuation ratios. There are none here that are meaningful. Here’s the price chart. StockCharts.com There’s most recently been a lot of very positive sentiment toward RIOT. We see that in the way the 10-day exponential moving average ((EMA)) has been above and running away from the also strong 50-day EMA. We also see it in Chaikin Money Flow ((CMF)) and the Chaikin Oscillator (CO). Both measure which party to trade is more motivated. CMF does it for institutional investors. CO does it for the market in general. Both indicators have been very strong. Buyers being more motivated than sellers typically exerts upward pressure on stock prices. But trees don’t grow unabated to the sky. We have to expect a near-term breather. (We’ve seen big ups and downs before. We already see an indication of price fatigue in the very latest price bar next to the right-side edge.) All in all, nothing I see in the chart runs counter to my judgment regarding this stock. And in terms of that judgment… This is one of many emerging growth stocks today for which no meaningful valuation numbers can be calculated. It’s about the story. But it can’t be any story. It has to be a good story. And it has to be a credible story. My favorite example is value-guru William Miller’s very early investment into Amazon.com, Inc. ((AMZN)) almost on day one. I’ve described other examples on 1/12/25 with RGTI, and on 6/10/25 with QS. I see RIOT as one among that group. When it comes to rating stocks, I think in terms of probable future stock performance relative to the market, rather than literally buying, holding, or selling. And since I’m not rating based on a quant model, I’ll eschew “Strong…” extremes. Absent an exceptional degree of conviction, I think “Buy,” Hold,” or “Sell” are enough. I see RIOT as likely outperforming the broader 3- to 5-year market. I base this on the favorable stance I adopted lately towards crypto and bitcoin, and on my belief RIOT will succeed in its diversification plan. I translate that to the Seeking Alpha rating taxonomy by rating RIOT as a “Buy.”",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800098-despite-2-scary-words-bitcoin-diversification-im-riot-platforms-fan?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|MARKET|TRADING","RIOT",cryptocompare
2025-07-09T12:00:11,"XRP Makes Trump’s Unspoken Crypto Top 5—What You Need To Know","Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) quietly lodged an S-1 with the US Securities and Exchange Commission late on July 8, seeking approval for the “Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF.” Despite a swirl of social-media posts placing the paperwork in early June, the SEC’s time-stamp confirms the filing date as July 8. The prospectus sketches a five-coin portfolio weighted approximately 70 percent to bitcoin, 15 percent to ether, 8 percent to solana, 5 percent to Cronos and 2 percent to XRP, making it the first Trump-branded product to diversify beyond the two largest digital assets. The trust, structured as a Nevada business trust and sponsored by boutique issuer Yorkville America Digital, aims to list its shares on NYSE Arca. Foris DAX Trust — the US institutional arm of Crypto.com — is named digital-asset custodian, while authorized participants will create and redeem blocks of 10,000 shares in kind or for cash, subject to NYSE rule changes. The prospectus also discloses that staking rewards on ether, solana and cronos may be passed through to the fund, a design choice that would set a precedent among US spot-crypto ETFs. Related Reading: Pundit Explains Why XRP Stands To Gain Big From Ripple’s RLUSD Analyst Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg distilled the filing in two succinct posts on X: “New filing for the Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF, which will be a spot crypto basket holding Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, XRP and Cronos,” he wrote; in a follow-up, he reproduced the pivotal language: “the Trust’s allocation… is initially expected to approximate 70% bitcoin, 15% ether, 8% SOL, 5% CRO and 2% XRP.” Those percentages now serve as the market’s working model for how the Trump universe ranks crypto’s ‘blue chips.’ Why Solana, Cronos And XRP? Overall, the allocation may serve as an implicit ranking of the top five crypto assets as viewed through the lens of Trump’s inner circle. Binance top trader by PnL Nachi (@alphawifhat) commented via X: “I think it’s useful to look at the allocation ratio of the Truth Social Crypto ETF I see this as an indication of how Trump’s crypto team looks at the top crypto assets and what are the top 5 they want to value the most. This could be a catalyst to pump CRO as it’s a dark horse.” Solana’s climb to an 8 percent weight is more than a momentum trade. CME Group this spring announced cash-settled Solana futures pending CFTC sign-off, extending the same institutional rails that helped bitcoin and ether graduate into ETF form. Notably, the SEC has set a July deadline for spot Solana ETF refilings, indicating a potential approval before the October 2 deadline. Related Reading: XRP Set To Shock The Crypto Market With 30% Share, Analyst Predicts Cronos leaps over better-capitalized tokens because Crypto.com is literally powering Trump’s ETFs. “We are proud to partner with Trump Media and Yorkville… including the first-of-its-kind basket of tokens featuring CRO,” Crypto.com co-founder Kris Marszalek said in March when the multi-year, roughly $2.7 billion partnership was unveiled. Under the agreement, Crypto.com supplies custody, liquidity and back-end order routing for all Truth-branded funds. XRP brings up the rear at two percent, reflecting both its renewed legitimacy and its still-nascent institutional plumbing. On June 27, Ripple Labs announced that it will withdraw its cross appeal against the SEC. The token’s modest two-percent slice is politicized as much as it is financial. In early March a staffer from Ballard Partners—the K-Street shop that counts Ripple as a client—slipped Donald Trump draft language for a Truth Social post urging that XRP, Solana and Cardano be placed in a national “Crypto Strategic Reserve.” Trump hit “post” and only later discovered the Ripple connection; insiders told Politico he “was furious and felt like he’d been used.” Despite that, the inclusion of XRP still shows Trump’s ties with Ripple. At press time, XRP traded at $2.33.

2025-07-09T11:52:15,"Is the Bitcoin Bull Run Over or Just Getting Started?","The post Is the Bitcoin Bull Run Over or Just Getting Started? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has been making people nervous lately. With price swings and multiple failed attempts to push past $112,000, many are wondering, is the bull run over? Are we entering another bear market? But, according to experienced crypto trader Mags, analysis suggests that Bitcoin may be preparing for another major rally. Bitcoin’s 50-WMA Hints at $130K Level In a recent tweet, Mags pointed out that Bitcoin’s 50-week moving average (50 WMA) has long acted as a strong support level. Whenever Bitcoin touched this line before, it often bounced back and moved higher. Mags’ chart highlights several historical “BUY” signals when Bitcoin touched the 50 WMA and later surged higher. The only “SELL” signal occurred back in early 2022, when BTC failed to hold above the moving average. Since then, the 50 WMA has continued to act as a strong support line. #Bitcoin – Bear market incoming? A lot of people think Bitcoin is heading into a bear market. The easiest way to check?

On-chain Activity Points to Accumulation Adding to this perspective is some recent large-scale on-chain activity. According to crypto analyst Maartunn, over 19,400 BTC, worth around $2.11 billion, were recently moved out of dormant wallets into institutional-grade addresses. These coins had not been touched for three to seven years. Institutional Accumulation Incoming? Three large transactions hit the chain this morning, moving dormant coins into likely institutional wallets: • Tx 1 3y–5y: 8,002 BTC • Tx 2 3y–5y: 2,438 BTC 5y–7y: 6,000 BTC • Tx 3 5y–7y: 3,002 BTC In… pic.twitter.com/pGF4YFkxFb — Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) July 8, 2025 While such moves often hint at strategic selling, it suggests large investors might step in to buy while the price stays steady Short-Term Pressure Still Exists While everything isn’t just bullish yet.

2025-07-09T11:52:12,"Elon Musk’s Tesla Could Have Earned $17 Billion from Bitcoin, Here’s What Went Wrong","The post Elon Musk’s Tesla Could Have Earned $17 Billion from Bitcoin, Here’s What Went Wrong appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News What if Tesla never stopped accepting Bitcoin? According to Tomas Grief, Chief Product Officer at Brainns, the EV giant could have amassed 160,000 BTC, now worth over $17 billion — simply by accepting just 2% of its car sales in Bitcoin since 2021. That stash would now be nearly half of Tesla’s total profits since 2021. Tesla’s $17 Billion What-If Scenario On May 12, 2021, Elon Musk stunned the crypto world. In a now-famous tweet, the Tesla CEO announced the company would suspend accepting Bitcoin for vehicle purchases, citing environmental concerns: “ Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels… but this cannot come at great cost to the environment.” He added Tesla wouldn’t sell its BTC and would reconsider transactions when mining became more sustainable. Here’s What Could Have Happened If Tesla Kept Going In a post on X , Tomas Grief shared a mind-blowing projection: If just 2% of Tesla’s sales since 2021 had been in Bitcoin — and the company held onto the BTC — Tesla would now own around 160,000 BTC. On May 12, 2021 (the day Tesla paused BTC payments), Bitcoin was $56,667 In just 11 days, BTC dropped nearly 39% after the announcement Today, Bitcoin trades around $108,826, up 88.9% year-over-year That 160,000 BTC stash would now be worth over $17 billion To put it in perspective: Tesla has made about $40 billion in profits since 2021. That means their potential BTC stash would have equaled 42.5% of total profit. Why Tesla Paused Bitcoin Payments Musk’s decision came amid rising scrutiny of Bitcoin’s environmental impact: High energy consumption, mostly from fossil fuels Significant carbon emissions and electronic waste Concerns about water and land usage While Bitcoin mining is slowly shifting towards renewables, these sustainability issues remain unresolved, making the tech community divided on its long-term viability. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Is the Bitcoin Bull Run Over or Just Getting Started? , Could Tesla Reconsider Accepting Bitcoin?

2025-07-09T11:50:58,"Traders Eye $110K Bitcoin, but Santiment Warns of Overheated Optimism","Crypto traders are growing confident that Bitcoin could soon reclaim the $110,000 mark, but this rising optimism may not be as bullish as it appears, according to blockchain analytics platform Santiment. Analyst Brian Quinlivan highlighted that excessive retail enthusiasm often precedes local price tops, warning traders to exercise caution even as sentiment indicators flash green. “It’s pretty clear that the crowd is starting to salivate over a potential $110K+ Bitcoin market value,” Quinlivan stated . He explained that trader emotions can often lead to ill-timed decisions, with price action frequently moving against overly bullish retail sentiment. Bullish Sentiment Hits Three-Week High Santiment’s data shows that bullish comments on Bitcoin now outnumber bearish ones by a ratio of 1.51 to 1, the highest reading in the past three weeks. This spike in optimism mirrors previous instances that preceded price corrections, including the declines seen on June 11 and July 7 after similar sentiment surges. On Monday, Bitcoin briefly touched a local high of $109,595 before retracing to $107,681, coinciding with a wave of bullish commentary across social platforms. Quinlivan noted that this pattern aligns with retail investors “buying into the rising momentum” of Bitcoin’s price, which often results in short-term pullbacks. Despite the potential for a near-term correction, Bitcoin remains in an upward trend, currently trading near $108,000, up 2.84% over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin Whale Inactivity Signals Market Caution Quinlivan also pointed out that Bitcoin whale wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC have shown limited movement in recent days, a signal that may warrant caution. “For now, these wallets have been somewhat suspiciously flat,” he said, revealing that whales offloaded 14,140 BTC over the past week, indicating a pause in accumulation. Historically, whale accumulation often happen just before price increases, while periods of distribution or inactivity have signaled upcoming price declines across the crypto market. However, Quinlivan emphasized that the broader outlook remains bullish, with whales and sharks steadily accumulating Bitcoin over the past six months despite short-term market fluctuations. While traders remain eager for Bitcoin to reclaim its all-time high of $111,970 reached on May 22, Santiment suggests that a “mild pullback” could be healthy before a sustained move toward new highs, allowing market momentum to stabilize before the next major leg upward.

2025-07-09T11:50:22,"Bitcoin: Crucial Hesitation as Traders Await New Highs","Are you feeling the palpable tension in the air surrounding the cryptocurrency market? If you’re a crypto enthusiast or a seasoned investor, you’ve likely noticed a significant shift in recent weeks. The once-relentless upward trajectory of Bitcoin seems to have hit a snag, leaving many on the sidelines. This article delves deep into the reasons behind the current market pause, exploring why traders are hesitant to commit to new positions, particularly as the flagship cryptocurrency struggles to break new all-time highs. Understanding Bitcoin’s Current Standoff The cryptocurrency world thrives on momentum, and right now, Bitcoin appears to be in a crucial standoff. After a period of impressive gains, the leading digital asset has found itself consolidating, unable to muster the strength for a decisive push into uncharted territory. This lack of upward velocity is a primary driver of the current market apprehension. Investors who were once eager to ‘buy the dip’ are now questioning whether current price levels offer enough upside potential to justify the risk, especially without clear signals of a renewed bullish trend. Several factors contribute to this perceived lack of momentum: Failure to Secure New All-Time Highs: Each attempt to surpass previous peaks has been met with selling pressure, indicating strong resistance at those levels. Reduced Trading Volume: A noticeable decline in trading volume suggests that fewer participants are actively engaging in the market, leading to thinner order books. Absence of Fresh Capital Inflows: While institutional interest remains, the rate of new significant capital entering the market appears to have slowed, which is vital for sustained rallies. Why Are Crypto Traders Holding Back? The hesitation among Crypto Traders isn’t unfounded; it’s a rational response to prevailing market conditions. Seasoned traders understand that chasing a rally that lacks conviction can lead to significant losses. The current environment is characterized by a mix of profit-taking and a wait-and-see approach. Many who bought Bitcoin at lower prices are now opting to secure their gains, rather than risking them in an uncertain market. For those looking to enter, the absence of a clear breakout signal means that the risk-reward ratio doesn’t appear compelling enough. This cautious stance is influenced by: Profit-Taking Pressures: After substantial runs, it’s natural for investors to lock in profits, especially when the market shows signs of fatigue. Uncertainty Regarding Macro Factors: Global economic signals, inflation concerns, and central bank policies are creating a complex backdrop that makes long-term predictions challenging. Fear of a Deeper Correction: The longer Bitcoin struggles to break out, the greater the concern among traders that a more significant price correction might be on the horizon. Bitfinex’s Insightful Market Analysis A recent market note from leading cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex provides crucial insights into this phenomenon. Their analysts have observed a clear unwillingness or inability among bulls to push BTC prices higher without new catalysts or clear macro signals. This observation underscores the sentiment that the market isn’t just pausing; it’s actively waiting for something significant to happen before committing to a direction. According to Bitfinex analysts, the market is experiencing: Market Dynamic Bitfinex Analysis Profit-Taking Pressure “Mitigating profit-taking pressure” suggests that while some profit-taking is occurring, it’s not overwhelming, but enough to cap upward movement. Buying Appetite “Coupled with a lack of buying appetite” indicates that new money isn’t rushing in to absorb the selling pressure or push prices higher. Catalyst Requirement Bulls need “new catalysts or clear macro signals” to regain confidence and drive the price upwards. This analysis from Bitfinex highlights a critical juncture where the market is less about fear or greed and more about patience and anticipation. Navigating the Current Market Sentiment The prevailing Market Sentiment is one of caution and consolidation. Unlike the euphoric phases where every dip was seen as a buying opportunity, the current mood is more reflective and strategic. This period of lower volatility and sideways movement can be frustrating for active traders, but it also presents an opportunity for investors to re-evaluate their portfolios and strategies. Understanding the underlying sentiment is key to making informed decisions. Key aspects of the current market sentiment include: Lack of Conviction: Neither bulls nor bears have seized definitive control, leading to range-bound trading. Focus on Fundamentals: With price action stalled, more attention is being paid to Bitcoin’s network health, adoption rates, and regulatory developments. Anticipation of Macro Shifts: The market is keenly watching global economic indicators, central bank decisions, and geopolitical events for clues about future direction. This phase is a test of patience for many, emphasizing the importance of a long-term perspective over short-term fluctuations. What’s Next for BTC? Identifying Potential Catalysts For BTC to break free from its current range and achieve a new all-time high, it will likely require significant catalysts. These could come from various sources, both internal to the crypto ecosystem and from the broader macroeconomic environment. Identifying these potential triggers is crucial for investors trying to anticipate the next big move. Potential catalysts include: Clear Macroeconomic Signals: A definitive shift in inflation trends, interest rate policies, or global economic growth could provide the clarity investors seek. Increased Institutional Adoption: Major corporations or financial institutions announcing significant Bitcoin holdings or new crypto-related products could inject fresh enthusiasm. Regulatory Clarity: Positive or clear regulatory frameworks in major economies could reduce uncertainty and encourage broader participation. Technological Advancements: Significant upgrades or developments within the Bitcoin network or the broader crypto space could renew interest. Halving Event Anticipation: While still some time away, the next Bitcoin halving will eventually start to factor into long-term price models, though its immediate impact is less relevant for current hesitation. Without such catalysts, the market may continue to consolidate, reflecting the hesitant stance of traders and investors. Conclusion: Navigating the Waiting Game The current market landscape, marked by trader hesitation and Bitcoin’s struggle to achieve new highs, is a testament to the evolving maturity of the cryptocurrency space. As highlighted by Bitfinex’s analysis, the market is in a crucial waiting game, anticipating catalysts that can ignite the next major rally. This period of consolidation is not necessarily a sign of weakness, but rather a reflection of a more discerning investor base demanding clearer signals before committing capital. For those invested in BTC , patience and a keen eye on both on-chain metrics and global macroeconomic trends will be paramount. The next surge, when it comes, will likely be driven by a confluence of factors that restore confidence and provide the necessary momentum for Bitcoin to once again claim new territory.

2025-07-09T11:45:05,"BlackRock Suddenly Snubs US Government Bonds, Shifting to This Geography Amid Sticky Inflation Concerns: Report","The world’s largest asset manager has reportedly turned on US Treasuries. In a report seen by Bloomberg , BlackRock Investment Institute strategists recently upgraded their view on European government bonds from slightly underweight to neutral, comparing them positively to US government debt obligations. BlackRock also notes that the Federal Reserve may hold back on cutting interest rates due to sticky inflation, while high budget deficits might urge investors to ask for a higher yield premium to hold long-dated US bonds. “We prefer euro area government bonds and credit over the US. Yields are attractive, and term premium has risen closer to our expectations relative to US Treasuries.” The BlackRock strategists specifically highlight bonds from Italy and Spain. The asset manager isn’t the only financial giant to take a less optimistic view of US Treasuries. Goldman Sachs market strategists also recently lowered their forecasts for US Treasury yields on the basis that the Federal Reserve will most likely begin cutting interest rates sooner than expected. Goldman’s economists originally predicted the Fed would only enact one rate cut near the end of the year, but they are now expecting cuts in September, October and December. The Financial Times recently reported that $11 billion in US long-term bond funds focused on government and corporate debt were sold in only three months. The second quarter sell-off ends a three-year run of net inflows into long-term US bond funds, with the previous sell-off occurring in 2022 Q2.

Strategic Partnership Details: Millions of Users Can Now Pay With Crypto Ramesh Cidambi, Managing Director of Dubai Duty Free, and Mohammed Al Hakim, President of UAE Operations at Crypto.com, formalized the partnership at Emirates Headquarters in the presence of Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, as per the press release. Beyond payment integration, the MoU encompasses strategic collaborations, including joint marketing campaigns and customer engagement programs, designed to leverage the strengths of both organizations. “ This MoU underscores our commitment to innovation and to providing greater convenience and choice for our customers ,” Cidambi stated, emphasizing how this crypto payments integration will add significant value for Dubai Duty Free’s diverse international customer base. Eric Anziani, President and COO of Crypto.com, shared similar excitement. He highlighted the partnership’s role in expanding everyday crypto use cases, stating it will “ bring real momentum to the digital asset industry ” while enabling both companies to offer genuine innovative finance solutions. Dubai Duty Free aims to provide a robust foundation for implementing crypto payments, driven by its strong financial performance during the first half of 2025, with a turnover of AED 4.118 billion (US$1.128 billion), representing a 5.34% year-over-year increase. The collaboration builds on the company’s history of embracing cutting-edge payment technologies, having previously integrated solutions like Alipay and TerraPay to create a future-ready ecosystem for global travel retail. Both parties will now begin feasibility studies and detailed planning to implement crypto payment solutions and roll out collaborative initiatives under the agreement. Growing Momentum in Global Crypto Adoption Dubai Duty Free’s crypto integration complements the UAE’s digital transformation strategy, which has already yielded a successful partnership with Crypto.com for government service payments and Dubai’s Islamic Bank for Sharia-compliant products. Dubai has signed an agreement with global crypto exchange @cryptocom to enable cryptocurrency payments for government services. #Dubai #Crypto https://t.co/Ei4F5lpzAI — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 13, 2025 The timing coincides with growing global momentum for crypto payments in travel, as demonstrated by Bhutan’s recent implementation of a national-level crypto tourism payment system in partnership with Binance Pay. Dubai’s regulatory clarity and pro-crypto stance are attracting businesses amid the EU’s stringent MiCA regulations, which have prompted crypto firms to seek more favorable jurisdictions . The UAE’s vision of achieving 90% cashless transactions by 2026, as outlined in its Cashless Strategy, creates an ideal environment for the adoption of cryptocurrency payments. Government officials estimate that the digital payment transition could add at least 8 billion dirhams to the local economy. However, security concerns remain a significant barrier to widespread cryptocurrency payment adoption, with 37% of users citing hacks and fraud as the primary obstacles, according to recent industry research. As Dubai Duty Free serves millions of international travelers annually, the partnership could further accelerate mainstream cryptocurrency adoption by demonstrating practical, everyday use cases that extend beyond current applications.

2025-07-09T11:34:52,"Ripple Taps The Oldest US Bank to Custody RLUSD","The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BNY Mellon) continues to serve as a global partner for different cryptocurrency-related initiatives, and the latest involves Ripple and its recently launched stablecoin. According to a press release by the company, the oldest bank in the US will serve as a custodian for RLUSD. The statement reads that both parties are “jointly committed to paving the way for digital asset adoption at institutional scale, and together, are bridging the gap between traditional finance and crypto.” RLUSD saw the light of day at the end of last year when the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) gave the green light. It’s now one of the few global stablecoins issued under the agency’s Trust Company Charter. It is pegged to the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio, and it is backed by “high-quality liquid assets,” the company stated. Unlike other stablecoins, RLUSD is not focused on retail engagement. Instead, it has been “purpose-built for enterprise utility, particularly in improving the speed, cost, and efficiency of cross-border payments.” “As primary custodian for RLUSD, we’re proud to support the growth of digital assets by providing a differentiated platform, designed to meet the evolving needs of institutions in the digital assets ecosystem,” commented Emily Portney, Global Head of Asset Servicing at BNY. In addition to the collaboration for RLUSD custody, Ripple will also utilize BNY’s transaction banking services to “underpin its operations and continue delivering seamless solutions for its customers.” BNY was one of the first US banks to dip its toes in the cryptocurrency market years ago, well before the country’s political and regulatory landscape became as favorable as it is now. Since the early COVID days, the institution has launched several BTC and crypto-related products and provides custody to certain digital asset firms, such as Grayscale .

On July 7, a crypto investment company, Paradigm , joined the alliance and filed an amicus brief , challenging the DOJ’s attack on software developers publishing open source code. Crypto Firm Coalition Against DOJ Paradigm reported on Monday that it has joined forces with— DeFi Education Fund, alongside the Blockchain Association, Crypto Council for Innovation, the Digital Chamber, the Solana Policy Institute, the Bitcoin Policy Institute, and the Uniswap Foundation— to support plaintiff, Michael Lewellen. Lewellen, the developer who created a non-custodial crypto protocol and wanted to make it publicly available, merely published the code, which is not a money transmission, contrary to what the DOJ accused him of. Why the Crypto Firms are Fighting Against the DOJ? The crypto group coalition called the Department of Justice’s prosecution unfair and accused it of misusing section 1960 of the Title 18 of the US Code. In their filing, the coalition reported that the government is actively prosecuting P2P crypto software, even when the developers are publishing open-source software. Developers who followed the rules, consulted lawyers, and relied on government guidance are also finding themselves at the risk of indictment or are facing trials like Roman Storm. Emphasizing the wrongdoing of the DOJ, Paradigm stated– “We filed the brief because the government’s position is not just wrong on the law; it threatens the future of neutral crypto infrastructure in the United States and will send innovation fleeing overseas.” Urging the Government to Maintain Clarity in Laws The crypto group coalition urged the government to give more clarity on the DOJ laws before prosecuting. Without clarity, developers will keep facing penalties and imprisonment, halting innovation in the US. The amicus brief submitted by the coalition defines unlicensed illegal money transmitting, which, according to the crypto firms, was not committed by Lewellen. Final Thought The crypto group coalition believed that people would lose faith in the US law if it does not provide clarity before executing charges. It will also confuse the developers to understand what falls under legal circumstances and what doesn’t. If this harsh and illogical regime continues, many developers will start to flee overseas to continue their innovative work.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-firms-fight-doj-over-developer-code-crackdown/,"REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|SOL","News",cryptocompare

Saylor thinks regulatory hindrances will affect altcoins’ growth. The altcoin market has experienced an upsurge since the beginning of H2, 2025. The altcoin market has surged 16% in the past few weeks, a sharp rebound that directly challenges the long-held, skeptical view of influential Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor.

2025-07-09T11:15:00,"Tariffs Don't Budge Bitcoin, PNUT Pops on Musk Rant: Crypto Daybook Americas","By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin (BTC) is hovering around $108,600, pretty much unchanged over 24 hours. The broader CoinDesk 20 ( CD20 ) index added 1.8%, shrugging off the uncertainty surrounding President Trump’s recent tariff threats against various countries. President Donald Trump sent letters to 14 nations, including key partners in Asia, warning that tariffs will be applied starting Aug. 1 unless they make concessions to the U.S. when it comes to trade. Trump also said he will impose a 50% tariff on imported copper and up to 200% on pharmaceuticals. Traditional markets were also muted in their responses. U.S. equity indexes were flat in yesterday’s session, while Europe opened with a slight upward momentum and Asian indexes closed higher. The U.S. dollar index is pretty much unchanged. The market’s reaction suggests the so-called TACO — Trump always chickens out — trade is still in play. It's a reference to the president’s negotiation pattern, in which tariffs are announced and then reversed. That's even after he s aid “there will be no change” to next month's deadline. Still, past tariff announcements stoked inflation concerns, and this latest one comes as the Federal Reserve tightens liquidity to the tune of $40 billion a month , according to analysts at crypto hedge fund QCP Capital. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has warned that tariff‑driven price spikes might delay any rate cuts, which would make risk assets like crypto less attractive for investors. Nevertheless, earlier scares of a U.S. recession have cooled, with perceived odds of that happening this year dropping to 20% on Polymarket , the lowest since January. Over the past week, cryptocurrency investment products brought in nearly $1 billion in net inflows, according to CoinShares data, pushing total assets to a record $188 billion . Bitcoin funds captured the lion’s share of those flows, with ether, solana and XRP funds logging solid demand. Combined with a stream of corporate treasuries raising funds to buy bitcoin, demand remains elevated for the leading cryptocurrency. Apart from exceptions like PNUT and some Grok-influenced memecoins, other altcoins aren’t faring as well. Bitcoin’s dominance has risen nearly 12% year-to-date to now account for roughly 65% of the ecosystem's total market capitalization. Whether the TACO trade will hold its merit ahead of the August deadline remains to be seen. Stay alert!

PNUT jumped over 10% within minutes and saw 24-hour trading volumes more than triple to $214 million, according to CoinGecko data, as traders rushed in on the name-drop. The token has no affiliation with Musk or the squirrel and no underlying utility. It trades purely on cultural resonance and speculative momentum. A separate, AI-driven event took hold after Grok, the chatbot on X, hallucinated a bizarre response referencing “MechaHitler,” “GigaPutin” and “CyberStalin” — terms that quickly went viral. Within hours, over 200 MechaHitler-themed tokens had launched across Solana and Ethereum, with the largest on Bonk.fun hitting a $2.2 million market cap and over $1 million in early volume, DEXTools data shows. At least one Ethereum-based version touched a $500,000 market cap, highlighting how quickly speculative capital chases meme narratives. The episode highlights how AI-generated content — even hallucinatory or unhinged — is now a legitimate trigger for on-chain trading activity, rivaling traditional influencer-driven pump-and-dump schemes. Grok later walked back the comment, clarifying the name referred to a 1990s video game character from Wolfenstein 3D and was meant as satire, not endorsement. Derivatives Positioning The cumulative notional open interest in ether USDT and dollar-denominated perpetuals listed on major exchanges has risen above 5 million ETH, the highest since June 20, alongside positive funding rates to suggest a bias for long positions. BTC perpetuals remain as dull as the spot price. XRP's open interest holds steady near five-month highs, also exhibiting a bullish market sentiment. On Deribit, options market activity shows $110K as price magnet for BTC and $3.20 as the focus for XRP. BTC and ETH 25-delta risk reversals showed a mildly bullish bias across tenors. Block flows featured a BTC calendar spread and a long put position in the July 18 expiry put at the $106K strike financed by writing the same expiry $108K strike call.

2025-07-09T11:05:27,"Time is running out for Bitcoin’s parabolic rally, warns analyst","Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) ability to mount a parabolic rally may be fading based on its technical indicators, according to a trading expert. In this line, analysis by TradingShot suggests that another major rally could be limited by Bitcoin’s position within a well-defined long-term uptrend that has yet to produce the kind of rallies seen in the past cycles. In a TradingView post on July 9, the analyst noted that since bottoming in November 2022, Bitcoin has traded within an upward channel that closely aligns with a Fibonacci channel guiding price movements since 2013. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Despite short-term pullbacks, the overall trend remains intact and is technically targeting a new higher high. Notably, most of this cycle has occurred in the ‘buy zone’ of the Fibonacci channel. Historically, major rallies have followed breakouts from this zone. For instance, in the 2017 and 2021 cycles, such breakouts triggered rapid, exponential moves into the upper Fibonacci bands, delivering significant gains. So far, TradingShot stressed that this cycle has not produced a similar breakout. To this end, Bitcoin recently tested resistance near its all-time high but failed to hold above it. What’s next for Bitcoin? At the same time, the expert warned that if Bitcoin is to follow its traditional four-year cycle pattern, driven by the supply shock from the halving time, it may be running out of time to deliver a comparable parabolic move before the cycle matures. “So far, we haven’t got such rally on the current Cycle and with time running out (assuming the 4-year Cycle model continues to hold), do you think we will get one this time around?” the analyst said. The analysis suggested potential price targets between $280,000 and $530,000 if Bitcoin can replicate its historical breakout pattern, with key technical indicators aligning with the 50- and 200-week moving averages ( MA ). Bitcoin price analysis At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $108,777, up approximately 0.25% in the last 24 hours, having largely remained in a state of consolidation over the past week.

While some team members had concerns, the company’s board fully agreed that investing in Bitcoin could boost long-term value and keep the business flexible for future opportunities. リミックスポイント本日開示 ファイナンスにて約315億円資金調達 資金使途、全額BTC取得 目先『3000BTC保有』を目指す ※BTC価格、株価により変動あり （初回以降は3日連続取引日の平均株価） 背景 より一層ビットコインの未来に確信を 持ち、議論を重ねた結果となります。… — リミックスポイント公式Xアカウント (@remixpoint_x) July 9, 2025 Remixpoint’s decision to use Bitcoin is not just a random move; it shows how more companies in Japan are starting to trust Bitcoin as part of their main business plans. Remixpoint CEO Chooses Full Bitcoin Salary On top of that, Takashi Tashiro, the new CEO of Remixpoint , has decided to get his entire salary in Bitcoin. Tashiro wants to prove he’s fully invested in the company’s future, just like its shareholders. Instead of the usual bank transfer, Remixpoint will first figure out his salary and taxes in Japanese yen. Then, they’ll buy the same amount in Bitcoin and send it straight to a crypto wallet that Tashiro picks himself. More Firms Turning to Bitcoin In Sweden, health tech firm H100 Group is following a similar path. The company recently raised 516 million kronor (about $54 million) in two new funding rounds. This brings its total raised capital to 921 million kronor. H100 already holds 248 BTC and plans to use the new funds to grow its Bitcoin holdings as part of its overall treasury strategy. Meanwhile, LQWD Technologies from Canada is also boosting its Bitcoin reserves. The company increased its financing round to C$12.3 million (about $9 million). However, currently it owns 181 BTC and says the new funds will help expand its Bitcoin-based operations.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/japanese-firms-remixpoint-joins-bitcoin-treasury-with-215m-buy-plan/,"BTC|REGULATION|ASIA|BUSINESS|FIAT","News",cryptocompare
2025-07-09T11:01:04,"Riot Platforms Looks Good Heading Into Year-End","Summary Upgrading RIOT to a Buy due to a strong crypto market outlook, relatively fixed mining costs, low valuation, and a compelling technical setup. Riot Platforms' business model is incredibly scalable when Bitcoin prices stay and rise beyond profitability thresholds. Valuation remains attractive at 1.4x P/B, well below historical averages, with potential upside over 100% if sentiment improves. This is a speculative, high-risk play with significant downside if Bitcoin crashes, not a long-term hold—take profits on strength. Introduction Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) has gained a lot of traction in recent weeks. On May 5, I published an article on RIOT with a Hold rating. If I helped motivate existing shareholders to hold, great, but in retrospective, the best course of action would have been to iterate a Buy, as the stock has outperformed the S&P 500 by 4X since that article went live. Seeking Alpha This comes as Bitcoin has seen impressive relative strength the last few months as well, after recovering quickly from its April lows. It is currently just 3.5% off its ATH and looks like it wants to reach a few new ones this year. TradingView Revenue growth has seen improvements for three consecutive quarters in a row, but so have expenses. Simultaneously, RIOT is scaling their energized hashrate (E/H), aiming for 38 E/H at the end of 2025. Combining efficiency gains with Bitcoin prices at or above profitability thresholds makes Riot Platforms' business very scalable, at least for this year, as cycle theory suggests a rough 2026 . For RIOT to be profitable, I estimate that average Bitcoin prices need to remain above $100k, which is a safety margin added on top of their Q1 2025 $81k average cost to mine one Bitcoin, including miner depreciation. Further appreciation of Bitcoin will flow to RIOT's bottom line, be it from net proceeds from Bitcoin mining or unrealized gains from their treasury strategy, which is why they are so compelling for investors expecting the crypto market rally to continue. Macrotrends Their Bitcoin HODL stack is growing while they continue to sell most (but not all) of their produced Bitcoins. In an update on June production , of the 450 produced BTC, 48 went into their stack, which reached 19,273 BTC. At $108k, this adds up to a value of $2.1B and already makes up roughly 50% of their market cap. My goal with this article is to touch on my previous analysis and analyze RIOT fundamentally as well as technically. After having done so, I am upgrading Riot Platform to a Buy, due to strong cryptocurrency market outlooks for this year, costs to mine remaining fixed, a low valuation, and a strong technical setup. Valuation RIOT is a hardware-heavy business due to all the servers they need to facilitate their bitcoin mining. Combining this with the fact that RIOT's phases of profitability occur very seldom and revenues are highly cyclical, I believe the P/B ratio is best for a multiples valuation. They're currently trading at a level of 1.4X, which is significantly lower than their 5-year average of 2.9X. Mining risk could be priced in as a P/B ratio close to one, which suggests the market distrusts the business' capability of generating earnings. If the assets of a business can be sold (in total) for what the company is worth, there can't be high (or any) expectations of net income production, as that would result in a large earnings yield and make the company undervalued. Data by YCharts They are leaning more into AI/HPC , though, which supports more predictable revenue and no surge in expenses every four years like the Bitcoin halving causes. This might in fact not be fully priced in. I therefore believe that amid a continued crypto rally that lightens up investor sentiment for miners like Riot Platforms, their P/B could reach the set average again, which offers upside potential north of 100%. Technical Analysis The technical analysis I shared in my last article (depicted below) was decently accurate, as I saw short-term upside potential to around $14. In actuality, the price recently ended up at $12.7, supported by a lot of momentum. TradingView (Previous Analysis) Since then, I slightly adjusted the descending resistance so it has more points of connection. The momentum of the recent rise can be seen in the weekly RSI reaching highs of 63. Levels like this usually lead to short-term corrections, so nothing to worry about here. In addition to the RSI, price was also rejected from this newly adjusted trendline. Price action of recent weeks has built an uptrend that is clearly confirmed by higher highs and higher lows. A slight pullback now is healthy and does not negate the set uptrend if it does not form a lower low. Currently, it is far from doing so. TradingView Zooming in to the daily chart, the uptrend becomes more apparent, as RIOT currently trades above the 50-200 EMAs. A new support line has been formed from the lows, which can help both maintain the structure and lead to increased appreciation as well as guide us on where price could go in 2025. Following this trend, I estimate RIOT could reach $16 per share, which implies and upside potential of 39%. This poses as my minimum price target. TradingView Needless to say, this is not a play on technical undervaluation but rather one on trend continuation, as price is more overbought than before but the current uptrend remains intact. Risks With this name, associated risks are elevated, especially when I am recommending a Buy after a strong performance following my previous Hold rating. Valuation metrics have obviously gone up but are still on the cheaper end. The biggest risk remains Bitcoin volatility. I expect Bitcoin to experience a significant drop (60%+) in 2026 following cycle theory, but it remains just a theory after all. Such a crash could happen anytime, including this year. That would wipe out my whole investment thesis, as RIOT would have to go back to reporting huge losses and dilute shareholders more heavily. Losses on their Bitfarms investments might also offset this year's profitability, as they're currently sitting on about $130M in unrealized losses. Conclusion At current prices, RIOT is a speculative Buy. Revenue growth seems solid; they are increasing efficiency; mining costs should stay somewhat flat - all while Bitcoin is set to reach new ATHs this year, skyrocketing their mining revenues and HODL stack's unrealized gains. At a low valuation and supported by a technical uptrend, this can lead to explosive returns in the coming months. I do feel the need to highlight that this is only for investors with a large appetite for risk. I also want to reiterate that this rating by no means constitutes a buy-and-hold recommendation, as I am convinced RIOT is not a good long-term investment. Take some profits on the way up.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800084-riot-platforms-looks-good-into-year-end?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|MINING","RIOT",cryptocompare
2025-07-09T11:00:52,"Japanese Firm to Test Bitcoin and XRP Redemption Via Credit Card Points","Japan is once again at the forefront of cryptocurrency adoption . A new initiative will enable users of Aplus, a credit card service under the Shinsei Bank Group, to redeem their loyalty points for digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP. The development, shared by prominent crypto commentator Xaif on X, reflects a growing trend in the country to integrate crypto into mainstream financial services. The program is being launched through a partnership between Aplus and SBI VC Trade, the crypto exchange arm of SBI Holdings, one of Japan’s largest financial conglomerates and a long-time proponent of XRP. According to official sources, the redemption scheme will allow users to convert Aplus Points into BTC, XRP, and ETH, with a conversion rate that values 2,100 points at approximately ¥2,000 worth of crypto. The feature will be made available via a user-friendly interface integrated into the existing cardholder platform. JUST IN: Japanese Firm to Test Bitcoin and $XRP Redemption Via Credit Card Points pic.twitter.com/j2Ch9N0rGj — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) July 9, 2025 Bringing Crypto Into Everyday Finance This pilot marks a significant evolution in how Japanese consumers interact with digital assets. Rather than earning crypto rewards on new purchases, as seen in earlier initiatives like Gemini’s XRP cashback credit card, users can now redeem their already accumulated points for top-tier cryptocurrencies. This approach lowers the barrier for mainstream users to access crypto, turning everyday credit card use into a gateway for digital investment. SBI’s involvement also adds weight to the program’s potential. The company has been at the forefront of XRP adoption in Japan , and its strategic moves have already brought Ripple-based infrastructure to over 70% of the country’s banking sector. With plans to hit 80% coverage by the end of 2025, this new consumer-level integration through Aplus is a natural extension of SBI’s broader vision. Why XRP Is a Central Piece While Bitcoin remains the most recognized name in crypto, XRP’s role in this initiative is especially notable. Known for its speed and low-cost transactions, XRP is already being used by Japanese banks for cross-border payments via RippleNet and xRapid. By enabling Aplus users to redeem points for XRP, the program strengthens XRP’s presence in the consumer finance ecosystem and may increase its real-world usage. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 SBI Holdings President Yoshitaka Kitao has often emphasized XRP’s utility over Bitcoin’s store-of-value appeal, calling it better suited for practical financial transactions. This pilot reinforces that stance, positioning XRP not just as an asset for traders but as a functional part of everyday digital finance. What This Means Going Forward For consumers, the program offers an easy and risk-free entry into the world of crypto. Instead of traditional redemptions such as gift cards or airline miles, cardholders can now choose to convert their loyalty rewards into valuable digital assets. For the industry, this move signals a shift: crypto is no longer confined to exchanges or investment platforms; it’s entering daily financial behavior. As the pilot unfolds, its success could pave the way for similar programs across Japan and globally. With strong institutional backing and user-friendly design, the initiative may be the first of many to blur the line between traditional banking and decentralized finance.

2025-07-09T10:53:52,"Trump's Tariff Threat Fails to Move the Needle on Fed Interest Rate Expectations","U.S. President Donald Trump has intensified his tariff rhetoric this week, but financial markets aren't convinced, likely expecting the President to back down and eventually reach a compromise with trading partners. Earlier this week, the Trump administration sent out letters to 14 countries, warning of higher tariffs on their export of goods to the U.S. starting on Aug. 1. The original 90-day pause on tariffs was set to expire on July 9. On Tuesday, Trump stated on Truth Social that the Aug. 1 deadline won't be extended and new tariffs will go into effect on that day. However, markets seem to believe the adage that Trump always chicken out (TACO), as evident from the steady interest rate expectations in the U.S. As of writing, the CME's FedWatch tool showed expectations for two 25 basis point rate cuts this year, with the first to come through in September. Markets priced out the July rate cut following Friday's hotter-than-expected jobs report and the hawkish repricing has held steady in the wake of Trump's tariff threat. At the same time, there seems to be little-to-no fear about a tariff-led spike in inflation, else traders might have priced out the September rate cut as well. That's in stark contrast to March when Trump's tariff threats saw traders price rapid fire rate cuts, starting from June this year. Perhaps, traders expect the deadline to be suspended indefinitely, leading to negotiations and eventual trade deals, as ForexLive noted . The MOVE index, which measures the options-based 30-day implied volatility in the U.S. Treasury notes, continues to trend lower as opposed to early this year when trade war fears and fiscal concerns saw the index rise from 86.00 to 139.00 in two months to early April. The U.S. equity markets and bitcoin (BTC) aren't paying heed to Trump's threat either. On Monday, the S&P 500 dropped 0.8% to 6,210 points and quickly stabilized Tuesday at 6,225. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, continues to trade lackluster above $105,000, CoinDesk data show. Both markets peaked in February and trended lower as the first round of tariffs war unfolded in March and early April. Lastly, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major currencies, rose 0.55% to 97.60 Monday and has since stabilized around these levels, topping the bearish trendline from the Feb. 3 highs.

2025-07-09T10:49:45,"Tether’s Bold Play: Aiming to Become the World’s Largest Bitcoin Miner This Year","Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino revealed that the company is on track to become “probably the biggest miner in the world” by the end of 2025. Ardoino acknowledged that, in most cases, direct BTC investment yields higher profits than mining, but emphasized Tether’s strategic choice to participate in mining to protect its treasury and support Bitcoin’s network security. Bitcoin Mining Supremacy In a recent interview with Bankless, Ardoino explained that the stablecoin issuer already holds significant Bitcoin reserves and therefore has an incentive to contribute to the network’s decentralization through mining operations across South America, the United States, and other regions. Ardoino highlighted the importance of maintaining a mining presence in the US during what he described as a “monumental time” for the industry. On profitability, the exec noted that while block rewards will eventually drop to zero, on-chain fees are expected to rise significantly, which will turn the Bitcoin main chain into a settlement layer for Lightning channels and major contracts. He suggested that these contracts would underpin an “enormous amount” of transactions. In line with Tether’s broader efforts to promote decentralization, it announced plans to open-source its Bitcoin Mining OS (MOS) last month to help new miners enter the market without costly vendor reliance. Ardoino had then described MOS as scalable, modular, and built on peer-to-peer IoT architecture, which is designed to support existing mining infrastructure like containers and power devices. The rollout is expected by the fourth quarter of 2025. The exec said this move would help more companies to compete in securing the Bitcoin network. Earlier, the company partnered with Ocean mining pool to decentralize block building by committing its current and future hash rate to the protocol. Tether’s Gold Reserves Alongside its aggressive mining ambitions, Tether has been quietly expanding its reserve strategy beyond Bitcoin. In fact, Ardoino recently revealed that the firm holds approximately $8 billion in gold, which is around 80 tonnes, in a Swiss vault he described as “the most secure vault in the world.” The exec added that Tether owns nearly the entire stockpile, which makes it one of the largest private gold holders globally. Gold now comprises almost 5% of Tether’s $112 billion reserves, on par with UBS’s precious‑metals holdings.

2025-07-09T10:45:31,"The 7 Best Altcoins for Next Bull Run According to Q3 2025 Price Activity","While headlines keep circling the same old names, early adopters are now shifting their focus to altcoins showing real technical strength and traction in Q3 2025. With market activity climbing, price movements are hinting at what could potentially lead the charge when the next full bull run kicks off. From decentralized AI to cross-chain operability, the most promising altcoins are quietly stacking gains and expanding use cases. One such name that has moved aggressively from presale to all-time high is Qubetics , a new entrant already making noise with its cross-chain wallet and robust validator rewards. In this guide, Qubetics is analyzed alongside other top-performing altcoins showing strong signals right now. These eight picks aren’t about hype, they’re backed by rising utility, strategic integrations, and growing community support. Whether it’s Stacks reshaping Bitcoin DeFi or Immutable X bringing Web3 to gaming, this article breaks down the most compelling altcoins right now. This is where the best altcoins for next bull run start to reveal themselves, and where early positions could turn into serious returns. 1. Qubetics (Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet Is Changing the Game) Qubetics is reshaping digital finance with a real utility wallet that doesn’t just hold assets, it connects them. The Qubetics Wallet functions as a non-custodial, multi-chain application, compatible across mobile (iOS/Android) and desktop platforms. It provides virtual Visa and Mastercard debit card support, a cross-chain interface, and tokenized bandwidth incentives. More than just another storage solution, it’s built to empower users through control, privacy, and accessibility. Virtual cards can be created within the wallet to facilitate secure online purchases, while Apple Pay and Google Pay integration allows fast retail usage in the real world. One of the standout real-world examples is the seamless conversion feature embedded in the app. When users transact using $TICS tokens, the wallet instantly converts them into USDT or USDC at the point of sale, ensuring stability for merchants and frictionless crypto-to-fiat commerce for buyers. This real-world transaction support reinforces Qubetics’ long-term viability in a crowded crypto economy, where speed and trust matter. This project isn’t simply building wallets, it’s enabling entire ecosystems to interact across chains without KYC or high fees. That’s one reason it’s now widely seen as one of the best altcoins for next bull run . Qubetics Launch Data Shows High Early Returns and Solid Market Floor Qubetics has not just introduced advanced tools, it has delivered results that are drawing attention from both seasoned crypto traders and new participants. At launch, the token surged from $0.40 to $4.20 within the first hour, marking a 950% spike. Early presale backers who entered at $0.01 saw up to 420x returns, making Qubetics one of the rare cases of early access translating into real, fast-tracked profit. Consider this: a $5,000 allocation at the $0.01 presale rate would’ve secured 500,000 $TICS. At its ATH of $4.20, that stack would have been worth $2.1 million, showing the real impact of early conviction. Over $18.4 million was raised across 28,500+ contributors during the presale, with 517 million tokens distributed. Post-launch, Qubetics registered over $700,000 in trade volume on MEXC within the first 24 hours. Its Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) model strengthens this foundation. Validators earn 30% APY, while delegators with a minimum of 5,000 $TICS earn a share of those rewards, creating a powerful loop of participation and passive earning. With a solid $2 support level and high buy pressure, analysts are already revising their projections upward, suggesting a possible target of $10 to $15 after full mainnet deployment. Why This Coin Made it to This List: Its early performance, real-world interoperability, and passive earning model powered by Delegated Proof of Stake ( DPoS ) make Qubetics one of the best altcoins for next bull run. 2. Stacks (Bringing DeFi to Bitcoin) Stacks continues to gain attention for its push to make Bitcoin programmable. By enabling smart contracts and decentralized apps (dApps) on top of Bitcoin, Stacks unlocks DeFi functionality that Bitcoin natively lacks. Q3 has shown a marked uptick in developer activity, wallet creation, and TVL (total value locked) within the ecosystem, signaling growing adoption. Stacks’ anchor to Bitcoin offers a degree of stability not often seen in other L1 smart contract platforms. The Clarity smart contract language ensures predictability and reduces vulnerabilities, making it an appealing choice for long-term builders. Integration with new Layer 2 solutions also keeps transactions efficient and scalable, essential for user growth. Why This Coin Made it to This List: With DeFi finally arriving on Bitcoin through Stacks, its protocol could see mass usage during a bull cycle, putting it among the best altcoins for next bull run. 3. Arweave (Permanent Storage for On-Chain Data) Arweave isn’t trying to replace existing blockchains, it’s solving the long-term problem of decentralized data storage. It provides permanent storage on-chain, which is already being used by NFT projects, DAOs, and even news publications to secure content forever. Q3 activity reflects new institutional-level interest and integrations, suggesting that its tech is being taken more seriously than ever before. The protocol relies on its unique “blockweave” structure, which allows nodes to store a randomized subset of old blocks, cutting down on redundant storage while still ensuring data availability. As decentralized content networks grow, Arweave’s ability to timestamp and lock content permanently is becoming vital. Why This Coin Made it to This List: Its use case is critical to scaling Web3’s infrastructure, making it a strong contender among the best altcoins for next bull run. 4. Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance (ASIA) Formed by the merger of Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol, and SingularityNET, the Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance is building a decentralized AI ecosystem that avoids corporate centralization. This coalition is working toward developing a shared intelligence framework that enables private AI agents to exchange value, resources, and logic on-chain. Q3 has seen significant cross-project collaboration and token utility enhancement, including resource pooling and interchain agent protocols. The collaboration also expands the individual networks’ reach, driving more value into the unified ASI token. By integrating machine learning with blockchain transparency, ASIA is addressing issues in both ecosystems. Why This Coin Made it to This List: With AI’s importance growing, a decentralized model like ASIA positions itself at the right intersection of data sovereignty and tech advancement, marking it as one of the best altcoins for next bull run. 5. Immutable X (Scalable NFT Gaming Infrastructure) Immutable X remains a leader in Ethereum Layer 2 scaling for gaming and NFTs. By enabling zero gas fees and near-instant settlement for digital assets, it solves the core issue of congestion and cost on Ethereum’s mainnet. Q3 partnerships with gaming studios and retail brands confirm that real-world adoption is progressing steadily. The project uses StarkWare’s ZK-rollup tech to batch transactions off-chain and publish them on Ethereum without compromising security. The seamless user experience, especially for gamers unfamiliar with gas fees or wallet complexities, gives it a unique foothold. Why This Coin Made it to This List: With blockchain gaming heating up again, Immutable X is ready to capture that volume, placing it among the best altcoins for next bull run. 6. Hedera (Enterprise Grade Blockchain Utility) Hedera Hashgraph is pushing boundaries by offering enterprise-grade solutions with unmatched transaction finality and network throughput. Backed by governing council members including Google and IBM, its native service for tokenization and consensus is already being used by Fortune 500 companies. In Q3 2025, Hedera saw more integration in tokenized real-world asset experiments, driving institutional attention. Its low-energy consensus model also fits well with ESG investment mandates, adding further potential for future institutional alignment. Why This Coin Made it to This List: With real enterprise use cases and unmatched speed, Hedera fits right into the best altcoins for next bull run narrative. 7. Astra (Modular Web3 Ecosystem) Astra is making headlines with its modular architecture that allows projects to plug into various services, such as identity, DeFi rails, and smart contracts, without building from scratch. This plug-and-play design lowers the barrier for Web3 onboarding, particularly for small teams and startups. Q3 has shown consistent network upgrades, deeper SDK adoption, and new DeFi protocols launching on Astra. As the market seeks modular, scalable platforms to replace monolithic chains, Astra’s tech stack positions it well. Why This Coin Made it to This List: Modular architecture is gaining traction, and Astra’s efficiency makes it one of the best altcoins for next bull run. Conclusion: Final Picks for the Best Altcoins for Next Bull Run From Qubetics’ early breakout and advanced wallet features to Stacks’ smart contracts on Bitcoin and Immutable X’s scalable NFT rails, each of these eight altcoins shows serious potential. Qubetics alone combines fast ROI, no-KYC interoperability, and a strong Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) model, making it a standout. Meanwhile, Hedera and ASIA bring in enterprise-grade and decentralized AI innovation, respectively. For those looking to align themselves with technically sound projects, this is where the best altcoins for next bull run are already forming their base. Staying informed now could set up the right moves later.

2025-07-09T10:45:14,"Bitcoin (BTC) ready for takeoff as the dollar loses steam","BTC traders often track the DXY metric because of the correlation between the dollar’s dominance and Bitcoin’s pump and dump cycles. Right now, the DXY has sunk to a historically weak level, trading 6.5 points below its 200-day moving average, marking the largest deviation in the past 21 years. Meanwhile, U.S. debt has also reached new all-time highs. Both occurrences are concerning, but crypto enthusiasts may not feel too concerned about the falling DXY as it actually tends to benefit risk assets like Bitcoin. BTC bulls hope the falling DXY benefits Bitcoin as it has historically done. Source: CryptoQuant The dollar’s weakness historically gives BTC an edge When the dollar weakens , losing its safe-haven appeal, investors are forced to reassess their portfolio and allocate capital toward alternative asset classes like BTC. Historical data shows that periods like this, where the DXY showed great weakness, have been highly favorable to BTC. Good examples of times when this happened include 2021 and 2023, when there were significant DXY drops that coincided with BTC rallies. As it stands, analysts believe the market is setting up for the weakness of the DXY to potentially fuel a new BTC price rally. That opportunity is made even more enticing thanks to current monetary policy expectations including rate cuts, rising global M2 money supply and an increased demand for high-yield corporate bonds. The impact of the DXY’s weakness on BTC’s price has yet to reflect It is true the dollar is significantly weakened currently, but unlike in the past, its effect on Bitcoin’s price action seems subdued as the leading crypto is currently more than 2% lower than its all-time high of $111,814. This hesitation on Bitcoin’s end to behave as it would historically have during periods of dollar weakness can be linked to technical factors like the strong resistance level at the $110,000 – $112,000 range. Another potential reason is the sidelined liquidity. Yes, Bitcoin has finally secured a foothold in the corridors of power. However, many investors are still sidelined due to macroeconomic factors and analysts are convinced it contributes to BTC’s delayed response to the DXY’s weakness. Despite this, traders remain bullish on BTC’s potential. The DXY’s current significant deviation below its 200-day moving average is a powerful indicator of early bull phases for BTC, not just because of the technical triggers, but because it signals pending liquidity flow into the crypto markets. Overall activity on the Bitcoin network has also reduced and continues to do so as more investors go into HODL mode after previous rounds of profit taking. The institutional race to stockpile Bitcoin has also caused the percentage of coins left unmoved for over a year to increase from 61.7% to 63.61% by April 2025. If the DXY does not recover, it increases the potential of Bitcoin trending higher as retail investors who faded into the woodwork when institutions started buying heavily may emerge again.

2025-07-09T10:40:13,"Why Is Crypto Up Today? – July 9, 2025","The crypto market is up today. The majority of the top 100 coins per market cap have appreciated over the past 24 hours. At the same time, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has fallen 2.5% to $3.44 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $82.5 billion, one of the lowest levels we’ve seen over the past few days. TLDR: The crypto market turned upwards, with 95 of 100 coins going green; BTC is unchanged, trading at $108,322, while ETH saw the highest increase in the top 10 category; The prices and the sentiment continue moving sideways, awaiting further signals; The Dollar Index (DXY) has hit a historically weak, with BTC benefiting; US BTC and ETH ETFs continue positive, albeit minor flows; ETFs will continue to attract “significant investment from institutions and retail investors”; Investors are assessing the global trade and tariffs-related developments in the US. Crypto Winners & Losers In another shift from green to red and back to green, the prices of nearly all top 10 coins per market cap have appreciated today. Bitcoin (BTC) is up 0.4%, the same amount it had dropped this time yesterday, meaning it’s unchanged, currently trading at $108,812. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) appreciated by 3.1%, currently changing hands at $2,629. This is the highest increase in this category. The second-highest rise is XRP (XRP)’s 3% to the price of $2.33. Tron (TRX) is the only coin red coin, but its price is unchanged over the past day. It currently stands at $0.2869. Looking at the top 100 coins, we find that 95 of them are up at the time of writing. Two of these recorded double-digit increases. Cronos (CRO) and SPX6900 (SPX) are up 16.4% and 12.5% to $0.09335 and $1.4, respectively. On the other hand, Bonk (BONK) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) fell the most in this category. They’re down 6.3% and 2% to the prices of $0.0000218 and $1.06, respectively. The markets are largely waiting for additional signals, deciding where to move. Financial markets overall, but stocks more so than crypto, are keeping a close look on even the most minute developments in the US related to tariffs and trade. Meanwhile, South Korea has moved to reclassify crypto trading and brokerage firms as “venture companies.” This would provide these companies with access to government subsidies, tax incentives, and financial support. The Ministry of SMEs and Startups issued a notice on Monday and proposed an amendment to its startup law to include Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) in the venture company category.

The latter currently trades 6.5 points below its 200-day moving average. This is the largest deviation in the past 21 years, the analysts says. “Although this may appear alarming at first glance, it actually tends to benefit risk assets like Bitcoin,” they add. The dollar weakens and loses its safe-haven appeal, leading investors to “reassess their portfolio allocations and shift capital toward alternative asset classes.” Weak Dollar, Strong Bitcoin: A Time-Tested Correlation “This chart highlights periods where the DXY trades below its 365-day moving average. Looking at historical data, it becomes clear that such periods have been highly favorable to BTC.” – By @Darkfost_Coc pic.twitter.com/viwbcfNhdM — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) July 9, 2025 Moreover, Andrejs Balans, Risk Manager at YouHodler , commented on the impact of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the crypto market. “A big win for the crypto community came” when the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the first spot ETF. At first, the market responded with caution, with both BTC and ETH dipping slightly. However, many analysts expect the ETFs will continue to attract “significant investment from institutions and retail investors who want a straightforward way to participate in crypto without managing wallets or private keys,” Balans says. “The fund could help increase liquidity and reduce price swings over time by making crypto exposure more accessible.” ETF and Strategy Bitcoin purchases heatmap. We need more orange. pic.twitter.com/4uPsIIKfXY — Julio Moreno (@jjcmoreno) July 8, 2025 The SEC approving these ETFs signals that the regulator is “becoming more open to crypto investing as the market matures and better safeguards are established.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $108,812. Last day’s trading was quite choppy. However, the price did not go below the $108,000 level. The lowest it dropped to is $108,198. Also, the intraday high is $109,090. Investors are waiting to see if the coin will surpass and hold the $109,000 level. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Moreover, Ethereum is currently trading at $2,629. It started the day with the daily low of $2,456. At one point, it surged to $2,622, then to the current level as its intraday high. Over the next day, ETH may move above $2,635. Contrarily, it may fall below $2,500 should the market turn red abruptly. Also, the crypto market sentiment is largely unchanged. It has been moving between 49 and 55 over the week. The Fear and Greed Index is up from 50 and back to the level seen two days ago, standing at 52 today . Both the sentiment and the prices keep moving sideways, awaiting further signals.
