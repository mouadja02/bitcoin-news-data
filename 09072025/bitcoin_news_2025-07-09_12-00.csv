2025-07-09T09:57:39,"Bitcoin to $1 Million in Months? Samson Mow Reveals Shocking Scenario","The post Bitcoin to $1 Million in Months? Samson Mow Reveals Shocking Scenario appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with a positive update from Samson Mow, the vocal CEO of JAN3 and a Bitcoin advocate. He reveals a delightful prediction: Bitcoin could soar to $1 million per coin in a matter of weeks to months. In a recent interview , Mow outlined his concept of “hyperbitcoinization,” a transformative change in which Bitcoin emerges as a fundamental element of the global financial system. As fiat currencies jiggle and countries are coining forward to adopt crypto, Mow’s vision is enchanting both investors and skeptics. The $1 Million Bitcoin Scenario Explained Mow’s prediction relies on a sudden and steep increase, rather than a gradual rise. He describes the rise as a “brief and fierce surge” that might push Bitcoin’s worth to $1 million. “ They don’t gradually fail, they fail spectacularly “, Mow stated, citing fiat currencies, indicating the increasing global economic turmoil. With inflation reducing faith in traditional currency, Bitcoin’s decentralized features place it as a refuge, placing its worth at unmatched levels. Hyperbitcoinization: Governments Quietly Joining In Mow believes governments are already preparing for this shift. One example he gave is Bhutan, which has been mining Bitcoin since 2019. Today, its Bitcoin holdings are reportedly worth close to one trillion dollars – a signal, he says, that hyperbitcoinization is already underway. Violent upheaval is the most likely scenario. #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/Ibk5qtOVgi — Samson Mow (@Excellion) July 8, 2025 Countries with abundant energy resources are in a unique position, Mow explained. They can use their excess energy to mine Bitcoin, boost their reserves, and use the funds to pay down debt or support national projects. This, he believes, could help some nations stabilize their economies while shifting toward a Bitcoin-based financial model. Bitcoin Bonds Could Redefine Sovereign Debt Mow also sees a future where governments begin issuing Bitcoin-backed sovereign debt. This could lead to a new kind of global Bitcoin Bond market. He pointed to MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, whose company has used Bitcoin to raise funds successfully. That strategy, Mow said, could soon be adopted by countries. “It’s simply a matter of time before every country pulls that trigger,” Mow asserted. If that happens, Bitcoin’s demand and price could rise sharply, pushing it toward that $1 million mark. What’s Next for Bitcoin? With global uncertainty growing and more governments exploring Bitcoin, Mow’s vision of hyperbitcoinization may not be far off. If countries begin using Bitcoin to back their reserves or issue debt, the cryptocurrency could shift from being just an investment to becoming a core part of the global economy. Whether Bitcoin hits $1 million remains to be seen but the pieces, according to Mow, are already falling into place.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-to-1-million-in-months-samson-mow-reveals-shocking-scenario/,"BTC|FIAT|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING","News",cryptocompare

2025-07-09T09:50:14,"Digital Asset Oversight: Crucial Senate Hearing Set to Shape US Crypto Policy","BitcoinWorld Digital Asset Oversight: Crucial Senate Hearing Set to Shape US Crypto Policy The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation as a significant date approaches on the U.S. political calendar. A crucial Senate Hearing on Digital Asset Oversight has been scheduled, promising to be a pivotal moment for the future of the digital economy. This isn’t just another discussion; it’s an opportunity for stakeholders to voice their perspectives directly to policymakers, potentially laying the groundwork for clearer, more comprehensive Crypto Regulation in the United States. What’s on the Agenda for This Pivotal Senate Hearing? According to Eleanor Terrett, host of Crypto In America, the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition & Forestry has set July 15 for a hearing titled “Stakeholder Perspectives on Federal Oversight of Digital Commodities.” This title itself offers a glimpse into the committee’s focus: understanding how various parties view the regulation of digital assets that fall under the commodity classification. But why the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition & Forestry? It might seem counterintuitive at first glance. However, this committee oversees the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which has a primary role in regulating commodity markets, including derivatives. Many in the crypto space, particularly those dealing with assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, argue that these are commodities, not securities. Therefore, the CFTC, under the purview of this committee, is a key player in determining their regulatory fate. The hearing aims to gather insights from a broad spectrum of stakeholders. This means we can expect representatives from: Crypto Industry: Exchanges, developers, blockchain companies, and advocacy groups. Financial Institutions: Banks, investment firms, and traditional finance players exploring digital assets. Consumer Protection Advocates: Groups focused on safeguarding investors and users. Academic Experts: Researchers and legal scholars specializing in digital assets and financial technology. Government Agencies: Though not directly testifying, their perspectives will certainly influence the discussions. The outcome of such a Senate Hearing could significantly impact how Digital Commodities are traded, custodied, and integrated into the broader financial system. Why is Clear Crypto Regulation So Crucial for US Crypto Policy? The current regulatory landscape for digital assets in the U.S. is often described as a patchwork, leading to confusion and uncertainty. This fragmented approach has hindered innovation for some and left investors vulnerable in other instances. The primary debate often centers around whether a digital asset is a security (under the SEC’s purview) or a commodity (under the CFTC’s). This lack of clarity creates significant challenges: Regulatory Arbitrage: Businesses may seek jurisdictions with more favorable or less stringent rules. Investor Protection Gaps: Without clear rules, consumers might not be adequately protected from fraud or market manipulation. Innovation Stifled: Companies may hesitate to develop new products or services due to uncertain legal frameworks. Market Instability: Unregulated markets can be more volatile and prone to sudden shifts. A unified and comprehensive approach to Crypto Regulation is essential for fostering a healthy, secure, and innovative digital asset ecosystem. This hearing is a vital step towards addressing these complexities and shaping a coherent US Crypto Policy that balances growth with consumer safety. Understanding the Landscape of Digital Asset Oversight The concept of Digital Asset Oversight extends beyond just classifying assets. It involves a holistic approach to managing risks, promoting innovation, and ensuring market integrity. This includes aspects like: Licensing and Registration: Determining which entities need to register with which regulators. Custody Rules: How digital assets are securely stored and managed. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Know Your Customer (KYC): Preventing illicit financial activities. Market Surveillance: Monitoring for manipulation and ensuring fair trading practices. Taxation: Clarifying how digital asset transactions are taxed. Each of these areas presents its own set of challenges and requires careful consideration. The stakeholders presenting at the hearing will likely bring diverse perspectives on how best to implement effective Digital Asset Oversight without stifling the nascent industry’s potential. The goal is to build a regulatory framework that supports legitimate innovation while weeding out bad actors and protecting everyday users. What Does This Mean for the Future of Digital Commodities? The hearing’s specific focus on “ Digital Commodities ” signals a recognition of their distinct nature from traditional securities. This distinction is crucial because it determines which regulatory body has primary jurisdiction and what rules apply. If a clear framework for digital commodities emerges, it could: Boost Institutional Adoption: Clarity encourages more traditional financial institutions to enter the space. Enhance Market Liquidity: Increased participation can lead to deeper and more stable markets. Facilitate New Products: Clear rules enable the development of regulated derivatives, ETFs, and other financial products. Reduce Legal Uncertainty: Companies operating with digital commodities would have a clearer path for compliance. The outcome of this hearing, and subsequent legislative efforts, will significantly influence how assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum are treated within the U.S. financial system. It could pave the way for more robust, regulated markets for Digital Commodities , benefiting both investors and the broader economy. Actionable Insights for Navigating US Crypto Policy Changes For individuals and businesses involved in the digital asset space, staying informed about evolving US Crypto Policy is paramount. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow legislative developments, regulatory announcements, and industry news closely. Resources like official government websites, reputable crypto news outlets, and industry analyses are invaluable. Engage with Policymakers: If you’re a business or an active participant, consider supporting advocacy groups that represent your interests. Your voice, collectively, can influence policy direction. Prepare for Compliance: Assume that more regulation is coming. Businesses should start reviewing their operations to ensure they can adapt to new compliance requirements related to licensing, AML, and reporting. Understand Your Assets: Know whether the digital assets you hold or deal with are likely to be classified as securities or commodities, as this dictates their regulatory treatment. Seek Expert Advice: Consult with legal and financial professionals who specialize in digital assets to navigate complex regulatory landscapes. The path to comprehensive US Crypto Policy is a marathon, not a sprint. This hearing is a significant milestone, but the journey will require ongoing dialogue, collaboration, and adaptation from all sides. A Defining Moment for Digital Assets The upcoming U.S. Senate hearing on Digital Asset Oversight on July 15 is more than just a procedural event; it’s a defining moment for the digital asset industry. By gathering diverse stakeholder perspectives on Digital Commodities , the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition & Forestry is taking a critical step towards establishing a clearer, more predictable framework for Crypto Regulation . The discussions held and the insights gained from this Senate Hearing will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping future US Crypto Policy . While challenges remain, the commitment to open dialogue offers hope for a balanced regulatory environment that fosters innovation, protects consumers, and integrates digital assets into the mainstream financial system responsibly. The future of digital finance in the U.S. hangs in the balance, and this hearing is a testament to its growing importance.

2025-07-09T09:45:52,"Why are companies turning to Ethereum treasuries?","Several companies are placing bets on treasury strategies that involve Ethereum (ETH), as more institutions take up positions on the world’s second-largest crypto. ETH was trading up 2% on the day at $2,624 at the time of writing, having failed to break past the $2,600 resistance level late last week. Ethereum has gone up over 7% in the past week and is up 2.8% intraday. According to market analysts, even with institutional involvement, the asset is still trading within a tight range, locked in a sideways channel that has persisted for two months. Speaking on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin recently said corporate interest in Ethereum is climbing because they want to “tell the Ethereum story.” “What does Wall Street pay attention to? It pays attention to being able to make money,” he reckoned. GameSquare holdings commences $100 Million ETH treasury plan According to a July 8 press statement , GameSquare Holdings announced the launch of an ETH-based treasury strategy, against the backdrop of a partnership with crypto capital management firm Dialectic. The news took the company’s stock 0.57% upwards of its Tuesday closing session price, now changing hands at $1.54, according to Google Finance data . GameSquare’s Board has approved a total ETH allocation of up to $100 million, which will be deployed in stages while providing liquidity for ongoing operations. The ETH-focused treasury is built on Dialectic’s proprietary Medici platform, which integrates machine learning, automated optimization, and risk management systems. GameSquare is targeting annual yields of 8-14%, well above the current staking benchmarks of 3-4%. To help fund the Ether acquisitions, GameSquare launched a public offering of over 8.4 million shares at $0.95 per share to raise approximately $8 million. The offering was filed under a registration statement declared effective by the SEC on June 4 and is expected to close by July 9. SharpLink acquires over $533 million in ETH Another Media and Sports betting technology company, SharpLink Gaming, disclosed on Tuesday that it now holds 205,634 ETH, valued at more than $533 million, bought between June 28 and July 4. NEW: SharpLink now holds ~205,634 ETH Between June 28 and July 4, SharpLink acquired ~7,689 ETH for ~$19.2M at an average price of ~$2,501 per ETH During that same period, the company raised an additional ~$64.2M through its ATM facility, selling ~5.4M shares SharpLink has… pic.twitter.com/bhS0K1ZBul — SBET (SharpLink Gaming) (@SharpLinkGaming) July 8, 2025 During that period, SharpLink purchased 7,689 ETH for over $19 million at an average price of $2,501 per token. As reported by Cryptopolitan, SharpLink’s stock rallied 7% after announcing a $30 million Ether purchase on June 25, bringing its holdings to 188,000 ETH. The company has committed all of its Ether holdings to staking and restaking protocols, earning 322 ETH in rewards, worth roughly $848,750, since June 2. SharpLink raised $64 million in net proceeds to fund the ETH investments, by selling more than 5.4 million shares. In May, it filed plans to sell up to $1 billion in common stock, with the bulk of the proceeds earmarked for more ETH acquisitions. Lubin, who is SharpLink’s chairman, said the strategy is rooted in financial discipline and transparency. “Our sustained success is a direct result of SharpLink’s disciplined execution of its ETH-centric treasury management strategy,” he remarked. Lubin explained that adding ETH to corporate treasuries helps to reduce excess Ether supply and could eventually create positive price pressure. Bit Digital goes all-in on Ethereum Meanwhile, earlier this week, Nasdaq-listed Bit Digital has completely exited its Bitcoin holdings in favor of Ethereum. The company sold all of its BTC assets, raising $172 million in the process, and used the funds to acquire more than 100,000 ETH. After buying Ethereum, Bit Digital is reportedly one of the largest corporate Ethereum treasury firms globally. “We believe Ethereum has the ability to rewrite the entire financial system.” CEO Sam Tabar told reporters earlier this week. “We are starting with exposure to over 100K ETH for now, but we intend to aggressively add more so we become the preeminent ETH holding company in the world.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/why-are-companies-moving-towards-ethereum/,"ETH|REGULATION|TRADING|BUSINESS|BTC","Ethereum|Bit Digital|ETH|GameSquare|SEC|Sharplink Gaming|USD",cryptocompare

2025-07-09T09:35:25,"Remixpoint’s Bold Move: Japanese Energy Firm Secures $215M for Massive Bitcoin Acquisition","BitcoinWorld Remixpoint’s Bold Move: Japanese Energy Firm Secures $215M for Massive Bitcoin Acquisition In a fascinating development that underscores the growing intersection of traditional industries and the digital asset world, Japanese energy consulting firm Remixpoint has made headlines with a significant announcement. The company, known for its ventures in energy, used car sales, and even virtual currency exchange, recently declared via X (formerly Twitter) that it has successfully raised an impressive ¥31.5 billion, equivalent to approximately $215 million. But what makes this news truly captivating is the intended use of these substantial funds: a strategic and ambitious Bitcoin acquisition . Why is Remixpoint Acquiring Bitcoin ? A Deep Dive into Their Strategy Remixpoint’s decision to allocate such a substantial sum towards Bitcoin is a clear indicator of a shifting paradigm in corporate finance. The firm aims to expand its current BTC holdings from 1,051 BTC to a staggering 3,000 BTC. This isn’t just a casual investment; it represents a deliberate and strategic pivot for a company rooted in energy consulting. So, why Bitcoin, and why now? Inflation Hedge: In an era of economic uncertainty and fluctuating fiat currencies, many companies view Bitcoin as a robust hedge against inflation. Its decentralized nature and fixed supply make it an attractive alternative to traditional assets susceptible to monetary policy changes. Store of Value: Bitcoin has increasingly been recognized as ‘digital gold’—a reliable store of value that can preserve purchasing power over time. For Remixpoint, this could be a long-term treasury management strategy. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin to a corporate treasury can help diversify risk and potentially enhance overall portfolio returns, especially given the volatility of energy markets. Future-Proofing: As the global economy continues to digitalize, embracing cryptocurrencies can position a company at the forefront of financial innovation, potentially attracting new investors and talent. This move by Remixpoint isn’t isolated. It follows a trend set by other forward-thinking corporations like MicroStrategy, which has aggressively accumulated Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset. This growing interest from established firms lends further credibility and stability to the cryptocurrency market. Understanding the Broader Corporate Bitcoin Strategy Trend Remixpoint’s move highlights a significant trend: the increasing adoption of Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset. This isn’t just about speculation; it’s about a fundamental shift in how companies perceive and manage their balance sheets. Several factors contribute to this evolving corporate Bitcoin strategy : Benefits for Corporations: Potential for Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has historically offered significant returns, potentially boosting a company’s asset base. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin offers a borderless, permissionless financial system, which can be advantageous for international operations. Transparency and Security: The blockchain’s transparent ledger and robust cryptographic security offer unique advantages over traditional financial systems, reducing counterparty risk. Challenges and Considerations: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price swings can be dramatic, posing risks to corporate balance sheets if not managed carefully. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, which can create compliance challenges. Security Risks: Storing significant amounts of Bitcoin requires sophisticated security measures to prevent hacks and theft. Companies embarking on this path often engage specialized custody solutions and robust risk management frameworks to mitigate these challenges. Remixpoint’s substantial raise suggests a well-thought-out plan rather than a hasty decision. Implications for the Japanese Energy Firm and Beyond As a prominent Japanese energy firm , Remixpoint’s foray into large-scale Bitcoin acquisition sends a strong signal to both the traditional finance sector and the cryptocurrency market in Japan and globally. Japan has historically been a significant player in the crypto space, with early adoption and a relatively progressive regulatory stance. This move by Remixpoint could: Inspire Others: Encourage other Japanese corporations, particularly those in tech and energy, to explore similar treasury strategies. Boost Local Crypto Market: Increase liquidity and demand within the Japanese cryptocurrency ecosystem. Enhance Bitcoin’s Legitimacy: Further solidify Bitcoin’s status as a legitimate asset class for institutional investors and corporations worldwide. The energy sector, in particular, has an interesting relationship with Bitcoin, given the energy consumption associated with mining. However, as more mining operations shift towards renewable energy sources, and as companies like Remixpoint integrate digital assets into their core business, the synergy between energy and crypto could become increasingly positive and innovative. Navigating the Future of BTC Holdings : Risks and Opportunities For Remixpoint, managing its expanded BTC holdings will be crucial. While the potential for upside is significant, so are the inherent risks of cryptocurrency markets. Effective management will involve: Custody Solutions: Utilizing secure, institutional-grade custody providers to protect the assets. Risk Management: Implementing clear policies for managing price volatility, potentially through hedging strategies or by maintaining a long-term outlook. Regulatory Compliance: Staying abreast of evolving regulations in Japan and international markets to ensure full compliance. This strategic investment by Remixpoint also opens up possibilities for future innovations. Could we see more energy firms exploring blockchain technology for energy trading, supply chain management, or even tokenized energy assets? The possibilities are vast, and Remixpoint’s bold move positions them as a potential pioneer in this evolving landscape. The Bigger Picture: What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Acquisition on a Global Scale? Remixpoint’s substantial Bitcoin acquisition is more than just a company-specific event; it’s a testament to the growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a viable asset. As more corporations, large and small, consider or execute similar strategies, the overall market capitalization and stability of Bitcoin could see significant long-term benefits. This trend signifies a maturation of the cryptocurrency market, moving beyond retail speculation to serious institutional adoption. For individual investors and market observers, Remixpoint’s action serves as a strong signal. It suggests that despite market fluctuations, the underlying value proposition of Bitcoin as a decentralized, scarce, and globally accessible asset continues to resonate with sophisticated corporate treasuries looking for alternative ways to manage capital and drive future growth. Conclusion: A New Era of Corporate Finance Remixpoint’s decision to raise $215 million for a substantial Bitcoin acquisition marks a pivotal moment, not just for the company, but for the broader corporate adoption of digital assets. It highlights a strategic vision that looks beyond traditional financial instruments, embracing Bitcoin as a core component of future growth and treasury management. As more companies follow suit, we are likely to witness a profound transformation in corporate finance, where digital assets play an increasingly central role. This move by a Japanese energy consulting firm underscores Bitcoin’s growing legitimacy and its undeniable place in the global financial landscape.

2025-07-09T09:31:42,"Best Crypto to Buy Now As Bitcoin ETF Inflows Skyrocket Again","Bitcoin ETF inflows have surged once more, and the effect on the crypto market has been immediate. In the past month alone, over 50,000 BTC has poured into institutional products, marking a clear return of appetite from funds that had previously stepped back. This resurgence has reignited speculative interest, pulling the market out of its post-correction slump. Sentiment, which had hovered near neutral for weeks, has quickly turned bullish again. With liquidity returning and risk appetite building, market structure looks ready to shift into a more aggressive phase. Bitcoin Dominance Slips as Altcoins Eye Breakout Territory While ETF inflows continue to support Bitcoin’s trajectory, a more nuanced trend is playing out beneath the surface. Bitcoin dominance, which refers to the percentage of total market capitalization held by Bitcoin, has faced multiple rejections at the 65 percent level and is now in retreat once again. This metric is often overlooked during bullish periods, but historically, its decline has been a strong precursor to altcoin rallies. When dominance falls, it signals that capital is rotating out of Bitcoin and into smaller-cap assets, often in search of higher returns as market confidence grows. That environment appears to be forming now. With Ecoinometrics projecting a potential Bitcoin price target of 117,000 dollars based on ETF inflow momentum, the overarching sentiment remains bullish. Yet as more traders begin to position themselves ahead of that move, the appetite for altcoins is naturally picking up. Bitcoin ETF flows are lining up behind a breakout.With rolling 30-day inflows nearing 50K BTC and rising, you’d expect more upside for Bitcoin’s price.Our ETF flow-to-price model suggests an expected target of $117,000. pic.twitter.com/d2NW3yZYRM — ecoinometrics (@ecoinometrics) July 6, 2025 Dominance breakouts typically require multiple attempts before giving way, but the current chart structure suggests weakening support. If Bitcoin dominance drops below key levels in the coming days, the market could quickly pivot into what many consider the early phase of altseason. Altcoin activity has already shown early signs of life across several segments, from mid-cap infrastructure plays to smaller ecosystem tokens. Volume is returning. New narratives are being tested. And perhaps most importantly, traders are starting to shift away from defensive positions. In that context, a breakdown in dominance may act less as a warning sign and more as a green light. If it plays out, the broader crypto market could be in for a strong leg up. Best Crypto to Buy Now – Altcoins With High Growth Potential and Low Price Tags Bitcoin Hyper Not all Layer 2s are built to echo the architecture of their base chain. Bitcoin Hyper leans into the idea that Bitcoin’s strength lies not only in its scarcity but also in the consistency of its economic rhythm. While most Layer 2s chase modularity or scaling throughput, Bitcoin Hyper focuses on how network activity can sync with market psychology. Its design does not simply add speed or reduce costs. It translates Bitcoin’s value language into something developers and token ecosystems can build on. The reason this matters now is because capital is looking to spread out again. The ETF narrative has created gravitational pull around Bitcoin, but it has also opened the door for infrastructure built around it. Bitcoin Hyper exists exactly in that space. It inherits security assumptions from Bitcoin without diluting them, and more importantly, it enables value and interaction layers to emerge without altering the base chain. The project has already received praise from top crypto content creators like ClayBro , who have noted its utility and potential adoptability through posts or videos on platforms such as YouTube. There is also a clarity in its roadmap that helps distinguish it from the rest. Rather than promising ambiguous integrations or questionable partnerships, Bitcoin Hyper focuses on one mission: making Bitcoin programmable without friction. In a time when traders are watching dominance metrics closely and waiting for altcoin momentum, Bitcoin Hyper represents a rare project that aligns with both conviction and timing. It is not trying to ride Bitcoin’s coattails. It is trying to be the rails for what comes next. Snorter The crypto market has always been a breeding ground for experimentation, but few projects lean into that reality as deliberately as Snorter . It is a Telegram-native bot that runs on AI logic, turning real-time chat activity into an actionable layer for trading and research. That may sound technical, but its utility is straightforward: it is a plug-and-play engine for information efficiency inside Telegram, a platform already central to crypto community activity. What makes Snorter feel unusually well-timed is how it intersects with a broader market that is starting to move again. As ETFs bring capital back into the space, information speed becomes more valuable. Being first to a narrative, first to volume, or even first to sudden token movement can be the difference between 20 percent upside and 200 percent. Snorter enables this through microsecond-level alerts, AI-generated call summaries, whale transaction monitors, and sentiment sweeps, all within the app that people are already using. There is also something deeper happening. As altcoins start to heat up again, the ability to analyze token-specific momentum without flipping between ten different dashboards is not just convenient, it is competitive. Snorter strips away noise and makes opportunity feel visible. In a sense, Snorter feels like a response to how cluttered and fragmented crypto has become. Instead of building another analytics terminal, it embeds intelligence directly into the places traders already live. For a cycle that is beginning to demand more agility, that is exactly where utility belongs. SUBBD SUBBD is not trying to reinvent the creator economy. It is attempting to repair it. This is a platform where content creators; not advertisers, not platforms or algorithms are the actual axis of value. At a glance, it may look like just another decentralized content network, but its mechanics suggest otherwise. On SUBBD, influence is not farmed. It is staked, backed, and sustained by a model where creators are partners in protocol growth, not just passengers. The relevance of SUBBD in this current market climate is not abstract. With ETF-driven inflows reshaping investor confidence, crypto users are beginning to look beyond coins and into ecosystems. SUBBD offers one of the few clear examples where user-generated value becomes protocol-level currency. The more creators produce, the more the protocol expands. That is not a metaphor. It is how the system is designed. There is also real traction being built. Creator DAOs are starting to form, allowing groups of influencers or educators to launch tokenized portfolios based on collective visibility. These are not performance gimmicks. They are functional economies. As attention begins to drift away from the majors and into altcoin stories, platforms like SUBBD become more than just use cases. They become reflections of what this cycle could reward not just fast money, but durable networks with real participant loops. It is one thing to watch crypto markets rise. It is another to watch communities rise alongside them. SUBBD, quietly and precisely, is built for that purpose. Best Wallet Token Some wallets exist purely as storage. Best Wallet is the opposite. It functions as a digital command center not just holding assets but shaping how users interact with the broader Web3 universe. The Best Wallet Token powers that ecosystem, threading through layers of access, rewards, governance, and embedded functionality. What makes this more than just another tokenized app is how deliberately it has been built. Rather than overextending into buzzwords, Best Wallet focuses on core principles: speed, clarity, and control. It compresses the chaos of DeFi, NFTs, token swaps, and staking into a format that actually feels navigable. The interface is clean. The UX choices are intentional. And the token is not just ornamental; it is embedded into the platform’s DNA. With ETF inflows signaling a new wave of institutional validation, a rising number of everyday users are re-entering the market. These are not developers or deep technical users. They are people who need intuitive gateways that do not compromise on power. Best Wallet fits that moment with precision. 🔥 Over $13M Raised and Counting! 🔥Best Wallet is becoming the go-to for traders who want speed, simplicity, and early access to what matters:✅ Buy new tokens early, directly in-app✅ Buy and bridge across chains in one place✅ Full portfolio control, no clutterDownload… pic.twitter.com/0SDNVPov6v — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) June 4, 2025 Having raised over 13 million dollars already, what further sets it apart is the modular utility of the token. It is used for fee discounts, early feature access, community decision-making, and vault participation. In a market where tools often feel either overbuilt or underpowered, Best Wallet strikes a rare middle ground. As altcoin appetite builds, infrastructure tokens that enable onboarding, simplify interaction, and reward usage will likely be first in line. Best Wallet Token has positioned itself to be one of those access points; not merely as a layer, but as the welcome mat to the ecosystem itself. Conclusion With Bitcoin ETF momentum rekindling market optimism, crypto appears to be entering a new expansionary phase. Altcoin sentiment is strengthening, dominance is faltering, and capital is beginning to rotate outward in search of growth. The projects highlighted above each align with this shift in different but complementary ways ranging from infrastructure to innovation, and from utility to accessibility. These are not just tokens riding a trend. They are active participants in reshaping how value is stored, shared, and scaled across the crypto space. In a market preparing for its next leg up, these may very well be the kinds of assets worth watching closely. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

The project is priced at $0.03 in the 5th presale phase, which is more than 60% sold. Those who invest in this phase will get a 100% return on investment after listing the token. More than $11.9 million has already been raised, with a total of more than 12,900 early investors. During presale Phase 6, the token will cost $0.035, and that represents 16.67% return on whatever investment was incurred during Phase 5. Mutuum Finance could hit $1 post launch. Bitcoin’s Steady Climb Signals Where Smart Money Is Moving Bitcoin (BTC) trades around $108,200 at the moment, as institutional investors observed a subdued but eloquent accumulation stage. Within three months, spot Bitcoin ETFs have quietly received over $14 billion, causing the level of control by institutions nearly to 25 percent of circulating supply. And this is not a price shift, it is a positioning shift. With the BTC stabilizing in the $107K to $110K area, there is an apparent growth of large funds gaining exposure to the cryptocurrency in anticipation of a possible Q3 breakout as the next macro leg higher. Against this background, it is not a shock that investors are thinking of diversifying out of BTC into high upside investments such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as part of a multi-prong summer approach. Over 12,900 Investors Join Mutuum Finance Presale The Mutuum Finance presale has more than 12,900 investors and has raised more than $11.9 million. Investors have picked up more than 60% of the tokens in phase 5. This indicates growing confidence of investors in the short-term success of the project as well as in their bright future. Mutuum Finance Is Changing the Game in DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is transforming DeFi lending through the creation of a platform that renders customers the sole owner of their assets.

In the P2C, a pool of lends is controlled by smart contracts. The platform is sensitive to prevailing market conditions in real time, an aspect that makes returns to lenders less volatile and borrowers financially stable. Through the elimination of intermediaries, the P2P model provides direct lending, which is particularly convenient on highly volatile assets like meme coins due to the fact that. Mutuum Finance Giveaway to Early Backers Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering $100,000 giveaway , divided into 10 winners of 10,000 MUTM tokens.

As the users level up they will be rewarded the bonus tokens. While institutional capital continues to pour into Bitcoin, with over $14 billion in ETF inflows and nearly 25% of BTC’s supply now institutionally held, savvy investors are also turning their sights toward high-upside alternatives like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With over $11.9 million raised, 12,900+ investors, and Phase 5 already 60% sold out, MUTM is quickly establishing itself as one of the top DeFi crypto tokens of 2025.

2025-07-09T09:20:11,"Bitcoin eyes gains as dollar index sinks to 21-year lows — Can BTC surge past all-time high?","A weakening U.S. dollar is opening the door for a possible new surge in Bitcoin, stirring questions about whether one of finance’s most familiar patterns is about to play out again. That’s the view in a July 9 analysis shared by CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost, who points out that the U.S. Dollar Index has dropped to a historically weak level. It’s now sitting 6.5 points under its 200-day moving average, the largest gap seen in more than 21 years. Some traditional markets may be concerned about this, but history shows that a declining dollar often creates an environment that is favorable for risky assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ). As traders move their money to assets that might hold value better during currency stress, Bitcoin has frequently increased in value. For instance, when the DXY surged to a 20-year high of 114 in 2022, Bitcoin fell to roughly $16,000, but it bounced back above $40,000 when the dollar fell in late 2023. This trend has repeatedly occurred since 2015, with Bitcoin’s correlation to the dollar index typically ranging from -0.4 to -0.8. You might also like: Bitcoin is deep into its bull run, here’s what comes next: analyst Despite this backdrop, Bitcoin’s price hasn’t broken out just yet. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $108,712, a small increase of 0.2% in the past 24 hours. It’s still only about 2.7% below its all-time high of $111,814 set on May 22. With volume dropping 18% in a single day to about $21.5 billion, trading activity has cooled off. The derivatives markets have also seen a slowdown in activity, as per data from Coinglass. Open interest has dipped slightly to $73.41 billion, while derivatives trading volume has decreased by roughly 12% to $55.3 billion. This implies that despite the dollar’s decline, traders are still being cautious for the time being. On the technical side, Bitcoin’s signals are mixed. The market is neither significantly overbought nor oversold, according to the relative strength index, which is neutral at 56. Although the momentum indicator itself has entered negative territory, suggesting short-term hesitation, the MACD has turned positive, indicating some upward momentum is building. Bitcoin price analysis. Credit: crypto.news Bitcoin is currently trading above all of its major moving averages, which typically denotes an overall upward trend and implies that any declines may quickly find support. A slight widening of the Bollinger Bands suggests that price volatility may increase soon. Traders are keeping an eye on whether Bitcoin can break through resistance at $110,300 or if it will drop below support at $107,100. For the time being, the declining dollar creates favorable conditions for a possible Bitcoin rally. However, the speed at which traders take action may determine whether history repeats itself.

According to a July 8 press release , the entertainment and technology company has launched an Ethereum ( ETH ) treasury strategy. The company kicked off the move with an $8 million underwritten public offering, with most of the capital set to flow directly into Ethereum yield opportunities. For the long term, GameSquare’s board has approved up to $100 million in ETH allocations, to be deployed gradually while preserving enough liquidity to fund its operations. The firm has also partnered with Swiss crypto investment firm Dialectic to generate returns on its holdings, using Medici, an automated Ethereum-native yield platform. You might also like: SharpLink strengthens ETH bet with additional $30.6M purchase Commenting on the move, GameSquare CEO Justin Kenna said the shift aligns with the company’s footprint in gaming, technology, and media, and reflects growing institutional adoption of digital assets. He added that the new treasury strategy will enhance financial flexibility and support a capital plan that is focused on continued ETH accumulation. GameSquare’s adoption comes as more public companies turn to Ethereum for long-term reserves. Another Nasdaq-listed firm, Bit Digital, recently disclosed it had gone all-in on Ether, selling off its entire Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings to expand its ETH position. Similarly, SharpLink Gaming has been on an aggressive accumulation streak , building out its own Ethereum treasury reserve. The firm is now the world’s second-largest ETH holder, behind only the Ethereum Foundation. Following its announcement, GameSquare’s stock jumped roughly 60%, reflecting strong investor support for the shift. Meanwhile, the increased adoption is translating into price action for ETH. The asset trades around $2,625 at the time of writing, up 2.8% in the past 24 hours and nearly 7% on the week. While gains remain modest, current prices mark a decent recovery after several weeks of underperformance.

H100 Group AB, a Swedish health technology company focusing on longevity and AI-driven health services, has successfully closed two key funding rounds, raising around SEK 516 million (~$54M). The capital raise was done via a directed share issue (Tranche 6, issuing 27.17 million shares at SEK 6.38) and a directed convertible debenture issue (Tranche 7, SEK 342.3 million, conversion price SEK 8.48). The directed share issue diluted existing shareholders by about 10.1%, and if all convertible debentures from Tranche 7 are converted, it could cause an additional dilution of around 14.3%. Investors from these tranches also have rights to participate in a future Tranche 8, which will be another convertible debenture issuance with a conversion price set 33% higher than Tranche 7. The funds will support H100 Group’s Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, aimed at preserving capital and strengthening the balance sheet by investing in Bitcoin ( BTC ).

That deal built on an earlier raise in May , where H100 brought in SEK 21 million ($2.2 million) through 0% interest convertible loans—also led by Back, alongside other investors such as Morten Klein and Crafoord Capital Partners. Including all previous raises, total capital secured to date amounts to SEK 921 million (approximately $96 million).

In a new interview on CNBC, the Wall Street investor says the heavy demand for US treasuries from across the globe suggests there’s no cause for worry over the deficit. “There’s a great slogan that I think really applies to politics and international affairs, which is when someone tells you who they are, believe them. But in the market, when someone tells you who they are, don’t believe them [until when] they actually do something with their money. So all the people who are pontificating about this… The price of this risk is a 10-year Treasury yield. And what’s happened to the 10-year Treasury yield? It’s been directionless since December of 2022. So the more important question is given that all these people are pontificating about it, why hasn’t it moved? And again, I think the reason is there’s no alternative to Treasuries. If there was a real alternative to Treasuries, then all of this stuff about the deficit is something that I would pay attention to. But as long as there’s no alternative, there’s nothing to talk about.” Eisman also says the demand for US bonds all over the world is “insatiable” and that he believes investors will always show up in Treasury auctions to accumulate government debt. Late last month, Eisman said he was optimistic about the stock market due to the long-term growth potential of the US economy. “We’ve been in a bull market pretty much for the last 10 years with some fits and starts. And so buy the dip has become almost a religion. It’s a religion that right now I largely subscribe to because I am of the view… that the US economy is more dynamic than it’s ever been in my lifetime.

2025-07-09T09:10:37,"New Zealand bans Crypto ATMs and limit international cash transfers","As part of new anti-money laundering policy changes, New Zealand declares a ban on cryptocurrency ATMs. Nicole McKee, the associate justice minister, announced more stringent enforcement actions aimed at financial crime. The goal of the government is to stop criminals from turning cash into cryptocurrency assets. Current global data shows 38,537 crypto ATMs operating across 67 countries worldwide. New Zealand targets crypto ATM operations under AML reforms As part of extensive anti-money laundering efforts, New Zealand intends to outlaw cryptocurrency ATMs. Nicole McKee, an associate justice minister, announced the ban on illegal cash conversion. The ban aims to prevent criminals from converting physical cash into cryptocurrencies. Cabinet agreed to introduce legislation strengthening enforcement powers for police and regulators. The new bill focuses on cracking down on money laundering operations across financial sectors. A new financial sanctions supervisory regime will be established under the reforms. The government will set a $5,000 upper limit on international cash transfers per transaction. This restriction reduces criminal organizations’ ability to move funds offshore through cash channels. The limit applies to all international money transfer services operating in New Zealand. Current global data shows 38,537 crypto ATMs operate worldwide across 67 countries. Other services number 235,581 locations with 41 producers and 349 operators managing the network. New Zealand’s ban contrasts with the global expansion of crypto ATM infrastructure. The ability to request information from banks will be expanded for the Financial Intelligence Unit. Businesses subject to AML/CFT Act must provide ongoing data on persons of interest. The FIU can also request contextual information from other businesses regarding financial activities. These measures target criminals while maintaining focus on legitimate business operations without excessive compliance burdens. Government balances crime prevention with business efficiency The New Zealand government aims to create one of the easiest places for legitimate business operations. For lower-risk clients, Minister McKee described intentions to eliminate the need for address verification. Due diligence requirements for lower-risk trusts will also face relaxation under new policies. There are now two amendment measures in Parliament that will relieve businesses of onerous compliance obligations. The legislation delivers practical relief by the end of 2025 for affected sectors. Businesses can focus resources on actual risks rather than low-risk client paperwork. Since 2019, the global financial and regulatory landscape has shifted across multiple jurisdictions. New Zealand seeks a smarter and more agile AML/CFT system targeting criminal activities. The approach balances criminal prevention with efficient business operations for competitive advantage. Cryptocurrencies lack direct regulation as financial products in New Zealand. The government increased oversight through broader fintech and anti-money laundering legislation instead. Digital assets receive recognition as property for tax purposes rather than legal tender. The Taxation Act 2025 implements the OECD Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework requirements. Crypto asset service providers must report transaction data to Inland Revenue Department. Full implementation begins April 2026 with preparation and compliance underway during 2025. In order to guide the formulation of a new national strategy, targeted engagement with industry stakeholders will soon commence. The levy framework will also undergo consultation processes with affected business sectors. Global crypto ATM infrastructure shows widespread adoption patterns Worldwide crypto ATM data indicate 38,537 units deployed across 67 world countries. The network has 235,581 additional services enabling cash for cryptocurrency trading. 41 firms produce crypto ATM hardware with 349 operators managing deployments. The international infrastructure enables others to sell or purchase Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Cash-based transactions are suitable for individuals who do not have conventional banking relationships. Crypto ATMs connect the physical cash and digital asset worlds with automated transactions. Source: Coin ATM Radar New Zealand’s planned prohibition is contrary to global growth of crypto ATM networks. The majority of countries view the machines as legitimate parts of financial services infrastructure. The machines offer regulated entry points for cryptocurrency adoption in many jurisdictions. Crypto ATM companies have to comply with local anti-money laundering laws in the majority of markets. Transaction limits and identity verification procedures differ country by country and regulatory climate. In some places, full KYC is mandated, but others allow lower transactions anonymously. The New Zealand ban targets potential money laundering threats in cash-to-crypto transactions. Government officials are worried about criminals laundering illicit cash using ATMs to turn it into digital money. The ban aims to plug loopholes in the financial surveillance system.

2025-07-09T09:08:20,"Anthony Pompliano’s ProCap Appears Better Than Peers Based on the BTC HODLer's Own Data","Anthony Pompliano's ProCap , recently shared an update on its progress and valuation metrics. ProCap has entered into a $1 billion business combination agreement with Columbus Circle Capital Corp 1 (CCCM). As part of the deal, ProCap has raised over $750 million and already deployed more than $500 million to purchase bitcoin (BTC), amassing a treasury of 4,950 BTC. This makes ProCap, the 13th largest public holder of bitcoin globally. The data and analysis presented by Pompliano comes directly from ProCap and refer to implied multiple Net Asset Value (mNAV) premiums. According to ProCap’s analysis, the company’s stock is currently trading at the lowest implied mNAV premium among a group of bitcoin treasury companies, at 1.3x, compared to peers like Cantor Equity Partners (CEP) at 2.2x. This low mNAV multiple suggests ProCap BTC LLC could be undervalued relative to other bitcoin treasury firms. A significant feature of the proposed business combination is the redemption right for CCCM shareholders. Investors who hold CCCM stock as of the record date for the special meeting to approve the business combination will have the right to redeem their shares for the cash held in trust. As of the closing of CCCM’s initial public offering in May, this pro rata trust value is anticipated to be about $10 per share. The maximum loss for investors is approximately 55 cents per share if the trust value holds at around $10 according to Pompliano. However, if ProCap implied mNAV premium rises to match that of Cantor Equity Partners (2.2x), the post-deal stock price could reach about $17.82 per share.

2025-07-09T09:00:52,"Mt. Gox Stolen BTC Under Alarming Attack: Billions Targeted by Hackers","BitcoinWorld Mt. Gox Stolen BTC Under Alarming Attack: Billions Targeted by Hackers The cryptocurrency world is once again on high alert as alarming reports surface about sophisticated hacking attempts targeting one of the most infamous caches of digital wealth: the Mt. Gox stolen BTC . This isn’t just about a few misplaced tokens; we’re talking about billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin that hackers are desperately trying to seize from an old, critical address. The sheer scale of this threat underscores the persistent vulnerabilities in the digital asset landscape and serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing battle against cybercriminals. The Alarming Threat to Mt. Gox Stolen BTC Imagine a treasure chest holding over $8 billion in digital gold, lying dormant but under constant surveillance by malicious actors. This is precisely the situation with the Bitcoin (BTC) address associated with the defunct Mt. Gox exchange. According to a recent research report by BitMEX, cited by Decrypt, hackers are actively targeting this specific address, attempting to gain unauthorized access to its vast reserves. The Mt. Gox stolen BTC saga is a notorious chapter in crypto history, and the continued attempts to exploit its remnants highlight the long memory and persistent nature of cybercriminals in the blockchain space. These aren’t random attacks; they are calculated, well-researched efforts aimed at a colossal payout. The original theft from Mt. Gox, which occurred nearly a decade ago, remains one of the largest cryptocurrency heists ever recorded. While efforts have been ongoing to reimburse creditors, the bulk of the stolen funds have largely remained untouched, held in addresses that are now under intense scrutiny. The current targeting of these addresses signifies a new phase of this long-running drama, bringing fresh concerns about the security of large, dormant cryptocurrency holdings. This development serves as a critical warning for anyone holding significant amounts of crypto in older, less frequently accessed wallets. Unpacking the Bitcoin Address Hack Mechanics How exactly are these sophisticated attackers attempting to breach such a heavily scrutinized target? BitMEX’s report sheds light on their primary tactic: highly deceptive phishing. The attackers sent a phishing link directly to the target Bitcoin address , cleverly disguised as the official website of Salomon Brothers. For those unfamiliar, Salomon Brothers was a prominent, albeit now defunct, Wall Street investment bank. This choice of disguise is particularly cunning, aiming to lend an air of legitimacy and financial gravitas to the fraudulent scheme. It’s a clear indication that these attackers are not only technically adept but also possess a deep understanding of social engineering and historical financial contexts. The mechanics of such a phishing attack typically involve tricking the recipient into revealing sensitive information, such as private keys, seed phrases, or login credentials, by clicking on a malicious link. While a direct attack on a cold storage address is complex, the goal might be to exploit any potential vulnerability in the associated infrastructure or to trick individuals with access to these funds. BitMEX also noted that these exploiters have broadened their scope, targeting multiple addresses created as far back as 2011. This suggests a systematic approach to identifying and attempting to compromise old, high-value Bitcoin wallets, likely belonging to early adopters or entities that accumulated significant BTC in the early days of the network. The sophistication of these methods underscores the need for extreme vigilance, especially for entities or individuals managing large, historical crypto holdings. The attackers are patient and innovative, constantly evolving their tactics to bypass existing security measures. BitMEX Research Uncovers Sophisticated Phishing Attacks Crypto The detailed insights into these malicious activities come courtesy of a recent research report from BitMEX, a leading cryptocurrency derivatives exchange. Their proactive investigation into these threats provides invaluable intelligence for the wider crypto community. BitMEX’s findings confirm that these aren’t isolated incidents but part of a coordinated campaign leveraging advanced social engineering techniques. The use of a seemingly legitimate, historical financial institution like Salomon Brothers as a front for these phishing attacks crypto highlights a new level of cunning in the cybercriminal playbook. BitMEX’s analysis likely involved monitoring suspicious network activity, analyzing on-chain transactions, and tracing the origins of these malicious links. Their report serves as a crucial warning, not just to the direct targets but to anyone involved in the cryptocurrency space. It emphasizes that even addresses holding funds for over a decade are not immune to determined attackers. The report’s implications extend beyond the Mt. Gox case, suggesting that any large, publicly known Bitcoin address could potentially become a target for similar highly tailored phishing or social engineering attacks. The continuous monitoring and reporting by entities like BitMEX are vital for maintaining the overall security posture of the decentralized ecosystem. By exposing these sophisticated tactics, they empower users and institutions to better protect their assets and stay one step ahead of evolving threats. Understanding Broader Crypto Security Threats The Mt. Gox incident, while specific, is a stark reminder of the broader landscape of crypto security threats that plague the digital asset space. Beyond direct phishing attempts on individual addresses, the ecosystem faces a myriad of dangers: Exchange Hacks: Centralized exchanges remain prime targets due to the large volume of funds they hold. While security has improved, vulnerabilities can still be exploited. Smart Contract Exploits: For decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, flaws in smart contract code can lead to massive losses, as seen in numerous flash loan attacks and re-entrancy bugs. Wallet Vulnerabilities: Software and hardware wallets, while generally secure, can be compromised through malware, supply chain attacks, or user error. Rug Pulls and Scams: New projects, particularly in the DeFi and NFT sectors, often turn out to be elaborate scams where developers abandon the project and abscond with investor funds. Malware and Ransomware: Malicious software designed to steal private keys or encrypt data until a ransom is paid in cryptocurrency. Social Engineering: Beyond phishing, this includes tactics like impersonation, baiting, and pretexting to manipulate individuals into revealing sensitive information or performing actions against their interest. The constant evolution of these threats necessitates a proactive and multi-layered approach to security. Users and institutions must remain vigilant, constantly update their knowledge, and adopt best practices to mitigate risks. The inherent transparency of blockchain, while a strength, also means that large, identifiable targets are always visible to potential attackers. Safeguarding Your Assets: Actionable Insights from BitMEX and Beyond Given the escalating sophistication of attacks like those targeting the Mt. Gox funds, what can individuals and institutions do to protect their valuable digital assets? The insights gleaned from reports like BitMEX’s underscore the importance of robust security practices. Here are some actionable steps: Verify Everything: Always double-check URLs, email senders, and the legitimacy of any request for information. Assume everything is a potential phishing attempt until proven otherwise. If a link seems suspicious, manually type the official website address into your browser. Hardware Wallets are Key: For significant holdings, use a reputable hardware wallet (e.g., Ledger, Trezor). These devices keep your private keys offline, making them significantly harder for online attackers to access. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enable MFA on all your crypto accounts, especially exchanges. Use strong, unique passwords for each account. Be Wary of Unsolicited Communications: Legitimate entities will rarely ask for your private keys or seed phrase. Be extremely suspicious of emails, messages, or calls requesting this information. Regular Software Updates: Keep your operating system, browser, and crypto-related software up to date. Updates often include critical security patches. Educate Yourself: Stay informed about the latest scam techniques and security best practices. Follow reputable crypto security experts and news sources. Cold Storage for Large Sums: For very large amounts, consider true cold storage solutions, where private keys are generated and stored entirely offline, with no internet connectivity. Test Transactions: When sending large amounts, always send a small test transaction first to ensure the address is correct and the transaction goes through as expected. The lesson from the Mt. Gox targeting is clear: no amount of dormancy or historical significance makes a crypto address immune to determined cybercriminals. Vigilance, education, and the adoption of strong security protocols are your best defense in this evolving digital landscape. The ongoing attempts by hackers to target the Mt. Gox stolen BTC underscore a critical reality in the cryptocurrency world: the battle for digital security is perpetual. With billions of dollars at stake, these sophisticated phishing campaigns, as highlighted by BitMEX research, serve as a potent reminder that vigilance is paramount. From cunning disguises like the Salomon Brothers website to targeting old, high-value addresses, cybercriminals are constantly innovating their methods. As the crypto market matures, so too do the threats it faces. Protecting your assets requires a proactive approach, constant education, and adherence to robust security practices. The future of digital finance hinges on our collective ability to outmaneuver these persistent adversaries and safeguard the integrity of the blockchain ecosystem.

2025-07-09T09:00:00,"Ethereum Is Already Outperforming Bitcoin In July, Is Altcoin Season Here?","With one week already gone in the month of July, Ethereum has already begun to perform better than Bitcoin. While the gap is still very close, the outperformance of Ethereum over Bitcoin for only the second time this year could signal the entrance of better things for the altcoin market. If this continues, then an altcoin season might be on the horizon, as historical data shows it always begins with ETH outperforming BTC. So, let’s take a look at how both assets have been performing. Ethereum Barrels Ahead Of Bitcoin In July So far, in the month of July, the Ethereum price has been putting in more green candles, suggesting that bulls are making their move again. This has led to a small outperformance when compared to the Bitcoin price over this time period and could be the signal that altcoin season could be starting soon. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Could See 180% Explosion As This Indicator Flashes Bullish Divergence Data from the CryptoRank website shows that Ethereum is already up more than 2.50% since the start of July. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin price, while having seen some price increases, is up only 1.20% at the time of this writing. Thus, Ethereum is already performing better in the month of July. If this outperformance continues, then this would be only the second time that the Ethereum price will be doing better than the Bitcoin price so far in 2025. The first was back in May, when the Ethereum price rallied by over 41% in one month. This was major compared to Bitcoin’s 11.1% move in that month. However, while the Bitcoin rally in the month of May saw its price reach new all-time highs, Ethereum continues to struggle and remains below its $4,800 all-time high levels. Nevertheless, Ethereum’s rally did translate to bullishness for the altcoin market as the likes of PEPE and BONK rallied by more than 100% in response to this. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Repeat Parabolic Phase From 2017 And 2021? Here’s The Target Given that Ethereum has led the altcoin season in the past, its outperformance of Bitcoin at this level remains a positive. If it continues, then the altcoin market could start to see further increases in price. And if Ethereum rises another 41% from here, it would put it right on the path to $4,000. However, the month of July has not historically been the best month for Ethereum, with an average return of +5.13%. The whole of the third quarter of the year is also a mixed bag for the altcoin, with an equal number of green and red closes over the last decade. Thus, it remains to be seen how the ETH price will perform this quarter and if it can successfully outpace Bitcoin.

2025-07-09T08:58:09,"Why Is Bitcoin (BTC) Stuck Between $100,000-$110,000? Why Can't It Rise? Bitfinex Reveals The Real Reason!","Bitcoin (BTC) has been stuck in a range for a long time now, with no clear movement either up or down. At this point, Bitcoin has been locked in a tight consolidation range between $100,000 and $110,000 since June 23. While the market is curiously following which direction BTC will move, analysts explained why Bitcoin has not been able to rise. Why Isn't Bitcoin Going Up? At this point, Bitfinex analysts said that investors were hesitant to buy due to the lack of momentum towards new highs, and therefore Bitcoin failed to experience the expected rise. Analysts said investors are cautious about buying BTC at current levels as BTC struggles to find the strength to break above its previous ATH of $111,900. “Bitcoin bulls are hesitant or unable to push prices significantly higher without new catalysts or clearer macro signals. This indicates a continuing lack of power.” Finally, analysts added that the market is currently experiencing profit-taking pressure that is easing as buying appetite wanes. Apart from Bitfinex analysts, FxPro analyst Alex Kuptsikevich also evaluated the latest situation in Bitcoin. Speaking to Coindesk, Kuptsikevich said Bitcoin is facing resistance around $110,000 as investors remain cautious. Stating that the buying momentum in Bitcoin has weakened and the selling pressure has increased, the analyst said that the price is having difficulty holding above $ 110,000, which is why BTC cannot reach new ATHs. Despite Bitcoin’s struggles to reach the new ATH, Kuptsikevich noted that the capital is still trading above the 200-day moving average, a sign that we are still in a bull market. However, the analyst warned that any negative market movements could trigger rapid profit-taking and the price could fall. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-09T08:54:00,"Bitcoin Price Could Break ATH in 7 Days, Here’s What the Data Reveals","The post Bitcoin Price Could Break ATH in 7 Days, Here’s What the Data Reveals appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News It’s been nearly two months since Bitcoin last tried and failed to break past the $112K mark. Three attempts, and still no new all-time high. But that might be about to change. According to recent on-chain data, Bitcoin could be just days away from setting a new record . CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr. has spotted a repeating pattern that could explain what’s building beneath the surface, and why a major breakout might be next. Bitcoin’s New High Just Days Away Over the years, Bitcoin has shown an interesting habit. When its price keeps rising during a bull market and there is no big drop, it often hits a new record within about 50 days. According to Axel Adler Jr, it has now been 47 days since Bitcoin last reached its all-time high, and so far there hasn’t been a sharp fall of more than 20%. If this pattern continues, Bitcoin could break its old record very soon. If there is no deep correction (a decline of more than 20%) during a bull market, a new all-time high typically occurs within 50 days. It's now been 47 days since the last ATH, and we haven’t seen any major pullback. History doesn’t have to repeat itself but the numbers don’t… pic.twitter.com/BS1R0lhNdZ — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) July 9, 2025 Looking back at past bull runs in 2013, 2017, and 2021, the same thing happened. When sellers did not cause big pullbacks, Bitcoin stayed strong and reached new highs in just a few weeks. And the time between each new record has also become shorter over the years, showing how strong buying pressure can push the price up when the market stays calm. Will History Repeat Itself? Axel Adler Jr points out that the same setup is playing out again and data shows the odds are leaning toward a breakout rather than a breakdown. Volatility is calm, no big sell-offs have hit yet, and Bitcoin is holding its ground near its peak levels. . If these calm conditions continue, Bitcoin could easily test new price records within the next 7 days. Weak Dollar is Also Helping Bitcoin Supporting this outlook is another CryptoQuant analyst, Darkfost shared a chart focusing on the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), and it tells a familiar story.

2025-07-09T08:44:09,"Bybit TradFi x Crypto Report: Strategy (MSTR) Trading at 68% Premium as Unique Leveraged BTC Proxy","Dubai, United Arab Emirates, July 9th, 2025, Chainwire Bybit , the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has released a new Bybit TradFi x Crypto Report on Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR), the BTC-focused holding company formerly known as MicroStrategy. The analysis revealed a convoluted valuation picture that challenges traditional pricing logic while highlighting the company’s unprecedented position in the BTC ecosystem. The report suggests investors “disregard the company’s legacy software operations” and examine its true value as a high-beta proxy for its underlying asset, BTC. Holding over half a million BTC at about 2.8% of BTC’s total supply, Strategy is currently trading at a 68% premium to the net value of its BTC treasury at $107 billion market cap. Key Findings: Quantitative Data Suggests Undervaluation: A statistical analysis of the historical relationship between BTC and MSTR performance indicates, on paper, a potential fair value of $468 per share, suggesting the stock may be undervalued by approximately 17.9% at current trading levels of $384. Conservative Leverage Management: Despite its aggressive BTC accumulation, Strategy maintains a prudent loan-to-value ratio of just 11.46%, providing a substantial cushion against market volatility and default risk. However, the company has yet to face a real stress test in the case of a major unexpected BTC correction. Strategy as a Non-Replicable Strategy: The analysis cautioned that Strategy’s valuation premium is likely unique and inimitable, stemming from its first-mover advantage and singular focus on BTC accumulation versus other corporate holders who maintain crypto as non-core treasury assets. The report notes that Strategy’s transformation has created an entirely new asset class in equity markets, providing value in institutional BTC exposure instead of sales revenue. The analysis also suggests that while the company presents significant upside potential in favorable BTC markets, its leveraged structure equally amplifies downside risk.

Some analysts suggest that the cryptocurrency is about to break out and reclaim a crucial resistance level, which could trigger the long-awaited retest of the $200 barrier. Related Reading: Bitcoin Back In ‘Retesting Phase’ After Key Level Reclaim – The Calm Before The Storm? Solana Holds Key Support After recovering from last month’s downtrend, Solana has been attempting to reclaim the crucial $160 level to continue its bullish rally. The cryptocurrency traded between the $140-$180 range for two months, but briefly lost its post-breakout range in late June. Two weeks ago, SOL fell below the $130 area, hitting a two-month low of $126 on June 22. Since then, the altcoin has recovered, fueled by last week’s launch of a Solana staked crypto Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in the US by Rex Shares. Following the news, Solana’s price jumped toward the $160 resistance level but was rejected, hovering between the $145-$155 price range for the past week. On Tuesday, SOL fell below the $150 level, hitting the $147 support before bouncing. Analyst Ali Martinez noted that the $147.59 area is one of the most important support levels for Solana, as losing this level could trigger a pullback to the next key zone around the $141 mark. Similarly, market watcher Man of Bitcoin affirmed that SOL’s key support to maintain is around $141.91, adding that “a sustained break below this level would suggest that wave-C of (ii) is already underway.” The analyst previously warned that there is a potential scenario “with one more low in wave-5,” if the cryptocurrency doesn’t hold about the $148 mark. However, maintaining this support would build a base to target the local highs. SOL About To Retest $160? Analyst Carl Runefelt from The Moon Show affirmed that SOL is “about to break off” a triangle formation and test the $162 resistance. As the price compresses between the upper and lower boundaries, the analyst suggested that the cryptocurrency’s breakout is around the corner. Notably, Solana has been forming a one-week symmetrical triangle pattern in the daily chart. If the cryptocurrency successfully breaks above the $152-$153 zone, it could see a 10.87% jump toward the technical target of $167. The Cryptonomist highlighted that SOL broke out of a multi-day diagonal resistance on Sunday, which was retested and confirmed as support after bouncing around the $147 twice since the breakout. Related Reading: 50% Bitcoin Price Crash On The Horizon? Analyst Reveals $60,000 Target The analyst considers that the cryptocurrency is preparing for a continuation of its rally, targeting the one-week high and resistance of $160. Meanwhile, Crypto Jelle noted that despite the April downside deviation, Solana continues to trade within its $125-$180 Macro Range, currently hovering around the mid-range. To him, “it looks like it’s just waiting for BTC to break out. Once it reclaims $160, $200 should come quickly. Above there, new all-time highs are within reach.” As of this writing, Solana is trading at $151.51, a 3.6% increase in the weekly timeframe.

2025-07-09T08:20:24,"Altcoin Season Index: Unveiling Crucial Crypto Market Trends for Strategic Investing","Are you tracking the pulse of the digital asset world? The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index at a low 22 points, as reported by CoinMarketCap, is a significant signal for anyone involved in cryptocurrency investing . This figure, down four points from the previous day, clearly indicates that the market is firmly entrenched in what’s known as ‘Bitcoin Season.’ But what exactly does this mean for your portfolio, and how should you navigate these crucial crypto market trends ? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: Decoding the Metric The Altcoin Season Index is a vital tool for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, providing a snapshot of the market’s current phase. Tracked diligently by CoinMarketCap (CMC), this index offers insights into whether the broader altcoin market is outperforming Bitcoin or vice versa. It’s not just a random number; it’s a carefully calculated metric designed to help you understand capital flow and market sentiment. Here’s how the index works: Scope: The index specifically monitors the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap. Importantly, it excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens, focusing purely on the speculative and growth-oriented assets. Timeframe: It assesses the performance of these top 100 coins against Bitcoin over a 90-day period. This longer timeframe helps smooth out daily volatility and provides a more reliable indication of sustained trends. Thresholds: Altcoin Season: For the market to be declared in ‘Altcoin Season,’ at least 75% of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin during the 90-day window. This signifies a broad-based rally in altcoins. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, ‘Bitcoin Season’ is declared when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin over the same period. This indicates Bitcoin’s dominance and often a consolidation phase for altcoins. Score Range: The index itself ranges from 1 to 100. A higher score leans towards Altcoin Season, while a lower score, like the current 22, points squarely to Bitcoin Season. The current reading of 22 is a strong indicator that Bitcoin is leading the charge, absorbing much of the market’s liquidity and attention. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but it demands a different approach to your cryptocurrency investing strategy. Bitcoin Season Explained: Why Bitcoin Dominates the Crypto Market? With the Altcoin Season Index firmly in the Bitcoin Season territory, it’s crucial to understand what this phase entails and why Bitcoin often takes the lead. Bitcoin Season is characterized by a period where the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), sees significant price appreciation and often outperforms most alternative cryptocurrencies. This isn’t just a random occurrence; it’s often driven by several fundamental factors and market dynamics. Historically, Bitcoin often acts as the primary gateway for new capital entering the crypto space. Its established reputation, larger market capitalization, and increasing institutional adoption make it a perceived ‘safer’ asset compared to the more volatile altcoins. During periods of uncertainty, or when major economic shifts occur, investors often flock to Bitcoin as a store of value, akin to digital gold. This ‘flight to safety’ narrative strengthens Bitcoin’s dominance. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s halving cycles play a significant role. These pre-programmed events, which cut the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market by half approximately every four years, often precede major bull runs. The anticipation of a halving, or the post-halving supply shock, can drive considerable interest and investment into BTC, leading to periods of strong Bitcoin Season where its price action dictates the overall sentiment of the crypto market trends . During a Bitcoin Season, you might observe: Capital Rotation: Funds tend to flow out of altcoins and into Bitcoin. Lower Altcoin Performance: Many altcoins might stagnate, consolidate, or even decline in value relative to Bitcoin. Increased Bitcoin Dominance: Bitcoin’s market cap percentage of the total crypto market increases. Understanding these dynamics is vital for effective cryptocurrency investing , as it informs when to prioritize Bitcoin accumulation versus seeking high-growth altcoin opportunities. When Will Altcoin Season Return? Analyzing Altcoin Performance While we are currently in a Bitcoin Season , the crypto market is cyclical, and attention will eventually shift back to altcoins. The question on many investors’ minds is: when will the next Altcoin Season begin, and what drives superior Altcoin Performance ? Altcoin Season typically kicks off after Bitcoin has had its major run-up, often reaching a new all-time high or consolidating after a significant rally. This allows capital that flowed into Bitcoin to then rotate into altcoins, seeking higher percentage gains. The underlying principle is that investors, having seen substantial returns on Bitcoin, start looking for the next opportunities, and altcoins, with their smaller market caps, offer the potential for more explosive growth. Several catalysts can ignite an Altcoin Season: Bitcoin Consolidation: After a strong Bitcoin rally, if BTC enters a period of sideways trading or slight correction, investors often feel more comfortable deploying capital into riskier altcoins. New Narratives and Technological Breakthroughs: The emergence of groundbreaking technologies or compelling narratives can drive specific sectors of the altcoin market. Examples include the DeFi summer of 2020, the NFT boom of 2021, or the recent excitement around AI and GameFi tokens. Ethereum Upgrades: As the second-largest cryptocurrency and the backbone for many altcoins, significant upgrades to the Ethereum network (like the Merge or future scaling solutions) can often trigger broader altcoin rallies. Increased Retail Interest: A surge in new retail investors often brings fresh capital into altcoins, as they are drawn to the promise of quick, high returns. During an Altcoin Season, you’ll often see a wide array of altcoins, from large-cap projects to mid and even small-cap gems, experiencing parabolic growth. Identifying these opportunities requires diligent research and an understanding of the evolving crypto market trends . Navigating the Cycles: Strategic Cryptocurrency Investing Given the cyclical nature of the Altcoin Season Index and the distinct phases of Bitcoin and Altcoin Season, a flexible and informed cryptocurrency investing strategy is paramount. Understanding which phase the market is in can significantly influence your portfolio’s performance. Here’s a comparison of strategies for each season: Market Phase Primary Strategy Actions to Consider Risks to Mitigate Bitcoin Season (Altcoin Season Index Low) Accumulation of Bitcoin and Stablecoins Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) into Bitcoin. Holding a higher percentage of stablecoins to capitalize on potential altcoin dips. Researching promising altcoin projects for future investment. Exercising patience; avoiding impulsive altcoin buys. Missing out on small altcoin rallies. Impatience leading to premature altcoin purchases. Underestimating Bitcoin’s continued strength. Altcoin Season (Altcoin Season Index High) Diversified Altcoin Exposure & Profit Taking Gradually rotating profits from Bitcoin into selected altcoins. Diversifying across different altcoin sectors (DeFi, NFTs, AI, Gaming). Setting profit targets and taking partial profits to de-risk. Rebalancing portfolio towards stablecoins or Bitcoin after significant gains. Over-exposure to highly volatile altcoins. Greed leading to not taking profits. Chasing pumps; investing in projects without proper research. The key is to adapt. During Bitcoin Season, patience and strategic accumulation of BTC or stablecoins are often rewarded. As the market transitions into Altcoin Season, a more aggressive, yet diversified, approach to altcoins becomes viable. Always remember that due diligence is crucial; don’t just invest based on hype. Research the fundamentals of each project, understand its use case, team, and community, to ensure sustainable altcoin performance . Beyond the Index: What Drives Crypto Market Trends? While the Altcoin Season Index provides a clear indicator of market sentiment and capital flow between Bitcoin and altcoins, it’s essential to understand the broader forces that shape overall crypto market trends . The cryptocurrency market does not operate in a vacuum; it’s influenced by a complex interplay of global economic, technological, and regulatory factors. Key drivers include: Macroeconomic Conditions: Global inflation rates, interest rate decisions by central banks, and overall economic growth or recession fears significantly impact investor appetite for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. When traditional markets face headwinds, crypto can sometimes follow suit, or in some cases, act as a hedge depending on the narrative. Regulatory Developments: Government policies and regulations regarding cryptocurrencies can have a profound impact. Favorable regulations can foster innovation and adoption, while restrictive measures can stifle growth and lead to market corrections. News from major economies about crypto frameworks is always closely watched. Technological Advancements: Continuous innovation within the blockchain space drives new narratives and investment opportunities. Developments in scaling solutions (Layer 2s), new consensus mechanisms, cross-chain interoperability, and privacy technologies can shift market focus and ignite specific altcoin sectors. Institutional Adoption: The increasing involvement of large financial institutions, corporations, and even sovereign wealth funds in cryptocurrency lending, trading, and holding adds legitimacy and significant capital to the market. Their entry can trigger substantial rallies and stabilize certain assets. Geopolitical Events: Global conflicts, political instability, or major international agreements can create uncertainty, influencing investor behavior and leading to shifts in capital allocation within the crypto market. Understanding these macro factors, in conjunction with the Altcoin Season Index , provides a more holistic view of the market, enabling more informed cryptocurrency investing decisions. Challenges and Opportunities in Current Market Conditions The current market, characterized by a low Altcoin Season Index and a prevailing Bitcoin Season , presents both challenges and unique opportunities for investors. The primary challenge lies in the potential for continued underperformance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin, leading to frustration for those heavily invested in them. Volatility remains a constant, and rapid price swings can test even the most seasoned investor’s resolve. However, this phase also offers significant opportunities: Accumulation Phase: For long-term investors, a Bitcoin Season can be an ideal time to accumulate Bitcoin at potentially lower prices before the next major bull run. It also provides an opportunity to research and identify promising altcoin projects that might be undervalued, positioning for the eventual return of Altcoin Performance . Portfolio Rebalancing: It’s an excellent period to re-evaluate your portfolio, trim underperforming assets, and reallocate towards stronger positions or stablecoins, preparing for the next market shift. Learning and Research: With less frenetic price action in altcoins, this is a prime time to deepen your understanding of blockchain technology, new protocols, and emerging narratives within the crypto market trends . This knowledge will be invaluable when Altcoin Season eventually arrives. Patience is truly a virtue in these market conditions. Rushing into trades or panicking out of positions can lead to significant losses. Instead, focus on building a robust strategy for your cryptocurrency investing that accounts for market cycles. Conclusion: Preparing for the Next Shift in the Crypto Market The Altcoin Season Index serves as a powerful compass, currently pointing towards a dominant Bitcoin Season . While this signals a period where Bitcoin is likely to lead the charge, it doesn’t mean altcoins are irrelevant. Instead, it highlights the cyclical nature of the crypto market trends and the importance of adapting your cryptocurrency investing strategies accordingly. By understanding the dynamics that drive altcoin performance and Bitcoin’s dominance, you can position yourself strategically, whether it’s accumulating Bitcoin during its season or diversifying into promising altcoins when the market shifts. Stay informed, remain patient, and continue to educate yourself to navigate the exciting, yet challenging, world of digital assets.

Bitcoin remains mostly unfazed and shows growing confidence among investors. The institutional demand also remains strong with steady ETF inflows. New Tariffs Incoming President Trump shared in a Tuesday evening post that he is all set to announce new trade tariffs targeting at least 7 countries, with more to be followed later. This would spark sudden volatility across global stock markets and crypto. The letters will announce new tariffs of 25% to 40%, set to take effect on August 1, 2025. Will Crypto Market Drop Again? He has warned earlier that if 14 countries don’t strike trade deals by early next month, then tariffs will jump back to the higher April levels. Recently, he slapped tariffs of 25% to 40% on 14 countries, and it quickly impacted the crypto market. Within 24 hours, the total market had dropped 4.5% and all the major coins were trading in red. Bitcoin dipped 1.56% to just under $108,000, while Ethereum fell 1.89% to $2,535. Dogecoin saw the biggest drop, sliding 4.78%. BREAKING: U.S. TO IMPOSE TARIFFS ON 7 COUNTRIES STARTING AUGUST 1. EXPECT VOLATILITY FOR MARKETS & #XRP pic.twitter.com/SrMxDARndu — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) July 8, 2025 Stocks like Microstrategy and Robinhood also closed lower, and Bitcoin mining stocks dropped even more sharply. The impact was seen in the broader market, too. The Dow, S&P 500, and NASDAQ all dropped. This was similar to what happened in April, when U.S.-China trade tensions sent Bitcoin below $80K and triggered major sell-offs. Trump has also announced an additional 10% tariffs on countries that support BRICS. With more tariffs set to kick in on August 1, the crypto market could stay under pressure, and further declines are also possible. Critics warn that Trump’s tough tariff plans could hurt the global economy and even push the U.S. toward a recession. But he has held by them and says that it’s necessary. Trump Says Tariffs Have No Effect on Inflation The U.S. just added over $350 billion in debt in a single day, hitting a new all-time high and the biggest spike since 2024. Analysts claim that this is bullish for Bitcoin and crypto as concerns over fiat stability continue to grow. The hopes for a July rate cut have also faded from 90% to just 61%. The rising tariffs and inflation fears may keep the Fed from easing, and this could limit crypto’s upside. However, Trump claims that according to a new CEA study, tariffs had “zero” impact on inflation. He is now calling out Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates immediately. Bullish Momentum For Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s breakout is strong, and the market is holding up. Some analysts believe that the worst-case scenarios, including a potential war, are already priced in. With rising money supply, there could be bullish months for both crypto and stocks, targeting $120K–$130K for BTC. Almost no reaction in the charts, Trump imposing 25% tariff on Japan and South Korea today. I keep telling that the absolute worst case including a potential war is currently priced in, meanwhile the money supply keeps increasing! Bullish months ahead for Stocks and Crypto — Doctor Profit (@DrProfitCrypto) July 7, 2025 For Bitcoin to stay bullish, it needs to hold above $99,000.

As the officials noted that crypto kiosks mainly attract users seeking anonymity to covert illegal funds, the industry leaders supported the government’s decision to ban Bitcoin banks. New Zealand Government’s Strict Action on Money Laundering Associate Justice Minister Nicole McKee announced the decision on Wednesday. The legislation is creating a bill that expands powers for police and regulators to address financial crime in the country. McKee emphasised that the government is serious about targeting criminals and enforcing the powers of regulators to crack down on money laundering criminals. She stated, “We are committed to combating illicit fund flows and criminal activities associated with cash and cryptocurrency.” Key Highlights of the Crypto Kiosks Ban in New Zealand Ban on Cryptocurrency ATMs: The reform will halt the use of approximately 220 crypto ATMs in the country. It aims to mitigate any illicit use of financial systems Targeting Offshore Crypto Crimes: After the Ministerial Advisory Group on Transnational, Serious and Organised Crime highlighted that criminals often use crypto ATMs to trade with offshore criminals for funding drug import and scams, the government took immediate action to ban crypto ATMs. Limiting International Transfers: In order to curb money laundering and criminal finance, New Zealand is capping international transfers at $5,000. This move will also enhance the country’s financial surveillance capabilities. Enforcing AML and CFT in New Zealand Nicole McKee assured that the new approach will develop more clarity and consistency for businesses while preventing criminal misuse of financial systems.

2025-07-09T07:50:03,"Pioneering Bitcoin Service: Bow Valley Credit Union Transforms Crypto Banking in Canada","BitcoinWorld Pioneering Bitcoin Service: Bow Valley Credit Union Transforms Crypto Banking in Canada In a groundbreaking move that signals a significant shift in the Canadian financial landscape, Bow Valley Credit Union (BVCU), a prominent financial institution based in Alberta, has unveiled the country’s first-ever “Bitcoin Gateway.” This innovative Bitcoin service empowers BVCU members to directly purchase Bitcoin (BTC) using Canadian dollars through their existing credit union accounts. This development, announced via a Business Wire press release, marks a pivotal moment for traditional financial institutions venturing into the world of digital assets. The initiative was brought to fruition through strategic collaborations with Balance, a leading BTC custodian, and Bull Bitcoin, an API provider known for its robust cryptocurrency solutions. This strategic integration by a Canadian credit union is not just a technological upgrade; it’s a bold statement about the future of finance, blending the reliability of conventional banking with the innovation of cryptocurrency. What Does This Revolutionary Bitcoin Service Entail? The core of BVCU’s new offering is its “Bitcoin Gateway,” a seamless integration that allows members to interact with Bitcoin without leaving their familiar banking environment. Traditionally, purchasing Bitcoin involved navigating third-party exchanges, often requiring separate accounts, verification processes, and transfers between banks and crypto platforms. BVCU’s solution simplifies this significantly, offering unparalleled convenience and security. Direct Account Access: Members can initiate Bitcoin purchases directly from their BVCU accounts, treating BTC much like any other investment product or currency exchange. Canadian Dollar Transactions: All transactions are conducted in Canadian dollars, eliminating the need for foreign exchange conversions often associated with international crypto platforms. Enhanced Security: By partnering with Balance, a regulated and trusted Bitcoin custodian, BVCU ensures that members’ digital assets are held securely, mitigating risks often associated with self-custody or less regulated exchanges. Simplified User Experience: The goal is to make acquiring Bitcoin as straightforward as paying a bill or transferring funds online, removing common barriers to entry for new crypto users. This initiative represents a significant step towards mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, especially for those who have been hesitant due to perceived complexities or security concerns. For a Bow Valley Credit Union member, it means embracing the future of finance with the confidence that their institution is leading the way. Why Is This a Game Changer for Canadian Credit Unions and Crypto Banking? BVCU’s pioneering move carries profound implications for the broader financial sector in Canada and beyond. It challenges the traditional reluctance of banks and credit unions to engage with cryptocurrencies, setting a precedent for how established financial institutions can adapt to the digital asset revolution. For Canadian credit unions, this opens a new frontier: First-Mover Advantage: BVCU has positioned itself as an innovator, potentially attracting new members who are keen on crypto but prefer the security and familiarity of a regulated financial institution. Meeting Member Demand: As interest in Bitcoin grows, credit unions face increasing pressure to offer relevant services. BVCU is directly addressing this demand, preventing members from seeking these services elsewhere. Regulatory Clarity: By working with partners like Balance and Bull Bitcoin, BVCU is navigating the complex regulatory landscape for crypto banking, potentially paving a clearer path for others to follow. Diversification of Services: Integrating Bitcoin allows credit unions to expand their service offerings, moving beyond traditional loans and deposits into the burgeoning digital asset space. This initiative demonstrates that traditional finance and digital assets are not mutually exclusive but can indeed converge to create a more comprehensive and user-friendly financial ecosystem. It’s a testament to the forward-thinking approach of Bow Valley Credit Union. Seamlessly Buy Bitcoin Canada: Benefits for Members The primary beneficiaries of BVCU’s new Bitcoin Gateway are its members. The service addresses several pain points associated with cryptocurrency acquisition, making it more accessible and secure for the average Canadian. Here’s how members stand to benefit: Unprecedented Convenience: No more linking external bank accounts to crypto exchanges or waiting for interbank transfers. The entire process to buy Bitcoin Canada is integrated within their existing banking interface. Enhanced Security and Trust: Members are dealing directly with their trusted credit union, which in turn partners with regulated entities like Balance for custody. This significantly reduces the risk of scams, hacks, or mismanaged funds often associated with less reputable platforms. Simplified Compliance: The credit union handles much of the regulatory compliance (KYC/AML), ensuring that transactions adhere to Canadian financial laws without burdening the individual member with complex procedures. Financial Inclusion: For individuals who might find standalone crypto exchanges intimidating, this integrated service provides a familiar and safe entry point into the digital asset economy. Access to Financial Innovation: Members can participate in the growing digital asset market, potentially diversifying their portfolios and exploring new investment opportunities with the backing of their financial institution. This strategic move by Bow Valley Credit Union is a clear signal that mainstream finance is ready to embrace the future, making it easier for Canadians to participate in the global Bitcoin economy. Challenges and Opportunities for Mainstream Crypto Banking Adoption While BVCU’s move is commendable, the path to widespread crypto banking integration is not without its challenges. These include regulatory hurdles, technological complexities, and the need for significant customer education. Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite recent clarifications, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains dynamic. Financial institutions must continuously adapt to evolving rules and guidelines. Technological Integration: Seamlessly integrating blockchain technology with legacy banking systems is a complex undertaking, requiring robust APIs, secure data management, and continuous maintenance. Security Risks: While BVCU mitigates this through a trusted custodian, managing digital assets inherently carries unique security risks, including cyberattacks and sophisticated scams. Customer Education: Many traditional banking customers may lack understanding of Bitcoin and its volatility. Credit unions must invest in educating their members to ensure responsible engagement. Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility can be a concern for conservative financial institutions and their members. Managing expectations and providing clear disclaimers are crucial. Opportunities: New Revenue Streams: Offering crypto services can unlock new fee-based revenue streams for credit unions. Competitive Differentiation: Being an early adopter provides a significant competitive edge, attracting tech-savvy younger demographics and existing members seeking modern financial solutions. Innovation Leadership: Institutions that embrace crypto position themselves as leaders in financial innovation, enhancing their brand reputation. Future-Proofing: As digital assets become more integral to the global economy, integrating them now prepares financial institutions for the future of finance. The decision by this Canadian credit union highlights a willingness to navigate these challenges for the immense opportunities that lie ahead in the realm of Bitcoin services. The Broader Landscape: Will Other Canadian Credit Unions Follow BVCU’s Lead? BVCU’s initiative sets a powerful precedent. The question now is whether other financial institutions, particularly other Canadian credit unions and even major banks, will follow suit. The pressure to innovate and cater to evolving customer demands is mounting. Several factors could influence this: Regulatory Comfort: As regulators provide clearer guidelines, more institutions will feel comfortable entering the space. Technological Partnerships: The availability of reliable and secure third-party solutions, like those provided by Balance and Bull Bitcoin, makes integration more feasible. Customer Demand: Increasing member inquiries and the desire to buy Bitcoin Canada easily will push institutions to act. Competitive Pressure: No financial institution wants to be left behind while competitors capture new market segments. This pioneering step by Bow Valley Credit Union could well be the spark that ignites a broader trend, making integrated crypto banking a standard offering across Canada’s financial sector. Actionable Insights: What This Means for You and the Future of Finance For individuals and institutions alike, BVCU’s Bitcoin Gateway offers valuable insights and potential pathways forward. For Individual Members: Explore the Service: If you are a BVCU member interested in Bitcoin, take advantage of this convenient and secure service to buy Bitcoin Canada. Educate Yourself: Even with simplified access, understanding Bitcoin’s fundamentals, risks, and potential rewards is crucial. Start Small: Consider starting with smaller amounts to get comfortable with the process and market dynamics. For Other Financial Institutions: Assess Demand: Gauge your members’ interest in cryptocurrency services. Research Partnerships: Explore collaborations with established crypto custodians and API providers to leverage their expertise and infrastructure for a secure Bitcoin service. Engage with Regulators: Proactively work with regulatory bodies to understand compliance requirements and contribute to shaping future policies for crypto banking. Prioritize Security: Any venture into crypto must put robust security measures and reliable custody solutions at the forefront. The move by Bow Valley Credit Union is a blueprint for how traditional finance can embrace innovation responsibly. The Future is Here: Bridging Traditional and Digital Finance The launch of BVCU’s Bitcoin Gateway is more than just a new product offering; it represents a significant step in the ongoing convergence of traditional finance and the decentralized world of cryptocurrencies. It signifies a future where accessing digital assets is as straightforward and secure as any other banking transaction. This integration enhances accessibility, reduces friction, and builds trust, which are critical for mainstream adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As the digital economy continues to evolve, the ability of financial institutions to adapt and innovate will determine their relevance. BVCU has demonstrated remarkable foresight and courage in becoming the first Canadian credit union to offer such a direct Bitcoin service, setting a high bar for others to follow. This initiative paves the way for a more integrated, efficient, and accessible financial system for all Canadians.

2025-07-09T07:40:00,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Unveiling Market Optimism in the Greed Zone","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Unveiling Market Optimism in the Greed Zone The cryptocurrency world is abuzz! The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a popular barometer for understanding market psychology, has recently climbed to a significant 66, firmly planting itself in the ‘Greed’ zone. This upward movement, up one point from the previous day as of July 9, suggests a palpable shift in crypto market sentiment . But what exactly does this number tell us, and how should investors interpret this wave of optimism? Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Does it Measure? At its core, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index aims to distill the complex emotions driving the cryptocurrency market into a single, digestible number. Developed by Alternative, a software development platform, this index ranges from 0 to 100. A score of 0 screams “extreme fear,” often indicating potential buying opportunities as investors panic sell. Conversely, a score of 100 shouts “extreme greed,” which might signal an impending correction as the market becomes overbought. The current reading of 66 sits squarely in the ‘Greed’ territory, suggesting that optimism, and perhaps a touch of irrational exuberance, is currently prevalent among participants. How is Investor Sentiment Calculated? A Look at Key Factors Understanding how the index arrives at its score is crucial for any investor seeking to gauge investor sentiment accurately. The index doesn’t rely on a single metric but rather a blend of six distinct factors, each weighted to contribute to the final reading. These factors provide a holistic view of the market’s psychological state: Volatility (25%): This component measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility often signals fear, while stable markets can foster greed. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This factor analyzes the current volume and market momentum, comparing it to the last 30 and 90-day averages. High buying volumes and strong momentum typically indicate a greedy market. Social Media (15%): The index scans Twitter hashtags and Reddit posts for crypto-related terms, analyzing the speed and number of posts. A surge in positive sentiment or overly optimistic discussions can push the index towards greed. Surveys (15%): This component, though currently paused, involves polling a large group of crypto investors weekly to gather their direct sentiment about the market. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin dominance refers to Bitcoin’s market cap share relative to the total crypto market cap. A rising dominance often suggests investors are moving into Bitcoin, perceived as a safer asset, which can indicate fear in altcoins. Conversely, falling dominance can signal a risk-on environment where altcoins are gaining traction, often associated with greed. Google Trends (10%): This factor analyzes Google search queries related to cryptocurrencies. A spike in searches for “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “crypto crash” might indicate fear, while searches for “how to buy Bitcoin” during a bull run could signal greed. Navigating the ‘Greed’ Zone: What Does High Crypto Market Sentiment Mean for You? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index hovers in the ‘Greed’ zone, as it is now at 66, it suggests that investors are generally optimistic and perhaps becoming overconfident. Historically, periods of extreme greed can precede market corrections, as assets become overvalued. However, it’s also true that bull runs can extend for significant periods, with the index remaining in ‘Greed’ for weeks or even months. This elevated crypto market sentiment indicates that many are expecting further price appreciation. For investors, this current reading presents both opportunities and risks. On one hand, strong positive sentiment can fuel continued upward price action, especially for Bitcoin and major altcoins. On the other hand, it’s a time for caution. The adage “be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful” often rings true in crypto. While not a precise timing tool, a high ‘Greed’ score serves as a reminder to reassess your portfolio, consider profit-taking on over-extended assets, and avoid impulsive decisions driven by FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Understanding Market Volatility: A Constant Companion in Crypto One of the most significant factors influencing the index is market volatility . The crypto market is notorious for its rapid price swings, and these movements directly impact the ‘Volatility’ component of the index. High volatility can stem from various sources: macroeconomic news, regulatory announcements, major hacks, or even large institutional buys/sells. When the market experiences sharp, unpredictable movements, it often triggers fear, pushing the index lower. Conversely, a period of relatively stable upward movement, even if prices are rising, might contribute to a sense of calm optimism that translates into greed. Staying informed about the causes of volatility can help you better anticipate shifts in the index and overall market sentiment. The Strategic Role of Bitcoin Dominance in Market Dynamics The Bitcoin dominance metric, though only 10% of the index’s weighting, plays a strategic role in reflecting broader market dynamics. When Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap increases, it often indicates that investors are seeking refuge in what they perceive as the most secure and established cryptocurrency. This flight to safety usually happens during periods of uncertainty or fear, as capital flows out of riskier altcoins. Conversely, when Bitcoin dominance declines, it often signals a “altcoin season,” where capital flows from Bitcoin into various altcoins, driven by higher risk appetite and the pursuit of greater returns. This shift is typically associated with a greedy market, as investors become more confident in exploring higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities across the altcoin spectrum. Conclusion: Navigating the Market with Informed Investor Sentiment The Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 66, firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone, is a clear indicator of prevailing optimism in the crypto market. While it’s not a crystal ball for future prices, it offers invaluable insights into collective investor sentiment . By understanding its components—from market volatility and momentum to social media trends and Bitcoin dominance —investors can gain a more nuanced perspective beyond just price charts. This index serves as a powerful reminder to approach the market with a balanced perspective, leveraging periods of heightened greed for strategic re-evaluation and ensuring you’re not swept away by emotional trading. Use this tool as part of a broader analytical framework to make more informed and rational investment decisions in the dynamic world of digital assets.

2025-07-09T07:37:25,"CRO price posts 20% single-day rally on inclusion in Trump Media-backed ETF, eyes $0.105","CRO price staged a powerful rally Tuesday, climbing over 20% after news broke of its inclusion in a proposed Trump Media-backed Blue Chip ETF, sparking renewed bullish momentum for the embattled token. Cronos ( CRO ) surged over 20% on Tuesday after Trump Media and Technology Group filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a Blue Chip ETF that includes CRO alongside Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), and Ripple ( XRP ). Notably, Cronos received a 5% allocation, which is more than Ripple’s 2%. If approved, the ETF will be listed on NYSE Arca and its assets will be custodied by Foris DAX Trust Company, Crypto.com’s custody arm. The news sparked a sharp breakout, sending CRO price from its July 8 open at $0.081 to an intraday high of $0.10, breaking above a descending trendline and out of the recent consolidation range. The rally pushed the price through key moving averages and briefly tested a previous swing-high resistance. It also approached the 200-day SMA, now acting as its dynamic resistance. As of now, CRO price has pulled back slightly, trading around $0.092, just above the horizontal support near $0.089–0.090. This area, which previously acted as resistance in late April – early May, is now being retested as support following the breakout. Holding this level would be bullish, confirming a successful retest and setting up for a potential move back toward the $0.101 (200-day SMA) and $0.105 resistance zone.

These bullish catalysts may offer a much-needed respite for CRO holders, following a major blow in March when Cronos voted to reissue 70 billion previously burned CRO tokens. The controversial move drew sharp backlash from the community, raising centralization concerns.

2025-07-09T07:34:25,"This Overlooked Binance Metric Might Predict Bitcoin’s Next Major Move","Bitcoin has mostly traded between $105,000 and $110,000 this month, hovering near its all-time high. Yet on Binance, perpetual futures prices continue to lag behind spot prices. The continued negative Spot-Perpetual Price Delta on Binance since December 2024 reveals a structural imbalance. Spot Leads, Futures Lags In its latest analysis, CryptoQuant explained that this negative delta indicates the spot price of Bitcoin has consistently traded above perpetual futures prices. This means that the current rally is being driven largely by spot buyers rather than leveraged futures traders on Binance. When the delta initially flipped from positive to negative in December, Bitcoin reached its then-all-time high, with aggressive long positioning on Binance’s perpetual markets, while the spot price trailed. Even after BTC’s decline to $74,000 and subsequent recovery to a new peak, the delta has remained negative. Such a trend highlights that perpetual markets are still not fully participating in the upside momentum. This behavior could reflect a cautious environment among leveraged traders, which could mean that the market is in an accumulation phase where supply is absorbed gradually by spot buyers before a potential continuation of the rally. Importantly, the current structure implies a healthier rally as it is not being driven by excessive leverage, which reduces the risk of sharp liquidations that can destabilize the price. However, a flip in the delta from negative to positive would signal an influx of leveraged longs, as it is often a precursor to local tops or corrections, since liquidity becomes an attractive target for market makers and whales. As such, while spot demand remains strong, the market’s next phase will likely be defined by how and when Binance’s perpetual markets catch up, with the delta acting as a key signal for potential volatility ahead. Accumulation by Institutions Against this backdrop of spot-driven strength on Binance, Bitfinex Alpha’s latest report revealed that bulls are maintaining structural control. Bitcoin has defended the short-term holders’ realized price of $98,220, hinting at constructive bullish momentum even amid volatility. The rising STH cost basis near $99,474 indicates continued accumulation by newer participants. This includes institutions via ETFs. Meanwhile, whales are distributing holdings and have offloaded over 14,000 BTC since June 30, while retail and institutions absorb supply, thereby driving momentum amid macro uncertainty and equity market strength.
