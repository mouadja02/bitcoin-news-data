2025-07-09T03:43:26,"Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, XRP ETFs See Record AUM as Traders Warn of ‘Summer Lull’","Bitcoin is holding firm near $108,700 even as traditional markets recoil from renewed trade tensions sparked by Donald Trump. The U.S. president signaled plans to hike tariffs on imports, potentially as high as 50%, citing ongoing friction with the European Union over tech regulations. The rhetoric sent Asian equities lower for a third time in four sessions, pushed copper futures down in London, and dragged U.S. equity futures into the red. Yet Bitcoin remained largely unfazed, suggesting crypto investors are either discounting the macro noise or viewing BTC as increasingly insulated from global policy risk, some opined. “Bitcoin’s slight price drop from Trump's tariff plans showcases the digital asset's resilient nature and long-term investor confidence,” said Han Xu, Director at HashKey Capital, said in a Telegram message. “We’re optimistic this trend will continue even amid short-term volatility.” Still, there's clear hesitation at these levels. “Buyers are quickly letting off steam,” noted FxPro’s Alex Kuptsikevich. “BTC keeps getting pushed down near $110K, and while the 50-day moving average is attracting dip buyers, sellers are just as active.” He added that overall market capitalization, while still up 1.8% on the week, slipped 0.6% in the past 24 hours to $3.35 trillion, signaling another “bout of indecision” at the top. That choppiness persists even as crypto ETF inflows continue. CoinShares reported its 12th consecutive week of net inflows, with nearly $1 billion entering crypto funds last week, and over $790 million of that amount going into Bitcoin. Ether-tracked products brought in $226 million, Solana $22 million, and XRP $11 million. Total ETF assets under management have reached an all-time high of $188 billion. But under the hood, there are signs of fatigue. Bitcoin’s on-chain activity and implied volatility have dropped to their lowest in nearly two years, according to The Block. Glassnode called it a “summer lull,” pointing to collapsing trading volumes and a rising concentration of unrealized gains among long-term holders, or factors that could trigger a sharper move if sentiment turns. Despite the lack of momentum, markets remain firmly risk-on, just nervously so. “Capital continues to move away from the 200-day moving average,” Kuptsikevich added, “which shows the market still leans bullish. But any shift in tone could lead to quick profit-taking.”",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/09/bitcoin-ether-solana-xrp-etfs-see-record-aum-as-traders-warn-of-summer-lull,"BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|XRP","Markets|Trading|Markets|News",cryptocompare

2025-07-09T03:00:12,"Bitcoin Bull Flag Breakout Confirmed — What Happens Next?","Bitcoin has broken out of the orange bull flag on the 1-hour chart. After consolidating within a tight range, the breakout suggests that momentum is shifting back in favor of the bulls, and potentially setting the stage for a rapid push toward higher resistance levels. Pullback Or Launchpad? What Bitcoin’s Next Move Could Look Like According to MaxFINEancial’s latest analysis on X, he highlighted that a large green double bottom is forming within an orange bull flag on the 1-hour chart, which is a bullish continuation setup. Related Reading: Bitcoin Heating Up? NVT Golden Cross Hints At Potential Local Top The local high was a test of the trigger line of the double bottom, which signaled intent from the bulls. BTC is retesting the upper edge of the bull flag, aligning with the 1-hour 200-day MA, a critical dynamic support level that often dictates short-term momentum. MaxFINEancial projects a small pink bullish pennant forming and setting up for a continuation move higher. However, a rare diamond top pattern could also be taking shape, a bearish reversal formation that, if validated, may trigger a sharp downside move. If BTC loses the 1-hour 200-day MA, he advises shifting focus to the 4-hour 200-day MA, which is the line of defense. The important bullish area targets are $113,700, $115,867, $117,030, and $122,143, while the bearish diamond top target is $103,079. Market analyst A_y has also highlighted that Bitcoin is consolidating below the $110,000 resistance on the 4-hour chart, with the structure forming a textbook ascending triangle. This setup is the rising higher lows against horizontal resistance that precedes a strong breakout. If BTC manages to break above $110,000, the move could accelerate toward the $112,000 to $114,000 range, marking a bullish trend. However, failure to breach this ceiling may lead to a pullback toward $104,000, where previous demand has stepped in. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is neutral, suggesting that there is room for momentum to build, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a bullish crossover, that is hinting at potential upward momentum, BTC is still trading below the EMA, which means bulls need to prove strength for a confirmed breakout. Bitcoin Stable At $108,000 — Market Cooling, Not Crashing In an update on X, Chad_TattoosMD also emphasized that Bitcoin is showing resilience and holding strong around the $108,000 level despite the recent dip. BTC is maintaining its structure and refusing to break lower, which is a sign of underlying buyer confidence. Related Reading: Bitcoin Traders Are Betting Against the Rally, Will It Backfire? The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at neutral 54, indicating no extreme momentum in either direction. Meanwhile, the Stochastic (RSI) has entered overbought territory and is now cooling off, hinting at a potential short-term pullback. However, nothing on the chart suggests a breakdown is imminent. Chad_TattoosMD also points to $106,000 as the key support, and $112,000 as the resistance, which remains in a tight zone on the chart.

2025-07-09T01:31:08,"Hype fades as NFT platforms lose users","The NFT market has reached its lowest point in a year and a half, suggesting a long winter in digital collectibles ahead. Their sales volume fell to $823 million in the second quarter of 2025, down from $4 billion over the same period in 2024, according to a new report by DappRadar. That’s a 19% drop from the first quarter of this year and the fifth consecutive quarterly decline. This ongoing bust paints a bleak picture for digital collectible investors and creators. So far, 2025 is the worst year in NFT history, with no real recovery prospects. Nearly every part of the industry is reeling from the steep drop, from well-established collections such as Bored Ape Yacht Club to newer and smaller projects vying to prove their worth and utility. There are several reasons behind the decline, experts say. Interest has waned among the retail traders who, in recent months, flocked to digital collectibles in search of a quick buck. High gas fees on Ethereum, dwindling media buzz, and increasing skepticism about the long-term value of NFTs haven’t helped, either. In other words, fewer people buy, sell, or talk about digital collectibles. Hype fades as NFT platforms lose users NFTs came crashing into the mainstream in 2021 and 2022. They made millionaires overnight from artists and spawned a new generation of digital collectors. Landmark sales, most notably the Beeple auction at Christie’s , which took in $69 million, made headlines around the globe. In this golden age, trading volume in digital collectibles soared past $50 billion a year, and some crude cartoon images changed hands for more than $500,000 apiece. But the gold rush didn’t go on forever. But just as rapidly as NFTs ascended, they began to tumble. Prices began to tumble in mid-2022, erasing billions in value. Collections that once commanded high-profile attention now sell for a fraction of their peak prices. Numerous investors are now left clutching essentially worthless assets. The decline in traffic and trading activity has impacted even major NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, once the dominant platform for collectors. Others, including LooksRare and Blur, are dangling heavy incentives to keep users to little avail. Not even bands and celebrities that were once most aggressively promoting digital collectibles — from basketball players to internet stars — are making much noise. Many projects launched during the hype period are either dead or claimed to be scams. With buyer sentiment down, the mood around digital collectibles has turned to cautious optimism and even skepticism. Trump launches NFTs but fails to revive market And one of the last high-profile figures still pushing digital collectibles is the US president, Donald Trump. Since taking the political stage again, he has released four NFT collections, all dedicated to bold and sometimes humorous interpretations of himself, images of himself in superhero outfits, clutching gold bars, or even appearing to hug the cryptocurrency Bitcoin symbolically. Each of his prior releases has sold out within hours. Trump also held a special NFT holders ’ dinner in 2023 that attracted a lot of media coverage. The NFT drops have become part of his fundraising strategy, a mishmash of politics, pop culture, and crypto. But even Trump’s celebrity draw hasn’t reversed the broader tide. The Bitwise Blue-Chip NFT Collections Index, which measures the performance of top NFT art and collectible projects, has dropped 52% since January 2024, when Trump’s re-election campaign started to heat up. This tells us that though stock drops from new infections may cause an initial blip of interest, they don’t seem to move markets back sustainably. Meanwhile, other segments of the crypto space are proving more resilient. Meanwhile, Bitcoin and Ethereum rebounded in price in 2024 thanks to institutional investment and optimism around exchange-traded funds (ETFs). But NFTs have not benefited from that bounce.

2025-07-09T01:30:36,"ERC-20 Stablecoin Supply Hits All-Time High At $121B – Liquidity On The Rise","While Bitcoin struggles to break above its all-time high and altcoins face difficulty finding solid support, one corner of the crypto market continues to expand: stablecoins. Since the beginning of the bull run, the stablecoin market has shown consistent growth, cementing its reputation as one of crypto’s most reliable and scalable use cases. Unlike volatile assets, stablecoins offer stability, liquidity, and utility across DeFi, trading, and settlement. Related Reading: Ethereum Range Tightens – Liquidity Looms At $2,800 And $2,350 Top analyst Darkfost recently shared fresh data and highlighted a key development many have overlooked — the total supply of ERC-20 stablecoins is rising again. As of today, it has reached a new all-time high of $121 billion. This milestone signals renewed demand and liquidity entering the crypto ecosystem, at a time when other sectors appear stagnant. The rise in stablecoin supply underscores the sector’s resilience and importance. While speculative tokens face resistance, stablecoins thrive on utility and adoption. Whether for hedging, yield strategies, or capital movement, their role in crypto remains foundational. As the broader market waits for its next move, the silent growth in stablecoin supply could be an early signal of renewed momentum across the board. The stablecoin narrative is far from over — in fact, it may just be starting. Stablecoin Growth Accelerates: On-Chain Data Points To Renewed Liquidity Stablecoins have emerged as one of the most impactful innovations in crypto, creating a vital bridge between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). This narrative gained massive traction in June when Circle (NASDAQ: CRCL), the company behind USDC, went public on the New York Stock Exchange. Initially priced at $31 per share, Circle’s IPO exceeded all expectations — closing the day at $82.84, marking a 167% gain. Today, CRCL trades nearly six times above its IPO price, giving the company a $42 billion market cap and reinforcing confidence in the stablecoin business model. On-chain insights shared by Darkfost add another layer to the story. According to the data, the total supply of ERC-20 stablecoins has started rising again and just hit a new all-time high of $121 billion. ERC-20 stablecoins are cryptocurrencies built on the Ethereum blockchain that follow the ERC-20 token standard. They are designed to maintain a stable value, usually pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar (e.g., USDC, USDT, DAI). This surge in supply is critical because stablecoins are minted on demand — their issuance directly reflects user demand and fresh liquidity entering the system. This expanding supply meets the needs of protocols and exchanges that face rising user activity and capital inflows. While market sentiment remains cautious, if the stablecoin supply continues to grow, it would signal renewed risk appetite and capital deployment. In that case, stablecoins may once again serve as the early catalyst for the next major phase in the crypto bull cycle. Related Reading: Altcoins Set A Higher Low – Bulls Target 2024 High To Trigger Altseason Dominance Hovers Below 8%: A Neutral Yet Strategic Positioning The weekly chart shows stablecoin dominance currently sitting at 7.90%, a level that reflects cautious but sustained interest in liquidity reserves across the crypto market. After a sharp climb between 2020 and mid-2022—when stablecoin dominance peaked above 16% during risk-off periods—dominance has gradually declined, aligning with risk-on rotations into Bitcoin and altcoins during bull runs. However, since early 2024, dominance has consolidated between 7% and 10%, signaling a more balanced environment. The current level remains just above the 50-week and 100-week moving averages (7.76% and 8.02%, respectively), suggesting strong horizontal support. Meanwhile, the 200-week moving average at 9.30% acts as a long-term ceiling. Related Reading: Ethereum Risks Downside If Resistance Holds: $2,700 Level Is Critical This neutral position implies that market participants are neither fully risk-on nor risk-off. If dominance rises from here, it could either reflect increased fear (capital flowing out of volatile assets) or fresh liquidity entering the market, especially if paired with a rise in stablecoin supply, which we’re already witnessing with ERC-20 tokens.

2025-07-09T01:30:00,"ReserveOne adds crypto insiders and ex-Trump official to board","ReserveOne, a new crypto startup backed by big names from both traditional finance and Washington, plans to go public on the Nasdaq through a deal with M3-Brigade Acquisition V Corp, a blank-check firm listed under MBAV.O, according to Reuters. The merger is expected to close sometime between October and December this year, and the company is aiming to raise over $1 billion in the process. The company says it will manage a crypto portfolio that includes bitcoin, ethereum, and Solana, and plans to align its strategy with the U.S. strategic crypto reserve. The entire push is part of a broader effort to package crypto into equity to make it more appealing to institutional investors. The idea isn’t new. Michael Saylor’s company, MicroStrategy, did something similar in 2020 when it switched to a bitcoin-centered model and saw its stock price explode. ReserveOne is following that same model but throwing in more firepower from the top. ReserveOne adds crypto insiders and ex-Trump official to board Jaime Leverton, who previously ran crypto mining company Hut 8, is leading ReserveOne as CEO. Jaime said the firm’s upper-level team stands out because of its deep ties to finance, regulation, and crypto. “Our management team and anticipated board of directors bring a really unique pedigree and diversity of background between Wall Street and regulatory and crypto,” she told Reuters. Sebastian Bea, who previously held senior roles at BlackRock and Coinbase Asset Management, will take over as president and lead investment strategy. The board will be chaired by Reeve Collins, one of the co-founders of Tether, the largest stablecoin company. It’ll also include Chinh Chu, formerly at Blackstone, and Wilbur Ross, the former U.S. Secretary of Commerce under President Donald Trump. Jaime said Wilbur was skeptical of crypto at first but “over the last number of months, he’s really opened up to this space.” ReserveOne says it will not only hold crypto but also put it to work. The company plans to lend out assets and stake them to earn regular payouts. This institutional staking model is already common in crypto, but ReserveOne thinks doing it as a public company makes it more credible to larger investors. Backing this entire deal are two well-known crypto companies, Kraken and Blockchain.com, who are putting in up to $750 million in combined equity and convertible debt. The blank-check structure gives ReserveOne a shortcut to the public markets, skipping the longer traditional IPO route. Blank-check firms like M3-Brigade are shell companies that raise funds first and then look for a private firm to merge with. Once the deal is complete, the private company becomes publicly listed. That’s how ReserveOne is landing on the Nasdaq. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-07-09T01:29:25,"Asia Morning Briefing: Bitcoin Stalls Near $109K as Market Waits for a Catalyst","Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins its Wednesday trading day, bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade rangebound without any dominant market-moving headlines. The world's largest digital asset is trading above $108,900, according to CoinDesk market data , and the CoinDesk 20 index, a measure of the performance of the largest digital assets, is above 3,100, up 1.7%. Right now, what separates bitcoin's drift to $110K from a rally is market conviction, say observers. In a recent report, Glassnode highlighted that spot volumes for BTC continue to linger below their usual statistical bands, ETF flows contracted sharply from recent highs, and institutional investors appear hesitant despite the climbing unrealized gains shown in elevated ETF Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratios. In a market update from earlier this week, Wintermute describes this cautious environment as a ""barbell market,"" pointing out a stark divide between renewed enthusiasm in high-beta assets, like memecoins, and the stability of established large-cap tokens. Last year's narrative darlings, notably AI and DePIN tokens, have lost investor attention, indicating that traders are rotating into memecoins, many of the majors like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE are up over 8% in the last week, or staying in BTC and ETH, which are seen as battle-tested and secure. With global equities largely shrugging off geopolitical uncertainties, BTC's hesitancy underscores lingering caution among traders, suggesting the market awaits clearer signals before breaking decisively higher. Things are likely to remain rangebound until that changes. News Recap: $100M Fund Backs Builders, Not Bettors, on Bitcoin Bitcoin-only VC firm Ego Death Capital has closed a $100 million second fund aimed at backing projects that treat Bitcoin as infrastructure, not a speculative trade, CoinDesk previously reported . The fund will target Series A rounds between $3 million and $8 million for startups solving real-world problems using Bitcoin’s base layer or its scaling solutions. “We’re investing in businesses that treat Bitcoin not as a trade, but as infrastructure—something to build on, not bet on,” said general partner Lyn Alden. Ego’s existing portfolio includes Relai, a self-custody app, and Roxom, a securities exchange built directly on Bitcoin rails. At a time when multichain VCs are chasing yield on every new L2 and L3, Ego’s thesis is a bet on simplicity and durability: Bitcoin’s dominance remains above 60%, and the fund aims to capitalize on its staying power. The message to allocators: ignore the hype, back the rails that last. News Recap: Judge Bars Sanctions Talk in Tornado Cash Trial, Limits Free Speech Defense A federal judge has ruled that the U.S. government's sanctions against Tornado Cash, which were imposed in 2022 and later overturned, cannot be discussed in the upcoming criminal trial of developer Roman Storm, CoinDesk previously reported . Judge Katherine Polk Failla said allowing the jury to hear about the now-invalid sanctions would require ""mental gymnastics"" and risk confusing the core legal issues at trial. The sanctions were originally imposed by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) over alleged use of the mixer by North Korea’s Lazarus Group, but were struck down earlier this year in a separate case, Van Loon v. Treasury . Storm faces multiple criminal charges related to his role in building Tornado Cash, a privacy tool that allows users to obscure the origin of crypto transactions. Prosecutors allege that he profited substantially from the project, citing evidence of multi-million-dollar TORN token sales and real estate purchases. Judge Failla also ruled that evidence obtained from fellow Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev’s phone can be admitted at trial, despite objections from Storm’s legal team who argued the material was cherry-picked and not independently verifiable. Although Storm is free to speak about his belief in privacy and civil liberties, the judge said he will not be allowed to frame his actions as protected under the First Amendment. The court drew a distinction between personal beliefs and legal defenses. A final pre-trial hearing is scheduled for Friday, with the trial slated to begin on June 14 and expected to last four weeks. The outcome of the case is likely to set an important precedent for how U.S. courts treat developers of open-source privacy tools. Market Movements: BTC : Bitcoin maintained institutional-grade resilience during the July 7–8 trading cycle, holding above the key $108,000 level while navigating heavy resistance at $109,200 and finding strategic support near $107,470, signaling continued confidence from corporate treasuries despite late-session profit-taking, according to CoinDesk's market insights bot. ETH: Ethereum rose 3% to $2,610 during the July 7–8 session as institutional investors deployed $515 million in coordinated weekend buying, driving volumes to nearly triple the average and pushing the asset through key resistance levels Gold: Gold fell 1.2% to below $3,300 on Tuesday as optimism over delayed reciprocal tariffs and hopes for new trade deals weakened safe-haven demand, while markets awaited FOMC minutes for further rate guidance. Nikkei 225: Asian markets traded mixed Wednesday as Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged down 8.39 points (0.021%) after U.S. President Trump ruled out delaying August 1 tariffs, imposed a 50% duty on copper imports, and warned of potential 200% pharmaceutical tariffs with an 18-month grace period. S&P 500: The S&P 500 closed nearly unchanged on Tuesday after President Donald Trump confirmed there would be no exemptions to the August 1 tariff rollout.

2025-07-09T01:10:24,"U.S. Stock Market Trends: Unveiling a Cautious Close","BitcoinWorld U.S. Stock Market Trends: Unveiling a Cautious Close In the fast-paced world of finance, every flicker on the traditional stock market screen sends ripples across the entire investment landscape, including the volatile cryptocurrency sector. Recently, the U.S. stock market delivered a mixed performance, leaving investors pondering the immediate implications and future trajectory. While the numbers might seem small at first glance, these subtle shifts in the U.S. Stock Market Trends often signal deeper currents that can influence everything from tech giants to Bitcoin’s price action. U.S. Stock Market Trends: What Do the Mixed Signals Mean? The recent close saw the three major U.S. stock indexes diverging, a scenario that often reflects underlying uncertainties rather than a clear market direction. This mixed bag performance highlights a market grappling with various forces, where different sectors react distinctly to prevailing economic narratives. Understanding these U.S. Stock Market Trends is crucial for any investor, traditional or crypto-focused. S&P 500: -0.07% – This broad market index, representing 500 of the largest U.S. companies, experienced a slight dip, indicating a cautious stance among a wide range of investors. Nasdaq Composite: +0.07% – Heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks, Nasdaq’s marginal gain suggests resilience in the tech sector, perhaps driven by specific company news or continued enthusiasm for innovation. Dow Jones Industrial Average: -0.37% – Comprising 30 large, publicly owned companies, the Dow’s more pronounced decline points to headwinds faced by traditional industrial and financial sectors. This could be due to concerns over interest rates, inflation, or broader economic slowdowns affecting established businesses. Dissecting the Stock Market Performance: What Drove the Divergence? Why did these major indexes behave so differently? The nuanced Stock Market Performance can be attributed to several factors, underscoring the complexity of current market dynamics where a single narrative rarely dictates the entire market’s direction. Instead, it’s a tapestry woven from multiple threads of economic data and corporate actions, directly influencing overall Stock Market Performance . Sectoral Rotation: Investors might be shifting capital between different sectors. For instance, defensive sectors (utilities, consumer staples) might see inflows during uncertain times, while cyclical sectors (industrials, financials) could face pressure. Company-Specific News: Earnings reports, product launches, or regulatory announcements from influential companies within each index can sway their overall direction. A strong earnings report from a tech giant on Nasdaq could offset declines elsewhere. Interest Rate Expectations: Speculation around the Federal Reserve’s next move on interest rates significantly impacts growth stocks (Nasdaq) more than value stocks (often found in Dow/S&P). Higher rates make future earnings less attractive, especially for companies relying on cheap capital. Inflation Concerns: Persistent inflation can erode corporate profits and consumer purchasing power, impacting the broader market. Different sectors have varying abilities to pass on increased costs to consumers. Global Economic Outlook: How Does it Influence Market Movements? Beyond immediate market reactions, the broader Global Economic Outlook plays a pivotal role in shaping investor confidence and asset prices. These macroeconomic headwinds and tailwinds create a complex environment that filters down to individual company performance and, consequently, the major stock indexes. A cautious Global Economic Outlook often translates into a more volatile and uncertain market. Inflationary Pressures: Central banks worldwide are battling inflation, leading to aggressive interest rate hikes. This impacts borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, potentially slowing economic growth. Geopolitical Tensions: Conflicts and political instability in various regions can disrupt supply chains, increase commodity prices, and create uncertainty, pushing investors towards safer assets or causing broad market sell-offs. Supply Chain Disruptions: Lingering issues from the pandemic and recent geopolitical events continue to affect the production and distribution of goods, leading to higher costs and reduced corporate profitability. Energy Prices: Fluctuations in oil and gas prices can significantly impact transportation costs, manufacturing, and consumer spending, directly influencing corporate earnings and economic stability. Decoding Market Sentiment: What’s Driving Investor Psychology? While economic data and corporate earnings provide the fundamental backbone, Market Sentiment acts as the invisible hand, often dictating short-term price movements. The mixed close we observed is a direct reflection of conflicting sentiments among investors. Understanding and anticipating shifts in Market Sentiment is as crucial as analyzing balance sheets, especially in today’s interconnected financial world where emotions can amplify market swings. Cautious Optimism: Some investors might see opportunities in specific sectors or believe that inflation is peaking, leading to small gains in certain areas. Fear of Recession: Others might be pulling back, fearing an impending economic downturn, which leads to declines in more vulnerable sectors. Uncertainty and Indecision: The slight movements indicate that a significant portion of the market is in a ‘wait-and-see’ mode, lacking conviction for a strong directional move. This indecision often leads to choppy, range-bound trading. The Role of News Cycles: Daily headlines, from inflation reports to central bank speeches, can dramatically shift sentiment, creating knee-jerk reactions that may not always align with long-term fundamentals. Cryptocurrency Market Impact: How Do Stock Ripples Affect Crypto? Given the increasing correlation between traditional markets and digital assets, the performance of the U.S. Stock Market Trends invariably sends ripples into the cryptocurrency space. While crypto markets often march to their own beat, they are not entirely immune to the macroeconomic forces influencing stocks. The mixed close in the stock market serves as a reminder that even for crypto enthusiasts, keeping an eye on traditional financial indicators is essential. The interconnectedness means that significant shifts in the Cryptocurrency Market Impact can often be traced back to broader economic and financial market trends. Bitcoin’s Role as a Bellwether: Bitcoin, often seen as ‘digital gold’ by some and a ‘risk-on’ asset by others, frequently mirrors the movements of risk assets like tech stocks. A cautious stock market can lead to consolidation or minor pullbacks in Bitcoin, influencing the broader crypto market. Altcoin Volatility: Altcoins, generally more volatile than Bitcoin, tend to amplify the movements seen in Bitcoin. If Bitcoin reacts negatively to stock market weakness, altcoins can experience more significant declines. Liquidity Flows: When traditional markets face uncertainty, institutional and retail investors might reallocate capital, potentially drawing liquidity away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies or, conversely, seeking them as a hedge if they view them as non-correlated (though this view is currently less prevalent). Regulatory Environment: While not directly tied to daily stock movements, the overall regulatory climate for both traditional finance and crypto is influenced by the prevailing economic outlook. A tightening financial environment can lead to increased scrutiny on nascent industries like crypto. Challenges and Opportunities for Investors This mixed market signal presents both challenges and opportunities. The challenge lies in navigating the uncertainty and avoiding impulsive decisions based on short-term fluctuations. However, it also creates opportunities for strategic positioning: For Stock Investors: It might be a time to re-evaluate portfolios, focusing on quality companies with strong fundamentals that can weather economic headwinds. Diversification across sectors and asset classes becomes even more critical. For Crypto Investors: This period could be an opportune time for dollar-cost averaging into preferred assets or exploring projects with strong utility and long-term vision, rather than chasing speculative gains. Understanding the broader economic context helps in making informed decisions about your potential Cryptocurrency Market Impact . Actionable Insights for Navigating a Mixed Market How can you make sense of these complex signals and position yourself effectively? Stay Informed: Continuously monitor both traditional financial news and crypto-specific developments. Knowledge is your strongest defense against volatility. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio, including a mix of traditional assets and cryptocurrencies, can help mitigate risks. Define Your Risk Tolerance: Understand how much risk you’re comfortable taking and adjust your investment strategy accordingly. This is particularly important when considering the potential Cryptocurrency Market Impact from traditional market movements. Long-Term Perspective: While daily fluctuations grab headlines, successful investing often hinges on a long-term view. Focus on the fundamentals and the potential for future growth rather than short-term noise. Consider Professional Advice: For complex financial decisions, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your goals. Summary: What Does a Mixed Close Truly Mean? The recent mixed close of the U.S. stock markets – with the S&P 500 and Dow dipping while Nasdaq held steady – is more than just a set of numbers. It’s a clear indicator of a market wrestling with conflicting forces, from inflation concerns to technological resilience. This nuanced Stock Market Performance reflects broader shifts in the Global Economic Outlook and directly influences Market Sentiment . For those in the digital asset space, understanding these U.S. Stock Market Trends is paramount, as the Cryptocurrency Market Impact is increasingly evident. In an era of interconnected finance, vigilance, diversification, and a long-term perspective remain the cornerstones of navigating these complex waters.

2025-07-09T01:00:03,"Bitcoin Miners Quiet Down—Volume Hits Lowest Since 2022","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin miners have seen a drop in activity as their transaction volume share has declined to multi-year lows. Bitcoin Miner Volume Is Now At Its Lowest Since November 2022 According to data from the institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock), the Bitcoin Miners’ Volume Share has recently gone down. This on-chain indicator measures, as its name suggests, the percentage of the BTC transaction volume that the miner-related transfers occupy. Below is the chart shared by Sentora that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Miners’ Volume Share over the past decade: As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin Miners’ Volume Share remained at a high level last year, indicating that the miners were participating in a notable amount of activity. On a few occasions, the indicator even crossed or hit the 20% mark, meaning that these chain validators contributed to one-fifth of the total network volume. This year, the metric has witnessed a significant fall-off, and the decline has only deepened recently, with its value dropping to a low of just 3.3%. From the chart, it’s visible that this is the lowest that the indicator has been since November 2022, when the bear market reached its bottom. Generally, miners transfer coins when they want to participate in selling, so their activity being low can suggest that they don’t have much appetite for selling. It only remains to be seen, though, what effect this has on the Bitcoin price, if any. In some other news, as Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards has pointed out in an X post , the recent Digital Mining Industry Report from Cambridge has revealed that 75% of all reported mining activity now occurs in the US. Just four years back, 50% of all mining took place in China, but the ban in the country meant that miners had to take operations elsewhere. “Bitcoin is officially now ‘Made in America,'” notes Edwards. The report has also reconfirmed the average miner electricity cost: $45/MWh. According to the analyst, Capriole’s BTC Production Cost model had been using this same figure for years. This electricity cost represents 80% of the expense that these chain validators incur to run their operations. “Bitcoin Production Cost is one of the highest value indicators for sniping incredible Bitcoin buying opportunities, so it’s great to have these critical data points re-validated and accurate for 2025,” says Edwards. BTC Price Bitcoin continues to move sideways as its price is still trading around the $108,800 mark.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-miners-quiet-down-volume-hits-lowest-2022/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Miner Volume|Bitcoin Miners|bitcoin mining|btc|BTCUSDT",cryptocompare

2025-07-09T00:50:31,"Trump Demands Urgent Interest Rate Cuts from Jerome Powell","BitcoinWorld Trump Demands Urgent Interest Rate Cuts from Jerome Powell The financial world is abuzz once again as former U.S. President Donald Trump has taken to his platform, Truth Social, to express a familiar and fervent demand: immediate interest rate cuts from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell . This latest call, highlighted by the Walter Bloomberg economic news account on X, reignites a long-standing debate about the independence of the central bank and the direction of U.S. economic policy . For those navigating the volatile waters of cryptocurrency, understanding these macroeconomic pressures is crucial, as Fed decisions often ripple across all asset classes, including digital currencies. Why is Trump Pushing for Rate Cuts from the Trump Fed ? Donald Trump’s consistent advocacy for lower interest rates stems from a belief that such a move would stimulate economic growth, boost the stock market, and make borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers. His latest comments on Truth Social underscore a recurring theme from his presidency: a desire for the Federal Reserve to adopt a more accommodative monetary stance. During his time in office, Trump frequently criticized Powell for not cutting rates aggressively enough, arguing that higher rates were hindering the U.S. economy’s full potential. The argument for rate cuts often centers on several key points: Stimulating Growth: Lower interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing for businesses, encouraging investment, expansion, and job creation. For consumers, it means cheaper mortgages and loan payments, potentially boosting spending. Combating Deflationary Pressures: In an environment where prices are falling or stagnating, rate cuts can help prevent deflation, which can be detrimental to an economy. Weakening the Dollar: Lower rates can make a country’s currency less attractive to foreign investors, potentially leading to a weaker dollar. This can make exports cheaper and more competitive, benefiting domestic industries. Market Boost: Historically, lower rates have often been associated with rising stock markets, as companies’ borrowing costs decrease and future earnings become more valuable. The Federal Reserve’s Independent Stance and Jerome Powell ‘s Dilemma At the heart of this discussion is the Federal Reserve’s role as an independent central bank. The Fed operates with a dual mandate from Congress: to achieve maximum employment and maintain price stability (low and stable inflation). This independence is designed to insulate monetary policy decisions from short-term political pressures, allowing the Fed to make choices based on economic data and long-term stability goals. Jerome Powell , as the current Chairman, has repeatedly emphasized the Fed’s commitment to its dual mandate and its data-dependent approach. His decisions are not made in isolation but are the result of deliberations by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which assesses a wide range of economic indicators, including: Inflation rates (Consumer Price Index, Personal Consumption Expenditures) Employment data (unemployment rate, job growth, wage growth) GDP growth Consumer spending and business investment Global economic conditions The challenge for Powell and the Fed is balancing the desire for economic growth with the need to control inflation. Cutting rates too soon or too aggressively could reignite inflationary pressures, eroding purchasing power and creating economic instability. Conversely, holding rates too high for too long could stifle economic activity and lead to a recession. The Ripple Effect: How Interest Rate Cuts Impact Markets, Including Crypto Monetary policy decisions by the Federal Reserve have profound effects across all financial markets. When the Fed signals or implements interest rate cuts , several dynamics come into play: Market Type Potential Impact of Rate Cuts Explanation Traditional Stocks (Equities) Generally Positive Lower borrowing costs for companies, higher corporate profits, and increased investor appetite for riskier assets over bonds. Bonds (Fixed Income) Yields Fall, Prices Rise Existing bonds with higher yields become more attractive. New bonds will be issued at lower yields. Real Estate Generally Positive Lower mortgage rates make homeownership more affordable, boosting demand and property values. Commodities (e.g., Gold) Mixed, Often Positive A weaker dollar (often a result of lower rates) makes dollar-denominated commodities cheaper for foreign buyers. Gold can also act as an inflation hedge if rate cuts lead to inflation. Cryptocurrencies Often Positive (Risk-On) Lower interest rates can reduce the attractiveness of traditional safe-haven assets and yield-bearing instruments, pushing investors towards higher-risk, higher-reward assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. Increased liquidity in the system can also flow into crypto. For the crypto market, a ‘risk-on’ environment, often fostered by lower rates and abundant liquidity, tends to be beneficial. When traditional investments offer lower returns, the allure of potentially higher gains in digital assets increases. Conversely, a ‘risk-off’ environment, driven by high rates or economic uncertainty, can lead investors to pull funds from speculative assets like crypto. The Broader Implications of Trump’s Stance on Economic Policy Trump’s repeated public demands on the Fed highlight a fundamental tension between political leadership and central bank independence. While politicians often prefer policies that can stimulate short-term growth and appease voters, central bankers are tasked with maintaining long-term economic stability, which sometimes requires unpopular decisions. The former President’s use of Truth Social as a direct communication channel amplifies his message, ensuring it reaches a wide audience and keeps the pressure on policymakers. This dynamic creates uncertainty for markets. Investors constantly weigh the potential for political influence on monetary policy against the Fed’s stated commitment to independence. Any perceived shift in the Fed’s stance due to external pressure could lead to market volatility, as participants adjust their expectations for future interest rate decisions. What to Watch For: Navigating Future Fed Decisions As the debate around interest rates continues, market participants, including crypto investors, should pay close attention to several key indicators and announcements: FOMC Meetings: The Federal Open Market Committee meets eight times a year to discuss and set monetary policy. The statements and press conferences following these meetings provide crucial insights into the Fed’s outlook. Inflation Data: Key inflation reports like the CPI (Consumer Price Index) and PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) are primary drivers of Fed decisions. Sustained declines in inflation could pave the way for cuts. Employment Reports: The monthly jobs report (Non-Farm Payrolls, unemployment rate) offers a snapshot of the labor market, a key component of the Fed’s dual mandate. Speeches by Fed Officials: Public comments from Jerome Powell and other Fed governors can offer hints about future policy direction. Understanding these signals can help investors anticipate potential shifts in the macroeconomic landscape and position their portfolios accordingly, whether in traditional assets or the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. Conclusion: The Enduring Battle Over Interest Rates Donald Trump’s latest call for interest rate cuts from Jerome Powell via Truth Social is more than just a political statement; it’s a stark reminder of the ongoing tension between political aspirations and the independent mandate of the Federal Reserve. While Trump advocates for policies he believes will accelerate economic growth, the Fed remains committed to balancing employment and price stability through its carefully considered economic policy . For investors, particularly those in the crypto space, these macroeconomic currents are vital. The Fed’s decisions on rates directly influence liquidity, risk appetite, and the broader financial environment, shaping the trajectory of digital assets. As this high-stakes economic dialogue continues, staying informed about the Fed’s actions and the rationale behind them will be paramount for navigating the markets successfully.

2025-07-09T00:00:50,"Altcoins Reclaim Trendline That Led To 2021 Explosion, Will History Repeat Itself?","The altcoin market is flashing a familiar signal that preceded its most explosive rallies in the past. After months of uncertainty and price consolidation, a new analysis suggests that altcoins have just reclaimed a critical trendline—the same one that marked the beginning of the 2017 and 2021 bull runs. With market patterns aligning and fractals emerging, analysts are now questioning whether the conditions are once again ripe for a massive altcoin breakout. Altcoins Eye Vertical Move As Bear Trap Ends The altcoin market may be on the brink of a historic breakout, according to a recent chart analysis by crypto expert Merlijn The Trader. The analyst draws parallels between the current cycle and those of 2017 and 2021. The analyst’s chart, published on X social media, shows that the total altcoin market capitalization has reclaimed a long-term ascending trendline that had preceded previous vertical expansions during major bull runs. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Not Remotely Close, Bitcoin Dominance Still Too High: Market Expert Says In earlier cycles, altcoins briefly broke this trendline in what was identified as a “bear trap” before swiftly reversing and launching into explosive growth phases. Merlijin The Trader reveals that this pattern appears to be repeating in this cycle, as the current market structure mirrors previous setups that triggered rapid valuation increases across the altcoin sector. The ascending trendline recovery is framed within a red box in the chart, consistent with the zones that marked the end of prior downtrends. In each instance, the reclaim was followed by aggressive upward movement, highlighted by green boxes that represented parabolic gains in the total market cap. Merlijn The Trader suggests that the recent rebound indicates the completion of another bear trap, signaling renewed bullish momentum. Green arrows placed below the price curve, matching the timing of previous breakouts within the analyst’s chart, imply that the altcoin market could be preparing for another phase of expansion. If the historical fractal holds, the analyst forecasts a sharp vertical rally for altcoins, with valuations possibly reaching the $10-$16 trillion range. Altcoin Market Mirror 2016-2018 Breakout Setup In another fresh analysis, Merlijn The Trader noted that the altcoin market cap is showing signs of repeating a historical pattern that previously led to a major bull rally. A comparison between the 2016-2018 market cycle and the current one reveals an almost identical structure playing out, albeit on a much larger scale. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Holds Altcoin Season At Bay, Analyst Says No Upside Until This Happens The market appears to have formed a Double Bottom, followed by a mid-cycle correction and consolidation within a descending broadening wedge pattern. This same fractal unfolded before the explosive altcoin rally in 2017. The analyst’s chart also illustrates that in the previous cycle, altcoins broke out of this same wedge pattern, resulting in a massive surge in market capitalization, which he referred to as “Pump 2.0”. With the same breakout now confirmed for this cycle’s market structure, Merlijn The Trader predicts that the altcoin sector may be entering its next parabolic expansion phase. This development could mark the end of the altcoin market’s current bear phase and the beginning of a second macro pump similar to what occurred between 2017 and early 2018.

2025-07-09T00:00:36,"Spending Your Bitcoin (BTC) May Not Be ‘Sustainable Practice,’ According to Macro Guru Lyn Alden – Here’s Why","Popular macroeconomics expert Lyn Alden isn’t sold on Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) functionality as a medium of exchange yet. Alden explains in a new analysis that people with specific payment issues like capital controls and payment de-platforming find BTC useful, but they can often also use less-volatile stablecoins as short-term solutions to those same problems. “There are some very well-meaning Bitcoin proponents trying to convince Bitcoin holders to spend it more. I don’t particularly view that as a sustainable practice. Bitcoin is not going to catch on as a charity. In order for spending it to catch on persistently at scale (i.e. not just billions of dollar-equivalents in annual global medium-of-exchange volume, but trillions), it has to solve problems for spenders and/or recipients that other solutions are not doing. And at this stage of adoption, that’s not necessarily the case, especially with capital gains taxes applicable to every single transaction and with options like stablecoins for near-term spending needs where volatility needs to be low.” Alden says Bitcoin instead has value due to its “optionality.” “Owning a sound, liquid, fungible, portable store of value that is going through its adoption phase gives the owner some perks, or options, that other assets do not. Mainly, they can bring their store of value wherever they want in the world without relying on central counterparties and credit. It also allows them to make crossborder payments, including to deplatformed recipients, through substantial friction even if they are staying put where they are. They might not be able to ubiquitously pay with it, but if need be they can find ways to convert it to local currency in most environments that they find themselves in, and in some cases can indeed pay with it directly.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-09T00:00:19,"Revealed: Mysterious XRPL Co-Founder Who Owns 2% of All XRP","A prominent XRP analyst known as “All Things XRP” recently drew attention to Arthur Britto, one of the original architects of the XRP Ledger, emphasizing the significant yet little-known role he continues to play in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. A Founding Architect of XRP Ledger Arthur Britto was instrumental in the creation of Ripple Labs in 2012, alongside David Schwartz, Chris Larsen, and Jed McCaleb. In collaboration with his co-founders, Britto helped establish the XRP Ledger “as a next-generation payment solution for scalability and transaction efficiency,” according to crypto historians. His technical expertise shaped XRP into one of the most prominent digital assets by market capitalization. Despite these contributions, Britto has intentionally kept a low profile. Unlike Schwartz and McCaleb, who have participated in interviews and public forums, Britto has avoided media exposure and rarely communicates publicly. HE CO-CREATED THE XRP LEDGER. HE HOLDS 2% OF ALL XRP. HE’S NEVER BEEN SEEN IN PUBLIC. Arthur Britto might be the most important figure in crypto you’ve never heard of. Let’s dive into the mystery. pic.twitter.com/xKyiYXIpGY — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) July 5, 2025 His influence extends beyond his engineering contributions. A contractual arrangement from 2012 granted him ownership of approximately 2% of all XRP tokens. This sizable holding underscores both his foundational role in the project and his long-term commitment to XRP’s development. Comparisons to Satoshi Nakamoto Britto’s extreme privacy has fueled speculation and intrigue within the community. Some observers have drawn parallels to Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto . The coincidence that Britto’s last public interaction occurred during the initial XRP Ledger launch has added fuel to these theories. However, there is no credible indication that Britto is Nakamoto, and this notion remains speculative. In June 2025, Britto broke his decade-long silence by posting a single emoji on X. That post was confirmed by Ripple CTO David Schwartz, highlighting its authenticity. Although the meaning behind the emoji remains unclear, it generated speculation that it may indicate forthcoming developments within the ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ongoing Influence Through Blockchain Technology Although Britto maintains a low public presence, his engagement with blockchain technology continues. He is a co-founder of PolySign, a company focused on secure digital asset custody. PolySign evolved into Standard Custody & Trust Company and was subsequently integrated into Ripple’s custody services. These developments suggest that Britto’s influence extends beyond XRP Ledger protocol design and into institutional infrastructure for digital assets. Within XRP communities, rumors have circulated that Britto has predicted XRP could ultimately reach $10,000 per token. While intriguing, there is no confirmed statement or credible source supporting this claim. Although Arthur Britto rarely seeks attention, his technical contributions and token ownership establish him as a key contributor to Ripple’s foundation. He continues to drive blockchain innovation quietly, both through XRPL and institutional-grade custody services. While the full extent of his role remains undisclosed, analysts agree that Britto’s work continues to influence the strategic trajectory of XRP and Ripple.

2025-07-08T23:30:16,"Crypto Proponent Says XRP Must Hit This Level First Before Targeting $36","Crypto commentator Nathaniel Rothschild has renewed debate around XRP’s long-term valuation by suggesting that a $36 price point, while ambitious, is within the realm of possibility. In a recent post on X, Rothschild stated that the digital asset must first break through specific benchmarks, namely $7 and $13 before any serious momentum toward the $36 level can be expected. Rothschild’s projection has reignited long-standing discussions about XRP’s growth potential. Critics often push back on high price targets, citing the substantial increase required for such outcomes. At its current trading price near $2.27, XRP would need to rally over 1,500% to reach $36. If XRP were to reach that level, its market capitalization would exceed $2.1 trillion, similar to Bitcoin’s current valuation. Such a scenario would position XRP above major global assets like silver and corporations, including Facebook and Saudi Aramco. Skeptics argue that achieving this valuation in the short term is unlikely due to broader market limitations and regulatory uncertainty. 36$ for XRP is not unrealistic, but first 7-13$ — Nathaniel C. J. Rothschild (@NCJRothschild) July 5, 2025 Timeline Estimates from Analysts Various forecasting models offer different timelines for XRP potentially reaching or approaching the $36 threshold. Research published by Telegaon projects that this price may be achievable by the year 2030, assuming favorable market conditions and adoption trends. Bitwise, in a separate analysis targeted at institutional investors, proposed a slightly lower target of $29 by 2030 in an ultra-bullish scenario. Their more conservative short-term outlook sees XRP potentially hitting $6.53 under optimal conditions in 2025 or 2026 but also considers the possibility of a price retracement to around $1.07. Changelly, another market research platform, adopts an even longer horizon, estimating that XRP could reach $36 sometime in 2032. These projections vary based on the assumptions behind each model, including market adoption, institutional investment, and technological developments within the XRP Ledger ecosystem. Views from Independent Analysts Despite the conservative nature of institutional forecasts, independent market watchers maintain a more optimistic stance. Analyst Dustin Layton recently predicted that XRP could reach at least $50 before the end of this year, challenging the broader crypto community to reexamine their expectations. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Similarly, EGRAG Crypto, known for his historical pattern-based analysis, suggested that XRP could experience a price surge of up to 2,000%, bringing the token above $37 if its previous market cycles repeat. However, he also acknowledged that a more moderate scenario could see XRP peak around $9 if momentum falls short. Community Reactions Remain Divided Rothschild’s comments sparked a mixed response from the online XRP community. Some users expressed enthusiasm, arguing that in the world of cryptocurrency, such targets are attainable over time. One commenter described $36 as cheap, implying that even higher valuations could be possible. On the other hand, some urged caution , stressing the need to focus on nearer-term targets and arguing that projections of major price increases should be based on present market performance. While opinions differ widely on whether XRP can realistically attain a $36 price point, consensus exists around the need for the asset to achieve interim price milestones first.

2025-07-08T23:00:33,"Ethereum Turns Key Resistance Into Support – Momentum Builds For Range Breakout","Ethereum is consolidating above the $2,500 mark, showing resilience amid broader market uncertainty. While bulls have successfully flipped $2,500 from resistance into support, the price still faces significant pressure below the $2,700 zone. This range-bound behavior has persisted since early May, and the coming days are likely to define the next major move, not only for ETH but also for the broader altcoin market. Related Reading: Ethereum Range Tightens – Liquidity Looms At $2,800 And $2,350 Top analyst Ted Pillows shared technical insights, highlighting Ethereum’s current structure, particularly after the $2,500 level was reclaimed. However, the next challenge lies in reclaiming the range high. A breakout above this key resistance could trigger a strong bullish continuation and potentially ignite an altseason, as capital often rotates into altcoins once ETH gains momentum. On the flip side, failure to sustain current support may open the door for a pullback toward lower demand levels. For now, bulls appear to be in control, but the market remains on edge, awaiting a decisive move. Whether ETH can build enough strength to break through resistance or slips into another leg of consolidation will likely shape sentiment and positioning for the weeks ahead. Ethereum Builds Strength As It Eyes Range High Ethereum continues to trade within a well-defined consolidation zone, oscillating between $2,400 and $2,700 since early May. After reclaiming the $2,500 level and flipping it into support, ETH now looks poised for a potential breakout. Ted Pillows highlighted this shift in momentum, stating that Ethereum is “looking good” and could soon revisit the upper boundary of the range. However, despite Ethereum’s strength, broader market conditions remain mixed. Bitcoin’s failure to break above its all-time high adds pressure to the crypto market, and altcoins continue to struggle to find solid footing. While macroeconomic uncertainty has eased following encouraging job reports and legislative developments in the US, headwinds persist. Rising US Treasury yields and the Federal Reserve’s ongoing delay in cutting interest rates contribute to a cautious environment. Still, Ethereum’s ability to hold above $2,500 suggests bullish intent. If price pushes toward and ultimately breaks above $2,700, it could trigger a broader move across altcoins, reawakening market momentum. But without a breakout in the short term, another leg of consolidation—or even a pullback—remains possible. This week may prove pivotal in setting the tone for Ethereum and the altcoin market’s next phase. Related Reading: Ethereum Risks Downside If Resistance Holds: $2,700 Level Is Critical ETH Tests Resistance As Consolidation Tightens Ethereum is trading at $2,550, holding above its key moving averages and continuing to consolidate in a tight range. The daily chart shows that ETH is attempting to break above the 200-day moving average (red), currently sitting near $2,488, while managing to stay above both the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages. This convergence of key technical levels highlights the current equilibrium between bulls and bears. Despite multiple attempts since early May, Ethereum has not been able to sustain a breakout above the $2,700 mark. Each push higher has faced selling pressure, suggesting that this zone remains a major area of resistance. However, recent price action shows higher lows and strong defense of the $2,500 level, signaling building momentum. Related Reading: Altcoins Set A Higher Low – Bulls Target 2024 High To Trigger Altseason Trading volume remains relatively flat, which aligns with the ongoing consolidation, but could also foreshadow a volatility spike once direction is confirmed. A successful daily close above the $2,600–$2,700 zone could trigger an impulsive move toward $3,000 and beyond. Conversely, a breakdown below the $2,480 level would invalidate the bullish structure and shift sentiment.

2025-07-08T22:01:21,"Metaplanet CEO Predicts ‘Bitcoin Gold Rush,’ Says Company Wants To Accumulate Enough BTC To Reach ‘Escape Velocity’: Report","The CEO of Bitcoin hoarder Metaplanet says the company is looking to accumulate so much BTC that it will become impossible for others to catch up in the future. Speaking to the Financial Times , Simon Gerovich says the firm is taking advantage of Bitcoin’s “gold rush” moment by plotting a long-term strategy to build one of the world’s largest BTC treasuries before pivoting into other investment opportunities. Says Gerovich, “We think of it as a Bitcoin gold rush… We need to accumulate as much bitcoin as we can to get to a point where we’ve reached escape velocity, and it just makes it very difficult for others to catch up. Then we have phase two, when Bitcoin, like securities or government bonds, can be deposited with banks and then they’ll provide very attractive financing against that asset. We’ll get cash that we can use to buy profitable businesses, cash-flowing businesses.” Metaplanet previously announced that its goal was to own at least 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. The company’s BTC holdings recently surpassed Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the world, which has been in operation since Bitcoin was below $30. According to BitcoinTreasuries.net, Metaplanet holds 15,555 BTC, making it the fifth-biggest Bitcoin treasury in the world. Hitting the 210,000 mark would make it the second biggest in the world, just behind Michael Saylor’s Strategy. Gerovich says the company is still in the “really, really early” stages of its plan, which he says could transition to a strategy that uses Bitcoin as collateral to borrow and buy cash-flowing assets like profitable businesses. “Four to six years is probably phase one in this Bitcoin accumulation phase, and then beyond that it becomes incrementally more difficult.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-08T22:00:45,"Ethereum ETF Inflows Hit 8-Week Streak—Institutions Still Buying","Data shows the US Ethereum spot ETFs have seen net inflows for eight consecutive weeks now, a sign of continued institutional demand. Ethereum Spot ETF Netflow Remains Positive In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has shared an update on how the weekly netflow for the US spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) of Ethereum has been looking. Spot ETFs refer to investment vehicles that allow investors to gain exposure to an asset without having to directly own it. These ETFs trade on the traditional platforms, so they allow for an easier investment method for those who find cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets overwhelming to navigate. Related Reading: Dogecoin Resistance Walls Ahead: Analyst Flags 3 Key Levels Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows how the American Ethereum spot ETFs have been doing lately: From the graph, it’s visible that the netflow related to the Ethereum spot ETFs has recently been on a green streak. This means that inflows into wallets attached to the ETFs are continuously happening. Last week saw a net inflow of 61,000 ETH, worth $157.3 million at the current exchange rate. With these inflows, the spot ETFs of the cryptocurrency have seen positive values for eight straight weeks. Since institutional investors generally take this investment route into Ethereum, the continuous inflows could be a sign of sustained demand from them. Despite this interest, the ETH price has remained locked in a phase of sideways movement. Ethereum isn’t the only asset that’s observing demand on the ETFs. As the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has pointed out in an X post, Bitcoin has also been enjoying net inflows. As displayed in the above chart, the Bitcoin ETFs have seen a positive netflow on 16 out of the last 17 trading days. The one exception was on July 1st, when outflows occurred. In some other news, Ethereum has observed new on-chain capital inflows during the past week, as Glassnode has revealed in another X post. In the graph, the data for the Realized Cap of coins aged less than 1 week is shown for Ethereum and Solana. The “Realized Cap” measures the amount of capital that the investors have put into a given network. The version of the metric of focus here specifically calculates the capital that has come in over the past week. Related Reading: Bitcoin In For Another 460% Run? This Rare Fiat Signal Just Returned From the chart, it’s visible that the metric has seen an increase for both ETH and SOL during the past week, indicating fresh capital has flowed in. The latter has outperformed the former, however, with the metric standing at $6.2 billion and $8.3 billion, respectively. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is floating around $2,580, up over 5% in the last week.

2025-07-08T22:00:06,"BlockDAG Rockets Past $332M in Presale As BTC Bull Eyes $8M Finish!","The excitement in the meme coin space is rising again, and BTC Bull is at the center of it. The presale is about to cross $8M, and its official launch date is set for July 7. Many compare BTC Bull to coins like Pepecoin and DOGE, and some expect it could rise 50x after launch. The plan for BTC Bull is simple. It uses Bitcoin branding mixed with a strong community focus to catch attention fast and try to grow quickly. However, not all projects rely only on buzz. BlockDAG has already gathered $332M from 29 presale batches. Its tools are live, and its user and developer communities are growing steadily. From a tap-to-mine app that welcomes new users daily to developer stacks that already support smart contracts, BlockDAG (BDAG) is not waiting for launch to prove itself. The project is already active and building real value. BTC Bull Ready For July 7 Launch With $8M Presale BTC Bull is gaining attention, with its presale now nearing $8M as it moves towards launch. The official listing is confirmed for July 7, and the coin will be available on several exchanges as soon as it goes live. Early estimates from market watchers suggest that BTC Bull could see up to 50x growth. This is being driven by strong activity on social platforms and a solid marketing effort. The project’s team announced the launch date while pointing out how BTC Bull could follow the path of other meme coins like PEPE and SHIB. BTC Bull aims to use Bitcoin’s name appeal along with viral marketing to build its reach. The presale has grown through different stages, with prices rising as more people join in. While the hype is loud, there are still questions about long-term plans. BTC Bull is focused on timing and momentum for now. That might bring success early on, but it leaves some wondering what will happen after the coin goes live. $332M Raised as BlockDAG Nears GLOBAL LAUNCH BlockDAG has successfully raised $332M so far across 29 presale batches. The price in batch 29 is currently set at $0.0276. Those who entered the presale during batch 1 have already achieved returns of 2,660% based on the current batch price. This shows just how much the project has progressed over time. As part of the GLOBAL LAUNCH release, there is now a special opportunity for buyers. The price has been unlocked at $0.0016 for all purchases until August 11. This gives participants a rare chance to buy at one of the lowest price points. This move is drawing even more interest as people see the potential gains. One of the standout features helping BlockDAG gain traction is the X1 mining app. This app makes it easy for anyone with a phone to join the mining process. By simply tapping the screen, users can mine coins and earn daily rewards. The app also makes it simple to connect to the presale. This user-friendly approach has led to hundreds of thousands of downloads, helping BlockDAG build a strong and growing network. On the technical side, BlockDAG offers no-code development tools and pre-built smart contract stacks. These stacks support programming languages like Solidity, Python, and Vyper. This makes it simple for developers to get started without needing to build systems from scratch. The community is growing steadily, with active members on platforms such as Telegram and Discord, as each batch continues to unlock new progress. BlockDAG vs. BTC Bull: A Detailed Comparison Not every project built on hype can keep going in the long term. Here is a side-by-side view of BTC Bull and BlockDAG, showing how they compare beyond the buzz. While BTC Bull is dependent on quick attention and viral interest, BlockDAG is showing real progress with strong fundamentals. Presale Progress BTC Bull is close to $8M raised as it nears the end of its presale. BlockDAG has collected over $332M across 29 batches with a 2,660% return since batch 1. Technology And Features BTC Bull has no live technology, no testnet, and few details about its planned features. BlockDAG provides no-code tools, supports many programming languages, and offers ready-made contract stacks. Community And Growth BTC Bull’s following is driven mainly by meme appeal, marketing, and timing. BlockDAG’s community keeps growing alongside its new features and tools, with active user and developer groups. BTC Bull might see a quick rise after launch. BlockDAG is already laying the groundwork for steady, long-term growth. Summing Up! BTC Bull is building excitement with an $8M presale, a set launch date, and bold claims for July 7. The project could see fast gains, especially from those looking for the next meme coin to take off. On the other hand, BlockDAG has gone beyond just making noise. It has a working testnet, tools already live, and a total raise of $332M. The 2,660% return since batch 1 shows it is more than just hype. People now have a clear choice. BTC Bull is ready to launch soon. BlockDAG is already building what could be the future.

2025-07-08T21:14:00,"Dogecoin Price Prediction: Millionaire Scottie Pippen Eyes DOGE in His Top Picks – Is This the Catalyst Meme Traders Needed?","The Dogecoin price has dipped to $0.1698 today , with the meme token’s fall coming as the cryptocurrency market loses 3% in the past 24 hours. DOGE remains up by 5% in the past week, and while it’s down by 6.5% in the last 30 days, it holds on to a decent 56% gain in the past year. The meme token has also received a boost in the past couple of days, with six-time NBA Champion Scottie Pippen name-dropping Dogecoin in a “watch list” of altcoins. While an endorsement from a NBA legend such as Pippen may initially seem like a big deal for Dogecoin, Pippen has mixed credibility within the cryptocurrency market, given some of his bizarre actions and statements in recent months. Still, Dogecoin remains a popular meme token, and even if it has been moving slowly this year, its long-term price prediction remains positive. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Millionaire Scottie Pippen Eyes DOGE in His Top Picks – Is This the Catalyst Meme Traders Needed? Posting via his X account, former Chicago Bull Scottie Pippen confirmed that Bitcoin is his “#1”, but that he’s building a watch list. As you can see below, the list currently includes Ethereum, Solana, XRP, BNB, Cardano, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Chainlink, and Cronos, as well as Pippen’s own crypto, BALL. Bitcoin is my #1 but I'm building my watch list. What coins are you watching? I got my picks… $ETH $SOL $BNB $XRP $Ball aka @Game5Ball $ADA $DOGE $SHIB $LINK $CRO What else you got? Drop your crypto picks. — Scottie Pippen (@ScottiePippen) July 6, 2025 The tweet currently has 1,700 likes, but while it does seem to have caused a stir, it hasn’t boosted the Dogecoin price today. This is mostly because the market remains in an uncertain mood, given ongoing concerns regarding US tariffs , yet it’s also because Pippen himself is not an entirely credible figure. Not only has he launched his own Game 5 Ball NFT in recent months, but he has also produced a number of strange pronouncements, including the claim that he met Satoshi Nakamoto in 1993 . This means that his ability to attract new converts from the general public is probably minimal. And his lack of impact is apparent in Dogecoin’s price chart today, which remains in a weakened position. Source: TradingView However, it does seem as though DOGE could be close to making a recovery, given that a bullish pennant has formed on its chart. Its RSI (yellow) and MACD (orange, blue) have also begun rising, after more than a month in an oversold position. As such, it may not be long before the Dogecoin price enters a renewed period of growth, with the meme token potentially topping $0.20 by the middle of August. It may begin targeting the much-coveted $1 price point in the longer term. TOKEN6900 Raises $240,000 in Presale: Could This Be the Next Meme Token to 1000x? For traders worried that Dogecoin’s best days may be behind it, there are newer meme tokens that are showing stronger potential right now. One of these is TOKEN6900 (T6900), an ERC-20 cryptocurrency that launched its presale last week. Hey Siri, define aura pic.twitter.com/NVYT1pZmed — Token6900 (@Token_6900) July 8, 2025 It has already raised $245,000, a sign of its growing popularity, and of how successful it could be once it launches. What’s novel about TOKEN6900 is that it’s distinguishing itself from meme coins that are trying to give themselves more utility (e.g. Shiba Inu), with the new project making it clear that it has no utility and rests on hype, marketing and FOMO alone. As its declares on its website, “It’s Not Built On Fundamentals. It’s Built On Delusion, Irony, And The Collective Hallucination Of Terminally Online Traders.” It’s comparing itself with SPX6900, which has also adopted the memes and stylings of the dot-com bubble of the late 90s. It has a max supply of 930,993,091 T6900, which is precisely one more token than SPX6900 had at the time TOKEN6900’s presale opened. The project is hoping that this kind of one-upmanship will gain it followers, and judging by the early growth of its presale, the strategy is beginning to work. And while T6900 has no fundamentals whatsoever, holders will be able to stake it, earning themselves an income on top of whatever returns the token brings. Investors can buy it now by going to the TOKEN6900 website , where $T6900 costs $0.0065. This price will rise in just under two days, so traders wanting the lowest possible price should act quickly.

2025-07-08T21:00:28,"Trump’s Truth Social Announcement Excites XRP Holders. Here’s the Latest","Donald Trump’s Truth Social has sparked fresh excitement across the cryptocurrency community, especially among XRP supporters, with a newly proposed exchange-traded fund (ETF) that features the token alongside several top digital assets. Truth Social Makes Strategic Crypto Move Truth Social, the social media platform owned by Trump Media & Technology Group, is deepening its involvement in the digital asset space. The company has filed a new registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), aiming to launch an ETF called the “Crypto Blue Chip” fund. This ETF is structured to offer investors indirect exposure to a carefully selected basket of leading cryptocurrencies. According to the filing, the fund will be weighted approximately as follows: 70% Bitcoin (BTC), 15% Ethereum (ETH), 8% Solana (SOL), 5% Cronos (CRO), and 2% XRP. While XRP holds a smaller allocation compared to others, its inclusion in a Trump-backed investment vehicle has energized the XRP community, fueling speculation about greater institutional interest in the token. Key Players Behind the ETF The ETF will be sponsored by Yorkville America Digital, with Forix DAX Trust serving as the custodian. Subject to regulatory approval, the fund is set to trade on the New York Stock Exchange, offering both institutional and retail investors exposure to this diversified crypto portfolio. The unique allocation shows a deliberate mix of dominant and emerging assets, positioning the fund as an innovative offering in the growing crypto ETF market. Building on Previous Filings This isn’t Truth Social’s first ETF initiative. In recent weeks, the platform submitted proposals for both a Bitcoin spot ETF and a combined Bitcoin-Ethereum spot ETF. These efforts align with a broader push by Trump Media to become a significant player in the crypto finance space. The timing is notable, as it follows the SEC’s recent approval and subsequent temporary halt of Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund, which also features XRP , alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano. The parallels are hard to ignore, suggesting Truth Social may be looking to replicate or even challenge Grayscale’s momentum. Crypto.com Partnership and CRO’s Spotlight The ETF’s structure also highlights Truth Social’s ongoing partnership with Singapore-based Crypto.com. This collaboration has led to the launch of several “Made in America” investment products, and it explains the inclusion of Cronos (CRO), Crypto.com’s native token, which holds a 5% share in the new fund. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Following the announcement, CRO saw a surge of over 11%, reflecting heightened investor interest and renewed confidence in its market potential. What It Means for XRP Though XRP accounts for just 2% of the ETF’s total composition, its inclusion is symbolically and strategically significant. It reaffirms the token’s standing among a select group of digital assets deemed worthy of institutional exposure. This move comes as asset managers like Bitwise and Franklin Templeton await regulatory decisions on their own proposed XRP and Solana spot ETFs. Truth Social’s filing could help accelerate broader acceptance of XRP within traditional financial markets. Final Thoughts Trump’s Truth Social is making bold moves to establish itself in the digital asset arena. Its latest ETF proposal, featuring a diversified mix of top-tier cryptocurrencies including XRP, signals a strong vote of confidence in the future of blockchain-based investments. For XRP holders, the development marks another milestone, not just in visibility but in the token’s potential path toward mainstream financial adoption.

2025-07-08T21:00:04,"Last Time This Happened, Bitcoin Jumped $50,000—Is History Repeating?","The Bitcoin market appears to be coiling for a major move, according to prominent crypto analyst CrediBull Crypto (@CredibleCrypto), who highlighted today via X that over 80% of all Bitcoin in existence is currently being held by long-term investors—levels of supply constraint previously seen only at major inflection points in Bitcoin’s price history. Why No One’s Selling Bitcoin In his post, CrediBull noted, “The only 2 times in Bitcoin’s 15 year history that this % was higher was at 43k before a $30,000 impulse to 73k and at 58k before a $50,000 impulse to 105k+.” Drawing on this historical precedent, he concluded that the market is poised for another massive leg up: “When the majority of $BTC total circulating supply is cornered by ‘diamond hands’, price moves up aggressively at the hint of any ‘new’ demand.” With “excess” supply now redistributed to long-term holders and institutional entities such as Bitcoin treasury companies increasingly taking the lead, the analyst sees a clear signal: “The next impulse IS IMMINENT. This next one will also likely be even bigger than the last two ($50,000+). Who’s ready for 150k+ Bitcoin?” Related Reading: 2025’s Biggest Bitcoin Bull Trigger Is Still Hidden, Expert Reveals The optimism is not without a technical underpinning. In a previous post, CrediBull addressed the current market structure and his own Elliott Wave-based scenario planning: “My original count/idea shared a few days ago had us rejecting at range highs above 110k and seeing a pullback down to the BLUE zone at 102k-ish before moving sideways for a few more weeks before the next impulse begins.”However, the analyst acknowledged a significant alternative possibility: “I do still think this scenario is probable, I also recognize that there is a non-zero chance that the next impulse up has already begun (most bullish scenario depicted).” Given the price action and structure, CrediBull argued that the risk-reward profile no longer favors bearish positioning. “In either case, downside is relatively limited on Bitcoin from current levels imo and so focus should be on identifying potential long opps on Bitcoin rather than looking to short clear strength.” Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Liquidity Lifeline Just Got Cut—What You Need To Know He punctuated the point with a rhetorical jab: “Why is it now illegal to short Bitcoin? Because there is a non-zero chance that the next impulse up has already begun.” Adding a layer of technical confirmation, analyst Axel Adler Jr provided a concurrent signal from volatility metrics. Adler pointed to a significant Bollinger Bands squeeze underway, writing: “The range between the upper and lower boundaries has fallen to 7.7%—one of the lowest values throughout the entire bull cycle.” Such compressions in volatility historically precede large directional moves. Adler explained, “The decrease in volatility indicates energy accumulation in the market; the price is ready for a rally, and in an upward trend environment, the chances of an upward breakout are significantly higher.” In the current cycle, Adler has identified six episodes of such squeezes. Four were immediately followed by strong price appreciation, while the remaining two saw brief corrections before continuing upward. The takeaway: “Based on this experience, the current squeeze most likely foreshadows another upward impulse, although a small consolidation before the move is also not ruled out.” With long-term holders now controlling an overwhelming share of supply, bullish technical compression in play, and institutional adoption continuing to absorb circulating coins, the environment CrediBull describes echoes past moments of explosive upside. While nothing is guaranteed, the combination of on-chain metrics and technical indicators suggest Bitcoin’s next chapter may already be beginning—quietly, beneath the surface. At press time, BTC traded at $108,738.

2025-07-08T20:44:03,"In Japan’s First, Remixpoint CEO Salary Fully Shifted to Bitcoin","Japanese energy firm Remixpoint has announced it will pay its President and CEO’s entire executive compensation in Bitcoin. This marks the first time a listed company in Japan has chosen to do so. The step is part of Remixpoint’s aim to implement “shareholder-oriented management” by ensuring that management shares the same economic fate as shareholders. Bitcoin-Only Pay for Its CEO The company highlighted that its share price often moves in close correlation with Bitcoin’s price, and paying the CEO in Bitcoin will align incentives while sharing economic risks and rewards with shareholders. Remixpoint noted that at its recent general shareholders’ meeting, investors offered feedback wherein they urged management to approach corporate decisions from a shareholder’s perspective by holding shares. However, due to insider trading restrictions and other limitations faced by listed companies in Japan, acquiring and holding company shares in a timely manner can be challenging for management. As an alternative, paying the CEO in Bitcoin allows the company to build a system where economic value can be shared with shareholders while supporting its strategy of combining crypto assets, energy, and Web domains to create new corporate value. Technically, the payment will be made in Japanese yen, in line with the Companies Act and tax requirements. The same amount of Bitcoin will then be purchased at market price and transferred to a cryptocurrency wallet designated by the CEO. As a result, the exec will effectively receive his entire compensation in Bitcoin. The company views this decision as a new approach to financial and treasury management based on crypto assets while taking on the challenge of next-generation corporate strategy. “In the Same Boat” Commenting on the development, Remixpoint CEO Yoshihiko Takahashi, said “As CEO, my decision to receive all of my compensation in Bitcoin is a declaration of my intention to be “in the same boat” as our shareholders. We take responsibility for increasing corporate value and will do our utmost to manage the company from a shareholder perspective.” The executive also added that they will continue tackling the challenge of developing next-generation financial strategies and treasury management grounded in crypto assets. Remixpoint’s move comes as part of a broader trend in Japan, where more companies are turning to Bitcoin as part of their corporate strategies. Game developer Gumi recently announced it would hold a Bitcoin raffle for new shareholders, while firms such as Value Creation, Metaplanet, and SBC Medical Group have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets.

2025-07-08T20:33:36,"Phantom puts perps in traders’ pockets as mobile-first derivatives go live","Perpetual futures see over $100 billion in daily trading volume, yet most platforms still cater to pros. Phantom’s mobile-first approach could be the bridge or the breaking point for retail adoption. On July 8, Phantom, the crypto wallet best known for its seamless Solana and Ethereum integrations, rolled out perpetual futures trading directly within its app. https://twitter.com/phantom/status/1942628993636917311 Unlike traditional perps platforms that overwhelm users with complex order books and advanced charting tools, Phantom’s implementation strips derivatives trading down to its basics, letting users open leveraged positions in a few taps, right next to their NFT collections and token balances. The feature, powered by Hyperliquid’s infrastructure, offers over 100 markets, from blue chips like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) to volatile meme coins, such as Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and Pepe ( PEPE ). You might also like: After PancakeSwap ban, Turkey may target other DeFi services, regulators explain Can Phantom’s perps bridge the gap or widen the risk divide? Phantom’s move into perpetual futures is a litmus test for crypto’s retail adoption. Derivatives account for nearly 75% of all crypto trading volume, yet most platforms remain daunting for casual users, with interfaces cluttered by advanced tools like conditional orders and depth charts. By contrast, Phantom said in the press release that its integration reduces the process to three steps: fund a position with SOL (automatically converted to USDC), pick a market, and set leverage. No bridging assets, no separate exchange accounts, just a wallet-native experience. The accessibility could be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it lowers the barrier for non-professionals to engage with leveraged markets, which have historically been dominated by hedge funds and algorithmic traders. On the other, it introduces the risks inherent to derivatives, such as liquidation, funding fees, and amplified losses, to an audience that may not fully understand the mechanics. Phantom issued an explicit warning that the feature isn’t available in the U.K., where the Financial Conduct Authority has taken a hardline stance on crypto derivatives, especially for retail traders, since early 2021. Other jurisdictions with strict derivatives regulations may follow suit, though Phantom has yet to release a full list of restricted regions.
