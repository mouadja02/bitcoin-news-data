2025-07-09T16:55:10,"US Dollar Resurgence May Be Around the Corner, According to Barclays Currency Strategist – Here’s Why: Report","US dollar resurgence could be just around the corner, according to an FX strategist at the banking giant Barclays. Skylar Montgomery Koning tells Bloomberg that the dollar has already priced in the negative impact of President Donald Trump’s tariffs in its 10% drop year-to-date, noting that the greenback is primed to rise in value against foreign currencies. “The fact that some of the more problematic policies from the US administration have been dialed back – and there are deals getting done – means that the economic pain for the US won’t be as bad as originally feared.” The US dollar index (DXY) is trading at 97.57 at time of writing. The USD outlook of Barclays comes after the US dollar printed its worst first-half performance in over 50 years. The DXY plunged nearly 11% from January to June of this year, marking its steepest decline since the first six months of 1973 when the index dropped by 14.8%. Meanwhile, Kathy Jones, a chief fixed income strategist at the financial services giant Charles Schwab, tells Bloomberg Television that US trade policies and their resulting inflation could delay anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts until December or next year. Rate cuts tend to devalue the dollar. Conversely, the CME FedWatch Tool estimates there’s a 62.7% chance the Fed will cut the rate by 25 basis points at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in September. The FedWatch Tool generates probabilities using the 30-day Fed Funds futures prices.

2025-07-09T16:54:09,"Threshold Network’s tBTC is Now live on Sui: Ushering in a new era for Bitcoin DeFi","Texas, United States, July 9th, 2025, Chainwire Key Takeaways: Resolving Bitcoin’s Utility Paradox: tBTC on Sui Eliminates the Choice Between Security and Utility. Web3 Benefits with Web2 Ease : Experience Bitcoin DeFi with 400ms finality and near-zero fees on Sui’s high-performance network. Unprecedented Capital Efficiency: Bitcoin liquidity flows freely across an ecosystem of protocols, maintaining deep liquidity without fragmentation. Complete Bitcoin DeFi Suite: Immediate access to trading, lending, and leveraged DeFi strategies through tBTC, backed by 1:1 Real Bitcoin. tBTC Meets Sui: Liberating Bitcoin from Digital Vaults Threshold and Sui have announced a major integration to bring tBTC , the leading decentralized Bitcoin asset, to the Sui blockchain, engineered for mass adoption. This collaboration unlocks access to over $500 million in Bitcoin liquidity for Sui’s high-performance DeFi ecosystem, known for its near-zero fees, sub-second finality, and exceptional capital efficiency. Threshold Network’s tBTC is a decentralized, trust-minimized onchain version of Bitcoin that preserves Bitcoin’s core principles while enabling liquidity across DeFi ecosystems. Now live on Sui, tBTC empowers users to trade, lend, and engage in advanced DeFi strategies within a secure, scalable environment, with transaction finality as fast as 400 milliseconds. Sui will be the first non-EVM chain to support direct minting on the Threshold app , expanding accessibility and reinforcing its position as a premier destination for Bitcoin liquidity. On Sui, tBTC can participate in DeFi strategies within a high-speed, scalable environment—from trading and lending to more specialized use cases, such as serving as collateral on protocols like Bucket, while preserving its core properties. “Bitcoin was designed to be used, not locked away,” says Callan “Sap” Sarre, Co-founder and CPO at Threshold Labs. “With tBTC on Sui, we’re combining the security of threshold cryptography with a high-throughput network to create a new standard for Bitcoin utility. The integration will expand Sui’s growing Bitcoin ecosystem across four Sui-native protocols: Bluefin : Trade tBTC across select pairs and unlock additional APR rewards. Bucket : Save, spend, and explore Bitcoin-powered DeFi with ease. AlphaLend : Access advanced lending pairs and APR% rewards by supplying tBTC. AlphaFi : Enable high-leverage BTC DeFi strategies with auto-looping vaults. Additionally, users can also mint tBTC directly on Sui via the Threshold dApp, providing a secure and easy access point to BTCFi. Key benefits of tBTC on Sui include: Sub-Second Finality : Transactions complete in 400 milliseconds. Eliminate Fragmentation : Move Bitcoin seamlessly between protocols with near-zero fees. True Sovereignty : No reliance on centralized custodians. Web3 Power, Web2 UX : Fast, cheap, and user-friendly. Lastly, Wormhole will serve as the key interoperability provider for tBTC’s expansion to the Sui network. A dedicated bridge enabling users to move tBTC from other networks to Sui will soon be available on the Portal website. This integration will streamline cross-chain activity, making it easier for users to access Bitcoin DeFi across various ecosystems, including Sui, Ethereum, and others. “We’re excited to support Bitcoin’s growth on Sui through Wormhole’s cross-chain infrastructure,” said Robinson Burkey, Co-Founder of Wormhole. “This integration advances Bitcoin’s interoperability and unlocks new DeFi opportunities while preserving the security and decentralization users expect.” Enhanced Bitcoin DeFi Experience Bitcoin DeFi is thriving on Sui, with a significant portion of Sui’s TVL now composed of BTC-backed assets. Since February 2025, a substantial amount of Bitcoin volume has flowed into Sui-native protocols. The integration of tBTC will strengthen this ecosystem by: Unlocking seamless Bitcoin liquidity on Sui through direct tBTC minting. Supporting leveraged DeFi strategies without compromising decentralization. Delivering frictionless DeFi interactions backed by industry-grade infrastructure. As the world’s most valuable digital asset gains momentum and utility, Bitcoin expands beyond serving as a store of value to power decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Strategic Three-Month Campaign To support the launch of Threshold’s tBTC on Sui, Threshold and Sui are kicking off a three-month campaign to facilitate long-term adoption. The initiative includes protocol-level developer support and ecosystem-wide activations to ensure the Bitcoin Standard flourishes in modern DeFi applications. This also includes limited-time incentives on select Sui DeFi Protocols, namely Bucket, AlphaLend, and Bluefin. “BTC is expected to bring a massive amount of Bitcoin liquidity to Sui, creating a bridge that truly matters for institutions and everyday people who love Bitcoin,” said Adeniyi Abiodun, Co-Founder and Chief Product Officer at Mysten Labs, the original contributors to Sui. “This integration opens another door to accessible, sovereign BTCfi participation.

This is impressive performance, but some traders are expecting the coin to do even better things in the coming months, with one analyst on X – Charting Guy – pointing out that XRP’s chart this year is replicating the patterns of 2017/18. This was when XRP reached a record high of $3.40, and given the alt’s fundamentals and Ripple’s growth this year, there’s every chance that it could hit a new ATH by the winter. XRP Price Prediction: Analyst Spots 2017 Setup on XRP Chart – New All-Time High Could Be Days Away This week, the aforementioned Charting Guy posted a chart which superimposed XRP’s 2017/18 price action onto its performance over the previous year. The overlap is considerable, with the recent highs in December and January lining up with the highs in December 2017 and January 2018. $XRPBTC 2017 fractal zoomed in literally couldn’t be more accurate got the December high and January high TO THE EXACT DAY, let’s see how these next few months go (fractal is about timing, direction, and structure, not exact price) https://t.co/04PjMGJxsz pic.twitter.com/FA6cdD6eJY — Charting Guy (@ChartingGuy) July 6, 2025 However, the XRP price suffered a big drop in August 2018, before rebounding into September. And while XRP did recover in September 2018, we should note that the chart above is for XRP-Bitcoin, and not for XRP-USD (which witnessed continued declines after September’s rebound). As such, Charting Guy’s parallels aren’t perhaps helpful for the present day, which differs from 2018 in that cryptocurrency adoption has increased considerably. This means that we could expect the XRP price to recover in the later months of the year, perhaps after the US has sorted out its ongoing tariff issues with the rest of the world. Source: TradingView If we look at its chart today, we see that XRP is already beginning to recover some lost momentum. Perhaps most notably, it has broken through the pennant its highs and lows had formed over the past six months or so, a sign that it may now be pushing on to a new, higher level. We also see its RSI (yellow) climbing to 60 and moving upwards, while its MACD (orange, blue) has just turned positive for the first time since late May. These are all positive signs, and they suggest that the XRP price could hit $2.50 again in the next few weeks, before plowing on to $3 by Q4. And if the final quarter of the year does witness XRP ETF approvals , then the coin could pass $3.50. Bitcoin Hyper Raises $2.1 For BTC Layer-Two Network: Is This the Best New Platform of 2025? While XRP looks ready to do good things later this year, many traders may want to diversify into newer coins, so as to increase their exposure to potential upside. There’s no shortage of new, high-potential coins at the moment, with some of the most promising examples being presale coins. One of the most interesting of these is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), an ERC-20 crypto that has now raised just over $2.1 million in its ICO. Bitcoin Hyper is in the process of developing its own layer-two network for Bitcoin, which perhaps explains why so many investors are rushing to join its presale. As an L2, Bitcoin Hyper will provide much lower transaction fees and much higher throughput than users would get from Bitcoin itself. It provides instant bridging to and from its parent chain, with deposited BTC being converted into an ERC equivalent for use on Bitcoin Hyper’s network. Its network will be compatible with Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), giving it a high level of performance and compatibility. As for its native HYPER token, it will be necessary to pay for its transaction fees, while holders will also be able to stake it for passive income. With over 13,000 followers on X , Bitcoin Hyper is already proving popular, with investors able to join its presale by going to the Bitcoin Hyper website . HYPER currently costs $0.0122, although this will rise again in just under two days.

2025-07-09T16:32:39,"Cronos Jumps 18% After Trump Media ETF Proposal Lists Token Among Holdings","Cronos (CRO), the native token of the Crypto.com blockchain, surged nearly 18% to $0.095 Wednesday following news that it could be included in a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) backed by Trump Media & Technology Group. The proposed ETF, which is awaiting approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, would track a basket of five cryptocurrencies: bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), solana (SOL), XRP (XRP) and cronos (CRO). If approved, CRO would make up 5% of the fund’s weighting—its smallest component, but still a notable addition for a token that’s rarely featured in major institutional products. That news sent CRO soaring from about $0.08 Tuesday morning, outpacing the broader crypto market. The CoinDesk 20 Index, which tracks the top digital assets, rose just 2.8% over the same period. While the bump is significant, CRO remains a shadow of its former self. The token peaked at $0.69 in November 2021 during the last bull market. It saw a short-lived revival in December 2024, rising to $0.21 amid a market rally that followed Donald Trump’s election to a second term. That rally, however, faded fast. The ETF development has brought new attention to CRO, a token that powers Crypto.com’s ecosystem including its exchange and payments app. Still, the token has a long climb to reach its former highs. Traders appear to be reacting to the possibility of increased institutional exposure, but the SEC has yet to approve the fund.

I'm Margaux Nijkerk, CoinDesk’s Tech & Protocols reporter. In this issue: Vitalik Buterin's New Proposal Seeks 16.7M Gas Cap on Ethereum to Rein In Transaction Bloat Jack Dorsey Unveils Bitchat: Offline, Encrypted Messaging Inspired by Bitcoin Volkswagen ADMT Taps Solana-Based Hivemapper Bee Maps for Driverless Data Eigen Labs Axes 25% of Staff to Focus on Building EigenCloud Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Network News NEW ETHEREUM PROPOSAL FROM VITALIK BUTERIN: A new Ethereum proposal , co-authored by Vitalik Buterin and Toni Wahrstaetter, aims to impose a hard cap on the maximum gas a transaction can consume in a move developers say could strengthen network stability and make the chain more viable for certain applications. The proposal, EIP-7983, suggests limiting individual transactions to 16,777,216 gas (2²⁴) — a sharp change from the current design, which technically allows a single transaction to consume the gas allocation of an entire block. As a design choice, that introduces several performance and security challenges. When a single transaction consumes nearly all the available gas, it disrupts the distribution of workloads across the network and tends to make block execution less efficient. So the proposed cap is expected to simplify engineering challenges and aligns with Ethereum's shift toward modularity, though it may require splitting large transactions. — Shaurya Malwa Read more . JACK DORSEY UNVEILS BITCHAT WHITEPAPER : Jack Dorsey, founder of Twitter (now X) and fintech company Block (SQ), published a whitepaper for Bitchat, a decentralized messaging protocol that enables fully encrypted communication without the internet. Bitchat would operate over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), allowing nearby devices to form a mesh network that relays messages hop-by-hop, according to the whitepaper . When a message is sent, it would travel across nearby devices acting as temporary nodes until it reaches its recipient, making it resilient in offline or censored environments. While not making explicit references to Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency or the blockchain, Dorsey describes Bitchat as a ""decentralized, peer-to-peer messaging application,"" evoking connections to the Bitcoin whitepaper's intro in which it was described as a ""peer-to-peer version of electronic cash."" — Jamie Crawley Read more . SOLANA HIVEMAPPER AND VOLKSWAGEN TEAM UP : Volkswagen ADMT, the carmaker’s autonomous-vehicle testing subsidiary, tapped Hivemapper’s Bee Maps to support its self-driving operations with real-time mapping data. Street-level imagery collected by Bee Maps contributors using Hivemapper cameras will be used to help validate Volkswagen’s self-driving technology in an effort to boost the curbside precision of autonomous pick-ups and drop-offs, a Bee Maps spokesperson told CoinDesk. The deal highlights the growing adoption of crowdsourced geospatial data as autonomous ride-sharing firms look for more precise, up-to-date mapping infrastructure. It also showcases the growth of decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), which use blockchain incentives to crowdsource real-world data collection. Hivemapper is one of the best-known DePIN projects in the Solana ecosystem. According to the Wall Street Journal , Volkswagen’s autonomous driving unit has been testing its ‘Robotaxi’ fleet in recent months. In April, the company also announced a partnership with Uber to launch the service in U.S. markets, with pilot operations set for late 2025 and a wider rollout planned for 2026. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more . EIGENLABS LAYS OFF STAFF AMID RESTRUCTURE: Eigen Labs, the main developer firm behind restaking protocol EigenLayer, cut its workforce by 25%, losing 29 roles, as CEO Sreeram Kannan said he restructured the company to focus on developing EigenCloud , which he called a “verifiable” alternative to existing, opaque cloud services. The Seattle-based startup said the dismissals were not a cash-crunch response. The news comes as the firm has dealt with its fair share of blowback, from not having certain key mechanisms in place at the launch of its main product, to having leading Ethereum Foundation figures receive big payouts for advisory roles.

After hearing arguments from both prosecution and defense, Failla decided to grant Storm’s motion in limine moving to prohibit testimony about the sanctions entirely, arguing that it would simply be too confusing for a jury to do what she described as the “mental gymnastics” of understanding why the sanctions were imposed and ultimately removed. — Cheyenne Ligon Read more .

2025-07-09T16:15:23,"Bitcoin May Not Close at $250,000 This Year, But this Analyst is Convinced BTC Can Hit These Levels‬","Bitcoin has managed to return above the $100,000 price mark after revisiting previous support levels at $98,286. While somewhat mixed, market sentiments remain bullish as a handful of Bitcoin proponents have reiterated their conviction that the asset could reach previously unseen levels before the end of the year. Although the most bullish price forecasts for Bitcoin this year has typically started with a base price of $200,000, with pro-Bitcoin proponents like Robert Kiyosaki predicting $250,000 as a closing price for Bitcoin this year, one investor is outlining an interesting scenario for the asset, with price expectations going above the $150,000 mark but not at all crossing the $200,000 price level this year. According to Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, Bitcoin could increase its price value by 48.56% from its current level. Lee observed Bitcoin’s recent upward correction, explaining that ETF inflows contributed largely to the asset’s recovery. Notably, U.S.-based Bitcoin ETFs saw the largest single-day inflow on Tuesday, June 28, with a total of $588.6 million recorded, according to data from Farside Investors. The new development marks 11 days of consecutive positive inflows—the longest period of consistent inflows recorded since December 2024. Although Lee maintains that investors are exercising caution at this time, he predicts that Bitcoin is still well on its way to hitting new highs this year. According to his timeline, Bitcoin could secure a price value of $110,000-$115,000 within the third quarter of this year. His year-end price prediction $130,000-$160,000 is even more bullish. For Ether, the second most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap, Lee predicts a $2,600-$2,800 attainable short-term target for the asset, but with increased expectations, he forecasts $5,500 as a long-term target. At the time of this report, Bitcoin is up 0.95% from the previous day and is currently trading at $109,152 at press time.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-may-not-close-at-250000-this-year-but-this-analyst-is-convinced-btc-can-hit-these-levels/,"BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|EXCHANGE","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

2025-07-09T16:08:36,"BTC Stalls Just Below $110,000 Amidst Heavy Sell Pressure","Bitcoin made an ambitious push toward the $110,000 mark on July 9, but selling pressure halted its advance just short of the milestone. BTC/USD peaked at $109,777 on Bitstamp before reversing, according to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView. The price remains constrained within a tight range, with liquidity clustering at key levels. Order book data from CoinGlass indicated strong buying interest around $108,500 and heavy sell pressure near $110,500, which appears to be capping further gains for now. Traders Signal Caution as Liquidity Concentrates Despite the temporary pullback, many market participants are optimistic that Bitcoin may be preparing for another rally. Trader Jelle noted the heavy liquidity above $110,000 and suggested a successful breakout could quickly push the price much higher. “Almost all liquidity is to the upside. Stops above $110k are not safe,” he commented on X, forecasting a possible move to $130,000 if the resistance is broken. Analyst BitBull highlighted technical indicators that might support this bullish scenario. He pointed to a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern on the 3-day RSI and price charts. “For breakout, we need one of these 2 things. Either a 3D close above $110K or a 3D RSI close above 70. After that, we’ll experience an up-only rally for 3-4 weeks,” he explained. Volatility Expected as Macro Factors Weigh on Sentiment Beyond technicals, broader macroeconomic factors are also expected to influence Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory. QCP Capital, in its latest bulletin to Telegram subscribers, said the upcoming U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report could introduce volatility in the crypto and equities markets. The firm emphasized that recent strong jobs data had already cooled optimism around near-term interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. “Markets have scaled back expectations to two cuts in 2025, down from 2.5 previously. A July cut is all but priced out. September odds have slipped from 90% to 70%,” the bulletin noted. This shift in expectations has placed additional focus on upcoming economic data releases. Despite these uncertainties, QCP described Bitcoin as “well bid,” supported by institutional inflows and a weakening U.S. dollar. “With a reignited trade war, a more hawkish Fed, and tightening liquidity conditions, the stage is set for elevated volatility,” the firm added. “Macro catalysts are lining up. Buckle up,” QCP concluded. Outlook Hinges on Breaking $110K While BTC has so far failed to close above $110,000 since June 11, traders remain alert for a breakout that could mark the beginning of a stronger bullish trend. The presence of sell-side liquidity above the current level continues to pose a challenge, but the alignment of technical signals and macroeconomic catalysts may offer enough fuel for Bitcoin to attempt another leg higher. Until then, investors appear to be watching liquidity zones and upcoming inflation data closely for signs of the next major move.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/btc-stalls-just-below-110000-amidst-heavy-sell-pressure/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

The preliminary prospectus stated the Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF will consist of 70% BTC, 15% ETH, 8% SOL, 5% CRO, and 2% XRP. “The Trust is a passive investment vehicle that seeks to reflect generally the performance of the prices of the Portfolio Assets before payment of the Trust’s expenses and liabilities,” the filing reads. The investment vehicle is being launched in collaboration with Yorkville America Digital, the same asset manager backing Trump Media’s previous applications for a dual Bitcoin and Ether ETF , as well as a standalone BTC fund . Crypto.com’s custody affiliate, Foris DAX Trust Company, will act as the fund’s custodian, responsible for safekeeping the underlying assets. Shares of the ETF are intended to be offered on the New York Stock Exchange Arca and issued in creation units of 10,000 after regulatory approvals. The S-1 statement filed with the SEC is one of two important documents required before the ETF can go live for trading. The next step involves the exchange filing a Form 19b-4 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, kicking off a review timeline. The crypto Blue Chip ETF filing comes as digital asset-based funds gain popularity among investors in the U.S. Bitcoin ETFs have attracted $50 billion in net inflows since their inception in January 2024.

2025-07-09T15:36:31,"Ledger Offers a 30% Discount on Most Colors for Nano S Plus and Nano X Until July 15","Ledger has announced a limited-time 30% discount on nearly all color models of its popular Nano S Plus and Nano X hardware wallets, valid through July 15. The promotion has drawn fresh attention to the company’s flagship products, widely regarded as industry benchmarks for secure crypto storage. Together, the Nano S Plus and Nano X boast 13,345 reviews, the majority of which are positive, underscoring the strong trust and satisfaction among users worldwide. But what makes Ledger such a popular hardware wallet? Ledger Wallet’s Blend of Security, Comfort, and Style – this is what makes them so attractive to its loyal fanbase and newbies alike. Ledger excels in the areas of security, comfort level, and overall style, but it’s the wallet’s security features that attract users. Ledger relies on a multi-layered security profile, with several noticeable features, like: ✅ The PIN code that secures the actual device to prevent unauthorized access is required to complete any transaction ✅ The 24-word phrase, which acts as the master key, secures your funds against any malicious access ✅ The trademark Blockchain Open Ledger Operating System (BOLOS), which isolates any installed apps from one another and the 24-word phrase from all apps and the operating system itself ✅ Secure Element Chip, the hardware component that keeps the private keys offline for a higher level of security Plus, Ledger’s Donjon team, which consists of seasoned hackers, is constantly testing the products’ security to identify any potential vulnerabilities. Their efforts are part of Ledger’s Bug Bounty program, which rewards anyone who finds security weaknesses in Bitcoin, showcasing the team’s commitment to continuous improvements in the security department. While security is the most important aspect, other features matter as well, like the comfort level associated with carrying and using the wallet. Ledger’s Nano S Plus and Nano X are the sleekest and most comfortable to use and wear, thanks to their slim builds. Nano S Plus consists of steel and plastic, weighing only 0.74 ounces, while Nano X is slightly larger, thanks to the lithium battery, reaching 1.19 ounces. The slim format makes them comfortable to wear, even as keychains if you always insist on having them with you. Finally, the color palette offers a final touch to the already unique style, imbuing the wallets with a modern vibe. Colors like emerald-green, sapphire-blue, and amethyst-purple come with a plus of personality and X factor. The Massive 30% Discount Ends on July 15 Ledger’s flash promotion (offering a 30% discount on its Nano S Plus and Nano X wallets) is set to end on July 15, giving buyers less than a week to take advantage. The deal aims to spotlight two of Ledger’s most widely used products, with a combined user base of around 7 million worldwide. Most color options are eligible, with only onyx-black and BTC-orange for the Nano X, and matte-black and BTC-orange for the Nano S Plus excluded from the promotion. Should You Buy the Ledger Wallet?

Or, at the very least, until July 15, when the current 30% promotion ends, because discounts like these don’t come often. Also, go to Ledger’s website and scroll through their offers.

2025-07-09T15:30:48,"Elon Musk Drops Epstein ‘Peanut’ Bomb — PNUT Coin Explodes 10%","A sudden social media jab sent Solana’s Peanut the Squirrel token soaring this week. In a Tuesday post, billionaire Elon Musk criticized US authorities for ignoring names on the Jeffrey Epstein “client list”, quipping that “more squirrels and raccoons have been arrested” than any Epstein affiliates. Related Reading: XRP Could Hit $35 If It Captures A Quarter Of Remittance Market By 2029 A nod to a squirrel named Peanut—said to have been “arrested (and killed)”—coincided with a sharp pop in the PNUT token’s value. According to on‑chain data, PNUT climbed over 10% in 24 hours, touching $0.23 at one point. Elon Musk Highlights Justice Concerns Based on reports, Musk’s post racked up more than 13.7 million views within hours. Traders quickly linked “Peanut” to the PNUT ticker. Almost immediately, PNUT price rose from about $0.22 to $0.23. Peanut price up in the last 24 hours. Source: Coingecko The token’s 24‑hour trading volume jumped roughly 80%, crossing $215 million. Market watchers estimate PNUT’s market cap now sits near $224 million, out of a total supply approaching 1 billion tokens. Market Reaction Follows Viral Meme Meme tokens often depend on hype, and PNUT was no exception. After Musk’s message spread, order books filled fast. Buy orders outnumbered sells, driving price momentum. Crypto bots and retail traders piled in, hoping to catch the wave. Some investors told reporters they moved funds into PNUT within minutes of seeing Musk’s post. They arrested (and killed) Peanut, but have not even tried to file charges against anyone on the Epstein client list. Government is deeply broken. pic.twitter.com/YndRadQUBE — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 8, 2025 Token Jump Drives Trading Frenzy Solana’s speedy network helped too. Transactions cleared in seconds, letting traders react without delay. That low‑fee environment amplifies meme coin rallies: when hype hits, people can buy or sell without worrying about high gas costs. In this case, volume spiked from around $120 million to $214 million in under a day. Related Reading: 2% Of All XRP Is In His Hands — But Who Is He? Looking Ahead, Caution Advised Despite the rush, crypto veterans warn that PNUT’s gains could reverse just as fast. Meme tokens lack fundamentals, and hype fades quickly. Traders could face losses if views shift or if Musk moves on to the next joke. For now, Musk’s satirical jab has put Peanut the Squirrel on center stage. Whether PNUT can hold its gains may depend on more viral moments—and on whether investors remember to take profits before the next twist. No ‘Client List’ Meanwhile, according to a memo obtained by Axios, the Justice Department and FBI under US President Donald Trump found no evidence that convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein blackmailed powerful individuals, kept a “client list,” or was murdered.

2025-07-09T15:30:15,"US Senate Bill Targets Bukele’s Bitcoin Strategy With Massive Sanctions Plan","A trio of Senate Democrats has introduced legislation that would not only blacklist President Nayib Bukele and his inner circle but also order a forensic probe of El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy. Filed on 12 June by Senators Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), the El Salvador Accountability Act of 2025 ( S. 2058 ) sits before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Dems Target El Salvadors Bitcoin Strategy The bill would trigger full economic-blockading powers under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, freeze US-controlled assets of thirteen named Salvadoran officials—including Bukele, Vice-President Félix Ulloa and the president of the Central Reserve Bank—and revoke their visas. It also compels US directors at the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other multilaterals to vote against new loans to San Salvador while cutting off direct US assistance. Section 5 is the measure’s Bitcoin fulcrum. Within 90 days of enactment, the Secretary of State, in consultation with Treasury, must deliver “a report on the actions of officials of the Government of El Salvador, including President Nayib Bukele , to use cryptocurrency as a mechanism for gross corruption, graft, and sanctions evasion,” together with wallet addresses, exchange counterparties and an estimate of the state’s Bitcoin stash. That language resurrects concerns first formalized in the bipartisan Accountability for Cryptocurrency in El Salvador (ACES) Act of 2022, which ordered a risk assessment of Bukele’s original 2021 Bitcoin Law. In January this year, Bukele’s super-majority quietly stripped Bitcoin of its legal-tender status —part of an IMF rescue deal—though the asset remains accepted for payments and sits on the treasury’s balance sheet. The sponsors insist the sanctions push is foremost a human-rights response. “Under President Bukele, tens of thousands of Salvadorans and even US residents remain jammed in megaprisons without due process,” Kaine said on introduction. Van Hollen added that Bukele is “taking American taxpayer dollars to imprison people as part of a scheme to violate their constitutional rights,” while Padilla called the crackdown “abhorrent” and said economic penalties are “a necessary step.” Yet the text’s Bitcoin provisions signal Washington’s broader anxiety that a dollarized economy holding un-audited Bitcoin reserves could morph into a sanctions-evasion node—particularly if the Trump administration were to soften scrutiny. The bill would force the State and Treasury departments to expose addresses, custodians and governance arrangements for the Salvadoran wallets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Volatility Hits Bull Cycle Low – Bollinger Bands Signal Potential Breakout Bukele, never shy on social media, greeted the proposal with characteristic derision. “HAHAHAHAHAHAHA the Dems are just salty…” he wrote on X shortly after the bill went public. Because S. 2058 invokes §502B of the Foreign Assistance Act, any committee member can force it to the floor if the State Department fails to furnish the mandated reports—an arcane privilege the sponsors have already flagged they are prepared to use. Still, Republicans have yet to signal support, and the House remains an open question. If the measure passes intact, the White House would have ten days to list sanctioned individuals and 90 days to deliver the report. Sanctions could not be lifted for at least four years, and only after a presidential certification that El Salvador has ceased both its mass-detention state of exception and any Bitcoin-enabled sanctions evasion, according to the proposed bill.

2025-07-09T15:29:33,"The Evolution of Crypto Trading: From Wild West to Regulated Innovation","The journey of cryptocurrency trading constantly evolves and has been nothing short of revolutionary. Right from the start, the cryptocurrency landscape has been referred to as the “wild west” due to its nature of decentralisation and minimal oversight. However, now the space consists of increasingly sophisticated and regulated financial products and the transformation has been profound. The shift in perception has been a critical development in driving the need for robust frameworks that foster institutional adoption and, crucially, boost investor confidence. In its infancy, crypto trading was the domain of early tech evangelists and a niche community of retail investors leveraging the premise of decentralised permissionless finance. Bitcoin embodied this concept, and exchanges with varying degrees of transparency facilitated the trading of bitcoin and the introduction of other altcoins. Liquidity was thin, price swings were extreme and the lack of regulation meant significant risks for participants. The “wild west” held huge appeal due to the promise of innovation and the disruption of traditional finance. Yet this unregulated environment also bred systemic vulnerabilities, i.e., frequent exchange hacks, pump-and-dump schemes and a lack of consumer protection. Back then, events such as the Mt. Gox collapse deterred larger financial institutions and a broader retail audience from engaging in digital assets. Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option We’d love your feedback! CoinDesk is conducting a confidential survey. Start Survey . Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option The maturation phase As the crypto market cap swelled, particularly during the ICO boom of 2017 and subsequent bull runs, so did the demand for regulatory oversight. Most regulators adopted a wait-and-see approach; however, incidents within the space, driven by market volatility and concerns over illicit financing, pushed the agenda for regulation forward. The perception and overall sentiment of regulatory oversight have shifted. It is now a common concept that effective regulation is not about stifling innovation, but about supporting and enabling growth and integrating crypto into the broader financial system. Regulation: enabling trust and institutional access What’s underpinning the regulatory shift happening within the industry? It is the recognition that regulation isn’t a hindrance but rather a catalyst for trust and adoption. An example of this is the recent approval of spot bitcoin and ethereum ETFs in major financial markets. These investment products provide institutional and retail investors with exposure to the underlying cryptocurrency through regulated platforms, unlocking massive liquidity and further labelling cryptocurrency as a viable asset class. This development was unimaginable a few years ago. The European Union's comprehensive Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation , which began to be phased in 2024, is another huge milestone for the evolution of cryptocurrency trading. MiCA aims to create a harmonised regulatory framework across all EU member states, covering the issuance of crypto-assets, their public offering and the services provided by Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs). With the European Union leading the way here, other major government bodies will surely follow. While the early crypto market was a hotbed for speculative assets such as memecoins, the maturation within the space has led to a demand for trading ‘blue-chip’ tokens. These are typically the most liquid and well-capitalised cryptocurrencies that have proven their resilience across various market cycles. Traders are increasingly gravitating towards these more stable assets, seeking long-term growth potential rather than chasing the more risky, fleeting crypto trends. Providers are also leaning towards offering these types of assets as part of their commitment to responsible trading. The ""wild west"" era of crypto trading is fast becoming a distant memory, replaced by a new paradigm of regulated innovation. This evolution is not just vital for the long-term sustainability and mainstream adoption of digital assets, but also for building a more secure and accessible global financial system.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-indices/2025/07/09/the-evolution-of-crypto-trading-from-wild-west-to-regulated-innovation,"TRADING|REGULATION|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS","CoinDesk Indices|Regulation|Institutional Investment|Crypto Long & Short|CoinDesk Indices|Opinion|News",cryptocompare

With the Bitcoin Solaris Nova App launch live, a listing on LBank confirmed, and its presale phase 9 hitting final-stage hype, the project is positioning itself for a July breakout. But while Bitcoin Solaris leans on app excitement and last-minute presale heat, BlockDAG has already scaled the mobile mining mountain. Its X1 Miner has crossed 2 million active users, driven by a presale that has now raised $334 million at a current price of $0.0016, giving early buyers an ROI of 2,660%, and the momentum hasn’t slowed. Bitcoin Solaris Heats Up with Nova App & Final Presale Phase The Bitcoin Solaris Nova App launch has grabbed attention with its mobile-first push and tap-to-mine functionality. It’s a slick move aimed at crypto newcomers who want an easier on-ramp. Tied in with Bitcoin Solaris listed on LBank and nearing the end of presale phase 9, it’s crafted a well-timed story of accessibility meets opportunity. To drive urgency, the project added a 72-hour price rollback to $5, designed to mimic early presale returns. Throw in bold claims of 150% potential ROI and 100,000+ transactions processed, and it’s clear this isn’t just another quiet app rollout. They’re aiming to close the presale strong. But traction isn’t the same as adoption. Launching a mobile app in crypto is step one. Keeping users engaged and building utility is what separates trend from traction. The final push of presale phase 9 will show whether users are here for the hype, or for the long haul. Over 2 Million Users Are Already Mining With BlockDAG While Bitcoin Solaris leans on app launch hype, BlockDAG’s X1 mobile miner is already setting the standard, and it’s not even close. With over 2 million users already mining from their phones, the X1 app is leading the mobile-first charge in crypto. It’s simple to use, doesn’t drain battery or data, and actually ties user activity to BDAG token rewards. It’s not vaporware, this is a functioning product rolled out ahead of mainnet. What sets the X1 apart is that it’s not just onboarding users, it’s activating them. From the moment someone starts mining, they’re participating in the larger BlockDAG ecosystem. It builds habit, loyalty, and it’s backed by a $334M presale, full CertiK and Halborn audits, and a roadmap that goes way beyond just mobile. We’re talking about a live DeFi suite, low-code dApp builder, NFT integrations, and 10K+ TPS performance on testnet. BlockDAG also isn’t shy about marketing firepower. The brand has partnered with Major League Cricket’s Seattle Orcas, and Major League Rugby’s Seattle Seawolves which gives it a real-world presence that boosts credibility and reach. When a project is scaling in product, user base, capital, and culture all at once, traders don’t just pay attention, they get in. While Bitcoin Solaris is announcing launches, BlockDAG is stacking wins. And users are showing up. Hype vs Head Start The Bitcoin Solaris Nova App launch signals serious intent. Paired with its final presale phase 9 and a timely Bitcoin Solaris listing, the project is trying to engineer a breakout moment. They’ve built a strong narrative, from the rollback promo to mobile-first positioning, and it’s catching attention. But here’s where things separate. BlockDAG already has the receipts. Its X1 mobile miner app isn’t a promise, it’s in people’s hands, running daily, earning BDAG, and creating real utility. It’s not about who launched first, it’s about who’s delivering now. Bitcoin Solaris listed on LBank is a good start. But listings don’t equal loyalty. The Nova App is sleek, but it’s untested at scale. Meanwhile, BlockDAG is onboarding millions, integrating DeFi, and driving ecosystem usage, all before its mainnet is even live. That’s not future potential, that’s execution in real time The Bottom Line Bitcoin Solaris is playing it smart. The Nova App launch, final presale phase 9, and fresh Bitcoin Solaris listing all land at the right time. It’s got attention, momentum, and a slick mobile angle that resonates with a crowd ready to mine from their phones. But while Solaris is preparing to launch, BlockDAG is already running laps around it. The X1 mobile miner has over 2 million users live and earning, and it’s just one part of a broader $334M-fueled ecosystem. DeFi tools, smart partnerships, and a verified presale give it more than hype, it has muscle. So while Bitcoin Solaris is still warming up, BlockDAG is already out front setting the pace. And when it comes to real traction in mobile mining, the market’s already made its move.

2025-07-09T15:00:13,"Over 120 Million Cardano (ADA) in Two Weeks. Here’s What Happened","Cardano (ADA) is back in the spotlight after prominent crypto analyst Ali reported a massive accumulation by whales —wallets holding large amounts of cryptocurrency, who have collectively acquired more than 120 million ADA in just the past two weeks. The development, shared via Ali’s post on X, signals a significant shift in investor sentiment, with large players positioning themselves for what could be a strong upward move. Whale Accumulation Signals Renewed Confidence According to Ali’s analysis, this recent buying spree adds to a broader pattern of strategic accumulation by high-net-worth holders. The data shows that these investors are not just buying dips but actively consolidating their positions even amid current price consolidation. Whales bought over 120 million Cardano $ADA in the last two weeks! pic.twitter.com/HOjvzB6fqd — Ali (@ali_charts) July 8, 2025 This behavior suggests a growing confidence in ADA’s long-term value proposition, as whales typically accumulate when they anticipate future price appreciation. On-chain analytics platforms, including IntoTheBlock, confirmed Ali’s findings. Wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million ADA have shown a marked increase in holdings since late June. This spike in accumulation corresponds with a sharp decline in ADA held on exchanges, indicating that whales are moving their tokens into long-term cold storage, another bullish signal. Technical Setup Points to Impending Breakout From a technical standpoint, ADA is currently trading in a tight range between $0.66 and $0.74, with $0.70 serving as a critical resistance level. Analysts note that this zone has capped several recent rally attempts, making it a key area to watch. A decisive breakout above this level could open the door for a move toward $0.83 and potentially $0.91, levels that align with historical Fibonacci retracement targets. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains neutral but has shown bullish divergence on lower timeframes, while rising volume and positive funding rates suggest growing market interest. If price action is confirmed by strong on-chain flows, ADA may soon escape the sideways trend it has followed for much of Q2. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ecosystem Growth May Be Driving Demand Beyond technicals, Cardano’s growing ecosystem is another factor attracting whale attention. Developments like Cardinal, which aims to bring Bitcoin liquidity into Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem, have strengthened the blockchain’s appeal. Additionally, the rising Total Value Locked (TVL) on Cardano-based platforms, now hovering near all-time highs, demonstrates increasing user and developer engagement. There is also growing optimism around the potential for a Cardano Spot ETF soon, especially in the wake of multiple Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF approvals in global markets. Bloomberg analysts have suggested ADA could be among the next wave of crypto assets to gain institutional product access, which may explain the strategic positioning by whales. Outlook: A Pivotal Moment for ADA While Cardano still faces strong resistance at key price levels, the scale of recent whale accumulation cannot be ignored. Ali’s observation is backed by clear on-chain evidence, and if market momentum aligns with the current buying trend, ADA could be poised for a meaningful breakout in the weeks ahead. Investors should keep a close eye on whether ADA can hold above $0.70 and whether whale activity continues at this scale. If both conditions hold, Cardano may be entering a new phase of its market cycle, one marked by institutional accumulation and broader price expansion.

The total supply of ckBTC (Chain-Key Bitcoin) on ICP has increased from 254 to 349 tokens since June 9, a 37% rise in under a month, a post on X highlighted . This marks an uptick in Bitcoin inflows into ICP’s DeFi infrastructure, which offers secures fast interoperability. On the price action side, ICP traded within a $0.21 range between $4.73 and $4.93, with a clear upward bias. Momentum intensified with volume bursts and higher-lows structure. The surge from $4.90 to $4.93 during the 10:41–11:40 UTC window was powered by institutional-style accumulation, peaking at 59,999 units at 11:29 UTC, well above the daily average. ICP had held support at $4.73, and a successful retest of $4.90 at 10:52 UTC confirmed it as a new support floor. With structural strength in place, growing ecosystem usage, and DeFi-driven demand from ckBTC, ICP appears well-positioned to challenge the next upside milestone. Technical Analysis Highlights ICP gained 3% over 24 hours, trading between $4.73 and $4.93. Support held firm at $4.73, forming the base for the rally. Breakout above $4.90 was confirmed at 10:59 UTC with strong follow-through. Volume surges at 11:23 (33,830 units), 11:28 (27,673 units), and 11:29 (59,999 units) indicate accumulation. A pullback to $4.90 at 10:52 UTC was successfully defended before fresh highs. Ecosystem usage grows as ckBTC supply on ICP rises 37% since June 9, per X.

2025-07-09T14:51:07,"Solana at critical decision point: will SOL breakout to $176 or tumble to $131?","Solana is testing a highly technical resistance zone. A breakout could trigger a move toward $176, while a rejection risks a return to the $131 support level. Volume confirmation remains the deciding factor. Solana’s ( SOL ) price action is approaching a critical inflection point. After reclaiming the point of control within its current trading range, the asset is now challenging a dense resistance cluster. The outcome at this level, whether a breakout or a rejection, will likely determine the next major move. A breakout could initiate a bullish expansion toward the $176 region, while failure to overcome this confluence zone would suggest continued range-bound behavior between $154 and $131. Key technical points Reclaimed Point of Control: Price action has returned above the volume-weighted average zone. Stacked Resistance at $154: Includes the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement and anchored VWAP from highs. Volume Still Lacking: Breakout must be supported by volume or risks invalidation. SOLUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView Solana recently rebounded from a key swing low just below $130, triggering a strong upward move that peaked at $187. Since then, the price has been confined within a defined range, oscillating between the value area high near $154 and the value area low around $131. Reclaiming the point of control signaled renewed interest from buyers, but the current rally is encountering significant headwinds. Price is now testing a technically dense resistance region marked by two major confluences: the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement from the previous swing high and the anchored VWAP drawn from the top of the range. This dual-layered resistance makes the area structurally significant, and difficult to break without strong momentum. You might also like: DNSBTC celebrates 2m users with free BTC, LTC cloud mining contracts If Solana fails to reclaim this resistance zone on a closing candle basis, a move back toward the $131 support level is likely. This would keep price locked within the broader range and reinforce the rotational structure of the current market. However, if resistance is broken decisively, and most importantly, with supporting volume, the probability of a bullish expansion increases significantly. The next target would be the $176 region, aligning with a prior swing high and high time frame resistance. A key variable to watch here is volume. The current push higher has occurred with declining participation, raising the risk of a false breakout. If demand fails to materialize near the highs, price is likely to rotate lower once again. What to expect in the coming price action Solana is at a technical crossroads. A breakout above $154, backed by volume, opens the path to $176. Failure to reclaim this zone increases the likelihood of a rotation back to the $131 support area.

The company announced that its short-term objective is to acquire 3,000 BTC , although this target may be adjusted based on Bitcoin’s market price and Remixpoint’s stock performance (3825.T). In a July 9 statement translated from Japanese, Remixpoint explained, “ We have become even more convinced of Bitcoin’s future, and this decision is the result of extensive discussions to enhance corporate value from a risk-return perspective, while also keeping future options open. “ リミックスポイント本日開示 ファイナンスにて約315億円資金調達 資金使途、全額BTC取得 目先『3000BTC保有』を目指す ※BTC価格、株価により変動あり （初回以降は3日連続取引日の平均株価） 背景 より一層ビットコインの未来に確信を 持ち、議論を重ねた結果となります。… — リミックスポイント公式Xアカウント (@remixpoint_x) July 9, 2025 Japanese Remixpoint Building on Existing Bitcoin Strategy Remixpoint has been accumulating Bitcoin since September 2024, establishing itself as a significant corporate holder in the cryptocurrency space. According to Bitcoin treasuries data, Remixpoint ranks as the 30th publicly listed company by Bitcoin holdings with 1,051 BTC, surpassing firms like Nano Labs and The Smarter Web Company at the time of writing. The company’s commitment to Bitcoin was demonstrated earlier this year when it approved a ¥1 billion ($7 million) Bitcoin purchase following a board resolution in May. Japan’s Remixpoint approves another $7M Bitcoin purchase, raising total crypto holdings to $84M. #Japan #Remixpoint #Bitcoin https://t.co/ozpqS3v3QL — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 26, 2025 Beyond Bitcoin, Remixpoint has expanded its digital asset holdings to include Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), and Avalanche ( AVAX ). In September 2024, the firm invested approximately $351,700 to acquire 130.1 ETH , 2,260.5 SOL, and 12,269.9 AVAX tokens. The Japanese firm’s crypto commitment extends to executive compensation, with the company becoming the first Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed entity to pay its CEO and President entirely in Bitcoin. According to the report, CEO Yoshihiko Takahashi characterized this decision as a “ clear signal ” of his commitment to corporate value and shareholder-focused governance. Moreover, Remixpoint’s stock price has demonstrated a strong correlation with Bitcoin’s performance, benefiting from the cryptocurrency’s success. When Bitcoin reached its lows of $77,000 in April, 3825.T shares traded at ¥328 ($2.26). As Bitcoin climbed above $109,000 in May, the stock price more than doubled to ¥701 ($4.88).

Growing Japanese Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Remixpoint’s strategy aligns with an emerging trend among publicly listed companies that incorporate Bitcoin into their balance sheets. While U.S.-based companies like MicroStrategy have popularized this approach , Remixpoint joins a growing list of Japanese firms adopting similar models. Metaplanet, another Bitcoin-focused Japanese company, has consistently expanded its holdings of BTC. Japanese investment firm @Metaplanet_JP has unveiled an ambitious new target to amass 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. #Metaplanet #Bitcoin https://t.co/jCQ3G0uzPC — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 6, 2025 On Monday, Metaplanet purchased an additional 2,205 BTC , bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to 15,555 BTC, valued at approximately 225.8 billion yen ($1.7 billion). In April, NASDAQ-listed Japanese beauty and cosmetic surgery clinic operator SBC Medical Group Holdings completed a Bitcoin purchase worth over $418,000 . Moreover, Japan’s evolving regulatory landscape is supporting the increased adoption of cryptocurrencies. The country is preparing to formally recognize crypto assets as financial products under its Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and is moving toward approving Bitcoin ETFs. These developments are expected to encourage more Japanese companies and citizens to embrace Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investments. Government officials are also considering Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Satoshi Hamada, a member of parliament from the Party to Protect the People from NHK, has called for the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve , similar to recent proposals from lawmakers in Argentina, Russia, and other countries.

2025-07-09T14:39:18,"Cantor Equity Partners: Waiting On Merger With Twenty One Capital","Summary Cantor Equity Partners is merging with Twenty One Holdings to create a Bitcoin-focused entity, measuring performance in Bitcoin terms. Twenty One will introduce Bitcoin Per Share and Bitcoin Return Rate as new performance metrics for shareholders. Current share conversion ratios for Cantor Equity Partners are examined to determine if CEP represents an opportunity. Cantor Equity Partners ( CEP ) announced a reverse merger on April 22, 2025, which will merge into a new entity, Twenty One Capital Inc. Cantor Equity Partners was incorporated in 2020 under a different name, and in June 2024, the company changed its name and prepared for its IPO in August 2024. Currently, if an investor wants to invest before the merger becomes official, they must purchase Cantor Equity Partners' shares. The purpose of this article will be to examine shares of Cantor Equity Partners to determine the opportunity at hand in the case that the merger is completed. Investors Several interesting parties have come together to spearhead this merger. This impressive list of investors will be major voices in determining the direction of the company. Bitfinex Bitfinex is a cryptocurrency exchange headquartered in the British Virgin Islands and is contributing 7,000 bitcoins to the merger. Given their expertise in Bitcoin exchange operations, they could be a valuable partner to the company. Bitfinex will be one of the largest shareholders, along with those mentioned below. Softbank Group Softbank, headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, is a major investor in the new company and is contributing approximately $900 million in capital. They are projected to hold 26.1% of shares when the merger is completed. Tether Tether, the largest USD stablecoin issuer, will be the majority shareholder in the company. There is a gray area surrounding how much ownership will be given to these major shareholders, but Tether is expected to hold nearly 50 percent of the equity and greater than 50 percent of the voting power. The following table shows a breakdown of what ownership will look like before and after the conversion of some convertible notes offered in the deal. This graphic was sourced from an article on CoinDesk describing the merger. Pre and Post Convert Twenty One Shares (Twenty One Capital Presentation ) Management & Friends CEO Jack Mallers Well-known Bitcoin investor and entrepreneur Jack Mallers will lead the company while also leading his current company, Strike. Strike is a Bitcoin company that offers various Bitcoin-related services. Here is a statement from Jack Mallers on what he hopes Twenty One Capital will become. We believe that Bitcoin is the answer, and Twenty One is how we bring that answer to public markets. Our mission is simple: to become the most successful company in Bitcoin, the most valuable financial opportunity of our time. We’re not here to beat the market, we’re here to build a new one. A public stock, built by Bitcoiners, for Bitcoiners. Friends in High Places Howard Lutnick formerly served as the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, where he reportedly invested over $1 billion into Strategy, the original Bitcoin treasury company. This was prior to Lutnick stepping down as CEO to serve as the Secretary of Commerce inside the Trump administration. With Lutnick no longer the CEO, his son Brandon Lutnick now leads Cantor Fitzgerald. This is another key relationship for the company that will potentially give it unique access to capital markets. Creating Value Twenty One, headquartered in New York City, will be concentrated on creating value in Bitcoin terms. It remains to be seen what their exact strategy will be, but we know they will be measuring their company's performance in Bitcoin. Will they implement a strategy similar to the company now known as Strategy...formerly MicroStrategy (Strategy) ( MSTR )? Here is a quote from Cantor's press release . As part of its launch, Twenty One will introduce two key performance metrics, to reflect its Bitcoin-denominated capital structure and Bitcoin-focused mindset. Bitcoin Per Share ((BPS)): Amount of Bitcoin each fully-diluted share represents, reflecting shareholder ownership in Bitcoin rather than fiat earnings per share. Bitcoin Return Rate (BRR): Rate at which BPS grows over time, denominating the company’s performance in Bitcoin. Bitcoin Treasury Companies and Market Net Asset Value (MNAV) Currently, Bitcoin treasury companies are often valued in terms of their market net asset value, or MNAV, which is a measure of the market value of the Bitcoin they own, less any debt on the balance sheet. Strategy Since Twenty One will be a Bitcoin treasury company, much like Strategy currently is, it is appropriate to measure them in relation to the amount of Bitcoin they will hold when the merger is completed, as well as relative to how Strategy is being valued. As of Strategy's latest press release , the company owns 580,250 bitcoin. As of 7/8/2025, Bitcoin is valued at $109,000, giving Strategy an asset value of over $68 billion. Strategy's total debt is $10.4 billion as of their March 2025 financial report, leaving them with an MNAV of about $57.6 billion. Their current market cap is $112 billion, giving them an MNAV of just below two. Twenty One Capital and Its Bitcoin Holdings Twenty One Holdings expects the company to hold around 42,000 bitcoins post-merger, which would make it the second largest Bitcoin treasury company behind Strategy and the third public company Bitcoin treasury behind Strategy and MARA Holdings ( MARA ). With Bitcoin's price at $109,000, it places the market value of their Bitcoin at around $4.6 billion. Cantor Equity Partners Conversion Ratio The proposed merger is a reverse merger where the Cantor Equity Partners shares will convert into shares of Twenty One Holdings with the ticker symbol XXI. Public SPAC holders of Cantor Equity Partners are expected to hold 2.7 percent of the company after the merger is finalized. The company is expected to hold somewhere in the range of 42,000 bitcoins, meaning the market value of its Bitcoin at today's price is (42,000 x $109,000) about $4.6 billion. Now, if we apply a similar MNAV to Cantor Equity Partners as Strategy currently has, that equals a projected market capitalization of $9.2 billion, assuming the company has no debt. Cantor Equity Partners currently has 10 million Class A shares outstanding and a couple of million Class B shares as well, but it's unclear how all of that will convert to shares of Twenty One. For simplicity's sake, I'm going to assume there are around 10 million shares, and those will convert 1 to 1 into XXI shares, as we saw in the table graphic above. There are expected to be 371 million shares outstanding in the new entity, Twenty One Capital. Of the SPAC equity owners, they will receive 10 million shares of the 371 million shares outstanding, or in this case, a 1 to 1 conversion. If that is in fact what happens, each CEP share will be worth ~$25/share, assuming a total valuation of $9.2 billion ($9.2 billion/371 million shares). In the past month, Cantor Equity Partners' price has declined from its all-time high near $55 per share down to around $30 per share. This has it approaching a similar MNAV valuation as Strategy...around two times. Risks The risks of buying Cantor Equity Partners are varied. First, you are buying a Bitcoin treasury company that will have a pure exposure to owning Bitcoin. If you don't want to own Bitcoin, then owning shares of Cantor Equity Partners won't be advisable. Second, we don't have insight into the strategy of the new company, Twenty One Capital. If you buy Cantor Equity Partners today, then you are buying it blindly with the expectation that they will successfully implement their strategy to acquire more Bitcoin per share. And it is certainly possible and even likely that they do, but we don't have insight into how they plan to do that at the moment. Third, although the conversion ratio of Cantor Equity Partners shares is approximately expected to be 1 to 1, we won't know exactly how the conversion will look until after the merger takes place. Will the conversion ratio be 1 to 1, or will it be something less than that. Fourth, as we wait for the merger to finalize, Bitcoin might appreciate significantly, but with a certain degree of unknowns surrounding the merger, Cantor Equity Partners may fail to appreciate in price as fully as an established Bitcoin treasury company like Strategy. This represents an opportunity cost that is present with any investment. Conclusion I would consider Cantor Equity Partners as a hold for the moment. If you already own shares, I would not sell, but it might be prudent to wait for the conversion into XXI shares to get a better idea of the value proposition. I think the new shares of XXI will be worth researching to understand their strategy to increase shareholder returns in Bitcoin terms. The company will have a very impressive list of shareholders, which could come together to create compelling value as they find creative ways to bring Bitcoin to new and existing capital markets. As an alternative strategy to buying Cantor Equity Partners, one might hold Strategy shares until the merger takes place and convert shares into XXI shares after the merger. But for now, I rate Cantor Equity Partners a hold.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800150-cantor-equity-partners-waiting-on-merger-with-twenty-one-capital?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS|SPONSORED","CEP",cryptocompare
2025-07-09T14:39:09,"Whales That Started the Previous Ethereum Bull Run Are Back in Action! What Does It Mean for ETH?","Ethereum (ETH) has been more prominent than Bitcoin (BTC) in recent days. At this point, as institutions are rapidly switching from Bitcoin to ETH, million-dollar purchases are coming one after another. This suggests that Ethereum is gaining bullish momentum amid rising institutional inflows. Cryptocurrency market analysis firm 10X Research has noted in its new analysis that Ethereum is currently trading above both its 7-day and 30-day moving averages, indicating strong bullish momentum. ETH gained 3.6% last week, driven by $148.5 million in ETF inflows. BlackRock’s spot ETH ETF ETHA remains the market leader with $4.6 billion in assets under management (AUM). In other news, BitMine Immersion Technologies raised $250 million to implement an ETH-based treasury strategy, while SharpLink Gaming recently purchased $22.8 million worth of ETH, a sign of growing institutional demand and renewed investor confidence. Related News: Ethereum's MicroStrategy Receives ETH Purchase Again From Nasdaq-Listed Company! ""Retains Its Position as the World's Largest ETH Holder!"" Apart from 10X Research, Glassnode also announced its Ethereum analysis. At this point, Glassnode stated that aggressive whale purchases and the current situation could allow ETH to reach $3.4 thousand by August. Glassnode expects the strong buying frenzy by Ethereum whales to push the ETH price higher, data shows. At this point, the total amount of ETH held by whales holding at least 10,000 ETH increased by 9.31% from 37.56 million in October of last year to 41.06 million as of July 7. These figures also indicate that the pace of accumulation in the May-September 2022 period has almost doubled. At this point, analysts particularly pointed out that whales made similar aggressive purchases between November 2020 and January 2021, the amount of ETH held by whales increased by 4%, and then the ETH price skyrocketed from $ 460 to $ 1,220. *This is not investment advice.

In a new interview posted on the Fundstrat YouTube channel, Lee says that Bitcoin adoption is going to expand massively, and predicts banks will even start holding the flagship crypto asset. “95% of investors have zero Bitcoin exposure. So you’re still way ahead if you’re buying Bitcoin today. If you look at Bitcoin wallets, comparing it to the Internet, we’re back to 1996 levels. The Internet went exponential from 1996. So it’s still the earliest days. I think Bitcoin is very useful, because in the future we’re not going to be able to trust anything. There’s nothing secure anymore. We can sample your voice… You’ll never know what’s true anymore. You need to be able to trust a system. The Bitcoin blockchain is the most trusted blockchain, and that’s why the United States wants to have a million Bitcoin, US companies are buying Bitcoin [and] banks will soon carry Bitcoin as collateral.” Bitcoin is trading for $108,845 at time of writing, flat on the day. Lee also says that Ethereum is likely to surge in value due to the increasing popularity of stablecoins, which mostly operate over the ETH network. “Stablecoins run on Ethereum. As stablecoins explode…Ethereum is the backbone for stablecoins. So I think Ethereum is going to make a big comeback.” Ethereum is trading for $2,608 at time of writing, up 2.9% in the last 24 hours.
