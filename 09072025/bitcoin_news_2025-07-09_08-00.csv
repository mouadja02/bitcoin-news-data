2025-07-09T05:55:07,"Pay Attention to This Date in Bitcoin: Analyst Claims It Marks the Start of a Rally Based on Historical Data","Economist Timothy Peterson pointed out a striking historical pattern regarding the Bitcoin (BTC) market in his assessment. According to Peterson, the period he calls the “Bitcoin Bastille Day Rally” will begin on July 14, which the analyst believes could herald a significant recovery phase for Bitcoin. Peterson, in his analysis based on historical data, noted that in years where Bitcoin underperforms, it typically experiences a strong rally starting around Bastille Day. He explained that this rally typically begins on July 14th and lasts until July 30th, noting that this two-week period is a critical time for Bitcoin to recoup its losses from the year. Related News: The Country Where Tether (USDT) Is Keeping Tons of Its Gold Has Been Revealed - Here Are the Details However, this rise also comes with a warning for investors: According to Peterson, the ten-week period following this two-week recovery period stands out as one of the weakest performing periods for Bitcoin historically. Peterson also noted that Bitcoin behaves like a “compressed spring,” arguing that historically, Bitcoin has seen an average rise of at least 16% in positive months. However, this year, this figure has only been 9% so far. This suggests that strong moves above 16% are possible in the coming positive months, according to the analyst. *This is not investment advice.

Price prediction for 2025 suggests a potential high of $32. Long-term forecasts indicate LINK could reach $195 by 2030. Chainlink has emerged as a game-changing decentralized oracle network, enabling smart contracts to connect seamlessly with real-world data, APIs, and traditional financial systems. As the crypto market evolves, Chainlink’s role continues to expand—especially with its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) gaining traction. Its native token, LINK, not only powers the ecosystem but has also caught the attention of investors and analysts. With LINK price showing signs of a potential breakout and strong on-chain fundamentals backing its rise, the big question remains: Can LINK coin price hit $50 in 2025? Let’s dive into this detailed Chainlink price prediction 2025–2030 to find out. Table of Contents Overview Chainlink Price Target July 2025 LINK Price Prediction 2025 Chainlink Price Targets 2026 – 2030 Market Analysis CoinPedia’s Chainlink Price Prediction FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Chainlink Token LINK Price $ 14.07450091 5.84% Market Cap $ 9,543,918,651.3286 Trading Volume $ 360,735,871.9315 Circulating Supply 678,099,970.4528 All-time High $52.88 May 10, 2021 All-time Low $0.1263 Sep 23, 2017 Chainlink Price Target July 2025 In July 2025, Chainlink (LINK) is trying to reverse the decline from mid-May caused by a change in geopolitical factors. The end of June showed bullish reawakening in the short term as LINK price seeks a retest of the $18 neckline. This retest is essential for sustaining its upward momentum. The price is currently trying to stabilize around the $13 mark, and a successful break above the $18 level could signal a bullish trend. But if $13 breaks, then it might pull back to $10. LINK Price Prediction 2025 In 2025, Chainlink (LINK) started the year on a downward path, but by April, the tide began to turn. Early in the month, LINK began its recovery from a low of $10.067. By May, it had formed a bullish rounded bottom pattern, with a crucial neckline set at $18. However, since mid-May, LINK has faced challenges in maintaining its position near this neckline. By the third week of June, it pulled back toward the support level of the rounded bottom, which coincides with a multi-year support zone around $11. In the final week of June, LINK’s price began to rise again, but in past 15-days it is attempting to hold steady near the key $13 mark. If bullish momentum continues, LINK could aim to retest the neckline at $18 in July. For this price advance to sustain itself in the long term, LINK must break above and close daily above the $18 neckline. Such a move could signal a potential upward trend, increasing the chances of retesting the $24 resistance level in Q3 and Q4. This area is supported by a high-volume profile from earlier in the year. If LINK manages to surpass the $24 mark, projections for late 2025 suggest that the token could soar as high as $32.

His testimony emphasizes that XRP is not a security, Ripple holds over 60 global licenses, and U.S. crypto policy is forcing innovation offshore. With the hearing titled “From Wall Street to Web3,” Garlinghouse urges Congress to act, stating, “Money should move like information and XRP is the key.” This marks a major turning point for Ripple, placing XRP at the center of crypto legislation debates. July 9, 2025 05:39:39 UTC XRP Price Could Soar if SEC Ends Ripple Case This Saturday Speculation is mounting that the SEC could announce the end of its case against Ripple this Saturday. If that happens, analysts believe it could signal a coordinated shift, including Fedwire adopting Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) alongside ISO20022 standards. Such a move would align the U.S. financial infrastructure with blockchain-based systems, potentially positioning XRP at the core. Market watchers say this could lead to a massive price breakout for XRP, driven by utility, clarity, and institutional confidence. If true, XRP may soon reach levels the market hasn’t yet imagined. July 9, 2025 05:39:39 UTC XRP ETF Backed by Trump Could Reshape Crypto Investing Trump’s Truth Social is reportedly applying to launch a “Crypto Blue Chip ETF,” featuring XRP, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. This marks a dramatic shift in U.S. political alignment with crypto, especially XRP, which has long faced regulatory pressure. The move could legitimize XRP on Wall Street, offering institutional access and reshaping its narrative. Combined with Ripple’s push for a national bank charter and growing real-world XRPL utility, the ETF may open the door to broader adoption. As power circles embrace XRP, analysts warn its price may not stay retail-level for long.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-xrp-news-today-xrp-price-prediction-xrp-etf-approval-news-ripple-vs-sec-and-more/,"XRP|TRADING|REGULATION|BTC|ETH|MARKET","News|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

2025-07-09T05:30:37,"Bitcoin Volatility Hits Bull Cycle Low – Bollinger Bands Signal Potential Breakout","Bitcoin has remained in a tight consolidation range below its all-time high of $112,000 since late May, frustrating both bulls and bears. Despite multiple failed breakout attempts, BTC has held key demand zones above critical support levels, suggesting strong underlying strength. As price compresses, volatility is declining — a classic sign that a major move could be imminent. Top analyst Axel Adler shared fresh data indicating that Bitcoin is currently experiencing a textbook Bollinger Bands squeeze. The spread between the upper and lower bands has narrowed to just 7.7%, marking one of the tightest ranges seen throughout the current bull cycle. Historically, such compressions have preceded explosive moves in either direction. Given Bitcoin’s position above support and within a broader uptrend, the probability favors an upside breakout. This technical setup, combined with macroeconomic tailwinds and renewed investor interest, could serve as the catalyst for BTC to finally push into price discovery . If confirmed, it would not only open the door for a run beyond $112K but also reset expectations across the crypto market. In the coming days, all eyes will be on how Bitcoin responds to this mounting pressure. Bitcoin Consolidates As Bollinger Bands Squeeze Signals Next Move Bitcoin continues to consolidate just below its all-time high of $112,000, frustrating bulls and bears alike. Despite ongoing resistance at the top, bears have failed to drive the price below $105,000, confirming strong demand at key support levels. As the price tightens, the broader macroeconomic picture adds complexity to the outlook. The US Congress recently passed President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” economic bill just before the July 4 deadline. The package includes tax cuts and aggressive public spending, which are expected to fuel inflation in the coming quarters. Coupled with optimistic job data, these developments are shaping investor sentiment across traditional and crypto markets. On the technical side , Axel Adler highlighted a classic Bollinger Bands squeeze currently forming on Bitcoin’s chart. The range between the upper and lower bands has compressed to just 7.7%—one of the tightest readings seen throughout the ongoing bull cycle. This kind of volatility drop suggests energy accumulation, with the price preparing for a significant move. Historical patterns offer insight: of six major Bollinger Band squeezes this cycle, four resulted in immediate upside moves, and two triggered brief corrections before rallies resumed. With this precedent, Adler believes the current setup most likely foreshadows a bullish breakout, although minor consolidation beforehand is still possible. BTC Price Holds Above Key Moving Averages The 12-hour Bitcoin chart shows BTC trading at $108,892, struggling to break above the key resistance zone around $109,300. This level has acted as a rejection point multiple times since early June, confirming its strength. Despite the recent pullback, price remains above the 50 SMA ($106,442) and 100 SMA ($106,671), indicating bullish momentum is still in play. Importantly, bulls have defended the $106,000–$107,000 support range several times, preventing deeper corrections and keeping BTC within a tight consolidation range. Volume has declined in recent sessions, suggesting the market is waiting for a catalyst to break out of this range. If Bitcoin closes decisively above $109,300 on strong volume, a run toward the $112,000 all-time high becomes increasingly likely. On the downside, a break below the 100 SMA could expose BTC to the next major support around $103,600, a key level that has held since mid-May. The 200 SMA (currently at $99,093) remains a long-term support zone that hasn’t been tested in months.

2025-07-09T05:30:08,"2% Of All XRP Is In His Hands — But Who Is He?","A long‑time figure in the world of digital money and a noted XRP advocate stepped out of the shadows this week, sparking fresh chatter among investors and developers alike. Related Reading: XRP Could Hit $35 If It Captures A Quarter Of Remittance Market By 2029 Arthur Britto, who co‑founded Ripple Labs in 2012, broke a 14‑year silence with a single emoji on X. That tiny message carried big weight. His name rarely surfaces in headlines, but his work helped build XRP into one of the top assets by market value. Impact Of A Secretive Founder According to reports, Britto kept a low profile while helping craft the XRP Ledger’s code. He holds a 2% stake in XRP under a deal made when the company launched. That slice of holdings could be worth billions if the token’s price ever climbed high enough. Some in the market worry that if Britto ever sold even part of that stake, it might send prices tumbling. 🚨⚠️ HE CO-CREATED THE XRP LEDGER. HE HOLDS 2% OF ALL XRP. HE’S NEVER BEEN SEEN IN PUBLIC. Arthur Britto might be the most important figure in crypto you’ve never heard of. Let’s dive into the mystery.🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/xKyiYXIpGY — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) July 5, 2025 The Satoshi Connection Based on reports, comparisons to Bitcoin’s creator have swirled around Britto for years. Some fans point to the fact that Satoshi Nakamoto’s last known post came just as the XRP Ledger went live. That timing alone has led people to whisper that Britto could be Satoshi under a different name. No proof supports that idea. Experts say it’s more likely just a coincidence. Britto’s lone emoji on X was verified by Ripple CTO David Schwartz. That confirmation set off a wave of theories about what might come next. Some speculated a new protocol update. Others thought it hinted at a partnership or a fresh product launch. So far, nothing public has followed the post. Behind The Scenes At PolySign While he stayed away from interviews, Britto never stopped working. He co‑founded PolySign, a crypto custody firm that now operates under Ripple Custody. That arm provides secure storage for institutions holding digital coins. Based on filings, PolySign handled an estimated $1.5 billion in assets last year. Its integration into Ripple’s services shows Britto’s influence lives on, even if his name doesn’t show up on conference schedules. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees $6 Billion In Tokenized Funds As Big Players Jump In Future Moves And Market Watch With XRP trading near its recent range, some investors say they’re watching for any hint of action from Britto’s wallet. Price targets in the community sometimes stretch to $10,000 per XRP. Those figures come without verification, and many traders treat them as wishful thinking. Still, a lot can happen if even a fraction of Britto’s holdings moves.

2025-07-09T05:30:00,"NEW Remixpoint CEO to Be Paid in Bitcoin","Takashi decided to do this to align with shareholders and the firm’s pivot toward a Bitcoin-focused treasury strategy. Remixpoint already holds an impressive digital asset portfolio, including over 1,051 BTC. Meanwhile, Japanese firm Metaplanet intensified its Bitcoin accumulation, and now holds 15,555 BTC with plans to reach 1% of all Bitcoin in existence by 2027. CEO Simon Gerovich envisions using BTC as collateral to fund acquisitions like a digital bank. At the same time, VC firm Ego Death Capital raised $100 million to back Bitcoin-only startups. Takashi Tashiro Accepts Bitcoin Salary Takashi Tashiro, the newly appointed CEO of Tokyo-based energy firm Remixpoint, will receive his salary in Bitcoin, according to a company statement that was released on Tuesday. The company explained that the move aligns with its goal of “shareholder-oriented management” and reflects Tashiro’s commitment to being “in the same boat” as shareholders. Remixpoint said the payment will be calculated in Japanese yen, and once taxes and remuneration are finalized, the equivalent amount in Bitcoin will be purchased and sent to a crypto wallet designated by Tashiro. Statement from Remixpoint Tashiro stepped into the CEO role in June, and stated that Bitcoin will be central to the company’s financial strategy as it pivots toward a treasury management focus. Even before his appointment, Remixpoint was accumulating a large digital asset portfolio. As of June 13, the company held more than 1,051 BTC, 901 ETH, 13,920 SOL, over 1.19 million XRP, and nearly 2.8 million DOGE, with a total market value exceeding $116 million. Takashi Tashiro In addition to leading Remixpoint, Tashiro is also affiliated with BITPoint, a crypto exchange tied to the SBI Group. The exchange recently attracted some attention for promoting the Trump-themed meme coin “Official Trump.” Remixpoint is not the first company to compensate its executives in cryptocurrency. In 2021, Argo Blockchain’s then-CEO Peter Wall opted to receive his salary in Bitcoin after being inspired by NFL player Russell Okung, who converted a portion of his income to crypto in 2020. Similarly, New York City Mayor Eric Adams accepted his first three paychecks in Bitcoin after his 2021 election campaign. Adams frequently boasted about the growth of his crypto holdings, especially since Bitcoin’s price has more than doubled since he first decided to embrace it. Metaplanet Plans Bitcoin-Backed Expansion Another Japanese firm is also grabbing the attention of the crypto space. Metaplanet is continuing its bold strategy of accumulating Bitcoin with the intention of using it as a financial asset to acquire revenue-generating businesses, including the potential purchase of a digital bank in Japan. In an interview with the Financial Times, CEO Simon Gerovich revealed that the company’s long-term vision is to transform its Bitcoin reserves into leverage for future expansion. He described the firm’s strategy as a “Bitcoin gold rush,” due to the urgency to accumulate as much BTC as possible before others can catch up. Gerovich is very confident that once Metaplanet reaches a critical mass of Bitcoin holdings, it will become increasingly difficult for competitors to rival its position. Metaplanet began buying Bitcoin in 2024 as a hedge against inflation. Since then, it has dramatically shifted its business model and now holds 15,555 BTC. The company plans to increase this number to over 210,000 BTC by 2027, which would amount to 1% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist. Gerovich said that once Metaplanet reaches sufficient holdings, it will begin using Bitcoin as collateral to access financing. He even compared it to how companies use traditional securities or government bonds. The plan is to convert this financial flexibility into acquisitions of cash-generating assets, with a strong preference for businesses aligned with its digital-first vision. One of the main targets under consideration is a digital bank in Japan, which would allow Metaplanet to provide next-generation financial services better than current retail offerings. Although crypto-backed lending is still rare in conventional finance, institutional players are slowly entering the space. Standard Chartered and OKX recently piloted a program for institutional crypto collateral. Gerovich stated that Metaplanet will not pursue convertible debt to fund its acquisitions but would consider issuing preferred shares to avoid repayment obligations tied to volatile share prices. On Monday, the company resumed its aggressive buying spree by adding 2,204 BTC for $237 million at an average price of about $107,700 per coin. This raised its total holdings to 15,555 BTC , with an average purchase cost of $99,985 per Bitcoin. Despite limited revenue, Metaplanet’s stock soared more than 330% in 2025, pushing its market capitalization beyond $7 billion. The company’s approach is very similar to that of MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, which now holds over 597,000 BTC and has a market cap of $112 billion. Top public Bitcoin treasury companies (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) VC Firm Backs Bitcoin-Only Startups Meanwhile, venture capital firm Ego Death Capital secured $100 million in funding from family offices and other investors to support early-stage Bitcoin companies. The firm plans to allocate the funds to Series A rounds for startups generating between $1 million and $3 million in annual revenue, according to founding partner Nico Leshuga. Speaking to Axios , Leshuga shared his strong conviction in Bitcoin’s role as a foundational technology, and described it as “the only decentralized and secure base to be able to build on.” Ego Death Capital’s strategic focus comes during a wave of institutional enthusiasm for Bitcoin, fueled by the strong performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States and the growth of corporate Bitcoin treasuries. The firm already invested in several Bitcoin-native startups, including Roxcom, a Bitcoin exchange; Relai, a savings platform; and Breez, a payment app built on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network. However, the firm drew a firm line on the scope of its investments. It does not plan to back hardware-oriented companies like miners or wallet manufacturers, nor is it interested in any projects involving other cryptocurrencies. This narrow focus distinguishes Ego Death Capital from other crypto venture firms. The timing of Ego Death’s new fund coincides with a rebound in venture capital funding in the crypto and blockchain space. According to CryptoRank , the second quarter saw a sharp uptick in funding, with a total of $10.03 billion raised. Over half of that, $5.14 billion, came in June alone. Among the standout deals were Vivek Ramaswamy’s $750 million Strive fundraise and the launch of 21 Capital, which raised $585 million for Bitcoin acquisitions. (Source: CryptoRank ) This resurgence was the strongest quarter for crypto venture capital since the first quarter of 2022, when investment levels reached $16.64 billion. Ego Death Capital’s focused strategy in this specific growing landscape means that it has a deepening belief that Bitcoin is not just a store of value, but a foundational platform for the next wave of innovation.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9855/new-remixpoint-ceo-to-be-paid-in-bitcoin,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Pi Network risks falling below $0.40 if stagnation continues. However, if the Pi Core Team implements just two of these 11 strategic actions, the community could regain confidence, and the price may recover steadily. Key suggestions include launching DAO governance, burning unclaimed tokens, forming partnerships with firms like OpenAI or Binance Cloud, and enabling cross-chain compatibility with Ethereum or BNB. Other actions like mass KYC rollout, introducing DeFi features, reviving node rewards, and funding developers through a Pi Launchpad could significantly boost utility and demand.

2025-07-09T05:13:06,"Ethereum Is Becoming What Treasuries Are to Traditional Finance: Research","“Stablecoins are spreading the dollar faster than any financial tech in history,” said Electric Capital General Partner Maria Shen on Tuesday. “Ethereum is becoming the financial backbone,” she added, referencing a newly published research report on stablecoin demand for Ethereum’s tenth birthday. For the first time, anyone across the globe can hold US dollars via stablecoins, which will drive demand, in turn benefiting Ethereum. The Primary Settlement Layer Despite talk of “de-dollarization,” the global demand for US dollars is booming, especially via stablecoins , which now exceed $260 billion in total market capitalization. This is unlocking dollar access for billions, especially in emerging markets. More than four billion people and millions of businesses are actively seeking dollar access through stablecoins, the researchers noted. Stablecoins are spreading the dollar faster than any financial tech in history. And Ethereum is becoming the financial backbone. For Ethereum’s 10th birthday, we’re publishing our updated @ElectricCapital ETH thesis: Remaking the Case for ETH 1/ pic.twitter.com/Rr9mSrK0GS — mariaa.eth (@MariaShen) July 8, 2025 However, this burgeoning market of new dollar holders wants more than just digital cash. They need yields , investment opportunities, and financial services, and traditional finance, such as banks, cannot serve this massive new market due to regulatory, financial, geofencing, and infrastructure constraints. “Ethereum is uniquely positioned to host the global financial infrastructure for this new digital dollar economy, and ETH stands to benefit directly from this growth.” Ethereum is already primed for this position because it is globally accessible, institution-grade secure, and resistant to government interference. Additionally, Ethereum is already the primary settlement layer, underpinning the largest on-chain economy with more than $140 billion in stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets and $60 billion in DeFi. As a result, Ethereum will become to the on-chain dollar economy what Treasuries and gold are to traditional finance – a reserve and trust anchor. As stablecoin usage expands, a flywheel effect will be generated as more ETH is needed as collateral for DeFi and real-world finance, more ETH is staked, securing the network and reducing supply, and more institutional capital flows in , as the asset offers regulatory clarity and composability. No Real Competition There is no real competition at the moment because Bitcoin lacks programmability and adoption as a financial platform, and other blockchains lack Ethereum’s security, decentralization, and institutional credibility, they said. Additionally, traditional finance is geographically and regulatorily siloed and unable to serve the global demand unlocked by stablecoins. Anyone who has tried to open a bank account in a particular country without a physical address there would concur. “We’ve believed in programmable money since 2018. We made the institutional case for Bitcoin at our founding. Now we’re doing the same for Ethereum,” said Shen in conclusion.

2025-07-09T05:12:07,"Bitcoin Price at a Critical Turning Point: Analysis Company Shares Its Predictions","In its latest report evaluating the technical outlook of Bitcoin (BTC), cryptocurrency analysis firm MakroVision stated that the largest cryptocurrency has reached a critical threshold. While the analysis noted that Bitcoin has formed a strong structure in recent weeks, it was claimed that a breakout in the short term could determine the direction. According to MakroVision’s technical analysis, Bitcoin price is currently approaching the red trend line that has been acting as a strong resistance for weeks. Above this level, there is a high amount of liquidity in the $111,000–$112,000 range. Related News: The Hidden Danger in the Cryptocurrency World: Could This be the Second Terra (LUNA) Incident? On the support side, two main areas stand out: The $106,400–$107,400 range is being watched as short-term support. The $105,000–$102,000 band below this level is defined as a larger demand zone. MakroVision states that if Bitcoin achieves a permanent break above the $110,000 level, a new upward momentum may begin. However, in case of a rejection from this level, the reaction of the price and whether the support zones can be maintained will be decisive in terms of the direction of the market. *This is not investment advice.

Why Does the M2 to Bitcoin Ratio Matter? What Could This Mean for Investors? FAQs Introduction In its June 2025 Bitcoin Monthly Report , global asset manager ARK Invest has revealed a striking milestone for Bitcoin’s scarcity narrative. The ratio of global M2 money supply to Bitcoin supply has reached its highest point in 12 years — highlighting how Bitcoin’s fixed supply continues to contrast with expanding global liquidity. What Did ARK Invest Reveal? According to ARK Invest’s official report ( source ), each Bitcoin now represents about $5.7 million of global M2 money supply . This is the highest ratio seen since Bitcoin’s early years. Key details from the report: Record Ratio: The global M2 supply is growing, while Bitcoin’s issuance rate keeps dropping due to its halving cycle. Future Outlook: ARK expects this ratio to keep climbing as Bitcoin’s supply growth shrinks further. Scarcity Signal: With less new Bitcoin entering circulation, its role as a hedge against fiat currency dilution strengthens. Why Does the M2 to Bitcoin Ratio Matter? Many investors track the M2-to-Bitcoin ratio to understand Bitcoin’s relative scarcity against global liquidity: M2 Supply: Represents cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near-money — a core measure of global money supply. Bitcoin’s Cap: Unlike fiat currencies, Bitcoin’s total supply is capped at 21 million coins , with the last Bitcoin expected to be mined around 2140. Implication: Rising M2 + fixed Bitcoin = each Bitcoin theoretically absorbs more global liquidity over time. As Cathie Wood , CEO of ARK Invest, has often stated, Bitcoin could act as a hedge against monetary debasement when central banks expand liquidity ( source ). What Could This Mean for Investors? Here are three takeaways for Bitcoin investors and analysts: Potential Store of Value: A higher M2 ratio supports the thesis that Bitcoin’s scarcity could protect wealth long-term. Macro Hedge: Some view Bitcoin as an alternative to gold when fiat supply expands aggressively. Caution Required: Volatility remains — investors should balance enthusiasm with prudent risk management. For related trends, see [Link to related internal page]. FAQs Q1: Who is ARK Invest? ARK Invest is a global investment firm founded by Cathie Wood, known for its focus on disruptive innovation and in-depth research reports. Q2: What is the M2 money supply? M2 includes physical cash, checking accounts, and easily liquid assets — it’s a standard measure of how much money circulates in an economy. Q3: How does Bitcoin’s supply limit work? Bitcoin’s supply is hard-coded to a maximum of 21 million coins. New coins are released through mining rewards, which halve approximately every four years.

2025-07-09T04:30:56,"Bitcoin Absorbs Strong Selling Pressure On Binance Derivatives – Breakout Ahead?","Bitcoin (BTC) has remained range-bound between $100,000 and $110,000 since May 7, aside from a few dips to as low as $98,000 in June, which were quickly followed by daily candle closes above the $100,000 level. Recent analysis reveals that BTC has withstood sustained selling pressure on Binance Derivatives throughout this period. Bitcoin Withstands Binance Derivatives Sell-Off According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor BorisVest, taker users on Binance Derivatives have consistently engaged in sell-side activity for at least the past 45 days. Notably, the Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) has remained negative throughout this time. For the uninitiated, the CVD measures the net difference between market buy – aggressive buying – and market sell – aggressive selling – orders over time. It helps traders identify whether buying or selling pressure is dominating, even if price remains stable. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Floor Rises Toward $100,000, Reinforcing Bullish Sentiment BorisVest noted that Binance Derivatives traders are treating each BTC bounce or rally as a selling opportunity, opening aggressive short positions via market sell orders. However, this strong sell pressure has failed to push prices lower, as BTC continues to absorb the selling activity and maintain support above $100,000. The analyst added that as long as BTC remains within its current range – between $100,000 and $110,000 – while absorbing sell pressure, the potential for upside remains intact. He explained: The CVD metric plays a crucial role here. It aggregates both taker and maker activity to provide a real-time picture of net buy/sell pressure. The fact that CVD remains in decline confirms the dominance of sell-side flow. Yet, the inability of price to drop further despite this pressure may signal that Bitcoin is being absorbed by institutional or large players in the background. That said, other analysts interpret the persistent selling pressure differently. For example, fellow CryptoQuant analyst Crazzyblockk recently observed that new buyer demand is struggling to keep pace with the combined supply pressure from newly mined BTC and selling by long-term holders. BTC Eyeing A Breakout Ahead? Bitcoin’s resilience in the face of heavy selling on Binance Derivatives has once again sparked speculation about a potential breakout. Several additional data points suggest that BTC may be poised to move into a higher price range soon. Related Reading: Bitcoin Forming Inverse Head And Shoulders Pattern – Is $150,000 The Next Target? For instance, recent on-chain data shows that “weak hands” are offloading their BTC holdings to larger, more established investors – indicating a broader shift in sentiment favoring Bitcoin. Meanwhile, institutional interest in the asset continues to grow. Additionally, the Bitcoin Yearly Percentage Trend suggests that BTC could top out around $205,000 by the end of 2025. At press time, BTC trades at $108,589, up 0.4% in the past 24 hours.

2025-07-09T04:29:30,"Elon Musk’s post criticizing the justice system drew attention to Solana’s PNUT token","Billionaire Elon Musk’s X post drew attention to Solana’s Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) token, which has so far climbed more than 10% in price in just 24 hours. In his Tuesday post, Musk bashed the government for failing to take action against people on the Epstein client list , including a meme mocking the justice system. The meme insinuated that more squirrels and raccoons than Epstein’s affiliates have been apprehended. Crypto traders tied Musk’s post to Solana’s PNUT token Musk also mentioned a squirrel named Peanut, who was “arrested (and killed), in his post. While he didn’t name the PNUT token explicitly, the timing of his post coincided with a spike in the coin’s price and trading activity. Source: CoinMarketCap He wrote, “They arrested (and killed) Peanut but have not even tried to file charges against anyone on the Epstein client list. Government is deeply broken.” So far, the post has over 13.7 million views, earning nearly 45% of the views in just a few hours. Crypto investors seem to have associated his post with the Solana meme coin. After his post, the PNUT token surged 10% to $0.2357. The asset’s 24-hour trading volume also grew 80%, crossing $214 million. Currently, the meme coin has a market cap of $223 million, trading at $0.2257. Musk’s past posts have fueled crypto price rallies This is not the first time Musk’s posts have driven price rallies for crypto assets. In January, he changed his handle on X to “Kekius Maximus” and profile picture to show “Pepe the Frog” in Roman military attire, holding a video game joystick. After his alteration, the Kekius Maximus token surged over 900% . In 2021, Musk wrote, “The Dogefather SNL May 8” in one of his posts, and Dogecoin, a popular meme coin, rose over 20% in 24 hours. Then again, in 2024, he posted an AI image related to the token, causing another price rise for the token by about 8%. Additionally, in January 2021, he changed his bio on the platform to #bitcoin. Soon after, Bitcoin’s price jumped from roughly $32,000 to more than $38,000, adding $111 billion to its market cap. Moreover, the Ethereum-based meme coin Floki rose 418% after the billionaire posted a picture of his dog named Floki in 2023. Judging from history, Musk’s meme and crypto-related posts, no matter how subtle, tend to spark swift reactions in the crypto market. In this case, a satirical political reference propelled a Solana meme token upward, but whether the token can grow more hinges on future hype and traction. Musk is hoping to establish a new political party Meanwhile, the billionaire is focused on building a third party that could rival the Republican and Democratic parties. Following his fallout with President Trump over the ‘Big Beautiful Bill,’ Musk disclosed the birth of the American Party. He’s touted the new party as tech-driven, fiscally responsible, energy-friendly, and politically centrist, aiming to attract both Democrats and Republicans alike. However, experts have warned that disbanding the grip of the traditional parties demands significant funding and long-term dedication. They noted how previous attempts failed, especially since elections in the country are at a state-by-state level. However, some are optimistic that Musk could pull through with his new party, including David Jolly, a former Republican congressman from Florida. Jolly believes the challenge in forming a new party is having resources, noting that Musk could provide that. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The proposed investment trust will primarily hold Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) , Solana (SOL) , Ripple (XRP) , and Cronos (CRO) , the native token of the Cronos blockchain, which is associated with the Crypto.com exchange. The SEC has acknowledged the filing, which means it’s now under review, according to a July 8 SEC submission. Source: Sec.gov Truth Social ETF Portfolio Structure and Crypto.com partnership The ETF portfolio will maintain a composition of approximately 70% Bitcoin , 15% Ethereum , 8% Solana , 5% Cronos , and 2% XRP by value. Upon approval, the ETF will be listed and traded on NYSE Arca, though the fund’s ticker symbol remains undisclosed. ""the Trust’s allocation of its assets to the Portfolio Assets (the “allocation ratio”) is initially expected to approximate percentages by value of 70% bitcoin, 15% ether, 8% SOL, 5% CRO and 2% XRP."" — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 8, 2025 The proposed ETF is expected to function as a passive investment vehicle, tracking the market prices of its underlying cryptocurrencies without employing leverage, derivatives, or speculative trading strategies. The fund will also engage in staking for assets such as Ethereum, Solana, and Cronos, allowing it to generate staking rewards. Truth Social previously filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF in June, followed by a submission for a Bitcoin and Ethereum combination ETF. Similar to those registration statements, the “Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF” is sponsored by Yorkville America Digital, while Foris DAX Trust Company will be serving as custodian for digital assets, according to the filing. Additionally, Crypto.com will act as the ETF’s exclusive Bitcoin custodian, prime execution agent, and liquidity provider. Earlier reports indicated a TMTG partnership with Singapore-based Crypto.com to launch “Made-in-America” ETFs. The media platform signed a non-binding agreement to offer a series of exchange-traded products (ETPs) and funds (ETFs) on the Cronos blockchain-owned exchange. The inclusion of CRO in the investable ETFs appears to confirm Crypto.com’s involvement in the venture. Notably, the news of the recent filing had a notably greater impact on CRO than on other Truth Social blue-chip cryptocurrencies. The asset surged more than 20% to a monthly high of $0.09886, while Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana only experienced gains between 1.08% and 3.6% during the same period. Source: Coingecko TMTG’s Broader Digital Asset Strategy Amid President Trump’s Growing Crypto Fortune The SEC’s potential approval follows the confirmation by Truth Social’s parent company of its digital asset strategy, which includes a Bitcoin treasury plan. On May 30, the company announced it had raised $2.44 billion through a private placement involving nearly 50 institutional investors. The SEC has approved Trump Media and Technology Group’s (TMTG) registration statement linked to a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury initiative. #Trump #TruthSocial https://t.co/ybidUAZtqb — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 14, 2025 The funding round included 55.9 million shares at $25.72 and $1 billion in zero-coupon convertible notes, with proceeds designated for Bitcoin acquisition and general operations. In a May 27 announcement, TMTG President and CEO Devin Nunes described Bitcoin as “an apex instrument of financial freedom,” stating that it would become a core component of the company’s asset base. On the same day, Arkham Intelligence posted on X: “Donald Trump’s company, Trump Media, will buy $2.5 BILLION of Bitcoin. Is Trump about to go Saylor Mode?”, referencing MicroStrategy’s executive chairman and his aggressive Bitcoin strategy. Moreover, President Trump appears to be benefiting significantly from these cryptocurrency ventures. A July 2 Bloomberg report revealed that Trump and his family have reportedly earned over $620 million from recent cryptocurrency ventures, with Trump’s exclusive crypto holdings now comprising around 9% of his estimated $6 billion fortune as of June.

2025-07-09T03:43:26,"Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, XRP ETFs See Record AUM as Traders Warn of ‘Summer Lull’","Bitcoin (BTC) is holding firm near $108,700 even as traditional markets recoil from renewed trade tensions sparked by Donald Trump. The U.S. President signaled plans to hike tariffs on imports, potentially as high as 50%, citing ongoing friction with the European Union over tech regulations. The rhetoric sent asian equities lower for a third time in four sessions, pushed copper futures down in London, and dragged U.S. equity futures into the red. Yet bitcoin remained largely unfazed, suggesting crypto investors are either discounting the macro noise or viewing BTC as increasingly insulated from global policy risk, some opined. “Bitcoin’s slight price drop from Trump's tariff plans showcases the digital asset's resilient nature and long-term investor confidence,” said Han Xu, Director at HashKey Capital, said in a Telegram message. “We’re optimistic this trend will continue even amid short-term volatility.” Still, there's clear hesitation at these levels. “Buyers are quickly letting off steam,” noted FxPro’s Alex Kuptsikevich. “BTC keeps getting pushed down near $110K, and while the 50-day moving average is attracting dip buyers, sellers are just as active.” He added that overall market capitalization, while still up 1.8% on the week, slipped 0.6% in the past 24 hours to $3.35 trillion, signaling another “bout of indecision” at the top. That choppiness persists even as crypto ETF inflows continue. CoinShares reported its 12th consecutive week of net inflows, with nearly $1 billion entering crypto funds last week, and over $790 million of that amount going into bitcoin. Ether(ETH)-tracked products brought in $226 million, Solana's SOL (SOL) $22 million, and XRP (XRP) $11 million. Total ETF assets under management have reached an all-time high of $188 billion. But under the hood, there are signs of fatigue. Bitcoin’s on-chain activity and implied volatility have dropped to their lowest in nearly two years, according to The Block. Glassnode called it a “summer lull,” pointing to collapsing trading volumes and a rising concentration of unrealized gains among long-term holders, or factors that could trigger a sharper move if sentiment turns. Despite the lack of momentum, markets remain firmly risk-on, just nervously so. “Capital continues to move away from the 200-day moving average,” Kuptsikevich added, “which shows the market still leans bullish. But any shift in tone could lead to quick profit-taking.”",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/09/bitcoin-ether-solana-xrp-etfs-see-record-aum-as-traders-warn-of-summer-lull,"BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|XRP","Markets|Markets|Bitcoin|ETF|Solana|Ether|XRP|market analysis|News",cryptocompare

2025-07-09T03:00:12,"Bitcoin Bull Flag Breakout Confirmed — What Happens Next?","Bitcoin has broken out of the orange bull flag on the 1-hour chart. After consolidating within a tight range, the breakout suggests that momentum is shifting back in favor of the bulls, and potentially setting the stage for a rapid push toward higher resistance levels. Pullback Or Launchpad? What Bitcoin’s Next Move Could Look Like According to MaxFINEancial’s latest analysis on X, he highlighted that a large green double bottom is forming within an orange bull flag on the 1-hour chart, which is a bullish continuation setup. Related Reading: Bitcoin Heating Up? NVT Golden Cross Hints At Potential Local Top The local high was a test of the trigger line of the double bottom, which signaled intent from the bulls. BTC is retesting the upper edge of the bull flag, aligning with the 1-hour 200-day MA, a critical dynamic support level that often dictates short-term momentum. MaxFINEancial projects a small pink bullish pennant forming and setting up for a continuation move higher. However, a rare diamond top pattern could also be taking shape, a bearish reversal formation that, if validated, may trigger a sharp downside move. If BTC loses the 1-hour 200-day MA, he advises shifting focus to the 4-hour 200-day MA, which is the line of defense. The important bullish area targets are $113,700, $115,867, $117,030, and $122,143, while the bearish diamond top target is $103,079. Market analyst A_y has also highlighted that Bitcoin is consolidating below the $110,000 resistance on the 4-hour chart, with the structure forming a textbook ascending triangle. This setup is the rising higher lows against horizontal resistance that precedes a strong breakout. If BTC manages to break above $110,000, the move could accelerate toward the $112,000 to $114,000 range, marking a bullish trend. However, failure to breach this ceiling may lead to a pullback toward $104,000, where previous demand has stepped in. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is neutral, suggesting that there is room for momentum to build, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a bullish crossover, that is hinting at potential upward momentum, BTC is still trading below the EMA, which means bulls need to prove strength for a confirmed breakout. Bitcoin Stable At $108,000 — Market Cooling, Not Crashing In an update on X, Chad_TattoosMD also emphasized that Bitcoin is showing resilience and holding strong around the $108,000 level despite the recent dip. BTC is maintaining its structure and refusing to break lower, which is a sign of underlying buyer confidence. Related Reading: Bitcoin Traders Are Betting Against the Rally, Will It Backfire? The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at neutral 54, indicating no extreme momentum in either direction. Meanwhile, the Stochastic (RSI) has entered overbought territory and is now cooling off, hinting at a potential short-term pullback. However, nothing on the chart suggests a breakdown is imminent. Chad_TattoosMD also points to $106,000 as the key support, and $112,000 as the resistance, which remains in a tight zone on the chart.

2025-07-09T01:31:08,"Hype fades as NFT platforms lose users","The NFT market has reached its lowest point in a year and a half, suggesting a long winter in digital collectibles ahead. Their sales volume fell to $823 million in the second quarter of 2025, down from $4 billion over the same period in 2024, according to a new report by DappRadar. That’s a 19% drop from the first quarter of this year and the fifth consecutive quarterly decline. This ongoing bust paints a bleak picture for digital collectible investors and creators. So far, 2025 is the worst year in NFT history, with no real recovery prospects. Nearly every part of the industry is reeling from the steep drop, from well-established collections such as Bored Ape Yacht Club to newer and smaller projects vying to prove their worth and utility. There are several reasons behind the decline, experts say. Interest has waned among the retail traders who, in recent months, flocked to digital collectibles in search of a quick buck. High gas fees on Ethereum, dwindling media buzz, and increasing skepticism about the long-term value of NFTs haven’t helped, either. In other words, fewer people buy, sell, or talk about digital collectibles. Hype fades as NFT platforms lose users NFTs came crashing into the mainstream in 2021 and 2022. They made millionaires overnight from artists and spawned a new generation of digital collectors. Landmark sales, most notably the Beeple auction at Christie’s , which took in $69 million, made headlines around the globe. In this golden age, trading volume in digital collectibles soared past $50 billion a year, and some crude cartoon images changed hands for more than $500,000 apiece. But the gold rush didn’t go on forever. But just as rapidly as NFTs ascended, they began to tumble. Prices began to tumble in mid-2022, erasing billions in value. Collections that once commanded high-profile attention now sell for a fraction of their peak prices. Numerous investors are now left clutching essentially worthless assets. The decline in traffic and trading activity has impacted even major NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, once the dominant platform for collectors. Others, including LooksRare and Blur, are dangling heavy incentives to keep users to little avail. Not even bands and celebrities that were once most aggressively promoting digital collectibles — from basketball players to internet stars — are making much noise. Many projects launched during the hype period are either dead or claimed to be scams. With buyer sentiment down, the mood around digital collectibles has turned to cautious optimism and even skepticism. Trump launches NFTs but fails to revive market And one of the last high-profile figures still pushing digital collectibles is the US president, Donald Trump. Since taking the political stage again, he has released four NFT collections, all dedicated to bold and sometimes humorous interpretations of himself, images of himself in superhero outfits, clutching gold bars, or even appearing to hug the cryptocurrency Bitcoin symbolically. Each of his prior releases has sold out within hours. Trump also held a special NFT holders ’ dinner in 2023 that attracted a lot of media coverage. The NFT drops have become part of his fundraising strategy, a mishmash of politics, pop culture, and crypto. But even Trump’s celebrity draw hasn’t reversed the broader tide. The Bitwise Blue-Chip NFT Collections Index, which measures the performance of top NFT art and collectible projects, has dropped 52% since January 2024, when Trump’s re-election campaign started to heat up. This tells us that though stock drops from new infections may cause an initial blip of interest, they don’t seem to move markets back sustainably. Meanwhile, other segments of the crypto space are proving more resilient. Meanwhile, Bitcoin and Ethereum rebounded in price in 2024 thanks to institutional investment and optimism around exchange-traded funds (ETFs). But NFTs have not benefited from that bounce.

2025-07-09T01:30:36,"ERC-20 Stablecoin Supply Hits All-Time High At $121B – Liquidity On The Rise","While Bitcoin struggles to break above its all-time high and altcoins face difficulty finding solid support, one corner of the crypto market continues to expand: stablecoins. Since the beginning of the bull run, the stablecoin market has shown consistent growth, cementing its reputation as one of crypto’s most reliable and scalable use cases. Unlike volatile assets, stablecoins offer stability, liquidity, and utility across DeFi, trading, and settlement. Related Reading: Ethereum Range Tightens – Liquidity Looms At $2,800 And $2,350 Top analyst Darkfost recently shared fresh data and highlighted a key development many have overlooked — the total supply of ERC-20 stablecoins is rising again. As of today, it has reached a new all-time high of $121 billion. This milestone signals renewed demand and liquidity entering the crypto ecosystem, at a time when other sectors appear stagnant. The rise in stablecoin supply underscores the sector’s resilience and importance. While speculative tokens face resistance, stablecoins thrive on utility and adoption. Whether for hedging, yield strategies, or capital movement, their role in crypto remains foundational. As the broader market waits for its next move, the silent growth in stablecoin supply could be an early signal of renewed momentum across the board. The stablecoin narrative is far from over — in fact, it may just be starting. Stablecoin Growth Accelerates: On-Chain Data Points To Renewed Liquidity Stablecoins have emerged as one of the most impactful innovations in crypto, creating a vital bridge between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). This narrative gained massive traction in June when Circle (NASDAQ: CRCL), the company behind USDC, went public on the New York Stock Exchange. Initially priced at $31 per share, Circle’s IPO exceeded all expectations — closing the day at $82.84, marking a 167% gain. Today, CRCL trades nearly six times above its IPO price, giving the company a $42 billion market cap and reinforcing confidence in the stablecoin business model. On-chain insights shared by Darkfost add another layer to the story. According to the data, the total supply of ERC-20 stablecoins has started rising again and just hit a new all-time high of $121 billion. ERC-20 stablecoins are cryptocurrencies built on the Ethereum blockchain that follow the ERC-20 token standard. They are designed to maintain a stable value, usually pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar (e.g., USDC, USDT, DAI). This surge in supply is critical because stablecoins are minted on demand — their issuance directly reflects user demand and fresh liquidity entering the system. This expanding supply meets the needs of protocols and exchanges that face rising user activity and capital inflows. While market sentiment remains cautious, if the stablecoin supply continues to grow, it would signal renewed risk appetite and capital deployment. In that case, stablecoins may once again serve as the early catalyst for the next major phase in the crypto bull cycle. Related Reading: Altcoins Set A Higher Low – Bulls Target 2024 High To Trigger Altseason Dominance Hovers Below 8%: A Neutral Yet Strategic Positioning The weekly chart shows stablecoin dominance currently sitting at 7.90%, a level that reflects cautious but sustained interest in liquidity reserves across the crypto market. After a sharp climb between 2020 and mid-2022—when stablecoin dominance peaked above 16% during risk-off periods—dominance has gradually declined, aligning with risk-on rotations into Bitcoin and altcoins during bull runs. However, since early 2024, dominance has consolidated between 7% and 10%, signaling a more balanced environment. The current level remains just above the 50-week and 100-week moving averages (7.76% and 8.02%, respectively), suggesting strong horizontal support. Meanwhile, the 200-week moving average at 9.30% acts as a long-term ceiling. Related Reading: Ethereum Risks Downside If Resistance Holds: $2,700 Level Is Critical This neutral position implies that market participants are neither fully risk-on nor risk-off. If dominance rises from here, it could either reflect increased fear (capital flowing out of volatile assets) or fresh liquidity entering the market, especially if paired with a rise in stablecoin supply, which we’re already witnessing with ERC-20 tokens.

2025-07-09T01:30:00,"ReserveOne adds crypto insiders and ex-Trump official to board","ReserveOne, a new crypto startup backed by big names from both traditional finance and Washington, plans to go public on the Nasdaq through a deal with M3-Brigade Acquisition V Corp, a blank-check firm listed under MBAV.O, according to Reuters. The merger is expected to close sometime between October and December this year, and the company is aiming to raise over $1 billion in the process. The company says it will manage a crypto portfolio that includes bitcoin, ethereum, and Solana, and plans to align its strategy with the U.S. strategic crypto reserve. The entire push is part of a broader effort to package crypto into equity to make it more appealing to institutional investors. The idea isn’t new. Michael Saylor’s company, MicroStrategy, did something similar in 2020 when it switched to a bitcoin-centered model and saw its stock price explode. ReserveOne is following that same model but throwing in more firepower from the top. ReserveOne adds crypto insiders and ex-Trump official to board Jaime Leverton, who previously ran crypto mining company Hut 8, is leading ReserveOne as CEO. Jaime said the firm’s upper-level team stands out because of its deep ties to finance, regulation, and crypto. “Our management team and anticipated board of directors bring a really unique pedigree and diversity of background between Wall Street and regulatory and crypto,” she told Reuters. Sebastian Bea, who previously held senior roles at BlackRock and Coinbase Asset Management, will take over as president and lead investment strategy. The board will be chaired by Reeve Collins, one of the co-founders of Tether, the largest stablecoin company. It’ll also include Chinh Chu, formerly at Blackstone, and Wilbur Ross, the former U.S. Secretary of Commerce under President Donald Trump. Jaime said Wilbur was skeptical of crypto at first but “over the last number of months, he’s really opened up to this space.” ReserveOne says it will not only hold crypto but also put it to work. The company plans to lend out assets and stake them to earn regular payouts. This institutional staking model is already common in crypto, but ReserveOne thinks doing it as a public company makes it more credible to larger investors. Backing this entire deal are two well-known crypto companies, Kraken and Blockchain.com, who are putting in up to $750 million in combined equity and convertible debt. The blank-check structure gives ReserveOne a shortcut to the public markets, skipping the longer traditional IPO route. Blank-check firms like M3-Brigade are shell companies that raise funds first and then look for a private firm to merge with. Once the deal is complete, the private company becomes publicly listed. That’s how ReserveOne is landing on the Nasdaq. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

2025-07-09T01:29:25,"Asia Morning Briefing: Bitcoin Stalls Near $109K as Market Waits for a Catalyst","Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins its Wednesday trading day, bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade rangebound without any dominant market-moving headlines. The world's largest digital asset is trading above $108,900, according to CoinDesk market data , and the CoinDesk 20 index, a measure of the performance of the largest digital assets, is above 3,100, up 1.7%. Right now, what separates bitcoin's drift to $110K from a rally is market conviction, say observers. In a recent report, Glassnode highlighted that spot volumes for BTC continue to linger below their usual statistical bands, ETF flows contracted sharply from recent highs, and institutional investors appear hesitant despite the climbing unrealized gains shown in elevated ETF Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratios. In a market update from earlier this week, Wintermute describes this cautious environment as a ""barbell market,"" pointing out a stark divide between renewed enthusiasm in high-beta assets, like memecoins, and the stability of established large-cap tokens. Last year's narrative darlings, notably AI and DePIN tokens, have lost investor attention, indicating that traders are rotating into memecoins, many of the majors like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE are up over 8% in the last week, or staying in BTC and ETH, which are seen as battle-tested and secure. With global equities largely shrugging off geopolitical uncertainties, BTC's hesitancy underscores lingering caution among traders, suggesting the market awaits clearer signals before breaking decisively higher. Things are likely to remain rangebound until that changes. News Recap: $100M Fund Backs Builders, Not Bettors, on Bitcoin Bitcoin-only VC firm Ego Death Capital has closed a $100 million second fund aimed at backing projects that treat Bitcoin as infrastructure, not a speculative trade, CoinDesk previously reported . The fund will target Series A rounds between $3 million and $8 million for startups solving real-world problems using Bitcoin’s base layer or its scaling solutions. “We’re investing in businesses that treat Bitcoin not as a trade, but as infrastructure—something to build on, not bet on,” said general partner Lyn Alden. Ego’s existing portfolio includes Relai, a self-custody app, and Roxom, a securities exchange built directly on Bitcoin rails. At a time when multichain VCs are chasing yield on every new L2 and L3, Ego’s thesis is a bet on simplicity and durability: Bitcoin’s dominance remains above 60%, and the fund aims to capitalize on its staying power. The message to allocators: ignore the hype, back the rails that last. News Recap: Judge Bars Sanctions Talk in Tornado Cash Trial, Limits Free Speech Defense A federal judge has ruled that the U.S. government's sanctions against Tornado Cash, which were imposed in 2022 and later overturned, cannot be discussed in the upcoming criminal trial of developer Roman Storm, CoinDesk previously reported . Judge Katherine Polk Failla said allowing the jury to hear about the now-invalid sanctions would require ""mental gymnastics"" and risk confusing the core legal issues at trial. The sanctions were originally imposed by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) over alleged use of the mixer by North Korea’s Lazarus Group, but were struck down earlier this year in a separate case, Van Loon v. Treasury . Storm faces multiple criminal charges related to his role in building Tornado Cash, a privacy tool that allows users to obscure the origin of crypto transactions. Prosecutors allege that he profited substantially from the project, citing evidence of multi-million-dollar TORN token sales and real estate purchases. Judge Failla also ruled that evidence obtained from fellow Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev’s phone can be admitted at trial, despite objections from Storm’s legal team who argued the material was cherry-picked and not independently verifiable. Although Storm is free to speak about his belief in privacy and civil liberties, the judge said he will not be allowed to frame his actions as protected under the First Amendment. The court drew a distinction between personal beliefs and legal defenses. A final pre-trial hearing is scheduled for Friday, with the trial slated to begin on June 14 and expected to last four weeks. The outcome of the case is likely to set an important precedent for how U.S. courts treat developers of open-source privacy tools. Market Movements: BTC : Bitcoin maintained institutional-grade resilience during the July 7–8 trading cycle, holding above the key $108,000 level while navigating heavy resistance at $109,200 and finding strategic support near $107,470, signaling continued confidence from corporate treasuries despite late-session profit-taking, according to CoinDesk's market insights bot. ETH: Ethereum rose 3% to $2,610 during the July 7–8 session as institutional investors deployed $515 million in coordinated weekend buying, driving volumes to nearly triple the average and pushing the asset through key resistance levels Gold: Gold fell 1.2% to below $3,300 on Tuesday as optimism over delayed reciprocal tariffs and hopes for new trade deals weakened safe-haven demand, while markets awaited FOMC minutes for further rate guidance. Nikkei 225: Asian markets traded mixed Wednesday as Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged down 8.39 points (0.021%) after U.S. President Trump ruled out delaying August 1 tariffs, imposed a 50% duty on copper imports, and warned of potential 200% pharmaceutical tariffs with an 18-month grace period. S&P 500: The S&P 500 closed nearly unchanged on Tuesday after President Donald Trump confirmed there would be no exemptions to the August 1 tariff rollout.

2025-07-09T01:10:24,"U.S. Stock Market Trends: Unveiling a Cautious Close","BitcoinWorld U.S. Stock Market Trends: Unveiling a Cautious Close In the fast-paced world of finance, every flicker on the traditional stock market screen sends ripples across the entire investment landscape, including the volatile cryptocurrency sector. Recently, the U.S. stock market delivered a mixed performance, leaving investors pondering the immediate implications and future trajectory. While the numbers might seem small at first glance, these subtle shifts in the U.S. Stock Market Trends often signal deeper currents that can influence everything from tech giants to Bitcoin’s price action. U.S. Stock Market Trends: What Do the Mixed Signals Mean? The recent close saw the three major U.S. stock indexes diverging, a scenario that often reflects underlying uncertainties rather than a clear market direction. This mixed bag performance highlights a market grappling with various forces, where different sectors react distinctly to prevailing economic narratives. Understanding these U.S. Stock Market Trends is crucial for any investor, traditional or crypto-focused. S&P 500: -0.07% – This broad market index, representing 500 of the largest U.S. companies, experienced a slight dip, indicating a cautious stance among a wide range of investors. Nasdaq Composite: +0.07% – Heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks, Nasdaq’s marginal gain suggests resilience in the tech sector, perhaps driven by specific company news or continued enthusiasm for innovation. Dow Jones Industrial Average: -0.37% – Comprising 30 large, publicly owned companies, the Dow’s more pronounced decline points to headwinds faced by traditional industrial and financial sectors. This could be due to concerns over interest rates, inflation, or broader economic slowdowns affecting established businesses. Dissecting the Stock Market Performance: What Drove the Divergence? Why did these major indexes behave so differently? The nuanced Stock Market Performance can be attributed to several factors, underscoring the complexity of current market dynamics where a single narrative rarely dictates the entire market’s direction. Instead, it’s a tapestry woven from multiple threads of economic data and corporate actions, directly influencing overall Stock Market Performance . Sectoral Rotation: Investors might be shifting capital between different sectors. For instance, defensive sectors (utilities, consumer staples) might see inflows during uncertain times, while cyclical sectors (industrials, financials) could face pressure. Company-Specific News: Earnings reports, product launches, or regulatory announcements from influential companies within each index can sway their overall direction. A strong earnings report from a tech giant on Nasdaq could offset declines elsewhere. Interest Rate Expectations: Speculation around the Federal Reserve’s next move on interest rates significantly impacts growth stocks (Nasdaq) more than value stocks (often found in Dow/S&P). Higher rates make future earnings less attractive, especially for companies relying on cheap capital. Inflation Concerns: Persistent inflation can erode corporate profits and consumer purchasing power, impacting the broader market. Different sectors have varying abilities to pass on increased costs to consumers. Global Economic Outlook: How Does it Influence Market Movements? Beyond immediate market reactions, the broader Global Economic Outlook plays a pivotal role in shaping investor confidence and asset prices. These macroeconomic headwinds and tailwinds create a complex environment that filters down to individual company performance and, consequently, the major stock indexes. A cautious Global Economic Outlook often translates into a more volatile and uncertain market. Inflationary Pressures: Central banks worldwide are battling inflation, leading to aggressive interest rate hikes. This impacts borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, potentially slowing economic growth. Geopolitical Tensions: Conflicts and political instability in various regions can disrupt supply chains, increase commodity prices, and create uncertainty, pushing investors towards safer assets or causing broad market sell-offs. Supply Chain Disruptions: Lingering issues from the pandemic and recent geopolitical events continue to affect the production and distribution of goods, leading to higher costs and reduced corporate profitability. Energy Prices: Fluctuations in oil and gas prices can significantly impact transportation costs, manufacturing, and consumer spending, directly influencing corporate earnings and economic stability. Decoding Market Sentiment: What’s Driving Investor Psychology? While economic data and corporate earnings provide the fundamental backbone, Market Sentiment acts as the invisible hand, often dictating short-term price movements. The mixed close we observed is a direct reflection of conflicting sentiments among investors. Understanding and anticipating shifts in Market Sentiment is as crucial as analyzing balance sheets, especially in today’s interconnected financial world where emotions can amplify market swings. Cautious Optimism: Some investors might see opportunities in specific sectors or believe that inflation is peaking, leading to small gains in certain areas. Fear of Recession: Others might be pulling back, fearing an impending economic downturn, which leads to declines in more vulnerable sectors. Uncertainty and Indecision: The slight movements indicate that a significant portion of the market is in a ‘wait-and-see’ mode, lacking conviction for a strong directional move. This indecision often leads to choppy, range-bound trading. The Role of News Cycles: Daily headlines, from inflation reports to central bank speeches, can dramatically shift sentiment, creating knee-jerk reactions that may not always align with long-term fundamentals. Cryptocurrency Market Impact: How Do Stock Ripples Affect Crypto? Given the increasing correlation between traditional markets and digital assets, the performance of the U.S. Stock Market Trends invariably sends ripples into the cryptocurrency space. While crypto markets often march to their own beat, they are not entirely immune to the macroeconomic forces influencing stocks. The mixed close in the stock market serves as a reminder that even for crypto enthusiasts, keeping an eye on traditional financial indicators is essential. The interconnectedness means that significant shifts in the Cryptocurrency Market Impact can often be traced back to broader economic and financial market trends. Bitcoin’s Role as a Bellwether: Bitcoin, often seen as ‘digital gold’ by some and a ‘risk-on’ asset by others, frequently mirrors the movements of risk assets like tech stocks. A cautious stock market can lead to consolidation or minor pullbacks in Bitcoin, influencing the broader crypto market. Altcoin Volatility: Altcoins, generally more volatile than Bitcoin, tend to amplify the movements seen in Bitcoin. If Bitcoin reacts negatively to stock market weakness, altcoins can experience more significant declines. Liquidity Flows: When traditional markets face uncertainty, institutional and retail investors might reallocate capital, potentially drawing liquidity away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies or, conversely, seeking them as a hedge if they view them as non-correlated (though this view is currently less prevalent). Regulatory Environment: While not directly tied to daily stock movements, the overall regulatory climate for both traditional finance and crypto is influenced by the prevailing economic outlook. A tightening financial environment can lead to increased scrutiny on nascent industries like crypto. Challenges and Opportunities for Investors This mixed market signal presents both challenges and opportunities. The challenge lies in navigating the uncertainty and avoiding impulsive decisions based on short-term fluctuations. However, it also creates opportunities for strategic positioning: For Stock Investors: It might be a time to re-evaluate portfolios, focusing on quality companies with strong fundamentals that can weather economic headwinds. Diversification across sectors and asset classes becomes even more critical. For Crypto Investors: This period could be an opportune time for dollar-cost averaging into preferred assets or exploring projects with strong utility and long-term vision, rather than chasing speculative gains. Understanding the broader economic context helps in making informed decisions about your potential Cryptocurrency Market Impact . Actionable Insights for Navigating a Mixed Market How can you make sense of these complex signals and position yourself effectively? Stay Informed: Continuously monitor both traditional financial news and crypto-specific developments. Knowledge is your strongest defense against volatility. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio, including a mix of traditional assets and cryptocurrencies, can help mitigate risks. Define Your Risk Tolerance: Understand how much risk you’re comfortable taking and adjust your investment strategy accordingly. This is particularly important when considering the potential Cryptocurrency Market Impact from traditional market movements. Long-Term Perspective: While daily fluctuations grab headlines, successful investing often hinges on a long-term view. Focus on the fundamentals and the potential for future growth rather than short-term noise. Consider Professional Advice: For complex financial decisions, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your goals. Summary: What Does a Mixed Close Truly Mean? The recent mixed close of the U.S. stock markets – with the S&P 500 and Dow dipping while Nasdaq held steady – is more than just a set of numbers. It’s a clear indicator of a market wrestling with conflicting forces, from inflation concerns to technological resilience. This nuanced Stock Market Performance reflects broader shifts in the Global Economic Outlook and directly influences Market Sentiment . For those in the digital asset space, understanding these U.S. Stock Market Trends is paramount, as the Cryptocurrency Market Impact is increasingly evident. In an era of interconnected finance, vigilance, diversification, and a long-term perspective remain the cornerstones of navigating these complex waters.

2025-07-09T00:50:31,"Trump Demands Urgent Interest Rate Cuts from Jerome Powell","BitcoinWorld Trump Demands Urgent Interest Rate Cuts from Jerome Powell The financial world is abuzz once again as former U.S. President Donald Trump has taken to his platform, Truth Social, to express a familiar and fervent demand: immediate interest rate cuts from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell . This latest call, highlighted by the Walter Bloomberg economic news account on X, reignites a long-standing debate about the independence of the central bank and the direction of U.S. economic policy . For those navigating the volatile waters of cryptocurrency, understanding these macroeconomic pressures is crucial, as Fed decisions often ripple across all asset classes, including digital currencies. Why is Trump Pushing for Rate Cuts from the Trump Fed ? Donald Trump’s consistent advocacy for lower interest rates stems from a belief that such a move would stimulate economic growth, boost the stock market, and make borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers. His latest comments on Truth Social underscore a recurring theme from his presidency: a desire for the Federal Reserve to adopt a more accommodative monetary stance. During his time in office, Trump frequently criticized Powell for not cutting rates aggressively enough, arguing that higher rates were hindering the U.S. economy’s full potential. The argument for rate cuts often centers on several key points: Stimulating Growth: Lower interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing for businesses, encouraging investment, expansion, and job creation. For consumers, it means cheaper mortgages and loan payments, potentially boosting spending. Combating Deflationary Pressures: In an environment where prices are falling or stagnating, rate cuts can help prevent deflation, which can be detrimental to an economy. Weakening the Dollar: Lower rates can make a country’s currency less attractive to foreign investors, potentially leading to a weaker dollar. This can make exports cheaper and more competitive, benefiting domestic industries. Market Boost: Historically, lower rates have often been associated with rising stock markets, as companies’ borrowing costs decrease and future earnings become more valuable. The Federal Reserve’s Independent Stance and Jerome Powell ‘s Dilemma At the heart of this discussion is the Federal Reserve’s role as an independent central bank. The Fed operates with a dual mandate from Congress: to achieve maximum employment and maintain price stability (low and stable inflation). This independence is designed to insulate monetary policy decisions from short-term political pressures, allowing the Fed to make choices based on economic data and long-term stability goals. Jerome Powell , as the current Chairman, has repeatedly emphasized the Fed’s commitment to its dual mandate and its data-dependent approach. His decisions are not made in isolation but are the result of deliberations by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which assesses a wide range of economic indicators, including: Inflation rates (Consumer Price Index, Personal Consumption Expenditures) Employment data (unemployment rate, job growth, wage growth) GDP growth Consumer spending and business investment Global economic conditions The challenge for Powell and the Fed is balancing the desire for economic growth with the need to control inflation. Cutting rates too soon or too aggressively could reignite inflationary pressures, eroding purchasing power and creating economic instability. Conversely, holding rates too high for too long could stifle economic activity and lead to a recession. The Ripple Effect: How Interest Rate Cuts Impact Markets, Including Crypto Monetary policy decisions by the Federal Reserve have profound effects across all financial markets. When the Fed signals or implements interest rate cuts , several dynamics come into play: Market Type Potential Impact of Rate Cuts Explanation Traditional Stocks (Equities) Generally Positive Lower borrowing costs for companies, higher corporate profits, and increased investor appetite for riskier assets over bonds. Bonds (Fixed Income) Yields Fall, Prices Rise Existing bonds with higher yields become more attractive. New bonds will be issued at lower yields. Real Estate Generally Positive Lower mortgage rates make homeownership more affordable, boosting demand and property values. Commodities (e.g., Gold) Mixed, Often Positive A weaker dollar (often a result of lower rates) makes dollar-denominated commodities cheaper for foreign buyers. Gold can also act as an inflation hedge if rate cuts lead to inflation. Cryptocurrencies Often Positive (Risk-On) Lower interest rates can reduce the attractiveness of traditional safe-haven assets and yield-bearing instruments, pushing investors towards higher-risk, higher-reward assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. Increased liquidity in the system can also flow into crypto. For the crypto market, a ‘risk-on’ environment, often fostered by lower rates and abundant liquidity, tends to be beneficial. When traditional investments offer lower returns, the allure of potentially higher gains in digital assets increases. Conversely, a ‘risk-off’ environment, driven by high rates or economic uncertainty, can lead investors to pull funds from speculative assets like crypto. The Broader Implications of Trump’s Stance on Economic Policy Trump’s repeated public demands on the Fed highlight a fundamental tension between political leadership and central bank independence. While politicians often prefer policies that can stimulate short-term growth and appease voters, central bankers are tasked with maintaining long-term economic stability, which sometimes requires unpopular decisions. The former President’s use of Truth Social as a direct communication channel amplifies his message, ensuring it reaches a wide audience and keeps the pressure on policymakers. This dynamic creates uncertainty for markets. Investors constantly weigh the potential for political influence on monetary policy against the Fed’s stated commitment to independence. Any perceived shift in the Fed’s stance due to external pressure could lead to market volatility, as participants adjust their expectations for future interest rate decisions. What to Watch For: Navigating Future Fed Decisions As the debate around interest rates continues, market participants, including crypto investors, should pay close attention to several key indicators and announcements: FOMC Meetings: The Federal Open Market Committee meets eight times a year to discuss and set monetary policy. The statements and press conferences following these meetings provide crucial insights into the Fed’s outlook. Inflation Data: Key inflation reports like the CPI (Consumer Price Index) and PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) are primary drivers of Fed decisions. Sustained declines in inflation could pave the way for cuts. Employment Reports: The monthly jobs report (Non-Farm Payrolls, unemployment rate) offers a snapshot of the labor market, a key component of the Fed’s dual mandate. Speeches by Fed Officials: Public comments from Jerome Powell and other Fed governors can offer hints about future policy direction. Understanding these signals can help investors anticipate potential shifts in the macroeconomic landscape and position their portfolios accordingly, whether in traditional assets or the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. Conclusion: The Enduring Battle Over Interest Rates Donald Trump’s latest call for interest rate cuts from Jerome Powell via Truth Social is more than just a political statement; it’s a stark reminder of the ongoing tension between political aspirations and the independent mandate of the Federal Reserve. While Trump advocates for policies he believes will accelerate economic growth, the Fed remains committed to balancing employment and price stability through its carefully considered economic policy . For investors, particularly those in the crypto space, these macroeconomic currents are vital. The Fed’s decisions on rates directly influence liquidity, risk appetite, and the broader financial environment, shaping the trajectory of digital assets. As this high-stakes economic dialogue continues, staying informed about the Fed’s actions and the rationale behind them will be paramount for navigating the markets successfully.

2025-07-09T00:00:50,"Altcoins Reclaim Trendline That Led To 2021 Explosion, Will History Repeat Itself?","The altcoin market is flashing a familiar signal that preceded its most explosive rallies in the past. After months of uncertainty and price consolidation, a new analysis suggests that altcoins have just reclaimed a critical trendline—the same one that marked the beginning of the 2017 and 2021 bull runs. With market patterns aligning and fractals emerging, analysts are now questioning whether the conditions are once again ripe for a massive altcoin breakout. Altcoins Eye Vertical Move As Bear Trap Ends The altcoin market may be on the brink of a historic breakout, according to a recent chart analysis by crypto expert Merlijn The Trader. The analyst draws parallels between the current cycle and those of 2017 and 2021. The analyst’s chart, published on X social media, shows that the total altcoin market capitalization has reclaimed a long-term ascending trendline that had preceded previous vertical expansions during major bull runs. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Not Remotely Close, Bitcoin Dominance Still Too High: Market Expert Says In earlier cycles, altcoins briefly broke this trendline in what was identified as a “bear trap” before swiftly reversing and launching into explosive growth phases. Merlijin The Trader reveals that this pattern appears to be repeating in this cycle, as the current market structure mirrors previous setups that triggered rapid valuation increases across the altcoin sector. The ascending trendline recovery is framed within a red box in the chart, consistent with the zones that marked the end of prior downtrends. In each instance, the reclaim was followed by aggressive upward movement, highlighted by green boxes that represented parabolic gains in the total market cap. Merlijn The Trader suggests that the recent rebound indicates the completion of another bear trap, signaling renewed bullish momentum. Green arrows placed below the price curve, matching the timing of previous breakouts within the analyst’s chart, imply that the altcoin market could be preparing for another phase of expansion. If the historical fractal holds, the analyst forecasts a sharp vertical rally for altcoins, with valuations possibly reaching the $10-$16 trillion range. Altcoin Market Mirror 2016-2018 Breakout Setup In another fresh analysis, Merlijn The Trader noted that the altcoin market cap is showing signs of repeating a historical pattern that previously led to a major bull rally. A comparison between the 2016-2018 market cycle and the current one reveals an almost identical structure playing out, albeit on a much larger scale. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Holds Altcoin Season At Bay, Analyst Says No Upside Until This Happens The market appears to have formed a Double Bottom, followed by a mid-cycle correction and consolidation within a descending broadening wedge pattern. This same fractal unfolded before the explosive altcoin rally in 2017. The analyst’s chart also illustrates that in the previous cycle, altcoins broke out of this same wedge pattern, resulting in a massive surge in market capitalization, which he referred to as “Pump 2.0”. With the same breakout now confirmed for this cycle’s market structure, Merlijn The Trader predicts that the altcoin sector may be entering its next parabolic expansion phase. This development could mark the end of the altcoin market’s current bear phase and the beginning of a second macro pump similar to what occurred between 2017 and early 2018.
