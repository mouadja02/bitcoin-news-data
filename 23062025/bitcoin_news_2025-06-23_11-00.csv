2025-06-23T08:39:41,"This is Why Bitcoin is Dumping?","The post This is Why Bitcoin is Dumping? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market just got hit hard, dropping to $3.12 trillion, while Bitcoin has plunged below the $100,000 mark , marking its lowest level since early May. This recent drop came in response to the escalating Iran-Israel war, with the U.S. stepping in between. This has led Iran to close the Strait of Hormuz for the first time since 1972, triggering a sharp dip in Bitcoin’s price. So, what’s the connection between the Strait of Hormuz and a crypto crash? Let’s break it down. Geopolitical Tension Hits Bitcoin $100k The most recent reason behind the bitcoin price crash was that Iran’s parliament has approved a move to block the Strait of Hormuz —a vital passage for about 20% to 30% of the world’s oil supply, which has rattled global markets. While the decision hasn’t been finalized yet, if closed, then the shipments of 20 plus million barrels of oil per day will be affected and will surge the oil price, possibly even hitting $100 per barrel. In fact, according to JP Morgan estimates, a closure of the Strait of Hormuz could send oil prices to $120-$130/barrel. This would imply a spike in US CPI inflation to ~5%. The last time we saw US inflation at 5% was in March 2023, when the Fed was aggressively hiking rates. pic.twitter.com/SwhsQZ1vzS — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) June 22, 2025 A spike in oil typically leads to inflation fears and pushes investors away from risky assets like Bitcoin. As a result, Bitcoin broke below the $100,000 mark after holding strong for 45 days. This break triggered concern across the crypto space, especially among traders with high-leverage positions. Chart Patterns Confirm the Fear According to crypto analyst CryptoKid , Bitcoin is showing clear signs of weakness. On the BTC chart, a “double top” pattern has formed, a bearish signal, along with a drop below key support levels. Because of this, analysts are now keeping an eye on the next important price zones. If Bitcoin continues falling, the next likely support levels are around $97,600 and $93,100 based on Fibonacci retracement levels. There’s also growing concern that Bitcoin could fall to $91,960, where a CME gap still exists. If that happens, it might lead to more panic selling and liquidations in the market. Altcoins in the Danger Zone Too With the bitcoin price hitting hard, altcoins are also seeing some heat. Meanwhile, altcoins like Solana, Dogecoin, and AVAX are also on thin ice as the price has seen in drop of 10%. However, the prices are approaching extreme lows—levels not seen since the last bear market. While some see it as a buying opportunity, Crypto Kid advises caution and reducing leverage during uncertain times.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/this-is-why-bitcoin-is-dumping/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|COMMODITY|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-23T08:38:26,"How Low Can Bitcoin Go? Arthur Hayes Says the Bottom May Be Close","The post How Low Can Bitcoin Go? Arthur Hayes Says the Bottom May Be Close appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The entire crypto markets were rocked after the U.S. military launched airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, causing over $1 billion in crypto liquidations . Bitcoin plunged to $99,000, breaking a 44-day streak above six figures. Meanwhile, the crypto has since been consolidating in a downward channel. Key levels to watch are $100K and $92K for support, with resistance near $107K and $112K. The fear of escalating war, possibly triggered by Donald Trump, sent both crypto and traditional markets into turmoil. War = Volatility… and Printing? Despite the chaos, Altcoin Daily analysts believe this dip is a buying opportunity. Historically, markets have rallied during wars due to increased government spending and money printing. While a full-scale war is unlikely, any de-escalation could trigger a major relief rally. Bitcoin dipping into the low $90K, or even $80K, would not break market structure, the analyst insists. Do you hear that? … it’s the sound of the money printers revving up to do their patriotic duty. This weakness shall pass and $BTC will leave no doubt as to its safe haven status. pic.twitter.com/PTfZaAXFp7 — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) June 22, 2025 Arthur Hayes, Co-Founder of BitMEX, suggests that central banks are preparing to print more money in response to current market weakness. He believes this will strengthen Bitcoin’s position as a safe haven asset, saying BTC will soon prove its true value. Short-term Haul? However, Glassnode reports that since April, Bitcoin corrections have repeatedly bounced off the Short-Term Holder Realized Price, the average cost basis for investors holding under 155 days. However, the STH-MVRV has now dropped to just 0.03, indicating that recent buyers are sitting on only 3% unrealized gains, reflecting growing pressure on newer investors. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : MetaPlanet Adds 1,111 More Bitcoins, Now Holds Over $1 Billion in BTC , Middle East & Global Bitcoin Adoption Surges The Middle East continues to embrace crypto. Sovereign wealth funds from Saudi Arabia to Bahrain are investing heavily in blockchain for national infrastructure. Meanwhile, Russia reportedly holds over $25 billion in crypto assets, quietly building its strategic reserves. The video highlights how Bitcoin is increasingly being treated like “physical gold,” especially during times of uncertainty. More billionaires, including Mexico’s third-richest man, are looking to buy Bitcoin, with some holding 80% of their portfolio in BTC and miners. U.S. states like Texas, Arizona, and New Hampshire are also launching strategic Bitcoin reserves, signaling long-term institutional confidence . Bitcoin’s Future Still Bright Analyst emphasizes that nothing has fundamentally changed about Bitcoin or crypto. The fear-driven dip should be seen as a temporary shakeout. With blockchain adoption rising globally, governments printing more money, and increasing institutional demand, the long-term thesis for Bitcoin remains bullish .

Here’s What You Need to Know!","The post Bitcoin Price Prediction: Is BTC Price Gearing Up for a 10% Pullback? Here’s What You Need to Know! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The market conditions appear to have varied a bit as the bearish dominance is slowly outweighing the bullish impact on the Bitcoin price . The token, which briefly plunged below $100K, now appears to be due for another 5% to 8% pullback, which certainly cannot be a major red flag. After a strong rally, some cooling off is normal, and several signals suggest it may be on the way. Momentum is decelerating, trading activity is shifting, and investors’ sentiment is slightly more cautious. In the times when the prices are still holding strong above key support levels, a dip around $92,000 to $95,000 could be considered a healthy correction. But the question arises whether this could give the market a chance to rest before the next move up, or will it lead to a deeper correction? Long-Term Holders & Institutions Remain Optimistic The external factors have been making a huge impact on crypto markets, especially on Bitcoin prices in recent times. With the war-like situation escalating, the risk assets have been facing the heat. Back in 2024, the BTC price experienced significant upward pressure for a week to 10 days, which resulted in a massive breakout ahead. Therefore, it is believed that the correction below $100K could be a massive bullish signal. This could be the reason that the long-term holders continue to accumulate more Bitcoin! On the other hand, the price drop has not stopped the institutions from accumulating Bitcoin. As per the latest update, Metaplanet bought 1,111 BTC while a Florida-based investment firm, Cardone Capital, added nearly 1,000 BTC and plans to add more than 3,000 BTC this year. Coming to the ETFs, Blackrock accumulated over 11,000 BTC throughout the past week, while ~3500 BTC were mined. This suggests institutions are optimistic about the BTC price rally, which suggests greener days ahead. Is Bitcoin Heading Back Below $100K? The Bitcoin price has reached one of the crucial support zones after plunging by more than 8% from the recent highs above $110K. The current market conditions and the trade patterns suggest the selling pressure has not yet faded. Hence, a deeper correction could be on the horizon, with the levels dropping as low as $92,000 in the coming days. As seen in the above chart, the BTC price is struggling to revive a strong upswing from the support zone; it has been stuck after the pullback. The Supertrend has changed to bearish, which could make the bullish divergence even more tedious, while the RSI is forming lower highs and lows, validating a bearish continuation. Overall trend of Bitcoin remains bearish technically, but a notable influx of buying pressure could nullify the bearish pressure. However, considering the current market conditions, it appears unlikely, as the BTC price could be about to drop below $100K. There is support at $98,817, which was tested recently, and another visit could probably break it. This could pave the way for the token to mark new monthly lows at the lower support zone around $93,500. Therefore, the upcoming monthly close could be pretty bearish, which may attract new opportunities to enter.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-price-prediction-is-btc-price-gearing-up-for-a-10-pullback-heres-what-you-need-to-know/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-06-23T08:29:44,"Pay with Crypto Like a Pro: How SpacePay Fits Right into Your Local Store","The post Pay with Crypto Like a Pro: How SpacePay Fits Right into Your Local Store appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ever tried paying with Bitcoin at the grocery store? The cashier looks at you like you just asked to trade seashells for milk, calls over a supervisor who’s just as confused, and you end up swiping your debit card like nothing happened. That’s been the reality of crypto payments for most people. SpacePay is actually fixing this mess. Their payment platform works with the card machines shops already have, connects to more than 325 crypto wallets, and instantly converts crypto to cash so merchants don’t have to worry about price swings. The London startup has pulled in over $1.1 million so far in their presale, with $SPY tokens going for $0.003181 right now. Finally, Crypto That Works in Real Stores Here’s the thing about most crypto payment solutions – they’re built by tech people for tech people. Store owners take one look at the setup requirements and run the other way. Who wants to buy expensive new equipment and train staff on some complicated system? SpacePay figured out the obvious solution everyone else missed. Instead of forcing businesses to replace their payment terminals, they made their system work with the Android machines already sitting on counters everywhere. Just a software update, and suddenly that same old card reader can handle Bitcoin payments. The customer experience is pretty smooth too. You just scan a QR code with whatever crypto wallet you’re already using, double-check the amount, and tap to pay. Takes about as long as using Apple Pay. No fumbling around with long wallet addresses or standing there awkwardly while some transaction processes for five minutes. Honestly, it seems so simple that you’d expect someone to have done this years ago. Businesses keep their equipment, customers use their existing wallets, and everyone’s happy. https://twitter.com/SpacePayLtd/status/1933247245706469417 Merchants Don’t Have to Become Crypto Traders Ask any shop owner why they won’t accept Bitcoin, and they’ll probably mention the price swings. Nobody wants to sell a $100 item for Bitcoin in the morning, then find out it’s only worth $85 by lunchtime because the market had another one of its episodes. SpacePay handles this perfectly. When someone pays with crypto, the merchant gets regular money in their account right away. That $100 sale stays $100, period. Doesn’t matter if Bitcoin decides to crash or moon five minutes later. The way it works is pretty clever. SpacePay locks in the exchange rate for those few seconds while the payment processes. If the market goes crazy during that tiny window, they eat the difference. The shop owner just sees a normal payment hitting their account. This removes the biggest excuse merchants have for avoiding crypto. They don’t need to understand blockchain technology or follow crypto news. They just get paid in dollars like always, except now they can serve customers who prefer digital money. Visit SpacePay Presale Saving Money on Those Annoying Processing Fees Credit card companies have been taking their cut for so long that most people just accept it as the cost of doing business. But those 2.5% to 3.5% fees really add up. A small restaurant doing $40,000 a month in sales is handing over more than $1,000 just in processing fees. SpacePay charges 0.5%. Same restaurant would pay $200 instead. That’s $800 extra every month that could go toward better ingredients, staff bonuses, or actually fixing that broken freezer. The savings work because SpacePay cuts out all the middlemen. With regular credit cards, your payment bounces around between banks and processors, with everyone taking their piece. SpacePay creates a more direct route using blockchain tech, so there are fewer hands in the cookie jar. Small businesses are getting hit with higher costs left and right these days, so every dollar they can keep matters. That extra cash might be what lets them hire another employee instead of working seven days a week, or finally replace equipment that’s been held together with duct tape. Every Crypto Wallet Actually Works Most crypto payment systems are picky about which wallets they support. You might have Bitcoin in one wallet and Ethereum in another, but the store only accepts payments from three specific apps you’ve never heard of. SpacePay works with over 325 different wallets. Whether you’re team MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or something more obscure, you can probably pay with what you’ve got. No downloading new apps or moving funds around just to buy a sandwich. This matters more than you might think. People get attached to their wallets, especially if they’ve got everything set up just right. Making them switch to pay at your store is asking for trouble. Better to meet customers where they are. The platform handles different cryptocurrencies without making a fuss about it. Bitcoin fans, Ethereum holders, and people into the newer coins can all shop at the same places. Pretty much everyone wins. Getting Started with SpacePay Anyone curious about the SpacePay ecosystem can check out their ongoing presale. Head to their official website and connect whatever crypto wallet you normally use. They accept ETH, BNB, MATIC, AVAX, BASE, USDT, and USDC for payments, or you can even use a regular bank card if you haven’t jumped into crypto yet. After picking how many tokens you want, just follow the steps to complete your purchase. Your $SPY tokens will sit safely in your wallet until the presale wraps up. At $0.003181 per token currently, people are getting in before the price likely increases in later presale stages.

2025-06-23T08:28:37,"Norwegian Mining Company Green Minerals Plans $1.2B Raise to Build Bitcoin Reserve","Norwegian deep-sea mining firm Green Minerals said Monday it plans to start buying Bitcoin as part of a broader push into blockchain, with a goal of raising up to $1.2b to expand its Bitcoin reserve. The move reflects growing corporate interest in using Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and monetary instability. In a statement , the Norwegian company said it has adopted a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy to diversify away from fiat currencies and strengthen its balance sheet. Green Minerals Touts Bitcoin as a Hedge Against Currency Debasement Executive Chairman Ståle Rodahl described the approach as a natural fit for a business with long-term capital needs and a forward-looking outlook. Bitcoin’s non-inflationary nature, he said, offered protection against currency debasement at a time of “significant monetary expansion.” Green Minerals plans to acquire its first bitcoins in the coming days and will work with industry specialists to develop a transparent and secure framework for managing the holdings. The company will also introduce a new metric, Bitcoin per share, or BTC/share, to give shareholders a clear view of the digital asset value tied to their equity. Firm Says Bitcoin Will Strengthen Capital Access Without Shifting Its Mission Green Minerals said that the strategy complements, rather than replaces, its core operations. The Bitcoin reserves are meant to help fund large-scale equipment needs and project development over time. The company also sees blockchain as a tool for improving transparency in mineral sourcing, supply chain integrity and regulatory compliance, key areas where Norwegian mining companies are under increasing scrutiny. This financing push will be part of a wider capital program, launched under its Partnership for Responsible Production, which sees digital assets as an integral part of its growth model. The firm believes Bitcoin can serve as both a treasury asset and a lever for accessing capital markets more efficiently. Green Minerals Taps Into Trend of Listed Firms Using Bitcoin for Growth Green Minerals joins a growing number of publicly traded firms adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset. According to Standard Chartered, more than 60 non-crypto companies have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets in recent years, following the path laid by MicroStrategy. That firm’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy, begun in 2020, helped send its stock price up more than 3,000%. For companies like Green Minerals, Bitcoin exposure offers something individual investors cannot easily replicate. Public firms can often raise capital through convertible debt markets, enabling them to acquire larger positions in Bitcoin at scale. This ability, coupled with their stocks often trading at a premium to underlying crypto assets, makes corporate adoption a powerful financial play.

2025-06-23T08:24:07,"Every Bank and Fintech Wants DeFi Under the Hood: Alchemy","Ever since President Donald Trump's administration signaled favorable crypto regulations, banks, financial institutions and big fintech firms have been looking to bring funds on-chain, and seamlessly offer compliant access to decentralized finance (DeFi), according to blockchain development firm Alchemy. DeFi, traditionally a way for anonymous users to engage in a complex system of automated lending and borrowing of assets, can bring to a whole new audience of users to conventional finance (TradFi), with the possibility of compliance guardrails in place and abstracting away the headache of dealing in smart contracts. The common pattern is best described as growing a “DeFi mullet,” according to Alchemy, a picks and shovels provider for blockchain builders that has been described as the “ AWS of crypto ,” a reference to Amazon Web Services, the ubiquitous cloud computing platform that powers much of today's internet. “I see firms like Fidelity, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Revolute and Robinhood, who are all at different stages of evolution, but who all want to allow their users to take their funds, like their USD or like fiat money funds, and then use DeFi tools,” Alchemy CTO Guillaume Poncin said in an interview. “The common pattern is best described by the term ‘DeFi mullet.’ These are the most interesting use cases, I think, where you can use DeFi under the hood, and the user doesn't even really need to know that that's happening,” Poncin said. A concrete example of this type of thing is the way users of U.S.-listed exchange Coinbase (COIN) can easily get loans in exchange for locking up their bitcoin BTC, a type of margin loan that retail investors don't normally get access to, Poncin pointed out. “Now it should be possible for Fidelity to offer these types of margin loans against your money-market fund account, as an example,” Poncin said. “All of this is plumbed into [crypto] wallets and DeFi, so that as a user, it's just one click. You want a loan against your Vanguard holdings? Here is a loan.” “I think a lot of fintechs are looking at that as a great proof of concept of what can be done. if you're tokenizing your money-market fund or tokenizing your other assets, private equity, whatever, eventually what you want is to give your users utility over that. And the utility vehicle is DeFi.” Alchemy appeared around five years ago, offering a developer platform for firms looking to build large scale blockchain operations. The firm went on to offer programmable links between programs known as APIs, allowing for data indexing, smart contract automation and smart wallets that feel invisible and intuitive. Poncin said. APIs, in effect, put the software plumbing behind the scenes and ease the burden on end users. “The old school way with blockchain wallets would involve installing Metamask, but that’s a very cumbersome process,” Poncin said. “The new trend is, if you are Nike or Stripe, you want to provide crypto wallets to your users they don't even know about; they're completely invisible under-the-hood wallets.”",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/06/23/every-bank-and-fintech-wants-defi-under-the-hood-alchemy,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT","Finance|Alchemy|Interviews|DeFi|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-23T08:21:54,"Bitcoin v. gold is ‘canary in the coal mine’ about to drop, warns strategist","Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone has warned that Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) weakening performance relative to gold could be signaling deeper trouble for U.S. equities and broader risk assets. In his bearish outlook, McGlone pointed to the falling Bitcoin-to-gold ratio as a potential “canary in the coal mine.” He emphasized that the 33x level on this ratio is a critical threshold for maintaining investor confidence in riskier markets, as per his X post on June 22. “Falling Bitcoin vs. gold could be a canary in the coal mine for risk assets, putting an inordinate burden on the cross to stay above 33x,” he said. The caution comes amid a backdrop of historic market turmoil. Specifically, the S&P 500 fell nearly 20% in the first half of the year, wiping out around $13 trillion in market capitalization, over 40% of U.S. GDP. Bitcoin and gold ratio chart. Source: Bloomberg Intelligence McGlone noted this marked the largest GDP-relative loss for a 20% correction in nearly a century, highlighting the severity of current market conditions. He backed his concerns with a comparison where the stocks have surged to record highs, but the Bitcoin/gold ratio has stumbled. Investors losing faith in Bitcoin? This divergence suggests that while equity valuations remain elevated, investors are losing faith in Bitcoin as a high-beta, risk-on asset, especially compared to gold’s safe-haven appeal. McGlone warned that unless Bitcoin begins to regain ground against gold, further declines in equities and speculative assets may follow. So far in 2025, gold has emerged as one of the year’s top-performing assets, with investors seeking refuge amid persistent uncertainty. Safe-haven demand has been fueled by rising trade tensions and escalating conflict in the Middle East, which intensified after U.S. airstrikes on Iranian targets . As a result, gold is on track for record inflows, with projections nearing $80 billion this year . Bitcoin, meanwhile, has mostly held above the $100,000 level but briefly dipped below that key support amid geopolitical jitters. Analysts warn that sustained losses below this threshold could trigger a deeper correction, potentially sending the asset toward $80,000 .

2025-06-23T08:18:07,"Adam Back, One of Satoshi Nakamoto Candidates, Speaks About Michael Saylor","Blockstream CEO Adam Back, who is alleged to be Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto, argued that the premium paid for MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock was not exaggerated. Speaking with Bitcoin Podcast host Stephan Livera at the BTC Prague conference, Back noted that the firm has rapidly doubled the amount of Bitcoin per share, reducing risk for investors. “In the case of MicroStrategy, we see that duration being 16 to 18 months. The stock has traded at twice its net asset value (NAV) at times. In that context, the premium seems reasonable,” Back said. According to Back, the premium in the stock prices of companies holding Bitcoin treasury is not theoretical, but a natural result shaped by market conditions. He pointed out that companies' issuance of new shares at this premium and the purchase of Bitcoin increases the amount of BTC per share. “These companies buy more Bitcoin thanks to the premium, thus increasing the amount of Bitcoin falling to shareholders,” he said. Describing MicroStrategy’s strategy as “an arbitrage between the fiat world and the future of Bitcoin,” Back stated that this method does not put investors at risk in the long run because the company compensates for this premium with Bitcoin. Related News: Watch Out: In the Middle of a Busy Week, There Are Lots of Economic Developments and Altcoin Events Coming Up - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List However, Back noted that smaller companies trading at a higher premium pose a greater risk of volatility. Giving the example of MetaPlanet, Back said the company’s NAV multiple fluctuates between 5 and 10, which can stress investors. However, he emphasized that such companies can be more agile in accumulating Bitcoin due to their smaller size. He added that being located in regulatory advantageous regions such as Japan can also facilitate this process. Back, who also opposed Bitcoin's “diminishing returns” theory in his speech, drew attention to the anomalies experienced in previous cycles. Arguing that factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, China's mining ban and money supply expansion overshadowed the 2020-2021 cycle, Back said that historical data could be misleading for this reason. Stating that there could be an “S-curve”-like acceleration in Bitcoin adoption, Back suggested that this cycle could trigger widespread adoption, unlike in the past, and break previous patterns. Back, who also spoke about Blockstream’s new initiatives in the last part of the conference, explained that with the company’s new application, users will be able to buy Bitcoin directly to their own wallets. He also stated that they are trying to make self-storage more accessible with Jade and Jade Plus hardware wallets. “Self-custody is critical to the decentralization of the Bitcoin network. People holding their own keys is crucial to the security and control of the network,” Back said. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-23T08:15:32,"Mysterious whale accumulates ETH after market dip","A newly created wallet turned into an ETH whale after buying the recent dip. The buyer appeared after nearly $80M in long liquidations for ETH. Whale activity remains significant for Ethereum (ETH), as whales are buying the dip. One newly created wallet withdrew 50,256 ETH from the Binance hot wallet, in tranches of 3,000 ETH. The whale started filling up the new wallet in the past 24 hours, after being first funded by a known Binance hot wallet. The whale started buying during one of the periods of rapidly sliding prices for ETH, when the asset wiped out more than 12% of its price. Its average entry was at $2,265 per ETH, starting from the beginning of the price slide. The whale activity suggests a rebound may be on the way, with predictions of a 25% price rally. The whale held only ETH valued at $112.8M, with a minimal amount of WETH. Buying ETH often precedes various forms of staking or usage as collateral to tap the current value and unlock liquidity. Large-scale ETH owners are cautious about taking profits, instead increasing their position and moving liquidity into DeFi. | Source: CryptoQuant Whales have also switched from panic-selling and liquidation to ongoing slow accumulation with the expectation of long-term ETH growth. Overall, whales have switched to accumulation since the end of 2024, with relatively small profit-taking in the past weeks. ETH shows signs of local lows The buying activity sets up expectations that ETH may be done with its downward correction, after nearly $80M in long liquidations in the past 24 hours. ETH open interest fell over the weekend following market volatility and liquidatoins, sliding to $14B from a recent level of $16B. Long positions are still over 75% of open interest, suggesting more liquidations could be instore. ETH traded at $2,239.78, sliding under its recent range. However, even ETH price crashes have led to additional buying from whales, with the goal of achieving a lower average price. ETH also rebounded from its lows against Bitcoin, once again returning to 0.022 BTC. Ethereum holders flock to big DeFi protocols Ethereum is becoming the playground of whales, with liquidity flowing to the top protocols. Based on DeFiLlama data, the Ethereum chain now locks around $57B in total value, with $125.67M in stablecoins. However, DeFi protocols are dominated by the three big sources of ETH passive income. LidoDAO holds over $20B, while Aave returned above $19B TVL. EigenLayer holds over $10B in ETH. The other DeFi protocols holding over $5B in value include Ethena, Ether.Fi and Spark. Lending remains near its peak, leading to whale accumulation and deposits into major protocols. ETH accumulation also follows the recent Pectra upgrade , as whales prepared for running the new larger nodes requiring 2,048 ETH. At the current price range, DeFi remains relatively safe from liquidations. Whales have rebuild lending positions with a high accumulation of liquidable loans at around $1,600, and another significant accumulation just above $1,000. For ETH, the current price action suggests more dips are possible, with most of the liquidable long positions at around $2,100. Liquidating short positions could bring ETH back above $2,300. For now, the overwhelming attitude for ETH is bearish, though still allowing for the occasional whale accumulation.

2025-06-23T08:10:10,"Texas Enacts Law to Integrate Bitcoin Reserves into State Financial Policy","Texas has officially established a legal framework for holding Bitcoin as part of its financial reserves, following the signing of Senate Bill 21 (SB 21) by Governor Greg Abbott on June 21, 2025. Legal Structure for Bitcoin Reserve Approved The new law empowers the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts to manage a dedicated Bitcoin reserve fund, which will be maintained outside the state treasury. Legislative appropriations, dedicated fees, investment income, and voluntary donations of cryptocurrency will support the fund. It introduces formal guidelines for the acquisition, custody, and liquidation of digital assets under state supervision. A key provision in SB 21 limits investments to digital assets with a minimum average market capitalization of $500 billion over the preceding 12 months, a criterion currently met only by Bitcoin. This restriction is designed to mitigate exposure to volatile or thinly traded tokens, effectively making Bitcoin the sole eligible asset for the reserve. Additional Measures to Protect State Crypto Holdings SB 21 follows the earlier passage of House Bill 4488, a complementary measure enacted to protect the state's Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency reserves from being absorbed into Texas’s general revenue fund. Without this legal safeguard, funds allocated for digital asset holdings faced the risk of being liquidated in 2025 to cover budgetary shortfalls. Together, the two pieces of legislation form a comprehensive framework: HB 4488 secures the legal status of Bitcoin reserves under state law, while SB 21 provides the operational authority to purchase and manage those assets. Policy Adjustments and Oversight Provisions During its progression through the legislature, SB 21 underwent several revisions. Notably, the House Committee on Delivery of Government Efficiency introduced clearer operational protocols, risk management guidelines, and limits on speculative investments using public funds. These amendments were aimed at addressing concerns over Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility and the fiscal prudence of allocating government resources to such assets. Broader Implications and Industry Response The decision to formalize Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset marks a notable development in state-level digital asset policy. Supporters argue that this move could enhance Texas’s financial resilience, act as a hedge against inflation, and position the state as a leader in digital asset integration within public finance. However, critics have flagged the initiative’s exposure to risks, including market volatility, regulatory shifts, and cybersecurity threats. Questions remain about whether allocating taxpayer resources to inherently speculative assets aligns with sound fiscal governance.

He’s currently waiting for gold and Bitcoin (BTC) to drop further before he can add more positions, but why the sudden shift to silver? The investor, who predicted the financial crash in 2008, believes that this is a prime time for accumulating silver. Part of his reasoning stems from the fact that gold and Bitcoin are near their all-time high levels, as of the moment of writing. He’s boldly stated that silver is currently a “ bargain” at these prices, and his predictions are that it could 2X, or even 3X this year. He has steadily been warning his followers of the next financial crash, which he thinks will be throughout the summer. FYI: Silver is the best investment today….june 2025.

The transaction was completed through a mobile phone, visually demonstrating the token’s utility in a real-world setting. According to her caption, the payment was successfully executed with XRP, underscoring ongoing efforts to promote real-world use cases for the digital asset within Japan’s growing XRP community. XRP Payment in Action at Community Gathering The video depicted a casual but purposeful demonstration of XRP being used to settle a transaction for food and drinks. This simple but important moment was showcased as part of a larger effort to normalize digital payments through the XRP Ledger. The setting—a relaxed after-party following XRPL Japan Community Day—allowed attendees and followers to witness the practicality of XRP in informal, day-to-day scenarios. The visual of the person using their mobile device to pay underscored the token’s potential as a reliable medium of exchange.

Some users drew comparisons to early Bitcoin milestones. One such reaction came from Michael Gigliotti, who suggested that the moment might be remembered similarly to Bitcoin’s first commercial transaction—paying for pizza in 2010. In a related tone, a commenter named LFC Fan entertained the idea that this could one day be seen as “XRP Taco Day,” alluding to a potential tradition within the XRP community that commemorates its early real-world uses. Not all replies shared this optimistic view. A more critical response came from a user identified as Shine195, who expressed frustration with XRP’s lack of price movement and perceived it as underwhelming in comparison to Bitcoin. They criticized the continued positioning of XRP alongside BTC, asserting that XRP lags significantly in value and market performance. Such comments reflect a long-standing split within the community between those who focus on utility and those who prioritize asset appreciation. Local Utility as a Driver for Broader Adoption Mai’s video and the broader XRPL Japan Community Day serve as part of a larger strategy to advance the perception of XRP as more than just a speculative asset. By making it visible in ordinary, real-world contexts—such as buying tacos and drinks—advocates aim to underscore its transaction efficiency and simplicity. These grassroots applications help the public engage with the token outside the abstract discussions on blockchain or trading platforms. As more community events adopt similar practices, such demonstrations may serve as blueprints for broader adoption in retail and social settings.

The minting happened in two steps as the company made $1 billion earlier and later added another $1 billion, which CEO Paolo Ardoino confirmed. Whale Alert posted on X , highlighting the latest $1 billion USDT mint at Tether’s Treasury address. Paolo Ardoino explained that the USDT is “authorized but not issued”. Tether holds it in reserve for future use, like customer redemptions or moving tokens between blockchains. Tether creates new USDT to meet future needs Tether’s recent decision to mint $2 billion worth of USDT on the Tron blockchain comes after another $1 billion USDT mint on Ethereum on June 18, just before the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest FOMC meeting . Tether has created a historic pattern in which it preemptively boosts stablecoin reserves ahead of possible liquidity surges. So many investors and analysts now assume the company expects the market conditions to change. Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain said the company is preparing in advance for expected demand because it is issuing large amounts of USDT without putting it directly into circulation. Stablecoins like USDT also lack the volatility of regular cryptocurrencies. They are common in market trends that Tether’s minting behavior follows, such as when investors increase their activity or when trading volumes spike on major exchanges. Popular crypto investor and commentator Lark Davis described the minting as a sign that “dry powder” is entering the system. This means the capital exists and will be deployed once favorable market conditions arise. His comments show hope of an upcoming shift to a more risk-on investment environment if the Fed leans toward cutting interest rates or signaling continued support for financial markets. Tether builds up reserves to keep USDT stable Tether continues to grow its reserves to support the stability and trust behind its popular stablecoin tied to the value of the U.S. dollar, USDT. Minting more tokens and holding them in reserve gives users confidence that they can always redeem their USDT for dollars if needed because it proves each USDT in circulation is fully supported by assets of equal value. The most recent $2 billion minting happened on the Tron blockchain because Tron offers fast and low-cost transfers for users who need to move large amounts of money quickly and affordably. Tether is giving users more flexibility in how they use the token and allowing exchanges and crypto to choose the network that best suits their needs in terms of speed and transaction fees by spreading USDT across multiple blockchains like Tron, Ethereum, and others. Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, said the newly minted USDT allows the company to respond faster to future demands from exchanges, institutional clients , or users who want to swap USDT between blockchains. This is because they are created in advance and held in Tether’s treasury as inventory. The company says it issues new tokens to ensure smooth service, not to influence or predict price movements, but some people in the crypto community think these large mints usually happen before Bitcoin and Ethereum prices rise and show incoming market rallies Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-06-23T07:30:44,"XRP Failed Because Ripple Created RLUSD, Claims BitGo CEO","BitGo chief executive Mike Belshe used his podium at American Banker’s Digital Banking 2025 conference to deliver a blunt verdict on Ripple’s decade-old settlement playbook: the plan to make XRP a universal bridge currency has failed, and Ripple’s newly issued US-dollar stablecoin RLUSD is the proof. Ripple Made RLUSD Because XRP Isn’t Needed Speaking in a session on banking access for digital-asset firms, Belshe opened with an appeal for direct Federal Reserve accounts before pivoting to Ripple’s history. “As a stablecoin business, you don’t need it, but do you want a master account? … We’d love a Fed master account, then we get to skip the banks.” From there he walked the audience back to 2014: “So if you go back in time in digital assets about ten years, there’s this company Ripple… They had originally decided they were going to try to tackle cross-border payments by use of their XRP token.” Belshe then dissected the two-step conversion model—dollars into XRP, then into pesos—arguing that the extra hop doomed the scheme. “It turns out that’s two conversions, right? And USD stablecoins are just better. So in fact, Ripple just launched a stablecoin, a US-dollar-backed stablecoin.” Stablecoins, he contended, will become the “rails across the world,” sweeping aside tokens whose only advantage is theoretical bridge liquidity. He painted an everyday retail scenario—phones tapped at farmers’ markets, interest airdropped monthly—and concluded: “It just works. It’s super simple. Peer-to-peer plus peer-to-intermediary.” While Belshe spoke, RLUSD is quietly growing. Ripple introduced the token last December after securing New York DFS approval ; by 2 April it had been integrated into Ripple Payments and had already reached a market capitalization of $244 million. Continued issuance on Ethereum pushed supply higher: on 21 June Ripple minted another 14 million RLUSD, lifting circulation toward $450 million. CoinMarketCap’s real-time dashboard now shows roughly $429 million outstanding, with daily volumes above $84 million. Ripple rejects the premise that adopting a dollar token concedes defeat for bridge token. In a series of posts and interviews earlier this year, Ripple CTO David Schwartz argued that RLUSD supplies price-stable working capital while the token remains the ledger’s default auto-bridging asset, handling path-finding and liquidity between non-dollar pairs. Community analysts amplified the point on X, contending that RLUSD “broadens the ecosystem” rather than replaces its native coin. Reactions to Belshe’s talk split sharply. Popular community member Crypto Eri (@sentosumosaba) who shared the video, commented via X: “This is why XRP needs: 1. SPOT ETFs 2. XRPFi 3. XRP Treasury Strategies 4. More Innovators & Builders. USD Stablecoins = LESS Conversations and therefore eating up the payments world.” One critic mocked the clip as “comedy gold,” saying it confirmed what skeptics have argued all along.” run the juels (@nullpackets) commented: “Thanks for giving your 275K followers a chuckle on a Sunday morning like this. We all need to laugh more. Oh man, this is xrp’er comedy gold.

2025-06-23T07:30:29,"Bitcoin Price Crash Far From Over As Support Sits Below $90,000 – Details","The Bitcoin price crash has been spurred on by looming war events as Iran and Israel continue to go head-to-head. Naturally, the financial markets have responded negatively to this news, and the crypto market has not been left out. Interestingly, the Bitcoin price had sat above the $100,000 psychological level for the longest. However, it was only a matter of time before it lost this support and crashed further, especially as the digital asset seems to only have major support in the 5-digit territory. Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Is Headed Below $90,000 In a TradingView post, crypto analyst Master Ananda has revealed major bearish formations for the Bitcoin price. With the $100,000 support having held so far through the last week, it suggested there is still some buying going on for the cryptocurrency. However, the chart does not show enough strength to hold this level. Related Reading: XRP On-Chain Activity Down 80% In 5 Months, Experts Argue Bullish/Bearish Implications Since the market has been rocked by over $1 billion in liquidations in the last week, it has transferred some weakness to the BTC price, putting the bears in charge once again. Pointing this out, Master Ananda explains that the weekly chart, in particular, is not showing any good signs. The current Bitcoin price action seems to only be a continuation of the bearish price action that began after it hit a peak of $111,900 back on May 19, 2025. Since then, the decline has been consistent, and the crypto analyst says the market looks “terrible” right now. Given the crash, the major support for Bitcoin is no longer above $100,000, but over 10% below it. As the price has previously broken below $100,000, the first support the market could see would be at $88,888. Failure to hold at this point would trigger another 5% decline toward $82,500 before bulls are able to put up any fight. What Happens If BTC Stays Above $100,000? While the bearish trend is the most dominant at this point, there is still the possibility that the Bitcoin price could stay back above $100,000 and hold the fort there. In this case, it is likely that the bullish trend would continue. The crypto analyst highlights this in another post, forecasting a very sharp upward move if this happens. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Divergence That Appeared Before The May ATH Has Returned Again In the case of a recovery, then Bitcoin could retest the upper trendline that sits right above $108,000. And as for how long all of this could take to play out, the crypto analyst believes that the entire thing shouldn’t take more than two weeks to actually unfold and pick a direction. “Do not be afraid if the market shakes, Bitcoin is going up; Crypto will grow, regardless of the short-term,” the analyst said in closing.

2025-06-23T07:24:17,"Projected Timeline for $10,000 In XRP to Become $1 Million","The possibility of turning a $10,000 XRP investment into $1 million remains one of the more ambitious yet widely discussed goals among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. As XRP continues to build momentum, several analysts and platforms have offered forecasts on how and when this milestone could realistically be achieved. This article reviews the valuation milestones required to reach the million-dollar mark and evaluates predictions from industry figures and research platforms regarding the timelines involved. Understanding What It Takes to Reach $1 Million from $10K in XRP At the current trading price of approximately $2, a $10,000 investment would acquire 5,000 XRP tokens. For this amount to grow into a $1 million portfolio, XRP would need to rise by nearly 9,900% to reach $200 per coin. Reaching this price level would mark a historically significant leap for XRP, surpassing its all-time high of $3.84 recorded during the 2017–2018 bull cycle. Though XRP has delivered major gains in previous cycles, replicating such growth in today’s market conditions poses substantial challenges. At $200 per unit, XRP’s total market capitalization would exceed $12 trillion. This would place its value above the combined market caps of several of the world’s largest technology firms, including Apple and Google. As a result, while the math behind the $10,000-to-$1 million scenario is straightforward, its feasibility continues to be debated among analysts and investors. Forecasts Suggest Varied Timelines to the $210 Mark Analysts have outlined different scenarios and timelines for when XRP could reach the required $200 price level. Among the more optimistic voices is Javon Marks, who believes XRP could reach $200 as a result of what he describes as a breakout from its “largest coil pattern of all time.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He draws a comparison to XRP’s multi-year consolidation from 2014 to 2017, which preceded a major rally. Marks believes the 2017–2024 period resembles that earlier setup, stating he still holds a triple-digit outlook for XRP in the current market cycle. In line with this bullish perspective, some in the XRP community have projected even higher valuations, with certain estimates ranging up to $305. These expectations are built on confidence in XRP’s long-term positioning and its potential role in the evolving financial system. On the other hand, several research platforms present more conservative projections. According to Telegaon , XRP might not reach $236 until 2050. This places the $1 million outcome over two decades into the future. Similarly, Changelly’s forecast suggests a timeline between 2034 and 2040 for XRP to reach $200. These estimates reflect a cautious approach and assume a more gradual pace of adoption and market growth. Contrasting Views from the XRP Community and Analysts Within the XRP community, such long-term projections are often dismissed as overly cautious. Critics of the 2050 and 2040 timelines argue that these projections stem from analysts who are unwilling to consider XRP’s future potential. Some community members attribute these estimates to “Bitcoin maxis” who prioritize Bitcoin’s dominance over competing digital assets. A notable alternative view comes from BarriC, a respected voice within the XRP ecosystem. He has predicted that XRP could reach $200 between 2032 and 2033. This estimate, while still conservative compared to Marks’ outlook, is viewed by many as more reasonable and achievable. Additionally, Matthew Brienen, Chief Operating Officer of CryptoGuard, has stated that XRP could reach $1,000 by 2035 , implying an earlier arrival at the $200 threshold. While the goal of turning a $10,000 investment in XRP into $1 million requires the token to reach $200, opinions differ widely on when such a price level might be reached. From as early as this cycle to as late as 2050, expert predictions span decades. Despite this range, interest in XRP’s long-term trajectory remains strong.

The firm currently has a total of 11,111 BTC holdings, valued at over $1.07 billion. Metalplanet bought the digital asset at an average purchase price of 15,535,502 yen ($106,408 million) per Bitcoin.

(@Metaplanet_JP) June 23, 2025 Metaplanet’s latest acquisition marks a major milestone in its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy, which commenced in mid-2024 and accelerated through early 2025. Since December 2024, the company has grown its stash nearly 28-fold since it formalized its Bitcoin Treasury Operations as a core business initiative, pivoting from its hotel management business. The investment company also reported a quarter-to-date BTC yield of 107.9%, up from 95.6% in Q1 and 309.8% in Q4 2024. The firm uses the metric as a key performance indicator to track Bitcoin per fully diluted share over time, excluding the effects of dilution. Metaplanet also posted a BTC gain of 4,367 BTC for $451.2 million for the ongoing quarter, based on reference prices from Bitflyer. The Tokyo-based firm has funded its Bitcoin purchases through a series of capital market activities, including multiple zero-coupon bond issuances and equity-based investments. Since January, Metaplanet has issued and redeemed more than a dozen series of ordinary bonds and stock acquisition rights, largely subscribed by EVO FUND. The company has issued over 210 million shares under its ‘210 Million Plan.’ The investment firm’s board of directors resolved on June 16 to issue $210 million via no-interest bonds and raised that figure to buy more BTC. Metaplanet revealed that it aims to purchase 210,000 Bitcoins by the end of 2027. According to Bitbo data, if successful, the acquisition would make the company the second-largest holder of Bitcoin among public companies, behind Michael Saylor’s company, Strategy. Previously, under the firm’s 21 million plan, it would hold 21,000 BTC by the end of 2026, with no concrete plan for more buys. Between May and June 2025 alone, the company raised over $300M through bonds and exercised stock rights, with proceeds explicitly allocated for Bitcoin accumulation. A June 3 report from Standard Chartered found that, the Bitcoin reserve strategy trend has led to 61 publicly listed firms out of a total of 124 now holding a combined 3.2% of all BTC that will ever exist. Bitcoin remains resilient amid ongoing global geopolitical tensions Metaplanet added to its Bitcoin reserves amid an escalation in the Middle East war and the looming uncertainty over global financial markets. Investors are watching to see how the financial system will react when markets open on Monday, following the involvement of the U.S. in the conflict over the weekend. U.S. President Donald Trump announced Saturday evening that the United States had launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities. He revealed that the U.S. military carried out massive precision strikes on the three key nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. The price of Bitcoin has slid by roughly 1% in the last 24 hours and had dipped below the $100K mark on Sunday, before recovering and hovering at $101,800 at the time of publication. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a metric tracking overall market sentiment, is currently at 47, moving towards a bearish bias among investors and a possible bearish signal for digital assets in the wake of mounting geopolitical tensions.

But behind its classrooms and job-ready courses lies a big financial strategy few expected — a growing Bitcoin treasury inspired by none other than Michael Saylor, the Strategy CEO known for turning Bitcoin into a corporate asset. From Napster to Bitcoin: Jetking’s Early Bet on Decentralization In an exclusive interview with Coinpedia, Jetking’s CFO Siddarth Bharwani revealed the company’s long-standing interest in peer-to-peer systems since the Napster era. So, when Bitcoin emerged, its decentralized structure instantly clicked with Jetking’s tech-savvy leadership. By 2017, the company began exploring Bitcoin. But it was Saylor’s high-profile move to institutionalize Bitcoin at MicroStrategy that truly changed the game for Jetking, transforming their view of Bitcoin from a tech curiosity to a potential treasury asset. “It was Michael Saylor’s move to institutionalize Bitcoin on MicroStrategy’s balance sheet that catalysed our own shift in perspective — highlighting Bitcoin not just as a technology, but as a transformative treasury asset. This conviction led us to formally begin accumulating Bitcoin in March 2022.,” the CFO shared. COVID-19: The Crisis That Forced a Financial Rethink Jetking’s pivot to Bitcoin wasn’t just driven by curiosity, it was born out of survival. The pandemic devastated Jetking’s operations, wiping out 40 years of physical expansion in just 12 months. In March 2022, Jetking took its first steps, formally buying Bitcoin as a treasury asset. “We looked at Bitcoin and Bitcoin being the hardest money available on earth, we went ahead and bought Bitcoin on our Balance sheet,” he said. 18,000 Bitcoin by 2030: The Big Bet Jetking isn’t stopping at a few Bitcoins. The company has an ambitious roadmap to accumulate 210 BTC by 2025, and eventually reach 18,000 BTC by 2030. “Capital efficiency is maximized through Fundraises, cash flow recycling and market-hedged exposure — all while aligning dilution control with long-term Bitcoin appreciation and shareholder value creation.” The company is focusing on capital efficiency, market-hedged exposure, and disciplined fundraises, all while keeping shareholder dilution under control. They want to build Bitcoin exposure the smart way, not the reckless way. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This buying came amid the ongoing Iran-Israel war, which has caused the entire crypto market to drop 5% to 10%. Metaplanet Bought 1,100 Bitcoin According to the Metaplanet report , the latest Bitcoin was purchased at an average price of 15,535,502 yen per BTC, which is roughly $105,946 per Bitcoin. Despite the high price tag, MetaPlanet seems calm. What makes this move even more remarkable is the 306.7% year-to-date (YTD) return MetaPlanet has achieved in 2025 alone. This performance reflects not just Bitcoin’s strong rally this year, but also the firm’s strategic timing and belief in Bitcoin as a store of value. Metaplanet 1% Bitcoin Plan As of June 23, the Metaplanet holds a massive 11,111 BTC, acquired for around $1.07 billion, at an average cost basis of $95,869 per Bitcoin. Meanwhile, just last week, Metaplanet bought 1,112 more Bitcoins for about $117.2 million. But the company isn’t stopping there. Metaplanet has already announced plans to raise $5.4 billion, aiming to own 1% of all Bitcoin in existence, about 210,000 BTC, by the end of 2027. It’s one of the boldest Bitcoin strategies ever seen from a public company. Metaplanet Stock Price plummets by 8% The market has been watching Metaplanet’s Bitcoin moves closely. After the announcement, Metaplanet’s stock price showed some volatility. On June 23, 2025, Metaplanet shares closed at 1635 JYP, down 8.77% for the day, following a period of strong gains earlier in the month. The recent dip reflects broader market jitters, not just from the Bitcoin purchase but also due to the escalating conflict in the Middle East, which has rattled global stocks.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/metaplanet-adds-1111-more-bitcoins-now-holds-over-1-billion-in-btc/,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

After U.S. airstrikes targeted three major Iranian nuclear sites, President Donald Trump declared the attacks a “success,” warning of intensified retaliation if provoked. These strikes come after a week of conflict between Israel and Iran, rattling global markets. Against this geopolitical backdrop, the market capitalisation of the industry dropped 1.50% to $3.1 trillion. Trading volume spiked 26.23% to $136.38 billion as volatility followed with full force. Bitcoin is down 1.27% at $101,497.55, Ethereum lost 1.99% to trade at $2,241.94, and XRP slipped 2.52% to $2.02. Talking about sentiments, the Fear & Greed Index dropped to 37, highlighting growing investor anxiety. Crypto Liquidations Today Surge to $647M In the past 24 hours, total crypto liquidations rose to $647.41 million, affecting over 185,000 traders. Of these, long positions accounted for a whopping $504.95 million, indicating that bullish traders were caught off guard by the swift price reversal. It is worth nothing that the largest liquidation was a $35.45 million BTC-USDT long on HTX. Source: CoinGlass Bybit led the exchanges with $252.46 million in liquidations, followed by Binance at $137.57M and Gate with $96.57M. The majority of liquidated positions were long, with ratios as high as 95.14% on Bitmex and over 90% on Bitfinex and CoinEx. Which signal a strong bias toward expecting upward price movement that ultimately collapsed. Crypto Market Cap Analysis The total crypto market cap currently sits at $3.09 trillion, recovering slightly from an intraday low of $3.04T. Technically, the price touched the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting potential oversold conditions. The RSI at 38.41 also hints at bearish exhaustion, with room for a short-term relief bounce. However, the market remains below the 20-day SMA of $3.23T, confirming ongoing downward pressure. With BTC dominance at a cycle-high of 64.9%, altcoins are underperforming. ETH dominance has slipped to 8.7%, reflecting broader weakness across major Layer 1s. While the market has witnessed the wrath of external influences, the business still has top gainers in this chaotic session. Which include Story IP with +11.35% intraday gains, Four with +10.39% price surge, and Sonic with +7.68% gains, showing that select microcaps are still attracting speculative interest. Also read our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! FAQs 1. Why are crypto liquidations so high right now? The $647M liquidation spike comes from a sharp market downturn triggered by geopolitical tensions and overly optimistic long positions getting wiped out. 2. What does a Fear & Greed Index of 37 mean? An index reading of 37 signals “Fear,” indicating investors are cautious. 3. Is the crypto market likely to recover soon? Technically, the RSI and Bollinger Band levels suggest a potential short-term rebound. However, recovery will heavily depend on geopolitical developments.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-liquidations-today-wipe-out-185000-traders-and-647-million/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-06-23T07:04:14,"Hacking Group Targets Insurance Giant Aflac – Personal and Medical Data May Be at Risk: Report","A sophisticated hacking group has reportedly compromised American insurance company Aflac, putting customers’ personal information at risk. The company is investigating a breach on its US network with characteristics consistent with the hacking collective known as the Scattered Spider, Reuters reports . The group, sometimes referred to as “UNC3944,” is believed to be mostly made up of young adults and based in the US and the UK. It’s known to have made several other high-profile breaches targeting Visa, Marks & Spencer, PNC Financial Services Group Inc. and several others. An Aflac spokesperson says the firm is still in the early stages of reviewing the attack and that it is not yet ready to divulge information relating to the number of affected customers or how long the investigation will go on. Aflac, which offers accident and pet insurance plans in the US and Japan to its 50 million users, has now potentially exposed its customers’ personal information, including their Social Security numbers and health-related information. Steve Cagle, CEO at healthcare security firm Clearwater, says that Scattered Spider’s specialty seems to be social engineering techniques, such as tricking help desks into resetting credentials and bypassing multi-factor authentication. The group is also known to be expert SIM swappers, which is when a hacker takes control of a target’s mobile phone plan in order to receive their 2FA (two-factor authentication) codes and log in to their accounts. Noah Michael Urban, a member of the group, was recently ordered to pay back $13.2 million to 59 victims after being charged with masterminding a SIM swapping scheme, according to The Register . Urban is currently facing 20 years in federal prison on each wire fraud charge.

2025-06-23T06:21:24,"Robert Kiyosaki Predicts Biggest Market Crash in History Is Coming","The post Robert Kiyosaki Predicts Biggest Market Crash in History Is Coming appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market slipped over the weekend as rising Middle East tensions and inflation fears triggered a selloff. Bitcoin dropped below $99,000 for the first time since May, with Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin also falling sharply. Though prices slightly recovered by late Sunday, major coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum remained down, reflecting investor caution amid growing global uncertainty. The rising geopolitical tensions after Trump’s strike on Iran and the continuous debt pressure weigh on markets. Amid this unease, renowned author and investor Robert Kiyosaki has renewed his warning about what he calls the “biggest global debt bubble burst in history.” As digital assets and traditional markets fluctuate, Kiyosaki’s predictions are again sparking conversations across the financial world. GLOBAL MONETARY COLLAPSE COMING? Will you be richer or poorer when biggest debt bubble in history bursts. I recommend owning gold, silver, and BITCOIN if you want to be richer when the Global Debt Bubble bursts. BIGGEST LOSERS will be savers of fake fiat money and especially… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 23, 2025 Kiyosaki’s Call for Tangible Assets In a recent X post, Kiyosaki urged investors to move away from fiat currency savings and instead build positions in tangible assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin. His long-held belief is that these alternatives offer better protection against looming economic instability. He reiterated that the global economy is dangerously inflated with debt and that a collapse is not only possible but likely. Past Predictions Back in Focus I shouldn’t brag but in 2013 I published “Rich Dads Prophecy” predicting the world economy today. It still pisses-me -off that so many modern day “prophets” whose names I will not mention, due to “professional courtesy” are now claiming to have warned of this extreme crisis we… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 19, 2025 Kiyosaki’s views aren’t new. He previously discussed similar warnings in his book Rich Dad’s Prophecy, which he claims accurately forecasted today’s economic scenario. Lately, he’s expressed frustration over what he sees as newer voices gaining recognition for insights he believes he shared years ago. His prediction of a potential silver surge, possibly doubling in value by year-end, has also resurfaced in recent discussions, further strengthening his focus on commodities. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Exclusive Bitcoin Price Prediction: Jetking CFO Expects BTC to Hit $150K by Year-End , Looking at the current scenario, he bets high on silver and believes it is the best investment right now, as of June 2025. He believes gold and Bitcoin are currently too expensive and is waiting for a price drop before buying more. Impact on Investor Sentiment Kiyosaki’s warning hits hard for many investors who are already nervous about the shaky state of the global economy. While some think he’s being overly dramatic, others agree with his advice to move money into things like gold, silver, and Bitcoin instead of relying too much on regular cash savings. With growing doubts about the strength of traditional currencies, his message is gaining attention. As markets face more uncertainty, voices like Kiyosaki’s, whether you agree with them or not, are pushing more people to think about where their money is safest during tough times. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

How do geopolitical tensions and inflation affect the crypto market? Geopolitical tensions and inflation fears increase investor caution, leading to selloffs in risky assets like cryptocurrencies as investors seek safer havens.

While direct contagion is debated, significant crypto crashes can reflect broader risk-off sentiment, impacting investor confidence and potentially leading to sell-offs in correlated traditional assets.

BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) This bounce aligns with the lower boundary of a multi-month ascending channel, reinforcing the technical importance of the $99,250–$100,000 region as a strong macro support. However, the price is now approaching dense EMA resistance zones near $102,800–$104,500, raising questions about the sustainability of this rebound. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price?

Crypto Market Outlook Digital assets continued to weaken over the weekend following US military action in the Middle East and more rhetoric from Iran and Russia as the situation escalates. Markets lost 4% in a fall to $3.15 trillion but managed to recover slightly during early trading in Asia on Monday morning. Losses were led by Bitcoin, which fell to $98,500 briefly in its first sub-six-figure dip since May 8. However, BTC had reclaimed the $101,000 level at the time of writing. Ethereum dumped more than 7% in a fall to $2,135, its lowest level since it broke above $2,000 in early May. Nevertheless, it also made a minor recovery to trade around $2,240 on Monday morning.
