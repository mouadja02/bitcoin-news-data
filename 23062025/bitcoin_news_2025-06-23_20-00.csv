2025-06-23T17:45:00,"Solana ETFs: Summer Of SOL","Summary The SEC has initiated its typical review process with issuers over their spot Solana ETFs filings, which means that approval of spot Solana ETFs is imminent. Volatility Shares launched two crypto-linked Solana ETFs (i.e., not spot Solana products) - the Solana ETF and the 2x Solana ETF - on March 20, 2025. Currently, eight issuers have filed S-1s for spot Solana ETFs: VanEck, 21Shares, Canary Capital, Bitwise, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and CoinShares. The SEC has initiated its typical review process with issuers over their spot Solana ETFs filings, which means that approval of spot Solana ETFs is imminent - possibly within the next few weeks. General consensus among analysts and the broad public is optimistic on approval. Polymarket puts the possibility of Solana ETF approval at 91% in 2025 and at 68% by July 31. If approved, a spot Solana ETF would provide regulated access to Solana through brokerage platforms without the complexities of crypto wallets or crypto exchanges. It could also pave the way for broader institutional adoption and inclusion in diversified basket ETFs alongside bitcoin and ether. Here’s what advisors and investors need to know about the potential products and issuers involved. Solana Potentially the Next Spot Altcoin ETF Solana ( SOL-USD ) is a blockchain platform that is generally faster and cheaper than Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). According to CoinMarketCap, Solana is currently the sixth-largest cryptocurrency, with around 2.4% market share in the overall cryptocurrency sector. Futures-Based Solana ETFs Have Relatively High Inflows Volatility Shares launched two crypto -linked Solana ETFs (i.e., not spot Solana products) - the Solana ETF ( SOLZ ) and the 2x Solana ETF ( SOLT ) - on March 20, 2025. SOLZ currently has almost $20 million in assets, while the leveraged SOLT has almost $45 million. While $20 million in the non-leveraged SOLZ product doesn’t seem like a lot, those assets are already in the same ballpark as the third and fourth-largest spot ether products: the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ( ETH ) and the Fidelity Ethereum Fund ( FETH ) which have just over $20 million each. And YTD, SOLZ actually has some of the highest net inflows relative to other altcoin products. 8 Issuers Have Filed S-1s for Spot Solana ETFs Currently, eight issuers have filed S-1s for spot Solana ETFs: VanEck, 21Shares, Canary Capital, Bitwise, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and CoinShares. VanEck Solana ETF (VSOL) – link to S-1 21Shares Core Solana ETF (no ticker) – link to S-1 Canary Marinade Solana ETF (no ticker) – link to S-1 Bitwise Solana ETF (no ticker) – link to S-1 Grayscale Solana Trust ( GSOL ) – link to S-1 Franklin Solana Trust (SOEZ) – link to S-1 Fidelity Solana Fund (no ticker) – link to S-1 CoinShares Solana ETF (no ticker) – link to S-1 Out of the usual players, all issuers who currently have spot bitcoin and spot ether ETFs have filed for an S-1 except for BlackRock (iShares) and Invesco Galaxy. Invesco Galaxy has taken some early steps toward a Solana ETF, but has not yet officially filed an S-1. Simultaneous Product Launches Can Benefit Larger Issuers The SEC has traditionally launched similar crypto products simultaneously rather than on a rolling basis. In other words, all spot bitcoin ETFs were launched on the same day and all spot ether ETFs were launched on the same day despite different filing dates. Following this precedent, Solana products will likely be launched on the same day. The reason for the above has to do with several factors. First of all, it was assumed to “level the playing field” and provide opportunities to all issuers to start off on the same foot. It also simplifies the SEC’s internal review process, especially for novel asset classes like cryptocurrencies, where legal, technical , and compliance issues require ongoing dialogue across multiple filers. But this process has historically benefited larger, well-known issuers. During both bitcoin and ether launches, BlackRock and Fidelity products gained significantly more assets than smaller competitors. When faced with the choice of almost identical products with identical fees, advisors and investors are likely to choose by name recognition, which gives larger asset managers an edge over smaller or lesser-known issuers. Several Early Issuers Urge SEC to Reconsider “First to File” Model On June 5, several issuers including VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital submitted a joint letter to the SEC asking them to return to the “first to file” approval model. They argue that simultaneous launches take away incentive for early filers and, by default, take away motivation to innovate and develop new products. VanEck has traditionally been an early filer. They were the first ETF issuer to file for a bitcoin futures ETF and a spot Solana ETF. They were also one of the first issuers to launch a crypto equity ETF. In the case of Solana, Fidelity filed much later than most of the other issuers, but has the potential to gain the most assets due to its brand recognition and scale. While BlackRock has not yet filed for a Solana ETF, it is possible they could also throw their hat into the ring, which could further skew potential assets for the current issuers. Staking Will Potentially Be Included in Solana ETFs… & More Filings for Solana ETFs have included provisions for staking. Staking is an important part of Solana’s investment appeal. According to Coinbase, the yield on Solana is over 5%, while the APY of ether is closer to 2%. When spot ether ETFs were launched last year, they had to remove language about staking. Now they have filed again after the fact. The SEC seems more supportive of staking, according to a statement released on May 29. This shift in regulatory stance suggests that the SEC may approve staking provisions in both Ethereum and Solana ETFs simultaneously, potentially as early as this summer, which would align these ETFs more closely with their underlying crypto assets. Issuers Actively Filing for Several Other Altcoin ETFs Out of the eight issuers filing for Solana ETFs, Grayscale has the most active filings with the SEC (mostly conversions), followed by Canary Capital. Grayscale: Grayscale Litecoin Trust , Grayscale XRP Trust , Grayscale Dogecoin Trust , Grayscale Avalanche Trust , Grayscale Cardano Trust , Grayscale Polkadot Trust , Grayscale Hedera Trust , conversion for the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (GLDC) Canary Capital: Canary XRP ETF , Canary HBAR ETF , Canary Litecoin ETF , Canary SUI ETF , Canary Staked TRX ETF , Canary Staked CRO ETF 21Shares: 21Shares Core XRP Trust , Polkadot , 21Shares Dogecoin ETF , 21Shares SUI ETF Bitwise: Bitwise XRP ETF , Bitwise Dogecoin ETF , conversion for the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ( BITW ) CoinShares: CoinShares XRP ETF , CoinShares Litecoin ETF VanEck: VanEck Avalanche ETF , VanEck BNB ETF Franklin: Franklin XRP ETF Fidelity: N/A Potential Spot Solana ETF Issuers Have Wide Range of Existing Crypto Assets For reference, here is the current standing of products for the eight issuers discussed. All of these issuers except for Canary Capital already have crypto ETFs (Canary has institutional funds available). Disclosure: © VettaFi LLC 2025. All rights reserved.

2025-06-23T17:41:37,"Strategic MicroStrategy Bitcoin Accumulation Continues: Holdings Top 592,000 BTC","BitcoinWorld Strategic MicroStrategy Bitcoin Accumulation Continues: Holdings Top 592,000 BTC Get ready for another exciting update from the world of corporate Bitcoin strategy! MicroStrategy, the business intelligence firm turned Bitcoin whale, just announced its latest move, further solidifying its position as the largest corporate holder of the digital asset. If you’re following the world of Bitcoin investment, especially institutional moves, this news is significant. Understanding MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Strategy For years, MicroStrategy has been a pioneer among publicly traded companies adopting Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset. Led by its executive chairman, Michael Saylor, the company embarked on this journey with a clear vision: to acquire and hold Bitcoin for the long term, viewing it as a superior store of value compared to traditional fiat currencies. This MicroStrategy Bitcoin strategy isn’t just about buying dips; it’s a fundamental shift in how a corporation manages its capital. Instead of holding cash that might depreciate due to inflation, MicroStrategy leverages various financing methods, including debt and equity offerings, to acquire more Bitcoin. The Latest Bitcoin Holdings Update On June 22, Michael Saylor took to X (formerly Twitter) to share the latest figures on MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings . The company added another 245 BTC to its stash. Here are the key takeaways from the announcement: Latest Purchase: 245 BTC Cost of Latest Purchase: Approximately $26 million Total Holdings: A staggering 592,345 BTC Average Acquisition Price: $70,681 per BTC Year-to-Date Return: 19.2% on their Bitcoin holdings This recent acquisition, though smaller than some previous buys, demonstrates MicroStrategy’s consistent approach to BTC accumulation, regardless of market volatility. They continue to buy whenever strategic opportunities arise. Michael Saylor’s Vision and BTC Accumulation At the heart of MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy is Michael Saylor himself. A staunch advocate for Bitcoin, Saylor views it as digital gold and a hedge against inflation. His conviction has not only shaped MicroStrategy’s treasury policy but has also inspired many other corporations and investors to consider Bitcoin. Saylor’s public commentary often focuses on the long-term potential of Bitcoin and its role in a global digital economy. His consistent messaging and the company’s actions provide a case study in corporate adoption of a non-sovereign, decentralized asset. This makes him a central figure when discussing corporate Michael Saylor and his influence on Bitcoin’s trajectory. Impact of Corporate Bitcoin Strategy MicroStrategy’s bold Corporate Bitcoin Strategy has several significant impacts: Market Confidence: Large, public purchases signal confidence in Bitcoin to other institutional and retail investors. Validation: It validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class for corporate treasuries. Price Influence: While not the sole driver, MicroStrategy’s consistent buying adds significant demand to the market. Setting a Precedent: They have paved the way and provided a blueprint for other companies considering similar moves. The fact that MicroStrategy continues to acquire Bitcoin, even at higher price levels, suggests a strong belief in its future appreciation and long-term value proposition. What Does This Mean for Investors? MicroStrategy’s actions offer insights for investors: Long-Term Perspective: The strategy emphasizes holding Bitcoin for the long haul, weathering market cycles. Conviction: It highlights the importance of conviction in your investment thesis. Macro View: The strategy is driven by a macro view of currency debasement and the need for sound money. While retail investors may not have the same capital structure as a corporation, the underlying philosophy of treating Bitcoin as a long-term store of value resonates across different investor types. Looking Ahead With nearly 600,000 BTC under its belt, MicroStrategy’s balance sheet is now heavily tied to Bitcoin’s performance. Their success (or lack thereof) will continue to be closely watched as a barometer for corporate crypto adoption. As long as Michael Saylor remains at the helm and the company’s strategy holds, we can likely expect further announcements of BTC accumulation. The journey of MicroStrategy and its massive Bitcoin holdings is far from over. Each purchase adds another layer to this unfolding story of corporate conviction in the digital age.

2025-06-23T17:41:19,"The Smart Money Playbook: A Look at Why Whales are Buying Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) During This Sell-off","Big players in the crypto world are making bold moves amid the market downturn. This article uncovers the reasons behind significant investments in Ethereum and Bitcoin during this sell-off. Dive in to discover which digital assets are primed for growth and why these influential investors are betting big on these cryptocurrencies. Ethereum Market Snapshot: Recent Trends and Key Levels Ethereum 's price has slid over the past month by roughly 10.84% and dropped by 35.61% over the half-year period. The price has ranged between about $1923.57 and $2961.91, signaling consistent downward pressure over recent cycles. A week-long fall of 11.71% reflects the sustained bearish influence in the market. Volatility has been heightened by negative momentum measures. The Relative Strength Index sits at 35.03, suggesting weakening buying power and the presence of selling pressure over longer intervals. Price currently trades within a tight band with nearest support at $1318.71 and resistance at $3395.40. Price action remains unsettled without a clear upward trend, as bears currently dominate market sentiment. Trading strategies may include watching for price bounces near the support level before testing resistance. Cautious buying near support with proper risk management could be beneficial, while scalping or taking short-term positions within this range may prove effective until sustained momentum shifts and bulls gain control. Bitcoin Price Review and Trading Outlook Bitcoin experienced a varied performance over the past month and six months with a slight dip in the short term and modest gains over the longer period. The coin dropped by around 5.48% during the last month and showed a decline of approximately 3.91% over just one week, indicating some short-term pressure. In contrast, the six-month change moved up by roughly 2.82%, showing that Bitcoin has maintained ground and slowly gained momentum despite recent pullbacks. These numbers point to a period of consolidation with mixed signals in its price performance across different time frames. The current price range has Bitcoin trading between roughly $94,832 and $113,326.8, bounded by key levels that can shape future price moves. The nearest support level sits at about $84,880.08 while the nearest resistance hovers around $121,869.42. Technical indicators like the Awesome Oscillator at -3281.437 and Momentum Indicator at -4654.76 lean towards bearish sentiment, although the Relative Strength Index at 39.83 suggests the coin is nearing oversold territory. There is no clear trend at this point, leaving room for range-bound trading. Traders might consider entering positions near support levels while remaining cautious of resistance zones that could limit upward moves. Conclusion ETH and BTC remain top choices for large investors even during the sell-off. Whales likely see value in both coins due to their foundational roles in the market. These assets have shown resilience and potential for future growth. Buying during the dip could be a strategic move for long-term gains. This trend indicates continued confidence in the prospects of ETH and BTC. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

After briefly sinking to $99,500, bitcoin has bounced back 2.9% in the last hour and is now trading at $102,400. The digital asset is still up 2.5% in the last 24 hours, while the CoinDesk 20 (an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins, memecoins and exchange coins) has risen 2.1% in the same period of time. Bitcoin's drop occurred as Iran retaliated against U.S. President Donald Trump's administration's weekend bombardment of three of its nuclear sites. The Middle Eastern nation carried out missile strikes against American bases in multiple Gulf countries, including Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. The attack on Qatar resulted in no casualties or injuries, according to a Qatari official. Investors appeared to be unfazed by the military action.

Our Manta price forecast expects Manta price to surge to a maximum level of $3.6 in 2025. In 2030, Manta price prediction expects Manta price to record a maximum level of $22.28.

Buyers are now aiming for a push above immediate Fib levels; however, sellers are strongly defending further surges. The 24-hour volume dropped to $3.1 million, showing a decline in interest in trading activity today. Manta is trading at $0.168, surging by over 5.8% in the last 24 hours. Manta price chart The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and hovers around 30, showing that bears are still controlling the momentum of the price. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. Manta/USDT 4-hour price chart: Bulls aim for a hold above EMA lines The 4-hour Manta price chart suggests MANTA continues to face bearish activity around EMA lines, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart. However, buyers aim for a surge by sending the price above the EMA20 trend line. MANTA price chart The BoP indicator trades in a negative region at 0, hinting that sellers are trying to build pressure near support levels and boost an upward correction. However, the MACD trend line has formed green candles above the signal line, and the indicator aims for positive momentum, strengthening bullish positions.

The hourly price chart confirms that bears are making efforts to prevent the Manta price from an immediate surge. However, if the Manta price successfully breaks above $0.192, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.226. MANTA Chart on TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Manta’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.155, resulting in a correction to $0.139. Is MANTA a good investment? Manta’s rapid rise in DeFi TVL charts and alignment with Ethereum ‘s scaling roadmap via technologies like Manta Pacific suggest $MANTA’s potential. Grants support its ecosystem growth, and it leads in ZK technology adoption, promising for blockchain ‘s future. However, regulatory concerns over transaction privacy could affect its long-term viability, potentially impacting ZK protocols like $MANTA. Overall, Manta is a good investment if you want a profitable return in the long term. Why is the Manta price up today? Manta price has triggered a strong bullish rally toward $0.168. This occurred after buyers gained confidence and accumulated heavily around $0.16. Will Manta price recover? If bulls hold the price above $0.2, we might see further recovery toward immediate resistance channels. Will Manta price reach $10? In recent months, the Manta network expanded its offerings and established multiple partnerships. If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $10 mark. Will Manta reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment, the MNT price might take several years to reach the $100 milestone. We expect the Manta price to achieve $100 by 2060. Will Manta reach $1000? $1000 is a distant dream for Manta price. However, if everything remains in favor of the altcoin market, we might even see the MNT price hitting $1K. Is Manta a good long-term investment? Investors are bullish on Manta, which has gained significant attention in recent months. If developers continue to build robust utilities for Manta and the roadmap fulfills user demand, it can be a good long-term investment option. Recent MANTA news/ opinions Kenny Li, one of the co-founders of Manta Network, was recently almost tricked by a phishing scam carried out by the well-known hacking group Lazarus. He talked about the incident in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Friday, describing how he came very close to being caught but managed to avoid it just in time. MANTA price prediction June 2025 If the altcoin market witnesses a surge in buying pressure this month, we might see a rebound in the MANTA price. In June, we expect Manta’s price to record a minimum of $0.17 and a maximum of $0.37. The average price is expected to be around $0.25. Manta Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Manta Price Prediction June 2025 $0.17 $0.25 $0.37 Manta price prediction 2025 Due to the impact of Bitcoin’s halving, Bitcoin and leading altcoins could reach new highs in 2025.

2025-06-23T17:30:20,"Market Prediction: Brace for a Sharp Summer Dip Before the Final Rally","BitcoinWorld Market Prediction: Brace for a Sharp Summer Dip Before the Final Rally The world of finance is constantly abuzz with forecasts, and one recent market prediction from macro economist and trader Henrik Zeberg has caught the attention of many, especially those watching the crypto space. Zeberg, known for his detailed macroeconomic analysis, recently shared his outlook on the broader markets, suggesting a potentially turbulent summer period before a significant final move upward. What does this mean for investors, particularly in the volatile realm of cryptocurrency? Understanding Henrik Zeberg’s Market Prediction Henrik Zeberg took to the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to lay out his expected market trajectory. His forecast paints a picture of near-term sideways movement or slight gains, followed by a notable downturn. He specifically anticipates a sharp correction hitting markets in late July or early August. This period of expected decline has been dubbed the “Summer Doldrum” by Zeberg, suggesting a potentially quiet or negative phase during the warmer months. However, his prediction doesn’t end there. Following this anticipated crypto market dip and broader market correction, Zeberg forecasts a powerful recovery and a strong final rally . This rally, in his view, is expected to lead to what is commonly referred to as a blow off top – a rapid, dramatic increase in price followed by a swift collapse. Here’s a breakdown of Zeberg’s predicted sequence: Phase 1: Slight Rise/Sideways (Short-term): Markets may see minor gains or consolidate before the main event. Phase 2: Sharp Correction (Late July/Early August): The “Summer Doldrum” characterized by a significant price decline. This is the predicted crypto market dip period. Phase 3: Strong Final Rally (Post-Doldrum): A powerful upward movement across markets. Phase 4: Blow-off Top (Culmination): The final peak of the rally, marked by parabolic price action, preceding a likely significant crash. Why a Summer Crypto Market Dip? Exploring the ‘Summer Doldrum’ The concept of a “Summer Doldrum” isn’t new in financial markets. Historically, summer months, particularly August, have sometimes shown lower trading volumes and increased volatility or sideways action. Several factors could contribute to this: Seasonal Trading Patterns: Many market participants, including institutional traders, take vacations, leading to reduced liquidity. Economic Data Lull: Sometimes, there’s a temporary slowdown in major economic data releases during peak summer months. Anticipation or Uncertainty: Markets might pause or correct as participants await key economic events or policy decisions expected in the fall. Profit Taking: After potential gains earlier in the year, some investors might choose to take profits before the typically less active summer period. While these factors can contribute to quieter or choppy markets, predicting a sharp correction like the one Zeberg suggests requires looking at specific macroeconomic or technical triggers he might be observing. Without his detailed rationale, we can infer he sees underlying conditions ripe for a significant pullback during this time. Understanding the Blow Off Top and Final Market Rally The flip side of Zeberg’s prediction is the powerful move that follows the dip: the strong final rally culminating in a blow off top . This is a critical phase for investors to understand, as it represents the potential peak of a market cycle. A blow-off top is characterized by: Rapid Price Acceleration: Prices surge upwards at an increasingly fast pace. High Volume: Trading volume often spikes dramatically as FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) kicks in. Broad Participation: Retail investors often pile in during this phase, chasing gains. Media Frenzy: The market becomes a major topic of mainstream conversation. Vertical Chart Pattern: The price chart often looks almost vertical in its final ascent. This phase is often unsustainable and is typically followed by a rapid and severe price crash. Zeberg’s forecast implies that the rally post-summer dip will be the final significant upward leg of the current market cycle before a more prolonged downturn. What Does This Market Prediction Mean for Crypto? Cryptocurrencies, while having their own unique drivers, often exhibit high correlation with broader risk-on assets like tech stocks. If Zeberg’s market prediction for traditional markets holds true, it’s reasonable to expect the crypto market to potentially follow a similar pattern, albeit with amplified volatility. Amplified Dip: A “Summer Doldrum” correction in traditional markets could translate into a more pronounced crypto market dip due to its higher beta (sensitivity to market movements). Amplified Rally: Conversely, a strong final rally and blow off top in broader markets could see cryptocurrencies experience even more parabolic gains in that final phase. Increased Volatility: The entire predicted sequence – dip, then rally, then blow-off top – could be far more volatile and rapid in the crypto space. Investors in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins should pay close attention to macro signals and technical indicators, as they often precede or coincide with significant moves in the crypto market. Navigating the Predicted Market Rally and Dip: Challenges and Actionable Insights Predicting market timing with precision is notoriously difficult. Zeberg’s analysis provides a potential roadmap, but it comes with inherent challenges: Timing Risk: The exact timing of the dip and the start/end of the rally is uncertain. Being too early or too late can significantly impact outcomes. Magnitude Uncertainty: The depth of the predicted crypto market dip and the height of the subsequent market rally and blow off top are estimates, not guarantees. External Factors: Unforeseen global events (geopolitical, economic) can derail any prediction. Correlation vs. Causation: While crypto often follows macro trends, specific crypto news or developments can cause divergence. Given these challenges, how can investors and traders approach this prediction? Actionable Insights: Stay Informed: Follow analysis from economists like Henrik Zeberg , but also consider a range of perspectives. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Understand that predictions are not guarantees. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Develop a Strategy: Decide how you would react to a significant dip (e.g., buy the dip, hold, sell). Plan for the potential of a final rally and blow-off top (e.g., profit-taking strategy). Risk Management is Key: Consider using tools like stop-losses to limit potential downside during a correction. Avoid using excessive leverage, especially during volatile periods. Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify across different assets or cryptocurrencies. Prepare for Volatility: The predicted sequence involves significant price swings. Ensure your portfolio and emotional state are prepared for this. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market perfectly, investing a fixed amount regularly can average out your purchase price over time, potentially benefiting from a dip. Conclusion: Preparing for Potential Turbulence and Opportunity Henrik Zeberg’s market prediction offers a compelling, albeit cautious, outlook for the coming months: a potential sharp summer dip followed by a powerful final market rally culminating in a blow off top . While timing and magnitude remain uncertain, understanding this potential sequence allows investors to prepare. For those in the crypto market, this forecast suggests heightened volatility, with any broader market dip likely amplified in digital assets. Similarly, the final rally could present significant opportunities, but the subsequent blow-off top carries substantial risk of a sharp reversal. Ultimately, whether Zeberg’s specific timeline plays out or not, his prediction serves as a valuable reminder of market cycles, the potential for significant corrections, and the importance of having a strategy that includes risk management. Stay vigilant, stay informed, and trade responsibly. To learn more about the latest crypto market trends, explore our article on key developments shaping the crypto market price action.

2025-06-23T17:26:07,"What Will Happen to XRP Amid Recent Declines? Here Are Two Possible Scenarios According to Analysts","Cryptocurrency analysis firm MakroVision has released its updated technical assessment of XRP, explaining that XRP is currently testing a vital support zone and that this level will be decisive for the price direction. According to MakroVision, XRP’s price structure is still in a downward trend. The analysis states that the downtrend shown by the red line remains valid, while the recent price action has reinforced this trend with lower highs and lows. In particular, the break of the support line at $2.03 has brought XRP to a critical threshold. XRP is currently in the “Golden Pocket” area (Fibonacci 0.618–0.665 range), which is considered important in technical analysis. This area covers the $1.95–2.03 band. According to the analysis, although this area is trying to stabilize the price for now, a strong buying reaction has not yet been observed. It is stated that if this level is broken, weaker supports will come into play and this could mean a bearish breakout. Related News: JUST IN: Iran Allegedly Attacks US Bases in Qatar - Bitcoin Falls Below $100,000 Again, Experiencing a Sudden Drop MakroVision outlined two possible scenarios for XRP as follows: If there is an upward reaction: It was stated that the price could rise above $2.13 again, the first target would be the liquidity zone at $2.23 and then the recent low peaks at $2.35.

That said, trading activity cooled toward the week’s end, which, according to CoinShares, is likely influenced by the Juneteenth observance in the US and reports of escalating American involvement in tensions with Iran. Despite a recent market correction, Bitcoin saw $1.1 billion in inflows for the second straight week, which indicates that investors remain confident and are buying the dip. Further highlighting this optimism, short-bitcoin investment products experienced small outflows of $1.4 million, according to the latest edition of CoinShares’ Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report. Ethereum also maintained momentum as it logged its ninth consecutive week of inflows, with $124 million added. The latest figure pushed the total for this stretch to $2.2 billion. This marks Ethereum’s longest inflow streak since mid-2021. A similar trend was seen across Solana and XRP, which gained $2.8 million and $2.7 million in new capital, respectively, in the past week. Meanwhile, Chainlink, Cardano, and Litecoin followed suit while posting smaller inflows of $0.6 million, $0.3 million, and $0.2 million, respectively.

2025-06-23T17:22:35,"Nasdaq firm eyes $100m BNB token accumulation plan: report","BNB was born as a Binance loyalty token. Now, it’s being pitched as a corporate reserve asset, thanks to a $100 million play by former Coral Capital executives. Their soon-to-be-renamed Nasdaq firm, Build & Build Corporation, could legitimize BNB in ways Binance never could—or expose its deepest flaws. On June 23, Bloomberg reported that former Coral Capital Holdings executives Patrick Horsman, Joshua Kruger, and Johnathan Pasch are in “advanced talks” to raise $100 million through a Nasdaq-listed shell company they control. The capital would be used to acquire Binance Token (BNB) en masse, positioning the token as a treasury reserve asset of the renamed firm, Build & Build Corporation. Investor materials reviewed in the report describe the strategy as a first-of-its-kind bid to turn a publicly traded company into a long-term BNB holding vehicle—a move directly inspired by Strategy’s Bitcoin ( BTC ) playbook. The trio’s plan hinges on a critical distinction: BNB, while birthed by Binance, now operates independently as the native token of the BNB Smart Chain. Read more: BTC crash was no accident: Bitcoin’s price chart warned of potential weakness The BNB gamble: can a corporate treasury overcome Binance’s shadow? The Build & Build Corporation’s $100 million bet on BNB is a high-stakes experiment in rebranding. Unlike Bitcoin, which carries no corporate affiliation, BNB remains inextricably linked to Binance in the public consciousness, despite CZ’s insistence that it operates independently as the native asset of BNB Smart Chain. This perception has been a double-edged sword: while the token powers one of the most active blockchains in crypto, its price has underperformed relative to most tokens over the past year, weighed down by Binance’s legal settlements and lingering regulatory scrutiny. BNB’s struggles are quantifiable. Since Binance’s $4.3 billion plea deal with U.S. authorities in late 2023, the token has lagged behind major peers, gaining just 6.43% year-to-date compared to Cardano’s ( ADA ) 40.28% and Tron’s ( TRX ) 126.32% and over the same period, CoinMarketCap data shows. Much of that gap stems from investor skepticism about centralization. According to a 2017 whitepaper, BNB’s initial distribution allocated 80 million tokens (worth roughly $50 billion today) to Binance’s founding team, including CZ. Though the exchange has burned tokens periodically to reduce supply, critics argue BNB’s governance remains opaque compared to fully decentralized alternatives. Adding to BNB’s dismal performance is the shadow of recent enforcement actions against Binance and its co-founder Changpeng Zhao, who pleaded guilty to federal charges in November 2023. Whether Build & Build can isolate BNB from these narratives and convince public markets to see it as an institutional-grade treasury asset remains an open and risky bet.

2025-06-23T17:20:20,"Strategic Bitcoin Treasury: Sequans Communications Raises $384M for Corporate Bitcoin Holding","BitcoinWorld Strategic Bitcoin Treasury: Sequans Communications Raises $384M for Corporate Bitcoin Holding In a surprising and strategic move that underscores the growing interest in digital assets beyond traditional finance, Sequans Communications , a prominent provider of 5G/4G IoT semiconductor solutions, has announced ambitious plans to significantly bolster its corporate treasury with Bitcoin . This development signals a notable step for an IoT company venturing into the volatile yet potentially rewarding world of cryptocurrency holdings for treasury management purposes. What Exactly is a Bitcoin Treasury Initiative? For many companies, the corporate treasury functions primarily to manage the firm’s financial assets, ensuring liquidity, mitigating risk, and optimizing returns on idle cash. Traditionally, this involves holding cash, short-term government bonds, or other low-risk financial instruments. A Bitcoin treasury initiative represents a departure from this conservative approach. It involves a company allocating a portion of its corporate funds to hold Bitcoin as a treasury asset. This decision is often driven by several factors: Inflation Hedge: Concerns about fiat currency devaluation leading companies to seek alternative stores of value. Potential for Appreciation: The belief that Bitcoin ‘s price could increase significantly over time, offering potentially higher returns than traditional assets. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset (or less correlated) to the traditional mix of treasury holdings. Signaling: Demonstrating forward-thinking or belief in the future of digital assets. While high-profile examples like MicroStrategy have aggressively pursued this strategy, it remains relatively uncommon, especially for companies outside the direct financial or crypto sectors. This makes Sequans Communications ‘ announcement particularly noteworthy. Sequans Communications’ Bold Financial Strategy According to a press release shared on Newsfile, Sequans Communications intends to raise a substantial $384 million specifically earmarked for this Bitcoin treasury initiative. This isn’t a small, speculative allocation; it represents a significant financial undertaking for the company. The funding structure is planned as follows: Funding Method Amount Details Equity Securities $195 million Issuance of shares, potentially diluting existing shareholders but raising direct capital. Convertible Secured Debentures $189 million Debt that can be converted into equity under certain conditions, secured against company assets. Total Raise $384 million Capital targeted for the Bitcoin treasury initiative. This dual approach to fundraising allows Sequans to tap into different investor pools while securing the necessary capital for its ambitious plan. The use of convertible debentures also suggests a level of flexibility depending on future market conditions and the company’s performance. Partnering with Swan Bitcoin for Treasury Management Managing a significant holding of a volatile asset like Bitcoin requires specialized expertise, particularly concerning security, custody, and execution of purchases. Sequans Communications plans to address this by partnering with Swan Bitcoin , a company known for its focus on accumulating and holding Bitcoin . While the exact details of the partnership weren’t fully elaborated in the initial announcement, it’s likely that Swan Bitcoin will assist Sequans with: Secure custody solutions for the acquired Bitcoin . Execution of large-scale Bitcoin purchases efficiently. Reporting and management of the Bitcoin treasury position. Leveraging a specialized partner like Swan allows Sequans to focus on its core business – developing cutting-edge cellular IoT technology – while entrusting the complexities of managing a corporate Bitcoin holding to experts. What Does This Mean for an IoT Company Like Sequans? Sequans Communications operates in the Internet of Things (IoT) space, providing modem chips and solutions for various connected devices, from smart meters to asset trackers. Their core business is technology development and sales, not financial asset management. This move into a Bitcoin treasury represents a significant strategic pivot or, at the very least, a major diversification of their corporate finance strategy. It suggests that the company’s leadership sees potential value in Bitcoin that outweighs the associated risks of price volatility. For an IoT company Bitcoin exposure at this scale is quite unusual. Potential benefits for Sequans could include: Potential appreciation of the Bitcoin holdings, adding value to the company’s balance sheet. Acting as a hedge against inflation, preserving the purchasing power of their corporate reserves. Attracting investors interested in companies with exposure to digital assets. However, there are also significant challenges and risks: Market Volatility: The price of Bitcoin is notoriously volatile, which could lead to significant paper losses on their treasury holdings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for corporate crypto holdings is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Execution Risk: Successfully raising the capital and executing the large Bitcoin purchases without negatively impacting the market requires careful planning. Shareholder Perception: Some shareholders might view this as a risky departure from the core business. The Broader Picture: Corporate Bitcoin Adoption The decision by Sequans Communications , an IoT company , to pursue a large-scale corporate Bitcoin initiative adds another data point to the slowly growing trend of companies exploring or adopting Bitcoin for their treasury. While still a small fraction of the corporate world, the list of companies holding Bitcoin is becoming more diverse. This trend is closely watched by both the crypto community and traditional finance professionals. Each new company, particularly those outside the finance sector like Sequans, provides further validation (in the eyes of proponents) of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class for corporate balance sheets. It raises questions for other companies: Should we consider a similar strategy? What percentage of our treasury, if any, should be in Bitcoin ? What are the tax and accounting implications? Who are the reliable partners for custody and management, like Swan Bitcoin ? Sequans’ move, if successful, could potentially encourage other non-financial companies to explore the possibility of adding Bitcoin to their treasury holdings, further driving corporate Bitcoin adoption. Conclusion: A Bold Step for Sequans and Corporate Bitcoin Sequans Communications ‘ plan to raise $384 million for a Bitcoin treasury initiative, partnering with Swan Bitcoin , is a bold and potentially transformative step for the IoT company . It highlights the increasing consideration of Bitcoin as a viable treasury asset, even for firms whose core business is far removed from the crypto space. While the strategy comes with inherent risks associated with Bitcoin ‘s volatility, it also presents the potential for significant upside and a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainties. As Sequans navigates this ambitious plan, the market will be watching closely to see how this venture into corporate Bitcoin impacts its financial position and sets a precedent for other technology companies. This move by Sequans is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a statement about the evolving perception of digital assets in the corporate world and could pave the way for broader adoption of Bitcoin treasury strategies in the future.

2025-06-23T17:10:20,"US Dollar Surges: Understanding the Safe-Haven Rally Amidst Geopolitical Tension","BitcoinWorld US Dollar Surges: Understanding the Safe-Haven Rally Amidst Geopolitical Tension In the dynamic world of global finance, events far beyond traditional economic indicators can send ripples through markets. For those navigating the cryptocurrency space, understanding these macro forces is key. Recent US strikes targeting Iranian nuclear sites triggered a notable Market Reaction , particularly impacting the Forex Market and leading to a strengthening of the US Dollar . But why does a geopolitical event like this make the world’s reserve currency firm up? What is a Safe-Haven Asset? When uncertainty grips the globe, investors often seek refuge in assets perceived as stable and reliable. These are known as Safe-Haven assets. Their value is expected to hold or even increase during times of market turbulence or economic downturns. Historically, gold has been a classic Safe-Haven asset. Government bonds of stable economies (like US Treasuries) are also considered safe. Certain currencies, primarily the US Dollar , also fall into this category due to the size and stability of the US economy and its role in global trade and finance. The Geopolitical Tension arising from the strikes prompted a shift in investor sentiment, driving capital towards perceived safety. How Does Geopolitical Tension Impact the US Dollar? Escalating Geopolitical Tension introduces unpredictability. This uncertainty makes riskier assets (like stocks or even some cryptocurrencies) less attractive. Investors tend to move their funds into more liquid and seemingly secure assets. The US Dollar benefits from this flight to safety for several reasons: Global Reserve Currency: Much of international trade and finance is conducted in USD. It’s the most liquid currency globally. Size and Stability of the US Economy: Despite its challenges, the US economy is vast and relatively stable compared to many others. US Treasury Market: The deep and liquid market for US government debt provides a place for large sums of money to be parked securely. Following the strikes, this dynamic played out as expected, causing the US Dollar to firm against other major currencies in the Forex Market . Understanding the Market Reaction Beyond Forex While the Forex Market showed a clear response with the strengthening US Dollar , the Market Reaction was broader. Other assets also moved: Asset Class Typical Reaction to Geopolitical Tension Observed Reaction Post-Strikes US Dollar Strengthens (Safe-Haven) Firmed significantly Gold Strengthens (Safe-Haven) Saw upward pressure Oil Increases (Supply Concerns) Experienced volatility/rise Stock Markets Weakens (Risk-Off Sentiment) Showed cautious or negative movement Cryptocurrencies Mixed/Uncertain (Often follows risk assets, but ‘digital gold’ narrative exists) Varied reaction, often initial dip then recovery This interconnectedness highlights how geopolitical events create a chain reaction across different financial sectors, including impacting the sentiment around cryptocurrencies. What Does a Strong US Dollar Mean for Crypto? For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, a strong US Dollar has implications: Bitcoin Price: Bitcoin is often priced against the USD. A strengthening USD can, in some scenarios, put downward pressure on Bitcoin’s USD price if demand doesn’t keep pace. However, Bitcoin’s own ‘digital gold’ or Safe-Haven narrative can sometimes counteract this, leading to complex price movements. Stablecoins: Stablecoins like USDT, USDC, and BUSD are pegged to the US Dollar . Their stability relies on maintaining this peg, and their value remains tied to the USD’s strength. Increased demand for USD as a Safe-Haven can indirectly affect the dynamics around stablecoins as they are the primary on-ramps/off-ramps between crypto and the USD world. Capital Flows: If global capital is flowing into USD assets, it might draw some investment away from more speculative assets like certain altcoins in the short term. Understanding the drivers behind US Dollar strength is crucial for anticipating potential shifts in the crypto landscape. Actionable Insights for Investors Navigating markets influenced by Geopolitical Tension requires careful consideration: Stay Informed: Monitor global events and understand their potential impact on traditional markets and, consequently, crypto. Assess Risk Tolerance: Geopolitical events increase volatility. Ensure your portfolio aligns with your comfort level for risk. Diversification: Consider diversifying across different asset classes, understanding that not all assets react the same way to tension. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term reactions to Market Reaction s can be sharp, maintain a focus on your long-term investment goals. Conclusion: The Dollar’s Enduring Role in Uncertainty The recent firming of the US Dollar following strikes on Iranian nuclear sites serves as a clear example of its role as a perceived Safe-Haven asset during times of heightened Geopolitical Tension . This event underscores the interconnectedness of global finance, where actions in one part of the world can trigger significant reactions in the Forex Market and beyond, influencing everything from traditional currencies to the complex world of cryptocurrencies. While crypto markets have their own unique drivers, macro events like these are vital pieces of the puzzle that every investor should consider.

2025-06-23T17:04:25,"Strategy Expands Holdings as Metaplanet Unveils Bold Bitcoin Plan","Michael Saylor, the chairman of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), has added more Bitcoin (BTC) to the company’s growing collection. At the same time, Metaplanet, another Bitcoin-focused company, has revealed an ambitious plan to hold hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins by 2027. As Bitcoin’s price shifts, these companies remain firm in believing that the digital currency is a powerful long-term asset. Strategy Adds More Bitcoin Despite Price Dip Shortly after hinting at more Bitcoin buys , Michael Saylor shared that Strategy has purchased an additional 245 Bitcoins for around $26 million. Each digital coin was bought at an average price of $105,856. This brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 592,345 BTC. These were acquired for about $41.87 billion and are now worth nearly $60 billion. In the post, Saylor shared the update with an image showing Strategy’s history of Bitcoin purchases. Each buy is marked with an orange dot, the color often linked to Bitcoin. Saylor said, “Nothing Stops This Orange,” meaning the company will continue its Bitcoin buying spree. Meanwhile, shortly after the Strategy’s latest buy-up, the Bitcoin price dropped below $100,000 , meaning the company bought the coin at a higher rate. According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin is currently trading at $101,554, up by 2.26% in the last 24 hours. Furthermore, Saylor revealed that the Nasdaq-listed firm has earned a return of 19.2% on its Bitcoin investment so far this year. This strong result supports the company’s decision to continue buying. Metaplanet Takes a Bigger Step Forward While Strategy’s latest purchase is significant, Metaplanet, a Japan-based investment firm, made an even bigger move. The same day Saylor shared his update, the company announced it had bought 1,111 Bitcoins for roughly $118.2 million. Each Bitcoin was acquired at an average of $106,408. This brings Metaplanet’s total holdings to 11,111 BTC. These were purchased for about $1.07 billion and are now valued at over $1.12 billion. The company has seen a strong return, reporting a 306.7% yield this year, far above most market averages. Metaplanet Shares A Vision to Hold 210,000 Bitcoin Metaplanet is not stopping there. The company’s CEO, Simon Gerovich, recently shared a bold plan to raise $5.4 billion to purchase Bitcoin. He said the company aims to hold over 210,000 Bitcoins by 2027. According to this plan, Metaplanet wants to grow its Bitcoin treasury step by step. First, it plans to increase its holdings to 30,000 Bitcoins by the end of this year. After that, the company aims to reach 100,000 Bitcoins by the end of 2026. Finally, it hopes to hit its target of 201,112 BTC by the close of 2027. If successful, Metaplanet would become one of the largest Bitcoin holders in the world.

2025-06-23T17:01:00,"Bitcoin Treasury Boom Becomes New Altcoin Season, Says Adam Back","Bitcoin Treasuries Replace Altcoins for Crypto Speculators Rising public company use of Bitcoin treasuries is revolutionizing crypto speculation, Blockstream CEO and inventor of Hashcash Adam Back informed this news outlet. In an article published on June 23, Back stated that “Bitcoin treasury season is the new ALT SZN,” and urged investors to exit altcoins and into BTC or firms stockpiling Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Public Companies Betting Big on Bitcoin Back’s comments follow a corporate Bitcoin buying spree. At least 240 listed corporations own Bitcoin as of late June—up from just 124 firms weeks before—accounting for nearly 4% of total BTC supply, as tracked by BitcoinTreasuries.NET. The firms are utilizing various financing methods, such as convertible note offerings, to purchase more Bitcoin and boost the value of their stocks. Strategic Play: Reclaiming Altcoin Losses As Back phrased it, Bitcoin treasury firms could also present altcoin buyers with a strategic point of entry to retrieve losses. “Perhaps they could offset their losses by converting to BTC via treasury companies,” he tweeted back. Corporate Momentum Gathers Pace The trend is picking up speed. Nasdaq-listed Mercurity Fintech will raise $800 million for a long-term BTC reserve fund, and Paris-based The Blockchain Group will accumulate $340 million for the same purpose. These moves are a sign of institutional trust in Bitcoin as a long-term vehicle. Altcoins Still in the Picture—For Now Despite speculative momentum having been lost, altcoins are not out of the spotlight entirely. On June 11, Interactive Strength, a fitness technology firm, said it would raise $500 million to build a Fetch.ai (FET) token treasury, showing selective institutional demand remains present. Bitcoin as a $200 Trillion Opportunity Back has been a Bitcoin dominance prophet for years, predicting that it could be a $200 trillion market with institutions and governments rushing in. Hyperbitcoinization is still on paper, but the sharp rise of BTC treasuries might be the strongest signal yet of the growing power of Bitcoin in the world financial system.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/bitcoin-treasury-boom-becomes-new-altcoin-season/,"ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION","Bitcoin|Regulation",cryptocompare

In a new filing with the Office of the Maine Attorney General, the Michigan-based McLaren Health Care says 743,131 Americans are impacted by a major cybersecurity incident. The firm says an unknown threat actor gained access to McLaren’s database and stole patient information, which may include names, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, medical histories and health insurance records. “On or about August 5, 2024, McLaren became aware of suspicious activity related to certain McLaren/Karmanos computer systems and they immediately activated their emergency response processes. Additionally, McLaren launched an investigation with the assistance of third-party forensic specialists to secure their network and to determine the nature and scope of the activity. Through the investigation, it was determined that there was unauthorized access to the network between July 17, 2024, and August 3, 2024. As part of the investigation, McLaren undertook an extensive forensic review of the potentially impacted files to determine whether any sensitive information was present. It was through this process, which concluded on May 5, 2025, that McLaren determined that personal information and protected health information pertaining to individuals was contained within the files involved.” McLaren is a $7.3 billion health care delivery system that oversees 12 hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and imaging centers along with a network of primary and specialty care doctors. The firm says it sent letters of notification to patients affected by the data breach, while offering free credit monitoring services through IDX for 12 months. For now, McLaren says that it is reviewing its security protocols and implementing additional technical safeguards to avoid a potential repeat of the incident.

2025-06-23T16:43:38,"How Ben Armstrong turned BitBoy crypto into a brand — then lost it all","How did Ben Armstrong turn BitBoy Crypto into one of the loudest voices in crypto, and what finally caused the persona, platform, and man behind it to unravel? Table of Contents Crypto’s loudest voice, silenced by the law The rise of a retail-friendly influencer Bitboy’s reputation in freefall The cost of staying relevant Crypto’s loudest voice, silenced by the law In March 2025, Ben Armstrong, known widely as BitBoy Crypto, became the focus of a legal and reputational collapse that had been building over several years. Once among the most prominent figures in crypto media, Armstrong is now in custody at the Volusia County Branch Jail in Florida, facing felony charges tied to written threats against a sitting judge. As of June 2025, court records indicate that his case remains unresolved, with a psychiatric evaluation delaying his bail hearing until early July. The arrest was formally logged on Mar. 25 and confirmed the next day through a statement issued by the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office. Local coverage from multiple outlets verified the report in a live broadcast. Four days before his arrest, Armstrong had publicly acknowledged the warrant in a post on X, saying he was “facing a warrant but fighting for justice.” I can now confirm that the warrants for my arrest are due to me sending emails (as my own attorney by the way) to the DISHONORABLE Kimberly Childs of @cobbcountygovt who has NOW DELETED her Twitter lmao. Public officials hiding corruption one day at a time. — The BitBoy (@BenArmstrongsX) March 21, 2025 Unsealed court documents from Georgia show that Armstrong is being prosecuted under Florida Statute 836.10, facing two felony counts for making written threats to kill or injure. The threats were reportedly directed at Judge Kimberly Childs of Cobb County’s Superior Court. Each charge carries a potential prison sentence of 5 to 10 years. The ongoing situation has also attracted regulatory attention. In June 2024, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued a subpoena to HIT Network, Armstrong’s former media employer. The agency is investigating undisclosed token promotions, including Armstrong’s personal involvement in multiple memecoins, that took place between 2021 and 2023. Despite Armstrong’s detention, updates continue to appear on his official X account. His team has been posting messages encouraging followers to share support. A pinned post dated Jun. 7 invited the public to send letters of encouragement as legal proceedings continue. If anyone would like to include a positive message to Ben in a letter please comment it below. Thank you 🙏 — The BitBoy (@BenArmstrongsX) June 6, 2025 The rise of a retail-friendly influencer Armstrong’s involvement in crypto dates back to October 2012, when he purchased 0.5 Bitcoin ( BTC ) at $12.50 per coin. He later referenced this early purchase in a 2019 post on X, identifying it as his entry point into the crypto space. Before turning to crypto full-time, he operated a digital marketing business under the name Ben Armstrong Designs. During the same period, he worked with a rehabilitation center in Atlanta called Three Dimensional Life. The transition into crypto content creation began in April 2018 with the launch of the BitBoy Crypto YouTube channel. The platform grew steadily and surpassed 1 million subscribers by early 2022. Viewer engagement was consistently high, with estimated monthly watch hours reaching over 1.5 million. Armstrong expanded his presence by partnering with a range of blockchain companies, including promotional deals with Binance and several smaller crypto projects. His content strategy combined daily market updates, token reviews, and sponsored videos, distributed across platforms such as X and Telegram. The model reflected the rise of the influencer economy in crypto, where visibility and reach translated directly into revenue opportunities. During this period, Armstrong’s public image remained largely positive. His consistent posting schedule and beginner-friendly tone helped him build a loyal audience, positioning him as a familiar voice in an increasingly crowded content space. Bitboy’s reputation in freefall Concerns about Armstrong’s business practices began to surface more prominently in early 2023. In March, a Reddit post leaked what appeared to be his promotional rate card. The post alleged that Armstrong charged $40,000 for YouTube reviews, $20,000 for mentions on X, and $10,000 for Telegram promotions. The leak renewed scrutiny around several crypto projects he had promoted, many of which later collapsed or faced regulatory action. These included DISTX, which shut down in May 2023 with reported investor losses of $1.2 million; HEX, labeled a Ponzi scheme by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in June 2023; and SAFEMOON, which was charged with fraud by U.S. regulators in November 2023. On-chain data from Etherscan also showed that insider wallets moved 8 million SAFEMOON tokens shortly after Armstrong publicly endorsed the project. In June 2023, Armstrong launched his own meme token called BEN. The token reached a peak price of $0.000011 by July 1 but declined to around $0.0000067 by the end of the year, a loss of more than 85%. Data from Nansen indicated that 12.3 million tokens were offloaded by early holders during the downturn. In August 2023, blockchain researcher ZachXBT published an investigation detailing millions in undisclosed promotional payments tied to Armstrong. 1/ Let’s review all the direct scams Bitboy has worked with in the past. Just in case you forgot here is the flyer with how much he charges. I received this a while back by posing as a project interested in a promotion. 🧵 👇 pic.twitter.com/FkC9HUDGsc — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) January 3, 2022 The report highlighted two projects, MYX and LOCK, both of which were abandoned within weeks of promotion. Investor losses from those two alone were estimated at over $1 million, based on data compiled by community analysts. Armstrong’s role at HIT Network officially ended in August 2023. An internal memo cited gross misconduct, referencing a July incident during which he appeared visibly intoxicated while livestreaming. Subscriber data from Social Blade showed a loss of 150,000 followers in the week that followed. Financial records later leaked to the media showed a revenue decline from $500,000 per month in 2022 to $50,000 by November 2023. In December 2024, reports stated that Armstrong owed HIT Network $250,000 in outstanding obligations. The cost of staying relevant Between early 2024 and early 2025, Ben Armstrong’s public and private life became increasingly unstable, shaped by legal pressure, financial strain, and growing media exposure. In February 2024, he participated in a boxing match in Mexico City during a Karate Combat event, where he faced off against memecoin promoter Carlos “More Light” Rodriguez. The event attracted attention on X and triggered rapid price fluctuations in several tokens. BEN briefly surged by nearly 90%, while HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu dropped over 20% within hours. Both tokens saw steep declines shortly afterward. Combined, they lost several million dollars in market value within days. In March 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued a public advisory warning investors about the risks of influencer-led token events and short-term promotional campaigns. Armstrong’s personal challenges deepened during this period. In January 2025, his divorce was finalized in Fulton County, Georgia, following a year-long separation. Court documents showed $180,000 in unpaid alimony and child support. A GoFundMe campaign launched in December 2024 raised $14,800 from 1,350 donors, citing legal and medical expenses as its purpose. Legal issues escalated in March 2025, when Armstrong was arrested outside his partner’s residence in Deltona, Florida. Law enforcement records described a domestic dispute. He was charged in a separate case involving felony threats against a judge. What began as a well-timed entry into Bitcoin for Armstrong eventually grew into a multi-million-dollar media platform. Over time, the pressure to remain visible overtook the motivations that once grounded his work. Promotions became entangled with financial risk, content blurred into personal conflict, and public trust eroded under mounting legal and reputational damage. In the end, Armstrong’s story is less about crypto misadventures and more about what influence without restraint can become in an ecosystem still learning where its boundaries should be.",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/the-rise-and-fall-of-bitboy-crypto-ben-armstrong/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING","Feature|Influencers|Twitter",cryptocompare

Its cost basis for those coins sits at about $95,869 each. Metaplanet’s shares dipped 3.5% on the day of the announcement, a sign that investors may be worried about how the firm is funding its buy-ups. Source: Metaplanet Funding Through Bonds And Shares Based on reports, the company has raised cash via zero-coupon bonds and equity rights since January. It issued over 210 million shares under a program it calls the “210 Million Plan.” Evo Fund has snapped up many of those bonds and rights. Between May and June 2025, Metaplanet pulled in over $300 million, earmarking every dollar for more Bitcoin. Ambitious Target Of 210,000 BTC Metaplanet has set a goal to hold 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. That is 10 times its current pile. To reach that number, it will need to keep tapping the capital markets—and it plans to. The firm even created a dedicated Bitcoin Treasury Operations arm in December 2024, moving away from its hotel management roots. Related Reading: Stablecoin Wars Ignite: Peter Schiff Champions Gold-Backed Digital Assets Dilution And Risk For Shareholders Metaplanet’s fully diluted share count rose to close to 760 million as of June 23. That puts its Bitcoin per 1,000 shares at 0.0146 BTC. More bonds and shares mean more dilution for existing investors. If Bitcoin’s price slips, the cost of raising money could climb, eating into any gains from the crypto itself. Metaplanet’s approach mirrors what some other big holders have done. It’s a bold stance. If Bitcoin holds up or heads higher, the firm could see big returns. But it will need to balance fresh capital raises against the risk of pushing down its own stock. For now, Metaplanet shows no sign of slowing down its Bitcoin buying. The only real question is how far this strategy can run before the bills come due.

Key support at $3.12 is holding, with oversold RSI and rising volume pointing to more upside. After an extended correction, Story ( IP ) has finally shown a meaningful bounce, climbing 11.83% and reclaiming a crucial resistance level. The current market structure suggests the bottom may be in, especially with volume surging and RSI exiting oversold territory. Price action has now broken above $3.12, a region aligned with the point of control and prior high timeframe resistance. As long as price holds this level, the door remains open for a continued rally toward $4.17, and possibly higher.

This area aligned closely with high timeframe support at $2.61, which held across multiple daily candle closes, suggesting accumulation at the base. The follow-through came with an impulsive breakout candle, pushing price above $3.12 and confirming a short-term shift in trend. The $3.12 region is significant.

Combined with the surge in volume at support, in stark contrast to the low-volume grind during the downtrend, this signals that demand has returned. The next resistance sits at $4.17, a natural target for the current leg. A move to this level would represent a further 32% gain from current prices. If bullish momentum remains, $4.90 becomes the next macro target, with the potential for a full trend rotation. What to expect in the coming price action If IP continues to close above $3.12 with strong volume, a rally toward $4.17 looks increasingly likely. Watch for consolidation or impulsive continuation in this zone, both will reveal the next major move.

2025-06-23T16:26:24,"Bitcoin regains key support above $100K, IP leads altcoin recovery","Bitcoin continued to recover above $100,000 from its weekend crash after a short-lived downturn as the US entered the Iran-Israel war At the time of writing, the total crypto market capitalisation was staging a recovery, rising nearly 3.5% to $3.25 trillion. Market sentiment also improved, with the Fear & Greed Index climbing back to a neutral reading of 47 after slipping into fear territory over the weekend. Bitcoin’s rebound helped lift broader market sentiment, triggering a modest recovery across major altcoins, most of which were trading in the green by late Asian hours on Monday. Why is Bitcoin going up? Bitcoin’s recovery appears closely tied to how global markets interpreted the weekend’s military escalation in the Middle East. After a brief sell-off during the initial reports of US and Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, risk sentiment began to stabilise as investors assessed the likelihood of a prolonged conflict. The joint airstrikes, targeting Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan with over 125 aircraft, marked a significant escalation. However, Iran’s immediate retaliation, which included missile and drone attacks on Israeli cities and threats toward US military bases in the Gulf, was met with limited follow-through. President Trump later signalled a pause in further US military action, easing fears of a broader regional war. His statement came as global leaders called for restraint and sought diplomatic avenues to contain the crisis. Meanwhile, Iran’s foreign minister flew to Moscow on Sunday for emergency consultations, highlighting Tehran’s interest in involving key allies before escalating further. The recovery was not driven by sentiment alone. As Bitcoin climbed back above $101,000, derivatives data pointed to a wave of short liquidations that likely added momentum to the move. A 12-hour liquidation heatmap from Binance revealed a dense cluster of short positions between $101,000 and $102,000. As the price pushed into this range, forced liquidations began to cascade, triggering a short squeeze that helped accelerate Bitcoin’s rebound. Binance BTC/USDT 12-hour Liquidation Heatmap. Source: CoinGlass. These liquidation events occur when over-leveraged traders are forced to buy back into the market to cover their positions, creating rapid upward pressure. The short squeeze not only amplified the price move but also helped restore confidence among spot buyers. Support now appears to be building around the $100,000 level, where buyer interest and previous liquidation zones converge. If momentum holds, short-term upside targets could range between $104,000 and $106,000, areas marked by prior resistance and increased liquidation density on heatmaps. Bitcoin price outlook Recent data suggests Bitcoin may be entering a more mature phase, marked by greater price stability and resilience to macroeconomic shocks. Despite heightened geopolitical tension following the US–Israel airstrikes on Iran, Bitcoin’s volatility remained subdued, which is a notable shift from its historically erratic reactions to global crises. As of June 23, Bitcoin’s 60-day realised volatility had fallen to around 27–28%, according to Bitwise Europe’s André Dragosch. This stands out even more in contrast to traditional equity benchmarks. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 recorded higher 60-day realised volatilities of roughly 30% and 35%, respectively, while the so-called “Magnificent 7” tech stocks saw volatility levels nearing 40%. While Bitcoin did drop nearly 6% over the weekend, falling below $100,000 during the initial news of the US bombing campaign, the move was relatively contained. Instead of knee-jerk selling, the market responded with composure, another hint that Bitcoin is maturing from a volatile outlier to a structured macro asset. Analysts attribute this growing stability to the rise of long-term holders and institutional involvement. According to Glassnode, over 30% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply is now held by just 216 entities, including ETFs, custodians, exchanges, and corporate treasuries. At the same time, the total supply held by long-term holders reached a record high of 14.53 million BTC as of June 23, close to 70% of the total 21 million cap. Long-term holders tend to react less to short-term news cycles, allowing Bitcoin to behave more like a macro asset rather than a speculative token. Analysts, including Arthur Hayes and OSL’s Eugene Cheung, see further upside for Bitcoin. They cite ongoing central bank liquidity, institutional inflows, and structural supply constraints as long-term drivers that could sustain BTC’s climb above $100,000. On a shorter timeframe, pseudonymous analyst Crypto Caesar pointed to a potential double bottom forming just above the $102,900 level, a structure that often precedes trend reversals. According to a 1-day BTC/USDT chart the analyst shared earlier today, if Bitcoin maintains support above this zone and breaks through the $104,000–$106,000 resistance band, it could make a run toward the $112,000 “weak high” marked by earlier liquidity. BTC/USDT 1-day price chart. Caesar also outlined a second scenario in which Bitcoin retests the $96,000–$92,000 demand zone before rebounding. However, in both scenarios, the broader technical outlook remains intact, with momentum favouring continued upside unless key support levels break decisively. Another bullish case for Bitcoin was presented by veteran analyst Gert van Lagen, who echoed earlier observations about cleared liquidity around the $100,000 mark. He noted that the short liquidation clusters had shifted toward the all-time high zone, reinforcing the idea that this area could act as a strong price magnet and fuel a potential short squeeze.

2025-06-23T16:22:44,"Veda locks $18m to push vault-based DeFi beyond the crypto bubble","DeFi’s complexity has long been a barrier to mainstream adoption. Veda, which hit $3.5 billion in TVL within eight months by abstracting that complexity, just raised $18 million to scale its vault system across a broader class of financial platforms. On June 23, DeFi infrastructure firm Veda announced an $18 million funding round led by CoinFund, with participation from Coinbase Ventures, Animoca Ventures, GSR, Mantle EcoFund, BitGo, Draper Dragon, and other heavyweight investors. https://twitter.com/veda_labs/status/1937130381465039310 The capital injection comes as Veda sharpens its focus beyond crypto-native ecosystems, aiming to embed its vault-based infrastructure into a wider range of financial platforms. Since its early 2024 launch, the infrastructure provider’s modular vault system has gained traction, processing deposits from over 100,000 users and integrating with dozens of protocols. Its vault framework, which abstracts the complexity of DeFi yield generation, is now being positioned as core infrastructure for wallets, fintech apps, and exchanges. You might also like: Strategy adds to $60b Bitcoin bet with 245 BTC bought at $105.9k Rewriting DeFi’s playbook for mainstream finance Veda’s rapid ascent to $3.5 billion in total value locked reveals a fundamental truth about DeFi’s next phase: the winning protocols won’t be those that shout the loudest, but those that mask complexity the most effectively. The startup’s vault system operates like a financial API layer, handling cross-chain yield strategies, risk management, and execution while allowing integrated platforms, such as DeFi protocols and traditional fintech apps, to present users with a familiar interface. The idea is simple: let the app control the user experience, while Veda handles the backend complexity that DeFi typically exposes. At its core, Veda’s technology standardizes yield-bearing activities, such as staking, restaking, and liquidity provisioning, into modular smart contracts that apps can plug into without rebuilding the wheel. This explains why protocols like Ether.fi and Mantle have adopted its vaults as foundational components rather than competitive products. The vaults’ interoperability has turned them into a shared primitive, similar to how AWS became the invisible backbone for web applications. Veda’s goal isn’t to make DeFi more visible. It’s to render it invisible. For developers, that means fewer maintenance and composability headaches. For platforms, it means scalable, yield-generating features that don’t require educating users on the risks of DeFi or bridging across chains. And for users, it could mean earning yield or staking rewards through the same interfaces they already trust.

2025-06-23T16:19:44,"Bitcoin Dominance Peaks at New Local High: Are Altcoins Doomed?","Holding altcoins has generally been the kiss of death for most investors this crypto cycle. While Bitcoin (BTC) has stood firm through the most difficult of geopolitical and economic headwinds, the altcoins have been hit hard just about every time. Is there any way back for alts, or will the institutional money ignore them and continue to heavily back $BTC? Bitcoin Dominance just continues up and to the right Source: TradingView The Bitcoin Dominance chart (BTC.D) reveals that dominance has been moving up and to the right since September 2022. Having just made yet another local high, dominance is currently knocking on the door of the 65.6% resistance. Once and if this is breached, the next resistances are at 68% and 70.3%, with 73.6% marking a new macro higher high. Looking to the future, many investors must be beginning to wonder if the combined altcoin market will ever be able to take the limelight from Bitcoin for any extended period of time, like it did in the past. Total3 at critical support Source: TradingView Given the woes of Ethereum, the Total3 chart can provide some clues as to how the altcoins could perform over the next week or so. It can be seen that Total3 is at a very critical juncture. The support at $775 billion is absolutely crucial for the bulls to hold, and is bolstered by the top of a previous bull flag. However, if Total3 should fall through here, $670 billion would be the next major support level. Will $SOL fall through the last major support? Source: TradingView A key canary in the coal mine for the altcoins is $SOL , given that the Solana blockchain is responsible for the vast majority of transactions across all major altcoin networks. It can be seen in the weekly chart for $SOL that the price has sunk into the very strong and critical band of support that stretches down to $125. With the Stochastic RSI indicator lines heading downwards, the price may well fall through this last major support and head down to $100, and even possibly down to $75. That said, if $BTC is able to turn things around, which is quite likely given that the bull market cycle has probably not finished, the maxim of “lifting all boats” would most certainly apply to $SOL, giving this layer 1 leader the potential to rise back to its previous highs.

2025-06-23T16:00:00,"Ethereum (ETH) Mirrors Bitcoin’s 2017–2021 Pattern with $4,000 in Sight as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Gears Up to Make Early Backers Rich","Ethereum’s recent price movement has analysts drawing parallels to Bitcoin’s historic 2017–2021 rally, and while ETH flirts with a possible breakout toward $4,000, the real conversation is beginning to shift. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising DeFi protocol still in its early presale phase, is rapidly emerging as a potential game-changer and is already being watched by seasoned crypto investors looking for the next big cryptocurrency before it hits the mainstream radar. At present, Mutuum Finance has sold out over 40% of phase-5 of its presale. The project has already received more than 11 million and has drawn close to 12,300 investors. Ethereum Echoes Bitcoin’s 2017–2021 Consolidation as $4,000 Lurks Ethereum is now sitting at 2,553 and looks exactly like the classic pres-parabolic configuration in 2017-2021 on Bitcoin. According to renowned analyst Ted Pillows and others, what has now occurred is that ETH has wrapped into a small trade range and is being held at $2,400-2,600 as an initial support leading to possible breakout at higher values above the 2,800-2,775 range. An action through that level may trigger an imminent rise to the $4,000 ceiling, rejuvenating the altcoin market activity. Nonetheless, this bullish situation might be postponed by macro uncertainties, which cover both geopolitical and economic levels. Making this wait even more tense is a muttered, little known player: Mutuum Finance (MUTM), who has managed to attract new interest of early-stage investors. Mutuum Finance is Reinventing DeFi Lending, using a Dual-Model System Mutuum Finance is set to establish a new standard in decentralized finance and introduce the next-generation lending protocol to offer the best of both worlds, combining the Profits of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. Within the P2C system, lending pool and interest rate auto-update to reflect the current market trends through the intervention of automated smart contracts. This will offer a stable and predictable set of returns to lenders and consistent set of terms to borrowers, which is sorely lacking in DeFi lending. The P2P model, on the contrary, eliminates middlemen, which enables borrowers and lenders to access each other. The model is particularly beneficial in handling highly volatile assets and it gives its users more flexibility, control and risk management that suits their needs. Combining two effective solutions, Mutuum Finance offers an incomparable balance of efficiency, decentralization, and flexibility and will become a leader of the DeFi market in the future. Presale Phase 5 Accelerates Mutuum Finance presale is currently at Phase 5 and the momentum is gaining pace rapidly. Having over 12,300 investors who have joined already, and with almost 11 million already raised, the project is demonstrating that it is not just another DeFi experiment. Smart investors can’t miss a chance to purchase Mutuum Finance tokens with a price of just $0.03, which are set to increase and be $0.06 at launch, leading to a 2x yield on investments in the early phase. Mutuum Finance is designing an Ethereum-based fully collateralized USD stablecoin to complement its ecosystem even more. The asset is stable in volatile markets unlike algorithmic stablecoins that are vulnerable to depegging in volatile markets environments; therefore, making it a stable medium of exchange and store value institutionally and retail-wise. Ethereum’s march toward $4,000 has traders buzzing, but behind the scenes, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly setting the stage for even greater gains. With over 12,300 investors and $11 million raised so far in Phase 5, the token is priced at just $0.03, yet offers a 2x return by launch. Mutuum’s dual lending system, stablecoin integration, and real DeFi utility make it more than a presale hype. As ETH prepares for its next leg up, MUTM may be the real wealth builder for early backers looking to multiply their returns before 2026.
