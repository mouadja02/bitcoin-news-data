2025-06-23T11:56:07,"Why is XRP Price Dropping?","The post Why is XRP Price Dropping? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The XRP price has dropped below $ 2 for the first time in over 12 weeks. In the last 24 hours alone, XRP slipped by 2% to $1.99 , sparking concerns among investors and XRP enthusiasts. This 2.18% decline yesterday adds to a 7.93% drop since June 19, when XRP was priced at $2.17. At one point, XRP even touched $1.90, raising fears of a deeper correction. But experts suggest the problem isn’t with XRP itself. Why Did XRP Drop This Week? Analysts believe the XRP price fall isn’t about weak fundamentals but rather a result of broader market-wide pressure. According to Versan Aljarrah, co-founder of Black Swan Capitalist, the recent drop reflects overall market volatility, not a failure in XRP’s utility or use case. “XRP is simply following broader market sentiment,” he explained. Geopolitical Tensions Rock the Crypto Market The global crypto market is currently bearish. Over the last 24 hours, it has dropped by 2.6% , affecting nearly all major assets. Here’s a quick snapshot of this week’s top losers: Bitcoin: -4.9% Ethereum: -14% XRP: -8.3% Solana: -14.7% Dogecoin: -14% Cardano: -15.7% Sui & BCH: -20.3% each The Israel-Iran conflict is believed to be the main trigger. The Israel-Iran Conflict and Its Ripple Effects On June 22, the U.S. bombed three key Iranian nuclear sites, marking the most aggressive Western military action against Iran since 1979. In retaliation, Iran launched missiles at Israel and threatened U.S. bases in the Middle East. Iran’s parliament has also voted to shut down the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil passage. Oil Prices Surge – Crypto Takes a Hit The conflict has sent oil prices soaring: Brent Crude: +3% WTI Futures: 5-month high If oil prices climb to $100–$150 per barrel, as some analysts warn, it could lead to global inflation, lower liquidity, and a crypto sell-off. Rising energy costs also hurt Bitcoin mining profitability, adding further pressure to the market. Can XRP Bounce Back? Analysts Say Yes Despite the short-term drop, some analysts remain bullish on XRP. Expert EGRAG Crypto predicts XRP could hit: $6.70 $13 Even $27 if historic trends repeat Over the past year, XRP has gained 310.4%, outperforming even Bitcoin and Ethereum. Supporters argue its real value lies in its utility , not market noise. Final Thoughts XRP’s fall below $2 may feel alarming, but market analysts urge caution. The decline appears to be part of a broader correction in the crypto market, driven by geopolitical and macroeconomic shocks. As always, short-term volatility doesn’t erase long-term potential—especially for utility-driven assets like XRP.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/2025-06-23-why-is-xrp-price-dropping/,"BTC|COMMODITY|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","News|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

2025-06-23T11:45:03,"Trader Issues Warning to Bitcoin Top-Callers, Says BTC Still in Stage One Uptrend – Here’s What He Means","A closely followed crypto analyst believes that it’s very unlikely that Bitcoin ( BTC ) has already printed a bull market top at $110,000. In a new video update, crypto strategist Cheds tells his 49,800 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin’s long-term uptrend remains strong as the price of BTC trades above multiple moving averages on the weekly chart. According to the analyst, Bitcoin is just taking a breather after climbing from its 2025 low of around $74,000. “I think it’s hard to call a top here… How can you call a top? Look at this weekly chart. It’s by definition a stage one uptrend in a sense that it’s price above a rising EMA (exponential moving average) 8, and with this incredible price distance to a rising MA (moving average) 200, and a pretty good slope to the rising 200 as well. So there’s plenty of strength. There’s no way to call the top yet. We certainly know we’re consolidating.” Source: Cheds/YouTube In 2021, Bitcoin cratered after failing to take out the $69,000 level twice. The loss in bullish momentum triggered a bear market that sent BTC down to $16,000. For now, Cheds outlines levels to watch as Bitcoin consolidates. “$88,500 for me is the last level that needs to hold should $96,000 get tested and fail. And it’s a zone, not a number… Any kind of top now is not based on available information.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $101,957.

2025-06-23T11:45:00,"Unicoin to Buy Majority Stake in Diamond Lake, Will Launch Altcoin Treasury Strategy","Crypto firm Unicoin has agreed to buy a 51% stake in Diamond Lake Minerals, a firm specializing in digital assets, setting the stage for a strategic rebrand and a shift into altcoin treasury. The deal, which was announced on Monday, will see Diamond Lake Minerals renamed to DiamondLake and refocussed on building a cryptocurrency treasury business. That effort is inspired by Strategy’s bitcoin BTC-heavy corporate treasury strategy but swaps BTC for emerging altcoins. Shares of Diamond Lake Minerals’ were last trading at $3.96, suggesting the deal could be worth above $70 million. The acquisition is expected to close within 20 days, pending standard conditions. Unicoin CEO Alex Konanykhin framed the move as a bet on the future of cryptocurrencies. He cited legislative shifts like the recent passage of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act through the country’s Senate as catalysts that could unlock altcoin potential. ""We believe the same results achieved with Bitcoin can be replicated at a fraction of the cost in the alt-coin segment,” Konanykhin said. DiamondLake’s CEO Brian J. Esposito called the deal “historic,” emphasizing the company’s long-standing ambition to bring tokenization into the core of public market investment strategies. The new company will focus on tokenizing real-world assets and making them accessible to everyday investors. The acquisition comes roughly a month after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Unicorn and three of its executives, including Konanykhin, for allegedly raising over $100 million in a “massive securities fraud.” The agency claims Unicoin misled investors by inflating real estate valuations and promoting outsized, unrealistic returns, such as a 9 million percent gain, through aggressive marketing campaigns. The SEC is seeking disgorgement and civil penalties. Konanykhin has dismissed the charges as “blatantly false,” and suggested the SEC is still going after crypto firms, even after the regulator dropped cases against firms including Coinbase, Kraken, and Uniswap. He rejected a proposed settlement meeting in April, calling the SEC’s terms “unacceptable.” In a letter to shareholders, he argued that Unicoin had complied with U.S. regulations and accused the regulator of inflicting “multi-billion-dollar damages” through its probe.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/06/23/unicoin-to-buy-majority-stake-in-diamond-lake-will-launch-altcoin-treasury-strategy,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION","Finance|Unicoin|acquisition|Exclusive|News",cryptocompare

Moreover, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has decreased by 2.8% over the past day, now standing at $3.23 trillion, compared to Friday’s $3.37 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $161 billion, back to the typical levels. TL;DR: The crypto market has seen a notable drop over the weekend; BTC and ETH dropped around 1% over the past day each; At one point, BTC fell below the psychologically relevant $100,000 level; The probability of BTC ending 2025 above $200,000 has dropped to 3.5%; This is not over yet, analysts say, as market braces for instability; The market may experience additional hits. Crypto Winners & Losers All the top 10 coins per market cap are down today. Bitcoin (BTC) fell by 0.7%, now trading at $101,924, nearing the psychologically relevant $100,000 mark. This is also the smallest decrease in this category. Also, Ethereum (ETH) fell by 1%, changing hands at $2,251. This is the category’s second-smallest drop. XRP (XRP) saw the highest decrease in this category of 2.6% to the price of $2.02. Moreover, ten of the top 100 coins saw their prices increase in the same period. The best performer is Story (IP) , with the only double-digit increase of 11.6% to $3.06. At the same time, Filecoin (FIL) fell the most, followed by Toncoin (TON) . They’re down 3.9% and 3.8% to $2.12 and $2.75, respectively. Speaking of XRP, Bloomberg analysts recently placed the odds of an XRP spot ETF approval at 95% . The timing of these approvals/launches is more uncertain. Could be something we're talking about in the next month or two. Or it could be something that waits until October or later. Matter of when not if For Bloomberg clients, the note can be read here: https://t.co/PBdquFWPVn — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 20, 2025 Meanwhile, recent geopolitical shocks triggered immediate market reactions .

Trump's announcement of direct US involvement in the Middle East marked the local bottom. pic.twitter.com/02Uxuqe21d — Joe Consorti (@JoeConsorti) June 22, 2025 This Isn’t Over: Market Braces for Instability Dr. Sean Dawson, Head of Research at decentralized onchain options AI-powered platform, Derive.xyz , commented that the surge in short-term implied volatility (IV) confirms the market is bracing for more instability. Volatility markets are telling us this isn’t over. “Amid mounting geopolitical pressure, we’re seeing classic risk-off behavior with falling prices, spiking volatility, and a pullback in upside positioning,” Dawson says. At one point, BTC has pulled back from $104,300 to $100,300. At the same time, there was also spike in short-term implied volatility by 10% to 45%. This happened as traders began pricing in fresh risk. Moreover, ETH plunged nearly 14% from $2,550 to $2,200, along with a 15-point jump in 7-day IV to 83%. This reflects increased downside hedging and uncertainty, Dawson says. “Ethereum’s double-digit loss and volatility spike to 83% show just how fast risk can unravel when leverage is high,” he adds. Source: Derive.xyz, Amberdata Without a clear de-escalation trigger, the company expects more cautious positioning and subdued momentum in the month ahead, the Head of Research notes. Dawson notes that the BTC options market is currently “scaling back on optimism.” The probability of BTC ending 2025 above $200,000 has dropped to 3.5%. The chance of it surpassing $150,000 in that same period fell to 11%. “Bulls are losing conviction as geopolitical risk and macro headwinds overshadow halving optimism and ETF flows.” At the same time, the likelihood of BTC closing below $80,000 remains unchanged at 20%. All these percentages “show the options market leaning defensive. Traders aren’t betting big on upside right now.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $101,924. At one point over the past day, the coin saw a sharp drop from the intraday high $102,739 and below the psychologically critical $100,000 mark to $98,467. It has recovered somewhat since. Over the past 7 days, we have seen a decrease of 4.5% from the intraweek high of $108,771. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView At the same time, Ethereum is currently trading at $2,251. The price saw a daily high of $2,280, falling to $2,134, before rising slightly to the current price. Over the past week, ETH fell 13.7% from the weekly high of $2,671. Moreover, the crypto market sentiment has entered fear territory. The Fear and Greed Index has dropped from 48 on Friday and 40 on Sunday to the current 37 . Now, fear is driving the prices potentially pushing them lower. But it can also present a chance to buy the dip.

While BlackRock saw an inflow of $46.91 million, Fidelity recorded an outflow of $40.55 million.

The crypto market has seen a significant drop in a day, while the stock markets saw a mixed picture on their last day of trading. The S&P 500 went down by 0.22%, the Nasdaq-100 decreased by 0.43%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.083%. Investors were on edge over the Israel-Iran war and the US’s potential role. They were then surprised by the US attacks on Iran on Saturday, and this is bound to reflect on the stock market. Is this dip sustainable? Given the current geopolitical and economic developments, the prices may decrease further. Bitcoin may fall below $100,000 and ETH below $2,100.

2025-06-23T11:43:35,"SPX6900 Price Prediction: Traders Jump Ship as SPX Price Drops 37% in a Week, What’s Next?","The SPX6900 price has jumped by 8% today, with the altcoin’s move to $1.08 coming as the crypto market as a whole falls by 3% in the past 24 hours. Despite this increase, SPX6900 has fallen by 37% in the past week, as the wider market takes a big hit from the conflict in the Middle East . On the other hand, SPX remains up by 25% in a month and by a huge 9,900% in the past year, with the meme token only having set its current ATH of $1.73 some 12 days ago. It therefore continues to be one of the hot top-100 coins of the moment, with the coming weeks likely to bring further price increases as more investors plow into the token. SPX6900 Price Prediction: Traders Jump Ship as SPX Price Drops 37% in a Week, What’s Next? SPX’s chart looks very different from that of most other coins in the top 100, in that it has enjoyed a peak in the past couple of weeks, and not only in January, when Donald Trump took office. However, the flipside of this is that the coin entered a strongly overbought position, with its 37% drop in the past week providing a much-needed correction. Source: TradingView Indeed, SPX6900’s relative strength index (purple) has dropped to 40 this morning, which could be a prelude to a rebound. On the other hand, its MACD (orange, blue) has yet to return to its baseline or to become oversold, so it may be a few days before the token begins rallying again. But in the medium-term, SPX continues to look very promising, with its volumes still near their highest-ever levels, at around $100 million today. The meme token has been able to rise to new highs this month as a result of an influx of new investment, with major asset manager BlackRock being the most notable new investor in SPX . Open interest in the coin is also higher than it has been in every month prior to June , while its funding rate remains at a healthy 5.5%, indicating strong demand. This Cup & Handle pattern could make #SPX6900 go absolutely parabolic soon! pic.twitter.com/ghbhutWhXq — Coinvo (@ByCoinvo) June 21, 2025 And analysts are continuing to predict big things for the SPX6900 price in the coming weeks and months, with some highlighting a classic cup-and-handle pattern as a signal of an incoming breakout. Its fortunes in the next few days and weeks will depend on what happens in Iran, with a further escalation – such as the blocking of the Strait of Hormuz – likely to depress demand in the near term. However, if conditions settle, SPX could easily reach $1.25 by the end of July and $1.50 by the end of August. Bitcoin Bull Raises $7.3 Million in Snowballing Presale: Is Deflationary Meme Coin Ready to Explode? As good as SPX looks at the moment, it won’t be the only new token to do well this summer, particularly if market conditions (e.g. tariffs, Middle East) improve. There are also other, newer coins ready to surge in the coming weeks, including several presale tokens that have been building strong momentum recently. One of these is Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL), a deflationary ERC-20 token that has now raised $7.3 million in its ongoing ICO. Last chance to buy BTCBULL before launch! The countdown ends on June 30th. Here’s what’s coming: BTCBULL token burns BTC airdrops at price milestones BTCBULL airdrop when Bitcoin hits $250K Join the herd: https://t.co/FQZXEzFwWu pic.twitter.com/aeUmLJcSOC — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) June 2, 2025 What’s exciting about Bitcoin Bull is that its deflationary tokenomics are connected to Bitcoin’s (BTC) performance. With a hard cap of 21 billion BTCBULL, the token will conduct burns whenever BTC reaches price milestones for the first time. This will begin with $125,000, and repeat with each additional $25,000 added for the first time, shrinking BTCBULL’s supply in the long run. Not only that, but Bitcoin Bull will host airdrops of Bitcoin itself, with these happening whenever BTC adds $50,000 to its price for the time (starting with $150,000). This could make BTCBULL hugely profitable to hold, particularly when owners can stake it for a passive income. However, the coin’s presale will end in just under seven days, so investors will have to move quickly if they want to buy the token before it lists. They can do so by going to the Bitcoin Bull website , where BTCBULL is selling at its final presale price of $0.00258.

2025-06-23T11:42:43,"Ethereum Price Prediction As ETH Continues to Fall Behind Bitcoin in June 2025","Ethereum (ETH) has gone down by 14.5% in the past week as rising tensions in the Middle East have sparked a strong sell-off that has now pushed the token to the low 2,000s. The United States bombed nuclear enrichment facilities in Iran during the weekend and a new chapter in this armed conflict between Israel and Iran began as a result. The market was spooked by the news and a downward move that started on Wednesday accelerated during the weekend, pushing ETH from nearly $2,900 to its current level of $2,260. Bitcoin (BTC) has been increasing its dominance in the crypto market as investors have rotated their capital out of altcoins amid the uncertainty and volatility triggered by these events. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that BTC’s dominance has been steadily increasing in the past year, moving from 54.1% in June 2024 to 64% as of today. As a result, ETH’s dominance has stepped back from 18.2% to 8%. It appears that investors continue to see Bitcoin as the safer bet of all in the crypto market, which favors a bearish Ethereum price prediction. Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Could Drop to $1,800 if It Fails to Recapture These Levels Looking at the 4-hour chart, we can see that ETH has broken below two key supports already, the first at $2,380 and the second at $2,320. The token has now stepped out of consolidation as a result of this bearish breakout and could be heading to retest the $1,800 shortly as the uptrend has now been reversed. Momentum indicators have improved slightly as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has stepped out of oversold territory for the time being and has moved above the 14-period moving average. It is still too early to say that this is the end of the downtrend. What this improvement could mean in the near term is that ETH will retest these support levels from below and could then resume its downward momentum after it raises enough buy-side liquidity. As Bitcoin’s dominance continues to increase, all crypto presales associated with the top crypto stand to reap the benefits of its positive performance. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) has emerged as one of the most promising new presales as the project is raising the necessary capital to launch a layer-2 scaling solution for the Bitcoin network that unlocks the untapped potential of its DeFi ecosystem and more. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) Keeps Surpasses $1.5M Raised to Launch its L2 Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) leverages the efficiency of the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to unlock the potential of the Bitcoin network to become the home of the market’s most successful decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. The project creates a scalable Solana-based side chain that bundles transactions offline before sending them to the Bitcoin mainnet and provides near-instant finality. As a result, developers will be able to create efficient dApps for DeFi services like lending and borrowing and yield farming, create low-cost payment platforms that use BTC as their main token, and interfaces through which users can mint meme coins on the Bitcoin blockchain. The demand for $HYPER will explode once the solution is embraced by top wallets and exchanges. Hence, at its discounted presale price of $0.012, this token offers significant upside potential to early buyers.

2025-06-23T11:40:25,"Ether's Leverage-Driven Rally Faces Breakdown Risk, Matrixport Warns","Ether’s ETH recent rally may be on shaky ground with one firm warning that last week’s price surge was largely fueled by speculative futures positions instead of a bump in organic demand. In a note on Monday, Matrixport opined that “leveraged traders have pushed [ETH’s] price higher in the absence of fundamental support,” adding that this made the asset more susceptible to the “outsized decline” the asset saw over the weekend. Ether slumped over 8% in a Saturday sell-off, leading losses among majors as traders reacted to the U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear sites in a surprise airstrike. The firm pointed to last week’s sharp drop in ETH as evidence of this position-driven fragility and warned that elevated leverage levels could continue to pressure prices. At press time, ETH traded near $2,248 — down from last week’s high above $2,400 — as derivatives data showed traders aggressively hedging downside risk. Options market signals echo that caution, as CoinDesk analyst Omkar Godbole noted over the weekend . According to data from Amberdata, ETH’s 25-delta risk reversals — a measure comparing the cost of puts versus calls — have skewed negative across June to July expiries. This suggests investors are paying up for protection against downside volatility. QCP Capital further noted in a weekend market update that “risk reversals in both BTC and ETH continue to show a preference for downside protection,” adding that long holders are actively hedging their spot exposure.

2025-06-23T11:40:15,"Abraxas Capital Reveals Astounding $79.92M Unrealized Profit from Crypto Shorts","BitcoinWorld Abraxas Capital Reveals Astounding $79.92M Unrealized Profit from Crypto Shorts In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency trading, uncovering the strategies of major players can provide valuable insights. Recent on-chain data analysis has shed light on the significant activities of investment manager Abraxas Capital , revealing a substantial position in the market that has resulted in considerable gains. This firm appears to be capitalizing on bearish sentiment through carefully constructed trades. What Are Crypto Short Positions and Why Do They Matter? Before diving into the specifics of Abraxas Capital’s holdings, let’s clarify what a short position is in the context of cryptocurrency. Essentially, short selling is a trading strategy where an investor borrows an asset (like BTC or ETH) and sells it on the open market, with the intention of buying it back later at a lower price. The difference between the selling price and the repurchase price is the profit, minus any fees. Why would a firm take crypto short positions ? Typically, this strategy is employed when an investor believes the price of an asset is likely to fall. It’s a way to profit from a declining market. Unlike simply holding assets (going long), shorting involves borrowing, which introduces complexities and risks, especially when leverage is involved. Abraxas Capital ‘s Strategy Revealed by On-Chain Data According to insights from on-chain analyst The Data Nerd, shared on the social media platform X, two specific addresses have been identified as belonging to Abraxas Capital . These addresses are currently holding leveraged short positions across several prominent and emerging cryptocurrencies. The use of on-chain data allows observers to peer into the transactions and holdings of large market participants, offering transparency that isn’t always available in traditional finance. The analysis points to leverage ranging between 5x and 10x on these positions. Leverage magnifies both potential profits and potential losses. A 5x leverage means that for every 1% drop in the asset’s price, the short position gains 5% (before fees). Conversely, a 1% rise could lead to a 5% loss on the initial margin. This high degree of leverage indicates a strong conviction in the downward price movement of the targeted assets. Breaking Down the Assets: Bitcoin Short , Ethereum Short , and Others Abraxas Capital’s portfolio of short positions isn’t limited to just one or two assets. The firm has diversified its bearish bets across several cryptocurrencies, including: Bitcoin (BTC): As the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, a Bitcoin short position is a direct bet against the broader market sentiment. Ethereum (ETH): The second-largest crypto, an Ethereum short targets the extensive DeFi and NFT ecosystems built on its blockchain. Solana (SOL): A high-throughput blockchain often seen as a competitor to Ethereum. SUI (SUI): A relatively newer Layer 1 blockchain project. HYPE (HYPE): (Note: The specific asset ‘HYPE’ might refer to a less common or meme-coin asset. On-chain data accuracy relies on correct identification). This mix of established giants like BTC and ETH, alongside newer chains like SOL and SUI, suggests a strategy that isn’t solely focused on the top market cap assets but also includes bets on potential downturns in newer ecosystems. Understanding Unrealized Crypto Profit : What Does $79.92M Mean? The headline figure is the approximately $79.92 million in total unrealized crypto profit . What does ‘unrealized’ mean in this context? It signifies the profit that exists on paper based on the current market price of the assets since the short positions were opened. However, this profit has not yet been locked in because the positions are still open. The firm has not yet bought back the borrowed assets to close the shorts. This $79.92 million represents the potential gain if Abraxas Capital were to close all these leveraged short positions at the current market prices. It’s a substantial figure, highlighting the scale of their trading activity and the extent of the price drops in these assets since they initiated their shorts. However, it’s crucial to remember that this profit can fluctuate with market movements until the positions are closed. The Mechanics of Leverage: Amplifying Gains and Risks The 5x-10x leverage applied to these positions significantly amplifies the potential outcome. Leverage allows traders to control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital (margin). If the market moves favorably (prices drop for short positions), the returns on the initial margin can be very high. However, if the market moves unfavorably (prices rise), the losses are also magnified, and the position can face liquidation if the losses exceed the margin collateral. For example, a 10x leveraged short on BTC means that a 10% increase in BTC price could wipe out the entire margin used for that position, leading to liquidation. Managing leverage is a critical aspect of risk management in trading, especially with volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Why This Matters: Implications for the Market The revelation of a major investment firm like Abraxas Capital holding such large, profitable crypto short positions offers several insights: Institutional Sentiment: It suggests that at least some institutional players foresaw or are betting on continued downward price action in these specific assets or the broader market. Market Impact: While not necessarily the sole driver, large short positions can contribute to selling pressure if they are actively managed or scaled. On-Chain Data Value: This case underscores the power of on-chain analysis in providing transparency into the activities of large market participants, offering valuable data points for other traders and analysts. Challenges and Risks of Shorting Despite the reported unrealized crypto profit , holding leveraged short positions is not without significant risks: Liquidation Risk: As mentioned, adverse price movements can lead to rapid liquidation of the position, resulting in substantial losses. Unlimited Loss Potential: Theoretically, if an asset’s price keeps rising, the potential loss on a short position is unlimited (though leverage mechanisms on exchanges often include liquidation to prevent this). Funding Costs: Holding short positions on leveraged platforms often incurs periodic funding fees. Market Volatility: Crypto markets are known for sudden, sharp price swings that can quickly turn a profitable position into a losing one. Actionable Insights from On-Chain Analysis The ability to track the positions of entities like Abraxas Capital through on-chain data provides a powerful tool. While not financial advice, observing where large players are placing their bets (long or short) can inform individual trading strategies or provide a pulse on institutional sentiment. It highlights the growing sophistication of market analysis using publicly available blockchain data. Summary: A Glimpse into Institutional Bearish Bets The reported $79.92 million in unrealized crypto profit from Abraxas Capital ‘s leveraged crypto short positions across assets like BTC, ETH, SOL, SUI, and HYPE offers a fascinating look into how institutional investors are navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. While this figure represents potential profit that is subject to market fluctuations until realized, it underscores the scale of their bearish bets and the power of leverage. This case also serves as a prime example of how on-chain data analysis is becoming an indispensable tool for understanding market dynamics and the strategies of major participants, including those taking significant Bitcoin short and Ethereum short positions.

2025-06-23T11:37:32,"Bitcoin Market Faces Sharp Deleveraging as Investors Exit Risk Positions","After plunging to $98,000, Bitcoin’s price has staged a recovery, climbing back to levels above $100,000. There has also been a dramatic drop in the Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR), which highlighted a significant investor exit from risk amid increased geopolitical tensions. In fact, the ELR plunged to -0.25 within just three days, levels not seen since the aftermath of China’s 2021 crypto mining ban, when it hit -0.35, but over a longer period of one month. Traders Flee Risk Amid Uncertainty According to CryptoQuant’s analysis , this sharp and rapid decline signals a wave of deleveraging, where both forced liquidations and voluntary position closures have reduced Open Interest across derivatives markets. The immediate catalyst appears to be the escalating conflict between the US and Iran, which has injected a fresh wave of uncertainty into already fragile markets. Such a swift ELR contraction means that market participants are aggressively pulling back from risk, as they anticipate further volatility. While this trend reflects short-term caution, CryptoQuant suggests that panic-driven selloffs may also create strategic opportunities for longer-term investors. Despite this, the current environment is one of rising unpredictability, and leveraged trades now come with amplified risk. This phase matches historical stress points and is indicative of a market recalibration that could either stabilize with time or descend further depending on macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. Bitcoin’s Bull Cycle May Still Be Intact Even as the market struggles amidst volatility, on-chain data shows that long-term holders remain resilient, choosing to hold rather than sell. One key indicator, the Binary CDD 30-day moving average, has stayed below the critical 0.8 threshold and peaked instead at around 0.6 before beginning to decline. This behavior essentially means that long-term investors are not actively moving or spending older coins. The absence of high CDD activity implies that seasoned holders still expect further upside. While some cooling is evident, especially after a period of aggressive price action, the lack of major distribution from long-term wallets hints that the bull cycle remains intact. As in past cycles, Bitcoin often climbs higher in a “staircase” pattern – pausing, consolidating, then rallying further. The muted on-chain activity and subdued sentiment could, counterintuitively, set the stage for the next leg up, as history shows Bitcoin tends to rally hardest when few are paying attention.

With the increasing number of Germans investing in crypto assets, it has become crucial for the government to create a regulatory framework to maintain stability and protect investors. As of 2025, Germany is implementing MiCA rules while tightening AML/CFT compliance. Table of contents Crypto Regulations in Germany What is the German Government Saying About Cryptocurrency? Crypto Tax in Germany Crypto License in Germany Crypto Adoption in Germany Conclusion FAQs Crypto Regulations in Germany March 6, 2025: The Federal Ministry of Finance (BMF) publishes an updated circular on the income tax treatment of crypto assets. Key changes: The term “virtual currencies and other tokens” is replaced with “crypto assets.” Differentiation between active and passive staking for tax purposes. Tax implications for decentralized finance (DeFi) are addressed for the first time. New requirements for transaction overviews and tax reporting. Clearer guidelines for valuing crypto assets, including the use of daily market rates. Emphasis on documentation and retention obligations for taxpayers. Transitional rules apply for tax years up to and including 2024 to help taxpayers adapt to the new provisions. February 18, 2025: Legal analysis highlights the impact of the new Act on the Digitalisation of the Financial Market (Finanzmarktdigitalisierungsgesetz, FinmadiG) and the Act on the Supervision of Markets for Crypto-Assets (Kryptomärkte-Aufsichtsgesetz, KMAG). These acts introduce transitional provisions for crypto service providers and allow for a smooth application of MiCAR (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) in Germany. Existing licenses remain valid until December 31, 2025, under a grandfathering regime, giving providers time to transition to MiCAR-compliant licenses Date Regulation/ Law Details June 30, 2024 MiCA regulation Provisions for ARTs and EMTs became applicable May to November 2024 Crypto tax update Short-term and long-term tax, mining, staking, and income tax April 20, 2023 EU parliament adopted MiCA (EU-2023/1114) EU-wide regulations for crypto assets December 16, 2020 Electronic Securities Act (eWpG) Legalized all electronic securities (came into effect in June 2021) January 1, 2020 Exchange and custodian licensing BaFin icesenes required for crypto operations November 2019 Crypto custody law for banks Banks can sell and store crypto as regulated by BaFin November 29, 2019 Implementation of Directive (EU) 2018/843 5th EU Anti-Money Laundering Directive was adopted What is the German Government Saying About Cryptocurrency? The Free Democratic Party of Germany explicitly called for the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in the country. However, it is not regulated yet. Besides the federal government, the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) regulates crypto. BaFin regulates: Licensing and enforcement of AML and CFT rules Blockchain-based lending through the German Banking Act Prohibits any illicit activity in the crypto space Crypto Tax in Germany Capital gains tax: Since cryptocurrencies are not acknowledged as stocks, but rather ‘private economic goods,’ therefore, CGT does not apply . Income tax: The income tax on cryptocurrency ranges from 0% to 45%, depending on the total income. Tax-free event: Gains from crypto trading are exempted from tax up to 1000€ per year. Income from staking and mining is free up to an exemption limit of 256€ per year. Tax reporting: The Last date for the 2024 tax return is July 31, 2025; if the tax return is prepared by tax advisors, the deadline extends to April 30, 2026. Crypto Income in 2025 Tax rate Up to 12.084€ 0% Up to 17.430€ 14-24% Up to 68.430€ 24-42% Up to 277.825€ 42% Over 277.826€ 45% Crypto License in Germany Custody hold: Custody hold requires obtaining a license from BaFin for managing third-party rights and services . CASP license: Crypto assets service providers also require a BaFin-authorized license to operate in Germany. Operating crypto-to-crypto, fiat-to-crypto exchanges, custodial wallet services, and other activities requires licensing. How to get a license? Crypso businesses are required to register with BaFin, establish a local presence in Germany, hold minimum capital (€125,000 to €350,000), and comply with AML and KYC regulations . At least one member of the business must be a resident of the EU. Crypto Adoption in Germany Adoption rate: By 2025, around 27.32 million Germans will use cryptocurrency, representing 32.84% of the population. This indicates an increase in the adoption from previous years. Crypto revenue: The revenue in the crypto market in Germany is projected to reach US$2.5 billion in 2025. An annual growth rate of 16.33% is expected, resulting in US$2.9 billion by 2026. Crypto holdings: The German government sold its entire crypto holdings in mid-2024 (46,359 BTC, approx $3.9 billion), and as of 2025, it does not hold any cryptocurrency. Conclusion Crypto trading and holding are legal in Germany, as the government has provided a set of rules to operate any crypto-related activity. Germany’s main focus for implementing a structured approach is to ensure investors’ protection and financial stability. With its light crypto tax, Germany is considered one of the most crypto-friendly countries in the European Union. If Germany maintains this stability in the crypto space, it can position itself as the crypto leader in the EU in no time. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-23T11:32:34,"Metaplanet Buys 1,111 BTC, Total Holdings Now Top $1.1 Billion","Metaplanet Inc. has announced a 1,111 BTC purchase, pushing its total holdings to 11,111 BTC valued at over $1.12 billion. This latest acquisition, executed at an average price of approximately $106,408 per Bitcoin, further solidified the Tokyo-based investment firm’s position among the world’s top ten largest corporate holders of the original cryptocurrency, increasing its lead over Coinbase in 10th place and trailing Hut 8 in 8th by 273 BTC. Metaplanet Sets Its Sights Higher Chairman Simon Gerovich confirmed the buy via a post on X, where he revealed that the company was targeting 30,000 BTC before the end of 2025. Additionally, in an infographic shared in a follow-up post , Gerovich outlined his firm’s path to hitting 210,000 BTC by 2027. He projects the company acquiring 70,000 BTC in 2026 to get to 100,000, and adding another 110,000 the following year to own exactly 1% of the entire Bitcoin supply. Metaplanet’s rapid rise, from 97.850 BTC in April 2024, has been driven by relentless capital market activity. The organization has utilized a combination of stock acquisition rights and zero-coupon bond issuances, primarily directed to EVO FUND, to fuel its Bitcoin accumulation strategy. The 1,111 BTC, bought for $118.2 million, follows a similar pattern, coming weeks after a $117 million acquisition of 1,112 BTC on June 16, which increased its holding to 10,000 BTC. Before that, the firm purchased 1,088 BTC on June 2 for approximately $117.5 million. Its average buy-in across all 11,111 BTC now stands at $95,869. Metaplanet measures success through the “BTC Yield” metric, reflecting Bitcoin accretion per fully diluted share. In a statement shared on X, the firm revealed that the metric has soared 306.7% year-to-date, with a particularly strong 107.9% gain between April 1 and June 23, translating to a hypothetical gain of 4,367 BTC purely from operations, worth ¥66.189 billion at their reference price. Despite this aggressive strategy, the company’s stock was down 5.39% at the time of this writing, changing hands at ¥1,685, possibly due to heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East following the United States’ bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities. The dip was also witnessed in the price of Bitcoin. Currently trading at around $101,511, the asset is down 4.5% over the past week and 6.5% in the last month. BTC Treasuries Catching On Metaplanet’s buying spree is not just reshaping its own balance sheet; it signals a deepening institutional embrace of Bitcoin as a core treasury reserve asset. According to HODL15Capital, by June 16, 24 companies had increased their holding of the number one crypto asset by an additional 11,902 units. These include Singapore’s Genius Group, which bought 100 BTC and is targeting 1,000, and Sweden’s first Bitcoin treasury company, H100, which recently increased its ownership of the asset to 169 BTC.

2025-06-23T11:30:07,"Bitcoin Exchange Coinbase Expands to Europe! Authorized to Provide Service in 27 Countries! Here Are the Details","Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced that it has been granted a license from Luxembourg under the European Union’s new crypto asset regulation MiCA, authorizing it to provide services in all 27 EU member states. Coinbase Receives MiCA License from Luxembourg to Expand Presence in Europe The company announced on Friday that it has been licensed by the Luxembourg Commission for Financial Sector Supervision (CSSF) and has officially established its European headquarters in Luxembourg. “Over the last few years, we have worked closely with regulators across Europe, securing licences in Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain. “Now, with MiCA, we are bringing these efforts together under one roof, giving millions of Europeans access to regulated, reliable and secure crypto services,” the company said in a statement. What is MiCA? The Crypto-Asset Markets Regulation (MiCA) aims to simplify compliance processes and increase consumer protection by creating a single legal framework for crypto-asset service providers across the European Union. MiCA entered into force by the end of 2024 and is binding across the EU. Following Coinbase, other major crypto platforms are also drawing attention by making moves to strengthen their positions in Europe. According to Reuters, Gemini, owned by the Winklevoss brothers, is in the final stages of the process of obtaining a MiCA licence through Malta. The company had applied in January 2025. Similarly, another major exchange, OKX, has chosen Malta as its MiCA headquarters. This strategic move by Coinbase reflects both the fierce competition in the European market and the desire of crypto firms to position themselves more strongly in jurisdictions with regulatory clarity. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-23T11:30:00,"Everyone’s Talking Bitcoin, But These 3 Tokens Could 3x Before the Headlines Catch On","As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to sustain its price above $100,000, smart money is looking for new opportunities for growth. One of the groups being watched closely is the whales, who are looking for new growth in presales. While whales rarely make speeches online, their on-chain activity is easy to watch. It has become obvious that they are not just betting on Bitcoin (BTC). They are looking to ride the next altcoin run to the top. A major reason why whales are watched so closely is that they do not make buys blindly. They often have a great research system in place that allows them to find coins before they go parabolic. One token that has become a target of these whales is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . When whales act, it is time to follow. Besides Mutuum finance (MUTM), here are the coins you should be watching closely in June 2025. Stellar (XLM) Stellar (XLM) is a coin that aims to revolutionize cross-border payments. The blockchain for this project is built for fast, low-cost transactions between various currencies. As a result, it has gained some institutional acceptance. The project has especially found a huge following in countries with an underdeveloped financial system, where access to traditional finance is limited. Stellar (XLM) has recently entered into partnerships to expand its reach. The continued growth and adoption of crypto worldwide ensure that it is one of the top altcoins to watch in 2025. However, massive gains are not expected for XLM in the medium term. XRP XRP is a project whose parent company, Ripple Labs, has had to deal with massive legal battles. However, it has continued to retain a strong presence in the crypto market. Like XLM, Ripple Labs aims to make XRP the global coin for international payments. However, it is even more ambitious and aims to replace SWIFT. One of its biggest legal battles so far has been with the US SEC. While the battle shows signs of winding down, XRP has a long way to go before it can be accepted as an international payment system. The coin has proven its resilience, which could make it a good option for long-term growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) When it comes to utility-focused coins, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the latest entrant. It does not just aim to be the next DeFi coin; its goal is to dominate the space. Currently in its presale phase, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised over $10.95 million so far from around 12,350 investors. The presale is in phase 5, where tokens are going for $0.03. The current price represents a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6, the price will increase by another 16.67% to $0.035. These gradual increases are designed to ensure that the earliest supporters get the biggest benefits. One of the benefits of purchasing your tokens in the current phase is that you will get them at a massive 50% discount to the planned listing price of $0.06. Analysts are calling the MUTM tokens presale one of the most exciting of 2025. They forecast that the price could go up by 2,550% when the tokens go live. With such a high projection, there is no reason you should miss this presale. For instance, if you bought $1,300 worth of tokens at the current price, your investment could grow to $33,150. That is a massive return that seasoned investors are rushing to secure. You too have a chance to be part of this amazing opportunity in just a few simple steps. Simply connect your wallet, loaded with one of the accepted coins, and purchase as many MUTM tokens as you want. Massive Giveaway Another major benefit of purchasing MUTM tokens is the ongoing $100,000 giveaway . This giveaway has been a passive boost to presale participation. So far, 45% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 have been sold, barely two weeks after it started. At this rate, the opportunity for 20x returns will not last long. To participate in this massive giveaway, you only need to purchase a minimum of $50 worth of MUTM tokens. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team will then pick ten lucky winners who will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. You can be part of this lucky group that will make a 100% guaranteed ROI based on the planned listing price of $0.06, while also winning $10k. Summary While there are several promising opportunities in the crypto market, none of them come close to what Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has to offer. By joining the presale now, you stand to be part of an ecosystem designed for long-term value growth. With a planned beta version launch on token listing day, this project is headed to the moon. Do not let it pass you by while you have an opportunity to do something about it.

2025-06-23T11:20:52,"Bitcoin Dips Below $100K After US-Iran Tensions, Analysts Predict Rebound","Bitcoin briefly dropped below the $100,000 mark for the first time in over six weeks following geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and Iran, but market experts say the decline is temporary. The flagship cryptocurrency fell to $98,500 late Sunday after reports emerged of a U.S. airstrike targeting Iranian nuclear facilities. The dip was short-lived, however, as Bitcoin quickly rebounded to $101,500 at the time of writing. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes weighed in on the development via X, stating that the market weakness would not last. “This weakness shall pass,” Hayes said, adding that Bitcoin’s role as a “safe haven” asset will become increasingly evident as central banks resume aggressive money printing . Support Levels Hold Firm Amid Summer Consolidation Despite the volatility, Bitcoin remains within a key technical range. Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, said the digital asset continues to trade above its short-term realized price of $98,000 and its broader trend support level of $102,000. “As long as Bitcoin holds above these levels, traders can continue to look for tactical rally opportunities,” he noted. However, Thielen warned that if BTC slips below this critical support range, investor sentiment may shift toward risk management, particularly with no strong bullish catalysts currently on the horizon. He added that Bitcoin’s sideways movement over the past five weeks reflects broader macroeconomic instability, citing three failed attempts to surpass the $110,000 level. Each attempt was hampered by market turbulence, from May’s tariff concerns to the recent Israel–Iran escalation . “These events have shown that Bitcoin, for now, is not functioning as a traditional risk-off hedge,” Thielen explained. He expects the asset’s sideways trading pattern to persist over the coming months. “Our view is that we consolidate over the summer,” he concluded. Broader Crypto Market Faces Pressure Bitcoin’s brief drop also pulled down the broader crypto market. According to CoinGecko data, the total market capitalization fell by 1.5% in the last 12 hours, shedding nearly $50 billion and settling at $3.21 trillion. Most altcoins were trading in the red during this period, reflecting the market-wide uncertainty. Still, market watchers believe BTC’s long-term trajectory remains intact, especially if inflation pressures force central banks to ease monetary policy, reinforcing Bitcoin’s narrative as a digital store of value.

2025-06-23T11:20:00,"Bitcoin Season Confirmed: Altcoin Index Plummets to 14","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Season Confirmed: Altcoin Index Plummets to 14 Are you wondering what’s really happening in the crypto market right now? While individual altcoins might show bursts of activity, a key metric suggests the broader trend heavily favors the king coin. The Altcoin Season Index , a widely watched indicator, has registered a low reading of 14, pointing towards a period known as Bitcoin Season . Understanding the Altcoin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors seeking to understand the prevailing market dynamics. Tracked and provided by the reputable cryptocurrency price data platform CoinMarketCap (CMC), this index offers a snapshot of how the broader altcoin market is performing relative to Bitcoin. Here’s a breakdown of how the index works: Scope: It analyzes the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap. Exclusions: Stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like wBTC) are excluded from the calculation to focus purely on the performance of non-pegged assets and native altcoins. Timeframe: The index looks at the performance of these top 100 coins over the past 90 days. Comparison: It compares the percentage price change of each of these altcoins against the percentage price change of Bitcoin over the same 90-day period. The Thresholds: To be considered in Altcoin Season , at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. To be considered in Bitcoin Season , 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Readings between these thresholds (26% to 74%) suggest a more neutral or transitional market phase. The Scale: The index is presented as a score ranging from 1 to 100, where higher numbers indicate stronger altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin, and lower numbers indicate stronger Bitcoin performance relative to altcoins. This metric provides a simple yet effective way to gauge whether capital is broadly flowing into altcoins or consolidating within Bitcoin. Decoding the Current Index Reading: 14 As of June 23, 00:30 UTC, the Altcoin Season Index registered a reading of 14. Let’s put this number into perspective. Remember the thresholds we discussed? A reading of 14 falls well below the 25% mark required for Bitcoin Season . What does an index score of 14 explicitly tell us? It means that over the past 90 days, only a very small percentage – precisely 14% – of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have managed to outperform Bitcoin. This is a clear and strong signal that the prevailing market trend has been one where Bitcoin has been the dominant performer, with the vast majority of altcoins lagging behind. A score this low indicates that the market isn’t just leaning towards Bitcoin; it’s firmly entrenched in a phase where Bitcoin’s price action is leading, and many altcoins are either trading sideways, declining, or simply not keeping pace with BTC’s gains. This specific reading of 14 confirms the market is currently in Bitcoin Season . Understanding What Bitcoin Season Means for the Crypto Market When the Altcoin Season Index is low, indicating Bitcoin Season , it signifies a particular phase in the market cycle. This period is typically characterized by several factors: Bitcoin Dominance: Bitcoin’s market capitalization tends to grow relative to the total altcoin market cap. Investors may be prioritizing Bitcoin due to its perceived safety, liquidity, or as a primary driver of market momentum. Capital Inflow to BTC: New money entering the crypto market or existing capital within the market often flows into Bitcoin first during this phase. Altcoin Underperformance: Most altcoins struggle to gain significant traction against Bitcoin. Even if altcoins see price increases, Bitcoin’s percentage gains are typically larger. Some altcoins may even see their value decrease in BTC terms, even if their USD price is stable or slightly up. Reduced Risk Appetite: A strong Bitcoin Season can sometimes coincide with periods of market uncertainty or consolidation after a major rally, where investors become more risk-averse and move towards the largest, most established asset. Focus on Large Caps: Within the altcoin space, larger capitalization altcoins might perform relatively better than smaller cap or more speculative assets, though still often lagging behind Bitcoin. It’s crucial to understand that Bitcoin Season doesn’t necessarily mean altcoins are crashing across the board (though they can). It primarily means they are not keeping up with Bitcoin’s performance, and in many cases, losing value when measured against BTC. Navigating the Market During Bitcoin Season Given the current reading of the Altcoin Season Index at 14, confirming Bitcoin Season , how should investors approach the market? Here are some considerations and potential strategies: Prioritize Risk Management: Volatility can still be high. Ensure you have a solid risk management plan in place, including setting stop-losses if you are actively trading. Focus on Bitcoin (Potentially): If you believe Bitcoin’s dominance will continue, focusing a larger portion of your portfolio on BTC might align with the prevailing trend. Be Selective with Altcoins: During Bitcoin Season , picking altcoins that will outperform is much harder. Focus on projects with strong fundamentals, clear use cases, significant development activity, or upcoming catalysts that might allow them to decouple from the general altcoin trend. Accumulate Altcoins (Carefully): For long-term investors, Bitcoin Season can present opportunities to accumulate certain altcoins at lower prices relative to Bitcoin. However, this requires careful research and a belief in the long-term potential of the specific projects. Watch Bitcoin Dominance Chart: In addition to the Altcoin Season Index , monitoring the Bitcoin Dominance chart (BTC.D) on sites like CoinMarketCap can provide further insight into capital flows. A rising BTC.D confirms Bitcoin Season. Patience is Key: This phase can test the patience of altcoin holders. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term price movements. Remember, market conditions can change rapidly. While the index signals Bitcoin Season now, it’s a snapshot of the past 90 days. Future performance is not guaranteed. When Could We See a Shift Back to Altcoin Season? The crypto market is cyclical, and Bitcoin Season doesn’t last forever. Eventually, conditions typically align for a return to Altcoin Season . What signs might signal this shift? The most obvious is a sustained increase in the Altcoin Season Index itself, ideally moving towards and then above the 75 threshold. Other potential indicators include: Bitcoin Consolidation: Often, after a significant price run, Bitcoin enters a period of consolidation, trading sideways within a range. This allows altcoins to potentially catch up or even surpass Bitcoin’s performance. Emergence of Strong Altcoin Narratives: New trends or significant developments within specific sectors (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2s, AI tokens) can attract significant capital specifically into those altcoins. Increased Altcoin Trading Volume: A noticeable increase in trading volume for a wide range of altcoins, especially smaller and mid-cap ones, can indicate growing interest. Improved Market Sentiment: A general increase in optimism and risk appetite across the crypto market can fuel altcoin rallies. Decreasing Bitcoin Dominance: A sustained downtrend in the Bitcoin Dominance chart often precedes or coincides with Altcoin Season . Investors looking for the next Altcoin Season should monitor these factors in addition to the index. Conclusion: Navigating the Currents of Bitcoin Season The Altcoin Season Index provides a clear quantitative measure of the current market environment. Its reading of 14 unequivocally confirms that the crypto market is experiencing Bitcoin Season , meaning the vast majority of altcoins have lagged behind Bitcoin’s performance over the last three months. This phase requires investors to be particularly diligent, focusing on risk management, careful altcoin selection, and potentially favoring Bitcoin or larger-cap assets. While Bitcoin Season presents challenges for altcoin holders, it’s also a natural part of the market cycle. By understanding what the index signifies and watching for signs of a potential shift, investors can better navigate the current market conditions and prepare for the eventual return of Altcoin Season .

However, the marked low of $98K quickly reversed 3% on Monday, as several whales and institutions remain optimistic despite continued geopolitical impacts. The giants have seen the current falling prices of BTC as a nice investment opportunity. They seem to know that “buy the dip” is the best course of action amid the short-term war. Keep reading to know more. Institutions Are Buying the Dip In Bitcoin When writing, the BTC exchanged hands at $101569, barely up from the recent crash. This 3% rise happened as the long-term BTC advocate Michael Saylor revealed plans for additional Bitcoin purchases on June 22nd. He optimistically shared MSTR’s portfolio tracker chart and boldly remarked that nothing stops this orange from advancing. This update was shared when the BTC was on downward price action, and recently known analyst Captain Faibik found a weekly RSI divergence in play that could pull BTC towards $92K to $94K levels. $BTC #Bitcoin Weekly RSI Bearish Divergence in Play..!! 92-94k Incoming soon.. pic.twitter.com/QGx2B0plk5 — Captain Faibik (@CryptoFaibik) June 23, 2025 The saylor’s optimism points out that he is poised to buy this dip on BTC, and raising hopes for future momentum could be parabolic. Based on his plan, buying the dip could give him excessive returns when BTC flies higher. Inspired by Saylor’s decision, Metaplanet has bought another 1,111 BTC today worth $111 Million, and most recently, publicly traded Panther Metals also plans to buy 4 million pounds, equal to USD 5.35 million of BTC for its treasury. Similarly, publicly traded Sequans has announced that it wishes to raise $384 million to launch its Bitcoin treasury. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Key US Economic Events Could Trigger a Massive Crypto Market Sell-Off , Moreover, as its current price dynamics indicate further fall, just like Captain Faibik highlights, the mister crypto also shared that bears have been aggressive and massive amounts of liquidity sit on the top side,too.

2025-06-23T11:15:00,"Crypto Daybook Americas: Bitcoin Seen Overcoming Bearish Futures, Options Signals","By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Markets are accustomed to violence in the Middle East. That, at least, is the conclusion you might draw from the way financial markets — especially oil — reacted to the U.S. airstrikes on Iran's nuclear sites over the weekend and the threat of Iran blocking the key Strait of Hormuz shipping route. Both Brent and WTI crude gapped higher by just 3% early Monday and have since reversed gains alongside positive moves in bitcoin (BTC) and futures tied to the S&P 500. The dollar index is trading slightly higher and gold is nursing moderate losses. Long-term catalysts will overcome any bearish sentiment, said Valentine Fournier, an analyst at BRN. ""Despite short-term volatility and [short-lived] risk-off sentiment, long-term structural demand is growing stronger. Public entities like Texas and corporations like MetaPlanet are solidifying bitcoin’s position as a strategic reserve, laying the groundwork for a rebound once uncertainty fades,"" Fournier said in an email. ""We remain constructive on bitcoin’s resilience and believe Solana could outperform in a recovery. Ethereum has lost some institutional support short term, but may regain ground as volatility cools,"" Fournier added. Mean Theodorou, co-founder at crypto exchange Coinstash, said volatility could persist during the week ahead as macro conditions and political headlines remain in the drivers' seat, with all eyes fixated on the U.S.-Iran situation. Other observers pointed to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's semiannual monetary policy testimony to Congress, scheduled for Tuesday, and Friday's release of core PCE data as key events for the week. Theodorou said that altcoins may remain active as traders seek opportunities outside of major-cap tokens, although ""caution is warranted given recent price instability, with DOGE, ADA and SOL each posting steep double-digit losses, highlighting broad market de-risking as international conflict is set to dominate most decision making in the near-term."" In other news, Tokyo-listed Metaplanet said it bought another 1,111 BTC. The cryptocurrency exchange OKX is reportedly considering an initial public offering (IPO) in the U.S. Grant Cardone, CEO of real estate investment firm Cardone Capital, disclosed that the company has added approximately 1,000 BTC to its balance sheet. As for the developing influence of artificial intelligence, popular AI agent Aixbt said decentralized perpetuals-focused exchange Hyperliquid has proved DeFi can outperform during real stress, referring the risk-off over the weekend. ""Next crisis gonna separate the platforms that actually work from the ones propped up by VC money and empty promises,"" the agent said. Stay alert!

The Ink Foundation announced a 1 billion fixed-supply INK token and a community airdrop via an Aave liquidity pool. Despite rising activity, Ink's total value locked (TVL) remains under $8 million, signaling untapped growth potential. Ink started its mainnet in early December, beating its original Q1 2025 schedule. Fully EVM-compatible, Ink enables developers to migrate Ethereum apps for cheaper and faster execution. The network is part of Optimism’s Superchain, joining Base, Sony, Uniswap and others in a broader layer-2 (L2) ecosystem. The INK token will not be used for governance, but for incentivizing liquidity and app usage on the network. Derivatives Positioning Annualized BTC futures basis on offshore exchanges has dropped below 5%, nearly closing the gap with the 10-year U.S. Treasury note. Meanwhile, on the CME, basis remains steady around 7%. A similar dynamic is seen in the ether market. Funding rates for BTC and ETH were slightly positive, while TRX, BCH and XLM rates were deeply negative in a sign of bias for short positions. The price recovery from overnight lows looked shaky as the cumulative volume delta for most tokens, including BTC, was negative. A negative CVD indicates stronger selling pressure. On Deribit, near-dated puts traded at a premium to calls, reflecting downside fears, with bullishness emerging clearly only after September expiry.

2025-06-23T11:10:58,"Urgent: Economic Events This Week Could Fuel Massive Crypto Market Impact","BitcoinWorld Urgent: Economic Events This Week Could Fuel Massive Crypto Market Impact Hey crypto enthusiasts! Ever wonder why Bitcoin suddenly pumps or dumps when there’s no major crypto-specific news? Often, the answer lies in the broader macroeconomic landscape, particularly the signals coming from the United States. This week, from June 23rd to June 27th, is packed with crucial Economic Events that demand your attention. Understanding these dates and potential outcomes could give you an edge in navigating the often-volatile crypto waters. Why You Should Pay Attention to Fed Speakers This Week The Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank, plays a massive role in setting the tone for global financial markets, including cryptocurrencies. Their decisions on interest rates and monetary policy directly influence the availability of capital and investor appetite for risk assets like crypto. This week features a lineup of prominent Fed Speakers , offering direct insights into the central bank’s current thinking. Pay close attention to their language – is it ‘hawkish’ (leaning towards higher rates/tighter policy) or ‘dovish’ (leaning towards lower rates/looser policy)? Here’s a look at the Fed speakers scheduled for this week (All listed times are in UTC): Date Time (UTC) Speaker Notes Monday, June 23 07:00 Fed Waller 14:00 FOMC Member Bowman 17:10 Fed Goolsbee 18:30 FOMC Member Kugler 18:30 FOMC Member Williams Tuesday, June 24 14:00 Fed Chair Powell Testifies 16:30 FOMC Member Williams 18:05 Fed Collins 20:00 Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Barr Wednesday, June 25 14:00 Fed Chair Powell Testifies Thursday, June 26 12:00 FOMC Member Barkin 12:45 FOMC Member Barkin Friday, June 27 11:30 FOMC Member Williams 13:15 Fed Governor Cook The key event here is Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s testimony on Tuesday and Wednesday. His words carry significant weight and can cause immediate market reactions. Pay close attention to any commentary on inflation, employment, and future Interest Rate Policy . Decoding Key Data: GDP, Jobs, and Inflation Data Beyond the speeches, several hard data points are scheduled for release this week. These numbers provide a snapshot of the U.S. economy’s health and are critical inputs for the Fed’s policy decisions. Their impact on the Crypto Market Impact can be substantial. Here are the major data releases: Thursday, June 26, 12:30 UTC: U.S. GDP (QoQ) (Q1) – Gross Domestic Product measures the total value of goods and services produced. It’s a key indicator of economic growth. A stronger-than-expected GDP report might suggest the economy is robust, potentially giving the Fed more room to maintain or raise rates. A weaker report could signal a slowdown, possibly increasing the likelihood of rate cuts. Thursday, June 26, 12:30 UTC: U.S. Initial Jobless Claims – This report tracks the number of people filing for unemployment benefits for the first time. It’s a timely indicator of the labor market’s health. Rising jobless claims suggest a weakening job market, which could also pressure the Fed towards looser policy. Friday, June 27, 12:30 UTC: U.S. PCE Price Index (May) – This is the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the Fed’s preferred measure of Inflation Data . This report is arguably the most critical data point this week. High PCE inflation numbers reinforce the need for tight monetary policy, while falling inflation could open the door for rate cuts. Both outcomes can significantly move markets. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors How can you use this information? First, be aware that volatility could increase around the times of these announcements and speeches. Second, listen for clues about the Fed’s stance on inflation and interest rates. If the data and speeches lean hawkish (strong economy, persistent inflation, tough talk from the Fed), it might create headwinds for risk assets like crypto. Conversely, dovish signals (weak data, falling inflation, cautious Fed commentary) could be seen as positive for crypto as lower interest rates make speculative assets more attractive. Keep an eye on how traditional markets react, particularly the stock market (like the S&P 500) and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). Often, crypto will follow their lead, especially on major macro news. Summary: Navigating the Week Ahead This week is set to be eventful on the macroeconomic front, with a barrage of Fed speeches culminating in Chair Powell’s testimony, alongside crucial releases like GDP, Jobless Claims, and the highly anticipated PCE Inflation Data . These Economic Events provide vital clues about the future direction of Interest Rate Policy , which in turn has a profound Crypto Market Impact . Stay informed, monitor the releases closely, and be prepared for potential market movements as investors digest this influx of information from Fed Speakers and economic reports.

2025-06-23T11:09:25,"Crypto Price Analysis 6-23: BITCOIN: BTC, ETHEREUM: ETH, SOLANA: SOL, DOGECOIN: DOGE, LITECOIN: LTC, OPTIMISM: OP","The crypto market cratered as cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) , Ripple (XRP) , Solana (SOL), and others, plunged after the US conducted airstrikes on key Iranian nuclear sites, significantly escalating the conflict. BTC briefly dipped below $100,000, dropping to a low of $98,467 before recovering to reclaim $100,000 and move to current levels. The flagship cryptocurrency is down 1.40% in the past 24 hours, trading around $101,490. Meanwhile, ETH has registered a substantial decline over the past few days, slipping below $2,500. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is down over 2%, trading around $2,240, with sellers in control. XRP is down nearly 3%, struggling to stay above $2. SOL also plunged over the weekend as bearish sentiment intensified, slipping below $140 to its current level of $133. Dogecoin (DOGE) is down over 2%, while Cardano (ADA) is down 1.40%, trading around $0.547. Chainlink (LINK) , Toncoin (TON) , Stellar (XLM) , Litecoin (LTC) , Hedera (HBAR) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered substantial declines. The crypto market cap is down 1.39% and currently sits at $3.1 trillion. Crypto Plummets As Geopolitical Tensions Surge The crypto market cap plunged over 6%, dropping as low as $3.1 trillion, as escalating geopolitical tensions and US airstrikes on Iran led to a risk-off sentiment among investors. The decline comes as investors seek safer assets, moving funds from crypto to the US Dollar, gold, and Treasury bonds. Analysts expect near-term strength for safe-haven assets. The steep decline in crypto prices reflects the market psychology during conflicts and geopolitical crises. Growing uncertainty generally leads to investors losing confidence in volatile assets. Observers state that despite being decentralized, crypto is still speculative. During market uncertainty, investors want a stable and secure asset rather than a volatile one. Macroeconomic conditions resulting from geopolitical tensions also dampen investor sentiment, especially when higher interest rates can make risk assets less appealing. Crypto Market Stunned By $1B In Liquidations Crypto market liquidations topped $1.3 billion on Sunday as investors reeled from the news that the US had conducted airstrikes at key installations in Iran. With traditional markets shut over the weekend, the crypto market was the first to bear the brunt of the escalating geopolitical situation. As a result, BTC dipped below $100,000 on Sunday, while other cryptocurrencies registered notable declines. The flagship cryptocurrency fell to its lowest levels since May, while ETH plunged over 10% to a low of $2,171. DOGE, XRP, and SOL also hit multi-month lows as liquidations surged. Texas Governor Signs Bitcoin Reserve Bill Texas Governor Greg Abbot has signed Senate Bill 21, clearing the way for a strategic Bitcoin Reserve in Texas. The Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will be a state-managed fund holding Bitcoin as a long-term financial asset. The reserve will operate independently from the general treasury and will help bolster the state’s financial resilience and act as a hedge against inflation. Only assets with a market cap over $500 billion can become part of the reserve. Currently, only BTC meets this lofty criteria. Coinbase Secures MiCA License Coinbase has announced that it has secured the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA), allowing it to offer its services across the European Union. It secured the license from the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier. The license enables Coinbase to offer its range of crypto products across all EU member states. Coinbase stated in its announcement, “Luxembourg has always been a key player in Europe’s financial ecosystem, and we’re delighted to share that Coinbase is officially establishing its European crypto hub in this dynamic country under the Markets in Crypto Assets regulatory framework.” Coinbase has also made Luxembourg the base of its European operations. According to the platform, choosing Luxembourg to expand its European operations aligns with the country’s support for crypto innovation and its position as a top financial hub. It also places Coinbase in a jurisdiction that “understands the need of the crypto industry and excels in regulatory clarity.” The MiCA approval is a significant step for Coinbase. However, it is not the crypto platform’s first regulatory win in Europe. The company has already secured licenses in Germany, Ireland, France, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands. Bank Of Japan Acknowledges Potential Future Crypto Role Bank of Japan officials have acknowledged that crypto could become a significant part of everyday payments in Japan. However, they stress that such a shift will not happen overnight. The bank’s executive director, Kazushige Kamiyama, stated that while Japan still sees a high level of banknote issuance, their usage could drop amid rapid decentralization. The statement is viewed as a nod to shifting dynamics in the country’s financial markets. Japan, once known for paper money, is witnessing a substantial shift, with cashless payments jumping to 42%, nearly tripling since 2013. While the Bank of Japan has yet to decide when it will launch the digital yen, the pilot program, launched in 2023, is running at full speed. Bank of Japan officials are also yet to fully embrace crypto as a replacement for fiat. However, growing support for a digital yen suggests they see decentralized assets playing a significant role in the payments ecosystem. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) slumped below the psychological $100,000 mark for the first time since the first week of May after the US struck key nuclear sites in Iran, significantly escalating the situation in the Middle East. The development triggered panic across the crypto market, leading to over $1 billion in liquidations, impacting nearly 240,000 traders. Negative sentiment spread across the broader crypto markets as altcoins plunged, reflecting caution as investors flocked to safer assets. However, BTC has recovered to reclaim $100,000 and move to $101,885 as markets price in the conflict. According to reports, the Iranian Foreign Minister met with Russian officials as diplomatic backchannels reopened following the weekend escalation. Riya Sehgal, research analyst at Delta Exchange, said that BTC’s current bounce remains weak. “Market structure shows a short-term downtrend with lower highs and lows; possible bear flag forming.” BTC’s gains came amid modest gains for gold and a subdued reaction across oil and equity futures, indicating that markets expect a contained conflict. The Kobeissi Letter highlighted that despite the escalating geopolitical situation, oil prices remain well below levels historically associated with major disruptions. “This market has all your answers: Over the last 72 hours, the US struck Iranian nuclear sites, Russia said countries are ready to supply Iran with nukes, and Iran's parliament voted to close the Strait of Hormuz. Yet, stock market futures are down a mere -0.5% at the open, and oil prices are up less than +2.5%. This is NOT a market that is pricing in a long-term conflict. In fact, if the market was pricing in JUST a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, oil prices would be at $120+. Objectively, the market is still expecting a short-lived war.” Pav Hundal, lead analyst at Swyftx, stated, “We saw a lot of twitch trading in the hours after the US attacked Iranian nuclear targets, and right now, trade volumes remain elevated. If we start to see a softening in tensions in the Middle East, we should start to see a rebound in investor confidence, and the price should start to grind back up.” BTC has traded downwards since losing momentum on June 11. Bearish sentiment around the asset has intensified in recent sessions. However, analysts expect the price to remain above $100,000 unless the situation in the Middle East drastically changes.

Long-term forecasts estimate BTC prices could hit $900K by 2030. The Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 is turning increasingly bullish. This surge in optimism is driven by record-breaking inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs , rising institutional interest , and strong political support, including Trump’s plan to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . With companies like GameStop and Trump Media adding BTC to their balance sheets, and the Fed signaling potential rate cuts, investors are asking one critical question: Will Bitcoin go back up and lead the next financial revolution? What is the Bitcoin price prediction for today? The BTC price may range between $98,286.21 and $102,852.99 today. Table of Contents Story Highlights Bitcoin Price Today CoinPedia’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 Bitcoin Crypto Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 BTC Price Forecast 2026 BTC Price Prediction 2027 Bitcoin Predictions 2028 BTC Price 2029 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2030 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Bitcoin Prediction: Analysts and Influencer’s BTC Price Target FAQs Bitcoin Price Today Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Token BTC Price $ 101,356.35918003 -1.33% Market cap $ 2,015,220,953,444.01 Circulating Supply 19,882,531.00 Trading Volume $ 63,686,709,144.7258 All-time high $109,114.88 on 20th January 2025 All-time low $0.04865 on 15th July 2010 CoinPedia’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Firstly, at CoinPedia, we feel optimistic about Bitcoin’s price increase. Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance was notably weak. However, it made a strong comeback in Q2, especially in April and May 2025. Bitcoin saw a strong and steady rally, driven by easing trade war tensions, pushing the price to a new all-time high of $ 112 K. Now, the question remains, Will Bitcoin continue its upward rally in June?. In early June, BTC is trying to hold support near the previous swing low of May after pulling back from its peak. On June 6th, a positive U.S. jobs report and the resumption of U.S.-China trade talks sparked a short-term bounce from the 50-day EMA’s dynamic support. But on June 10th, momentum was halted, linked directly to rising geopolitical tensions, especially between Israel and Iran. Since then, it has been quite volatile and remained mostly under the 20-day EMA. The uncertainty increased more on Tuesday, 17th June, after President Donald Trump teased a threat against Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. But the US got a “no surrender happening” message from Iran, and on June’s third weekend, the US attacked Iranian nuclear sites. The Investors reacted to the worsening geopolitical situation, as a result, BTC briefly dipped to the $98K mark on June 22nd, breaking the last month’s swing low support, and now it is under the 50-day EMA band, as well. Moreover, Bitcoin is still facing resistance from a multi-month supply block and down 9% from June’s high. if bearish pressure increases, the swing support zone becomes critical. A breakdown below this level could drag the price down to the $100K–$95K range in the near term. On the flip side, if it reverses above the swing support zone and manages to break June’s swing high, then the odds of clearing $112K are possible, and above this level, a certain strong momentum could take BTC price to a new high towards $120K by the end of June. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High June 2025 $95,000 $103,500 – $108,000 $120,000 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 A key factor driving the potential for higher Bitcoin prices is the relationship with global liquidity. Historical trends reveal that as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences dramatic price surges. Now, with global liquidity beginning to rise again after a prolonged period of stagnation, the stage seems set for another major rally in Bitcoin’s value. This shift in liquidity could create the perfect environment for Bitcoin to soar once more. Also, cryptoquant data suggest that accumulation is on top with exchange reserve declining at more alarming rates. When writing 2.4 Milliion BTC were in total on the exchange reserves, which is a strong decline from a year ago when reserves were 3.1 Million BTC.

2025-06-23T11:05:55,"Bitcoin Pepe price outlook as Metaplanet buys 1,111 BTC","As the cryptocurrency market reels with volatility caused by the Israel-Iran conflict, MetaPlanet makes additional Bitcoin (BTC) purchases to its portfolio. As more corporations add BTC to their holdings to diversify their assets, early-stage project like Bitcoin Pepe is expected to benefit from the optimism for crypto assets. Metaplanet adds to Bitcoin holdings amid market dip, eyes 1% of total supply Metaplanet, often referred to as “Japan’s MicroStrategy,” has continued its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy, announcing the purchase of 1,111 BTC for approximately 17.26 billion yen, or around $118 million. According to the company’s filing, the newly acquired Bitcoin was bought at an average price of 15,535,502 yen per coin, equivalent to roughly $105,946 per BTC. Despite the elevated entry point, Metaplanet has maintained a steady approach, underscored by its strong year-to-date (YTD) performance of 306.7% in 2025. This return highlights not only Bitcoin’s robust rally this year but also Metaplanet’s strategic entry points and its broader thesis on Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. As of June 23, the company holds a total of 11,111 BTC, acquired for approximately $1.07 billion at an average cost of $95,869 per Bitcoin. Just a week earlier, Metaplanet had added 1,112 BTC for roughly $117.2 million, reinforcing its consistent accumulation strategy. Looking ahead, Metaplanet has set an ambitious target: the company plans to raise $5.4 billion with the goal of owning 1% of all Bitcoin in circulation—approximately 210,000 BTC—by the end of 2027. This represents one of the most aggressive Bitcoin strategies undertaken by a publicly listed firm to date. In the broader cryptomarket, BTC fell 0.79% to $101,763.35 on Monday as it continues to see pressure from the Middle East conflict. Ethereum fell 0.76% to $2,258.20. The total crypto market capitalisation fell 0.83% to $3.12 trillion in the last 24 hours. CoinMarketCap’s fear and greed index fell to 37 in the fear territory. In the previous day, the fear and greed index was at 40, the neutral territory. Bitcoin Pepe gains momentum with presale success and exchange listings Bitcoin Pepe is emerging as a distinctive presence in the cryptocurrency space by blending meme-driven appeal with a focus on real-world utility and infrastructure development. In contrast to many meme tokens that rely primarily on hype, Bitcoin Pepe is positioning itself with a defined technical roadmap. This structured approach appears to be resonating with investors, as the project has raised over $15 million through its ongoing presale. The team behind the project has confirmed that its native token, BPEP, will soon be listed on cryptocurrency exchanges MEXC and BitMart. These upcoming listings are expected to enhance the token’s visibility, liquidity, and credibility ahead of a broader market debut. The project team is expected to do an exchange listing announcement on June 30. Additionally, the team is actively working to secure further partnerships with centralized exchanges (CEXs) to strengthen the impact of BPEP’s launch. As an incentive for early backers, all current BPEP token holders will receive a 30% bonus on their existing holdings.

XRP is currently trading at $2, down 2.2%, but holding up better than many altcoins. Many analysts believe that its real-world utility, strong community, and growing institutional interest are helping it stay resilient through global uncertainty. XRP Holders Are “Cosmic Royalty” Monerex CEO Mark Otto recently delivered a powerful message to the XRP community, highlighting the unique vision shared by its holders. “ You hold a special cosmic royalty. You see what’s coming and stand to benefit, and help your family for generations to come, ” Otto said, speaking directly to XRP supporters. ""You hold a special cosmic royalty.

These remarks reflect a growing sentiment among XRP holders that they are part of something much larger than just a financial movement and are early participants in a global shift. Wall Street Is Missing XRP’s Potential At the Las Vegas 2025 event, Teucrium CEO Sal Gilbertie had also shared similar remarks. He said that Wall Street is overlooking the true power of the XRP community. Ripple is playing a major role in shaping the future of crypto, and its impact is being underestimated. He had also called XRP “the crypto with the most utility.” Although XRP dropped over 7% in the past week, the investor interest remains strong. In a recent interview, the Teucrium CEO had noted rising demand for XRP-based investment products, adding that many believe XRP could deliver bigger long-term gains than Bitcoin. While he noted the risks of leveraged products, he believes XRP’s role in tokenization and finance could drive long-term growth, making it an asset worth watching. Analyst Edo Farina has also argued that XRP has a better risk-reward ratio than Bitcoin, thanks to its lower price and real-world use. XRP Outperforms Entire Market Notably, XRP is up over 300% in a year, while most digital assets are still struggling. While Bitcoin hovers near all-time highs, many altcoins remain stuck below bear market levels. XRP, meanwhile, has outperformed the entire market. Let’s not forget: $XRP is up over 300% in a year that’s been brutal for most digital assets.

Speaking at APEX 2025, he emphasized that the real competition isn’t in messaging, it is in liquidity.

With an average of $86 , the BSV token price can hit a high of $117 and a low of $55. Year Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2025 55 86 117 BSV Price Prediction 2025 In 2024’s second half, an ascending broadening wedge pattern was developed by BSV’s price action. This was followed by a strong buying movement witnessed in Q4 2024, which began from the wedge’s lower border to its upper border. Many experts viewed that continuation of bullish momentum could lead to new levels higher, but the upper border closely aligned with a strong resistance zone, and that repelled its price trajectory downwards to 2025’s first half, eroding over 60% of its gains. Despite BSV price’s effort to rise higher in Q2 of 2025, the bullish strength fell short to push prices higher, as a result, BSV ended up in another declining wedge. Many had anticipated that BSV would reach the round number of $50, but it failed to meet that target by the end of April, dampening investor morale. The last seen good momentum was in Q4 2024 and which is now sorely missed by BSV investors. In April, BSV reached as high as $47 but faced rejection at the resistance block and proceeded to form lower lows. The recent bearish crossover between the 20-day EMA and the 50-day EMA signals increasing bearish pressure in the short term. Despite several optimistic factors in Q2 2025, price action stayed muted due to worsened conflict between Iran and Israel, and the recent action of the US has worsened the financial sector further. If BSV continues to decline within a downward wedge, then BSV’s price could drop further toward the $24 level. However, there’s a key turning point—if BSV manages to break out of this falling wedge pattern and flip the 200-day EMA band or break above the $40 price level, the trend could shift bullish. A decisive move above the 200-day EMA band might give BSV the momentum it needs to retest the $50 mark by the end of June. Furthermore, if this breakout is supported by increased adoption and BSV successfully clears the $50 resistance, the crypto could gain the momentum required to target $65 by the end of 2025.

2025-06-23T10:52:48,"Crypto Funds Log $1.24B in 10th Week of Inflows, But Momentum Slips on Geopolitical Tensions","Crypto funds recorded $1.24 billion in inflows last week, marking the tenth consecutive week of gains and pushing year-to-date totals to a record $15.1 billion. Key Takeaways: Crypto funds saw $1.24B in weekly inflows, extending the streak to 10 weeks and $15.1B year-to-date. U.S. led inflows with $1.25B, while Hong Kong and Switzerland posted notable outflows. Bitcoin and Ethereum dominated flows, with altcoins like Solana and XRP also attracting fresh capital. Despite the milestone, the pace of inflows slowed in the latter half of the week, according to a Monday report by CoinShares . The report attributed the decline to the U.S. Juneteenth holiday and rising geopolitical uncertainty surrounding reports of U.S. involvement in the Iran conflict . The US Attracts $1.25 Billion in Crypto Funds Inflows The US remained the primary driver, contributing $1.25 billion in inflows. Canada and Germany added $20.9 million and $10.9 million, respectively. However, Hong Kong and Switzerland posted outflows of $32.6 million and $7.7 million, partially offsetting the global momentum. Bitcoin attracted $1.1 billion in fresh capital, marking its second straight week of inflows despite recent price weakness, signaling continued appetite among institutional buyers. Short-Bitcoin products, meanwhile, saw modest outflows of $1.4 million, reinforcing the bullish bias. Digital asset investment products saw their 10th consecutive week of inflows, totalling $1.24bn, with YTD inflows reaching a record $15.1bn pic.twitter.com/HzI5lvxl8L — Bordan Jelford (@BordanJelford) June 23, 2025 Ethereum logged its ninth consecutive week of inflows at $124 million, bringing its recent total to $2.2 billion, the longest positive streak since mid-2021. Solana and XRP also drew attention, with inflows of $2.78 million and $2.69 million respectively, underscoring broader altcoin interest even as global risk sentiment shifts. BTC Stuck in Range as Analysts Eye Breakout or $91K Correction Bitcoin has been range-bound since May 9, trading between $100,500 and $110,800, according to analysts at B2BinPay. The asset is currently hovering near the midpoint of that range, leaving traders uncertain about the next major move. In a note shared with Cryptonews.com, the analysts said that key liquidity levels, including the January 20 high, were cleared out during the May 21 price action. This opens the door for a potential correction toward $91,300, retracing the rally that began on April 7. “A proper correction to that level would not be unreasonable,” the firm stated. However, there’s also a case for a bullish breakout. B2BinPay highlights the current state of altcoins, many of which have already swept their key lows and are now trading near historically weak levels compared to BTC. This exhaustion in altcoin selling could signal a rotation back into Bitcoin, pushing it higher. Bitcoin dominance remains elevated at nearly 65%. A significant pullback to $91K would likely trigger a steep selloff across altcoins unless dominance retreats in parallel. “That’s why any expectation of a deeper Bitcoin pullback should be tied to a significant drop in dominance. Until that happens, the broader market is likely to remain under pressure,” they concluded.

2025-06-23T10:50:44,"Cardone Capital Bitcoin: Bold Real Estate Firm Adds 1000 BTC, Signals Massive Shift","BitcoinWorld Cardone Capital Bitcoin: Bold Real Estate Firm Adds 1000 BTC, Signals Massive Shift In a significant move shaking up the traditional investment landscape, Cardone Capital Bitcoin integration has taken a major leap forward. The U.S. real estate investment firm, helmed by prominent mogul Grant Cardone, recently announced a substantial addition of approximately 1,000 Bitcoin (BTC) to its corporate balance sheet. This isn’t just a casual purchase; it marks a pioneering step, positioning Cardone Capital as potentially the first major real estate company to fully embrace and implement a dedicated Bitcoin-focused strategy for its operations and investments. What’s Behind the Cardone Capital Bitcoin Strategy? Grant Cardone took to social media platform X to share the news, highlighting the firm’s commitment to integrating digital assets into its core business model. This initial acquisition of 1,000 BTC is just the beginning. Cardone Capital has outlined ambitious plans to acquire an additional 3,000 BTC by the close of the year. But their vision extends beyond just accumulating Bitcoin; they also aim to acquire 5,000 housing units within the same timeframe, suggesting a strategic link between their digital asset holdings and their physical real estate portfolio. The decision to add Bitcoin Balance Sheet assets is a bold one for a real estate firm. Traditionally, real estate investment firms focus on physical properties, debt, and equity within the real estate sector. Introducing a volatile, decentralized digital asset like Bitcoin represents a significant departure and reflects a growing trend of institutional players exploring cryptocurrencies as part of a diversified treasury strategy. Why Would a Real Estate Giant Buy Bitcoin? The integration of Bitcoin into a Real Estate Bitcoin strategy might seem counterintuitive at first glance. However, several factors likely influenced Cardone Capital’s decision: Inflation Hedge: With concerns about inflation and the devaluation of fiat currencies, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a potential store of value and a hedge against purchasing power erosion. Real estate is also seen as an inflation hedge, but Bitcoin offers a different type of uncorrelated asset. Store of Value: Proponents argue Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature make it a superior long-term store of value compared to traditional assets prone to inflationary pressures or central bank policies. Potential Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term growth potential, offering the possibility of substantial returns that could complement or even fuel real estate acquisitions. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin provides diversification away from purely real estate-dependent assets, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk (though introducing crypto-specific risks). Innovation and Marketing: Embracing Bitcoin positions Cardone Capital as forward-thinking and innovative, potentially attracting a new segment of investors interested in exposure to both real estate and digital assets. The Fund Supporting the Bitcoin Push To facilitate its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition goals, Cardone Capital announced in April the launch of a new fund. This fund is specifically backed by 10 real estate assets. The purpose of this fund is to generate capital that will be used to support the firm’s planned BTC purchases. This structure is particularly interesting as it links traditional, income-generating real estate assets directly to the acquisition of digital assets, creating a bridge between the two worlds. This innovative funding mechanism demonstrates how established industries are finding creative ways to enter the crypto space, using their existing assets and expertise to back their digital ambitions. It provides a clear example of how Institutional Bitcoin Adoption is evolving beyond simple direct purchases to more complex financial structures. Grant Cardone Bitcoin Vision: What Does it Mean? Grant Cardone Bitcoin advocacy is not entirely new, but this move signifies a full institutional commitment. Cardone is known for his strong opinions on investment and wealth building, often promoting strategies outside the conventional norm. Integrating Bitcoin into his real estate empire sends a powerful message to both the real estate and crypto communities. His vision appears to be one where digital scarcity (Bitcoin) and physical assets (real estate) can coexist and mutually benefit each other. The plan to acquire both 3,000 more BTC and 5,000 housing units simultaneously suggests a strategy where gains from one asset class might be used to acquire the other, or perhaps where holding BTC provides a strategic financial buffer or opportunity fund for large-scale real estate deals. Challenges and Considerations for a Bitcoin Balance Sheet While the move is bold and potentially rewarding, adding a significant amount of Bitcoin to a corporate Bitcoin Balance Sheet comes with inherent challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is known for its significant fluctuations, which could impact the reported value of the firm’s holdings and potentially create accounting complexities. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, which could introduce unforeseen challenges or compliance requirements. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of digital assets requires robust security measures to protect against hacks or theft. Public Perception: Some traditional investors may view this move with skepticism, given Bitcoin’s relative novelty compared to real estate. Cardone Capital will need to navigate these challenges carefully as they execute their strategy. Is This the Future of Real Estate Investment? Cardone Capital’s pioneering step raises questions about the future intersection of Real Estate Bitcoin strategies and broader institutional adoption. Will other real estate firms follow suit? The success or challenges faced by Cardone Capital could serve as a case study for the industry. This move is a clear signal of the increasing maturity and acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, even within sectors as traditional as real estate. It highlights a growing willingness among certain institutional players to look beyond conventional boundaries in pursuit of innovative investment and treasury management strategies. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors watching this trend, several insights emerge: Diversification is Key: This move underscores the growing importance of considering non-traditional assets like Bitcoin for portfolio diversification. Institutional Interest is Growing: Cardone Capital’s action is another data point confirming the trend of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption . This can influence market dynamics. Understand the ‘Why’: Analyze the rationale behind institutional moves into crypto – often it’s about long-term strategy, inflation hedging, or growth potential. Research Hybrid Models: Keep an eye on innovative models like Cardone Capital’s fund, which blend traditional assets with crypto. Concluding Thoughts: A Bold Bet on a Digital Future Cardone Capital’s decision to add 1,000 BTC to its balance sheet and plan for significantly more is a bold and potentially transformative move. It positions the firm at the forefront of integrating digital assets into the traditionally conservative real estate sector. By linking real estate assets to Bitcoin acquisition via a dedicated fund, they are creating a unique hybrid model. While challenges remain, this step by a prominent firm like Cardone Capital under the leadership of Grant Cardone Bitcoin vision is a significant indicator of the increasing overlap between the worlds of traditional finance, real estate, and cryptocurrencies.

2025-06-23T10:49:25,"‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ Author Robert Kiyosaki Predicts ‘Biggest Debt Bubble’ Collapse, Says Buy Bitcoin to Get Richer","Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has issued his most dire warning about an impending “ global monetary collapse ,” urging followers to accumulate Bitcoin , gold, and silver as protection against the “ biggest debt bubble in history. ” GLOBAL MONETARY COLLAPSE COMING? Will you be richer or poorer when biggest debt bubble in history bursts. I recommend owning gold, silver, and BITCOIN if you want to be richer when the Global Debt Bubble bursts. BIGGEST LOSERS will be savers of fake fiat money and especially… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 23, 2025 In an X post, the bestselling financial educator declared that the coming collapse will create winners and losers on a large scale, with “biggest losers” being “savers of fake fiat money and especially bonds,” while those holding hard assets will emerge richer. Kiyosaki’s alarm comes as the U.S. national debt has exploded to $37 trillion, creating what economists describe as an unsustainable fiscal trajectory that threatens America’s global economic dominance. Federal Debt: Total Public Debt Source: Fred.stlouisfed.org Leading economists, including Ray Dalio, Ken Rogoff, and Niall Ferguson, have all expressed grave concerns about an impending debt crisis. Ferguson’s research shows that America now spends more on debt service ( $1.1 trillion ) than on defense ( $883.7 billion ), a historical pattern that has preceded the decline of every major global power. Source: fiscaldata.treasury.gov This fiscal deterioration occurs as the debt-to-GDP ratio has reached 123%, a level that economists warn could trigger a “ debt-induced economic heart attack ” if corrective measures aren’t implemented rapidly. America’s Debt Death Spiral: When Interest Exceeds Defense Spending The mathematics of America’s debt crisis paints a sobering picture that validates Kiyosaki’s apocalyptic warnings about monetary collapse. The national debt has quadrupled from $10 trillion in 2000 to over $37 trillion today, while showing no signs of sustainable resolution. The most alarming development is the exponential growth trajectory that has pushed debt service costs above defense spending for the first time in modern history, triggering what economist Niall Ferguson calls “Ferguson’s Law.” This principle states that any great power spending more on debt service than defense risks losing its global dominance . This fiscal deterioration accelerated dramatically during recent administrations, with debt growing 39% under Trump’s previous term alone. The structural impossibility of growing out of this debt burden becomes clear when examining the mathematics of compound interest versus realistic GDP growth projections. We can both grow the economy and control the debt. What is important is that the economy grows faster than the debt. If we change the growth trajectory of the country, of the economy, then we will stabilize our finances and grow our way out of this. pic.twitter.com/lv07wJne1f — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (@SecScottBessent) May 23, 2025 Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s optimistic theory that “we can grow our way out of debt” requires sustained economic expansion not seen since the post-World War II boom, yet the World Bank projects U.S. growth declining from 2.8% in 2024 to just 1.4% in 2025. Meanwhile, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to reach 140% by 2029, creating what economists describe as a “ death spiral ” where increasing debt service crowds out productive government spending on infrastructure, education, and defense. The consequences extend far beyond abstract fiscal metrics to real-world impacts on American living standards and global competitiveness. Since COVID-related money printing began, the dollar has lost over 20% of its purchasing power, with food prices up 23% and transportation costs rising 34%. This represents permanent structural inflation that erodes savings and wages. Interest payments now consume 13% of the federal budget. They are projected to reach $1 trillion annually by 2033, forcing inevitable cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid programs that collectively represent nearly $3.2 trillion in annual spending. This fiscal compression occurs as America faces mounting geopolitical challenges that require increased defense spending, creating an impossible choice between military readiness and fiscal sustainability . Bitcoin as the Ultimate Hedge Against Monetary Debasement Kiyosaki’s recommendation to accumulate Bitcoin is more than speculative investment advice; it is rooted in a fundamental understanding of how monetary crises unfold and why scarce assets historically outperform during periods of currency debasement. Bitcoin’s mathematically enforced supply cap of 21 million coins contrasts starkly with the unlimited money printing that characterizes modern fiat systems, and has reduced its inflation rate over time. It offers what Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong describes as a “check and balance” on government deficit spending that could eventually position Bitcoin as the world’s reserve currency if fiscal irresponsibility continues unchecked. The historical precedent for this monetary transition is compelling, with every major currency collapse throughout history being preceded by unsustainable debt accumulation and attempts to inflate away obligations through money printing. Venezuela’s debt-to-GDP ratio exploded from a manageable 30% in 1998 to over 300% by 2020, resulting in hyperinflation that made the national currency worthless and forced millions to flee the country. While America’s reserve currency status temporarily protects it from such a dramatic collapse, the underlying dynamics remain identical. The currency is facing exponential debt growth , declining confidence , and increasing adoption of alternative stores of value . Bitcoin’s role as a monetary hedge becomes particularly relevant when considering the limited alternatives available to ordinary citizens seeking protection from currency debasement. Traditional hedges like gold and real estate face regulatory constraints, storage challenges, and potential confiscation risks, while Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and global accessibility make it virtually impossible for governments to restrict or seize. The cryptocurrency’s performance during recent inflationary periods demonstrates this protective function, with Bitcoin reaching all-time highs as investors seek refuge from deficit spending and monetary expansion. The institutional adoption wave further validates Bitcoin’s monetary hedge thesis, with MicroStrategy accumulating over 592,000 BTC as a treasury asset and numerous public companies following similar strategies. In fact, VanEck’s recent analysis suggests that a strategic Bitcoin reserve could offset 18% of U.S. debt by 2049 if the cryptocurrency continues appreciating at historical rates. This would provide a mathematical pathway for nations to escape debt traps through early Bitcoin adoption.

2025-06-23T10:46:32,"Crypto traders jittery as $1 billion in BTC short bets at stake","As missiles flew over Iranian airspace and Bitcoin (BTC) tumbled below $100K for the first time since May. This psychological level is increasingly becoming more symbolic than technical. However, BTC was already back above $101,000 on Monday morning but got stuck between levels, which can make or break the momentum. The sub-six-figure drop, fueled by panic over US airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, rattled crypto traders and wiped out nearly half a billion dollars in long positions. Fresh data suggests that if Bitcoin manages to climb above $102.5K, then the market could see $1.04 billion worth of short bets being liquidated. Bitcoin’s $97K–$102K zone becomes critical Bitcoin price is hovering around the $101k-$102k zone as investors continue to speculate about its next move. Its 24-hour trading volume is up by 36% to stand at $62.96 billion, hinting that traders are moving money amid high turbulence. Data points out that if BTC falls below the $100k then it could trigger $345 million worth of long bets to liquidate. The biggest crypto is trading at an average price of $101,715 at press time. This is a situation where the bulls are being trapped and even bears are sweating. 🚨$1 BILLION WIPEOUT LOOMS IN BITCOIN! 📈If BTC climbs above $102.5K → $1.04 BILLION in short liquidations. 📉If BTC falls under $100K → $345M in long liquidations. 🐂The bulls are trapped. 🐻The bears are sweating. Who will win?🥊 pic.twitter.com/CzXFPX6lhj — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) June 23, 2025 Arthur Hayes, never one to shy away from macro narratives, declared the weakness “shall pass.” He pinned Bitcoin’s recovery on the only constant in the financial universe, where central banks’ addiction to the money printer. His thesis is simple that Geopolitical volatility plus fiscal indiscipline equals Bitcoin’s next leg up. But the charts tell a story of exhaustion as Bitcoin has failed three times in five weeks to breach $110K. The market has digested US tariff drama, Israeli-Iranian tensions, and now direct US military action and each time, BTC has snapped back, but not surged forward. Sentora data marks that around 1.6 million addresses have acquired 1.14 million BTC at an average of $97k, which makes it a key support to retest. The $97,000–$102,000 zone now becomes the battleground. Any fall below, and the market could spiral into the mid-$90Ks if it holds steady, and BTC may finally have the fuel to attempt another breakout. Crypto fears while gold and oil shine At the heart of this stagnation lies a concerning divergence as Retail is fading. Liquidations are hitting over-leveraged bulls the hardest. As per 10x Research, Bitcoin dominance is on a surge, but still, there are two indicators that are flashing a bear market. It mentioned that Ethereum, which was once riding a wave of ETFs optimism, is now unraveling under the weight of over-leveraged futures positions. The report added that even stablecoin flows, which are often overlooked, are painting a telling picture as we head into summer. The global crypto market had printed red indexes all the way around while holding the $3 trillion cap. Fear and Greed is flashing “Fear” among the traders. As Bitcoin swings, oil prices have spiked while the gold price is shining. Brent crude oil futures surged as much as 2.7% on Monday and traded below $77 per barrel after trying to get over its five-month high of $77.79. WTI crude hit $78.58 before cooling off to $76.75.

On Sunday, Saylor posted a chart of Strategy’s past Bitcoin buys to X, captioned, “Nothing Stops This Orange.” The cryptic message mirrors past posts that preceded new Bitcoin purchases by the firm. Nothing Stops This Orange pic.twitter.com/NwtiXWl4MT — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 22, 2025 Strategy currently holds about 592,100 BTC, now valued at over $59 billion, with Bitcoin trading just under $101,000, making it the largest Bitcoin holder among public companies. That figure represents nearly 2.8% of the total supply. Strategy Faces Class Action Over Unrealized Bitcoin Loss, Insider Sales Allegations The post comes amid rising scrutiny. On Thursday, Saylor and other Strategy executives were sued in a Virginia federal court. The lawsuit, filed by shareholder Abhey Parmar, accused Saylor, CEO Phong Le, CFO Andrew Kang, and four board members of breaching their fiduciary duties and misleading investors ahead of the company’s Q1 earnings report. The lawsuit centers on Strategy’s adoption of a new Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rule in January . The rule allowed companies to mark crypto holdings to their fair market value on balance sheets. According to the suit, the change caused Strategy to report a $5.9 billion unrealized loss on its Bitcoin holdings, disclosed in early April. That news triggered an almost 9% drop in the company’s stock price . Parmar claims the company’s leadership failed to fully disclose how the accounting change could affect its financials. He also argues they downplayed the risks of Bitcoin’s volatility. “The company’s profitability when applying its bitcoin-driven investment strategy and treasury options were substantially less profitable than represented,” the filing stated. In addition, the lawsuit accuses executives of offloading company stock while its price was still inflated. Parmar alleges they sold shares for personal gain before the loss became public, collecting a combined $31.5 million. He further accuses the group of corporate waste, gross mismanagement, and abusing their control. Saylor has not commented publicly on the lawsuit, but he continues to express confidence in Bitcoin. In a recent post, he predicted the price of one Bitcoin could reach $21 million in 21 years, a bold claim that lacked explanation but underscored his long-term vision. $21 million in 21 years — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 21, 2025 Saylor Under Fire, But Adds to Bitcoin Stack Amid Market Dip In mid-May, the company was hit with a proposed class-action lawsuit , accusing it of misleading shareholders about the risks tied to its new Bitcoin accounting method. Filed by investor Anas Hamza, the lawsuit claims Strategy failed to fully disclose the impact of adopting FASB’s fair-value crypto accounting rule, which contributed to a reported $5.9 billion unrealized Q1 loss and an 8.67% drop in MSTR shares on April 7. Commentators fear the @MicroStrategy class-action lawsuit sets a precedent for broader enforcement, posing a threat to corporate $BTC adoption. #Bitcoin #Strategy #Lawsuit https://t.co/AXm2CqTHjL — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 20, 2025 The suit names chairman Michael Saylor, CEO Phong Le, and CFO Andrew Kang as defendants, alleging they misrepresented Strategy’s “anticipated profitability” and downplayed Bitcoin’s volatility risks. A particular target is the company’s focus on BTC Yield, a metric tracking the ratio between Bitcoin holdings and common shares, which plaintiffs argue obscured the potential downside of volatile price swings under the new accounting standard. Despite the legal headwinds, Strategy is doubling down on its Bitcoin strategy. In a June 16 filing, the company disclosed the purchase of 10,100 BTC for $1.05 billion , at an average price of $104,080 per coin. @Strategy discloses it has purchased an additional 10,100 bitcoins at a cost of approximately $1.05 billion. #Bitcoin #MSTR https://t.co/p1nrlzuLw1 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 16, 2025 The move brings Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 592,100 BTC, cementing its place as the largest corporate holder of the asset.

2025-06-23T10:40:39,"Crypto Fear and Greed Index: Shifting to Neutral Sparks Hope","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear and Greed Index: Shifting to Neutral Sparks Hope The digital asset landscape is constantly evolving, and understanding the collective mood of investors is crucial. A key indicator many traders and enthusiasts watch is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index . Recently, this widely followed metric has shown a notable shift, climbing to 47 and moving out of the ‘Fear’ territory and into the ‘Neutral’ zone. This change in crypto market sentiment suggests a potential easing of extreme pessimism that had previously gripped the market. Understanding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index Before diving into the implications of the current reading, let’s quickly recap what the Fear and Greed Index is and how it works. Developed by Alternative.me, the index aims to quantify the dominant emotion driving the cryptocurrency market at any given time. Think of it as a barometer for crypto sentiment . The index operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Indicates investors are very worried, often leading to panic selling. Historically, this can sometimes present buying opportunities for brave investors. 25-49: Fear – While not extreme, fear still dominates the market, leading to caution and potential selling pressure. 50-50: Neutral – The market sentiment is balanced. There’s no strong leaning towards fear or greed. This can indicate uncertainty or a period of consolidation. 51-74: Greed – Investors are becoming optimistic or even bullish. This can lead to increased buying activity. 75-100: Extreme Greed – The market is experiencing FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Prices may be unsustainably high, and a correction could be imminent. The recent move to 47 places the index squarely in the ‘Neutral’ zone, suggesting that the intense ‘Fear’ observed previously has subsided somewhat. What Factors Influence the Fear and Greed Index? The index isn’t based on a single data point but aggregates information from six different sources. Understanding these factors provides deeper insight into the overall Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index calculation (as Bitcoin’s dominance plays a role) and the broader crypto market sentiment . Here’s a breakdown of the components: Factor Weighting How it’s Measured Volatility 25% Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to average values. Higher volatility indicates fear. Market Momentum / Volume 25% Analyzes the current volume and market momentum compared to average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume in a positive market suggests greed. Social Media 15% Scans Twitter for posts related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It analyzes the sentiment of these posts and the speed at which they are generated. High interaction rates can indicate greedy behavior. Surveys 15% Polls users to gauge their sentiment. (Note: This factor is currently paused, meaning the other factors carry slightly more weight in the calculation). Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market cap. An increasing dominance often indicates investors are moving from altcoins back into Bitcoin, which can be seen as a sign of fear regarding riskier assets. Decreasing dominance can signal increasing greed for altcoins. Google Trends 10% Analyzes Google search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. For example, a surge in searches for terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ can indicate fear. The fact that surveys are paused is a minor point, but it means the other five factors are currently determining the index value. What Does the Shift to ‘Neutral’ Signify? The rise from 42 to 47 and the subsequent move into the ‘Neutral’ zone is a positive development for crypto sentiment . It suggests that the intense fear that might have led investors to panic sell or avoid the market is dissipating. A neutral reading indicates a more balanced market state where neither extreme fear nor extreme greed is dominant. This doesn’t necessarily mean a bull run is imminent, but it often signifies a stabilization period. Investors might be feeling less panicked and are perhaps taking a more measured approach. It could reflect a period where prices have found a temporary floor, or recent news has instilled a degree of cautious optimism. Navigating the Neutral Zone: Opportunities and Considerations For investors, the ‘Neutral’ reading on the Fear and Greed Index presents a different environment compared to the extremes. Benefits of a Neutral Market Sentiment: Reduced Emotional Trading: When sentiment is neutral, there’s less pressure from widespread panic selling or FOMO buying, potentially leading to more rational investment decisions. Opportunity for Analysis: A neutral market can be a good time to research projects, evaluate fundamentals, and plan strategies without the urgency imposed by extreme market swings. Potential for Consolidation: Often, a neutral index reading coincides with periods of price consolidation, where assets trade sideways, allowing for potential accumulation at stable levels. Challenges in the Neutral Zone: Uncertainty: Neutral doesn’t mean predictable. The market could still swing back to fear or accelerate towards greed depending on external factors. Lack of Clear Direction: Unlike extreme readings which can sometimes hint at potential reversals (though not guaranteed), a neutral reading offers less guidance on the immediate future price direction. Actionable Insights: Maintain Caution: While fear has receded, the market isn’t in a state of extreme optimism either. Avoid making impulsive decisions. Focus on Research: Use this period to deepen your understanding of specific cryptocurrencies and the broader market trends. Develop a Strategy: If you haven’t already, define your investment goals, risk tolerance, and entry/exit strategies. A neutral market is a good time for planning. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Continuing a DCA strategy can be effective in a neutral market, allowing you to accumulate assets regardless of short-term fluctuations. Historical Context and the Fear and Greed Index Looking back at the history of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index , periods of extreme fear have often coincided with market bottoms, while periods of extreme greed have aligned with market tops. However, it’s crucial to remember that the index is a sentiment tool, not a crystal ball or a direct trading signal. Relying solely on the index for investment decisions is risky. It’s one data point among many that savvy investors consider. Combining the insights from the index with technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and broader economic indicators provides a more comprehensive view of the market. Conclusion: A Step Towards Stability? The recent shift in the Crypto Fear and Greed Index from ‘Fear’ to ‘Neutral’ is a positive sign for crypto market sentiment . It suggests that the intense pessimism is easing, potentially paving the way for a more stable period. While a neutral reading doesn’t guarantee an upward trend, it removes the immediate pressure often associated with extreme fear or greed. For investors, this period calls for balanced judgment rather than emotional reactions. It’s an opportune time to focus on strategy, research, and cautious participation. The index reminds us that while sentiment is a powerful force in crypto, a well-informed and disciplined approach remains the best path forward.

2025-06-23T10:32:44,"Crypto markets unfazed by US strikes on Iran","Over the weekend, crypto markets were unusually “unrattled” despite geopolitical tensions buoyed by the United States launching direct airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The development spells a continuation of the Israel-Iran conflict, and has featured in several crypto social media discussions, according to blockchain intelligence firm Santiment. President Donald Trump confirmed on Saturday night that the US military had targeted and destroyed three Iranian nuclear sites. In his Truth Social statement, the POTUS told Americans the mission was “successful” and warned that any subsequent actions could be “far greater” if Iran chose to respond. Crypto market reacts to US attacks with steady hands In the hours following the news, Santiment’s analytics platform recorded a surge in social media references to “Iran.” On June 21, references to the term made up over 9% of all crypto-related discussions across platforms such as X, Reddit, Telegram, and 4Chan. 🤯 With all of the real world concern and uncertainty in crypto now, the price swings for this upcoming week should be simple: 🟦 Retail calls for ""lower"" or ""below"" = price goes UP 🟥 Retail calls for ""higher"" or ""above"" = price goes DOWN 🔗 Chart: https://t.co/5qMBqOZ8Un pic.twitter.com/z10jA3YEL5 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 23, 2025 Over 40,000 US troops are stationed across the region, and fears of retaliation are now more profound. Analysts have hinted at the possibility of cyberattacks, oil supply disruptions in the Strait of Hormuz, and asymmetric responses through allied proxy forces. Despite this, markets have so far responded with caution rather than panic. The Israel-Iran keyword is at an all-time high social dominance, correlating directly with the timing of US strikes on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. Santiment’s data shows that social mentions of bearish language, such as “lower” and “below,” went up at the time of the airstrikes. The chatter coincided with Bitcoin’s price dipping to around $98,200, followed by a strong bounce back above $100,000. A previous drop to $98,000 had started short-term bearish sentiment. However, according to CryptoQuant, no major red flags were visible in on-chain indicators. Bitcoin has since stabilized, fluctuating between $100,000 and $102,000. Market participants may be viewing the geopolitical shock as temporary or already priced in. Consolidation, not capitulation According to market analyst Michael van de Poppe, Bitcoin’s price drop was a classic liquidity sweep. In his analysis , Bitcoin fell beneath a low at $100,500, found liquidity, and corrected back up $101,000. He predicted that if the $102,500 mark is broken, the upward move would accelerate and end the short-term correction. On-chain data from CryptoQuant shows Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) 30-day moving average, often used to gauge long-term holder activity, peaked at 0.6 before beginning to decline, below the 0.8 threshold associated with overheated markets. One contributor on the platform explained that the largest coin by market cap is in a phase of consolidation rather than capitulation. Long-term investors are still holding onto their positions. Still, Polymarket predictions see a 42% probability to BTC dipping below $95,000 this month, Santiment’s social chart data also illustrates the inverse relationship between crowd sentiment and price movements. A spike in “FUD” (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) talk was recorded when BTC hovered around $98,200. Shortly afterward, the price moved opposite to retail trader expectations. “ Everything before the next all-time high is a dip ,” remarked Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao on X. The second-ranking crypto by market cap has struggled getting back to its 12 month high of $4,007, down more than 45% since the December bull run. At the time of this publication, Ether is changing hands at around $2,200 after failing several times to move past the $2,300 mark during Monday’s early Asian trading hours.

The price drop happened late Sunday, pushing Bitcoin below six figures for the first time since early May. Yet buyers stepped in quickly, snapping up coins and lifting the price back above $101,000 during the first hours of trading in Asia. That pattern shows how headline shocks can spark fast moves, but also how quickly sentiment can flip. Altcoins Take A Hit Meanwhile, over the past 12 hours, most altcoins fell about 1.4%, dragging total crypto market cap down by roughly $50 billion to $3.20 trillion, according to data. Experts expect that trend to reverse once major headlines calm down. Market analysts pointed out that altcoins might start to outperform if macro risks ease. They said smaller tokens are already showing signs of strength, even as Bitcoin stalls. Key Technical Levels Hold Traders are watching two key lines: the short-term realized price at $98,000 and the trend support at $102,000. The realized price reflects the average breakeven point for holders, so it often acts like a floor.

TradingView data revealed that Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) kicked off the trading week at $99,640. This figure represents a notable drop of $4,090 compared to the previous close of $103,730 on the four-hour chart. This difference between the closing price of one trading session and the opening price of the next, where there’s no trading in between, is commonly referred to as a ‘gap’. Here’s a quick look at the numbers: Previous Close (Four-Hour Chart): $103,730 Opening Price: $99,640 Price Gap: $4,090 lower This specific gap occurred because CME futures, which largely follow traditional market hours (closing on Friday and reopening on Sunday/Monday), were not trading over the weekend. Meanwhile, the underlying Bitcoin market trades 24/7. Any significant price movement in Bitcoin over the weekend can create a gap when the CME futures market reopens. Why Do CME Gaps Matter for the Bitcoin Price and Crypto Market? CME Bitcoin futures are a significant instrument in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, particularly for institutional investors. Their activity and the price levels traded on CME are often watched closely as indicators of broader market sentiment and potential price targets. While the spot Bitcoin price is determined by exchanges trading 24/7, the CME market provides insights into how larger, more traditional players are positioning themselves. The appearance of a large downward gap like this one can signal several things: Weekend Price Action: It confirms that Bitcoin experienced significant selling pressure or downward price movement over the weekend while CME was closed. Institutional Sentiment: The lower opening price suggests that institutional participants, who primarily trade on CME, are reacting to or anticipating lower prices. Potential Price Targets: Historically, CME gaps have often been ‘filled’, meaning the spot Bitcoin price eventually moves back to trade within the range of the gap. This doesn’t always happen quickly or even at all, but it’s a phenomenon many traders observe. Understanding these gaps is a key part of sophisticated Bitcoin trading strategies, as they can sometimes act as magnets for future price movements. How Does a CME Gap Impact Bitcoin Trading Strategies? For those engaged in Bitcoin trading , a significant CME gap presents both opportunities and risks. Traders often look at these gaps as potential areas of interest. Some strategies are specifically built around the idea of gaps being filled: Gap Filling Strategy (Bullish): A trader might view a downward gap as a potential area where the price is likely to rebound to ‘fill’ the gap, potentially placing long trades with targets within the gap range. Gap Confirmation Strategy (Bearish): Alternatively, a trader might see the gap as confirmation of bearish momentum from the weekend, potentially looking for short opportunities if the price fails to recover or continues to fall. Volatility Alert: Regardless of the strategy, a large gap signals increased volatility. This means wider price swings are possible, requiring careful risk management. It’s important to remember that while gap filling is a historical tendency, it is by no means guaranteed. Market conditions, news events, and overall sentiment play huge roles in determining whether a gap gets filled and how quickly. CME Bitcoin Futures vs. Spot Bitcoin Market: Understanding the Difference To fully grasp the significance of the CME gap , it’s helpful to understand the distinction between CME Bitcoin futures and the spot Bitcoin market. Spot Market: This is where you buy or sell Bitcoin for immediate delivery. Exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, etc., operate 24/7/365. The price on these exchanges reflects real-time supply and demand globally. CME Bitcoin Futures: These are contracts where participants agree to buy or sell a specific amount of Bitcoin at a predetermined price on a future date. They are traded on a regulated exchange (CME) and primarily operate during traditional market hours, including a Sunday evening open. They allow participants to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin or hedge existing positions without holding the underlying asset directly. The gap occurs precisely because the CME market pauses while the spot market continues to trade. The lower opening price on CME reflects the market participants’ collective assessment of where Bitcoin should be priced based on the weekend’s activity when they resume trading. What Challenges and Opportunities Does This Present for the Crypto Market? For the broader crypto market , a large downward CME gap introduces a layer of uncertainty and potential volatility. While some traders might see the lower prices reflected in the gap as a buying opportunity (anticipating a fill), others might interpret it as a sign of weakening sentiment, potentially leading to further price declines. Challenges: Increased price volatility and potential for sharp moves. Uncertainty regarding whether and when the gap might be filled. Potential for stop-loss hunting around key gap levels. Opportunities: Potential for profitable trades if the gap-filling scenario plays out. Opportunity for long-term investors to potentially acquire Bitcoin at lower prices if the spot market reacts to the gap. Enhanced understanding of institutional sentiment towards Bitcoin. It’s a reminder that the crypto market is influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including institutional activity reflected in markets like CME futures. Actionable Insights for Navigating the CME Gap Given the significant CME gap , what steps can traders and investors consider? Monitor the Spot Price: Watch how the spot Bitcoin price reacts to the CME open. Does it immediately drop to match the futures price, or does it hold steady? Assess Market Sentiment: Look at overall market news and sentiment. Is there specific news driving the weekend’s price action that created the gap? Consider Gap Filling Potential: If you are a short-term trader, evaluate the historical tendency of CME gaps to fill, but always trade with caution and stop losses. Review Risk Management: Volatility is higher around gap opens. Ensure your position sizing and stop losses are appropriate for the current market conditions. Educate Yourself: The more you understand about how markets like CME futures operate and interact with the spot market, the better equipped you will be to make informed decisions in your Bitcoin trading . This event underscores the growing maturity and complexity of the crypto market , where traditional financial instruments like futures contracts on regulated exchanges like CME play an increasingly important role. Concluding Thoughts: The $4,090 Gap’s Message The $4,090 downward gap in CME Bitcoin futures at the start of the trading week is a clear signal of significant price movement over the weekend, likely driven by factors in the 24/7 spot market. This gap is a key data point for traders and investors, offering insights into potential institutional sentiment and highlighting levels that the Bitcoin price may or may not revisit in the future. While the ‘gap-filling’ phenomenon is a popular concept in Bitcoin trading circles, it’s essential to approach it as one potential scenario among many, always prioritizing robust risk management in the volatile crypto market . Keep a close watch on how the market reacts in the coming days; this gap could influence short-term price action.

2025-06-23T10:30:19,"Key US Economic Events Could Trigger a Massive Crypto Market Sell-Off","The post Key US Economic Events Could Trigger a Massive Crypto Market Sell-Off appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News This week could be pivotal for the crypto market as three major U.S. economic indicators come into play: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s testimony, jobless claims data, and the PCE inflation index. These events may drive significant volatility across Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies . Let’s break down what’s at stake. Cryptocurrency Market Overview: Bearish Sentiment Prevails The crypto market is currently under pressure , with a 2.6% decline in total market cap over the past 24 hours. Here’s a quick look at weekly performance: Bitcoin : down 4.9% Ethereum : down 14% XRP : down 8.3% BNB : down 4.8% Solana : down 14.7% Cardano : down 15.7% Dogecoin : down 14% Tron : down 1.6% Hyperliquid : down 19.8% Stellar : down 11.7% Pi Coin : down 16.3% The U.S. Economic Surprise Index—which measures whether economic data beats or misses expectations—is currently the most negative it has been in 2025. A weakening index often signals growing uncertainty, which can reduce risk appetite and impact crypto demand. Jerome Powell’s Testimony: Key Event for Bitcoin On June 24 , Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will testify before Congress on U.S. economic policy, employment, and inflation. His speech could directly impact crypto prices. A hawkish tone (signaling tight monetary policy) may hurt Bitcoin and boost the dollar A dovish tone (signaling easing policy) may support Bitcoin and weaken the dollar A neutral stance may cause short-term volatility In the past 14 days, Bitcoin has already dropped 3.5%, including a 0.8% decline in the last 24 hours, now hovering around $101,886. Geopolitical concerns are also rising . Iran has threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil supply route. Any escalation could impact global markets and influence Federal Reserve decisions. Jobless Claims: Another Market Trigger Last week, initial U.S. jobless claims declined from 250,000 to 245,000. This week, forecasts expect a slight increase to 247,000, supported by TEForecast models. Higher jobless claims may signal economic weakness and trigger a positive reaction in Bitcoin. Lower-than-expected claims may indicate economic strength and pressure risk assets like crypto. PCE Inflation Index: The Fed’s Preferred Inflation Metric The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index is due on June 27. This is the Fed’s key inflation gauge. In April, the PCE fell from 2.3% to 2.1% The current consensus expects a rise back to 2.3% TEForecast, however, estimates a smaller rise to 2.2% If PCE inflation beats expectations (above 2.3%), the Fed may delay rate cuts. This could strengthen the U.S. dollar and reduce investor interest in Bitcoin, leading to a further price drop. Final Thoughts This week’s market direction will depend on how these three factors unfold. Powell’s tone, jobless claims, and inflation figures will decide whether Bitcoin can regain momentum or face another sell-off. Stay tuned — volatility is almost guaranteed. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The Tokyo-listed company just added 1,111 BTC to its balance sheet, pushing its total holdings to 11,111 BTC and catching the attention of none other than Michael Saylor. In a tweet reply today, Saylor asked: “How many companies have a path to Bitcoin Sovereign?” It’s a pointed question, landing just as Metaplanet confirmed its latest buy and laid out a much bigger plan. Here are the deets. Metaplanet Lays Out Aggressive Bitcoin Timeline Crypto enthusiasts know that this was not a one-off buy. Metaplanet now aims to hold 30,000 BTC by the end of 2025, with longer-term goals set at 100,000 BTC in 2026 and 210,000 BTC by 2027. If it hits that final target, the company’s holdings would be worth over $20 billion at current prices. For now, its Bitcoin position is valued at around $1.13 billion, based on an average purchase price of $94,695. That’s a 7.8% unrealized gain and Bitcoin now makes up 15.3% of Metaplanet’s total market cap of $6.7 billion. Impressive, right? A Tweet That Got the Market Thinking Saylor’s brief tweet may not seem like much, but in this market, timing matters. Strategy, the firm behind the massive Bitcoin bets, often makes its announcements on Mondays. Today’s post could be a quiet signal that more is coming. How many companies have a path to Bitcoin Sovereign? https://t.co/dP9IgUCHlw — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 23, 2025 Last Monday, Strategy bought 10,100 BTC for over $1 billion, bringing its total to a staggering 592,100 BTC. That position is now worth around $60.4 billion, making up 58.5% of the company’s total market cap of $103.3 billion. BTC Holding Above $100K Bitcoin is trading slightly above $100,000 today, after briefly dipping over the weekend. Despite the volatility, both Metaplanet and Strategy are still adding to their positions and showing no signs of slowing down. Metaplanet’s stock (3350.T) is currently trading at over six times its net asset value which is a sign investors are betting big on its Bitcoin-first strategy. And with Saylor tossing out phrases like “Bitcoin Sovereign,” the message is clear: this is about power, control and who’s building for the long game.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/michael-saylor-sparks-bitcoin-sovereign-debate-after-metaplanet-buys-1111-btc/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
