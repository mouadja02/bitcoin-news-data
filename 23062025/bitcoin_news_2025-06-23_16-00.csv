2025-06-23T13:45:36,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Tanks Geopolitical Tensions Drive Price Below $100,000","Bitcoin (BTC) slipped below the crucial $100,000 mark on Sunday for the first time since the beginning of May after the US struck key nuclear sites in Iran, significantly escalating the conflict and plunging markets into disarray. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency fell to a low of $98,385 on Sunday before recovering to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $100,982. The airstrikes and escalation cratered the market, triggering widespread panic and leading to over $1 billion in liquidations. BTC is struggling during the ongoing session, with the price marginally up, trading around $101,252. Arthur Hayes Remains Confident About Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin’s (BTC) latest pullback does not have industry veteran Arthur Hayes worried. Hayes believes the decline will not impact market sentiment in the long term and is confident about the flagship cryptocurrency’s long-term strength. Hayes believes BTC’s recent price action and decline are temporary, and the broader economic backdrop could soon turn bullish for the asset. Hayes hinted that rising global pressure could lead to more liquidity injected into the financial system, benefiting BTC , and restoring it as a reliable store of value. “Do you hear that? It’s the sound of the money printers revving up to do their patriotic duty. This weakness shall pass, and BTC will leave no doubt as to its safe haven status.” The BitMex co-founder's comments came after Bitcoin briefly slipped below $100,000 over the weekend, falling to a low of $98,385 on Sunday as geopolitical tensions escalated. However, it rebounded to reclaim $100,000 and end the weekend at $100,982. BTC’s recent slide has seen it drop to its lowest levels since May and is part of a broader downturn in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin still shows signs of weakness, as pointed out by Rekt Capital on X, “Two weeks ago, Bitcoin's downside wicked almost -4% below $104400 before ultimately Weekly Closing above said level This week, Bitcoin is downside wicking -5% below $104400. Of course, Bitcoin could very well confirm a breakdown. But until the Weekly Close is in, it's not a confirmed breakdown just yet, and if the breakdown does become confirmed, then we won't be able to rule out a possible downside deviation until $104400 flips into resistance.” Spot Bitcoin ETF Demand Loses Steam Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US experienced a sharp drop in inflows as investor sentiment turned bearish amid escalating geopolitical concerns thanks to US airstrikes on Iran. According to data from SoSoValue, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $1.02 billion in inflows over the past week, a substantial decline from $1.39 billion the week prior. The previous week started well, with Bitcoin ETFs registering $412.2 million in inflows on Monday and $216.48 million on Tuesday. Wednesday saw $389.57 million in inflows, while Thursday was a holiday due to Juneteenth. However, inflows fell off a cliff on Friday with just $6.37 million, down 98% from the average of the previous three days. Friday’s activity was confined to BlackRock’s IBIT, which saw $46,91 million in inflows. However, this was offset by a $440.5 million outflow from Fidelity’s FBTC. Markets have been jittery since the US launched coordinated airstrikes on Iran, marking a turning point in the Israel-Iran conflict. Iran warned of consequences and shut down the Strait of Hormuz, a key passage used for transporting nearly 20% of the world’s oil supply. Analysts point out that oil prices could spike if the conflict continues. Crypto Market Register $1B In Liquidations Crypto market liquidations topped $1.3 billion on Sunday as investors reeled from the news that the US had conducted airstrikes at key installations in Iran. With traditional markets shut over the weekend, the crypto market was the first to bear the brunt of the escalating geopolitical situation. As a result, BTC dipped below $100,000 on Sunday, while other cryptocurrencies registered notable declines. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $100,000 for the first time since the beginning of May as market sentiment plunged after the US conducted air strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites. The airstrikes marked a significant escalation in the Middle East, triggering panic across the crypto market. As a result, liquidations topped $1 billion, impacting over 240,000 traders. However, despite Sunday’s stunning collapse, markets have recovered. While BTC fell to a low of $98,385 on Sunday, it recovered to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $100,982. Analysts believe markets are pricing in the conflict and do not expect a prolonged escalation in hostilities. Iran’s foreign minister also met with Russian officials in Moscow as diplomatic backchannels reopened following the airstrikes. BTC’s climb back above $100,000 comes alongside modest movement in gold prices, and a subdued reaction across oil and equity futures. According to analysts, traders are expecting a limited and contained conflict. The Kobeissi Letter posted on X that markets are expecting a short-lived war, stating, “Over the last 72 hours, the US bombed Iranian nuclear sites, Russia said countries are ready to supply Iran with nukes, and Iran's parliament voted to close the Strait of Hormuz. Yet, stock market futures are down a mere -0.5% at the open, and oil prices are up less than +2.5%. This is NOT a market that is pricing in a long-term conflict. If the market was pricing in JUST a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, oil prices would be at $120+. Objectively, the market is still expecting a short-lived war.” Pav Hundal, lead analyst at Swyftx, believes that if tensions in the Middle East decrease, investor confidence could rebound, allowing prices to recover. “We saw a lot of Twitch trading in the hours after the US attacked Iranian nuclear targets, and right now trade volumes remain elevated. If we start to see a softening in tensions in the Middle East, we should start to see a rebound in investor confidence, and the price should start to grind back up.” However, he cautioned that nobody knows what will happen next in the Middle East, creating further market industry. “Nobody, including Trump, knows what is going to happen next in the Middle East, and that just creates the kind of uncertainty that traders hate.” BTC registered a sharp drop on Thursday (June 12), falling nearly 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,826. Selling pressure intensified on Friday as BTC fell to a low of $102,854. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase, reclaim $106,000, and settle at $106,106. Price action was mixed over the weekend as BTC registered a drop of 0.59% on Saturday before registering a marginal increase on Sunday to settle at $105,561. BTC raced to an intraday high of $108,939 on Monday. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $106,808, ultimately registering an increase of 1.18%. Sentiment changed on Tuesday as BTC fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $105,000 to settle at $104,519. Source: TradingView BTC registered a marginal increase on Wednesday, rising 0.35% to $104,884. However, it was back in the red on Thursday, dropping 0.24% to $104,631. BTC reached an intraday high of $106,513 on Friday but lost momentum after reaching this level. As a result, it fell 1.19%, slipping below the 50-day SMA and settling at $103,888. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price fell 1.17% to $102,180. BTC plunged below $100,000 on Sunday, falling to an intraday low of $98,385 as market sentiment worsened. However, it recovered to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $100,982. The current session sees BTC marginally up as buyers struggle to build momentum and push the price higher.

2025-06-23T13:45:27,"Signs of an Explosive Move Above $110K for the BTC Price? This Analyst Clarifies","Pseudonymous CryptoQuant analyst Avocado_onchain sees Bitcoin’s latest consolidation, after plunging to $98,467 before a shaky recovery, not as stagnation but as coiled energy. Data provided by the market watcher shows that long-term holders (LTHs) are steadfastly accumulating rather than distributing, a historical hallmark that often precedes explosive rallies by the king cryptocurrency. Market Tension Meets On-Chain Calm Over the past week, BTC weathered increased volatility caused by escalating tensions in the Middle East as the U.S. bombed several suspected Iranian nuclear facilities. As CryptoPotato reported, on June 22, the asset plunged below $100,000, with the shockwave of the U.S. attack wiping out as much as $700 million in leveraged positions. At the same time, altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) suffered losses of their own, dipping 6% and 7% respectively. Despite the turmoil, Bitcoin’s dominance grew, reflecting a flight to relative safety amid a broader market steeped in red. Against this background, the latest CQ report paints a picture of deliberate accumulation by LTHs. The 30-day moving average of the Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) indicator, a metric tracking when long-held coins move, peaked around 0.6, dropping well below the 0.8 threshold. This implies that seasoned investors are not rushing to sell, signaling that the bull cycle remains structurally intact. “This moderation below 0.8 still implies the market may be entering a consolidation period, and further price or time correction could follow,” noted Avocado_onchain. “Historically, Bitcoin’s explosive rallies tend to occur when market attention fades and sentiment is quiet, making the current silence potentially a precursor to the next big move.” Meanwhile, data from Glassnode shows that short-term holders (STHs), who have been in the market for under 155 days, are sitting on slim 3% unrealized gains, suggesting limited profit-taking pressure from recent buyers. Price Holds Key Support Amid Demand Slowdown Elsewhere, ETF inflows and accumulation by deep-pocketed investors have notably slowed , with daily ETF purchases dropping from a peak of 9,700 BTC on April 23 to roughly 3,300 BTC as of June 22. Similarly, whale balance expansion has halved from 3.9% month-on-month in late May to 1.7%. Price action reflects this tense situation. While BTC is showing some resilience above $100,000, its recent performance over the past week, where it dropped 4.9%, and the month, where it shaved 5.6% off its price, are signs of the current struggle. The weekly range oscillating between $98,975 and $108,771 also highlights the rejection near the psychological and technical barrier at $110,000. Additionally, daily volatility has been elevated, as seen by the 24-hour swing between $98,467 and $102,782 per CoinGecko data. However, Bitcoin is still outperforming the broader crypto market, down 6.70% over the past week. This relative strength, coupled with LTH inactivity, could be a sign of underlying support building even as short-term demand falters.

2025-06-23T13:40:37,"Green Minerals Makes Bold $1.2B Move to Boost Bitcoin Treasury","BitcoinWorld Green Minerals Makes Bold $1.2B Move to Boost Bitcoin Treasury In a move that underscores the growing intersection between traditional industries and the world of cryptocurrencies, Norwegian deep-sea mining company Green Minerals has announced a significant strategic shift. The company plans to raise a substantial amount of capital, specifically earmarked for expanding its Bitcoin treasury . This decision highlights a growing trend among corporations exploring digital assets as a core component of their financial strategy. Green Minerals: Diving Deep into Mining and Bitcoin Green Minerals , primarily focused on the exploration and potential extraction of minerals from the seabed, operates within the specialized and capital-intensive field of deep-sea mining . Their core business involves navigating complex geological environments and regulatory landscapes to potentially source valuable resources. However, their recent announcement signals an expansion of their strategic focus beyond just physical assets. According to a statement on their official website, the company intends to raise up to $1.2 billion with partners. The primary objective of this massive capital raise isn’t solely for mining operations but explicitly includes growing their Bitcoin treasury . This makes the acquisition and holding of digital assets a fundamental part of their overall financing and asset management approach. This move is particularly noteworthy because it comes from a company in a traditional, resource-based industry, rather than a tech or finance firm. It suggests a broader acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, into diverse corporate structures globally. Why Build a Corporate Bitcoin Treasury? The concept of a corporate Bitcoin treasury has gained traction over the past few years, notably popularized by companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla. But why would a company, especially one like Green Minerals involved in deep-sea mining , choose to allocate significant capital to volatile assets like Bitcoin? There are several potential reasons driving this trend: Inflation Hedge: Many companies view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, given its decentralized nature and capped supply. Potential for Appreciation: Bitcoin’s historical price performance offers the potential for significant returns on investment, which could enhance shareholder value. Diversification: Holding Bitcoin can diversify a company’s balance sheet away from traditional fiat currencies and assets. Attracting Investment: Embracing digital assets can appeal to a new class of investors, particularly those interested in the crypto space. Strategic Innovation: It positions the company as forward-thinking and adaptable in a rapidly changing financial landscape. For Green Minerals , integrating Bitcoin into their strategy could be seen as a way to future-proof their finances, leverage potential crypto market growth, and perhaps even mitigate some of the specific risks associated with long-term, capital-intensive projects like deep-sea mining . Comparing Traditional vs. Bitcoin Treasury Assets Traditionally, corporate treasuries hold assets like cash, short-term government bonds, and other low-risk, liquid investments. Here’s a simple comparison: Feature Traditional Treasury Assets (Cash, Bonds) Bitcoin Treasury Primary Goal Capital preservation, Liquidity Potential growth, Inflation hedge, Diversification Volatility Low High Liquidity Generally High High (depending on market conditions) Potential Return Low High (but also high risk of loss) Regulatory Environment Well-established Evolving and uncertain Storage/Security Banks, Financial Institutions Requires specialized digital asset security (wallets, custody solutions) This table highlights the fundamental difference in risk profile. A corporate Bitcoin strategy is inherently more speculative than holding traditional assets, aiming for growth rather than just preservation. What are the Challenges and Risks for a Bitcoin Treasury? While the potential rewards of holding digital assets like Bitcoin are significant, so are the risks. Green Minerals and its partners will need to navigate several challenges: Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings, potentially leading to significant paper losses on the company’s balance sheet. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still developing globally, which could impact how companies can hold, manage, or use their Bitcoin holdings. Security Risks: Storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss due to hacking or mismanagement of private keys. Accounting and Tax Treatment: The accounting and tax rules for corporate crypto holdings are complex and vary by jurisdiction. Public Perception: While increasingly accepted, Bitcoin can still be viewed with skepticism by some investors or the public, potentially affecting the company’s image. Execution Risk: Successfully acquiring and managing such a large amount of Bitcoin requires specialized expertise. For a company in deep-sea mining , which already faces its own set of technical, environmental, and regulatory hurdles, adding the complexities of managing a large Bitcoin treasury adds another layer of challenge. Actionable Insights for Investors and the Market The announcement by Green Minerals provides several key takeaways: Expanding Corporate Adoption: This reinforces the narrative that corporate interest in Bitcoin and other digital assets is not limited to tech companies but is spreading across diverse sectors, including traditional industries like deep-sea mining . Strategic Intent: When a company explicitly raises capital for crypto acquisition, it signals a strong, deliberate strategic intent rather than just allocating spare cash. Due Diligence is Key: Investors interested in Green Minerals or similar companies adopting crypto strategies should perform thorough due diligence. Understand the company’s rationale, risk management approach, and the potential impact of crypto volatility on their financials. Market Signal: Large capital raises targeting Bitcoin can provide positive sentiment for the broader crypto market, indicating continued institutional demand. This move by Green Minerals could potentially pave the way for other companies in resource or industrial sectors to consider similar strategies involving a corporate Bitcoin treasury. Conclusion: A Bold Step into Digital Assets Green Minerals’ plan to raise $1.2 billion specifically to bolster its Bitcoin treasury is a bold and significant development. It represents a clear commitment to integrating digital assets into the core of their financial strategy, moving beyond the traditional confines of the deep-sea mining industry. While the strategy comes with inherent risks associated with Bitcoin’s volatility and the evolving regulatory landscape, it also positions Green Minerals to potentially benefit from the growth of the digital asset class and diversify its balance sheet. This decision serves as a compelling example of how companies across different sectors are increasingly viewing Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a potential long-term store of value and a strategic treasury asset in the digital age.

2025-06-23T13:37:36,"XRP Price Prediction: Geopolitical Tensions Spur Ripple Sell-Off – Will $XRP Drop below $2?","The XRP price broke below the $2 level during the weekend after the United States effectively entered the war between Iran and Israel. The token’s 24-hour trading volumes have surged by 41%, possibly as this bearish breakout blew up a significant number of long positions. XRP has been consolidating for a while after the token surged near its all-time highs in January. A handful of legal victories against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and a change in leadership within the regulatory agency for a pro-crypto figure – Paul Atkins – favor a bullish XRP price prediction. Meanwhile, the launch of Ripple USD (RLUSD) and the rapid expansion of its market cap paired with the latest announcement concerning USDC support within the Ripple blockchain has also strengthened XRP’s prospects. That said, the market has underplayed and ignored most of these bullish catalysts for the most part of 2025. XRP Price Prediction: Retest of $1.9 Support Seems Highly Likely Crypto liquidations in the past 24 hours have surged to more than $620 million as per data from CoinGlass . This has been the result of the latest developments in the Middle East. XRP dropped to $1.91 and bounced off that level and it now seems headed to retest a former support at $2.08 from below to confirm a bearish outlook. If the price rejects a move above that area, it could result in a significant downturn in the short-term as it means that XRP has broken its consolidation to the downside. Meanwhile, the long-term price trend has shifted to bearish as the token is now trading below its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). Trading volumes at $1.91 were quite high and above the average. This confirms the relevance of this price zone and the existence of significant buying interest at that level. Hence, this, along with the $2.08 resistance, are the key areas to watch in the next few hours. Any development in the Middle East that could point to an escalation in the conflict – e.g. the involvement of more countries – could further plunge XRP as the price of the U.S. dollar will likely rise. In the meantime, Bitcoin (BTC) has been resilient to this downturn as investors see it as a safe haven during times of geopolitical distress. This hot crypto presale called BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) stands to gain if the top crypto climbs to a new all-time high in the midst of the turmoil. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) Rewards Will Be Unlocked Once BTC Reaches Certain Price Milestones BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) introduces an innovative rewards system tied to the performance of Bitcoin (BTC). Starting at a baseline price of $100,000, a new reward will be unlocked every time BTC adds an extra $25,000 to its price. The first milestone, set at $125,000, will trigger an automatic token burn of BTCBULL that should raise the price of this meme coin immediately. Meanwhile, once BTC reaches $150,000, token holders will receive a direct airdrop. These actions are performed automatically by smart contracts that have been audited by two crypto firms – Coinsult and Solid Proof. To buy $BTCBULL and benefit from BTC’s next leg up, head to the BTC Bull Token website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ).

Key Takeaways: Blockstream CEO Adam Back says altcoin season is over and urges a shift toward Bitcoin and BTC treasuries. Over 240 public companies now hold Bitcoin, signaling growing institutional interest and adoption. Some BTC treasury firms are trading at steep premiums, raising concerns about investor overexposure. “TSRY SZN is the new ALT SZN for speculators,” he wrote on X on Monday, adding, “Time to dump ALTs into BTC or BTC treasuries.” Back’s remarks come as public companies ramp up Bitcoin accumulation through innovative financial strategies such as convertible notes and equity offerings. These firms, he noted, are buying BTC “on repeat to increase Bitcoin per share,” making them increasingly attractive for investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin without holding the asset directly. 240 Firms Now Hold Bitcoin as a Treasury Asset According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET, the number of public companies holding Bitcoin has doubled since June 5, rising from 124 to over 240. Collectively, they now hold approximately 3.96% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Back, who has long championed institutional adoption as a path to “hyperbitcoinization,” reiterated his view that Bitcoin-focused companies offer a potential lifeline to traders stuck in underperforming altcoins. “Maybe they can make back their losses by switching to BTC by way of treasury companies,” he said. yes but i was encouraging them to find a way out of alts. maybe they can make back their losses by switching to btc by way of treasury companies. — Adam Back (@adam3us) June 22, 2025 Still, some treasury firms are drawing scrutiny for the high premiums investors are paying. Metaplanet, a Japanese investment firm, traded at a premium of over $596,000 per BTC-equivalent on May 27, sparking concerns about overvaluation. Momentum behind corporate Bitcoin adoption continues to grow. On June 12, Nasdaq-listed Mercurity Fintech Holding announced an $800 million raise to establish a long-term Bitcoin reserve. Days earlier, France-based Blockchain Group revealed plans to raise $340 million for a similar move. While altcoins lack the same traction, institutional interest hasn’t vanished entirely. Interactive Strength, a Nasdaq-listed fitness tech firm, recently announced plans to raise $500 million to create a Fetch.ai token treasury, suggesting that selective altcoin bets still hold appeal.

Last week, Texas became the first U.S. state to create a publicly funded Bitcoin reserve, following the passage of Senate Bill 21 signed by Governor Greg Abbott. The reserve, overseen by Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar, is designed as a standalone fund separate from the state treasury. Unlike similar initiatives in Arizona and New Hampshire, Texas is creating a standalone reserve fund entirely separate from the state treasury. On the Federal front, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve . While Texas moves ahead, other states are retreating from similar efforts. Florida, Arizona, and several others have recently scrapped or vetoed crypto legislation over concerns about volatility and digital assets’ long-term viability.

The post also mentioned that when users hold their crypto in a hardware wallet like Trezor, they alone possess the keys to access it. Because of this, scammers often go to great lengths to convince users to hand over their recovery seed or wallet backup, information that gives them full control over the wallet’s contents. “ Once attackers have access to a wallet backup, they can transfer all the funds to their accounts, leaving victims with nothing ,” Trezor noted. Users are advised to keep firmware and software up to date, avoid clicking unknown links, and verify the authenticity of all communications. The firm also reiterated that updates to the Trezor Suite and device firmware are only done through the official desktop app. June sees uptick in cyberwar campaigns and crypto-related hacks The Trezor incident comes just days after a pro-Israeli hacking group known as Predatory Sparrow claimed responsibility for multiple cyber attacks against Iranian targets. Among the targets was Bank Sepah, one of Iran’s oldest financial institutions. The cyberattack reportedly halted banking services, causing issues for customers. Predatory Sparrow also drained approximately $90 million from Nobitex, Iran’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. On Thursday, Cryptopolitan reported that the group published internal source code files from the exchange on X. Moreover, footage circulated online showing Iranian television broadcasts being hijacked with anti-regime messages. Late last week, authorities instituted a nationwide internet blackout to “strangle” the flow of anti-government information. As of Sunday, the blackout was still largely in effect. According to analysts, the information shutdown was a defensive move to prevent any public mobilization triggered by the leaks and televised intrusions.

2025-06-23T13:28:08,"Weekly Critical Data Announced: Here Are the Critical Data for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP and Solana (SOL)!","As Bitcoin and altcoins continue to be negatively affected by tensions between the US, Israel and Iran, Coinshares released its weekly cryptocurrency report and said that $1.24 billion in inflows occurred last week. “While $1.24 billion worth of inflows were made to cryptocurrency investment products for the 10th consecutive week, inflows since the beginning of the year reached a record level of $15.1 billion.” Bitcoin Becomes the Focus Again! When looking at individual crypto funds, it was seen that the majority of inflows were in Bitcoin. While BTC experienced an inflow of $1.14 billion, positive sentiment also dominated Ethereum (ETH), with an inflow of $123.8 million. When we look at other altcoins, XRP experienced an inflow of $2.7 million, Solana (SOL) experienced an inflow of $2.8 million, and Sui (SUI) experienced an outflow of $0.5 million. “Bitcoin saw its second consecutive week of inflows totaling $1.1 billion despite the recent price correction, suggesting investors are buying on weakness. Ethereum has recorded its 9th consecutive weekly inflow, totaling $124 million, bringing the cumulative total of this streak to $2.2 billion. This marks the longest inflow streak since mid-2021 and reflects continued strong investor sentiment towards the asset. Other notable inflows were Solana ($2.78 million) and XRP ($2.69 million). When looking at regional fund inflows and outflows, the USA ranked first with an inflow of 1.25 billion dollars. After the USA, Canada had an inflow of $20.9 million and Germany had an inflow of $10.9 million.

2025-06-23T13:27:52,"Best Crypto to Buy Now as Iran Plans to Seal the Strait of Hormuz","Late Sunday, Bitcoin dipped below the $100,000 threshold after Iran’s parliament approved a plan to close the Strait of Hormuz , a chokepoint that handles nearly 30 percent of global seaborne oil. This escalation, following U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, has injected fresh volatility into financial markets and sent investors scrambling for safety. As energy prices spike and risk assets wobble, many are asking: what’s the best crypto to buy now amid this geopolitical storm? Iran's Hormuz Threat Triggers Global Market Jitters, Bitcoin Tumbles Below $100K Bitcoin fell below $100,000 for the first time in 46 days on Sunday. The decline came after reports that Iran's parliament voted to close the Strait of Hormuz. Iranian security authorities now have to give the seal of approval for the closure to take place. Do you hear that? … it’s the sound of the money printers revving up to do their patriotic duty. This weakness shall pass and $BTC will leave no doubt as to its safe haven status. pic.twitter.com/PTfZaAXFp7 — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) June 22, 2025 The potential shutdown comes as a direct response to recent U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites. President Donald Trump called those strikes ""very successful"" and later suggested he might support changing Iran's government. This escalation has sparked a fresh crisis in the Gulf, rattling global markets. Fears over energy supplies sent oil prices higher. When global energy security is threatened like this, investors often ditch volatile holdings. They typically rush towards safer assets like gold or the U.S. dollar instead. Crypto felt this shift hard. Bitcoin fell more than 3% in 24 hours, dipping under the key $100,000 mark. But the real pain hit the wider digital asset market. Altcoins led a steep selloff, dragging the total crypto market value down by $90 billion to $3.07 trillion. The overall market bled over 4%. Even the top-performing crypto Block's GMCI30 index , tracking the 30 largest coins, fell nearly 10% over the past week. Smaller coins and AI-related tokens fared far worse, dropping 17% and 20% respectively in the same period. With oil benchmarks like WTI Crude at $76.42 and Brent at $78.53, traditional markets are tense as trading resumes. Bitcoin's next moves likely depend on how these broader markets react to unfolding Middle East events. For now, caution rules. Money is flowing out of crypto almost as fast as it poured in during recent rallies. Iranian threats are not new. It has never completed the full closure of the strait, partly because it relies on Chinese oil revenue. But analysts warn that even temporary closures could immobilize shipping channels and trigger wider conflict. Closing Hormuz would be ""suicidal,"" U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned , inviting military reprisal from an American-led coalition. Bitcoin Price Analysis The BTC price has recovered from when it was dropped into the 5-digit zone. It is currently trading around the $101K mark with a market capitalization of approximately $2 trillion. Over these hourly bars from June 22 to 23, Bitcoin clearly bounced between two important levels. On the downside, 99,200 USDT acted as strong support: during the big sell-off, the price dipped into the 99,000 to 99,500 zone on high volume, but buyers stepped in around 99,200, triggering a swift 1,000-point rally in one candle and confirming that demand floor. On the upside, 101,500 USDT proved solid resistance: BTC tried and failed to close above that level three times, once before the drop and twice overnight, leaving long upper wicks and showing seller strength there. Between these lines, price action has been range-bound, with tight consolidation around 101,200 to 101,300 as traders wait for a clear breakout or breakdown. A break above 101,500 on heavy volume would likely target the next supply zone near 102,500 to 103,000, while a drop below 99,200 could open the door to further losses toward 98,000. According to one crypto analyst named Atlas on X platform, this current dump resembles the March 2020 drop during the Corona crisis. Back then, it triggered a full reset and a 1000x rally. Those who spotted it early walked away with millions.

Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper builds on BTC’s store-of-value narrative with improved scalability and faster confirmations, making it an ideal choice for traders looking for a fast hedge against oil-driven market shocks. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is launching as a powerful Layer 2 built for speed, finally addressing Bitcoin’s long-standing scalability issues. It’s not a sidechain or a shortcut, but a full execution layer. While Bitcoin remains the trusted base layer, $HYPER is where things move fast. It enables instant payments, meme coins, DeFi, and swaps without sacrificing security. The project taps into the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), allowing smart contracts and apps to run with minimal delays. That’s a major boost for developers and users alike. Layer 2 technology lets $HYPER process transactions off the main Bitcoin chain. This keeps things quick without compromising Bitcoin’s security backbone. The token distribution plan supports long-term growth: 30% for development, 25% for the treasury, and 20% toward marketing. Rewards and exchange listings share the rest. Presale interest is building fast, as investors eye the speed advantage. With key features in place, $HYPER is gaining attention across crypto circles. The token will launch on top decentralized exchanges after presale ends. Backers are urged to act early to secure potential early-stage gains.

The spotlight is now on speed, scale, and smarter infrastructure. BTC Bull BTC Bull uses algorithmic rebalancing to maximize gains during short squeezes, making it a strong choice for those betting on market rebounds amid uncertainty in traditional commodities. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) will officially launch on June 30, 2025, ending its presale and opening public trading. Over $7.2 million has already been raised from early supporters. This meme coin takes a different path by rewarding holders with real Bitcoin. No staking or lockups, just direct BTC payouts tied to Bitcoin's price milestones. When Bitcoin hits targets like $150K or $200K, $BTCBULL holders receive BTC. Other milestones trigger token burns to reduce supply and build long-term value. The project blends meme culture with a Bitcoin-centric model. It’s low-cost, straightforward, and designed to grow alongside Bitcoin’s climb. Several top exchanges are now reviewing the project for listings. A major listing push could bring added visibility and liquidity once the presale closes. Social media activity has surged, especially on X, where the team posts memes, market commentary, and rallying messages to keep the community active. Well-known crypto YouTuber 99Bitcoins believes Bitcoin is the future, and institutional interest could bring added value to BTC Bull investors. This consistent presence has helped $BTCBULL build momentum. Community posts often echo themes of accumulation, patience, and the payoff of holding during Bitcoin runs. As launch day approaches, $BTCBULL is shaping up to be one of the more creative Bitcoin-aligned projects this year, merging humor, function, and direct rewards. SUBBD Geopolitical shocks like Iran’s move to close the Strait of Hormuz have triggered sharp declines across the crypto market, underscoring the need for resilient, utility-driven tokens. SUBBD stands out by offering creators and fans real value through exclusive content access, AI tools, and community rewards. SUBBD is introducing a new model for content creators, using blockchain tools to cut fees and share value with both creators and fans. Unlike legacy platforms that take up to 70% in fees, SUBBD keeps its share around 20%, giving creators more control over their income. The platform also lets fans benefit directly. Holding $SUBBD tokens unlocks exclusive content, voting rights, and staking returns with a 20% APY. Creators can earn through subscriptions, tipping, NFTs, and other tools, all without the high costs that usually come with content platforms. SUBBD uses AI to help creators generate videos, voices, images, and even full profiles faster, keeping the creative process efficient and fresh. The goal isn't just faster production, it’s real income potential with less friction, giving creators more room to grow. The project foregoes hype in favor of useful tools and transparent incentives, all designed to place fans and creators at the forefront of the platform. With a presale in progress, staking rewards implemented, and plans for expansion laid out, SUBBD is setting itself up for lasting influence within the creator economy. Conclusion Iran's action to potentially close the Strait of Hormuz highlights how geopolitics can very quickly transform risk sentiment and flows. As oil and equities prepare for volatility, the digital-asset space is a rich hunting ground for diversification and tactical positioning. Whether investors lean toward protocol upgrades or momentum-driven tokens, this moment demands strategic selection over speculation. After all, in a world where pipelines and data lanes both face disruption, choosing the best crypto to buy now could be as critical as any traditional safe haven.

According to crypto analyst Ash Crypto , the daily chart (1D) now reflects a textbook bullish flag, a continuation pattern that often signals further upside in established uptrends. BITCOIN IN 1D CHART IS FORMING A POTENTIAL BULLISH FLAG – $100K IS RECLAIMED – IMBALANCE FILLED AT 98K – BILLIONS WERE LIQUIDATED LET’S PRAY FOR A BOUNCE FROM HERE pic.twitter.com/MCR9jep80v — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) June 23, 2025 The flagpole was formed during Bitcoin’s parabolic rally from $87,000 to above $110,000, and recent consolidation has created a downward-sloping flag. This structure is often viewed as a resting phase before the next leg higher. Ash highlighted that the imbalance of nearly $98K has now been filled, removing excess liquidity and setting the stage for a cleaner upward move. This technical setup gains further relevance as market participants regain risk appetite following a week of macro uncertainty and forced liquidations. With $100K reclaimed, traders are now watching for a breakout above the upper trendline, potentially targeting $110K and beyond. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Key Levels and Technical Signals From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin price prediction remains bearish below the psychological resistance level of $100,000. BTC’s recovery above $100,000 coincides with a bounce from the flag’s lower support. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview While the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) near $102,600 continues to cap upward momentum, a clean daily close above it would offer early confirmation of a bullish breakout. Here’s what traders are watching: Support levels: $100,000, $98,720, $97,095 Resistance levels: $102,625 (50 EMA), $105,276, $110,000 Pattern: Bullish flag with confirmed lower trendline bounce MACD: Momentum flattening, awaiting crossover Market sentiment remains mixed. On lower timeframes, BTC has printed a sequence of lower highs and bearish rejections near the EMA. However, the daily structure holds stronger weight, especially as the market absorbs recent shocks. What’s Next for BTC? The near-term outlook hinges on whether BTC can break above the descending trendline and reclaim the 50 EMA on strong volume. Failure to do so may prompt another retest of the $98,000 region, where the last liquidity sweep occurred. But if buyers regain dominance, this flag pattern has a potential to play out into a breakout rally toward $110,000, fuelled by sidelined capital and renewed confidence. Potential trade setups: Bullish Entry: Above $102,600 (confirmed daily close), targeting $105K–$110K Bearish Risk: Breakdown below $98,720 may expose $97K Despite short-term choppiness, Bitcoin’s longer-term uptrend remains structurally intact. Analysts suggest that the ongoing consolidation is healthy after months of vertical gains and could set the foundation for a stronger Q3. With Bitcoin dominance still elevated and trading volume exceeding $62 billion in the last 24 hours, eyes remain fixed on this potential breakout zone.

2025-06-23T13:20:05,"Bitcoin Holders Remain Steadfast: On-Chain Data Signals Consolidation, Not Top","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Holders Remain Steadfast: On-Chain Data Signals Consolidation, Not Top In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, understanding the behavior of different market participants is crucial. Recent price movements in the crypto market have stirred up familiar fears, particularly regarding the potential for a significant downturn. However, a closer look at the underlying on-chain data reveals a compelling narrative that contradicts these anxieties, centered around the steadfast behavior of long-term Bitcoin holders . What Are Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Doing Right Now? Despite recent volatility that saw the Bitcoin price dip significantly before recovering, those who have held onto their BTC for extended periods are showing remarkable resilience. According to Avocado_onchain, a respected contributor at CryptoQuant, the data indicates a clear lack of selling pressure from this key cohort. This observation is critical because long-term holders (often defined as addresses that haven held Bitcoin for at least 155 days) typically represent the market’s most conviction-driven participants. Their selling can signal a potential market top, while their holding suggests continued belief in future appreciation. Think of the market as a large ship. Short-term traders are like passengers moving around on the deck, causing small shifts. Long-term holders are like the ship’s ballast – their position dictates the vessel’s overall stability and direction. When the ballast isn’t shifting, the ship is likely preparing for a steady course, not bracing for a storm. Understanding the On-Chain Signal: Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) How do analysts track the behavior of these elusive long-term holders? This is where on-chain data becomes invaluable. One particular metric highlighted is the 30-day average of Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD). Let’s break down CDD briefly: Coin Days: Every Bitcoin held for one day accumulates one ‘coin day’. Coin Days Destroyed: When a Bitcoin is moved (spent), the accumulated coin days for that specific amount are ‘destroyed’. Moving old coins destroys more coin days than moving young coins. Binary CDD: This metric simplifies CDD by focusing on whether there was a significant movement of *old* coins within a certain period, indicating large-scale selling by long-term holders. A high Binary CDD suggests old coins are moving; a low one suggests they are dormant. Avocado_onchain notes that the 30-day average of Binary CDD recently peaked at 0.6 and is now on the decline. Historically, a reading above 0.8 on this metric has served as a reliable signal for impending market corrections. The fact that the current reading is well below this threshold, and falling, strongly supports the argument that long-term Bitcoin holders are not engaging in widespread distribution. Is This Bitcoin Consolidation or Something Else? The recent price action saw Bitcoin price drop towards $98,000 before quickly bouncing back above $100,000. This pattern, following a significant run-up, led some observers to fear a potential ‘double top’ formation – a bearish chart pattern that often precedes a significant price decline. However, the on-chain data provides a counter-argument. Instead of signaling a market top characterized by long-term holder capitulation, the data suggests a phase of Bitcoin consolidation . Consolidation is a period where the price trades within a relatively narrow range after a large move, allowing the market to digest gains, shake out short-term speculators, and build a base for the next move. The quiet behavior of long-term holders is typical during such consolidation phases, not during the euphoric peaks where they might start taking profits. Consider these points: Lack of Distribution: The low Binary CDD indicates that the most patient investors are not selling into the recent price strength or weakness. Market Digestion: The sideways or slightly down price action allows newer buyers to accumulate positions without facing overwhelming supply from long-term sellers. Historical Precedent: As the analyst points out, similar quiet phases characterized by low long-term holder selling have occurred in past bull cycles, often preceding the next significant upward leg. This suggests that the recent price action is less about the end of the bull run and more about the market taking a necessary breather. Why Does the Behavior of Bitcoin Holders Matter So Much? The actions of long-term Bitcoin holders are often seen as a reflection of the market’s conviction and supply dynamics. They represent the illiquid supply – the Bitcoin that is least likely to be sold in the short-to-medium term. When this illiquid supply remains locked away, it means that any increase in demand from new buyers or even existing participants will exert more upward pressure on the Bitcoin price . Conversely, if long-term holders start selling in large volumes, it increases the available supply on exchanges, making it harder for the price to rise and potentially leading to significant declines. The current data suggests the former scenario is playing out – supply from the strongest hands is being withheld. Implications for the Crypto Market and Investors What does this period of Bitcoin consolidation and holder inactivity mean for participants in the broader crypto market ? For many, it’s a signal to remain patient and potentially view dips as accumulation opportunities rather than reasons to panic sell. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep monitoring key on-chain metrics like CDD, Exchange Reserves, and Holder Net Position Change. Avoid Emotional Decisions: The fear generated by potential chart patterns like a ‘double top’ should be weighed against fundamental on-chain data. Consider Your Time Horizon: If you are a long-term investor, the current environment appears more conducive to holding or accumulating than selling, mirroring the behavior of the most successful holders. Risk Management: While the data is positive, the crypto market remains volatile. Always manage your risk and position sizing appropriately. This quiet phase could indeed be the market ‘coiling’ before another significant move, much like resting before a sprint. The lack of distribution from long-term Bitcoin holders provides a strong fundamental backing for this possibility, suggesting that the current cycle may have more room to run. Conclusion: Patience Rewarded? The recent dip and subsequent recovery in the Bitcoin price tested the resolve of many investors. However, analysis of on-chain data , specifically the low Binary CDD, paints a picture of resilience among long-term Bitcoin holders . Their decision to hold firm during this period is a powerful signal that the market may be undergoing a healthy phase of Bitcoin consolidation , rather than topping out. As seen in previous cycles, such quiet periods, backed by strong holder conviction, often precede significant upward movements in the crypto market . While no outcome is guaranteed, the current data suggests that patience could very well be rewarded for those who look beyond the short-term price fluctuations and focus on the underlying fundamentals.

2025-06-23T13:10:40,"Iran US Conflict Escalates: How Geopolitical Risk Threatens Crypto Markets","BitcoinWorld Iran US Conflict Escalates: How Geopolitical Risk Threatens Crypto Markets Geopolitical tremors often send ripples through global financial markets, and the world of cryptocurrency is no exception. Recent statements from Iran have added a fresh layer of uncertainty, directly warning the United States of a potential military response. For anyone navigating the volatile landscape of digital assets, understanding these global dynamics is paramount. This specific warning from Iran signals a potential escalation that could have unforeseen consequences, including significant Crypto Market Impact . Understanding the Latest Iran US Conflict Warning According to reports citing JinSe Finance and Jin10.com, a spokesperson for Iran’s military central command issued a stark warning. The statement indicated that Iran is prepared to take decisive action against the United States. The core reason cited for this potential action is the perception that increased U.S. involvement in the ongoing regional conflict has broadened the scope of legitimate targets for Iranian military forces. This isn’t just diplomatic posturing; it’s a direct military-level warning suggesting that U.S. assets or personnel in the region could become targets if Iran perceives U.S. actions as escalatory intervention. The context is the complex and volatile situation in the Middle East, where various proxy conflicts and direct confrontations involving state and non-state actors are ongoing. Key takeaways from the warning: Direct Threat: The warning is explicit, targeting the U.S. Justification Cited: U.S. involvement is framed as expanding Iran’s target list. Decisive Action: Suggests a potential military response rather than just verbal condemnation. Regional Context: Tied to the broader conflict dynamics in the Middle East. Why Does Middle East Tensions Matter for Crypto? At first glance, a military warning between Iran and the U.S. might seem disconnected from Bitcoin and altcoins. However, global finance is interconnected. Geopolitical instability, particularly involving major global players and critical energy-producing regions like the Middle East, has a tangible effect on investor sentiment and capital flows. These Middle East Tensions create uncertainty, and markets, including crypto, tend to react negatively to uncertainty. Here’s how escalating tensions in the Middle East can influence the crypto market: 1. Increased Risk Aversion: During times of heightened geopolitical risk, investors often move away from assets perceived as risky (‘risk-on’ assets) towards safer havens (‘risk-off’ assets). While Bitcoin is sometimes touted as a digital store of value akin to gold, its history also shows significant volatility during crises, sometimes behaving more like a risk-on tech stock. 2. Impact on Traditional Markets: Geopolitical events directly affect stock markets, oil prices, and currency exchange rates. Since the crypto market, despite its decentralization ideals, is still heavily influenced by macroeconomics and traditional finance sentiment, negative movements in traditional markets often spill over into crypto. 3. Potential for Supply Chain & Economic Disruption: Major conflicts, especially in key regions, can disrupt global trade, energy supplies, and economic growth. A weakening global economy or increased inflation due to supply shocks can alter the investment landscape for all asset classes, including digital ones. 4. Regulatory Uncertainty: Heightened international tensions can sometimes lead to increased scrutiny or calls for stricter regulation on cryptocurrencies, particularly regarding their potential use in circumventing sanctions or capital controls. How Geopolitical Risk Crypto Connections Play Out The relationship between Geopolitical Risk Crypto performance is complex and not always linear, but a pattern of increased volatility during periods of global instability is often observed. When the news breaks about significant geopolitical events, traders and investors react, leading to rapid price swings. Consider these points: Sudden Sell-offs: A sudden escalation can trigger panic selling as investors de-risk their portfolios. Flight to ‘Safety’ Narratives: Some investors might buy Bitcoin hoping it acts as digital gold, while others sell due to overall market fear. This push and pull increases volatility. Trading Volume Spikes: Uncertainty often leads to increased trading activity as market participants react to news and price movements. Historically, events causing global shockwaves have correlated with significant price movements in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, though the direction can vary depending on the specific nature of the crisis and the market’s state at the time. Examining Bitcoin Price Geopolitics The Bitcoin Price Geopolitics connection is one of the most debated topics in the crypto space. Is Bitcoin a safe haven like gold, or is it a speculative risk asset? During certain geopolitical flare-ups, Bitcoin’s price has risen, seemingly acting as a hedge against traditional financial instability or currency devaluation in specific regions. However, during broader global market sell-offs triggered by macro or geopolitical fears, Bitcoin has often fallen alongside stocks. The current situation with the Iran-U.S. warning adds another data point to this ongoing debate. Will investors see Bitcoin as a place to park capital away from potentially disrupted traditional systems, or will the overall fear drive them away from all volatile assets? Potential scenarios for Bitcoin’s price reaction: Scenario Potential Bitcoin Reaction Reasoning Limited Escalation Minor volatility, quick recovery Markets price in the risk without major disruption. Significant Regional Conflict Initial sharp sell-off, followed by potential recovery if seen as a hedge Broad market panic leads to de-risking; ‘digital gold’ narrative tested. Direct Iran-U.S. Confrontation High volatility, significant downside risk initially Major global event causing widespread financial instability and fear. It is crucial for investors to understand that past performance is not indicative of future results, especially in the face of unprecedented geopolitical events. What Does This Mean for Your Crypto Portfolio? Given the potential for Crypto Market Impact from rising tensions like the latest Iran-U.S. warning, what steps can crypto holders consider? Stay Informed: Monitor not just crypto news but also major global geopolitical developments. Understanding the root causes and potential trajectories of conflicts is key. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Geopolitical events increase volatility. Ensure your portfolio allocation aligns with your comfort level regarding potential short-term price swings. Consider Diversification: While not financial advice, holding a diversified portfolio (across different crypto assets, and perhaps even traditional assets) can help mitigate risk during uncertain times. Avoid Panic Trading: Emotional decisions based on sudden news often lead to losses. Have a strategy and try to stick to it. Understand the ‘Why’: Instead of just reacting to price drops or pumps, try to understand *why* the market is moving. Is it direct reaction to news, or part of a larger trend? The interconnectedness of the global economy means that events far from the typical crypto news cycle can still have profound effects on digital asset values. The Iran US Conflict warning serves as a potent reminder of this reality. Summary: Navigating Uncertainty in the Crypto Space The warning from Iran’s military command regarding potential decisive action against the U.S., stemming from perceived intervention in the regional conflict, is a significant geopolitical development. Such Middle East Tensions inherently introduce uncertainty into global markets. For cryptocurrency investors, this translates to potential increased volatility and the need for careful observation. Understanding the connection between Geopolitical Risk Crypto market movements is vital. While the exact outcome of the Iran US Conflict remains unknown, recognizing the potential for significant Crypto Market Impact and its influence on Bitcoin Price Geopolitics allows investors to approach the market with greater awareness and potentially better manage their risk in these turbulent times. Staying informed and disciplined is key when global events cast a shadow over the digital asset landscape.

Here’s How To Recover Crypto Losses appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The sudden involvement of the U.S. in the Iran-Israel conflict caused a big crypto crash, wiping out over $1 billion and pulling Bitcoin below $100k. Many traders were left with losses, unsure what to do next. But top analyst Crypto Banter says this crash could be a setup for a comeback—not the end. He has shared his smat recovery plan. Here’s how to bounce back. A Tough Drop, But Not the End President Donald Trump confirmed strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran, calling the mission a success. This sudden move sparked panic in the crypto market, causing Bitcoin to drop sharply and break its bullish pattern. But Crypto Banter noted that while this moment is painful, it’s far from hopeless. Many altcoins are down, but that just means upside potential has doubled. Where there was once 40% profit, there could now be 80%—if approached right. How to Recover Your Crypto Losses Resetting the Portfolio Instead of fleeing the market, Banter made small changes to his portfolio. He sold 4% of his long-term holdings to clear his mind and reset. He also sold 4% of underperforming tokens like Polkadot and re-entered with 1x leverage at better prices—no risky moves, just smarter positioning. This helped him feel more in control and ready to catch the next market rally instead of just hoping to break even. Two Scenarios to Watch If the market keeps falling, we might see a sharp drop to support levels (like $91K or $96K for Bitcoin ) due to CME gaps. But this could lead to a quick recovery, a “V-shape” bounce. If things stabilize soon, we may form a higher low near $99K–$100K, then climb toward $109K. Either way, positioning now is key. What Should You Do Now? Move small amounts of your portfolio to better price levels. Don’t chase after sudden price jumps (“green candles”). Use strategies like dollar-cost averaging to buy at lower prices and manage risk. Accept small losses to free your mind and re-enter at stronger support. Look at altcoins like SOL, SUI, DOT, and DOGE, which are now at rare entry points. Meanwhile simply suggest that “Reset your brain. Even a 1–2% change in strategy could be the move that turns $1 million into $5 million.”",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-crash-isnt-end-its-a-reset-heres-how-to-recover-crypto-losses/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|DOT|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

2025-06-23T13:00:18,"US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Witness Massive $1 Billion Inflow Boom","BitcoinWorld US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Witness Massive $1 Billion Inflow Boom Get ready for some eye-popping numbers from the world of digital asset investment! The past week delivered a powerful signal from the market, particularly concerning US spot Bitcoin ETFs. These investment vehicles, which allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price without directly holding the cryptocurrency, have been a major focus since their launch. What’s Driving the US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Surge? According to data shared by Trader T (@thepfund) on X, US spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively recorded a staggering $1.019 billion in total net inflows last week. This figure represents the amount of new money flowing into these funds, minus any outflows. It’s a significant sum that underscores robust demand from investors looking to access the Bitcoin market through regulated, traditional financial channels. Within this impressive total, one fund stood out: BlackRock’s IBIT. The data indicates that IBIT alone accounted for a massive $1.23 billion in net inflows during the same period. This highlights BlackRock’s significant footprint in the space and the popularity of its offering among investors. These inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs are crucial indicators. They suggest increasing investor confidence and a growing appetite for digital assets within conventional investment portfolios. The ease of buying and selling these ETFs through standard brokerage accounts makes accessing Bitcoin simpler for a broader range of investors, including institutions. Decoding the Bitcoin ETF Inflows Analyzing the recent Bitcoin ETF inflows provides valuable insights into current market sentiment and investment patterns. The fact that net inflows exceeded a billion dollars in a single week demonstrates substantial buying pressure concentrated within these specific products. While the source data doesn’t detail the types of investors, figures of this magnitude often involve significant participation from institutional players, wealth managers, and potentially large retail aggregators. Consider these points about the impact of these inflows: Market Validation: Strong inflows lend further legitimacy to Bitcoin as an investable asset class in the eyes of traditional finance. Liquidity: Increased assets under management (AUM) in these ETFs can contribute to overall market liquidity, as issuers need to purchase actual Bitcoin to back the new shares created. Accessibility: ETFs lower the barrier to entry for many investors who may be hesitant about setting up crypto wallets or dealing with exchanges directly. While BlackRock’s IBIT saw substantial inflows, it’s worth noting that the total net inflow figure ($1.019B) is lower than IBIT’s individual inflow ($1.23B). This implies that other US spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced net outflows, albeit smaller than IBIT’s gains, resulting in the positive net total across the entire group. This dynamic suggests a potential reallocation of capital within the ETF ecosystem alongside fresh capital entering the market. Ethereum ETF Inflows: A Quietly Consistent Trend Beyond Bitcoin, the report also shed light on the performance of US spot Ethereum ETFs. Data from SoSoValue indicates that these funds saw $40.24 million in net inflows last week. While significantly smaller than the Bitcoin figures, this marks a notable milestone: the sixth consecutive week of net inflows for US spot Ethereum ETFs. This consistent positive flow into Ethereum ETFs, even at a lower volume, is noteworthy. It suggests sustained interest in Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This steady accumulation through ETFs could be linked to increasing awareness of Ethereum’s ecosystem, its role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, and potentially anticipation surrounding regulatory developments regarding spot ETH ETFs in the United States. Here’s a quick comparison of the week’s activity: ETF Type Net Inflows (Last Week) Trend US Spot Bitcoin ETFs $1.019 billion Strong positive inflow US Spot Ethereum ETFs $40.24 million Sixth consecutive week of net inflows What Do These Crypto ETF Trends Signal? The combined picture painted by these Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF trends is largely positive for the digital asset market. The significant inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs indicate robust demand, potentially from both institutional and sophisticated retail investors. The consistent, albeit smaller, inflows into Ethereum ETFs show broadening interest beyond just Bitcoin, suggesting investors are looking at other major digital assets through accessible investment products. These trends signal several key things: Growing acceptance of crypto as a legitimate asset class by mainstream finance. Increased comfort among investors using traditional investment structures (ETFs) to gain crypto exposure. Potential for continued capital rotation and diversification within the crypto investment landscape. While these inflows are encouraging, it’s always important to consider the broader market context and potential volatility inherent in the crypto space. The Growing Footprint of Institutional Crypto Perhaps the most significant takeaway from the consistent inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs and the steady interest in Ethereum ETFs is the undeniable evidence of growing institutional crypto adoption. ETFs are a preferred vehicle for many institutions due to their regulatory clarity (in the US context), ease of trading, and integration into existing portfolio management systems. Institutional involvement brings several potential benefits to the crypto market, including increased liquidity, reduced volatility (potentially, as larger players can provide market depth), and further mainstream acceptance. However, it also introduces new dynamics, such as the potential for large trades to impact prices and increased correlation with traditional financial markets. These ETF flows are a tangible representation of institutions allocating capital to digital assets, moving beyond just speculative interest to actual portfolio positioning. This trend is likely to continue as more financial advisors and portfolio managers become comfortable recommending and utilizing these products for their clients. Actionable Insights for Investors What can investors take away from these recent developments? Monitor ETF Flow Data: Pay attention to weekly and daily inflow/outflow data for US spot Bitcoin ETFs and other crypto ETFs as a potential indicator of market sentiment and demand. Understand the Product: If considering investing via ETFs, understand how they work, their fee structures, and how they track the underlying asset. Context is Key: While inflows are positive, consider them alongside other market indicators, macroeconomic factors, and regulatory news. Diversification: The interest in both Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs highlights the potential for diversification within the digital asset space. These investment vehicles offer a pathway for many to participate in the growth of the crypto market, driven by increasing institutional and retail interest. In conclusion, the past week’s performance of US spot Bitcoin ETFs, marked by over $1 billion in net inflows led by BlackRock’s IBIT, alongside the consistent inflows into US spot Ethereum ETFs, sends a clear message. Demand for accessible digital asset investment products remains strong. These Crypto ETF trends are powerful indicators of accelerating institutional crypto adoption and reinforce the growing integration of digital assets into the mainstream financial landscape. As these trends continue, they are likely to shape the future trajectory of the crypto market.

2025-06-23T13:00:09,"Tehran hit again, Fed's PCE index release incoming: 5 things to know about Bitcoin this week","On Saturday, the United States launched direct strikes on three Iranian sites, following a week of Israeli bombardments targeting Iran’s air defense systems, missile facilities, and uranium enrichment centers. This week, all eyes will be on how Iran reacts, and the response will likely affect how Bitcoin and financial markets move, alongside several economic data releases and commentary from central bank officials. Markets react to US strikes on Iran President Donald Trump, speaking after the US strikes, has floated the possibility of pursuing “regime change” in Tehran. His administration had alluded that it was willing to return to negotiations, but the US attacks over the weekend show that the POTUS may not be in the mood to talk. On Monday, the impact of the geopolitical developments was felt across financial markets. The US Dollar Index (DXY) rose to 99.287, up 0.37% from Friday’s close. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury bond yield inched up to 4.39%, a slight uptick of 0.01 percentage points. Over the past month, yields have declined by 0.12 points, still higher than a year ago. The US stock market index S&P 500 dropped 0.22% to 5,978.47 in the pre-market sessions, bringing its four-week slide to 0.96%. On the crypto front, Bitcoin fell below the $100,000 mark for the first time since May, hitting an intraday low of approximately $98,000. However, it rebounded to just under $102,000 later in the day. Derivatives markets saw liquidations totaling over $600 million in the last 24 hours, according to data from Coinglass. May home sales could plunge, rate uncertainty clouds house businesses Housing market data released by the National Association of Realtors showed that existing US home sales declined by 9.7% in May to an annualized rate of 3.91 million units. House realtors saw a 26.6% year-over-year drop, which missed analyst expectations of 3.90 million. The median price for existing homes slipped 0.7% from April to $284,600, though it remained up 2.3% from a year earlier. Prices in the Northeast rose 4.9% to $327,900, up 7.8% from a year ago. The Midwest experienced a 0.4% monthly decrease but still saw a 3.0% annual gain, with a median price of $227,400. In the South, prices fell 1.0% to $247,400, while in the West, the median dropped 2.3% to $408,400, now slightly lower than May 2024 levels. The mean sales price also declined slightly by 0.6% to $319,300. Economists are expecting home sales data from Washington to be released on Tuesday, to show more of the same. Consumer confidence post-Fed statement June’s Consumer Confidence Index and remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell are slated to come later on this week. Data from the Cleveland Fed’s real-time inflation “nowcast” suggests that CPI may be accelerating again. According to economic analysis firm the Market Mosaic, the nowcast shows an annualized CPI gain of 2.6% for June, up from May’s 2.4%, likely due to resurgent inflationary pressures. Since the start of June, oil prices have increased by $13 per barrel. According to Federal Reserve estimates, every $10 rise in oil adds approximately 0.4% to overall inflation. Inflationary pressures will be the centre of Chair Powell’s two-day testimony before Congress starting Tuesday, June 24. GDP and PCE Data The week rounds off with two data releases: Q1 2025 GDP and May’s Core PCE inflation reading. The Commerce Department is scheduled to publish the first-quarter GDP estimate on Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET, with markets anticipating a contraction of 0.2% on an annualized basis. Canada will also release its own inflation data on Wednesday, with headline CPI expected at 1.5% and Core CPI at 2.6%. On Friday, May’s Core Personal Consumption Expenditures ( PCE ) price index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, will be released. Analysts expect a modest 0.1% increase month-over-month. In other markets, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde will speak at the European Parliament in Brussels on Monday. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey is scheduled to appear at the British Chambers of Commerce conference on Thursday.

Source: Saylortracker Bitcoin’s recent price action shows consistent downward momentum,with the cryptocurrency trading at $101,181.34, down 5.18% over the past seven days. The decline affects Strategy’s recent acquisitions purchased at higher price levels. However, the company’s overall portfolio maintains positive returns due to its lower average cost basis of $70,681 per Bitcoin across all holdings. Strategy maintains 592,345 Bitcoin treasury despite market volatility Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings total 592,345 BTC acquired for approximately $41.87 billion at an average cost basis of $70,681 per Bitcoin. The company’s treasury continues to add to its position despite current market conditions showing Bitcoin trading below recent purchase prices. The corporate Bitcoin accumulation maintains Strategy’s position among the largest institutional Bitcoin holders globally. With an average cost basis well below current market prices, the overall portfolio preserves substantial unrealized gains despite recent purchase timing challenges. The continued accumulation playbook follows Michael Saylor’s consistent approach of dollar-cost averaging into Bitcoin positions regardless of short-term price movements. Strategy’s methodology focuses on long-term Bitcoin adoption rather than tactical market timing considerations. He has also maintained steady purchase schedules through various market cycles and volatility periods.

2025-06-23T12:50:51,"Texas Bitcoin Reserve: Strategic Move with SB 21 Solidifies Crypto Leadership","BitcoinWorld Texas Bitcoin Reserve: Strategic Move with SB 21 Solidifies Crypto Leadership A significant development is unfolding in the heart of the United States, one that could reshape the landscape of state-level asset management and technological adoption. Texas, long a leader in energy and innovation, has taken a bold step into the future of finance by officially establishing a strategic Texas Bitcoin Reserve . This move, solidified by the signing of Senate Bill 21 (SB 21), signals a growing acceptance and potential integration of digital assets into traditional government frameworks. Understanding SB 21 Texas: What Does the Bill Do? At its core, SB 21 Texas creates the legal framework necessary for the state to explore and potentially implement direct government investment in Bitcoin. While the initial news reports might sound straightforward, the implications of this legislation are multifaceted. The bill doesn’t necessarily mandate immediate large-scale purchases but rather establishes a fund and sets the stage for future action. It provides the statutory authority for state entities to consider holding Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Key aspects typically covered in such legislation include: Establishing a Fund: Creating a dedicated fund or account where digital assets like Bitcoin could be held. Defining Permissible Investments: Specifying the types of digital assets allowed (in this case, Bitcoin is explicitly mentioned). Setting Management Guidelines: Outlining how such assets would be acquired, stored securely, managed, and potentially liquidated. Mandating Studies or Reports: Often, initial legislation requires further study into the feasibility, risks, and benefits before large-scale implementation. The passage of SB 21 Texas represents a formal acknowledgment by the state government of Bitcoin’s growing importance and its potential role beyond just a speculative asset. It positions Bitcoin as something worthy of consideration within a state’s strategic financial planning. Why is Texas Positioned to Become a Texas Crypto Hub? Texas hasn’t just stumbled into the cryptocurrency space; it has actively cultivated an environment conducive to its growth. The signing of SB 21 is a natural progression for a state already making significant strides in the industry. Several factors contribute to Texas’s ambition to become a prominent Texas Crypto Hub : Energy Resources: Abundant and relatively low-cost energy, particularly from renewable sources and natural gas that would otherwise be flared, makes Texas an attractive location for energy-intensive Bitcoin mining operations. Favorable Regulatory Stance: Texas regulators and lawmakers have generally adopted a supportive or at least open-minded approach to blockchain and digital assets, contrasting with stricter stances elsewhere. Tech and Innovation Focus: Texas has a strong history of fostering technological innovation, from its roots in the oil industry to its burgeoning tech sector in cities like Austin. Cryptocurrency fits into this narrative. Political Will: Governor Abbott and other state leaders have publicly expressed interest in and support for the cryptocurrency industry, seeing it as a way to attract investment and jobs. Establishing a Texas Bitcoin Reserve through SB 21 Texas sends a clear signal to crypto businesses, investors, and innovators worldwide: Texas is serious about digital assets and aims to be at the forefront of this technological revolution. This strategic move reinforces its image as a leading Texas Crypto Hub . Exploring the Vision: Government Bitcoin Investment The concept of Government Bitcoin Investment at a state level is still relatively new and sparks considerable debate. What is the strategic thinking behind a state holding Bitcoin? Proponents often cite several potential benefits: Potential Benefits of Government Bitcoin Investment: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin is often viewed by proponents as a potential hedge against inflation and the devaluation of fiat currencies due to its fixed supply. Holding a portion of state assets in Bitcoin could be seen as a way to preserve purchasing power over the long term. Asset Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin to a state’s reserve portfolio could potentially reduce overall portfolio risk and enhance returns, similar to how large institutions and corporations are exploring diversification into digital assets. Attracting Investment and Talent: A state actively involved in Government Bitcoin Investment signals its commitment to the future of finance, potentially attracting innovative companies and skilled workers in the blockchain and crypto sectors. Pioneering State-Level Adoption: By being among the first states to formally establish a Bitcoin reserve, Texas positions itself as a leader in exploring new financial technologies and asset classes for public funds. Supporting the Local Industry: State investment could indirectly support the Texas-based crypto industry, including miners and technology providers. This potential Government Bitcoin Investment moves beyond simply being crypto-friendly; it suggests a potential active participation in the asset class itself, aiming to reap direct benefits for the state’s treasury. Navigating the Challenges and Considerations While the prospects are exciting for proponents, Government Bitcoin Investment also comes with significant challenges that the framework established by SB 21 Texas will need to address: Challenges and Considerations: Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price swings. A state holding significant amounts would need robust strategies to manage this volatility and potential public scrutiny during downturns. Security: Storing large quantities of Bitcoin securely requires specialized knowledge and infrastructure to protect against hacks, theft, and loss of private keys. Regulatory Landscape: While Texas may be friendly, the overall U.S. regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, which could impact the management and reporting requirements for state-held assets. Public and Political Opinion: Investing taxpayer money in a volatile and sometimes controversial asset like Bitcoin could face political opposition and public skepticism. Custody and Management: Developing secure, transparent, and accountable methods for acquiring, holding, and potentially selling Bitcoin for a state government is a complex operational challenge. Valuation and Accounting: Determining the value of Bitcoin holdings for state accounting purposes and reporting can be complicated. Effective Bitcoin Legislation like SB 21 Texas must lay the groundwork for addressing these challenges, likely involving detailed studies, expert consultation, and clear guidelines for risk management and security protocols for the Texas Bitcoin Reserve . Global and National Context: Is Government Bitcoin Investment Becoming a Trend? Texas is not operating in a vacuum. The idea of Government Bitcoin Investment or exploring digital assets at a state or national level is gaining traction globally. El Salvador famously adopted Bitcoin as legal tender and holds it on its balance sheet. Other countries and sub-national entities are exploring various levels of engagement, from accepting crypto for taxes to studying reserve possibilities. Within the U.S., while no other state has yet established a formal reserve fund like the one proposed by SB 21 Texas , several states and cities are exploring crypto-friendly policies, blockchain technology adoption, and even pilot programs for accepting crypto payments. Texas’s move sets a precedent for other states considering similar Bitcoin Legislation . This broader trend indicates a shift in how governments perceive digital assets, moving from outright skepticism to a more nuanced exploration of their potential economic and strategic benefits. The Texas Bitcoin Reserve is a prominent example of this evolving perspective. What This Means for the Future of the Texas Crypto Hub The establishment of the Texas Bitcoin Reserve via SB 21 Texas is more than just a symbolic gesture. It’s a concrete step that could have lasting impacts on the state’s economy and its position within the global digital asset landscape. For businesses in the crypto space, this legislation enhances Texas’s appeal as a place to operate and invest. A state government actively engaging with Bitcoin signals stability and a forward-thinking approach that can attract capital and talent. It reinforces Texas’s status as a leading Texas Crypto Hub . For Texas residents, while direct impacts may not be immediate, a successful strategic reserve could potentially contribute to the state’s financial health over the long term. It also places Texas at the cutting edge of financial innovation, potentially leading to new job opportunities and economic growth related to the digital asset sector. The implementation details following SB 21 Texas will be crucial. How the reserve is funded, managed, and secured will determine its ultimate success and influence. However, the legislative foundation is now firmly in place for Texas to explore Government Bitcoin Investment in a structured manner. Conclusion: Texas Solidifies Its Digital Asset Ambitions Governor Greg Abbott’s signing of SB 21 Texas marks a pivotal moment for the state and the broader cryptocurrency industry. By establishing a strategic Texas Bitcoin Reserve , Texas is not only creating a mechanism for potential Government Bitcoin Investment but is also reinforcing its commitment to becoming a dominant Texas Crypto Hub . This move reflects a forward-looking strategy aimed at asset diversification, attracting innovation, and potentially hedging against economic uncertainties. While challenges remain, the passage of this significant piece of Bitcoin Legislation demonstrates Texas’s determination to be a leader in the evolving digital financial landscape.

Here Are the Details","Green Minerals AS, a pioneer in deep-sea mining and sustainable mineral extraction, announced today that it has adopted the Bitcoin Treasury Strategy. The company positions this move as the first step in its overall blockchain strategy. Green Minerals Announces Adoption of Norway's First Bitcoin Treasury Strategy With this strategic decision, Green Minerals aims to reduce its dependence on traditional fiat assets and protect its balance sheet in a global economic environment where high inflation and geopolitical uncertainties are increasing. “A strong balance sheet is more important than ever at a time of such monetary policy expansion. Bitcoin’s decentralized and inflation-resistant nature offers a powerful alternative to traditional money.” Green Minerals plans to make Bitcoin treasury the core asset in a financing plan of up to $1.2 billion with its partners. This goal coincides with the company’s first HEDSM (Hedge-Enabled Digital Strategy Model) to be launched within the framework of the “Responsible Production Partnership”. The company also plans to collaborate with expert advisors to conduct Bitcoin purchases in a “transparent and secure framework.” In this context, a new performance indicator, “Bitcoin per share (BTC/share),” will be introduced. This will provide investors with a system that will directly track the value of the digital asset falling on their shares. Green Minerals plans to leverage blockchain technology not only in the financial arena, but also in areas such as supply chain transparency, certification of mineral origins, and operational efficiency. By integrating this technology throughout the value chain, the company aims to pioneer future regulations and maintain its competitiveness in the sector. Green Minerals has announced that it aims to make its first Bitcoin purchase in the next few days. The company has pledged to be transparent about every stage of the process. With this strategic move, Green Minerals not only consolidates its leadership in sustainable mining, but also takes a pioneering stance in the financial and technological fields. *This is not investment advice.

I (CCCM), a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) sponsored by an affiliate of Cohen & Company. The transaction, announced Monday, positions the new entity, ProCap Financial, Inc., as one of the largest bitcoin treasuries ever to hit public markets. In what’s being called the largest initial fundraise for a public bitcoin BTC treasury company to date, ProCap raised $550 million in preferred equity and secured $225 million in convertible notes, giving future shareholders immediate exposure to bitcoin through a structure designed to acquire BTC ahead of the deal's close. Led by Pompliano, a well-known investor and vocal bitcoin advocate, ProCap aims to operate at the intersection of digital assets and traditional finance. The company plans to generate profit not just by holding BTC but by actively deploying its bitcoin balance sheet across yield-generating strategies that mitigate risk and capitalize on crypto-financial infrastructure. ""The legacy financial system is being disrupted by bitcoin,"" Pompliano said in a statement. ""ProCap Financial represents our solution to the increasing demand for bitcoin-native financial services among sophisticated investors."" The merger values the combined entity at up to $1 billion, depending on the final bitcoin purchase price at closing. ProCap’s BTC assets will be custodied until the transaction completes, giving investors near-instant BTC exposure without waiting for the company to go public. The transaction is expected to close before the end of 2025, pending SEC review and shareholder approval. The Financial Times first reported that Pompliano was set to become the CEO of ProCap BTC, and that the company was planning to raise $750 million to acquire bitcoin.

2025-06-23T12:47:22,"Reactions As Cointelegraph Asks Crypto Community to Describe XRP In 3 Words","A recent post by leading crypto news outlet Cointelegraph has sparked a wave of passionate and creative reactions from the XRP community. In a simple yet thought-provoking prompt, Cointelegraph asked on X: “Describe $XRP in 3 words.” The post quickly went viral, drawing responses from top influencers, analysts, and long-time XRP holders, each offering their take on what the asset truly represents. Community Voices: Strong Belief in XRP’s Potential Veteran XRP advocate The Bearable Bull responded with “Most Undervalued Asset,” capturing a sentiment widely shared by the XRP community. Many believe XRP’s true value remains unrealized due to years of regulatory challenges and market suppression, despite its solid use case in cross-border payments. Edo Farina, CEO of Alpha Lions Academy and a vocal supporter of XRP, responded with “Better Than Bitcoin.” This bold comparison reflects a long-standing debate in the crypto space, where XRP enthusiasts argue the token is faster, cheaper, and more scalable than Bitcoin, especially for financial institutions. Describe $XRP in 3 words. pic.twitter.com/92JpownEg9 — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) June 22, 2025 Popular chart analyst Dark Defender delivered a succinct and confident take: “The One.” His choice of words suggests XRP is not just another altcoin, but the digital asset that will play a central role in the future financial system. Realism, Sarcasm, and Frustration Not all reactions were purely optimistic. Influencer JD offered a more ironic view, saying: “Rekt many people” and “I’m calling TOP.” These comments reflect the frustration of investors who have held through multiple price crashes, long periods of stagnation, and unfulfilled bullish predictions. While XRP boasts significant utility, the lack of consistent price appreciation has tested the patience of many long-time holders. Still, faith in the long-term vision remains strong for others. POW Group labeled XRP “The Chosen One,” reaffirming a common belief that XRP was designed for a specific purpose— solving global liquidity problems . Similarly, Calogero urged followers to “Trust the Process,” a mantra often used by those taking a long-term, fundamentals-based approach to investing. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional Narrative and Broader Vision Perhaps one of the most intriguing responses came from Vandell of Black Swan Capitalist, who described XRP as “The PayPal Mafia.” Though cryptic, this phrase may suggest that XRP and Ripple are cultivating a network of influential partners, akin to how PayPal alumni went on to shape the tech industry, who are poised to disrupt global finance . Two influential accounts, Nick of Crypto Crusader and the Good Morning Crypto podcast, both used the term “Internet of Value.” This phrase has become synonymous with Ripple’s long-term vision: enabling value to move across borders as easily and quickly as information moves today. XRP, in this vision, serves as the core liquidity bridge in a new global payments infrastructure. A Community Still Deeply Invested While Cointelegraph’s question may have seemed casual, the responses revealed deep emotional investment and ongoing engagement within the XRP community. Whether through hopeful optimism, tempered realism, or strategic foresight, one thing is clear—XRP continues to inspire conversation, loyalty, and belief. As Ripple moves forward with global partnerships and regulatory developments, XRP remains a central topic in the evolving digital economy, described in just three words, but backed by years of conviction.
