2025-06-23T03:54:21,"Metaplanet Adds $118M in Bitcoin Amid Market Dip, Crosses $1B in Holdings","Metaplanet has purchased an additional 1,111 Bitcoin for $118.2 million, the Tokyo-listed investment firm said on Monday. The average purchase price was approximately $106,408 per Bitcoin. The leading cryptocurrency has dropped over 4% in the last week, now trading at just above $101,000. With this latest acquisition, the company now holds 11,111 BTC on its balance sheet, valued at over $1.07 billion. The average cost basis stands at $95,869 per coin. Metaplanet shares traded down 3.5% today. This marks a major milestone in Metaplanet’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy, which began mid-2024 and accelerated through early 2025. Metaplanet’s total stash has grown nearly 28-fold since December 2024. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 1,111 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 11,111 BTC* pic.twitter.com/7ceEeSh1X4 — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) June 23, 2025 Metaplanet Reports Quarter to Date BTC Yield of 107.9% Metaplanet reports a quarter-to-date BTC yield of 107.9%, up from 95.6% in Q1 and 309.8% in Q4 2024. The metric, which the firm uses as a key performance indicator, tracks Bitcoin per fully diluted share over time, excluding the effects of dilution. The firm also posted a BTC gain of 4,367 BTC for $451.2 million for the ongoing quarter, based on reference prices from Bitflyer. The company has funded its Bitcoin purchases through a series of capital market activities, including multiple zero-coupon bond issuances and equity-based instruments. Since January, Metaplanet has issued and redeemed more than a dozen series of ordinary bonds and stock acquisition rights, largely subscribed by EVO FUND . Over 210 million shares have been issued under its “210 Million Plan.” Metaplanet Wants to Buy 210,000 BTC by 2027 Often dubbed as Japan’s Strategy, the company aims to buy 210,000 Bitcoins by the end 2027. Between May and June 2025 alone, Metaplanet raised over $300 million through bonds and exercised stock rights, with proceeds explicitly allocated for Bitcoin accumulation. The company formalized Bitcoin Treasury Operations as a core business line in December 2024, a pivot from its hotel management business. Since then, it has disclosed regular updates on its BTC position, including total holdings, cost basis, and share dilution metrics. As of June 23, Metaplanet’s fully diluted share count stood at 759 million, with Bitcoin per 1,000 fully diluted shares reaching 0.0146 BTC. The company has not indicated a halt or slowdown in its Bitcoin acquisition strategy. It continues to use capital raised through financial instruments to increase exposure to the digital asset, in line with its stated goal of enhancing shareholder value through BTC accumulation.

The price of Pi Coin recently dropped below $0.50, even testing $0.47 before making a slight recovery. At the time of writing, Pi is trying to hold above $0.50, which has become an important support level. But it’s not just Pi facing tough times. Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum also took a hit as tensions between the U.S. and Iran increased. Bitcoin even fell below $100,000 for the first time in months. Founder Steps In to Calm Supporters As Pi’s price continued to drop, Pi Network founder Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis took to social media to address worried investors, known as Pioneers. He assured them that this is just a temporary market phase, not a permanent crash. However, not everyone was convinced. One frustrated user commented, “Are you a scammer or a fraud? Does Pi fall every day? Support Pi and raise it.” To this, Dr. Kokkalis replied, “Do you know about crypto? Why are other cryptos going down?” But the user wasn’t satisfied and said, “Since I bought Pi, it has been falling. I’ve seen 3 ups and 5 downs. I have no confidence in Pi anymore. I will cut my losses and won’t invest in companies like yours.” Is Pi Headed Below $0.40? Currently, Pi Coin is under pressure. Experts say it will need a positive market shift to rise above $0.60. Crypto analyst Dr. Altcoin predicted that Pi is now firmly in the $0.40 range and might stay there until the end of August. He also said that the upcoming Pi Day 2 event is unlikely to push the price higher.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/pi-network-founder-slammed-as-scammer-for-defending-price-crash-he-responds/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-06-23T03:30:10,"Bitcoin Crashed Below $100,000 Amid US Airstrikes On Iran And Market Sell-Off","The market’s leading crypto, Bitcoin (BTC), dipped below the $100,000 mark for the first time in over a month on Sunday, following US airstrikes on Iran as conflicts in the middle east continue to escalate. This decline, which saw the Bitcoin price drop approximately 4% to around $99,300, coincided with a broader market sell-off, with Ethereum (ETH) experiencing an even sharper decline of nearly 10%. Overall, the total cryptocurrency market took a significant hit, falling about 7% in just 24 hours. Geopolitical Unrest And Tariff Troubles The timing of this downturn was particularly notable, occurring just hours after the US targeted three key nuclear sites in Iran. Tensions had escalated following a United Nations report that indicated Iran was not adhering to international prohibitions against developing a military nuclear program. In response to these revelations, Israel conducted strikes against Iran, leading to further retaliation from the Islamic Republic. On Saturday, President Donald Trump declared on social media: This is an HISTORIC MOMENT FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ISRAEL, AND THE WORLD. IRAN MUST NOW AGREE TO END THIS WAR. THANK YOU! Related Reading: Solana Cracks Below Key Structure – Head And Shoulders Breakdown Points To $106 This recent plummet below the psychologically significant $100,000 threshold follows a year of substantial gains for Bitcoin. After Trump took office in January, Bitcoin reached all-time highs above $100,000 in February, buoyed by executive orders aimed at supporting the cryptocurrency sector. However, the cryptocurrency’s price soon mirrored the broader declines in financial markets, particularly after Trump announced severe tariffs in April, which saw Bitcoin fall to nearly $75,000, its lowest point in 2025. Despite this volatility, Bitcoin had seen a resurgence, particularly in May when it reached new highs as Wall Street investors returned to the cryptocurrency through US exchange-traded funds (ETFs). However, by late Sunday, there were signs of recovery, with Bitcoin trading approximately at $101,300, down only 1% over the previous day, while ETH managed to pare its losses to around $2,200. Forced Liquidations Exacerbate Bitcoin Sell-Off According to CNBC, Iran has also threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial shipping route responsible for approximately 20% of the global oil supply, further adding to the broader financial uncertainty. JPMorgan warned that such a blockade could drive oil prices up to $130 per barrel, which would have significant implications for US inflation, potentially pushing it back toward 5%—a level not seen since March 2023. While Bitcoin has often been promoted as an inflation hedge, its recent behavior aligns more closely with that of high-beta tech stocks. Data from crypto provider Kaiko indicates that Bitcoin’s correlation with the tech-heavy Nasdaq has increased sharply in recent weeks, particularly following the surge in inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. Related Reading: $312M ETH Transfer Triggers Sell-Off Fears As Ethereum Price Crashes Below Support Institutional investment patterns have also shifted. More than $1.04 billion flowed into spot Bitcoin ETFs from Monday to Wednesday last week, but this momentum dissipated as the weekend approached, with minimal net movement on Thursday and only $6.4 million on Friday. The technical aspects of the market further exacerbated the sell-off. Research from CoinGlass revealed that Bitcoin’s drop below $99,000 triggered forced liquidations across offshore derivatives platforms, including Binance and Bybit. During this period, over $1 billion in crypto positions were liquidated within 24 hours, with more than 95% of these coming from long positions, highlighting the market’s overexposure.

2025-06-23T02:10:58,"Bitcoin dives, rebounds, then tanks again as ETF flows collapse","Markets went straight into meltdown mode Sunday night after the United States bombed Iran in a direct military strike and Iran retaliated by shutting down Strait of Hormuz, the most important oil route on the planet. That has triggered violent selloffs across every major market, from stocks to Bitcoin, from oil to the dollar and the euro. The world’s financial system is now reacting like it just got sucker punched. Its unlike anything we have ever seen. Oil was first to go wild. In the first trading session after the futures market opened, US crude rose $1.76, or 2.38%, to $75.60 per barrel. Brent crude climbed $1.80, or 2.34%, landing at $78.81. Brent even briefly touched $81, which was a 5.7% spike, before it slipped back. By press time, the price gains were gone. Oil was down 0.5%, which made no sense to anyone watching. Traders are now locked on Tehran, waiting to see what it does next. Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, Iran’s foreign minister, said Sunday that Iran reserves “ all options ” to defend its sovereignty. S&P Global Platts noted the price surge could reverse entirely if Iran chooses not to respond. Bitcoin dives, rebounds, then tanks again as ETF flows collapse The crypto market didn’t waste a second. Bitcoin had dropped to $98,000 on Sunday. That was its lowest point in over a month. Less than an hour later, it swung back above $102,000, before slipping again. At the time of writing, it sat at $100,879. The market was a disaster. More than $1 billion in crypto positions were liquidated in just 24 hours, and over 95% were long bets. Source: TradingView Things got uglier when inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs dried up. Between Monday and Wednesday, $1.04 billion had gone in, based on CoinGlass data. But by Thursday, that number was flat. On Friday, just $6.4 million came in. That was the same day President Donald Trump left the G7 early and announced a two-week review of US options on Iran. The assumption that Bitcoin would act like a safe haven collapsed. It started trading like a risky tech stock instead. Kaiko, a crypto data provider, said Bitcoin’s correlation with the Nasdaq had surged quite fast in recent weeks. Stock indexes bleed across Asia, Europe, and US futures Futures tied to US stocks also started dropping. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 109 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 futures lost 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.4%. Asian markets opened deep in the red too. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 dropped 0.56%, and the Topix fell 0.49%. The worst-hit companies were all in tech: Screen Holdings crashed 4.78%, Lasertec Corp sank 4.31%, and Disco Corp went down 3.38%. Big names like Advantest and Softbank didn’t escape either, falling 1.66% and 0.76%. It was the same story in South Korea. The Kospi index lost 1.05%. The Kosdaq, which includes smaller-cap companies, got hit even harder, down 1.78%. The country’s top automakers took the brunt. Hyundai Motor shares dropped 4.05%, and Kia Corp fell 4.15%. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 also took a dive, down 0.76%. In Hong Kong, futures for the Hang Seng Index pointed to more losses. They stood at 23,396, well below the index’s last close of 23,530.48, suggesting more downside ahead. Japanese carmakers had no luck either. As of press time, Nissan Motor dropped 2.22%, and Mazda Motor was down 2.17%. Mitsubishi Motors lost 1.87%, Honda Motor slid 1.55%, and Toyota dropped 1.36%. Over in Europe, markets weren’t much better. The IBEX 35 rose 0.77%, closing at 13,850.3, and Germany’s DAX jumped 1.27% to 23,350.55. But the FTSE in London dropped 0.2% to 8,774.65, and France’s CAC 40 was completely flat at 7,589.66. The STOXX600, a broader European index, barely moved, up just 0.13% to 536.53.

2025-06-23T01:36:19,"Asia Morning Briefing: BTC Reclaims 100K as Markets Shrug off Iran Strike","Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins the trading week, BTC is trading above $100,500 as the initial volatility from news over the weekend that the U.S. struck some of Iran's nuclear facilities begins to subside. While prices briefly dipped below six figures on Sunday in a risk-off reaction , markets have since stabilized. Equity futures are flat, and gold is up only marginally, suggesting that traders are not yet pricing in a broader escalation. The lack of follow-through in traditional markets may reflect expectations that Iran’s response will be contained or delayed, rather than immediate and destabilizing. Crude oil is holding its gains near $76 per barrel after spiking nearly 4% Sunday evening on fears that Iran could block the Strait of Hormuz, a key chokepoint for global oil shipments. Still, commentary from U.S. officials and muted early-week trading suggest that investors remain in a wait-and-see mode. In crypto markets, altcoins that had mirrored BTC’s weekend drop, like ETH, XRP, and SOL, are also clawing back losses. For now, the market appears to be treating the U.S.-Iran clash as a geopolitical flashpoint, not a structural break. OKX Considering U.S. IPO: Report Crypto exchange OKX is considering a public listing in the U.S., according to a report from The Information . Earlier this year, the exchange announced a U.S. expansion after settling with the Department of Justice over accusations that it operated in the country without a money transmitter license. Among other crypto-linked companies, Bullish, a competitor to OKX and the parent company of CoinDesk, is also said to be considering an IPO given investors' appetite for companies with exposure to digital assets. OKX told CoinDesk it had no comment on the matter. Polymarket Bettors Less Certain About Second U.S. Strike on Iran Polymarket bettors are cooling to the idea that the U.S will hit Iran a second time before the end of the month. The 'yes' side of a contract asking if the U.S. will conduct another military action on Iran by June 30 is now trading at 54%, from 74% in the hours after the initial strike on Iranian nuclear sites. There appears to be a growing market belief that deconfliction – on both sides – is on the agenda, as evidenced by another contract asking bettors about the likelihood of Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz, which is currently trading at 49% down from 52% . Market Movements: BTC : Bitcoin rebounded to $101,419 after a volatile 4.5% intraday swing, finding strong support at $99,000 amid geopolitical tensions and surging institutional buying interest, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data. ETH: Ethereum fell 2.3% to $2,237 amid U.S.-Iran tensions, breaking a six-week consolidation pattern despite over $500 million in institutional accumulation. Gold: Bank of America analysts predict gold could hit $4,000 an ounce within a year, an 18% jump, driven less by geopolitical tensions and more by mounting U.S. fiscal debt and a global shift by central banks away from the dollar toward gold. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets fell Monday as the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites fueled oil price spikes and fears of broader Middle East escalation, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 0.56%.

The Wyoming Stable Token Commission (WYST) is a proposed virtual currency representative of and redeemable for one US dollar held in a trust by the state of Wyoming. In a post on the social media platform X, Aptos says that the state is looking to use either chain with Layer Zero infrastructure to deploy a potential stablecoin. “The Wyoming Stable Token Commission has placed Aptos as the highest-scoring blockchain candidate for WYST – the first fiat-backed stablecoin issued by a US State – tying for 1st place with Solana. WYST will be deployed using Layer Zero… Aptos is making borderless, always-on finance a reality today with three native USD stablecoins & $30 billion+ in monthly stablecoin volume, supported by sub-second finality and near-zero transaction fees at [around] $0.00055. Following the recent passing of the GENIUS Act to establish the first regulatory framework for stablecoins and Aptos pushing further as the chain for stablecoins, the future of finance is here on Aptos.” Last year, Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon said he would push for the adoption of a “transparent” stablecoin fully backed by the state’s short-term Treasury holdings. “One of the big things for me is to be able to bring back onshore a lot of our debt because if it’s bought by treasuries and supported by Treasurys, it will help to stabilize that market to a degree… [What] is clear to me is that digital assets are going to have a future.

2025-06-22T22:00:48,"Successful Audit and Holders Hype Might Make Ruvi AI (RUVI) The Next $1 Project, Can It Mimic Bitcoin’s (BTC) Rise?","Bitcoin (BTC) has long been the benchmark of success in the cryptocurrency space, soaring from under $1 to tens of thousands of dollars over its history. But today, analysts are turning their gaze toward Ruvi AI (RUVI) , a rising crypto powered by blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) . With a structured growth model and a fast-growing community, Ruvi AI is inching closer to becoming the next $1 project. Could it replicate Bitcoin’s meteoric rise? Why Ruvi AI Is Emerging as a $1 Contender While Bitcoin built its empire on its scarcity and decentralized technology, Ruvi AI offers pragmatic utility by solving pressing challenges in marketing , entertainment , and finance.

Once the presale ends, the token’s price will increase to $0.07 , representing an almost 5x ROI before public trading begins. Analysts project that RUVI could go further, reaching $1 post-listing , a 66x ROI for those who invest early. This calculated growth puts Ruvi AI ahead of its competitors in terms of predictability and potential returns.

Key measurable highlights include: Over $1.9 million raised so far More than 160 million tokens sold , showing strong demand Over 1,600 token holders , underscoring a solid and growing community Importantly, the post-presale valuation of $0.07 is not speculative hype but rather a part of Ruvi AI’s structured pricing strategy.

2025-06-22T21:45:55,"Coinbase CEO Says the World Needs Crypto Now More Than Ever","Coinbase, a leading digital currency platform, has made a strong statement about the future of global finance. The company believes crypto can help solve key problems in today’s financial system, such as rising debt, inflation, and growing distrust in banks. According to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, digital currencies like Bitcoin (BTC) are not just new forms of money. They are tools that can help build a stronger, fairer economy. Global Debt and Inflation Are Rising In a post on X, the Coinbase CEO highlighted serious problems in the global economy. Government debt is rising quickly, especially in the U.S., where the national debt has now reached over $36 trillion. At the same time, inflation makes money worth less and everyday costs higher. This makes it harder for people to save, invest, or plan. Armstrong said these issues are reducing economic freedom and trust in banks. Bitcoin and Digital Currencies Offer a New Option In response to these problems, more people are turning to digital assets like Bitcoin. Coinbase CEO says the rising price of the flagship crypto shows that people are looking for safer alternatives. These assets are becoming a place to protect wealth from inflation and government overspending. Unlike traditional money, crypto can be sent quickly and cheaply across borders. It does not rely on central banks or large financial firms. This gives people more control over their money, especially in places with weak banking systems or unstable currencies. Many crypto leaders have also suggested using Bitcoin to reduce the U.S. national debt. In February, a new report from VanEck, an investment management firm, shed light on whether this plan is feasible . Crypto Is Not Just About Investment The Coinbase leader explained that crypto is more than a way to make money. It is a technology that can improve the financial system. It can speed up payments, lower fees, and support new business ways. Artists and creators can earn income directly from their audience without giving a significant share to middlemen. Armstrong said Coinbase is building new tools to make this possible. These include simple business payment systems and a crypto card that rewards users in Bitcoin . Coinbase aims to make crypto valuable in everyday life, not just as an investment but as a practical solution for modern finance. Coinbase is Building A New Foundation for the Financial System According to Coinbase, the world needs to rebuild its financial system from the ground up. The company believes crypto can be the foundation for this change. Under the leadership of its CEO, Coinbase is expanding its role from a trading platform to a complete financial services provider. It now supports various digital tools and wants to help build the next generation of internet-based financial systems.

2025-06-22T21:26:07,"Long-Awaited Good News for Bitcoin Comes from Texas","Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed into law Bill SB 21, adding Bitcoin reserves to the state’s legal framework. With this move, Texas has become the third state in the US to create an official Bitcoin reserve. According to the Bitcoin Laws platform, which tracks digital asset laws, 47 strategic Bitcoin reserve bills have been introduced in 26 states so far, with 13 bills under active consideration at the federal level. This growing interest in digital asset reserves across the country parallels the policies of Donald Trump, who was re-elected in November 2024. Trump, who took office in January, has taken extensive steps to transform the U.S. into a more crypto-friendly environment, including reversing anti-crypto banking practices (debanking), appointing pro-crypto figures to key regulatory positions, and establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Related News: Developers Sent a Large Amount of Tokens to Binance in This Altcoin - They Have Done This 11 Times in the Past, Here's What to Expect Trump signed an executive order on March 7, 2025, titled “Establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile,” formalizing the idea of a Bitcoin-only reserve. The order also defined a “Digital Asset Stockpile,” which would include other digital assets such as XRP, SOL, and ADA.

Following this event, Texas officially became the third US State to own a Bitcoin reserve fund under five months of the pro-crypto Donald Trump administration. Texas To Run Treasury-Independent Bitcoin Reserve On June 20, Texas State Governor Gregg Abbot officially enacted SB 21 , which proposed the formation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the purpose of investing in the digital asset market. The bill, now law and authored by Senator Charles Schwertner states the proposed Bitcoin reserve is to exist outside the state treasury but still under the investment authority of the comptroller of public accounts. Furthermore, the reserve is allowed to hold Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as dictated by the comptroller. However, only cryptocurrencies with an average market capitalization of $500 billion over a 12-month period can be logged into the reserve effectively limiting entry to Bitcoin ($2.07 trillion) and perhaps Ethereum ($272.3 billion) in the coming years. Meanwhile, all investments of the reserve into the state treasury requires authorization by the legislature via the general appropriations act or another law. However, the comptroller is allowed to withdraw Bitcoin or spend the net proceeds from asset sales to cover all costs involved in managing the reserve. Alongside SB 21, Governor Abbott also signed HB 4488 , a separate bill that prevents the strategic Bitcoin reserve and other certain state funds from undergoing a periodic treasury fund sweep while ensuring the reserve’s legal existence even if no Bitcoin has been purchased by summer 2026. The State Bitcoin Reserve Race On March 6, US President Donald Trump signed a federal strategic Bitcoin reserve into law encouraging states to explore the premier cryptocurrency as an investment tool. As earlier stated, Texas is the third US state now operating a strategic Bitcoin reserve after Arizona and New Hampshire. According to data from Bitcoin Laws , there are currently five other states looking to join the pack with a proposed legislative bill still under review. These states include Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, Rhodes Island, and Massachusetts.Meanwhile, efforts in states like Oklahoma, Florida, and Georgia, among others, have faced significant setbacks, with proposed Bitcoin reserve bills either stalled or formally repealed due to legislative or political roadblocks. At press time, Bitcoin continues to trade at $102,650 following a 2.74% decline in the past week.

2025-06-22T20:52:38,"Bitcoin Price Warnings Emerge, Stablecoins Score Regulatory Win: Binance Weekly Report","This week, the cryptocurrency space recorded a major win in the stablecoin sector despite geopolitical headwinds keeping markets in a risk-off stance. However, bitcoin (BTC) continued to consolidate until Friday before it plummeted due to tensions between Israel and Iran. A weekly report by the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, revealed that global markets have faced heightened volatility since the beginning of the week. The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady, but investors sold off their risk assets, including BTC and equities, as they sought safety. Bitcoin Consolidates Bitcoin and equities started the week with a rally, shrugging off the negative sentiment brought by geopolitical headlines. By mid-week, BTC retraced its steps and fell to $103,500, and investors moved to defensive assets as fears of a deeper Middle East geopolitical spillover resurfaced. The flight-to-safety trend was not just witnessed in bitcoin; ether and other large-cap altcoins saw similar moves. While investors moved from a risk-on to risk-off approach, Binance analysts found that structural demand for BTC remained resilient. The United States spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) market saw inflows totaling $2.4 billion across an eight-day streak that extended till June 18. The exchange said this was a sign of “dip-buying” by long-term investors. Spot Ethereum ETFs also saw notable positive flows, surpassing $605 million during the same period. In addition, on-chain metrics for Ethereum remained positive, with staked ether (ETH) surging to a record 34.9 million ETH, accounting for roughly 28.9% of the circulating supply. Analysts discovered that more than 500,000 ETH of the staked amount was added in the first two weeks of June. “This points to rising conviction in ETH’s yield potential and network security while further reducing liquid supply,” Binance stated. U.S. Senate Passes Stablecoin Bill On the regulatory front, the U.S. Senate passed the landmark Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act in a 68–30 vote on June 17. The bill is the first comprehensive regulatory framework for fully-reserved, anti-money laundering (AML)-compliant stablecoins. The next step for the GENIUS Act is to pass the House of Representatives before it can become law. Although the bill marks a major step forward for stablecoin regulation, it has raised concerns about the concentration of risk within the traditional banking system. This is because the Act mandates that stablecoin reserves be held by only federally regulated entities. Meanwhile, the policy win comes as stablecoin usage reaches record highs: the total supply has grown 22.5% since 2024 ended to exceed $250 billion, and on-chain transfer volumes have surpassed $20 trillion.

2025-06-22T20:39:55,"Best Crypto to Invest In As Whale Wallets Buy The World War III Fear","Global markets are sliding under the weight of conflict, with the United States now striking Iranian nuclear complexes while fighting spreads across the Middle East. Oil jumps and equities retreat in predictable lockstep, yet crypto moves with massive volatility. However, giant wallets that already command thousands of coins continue to absorb supply without pause. On-chain dashboards record week after week of inflows, highlighting purposeful accumulation rather than reflex trading. That quiet conviction is catching attention on retail message boards, where disbelief is giving way to curiosity. Many smaller traders now wonder whether disciplined buying by deep pockets is sketching the timeline for the next rally in both spot and derivatives venues, even while stocks bleed across benchmarks globally. Whales Double Down While War Intensifies Globally Look first at the wallets that set the tone. Michael Saylor, whose MicroStrategy pile rivals the treasuries of small nations, tweeted that fresh coins will reach the corporate vault on Monday, extending a buying streak that has barely paused all year. If the order executes at recent prices, the firm will cross the line of one point one percent of all Bitcoin ever to circulate. pic.twitter.com/wu9mMkxtUg — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 21, 2025 Saylor frames each purchase as insurance against sovereign muddles, and the weekend events lend weight to that view. Former President Donald Trump confirmed strikes on the Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan nuclear sites, a confrontation that rocked commodity charts but left Bitcoin liquidity deep and calm. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has been correcting and has seen a drop to the lower $101,000 levels, but then again, the buying activity from top investors globally seems to paint a different picture on the macro level. 🇸🇻 Update: El Salvador has boosted its Bitcoin stash by 8 BTC this week, pushing its total reserves to 6,215 BTC. pic.twitter.com/5hFTxa6UR6 — Crypto Jessica (@CryptoJessXBT) June 22, 2025 El Salvador chose the same moment to add eight more coins, lifting the national hoard to 6,215. The country’s average entry price now sits in the green, a detail officials celebrated by posting a profit tracker on social media. Institutional desks are reading the tape in similar fashion across major trading hubs worldwide. Trump Media filed for a fund that would hold Bitcoin and Ether, joining a queue of issuers now stretching out the door. Bloomberg data shows approval odds above 90% , and betting markets give Solana an even stronger shot at a green light before year-end. Seven managers have revised their Solana filings to include staking rewards, signalling an arms race to capture yield-hungry flows. As regulators inch toward clarity, heavy wallets treat volatility as a clearance sale rather than a threat. Naturally, these developments have created a sense of interest and intrigue among smaller investors now as well, who now speculate the crypto space to see another major rally once the war situation settles a bit and the purchases made by these top institutional buyers start to turn profitable. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Coins that Could Pump As Bitcoin Recovers BTC Bull BTC Bull is designed to turn every major Bitcoin milestone into a celebration for its holders. As the first official meme coin built entirely around Bitcoin’s rise, it goes far beyond the usual hype. It’s a structured reward engine built on Ethereum. Every time Bitcoin crosses a $25,000 price increment, BTC Bull triggers either a token burn or a BTC airdrop. When Bitcoin climbed from $75,000 to $100,000, a massive burn event permanently removed a portion of the $BTCBULL supply, tightening scarcity and energizing demand. The next milestone, $125,000, is already circled by the community. But the real prize lies at $250,000. A massive airdrop of actual Bitcoin awaits holders, weighted by both their token balance and the size of their Community Sale purchase. This means the earlier you joined and the more you held, the bigger your reward when Bitcoin hits that level. Smaller milestone rewards have already begun, with airdrops in wrapped BTC sent to loyal wallets every time the market breaks higher. Jacob Crypto Bury speculates BTCBULL to be a 100x crypto once it launches, which also adds to its growing popularity and demand further. Beyond the milestone mechanics, BTC Bull also features a secure staking contract with high APY options for those who want to lock in their tokens. While others chase volatility, stakers here quietly collect ongoing rewards with every block. The meme coin aspect draws attention, but underneath it is a model engineered for serious engagement. It’s a project that ties its entire incentive system to Bitcoin’s trajectory, offering utility that doesn’t just ride popularity, but mirrors Bitcoin’s actual momentum, one milestone at a time. SUBBD SUBBD rewrites how creators earn and how fans pay by moving the entire subscription loop onto a permissionless rail. Instead of laboring under card processors that take ten percent and settle weeks later, artists set a price in SUBBD, upload work, and watch the contract release funds in real time once content is unlocked. Video, audio, image, or text, every entry lives in decentralized storage with an access key issued only after a signed transaction. Because the escrow is autonomous, there are no chargebacks or surprise fees. That reliability has drawn established influencers who were losing income to fraud and geographical bank limits. Platform revenue arrives continuously rather than at the end of a pay cycle, which smooths cash flow and allows creators to plan production schedules with confidence. The token earns utility on both sides of the table. Fans who stake SUBBD receive loyalty boosts that lower future subscription costs and unlock exclusive polls or community calls. Meanwhile, part of every transaction fee routes to a buy and burn vault, compressing float as daily activity climbs. Network burn rate already outpaces new token emissions, which has turned the asset into a deflationary ticket. This architecture matters during wartime volatility because payment processors often suspend regions, yet the SUBBD rail remains open so global audiences stay connected to their favorite voices. With privacy, instant settlement, and a shrinking supply all built in, the project presents a secure, resilient gateway for content economies that need income certainty when wider markets wobble. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper introduces a Layer 2 experience for Bitcoin by stitching the asset to a Solana Virtual Machine environment that carries throughput in the thousands of transactions per second. The bridge starts on the base chain where a canonical address collects deposits. Relay contracts then confirm block headers and transactions in cryptographic proofs. When verification clears, wrapped BTC appears inside the Hyper ledger with finality measured in seconds and fees that sit comfortably below one cent. Transaction data does not bloat the network. Instead, an aggregator condenses blocks into concise bundles, generates a zero-knowledge proof, and posts the result back to Bitcoin for settlement. Security remains anchored to proof of work while performance rivals the fastest smart contract networks. Because the bridge is trustless, traders can enter and exit without surrendering custody. The HYPER token energizes every layer of the system. Holders stake to earn up to 509% APY during the ongoing presale, a rate funded by an allocation that reserves 15% of supply for community incentives. Additional slices distribute as 30% for development, 25% for the treasury, 20% for marketing, and 10% for exchange liquidity. Early demand is clear, with more than $1.5 million collected to date. By bringing cost-efficient settlement, rapid execution, and compatibility with Solana tooling, Bitcoin Hyper converts Bitcoin from a passive store of value into a platform ready for decentralized finance, gaming, and daily payments. Investors looking for infrastructure that tracks Bitcoin growth while adding real utility may find the proposition compelling. Best Wallet Token Best Wallet Token is not just a governance asset but a native fuel for one of the most ambitious self-custody rollouts in the retail crypto space. Built around a non-custodial wallet with deep integrations into swaps, dApps, and cross-chain analytics, the token plays a central role in user onboarding and platform activity. Holders receive perks such as zero-fee swaps, priority access to new token listings, and rebates in the form of BEST every time they perform wallet actions like bridging or staking. This encourages engagement and builds velocity in the ecosystem, particularly useful during times of heightened volatility when users demand direct control over their funds. In the current market, where exchanges can freeze assets due to regulatory shifts or political events, a secure and feature-rich wallet becomes critical infrastructure. Best Wallet leans into that by offering not just basic storage but real-time insights into on-chain activity and wallet-to-wallet alerts that notify users when major transactions occur from flagged or high-net-worth addresses. This layer of intelligence turns the wallet into a trading terminal, not just a vault. A percentage of all platform fees goes toward scheduled token burns, which have so far removed millions of BEST from circulation. With a deflationary supply, ongoing utility, and increasing wallet downloads since Q2, the token is gaining traction both as a store of platform value and a real-time reward instrument. As more institutional buyers turn to on-chain tools during uncertain times, BEST sits at the intersection of functionality, transparency, and adaptive rewards. Conclusion In a market defined by fear, the smartest capital is still buying. Whale wallets, corporate treasuries, and nation-state portfolios are moving with intent, not hesitation. That kind of activity is rarely casual. It signals a belief that the current chaos is not the end of a cycle but the beginning of a new phase. And while headlines may rattle weaker hands, the chain tells a clearer story—capital is positioning for something larger. For investors watching from the sidelines, this may be the time to look closer at assets designed not just to ride the next rally, but to benefit directly from the mechanics driving it. Some of them are already rewarding those who act early. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

2025-06-22T20:15:30,"Garden Finance Accused of Aiding $1.4B Crypto Laundering Scheme","Blockchain researcher ZachXBT has accused Garden Finance of helping to launder funds stolen in the massive $1.4 billion Bybit hack. The decentralized crypto swapping platform recently reported strong growth numbers. However, critics believe much of that activity may involve suspicious or criminal transactions. Garden Reports Busy Activity in Q2 2025 In its Q2 2025 report, Garden Finance shared data from Dune Analytics showing high transaction activity. The platform handled nearly 24,984 Bitcoin (BTC) in swaps, worth over $1.5 billion, across 40,571 atomic swaps. It also earned 40.11 BTC in fees, with one manual swap reaching a volume of 10 BTC. While these numbers were meant to highlight success, they quickly drew criticism. ZachXBT questioned the source of these high volumes and fees. He claimed over 80% of the platform’s earnings may have come from laundering stolen assets. He said Chinese agents linked to the North Korean Lazarus Group used Garden Finance to move the stolen funds. Garden Finance Response Stirred Controversy In response, Garden Finance executive Jax Gulati pointed to a past update from Q4 2024. He said the platform held only 30 BTC at the time of the Bybit hack and denied that it was centralized or pretending to be decentralized. Nevertheless, ZachXBT was not convinced. He mentioned other hacks, like the one on WazirX, to show a pattern. He claimed the same group kept using Garden Finance, raising concerns about who uses the platform and how it is being monitored. Further fueling the debate, a user named James Scaur commented on the nature of liquidity flow on Garden Finance. He said the reason one user seemed to control most of the liquidity could be explained by a Pareto distribution, which often happens in financial systems. According to him, this did not mean the platform was centralized. However, ZachXBT disagreed. He said one user had been making large swaps since the limit was raised to 10 cbBTC. He claimed this person added cbBTC through Coinbase and moved money linked to the Bybit hack. By April 2025, ZachXBT said most of the swaps on the platform were connected to this same group, which made the suspicious activity easier to spot. He questioned why the team at Garden Finance had not acted sooner. Garden Finance Allegedly Profits From Illegal Transactions ZachXBT accused Garden Finance of profiting from these illegal transactions. He said the team should return the fees earned from such swaps and shut down large transaction features. This has caused a big debate in the decentralized finance (DeFi). Similarly, Bybit asked ParaSwap DAO to return over $90,000 in ETH paid by a hacker in swap fees. He also claimed that part of the revenue was used in earlier airdrop farming, a strategy some use to unfairly benefit from new token releases.

2025-06-22T20:00:33,"‘Bond King’ Jeffrey Gundlach Warns Trend of US Outperformance Over ‘For Real,’ Says Investors in One Region Printing Money Right Now","DoubleLine Capital CEO Jeffrey Gundlach says that the trend of American exceptionalism has come to an abrupt end. In a new CNBC interview, the billionaire “Bond King” says that foreign investors have been happily investing in US assets over the last two decades, leading to massive capital inflows to the tune of tens of trillions of dollars. But now, Gundlach says he’s seeing signs that foreign investors are yanking capital out of US markets in favor of the euro and European equities. According to the hedge fund chief executive, the reversal in flows tells him that investors are now crowning a new market leader. “Foreigners have been very willing – downright enthusiastic, almost euphoric – about buying dollar assets over the past 18 years or so. Over $25 trillion has been invested in US financial markets, more than the US has invested in foreign markets. That’s a massive increase. It went from $3 trillion to $28 trillion by one measure. That may be reversing, and this is part of the underpinning for why I think that the trend of US outperformance is over. And I mean over for real… I’ve been recommending Europe in European currency for dollar-based investors. The [European] index has outperformed the US index by a decent amount, but if you had the currency side of it, if you own it in euros and you get the currency translation, you are just printing money right now.

2025-06-22T19:49:09,"Major Development Occurs for Bankrupt Cryptocurrency Exchange FTX","FTX Recovery Trust, which is managing the liquidation process of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, has filed a formal 94-page objection in the US Delaware bankruptcy court seeking to completely dismiss the over $1.5 billion claim by failed hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC). The appeal states that 3AC’s claim is “unrealistic, unsupportable, and based on an erroneous assumption regarding the account balance.” FTX argues that 3AC overstates the value of its digital assets. 3AC’s claim is based on FTX’s alleged holding of approximately $1.6 billion worth of digital assets on the platform when it went bankrupt in November 2022. However, as of June 2022, that account was worth only $284 million, including margin debt of more than $733 million, according to FTX’s statement. Related News: Bitcoin Price Below $100,000: Research Firm's Head of Research Reveals Next Support Level FTX alleged that 3AC ignored the debt burden and attempted to make its overly leveraged positions appear as “clean value.” According to the filing, most of that $284 million in assets disappeared in just two days. $222 million was wiped out by the crypto market crash, while $60 million was withdrawn by 3AC itself. FTX said they only liquidated one $82 million position after 3AC exceeded limits by not responding to margin calls. It claims this action was in accordance with the contract and “prevented a negative account balance.” The petition stated: “FTX creditors should not be insured against 3AC’s failed trades. The hedge fund took risky positions and messed it up. FTX took action as those positions collapsed.” If the court rules in FTX’s favor, 3AC’s claim could be dismissed entirely or significantly reduced to just ordinary creditor status, meaning the fund would only receive a small portion of the amount it is seeking. The next hearing will be held on August 12. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-22T19:22:00,"3 Best XRP Alternatives That Could 20-50x Your Portfolio In The Second Half Of 2025","The crypto market never sleeps; it evolves. While XRP remains a heavyweight in digital payments, forward-thinking investors are scanning the horizon for the next big opportunities. With cross-border transactions expected to balloon past $250 trillion within two years, fresh solutions are emerging that could leave even established players in the dust. Three projects – SUI, HYPE, and Remittix – are turning heads, each carving out distinct niches that might just deliver life-changing returns. What makes these alternatives special? They’re not just chasing XRP’s tail. Instead, they’re solving real problems in ways that could redefine entire sectors. As we approach mid-2025, these contenders offer exposure to growth vectors XRP simply can’t match, especially in the exploding PayFi space. SUI Network: Where Web3 meets Wall Street SUI isn’t just another blockchain, but Web3 built for scale. While XRP courts banks, SUI is rewriting the rulebook for decentralized applications. Recent moves have traders buzzing: a liquidity-boosting alliance between Momentum, Wormhole, and OKX has set the stage for what could be a major price surge. (ChatGPT’s bullish forecast didn’t hurt either.) Source: CoinGecko Here’s the kicker—SUI’s architecture solves the “blockchain trilemma” better than most. Fast transactions? Check. Ironclad security? You bet. And unlike XRP’s narrow focus, SUI plays well across DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise solutions. As institutions warm to Web3, this could be the infrastructure play that delivers triple-digit gains. Could HYPE ride Bitcoin’s coattails to the moon? Ever wish you’d bought Bitcoin in 2012? HYPE might be the next best thing. Whispers of massive BTC holdings by 2027 have speculators salivating. While XRP fights regulatory battles, HYPE is positioning itself as the institutional darling, labelled the “safe” crypto bet for Wall Street money. Source: CoinMarketCap The numbers tell the story: a projected $109 billion holding shift could send shockwaves through the market. Sure, it’s speculative. But remember, every crypto giant was once an underdog. HYPE’s secret sauce? It’s not trying to replace traditional finance like XRP. Instead, it’s becoming the bridge big money can’t ignore. Remittix: The silent killer of cross-border payments Let’s be honest, wire transfers are still stuck in the Stone Age. Remittix changes everything. Imagine sending crypto that lands as fiat in any bank account, with the recipient none the wiser. That’s not the future, either; it’s happening now across 40+ cryptocurrencies. While XRP battles SWIFT, Remittix sidesteps the fight entirely. Its Pay API lets businesses accept crypto while getting paid in dollars, with no volatility headaches. The real genius? Merchant accounts with 30+ fiat and 50+ crypto pairs. This isn’t just another payment rail—it’s the missing link between crypto’s speed and traditional finance’s reach. The presale is no slouch either, and tokens are flying off the shelves. Over $15.8 million has been raised to date, and with an entry price of $0.0781, early birds are locking on to this project en masse. Which XRP alternative works out best? XRP had its moment. SUI offers the tech stack for Web3’s next chapter. HYPE could be institutional money’s backdoor into crypto. But Remittix ? It’s solving the trillion-dollar pain point nobody else has cracked. The presale window won’t stay open forever. For investors who spotted Ethereum’s potential in 2016 or Solana’s in 2020, this feels eerily familiar. The question isn’t whether these alternatives will grow—it’s which one will leave XRP looking like yesterday’s news.

2025-06-22T19:05:47,"Bitcoin fell to $98K after Iran moved to shut the Strait of Hormuz","Bitcoin dropped under $99,000 on Sunday after Iran moved to close the Strait of Hormuz, cutting off one of the world’s main oil transport routes. The decision followed U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, escalating an already tense situation. The impact was immediate. Ethereum collapsed by 10%, trading at $2,180, while XRP slid by 8%, landing at $1.93. The total market reacted with sharp volume spikes, liquidations, and uncertainty that’s not going away anytime soon. The Strait of Hormuz, which sits between Iran and Oman, handles a quarter of global oil exports. Iran’s parliament, reacting to the U.S. military action, backed a proposal to block the channel. Source: Axios The parliament doesn’t control the Strait, that power belongs to the military and security forces, but the threat was still enough to shake global markets. ClearView Energy Partners warned that oil prices could open “meaningfully above” the $77.01 per barrel Friday close unless the U.S. and its allies make diplomatic moves. Crypto tanks across the board as Iran stirs oil chaos According to Reuters, the shutdown announcement came after the U.S. bombed several of Iran’s nuclear sites, triggering one of the strongest reactions yet in the long-running standoff between Iran and Israel . If this plays out, it’ll be the first time the conflict actually affects global oil flows. The crypto market took it hard. In the last 24 hours alone, Bitcoin saw $47.7 billion in volume as traders moved fast. The coin is now down 6.3% this week, with its market cap at $1.96 trillion. Ethereum, which was already struggling, is now down 14.3% over 7 days, with $29.5 billion in daily volume. XRP, hit by both the geopolitical shock and its usual regulatory baggage, is down 10.7% on the week with a $114 billion market cap. Solana, sitting at $128.65, fell 6.4%, dragging its weekly losses to nearly 15%. BNB didn’t escape either, shedding 3.9%, down to $608. Only Tether held firm to its dollar peg at $1.00, with over $76 billion in 24-hour trade. Even with no actual movement to seal off the channel yet, analysts aren’t brushing this off. Eurasia Group said Sunday that Iran likely won’t fully close Hormuz, but they expect “increased harassment of tanker traffic” in the coming days. That alone is enough to cause oil panic — and oil panic is now crypto panic. Arthur Hayes, economist and crypto veteran, reacted with one line: “Do you hear that? … it’s the sound of the money printers revving up to do their patriotic duty. This weakness shall pass and $BTC will leave no doubt as to its safe haven status.” U.S. officials call the move suicidal, warn of military response Despite the panic, the authority to block Hormuz isn’t up to Iran’s parliament. Security decisions go through the Revolutionary Guard, which hasn’t yet acted. Still, the threat alone has put pressure on Washington and raised the risk of a military showdown. Eurasia analyst Gregory Brew said that closing the Strait “would be an effective declaration of war against the Gulf states and the US.” He also noted that Iran, already weakened economically, is “unlikely to seek escalation of that kind at this time.” But there’s still tension. The U.S. has deployed major forces to the Gulf region, and any move from Iran could lead to an armed response. For crypto investors, that’s not a good sign. As long as oil routes are in danger, markets won’t stabilize. Crypto isn’t disconnected anymore. It’s tied directly to global energy routes. U.S. Vice President JD Vance also weighed in during an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press . “Their entire economy runs through the Strait of Hormuz. If they want to destroy their own economy and cause disruptions in the world, I think that would be their decision,” he said. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s fall is the worst it’s seen this quarter, and Bitcoin’s slip below $100K wipes out weeks of gains. XRP, already on shaky ground due to legal fights in the U.S., is now down 6% in a day, with a full 10.7% loss over 7 days. Market caps are crumbling, and the fear is showing in trade volume spikes. Right now, the only certainty is that nothing is certain. Crypto, oil, and geopolitics are locked in the same room, and Iran just turned off the lights.

2025-06-22T19:00:25,"$96k Or $144k? Bitcoin Mayer Multiple Chart Price Target Options","Bitcoin (BTC) has registered a slight uptick in the last few hours after US President Donald Trump announced a successful airstrike on Iranian nuclear facilities, a move aimed at de-escalating rising tensions in the Middle East after several days of conflict between Iran and Israel. Despite the short-term price reaction, BTC remains in a corrective phase, having struggled to break through the $110,000 resistance level over the past month with market sentiment being largely shaped by both global uncertainty and technical stagnation. Amid this backdrop, a crypto analyst with X pseudonym On-Chain College has highlighted two prospective price targets based on on-chain data. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Breakdown Spurs Sell-Offs, Analyst Reveals What Will Happen If BTC Hits 92,800 Market Odds Favor Further Upside For Bitcoin – Analyst In a recent X post on June 21, On-Chain College shares a positive long-term Bitcoin price outlook using the Mayer Multiple, an on-chain metric that measures relationship between Bitcoin’s price and its 200-day moving average (200DMA). By tracking key valuation bands, the Mayer Multiple helps determine whether Bitcoin is overvalued, undervalued, or fairly valued, based on historical price behavior. Since the bull market commenced in Q4 2024, Bitcoin has consistently moved between 1.0x band i.e. the 200DMA (blue line) and the 1.5x band (orange line) representing the mid price range zone. Notably, the Bitcoin price struggles in the past have generated speculations of potential market top at the current market high. However, the Mayer Multiple chart shows that BTC has only ever attained a cycle price peak after hitting the 2.5x band (red line). Therefore, there is still room for price growth in the current bull market. However, the immediate price targets for premier cryptocurrency lies at $96,000 (1.0x) or $144,000 (1.5x). Notably, there is significant potential to rediscover its bullish form and surge towards $144,000 in line with its defined-range bound movement. However, there are also equal chances of a return to $96,000 which On-Chain College states would aid in flushing out weak hands before a full-scale bullish price reversal. Related Reading: XRP Daily New Addresses Plunge 80% In 2025 — Bearish On-Chain Metrics Raise Alarm Bitcoin Price Outlook At the time of writing, Bitcoin is valued at $102,700 following a 1.50% decline in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the maiden cryptocurrency also reports losses of 2.94% and 8.08% on the weekly and monthly chart, respectively. According to CoinCodex, the general market sentiment remains neutral. However, CoinCodex analysts foresee an impending price breakout with an audacious projection of $136,472 within the next five days. Interestingly, it’s worth noting that this level may represent or come close to the cycle market top, as long-term forecasts include $138,379 in three months and $116,115 in six months.

2025-06-22T18:47:57,"Texas Establishes State-Run Bitcoin Reserve with Passage of SB21","Texas Governor Greg Abbott has officially signed Senate Bill 21 (SB21), creating the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a state-operated fund that will hold Bitcoin as a long-term financial asset. The move makes Texas the first U.S. state to not only legalize a Bitcoin reserve but also to directly allocate public funds toward building digital asset holdings. Unlike traditional state investments, the reserve will function outside Texas’ general treasury, serving as a hedge against inflation and a new tool to bolster the state’s financial resilience. Strict Criteria Ensures Bitcoin-Only Holdings According to the bill, only assets with a market capitalization exceeding $500 billion are eligible for inclusion in the fund. Currently, Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency meeting that requirement. The Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts will manage the fund with guidance from a three-member advisory board composed of cryptocurrency investment experts. Reserve Can Grow Through Airdrops and Donations The legislation allows for the Bitcoin reserve to expand through various mechanisms beyond direct purchases. These include blockchain forks, investment gains, and even airdrops or public donations. A transparency provision mandates that a comprehensive report on the fund’s holdings and performance be published every two years. Legal Protections Cement Reserve Independence The passage of SB21 follows the earlier signing of House Bill 4488, which protects the reserve from being transferred into the general revenue fund. This measure ensures the fund remains insulated from broader budgetary shifts and fiscal pressures. Texas now joins Arizona and New Hampshire as the third U.S. state to approve a Bitcoin reserve policy. However, Texas is unique in that it is the first to use state funds and establish an independent structure for its holdings. Corporate Adoption of Bitcoin Continues to Grow Public interest in Bitcoin reserves is being mirrored in the corporate world. Nakamoto Holdings, a Bitcoin investment firm founded by David Bailey, a crypto adviser to former President Donald Trump, recently raised $51.5 million through a PIPE (private investment in public equity) transaction to increase its Bitcoin portfolio. Meanwhile, France’s Blockchain Group has added 182 BTC worth approximately $19.6 million to its reserves, bringing its total to 1,653 BTC. Growing Institutional Demand Signals Enduring Bitcoin Interest Recent data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET shows that more organizations have begun holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset over the past month. This aligns with a broader trend pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which has been at the forefront of public company Bitcoin adoption.

The city of Spokane is banning crypto kiosks after the City Council voted unanimously to pass an ordinance that seeks to protect its residents against scams aided by digital asset ATMs. “This ordinance prohibits virtual currency kiosks from being operated in the City of Spokane. Spokane has seen a significant increase in scams arising from the use of cryptocurrency kiosks, and there has been a steady increase in victims losing thousands of dollars. This ordinance provides for a tool to protect consumers from those individuals who rely primarily on virtual currency to defraud others.” Crypto kiosks allow users to buy and transfer digital assets using cash, debit or credit cards. While the machines do not dispense any cash, they allow users to deposit crypto assets in their personal wallets or transfer the funds overseas. “Virtual currency kiosk transactions move quickly, and can occur anywhere and, because of the speed of the transaction, the majority of such transactions are irrevocable… In some cases, law enforcement are able to trace cryptocurrency transactions and ‘follow the money,’ however, many of the ‘scams’ or nefarious transactions transfer funds to destinations overseas, and U.S. law enforcement may encounter significant challenges in other jurisdictions.” Council member Paul Dillon says crypto kiosks have become the “preferred tool” of scammers looking to exploit unsuspecting individuals. “This ordinance will protect vulnerable Spokane residents from scams involving virtual currency kiosks, and I am proud we are the first city in the state to move this legislation forward.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
