2025-06-23T04:47:48,"Bitcoin Holds Key Support; Oil Disappoints 'Doomers' as Brent and WTI Erase Early Price Gains","American poet Charles Bukowski famously said: ""The crowd is always wrong,"" and his words seem to sum up the situation in the financial markets perfectly. Just 24 hours ago, social media was abuzz with fears that the U.S. airstrike on Iran's nuclear sites, combined with the talk of Iran mulling the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, will trigger a massive surge in oil prices, leading to a slide in stocks and cryptocurrencies. The reality, however, has turned out to be different. Oil prices on both sides of the Atlantic gapped higher by just 3% and have since erased most of the gains, according to data source TradingView. As of writing, a barrel of Brent oil changed hands at $77, up just 1.4% for the day. Prices gapped higher to hit a five-month high of $77.79. Similarly, the West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) hit a high of $78.58 before falling back to $76.75. Meanwhile, bitcoin BTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has risen back above $101,000, having hit lows under $98,000 on Sunday when fears of an oil price spike led to the short-term Deribit-listed BTC puts trading at an 8%-10% volatility premium to calls. Futures tied to the S&P 500 traded just 0.3% lower. The largely muted reaction in oil prices suggests that the market doesn't expect Iran to follow through on its threats and block the Strait of Hormuz, which could destabilize its key allies in Asia, particularly China. ""Price action this morning suggests that the market doesn’t believe (at least not yet) that flows through Hormuz will be blocked. Brent is back below $80/bbl after briefly spiking above this level earlier in the trading session,"" analysts at ING said in a report to clients Monday. ""With more than 80% of oil flows through Hormuz ending up in Asia, the impact on the region would be larger than that on the US. Therefore, Iran would want to be careful in upsetting the likes of China by disrupting oil flows,"" ING added. According to energy market expert Anas Alhajji, Iran's threat to close the Strait is largely a rhetorical tactic for domestic consumption, which it has employed at least 15 times since the 1980s. Alhajji explained the same in a post on X , revisiting the 2018 thread that detailed how blocking the strait is easier said than done. ""For Iran to close the Strait, it means occupation and the taking over of Oman's waters where most ships go through. This will immediately invoke the defence pact of the GCC: it means war among all,"" the thread said, adding that a potential closure would hurt Iran's friends more than its enemies, which do not import oil from Iran and could circumvent the Strait through two underutilized pipelines. BTC holds key support All this means that the much-feared oil price spike may not materialize soon, which could help BTC and other risk assets avoid a sell-off. A big surge in oil would increase the risk of major economies slipping into stagflation, the worst outcome for most assets, including bitcoin. BTC's chart shows that bears failed to establish a foothold below the horizontal support at $100,430 on Sunday. Buyers stepped in around that level on June 5, taking prices higher to $110,000 in subsequent days. Oil's muted reaction suggests the potential for history to repeat itself. On the flip side, acceptance under the support would shift the focus to the confluence of the 100- and 200-day simple moving averages at around $95,900.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/23/bitcoin-holds-key-support-oil-disappoints-doomers-as-brent-and-wti-erase-early-price-gains,"ASIA|BTC|COMMODITY|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Oil|Markets|Iran|News",cryptocompare

The metric, which the firm uses as a key performance indicator, tracks Bitcoin per fully diluted share over time, excluding the effects of dilution. The firm also posted a BTC gain of 4,367 BTC for $451.2 million for the ongoing quarter, based on reference prices from Bitflyer. The company has funded its Bitcoin purchases through a series of capital market activities, including multiple zero-coupon bond issuances and equity-based instruments. Since January, Metaplanet has issued and redeemed more than a dozen series of ordinary bonds and stock acquisition rights, largely subscribed by EVO FUND . Over 210 million shares have been issued under its “210 Million Plan.” Metaplanet Wants to Buy 210,000 BTC by 2027 Often dubbed as Japan’s Strategy, the company aims to buy 210,000 Bitcoins by the end 2027. Between May and June 2025 alone, Metaplanet raised over $300 million through bonds and exercised stock rights, with proceeds explicitly allocated for Bitcoin accumulation. The company formalized Bitcoin Treasury Operations as a core business line in December 2024, a pivot from its hotel management business. Since then, it has disclosed regular updates on its BTC position, including total holdings, cost basis, and share dilution metrics. As of June 23, Metaplanet’s fully diluted share count stood at 759 million, with Bitcoin per 1,000 fully diluted shares reaching 0.0146 BTC. The company has not indicated a halt or slowdown in its Bitcoin acquisition strategy.

Why are other cryptos going down?” But the user wasn’t satisfied and said, “Since I bought Pi, it has been falling. I’ve seen 3 ups and 5 downs. I have no confidence in Pi anymore.

The firm, which manages 14,200 rental units and half a million square feet of A-grade office space, aims to diversify its holdings by integrating Bitcoin’s potential for long-term value growth with its real estate assets. Cardone highlighted its strategy’s ambition, stating plans to acquire an additional 3,000 BTC. The firm also eyes 5,000 rental units by the end of 2025.

2025-06-23T03:30:10,"Bitcoin Crashed Below $100,000 Amid US Airstrikes On Iran And Market Sell-Off","The market’s leading crypto, Bitcoin (BTC), dipped below the $100,000 mark for the first time in over a month on Sunday, following US airstrikes on Iran as conflicts in the middle east continue to escalate. This decline, which saw the Bitcoin price drop approximately 4% to around $99,300, coincided with a broader market sell-off, with Ethereum (ETH) experiencing an even sharper decline of nearly 10%. Overall, the total cryptocurrency market took a significant hit, falling about 7% in just 24 hours. Geopolitical Unrest And Tariff Troubles The timing of this downturn was particularly notable, occurring just hours after the US targeted three key nuclear sites in Iran. Tensions had escalated following a United Nations report that indicated Iran was not adhering to international prohibitions against developing a military nuclear program. In response to these revelations, Israel conducted strikes against Iran, leading to further retaliation from the Islamic Republic. On Saturday, President Donald Trump declared on social media: This is an HISTORIC MOMENT FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ISRAEL, AND THE WORLD. IRAN MUST NOW AGREE TO END THIS WAR. THANK YOU! Related Reading: Solana Cracks Below Key Structure – Head And Shoulders Breakdown Points To $106 This recent plummet below the psychologically significant $100,000 threshold follows a year of substantial gains for Bitcoin. After Trump took office in January, Bitcoin reached all-time highs above $100,000 in February, buoyed by executive orders aimed at supporting the cryptocurrency sector. However, the cryptocurrency’s price soon mirrored the broader declines in financial markets, particularly after Trump announced severe tariffs in April, which saw Bitcoin fall to nearly $75,000, its lowest point in 2025. Despite this volatility, Bitcoin had seen a resurgence, particularly in May when it reached new highs as Wall Street investors returned to the cryptocurrency through US exchange-traded funds (ETFs). However, by late Sunday, there were signs of recovery, with Bitcoin trading approximately at $101,300, down only 1% over the previous day, while ETH managed to pare its losses to around $2,200. Forced Liquidations Exacerbate Bitcoin Sell-Off According to CNBC, Iran has also threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial shipping route responsible for approximately 20% of the global oil supply, further adding to the broader financial uncertainty. JPMorgan warned that such a blockade could drive oil prices up to $130 per barrel, which would have significant implications for US inflation, potentially pushing it back toward 5%—a level not seen since March 2023. While Bitcoin has often been promoted as an inflation hedge, its recent behavior aligns more closely with that of high-beta tech stocks. Data from crypto provider Kaiko indicates that Bitcoin’s correlation with the tech-heavy Nasdaq has increased sharply in recent weeks, particularly following the surge in inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. Related Reading: $312M ETH Transfer Triggers Sell-Off Fears As Ethereum Price Crashes Below Support Institutional investment patterns have also shifted. More than $1.04 billion flowed into spot Bitcoin ETFs from Monday to Wednesday last week, but this momentum dissipated as the weekend approached, with minimal net movement on Thursday and only $6.4 million on Friday. The technical aspects of the market further exacerbated the sell-off. Research from CoinGlass revealed that Bitcoin’s drop below $99,000 triggered forced liquidations across offshore derivatives platforms, including Binance and Bybit. During this period, over $1 billion in crypto positions were liquidated within 24 hours, with more than 95% of these coming from long positions, highlighting the market’s overexposure.

2025-06-23T02:10:58,"Bitcoin dives, rebounds, then tanks again as ETF flows collapse","Markets went straight into meltdown mode Sunday night after the United States bombed Iran in a direct military strike and Iran retaliated by shutting down Strait of Hormuz, the most important oil route on the planet. That has triggered violent selloffs across every major market, from stocks to Bitcoin, from oil to the dollar and the euro. The world’s financial system is now reacting like it just got sucker punched. Its unlike anything we have ever seen. Oil was first to go wild. In the first trading session after the futures market opened, US crude rose $1.76, or 2.38%, to $75.60 per barrel. Brent crude climbed $1.80, or 2.34%, landing at $78.81. Brent even briefly touched $81, which was a 5.7% spike, before it slipped back. By press time, the price gains were gone. Oil was down 0.5%, which made no sense to anyone watching. Traders are now locked on Tehran, waiting to see what it does next. Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, Iran’s foreign minister, said Sunday that Iran reserves “ all options ” to defend its sovereignty. S&P Global Platts noted the price surge could reverse entirely if Iran chooses not to respond. Bitcoin dives, rebounds, then tanks again as ETF flows collapse The crypto market didn’t waste a second. Bitcoin had dropped to $98,000 on Sunday. That was its lowest point in over a month. Less than an hour later, it swung back above $102,000, before slipping again. At the time of writing, it sat at $100,879. The market was a disaster. More than $1 billion in crypto positions were liquidated in just 24 hours, and over 95% were long bets. Source: TradingView Things got uglier when inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs dried up. Between Monday and Wednesday, $1.04 billion had gone in, based on CoinGlass data. But by Thursday, that number was flat. On Friday, just $6.4 million came in. That was the same day President Donald Trump left the G7 early and announced a two-week review of US options on Iran. The assumption that Bitcoin would act like a safe haven collapsed. It started trading like a risky tech stock instead. Kaiko, a crypto data provider, said Bitcoin’s correlation with the Nasdaq had surged quite fast in recent weeks. Stock indexes bleed across Asia, Europe, and US futures Futures tied to US stocks also started dropping. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 109 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 futures lost 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.4%. Asian markets opened deep in the red too. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 dropped 0.56%, and the Topix fell 0.49%. The worst-hit companies were all in tech: Screen Holdings crashed 4.78%, Lasertec Corp sank 4.31%, and Disco Corp went down 3.38%. Big names like Advantest and Softbank didn’t escape either, falling 1.66% and 0.76%. It was the same story in South Korea. The Kospi index lost 1.05%. The Kosdaq, which includes smaller-cap companies, got hit even harder, down 1.78%. The country’s top automakers took the brunt. Hyundai Motor shares dropped 4.05%, and Kia Corp fell 4.15%. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 also took a dive, down 0.76%. In Hong Kong, futures for the Hang Seng Index pointed to more losses. They stood at 23,396, well below the index’s last close of 23,530.48, suggesting more downside ahead. Japanese carmakers had no luck either. As of press time, Nissan Motor dropped 2.22%, and Mazda Motor was down 2.17%. Mitsubishi Motors lost 1.87%, Honda Motor slid 1.55%, and Toyota dropped 1.36%. Over in Europe, markets weren’t much better. The IBEX 35 rose 0.77%, closing at 13,850.3, and Germany’s DAX jumped 1.27% to 23,350.55. But the FTSE in London dropped 0.2% to 8,774.65, and France’s CAC 40 was completely flat at 7,589.66. The STOXX600, a broader European index, barely moved, up just 0.13% to 536.53. And the euro was trading at $1.15 against the dollar after going as high as $1.8 just an hour ago.

2025-06-23T01:36:19,"Asia Morning Briefing: BTC Reclaims $100K as Markets Shrug off Iran Strike","Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins the trading week, bitcoin BTC is trading above $100,500 as the initial volatility from news over the weekend that the U.S. struck some of Iran's nuclear facilities begins to subside. While prices briefly dipped below six figures on Sunday in a risk-off reaction , markets have since stabilized. Equity futures are flat, and gold is up only marginally, suggesting that traders are not yet pricing in a broader escalation. The lack of follow-through in traditional markets may reflect expectations that Iran’s response will be contained or delayed, rather than immediate and destabilizing. Crude oil is holding its gains near $76 per barrel after spiking nearly 4% Sunday evening on fears that Iran could block the Strait of Hormuz, a key chokepoint for global oil shipments. Still, commentary from U.S. officials and muted early-week trading suggest that investors remain in a wait-and-see mode. In crypto markets, altcoins that had mirrored BTC’s weekend drop, like ether ETH, XRP XRP, and solana's SOL SOL, are also clawing back losses. For now, the market appears to be treating the U.S.-Iran clash as a geopolitical flashpoint, not a structural break. OKX Considering U.S. IPO: Report Crypto exchange OKX is considering a public listing in the U.S., according to a report from The Information . Earlier this year, the exchange announced a U.S. expansion after settling with the Department of Justice over accusations that it operated in the country without a money transmitter license. Among other crypto-linked companies, Bullish, a competitor to OKX and the parent company of CoinDesk, is also said to be considering an IPO given investors' appetite for companies with exposure to digital assets. OKX told CoinDesk it had no comment on the matter. Polymarket Bettors Less Certain About Second U.S. Strike on Iran Polymarket bettors are cooling to the idea that the U.S will hit Iran a second time before the end of the month. The 'yes' side of a contract asking if the U.S. will conduct another military action on Iran by June 30 is now trading at 54%, from 74% in the hours after the initial strike on Iranian nuclear sites. There appears to be a growing market belief that deconfliction – on both sides – is on the agenda, as evidenced by another contract asking bettors about the likelihood of Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz, which is currently trading at 49% down from 52% . Market Movements: BTC : Bitcoin rebounded to $101,419 after a volatile 4.5% intraday swing, finding strong support at $99,000 amid geopolitical tensions and surging institutional buying interest, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data. ETH: Ethereum fell 2.3% to $2,237 amid U.S.-Iran tensions, breaking a six-week consolidation pattern despite over $500 million in institutional accumulation. Gold: Bank of America analysts predict gold could hit $4,000 an ounce within a year, an 18% jump, driven less by geopolitical tensions and more by mounting U.S. fiscal debt and a global shift by central banks away from the dollar toward gold. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets fell Monday as the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites fueled oil price spikes and fears of broader Middle East escalation, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 0.56%.

The Wyoming Stable Token Commission (WYST) is a proposed virtual currency representative of and redeemable for one US dollar held in a trust by the state of Wyoming. In a post on the social media platform X, Aptos says that the state is looking to use either chain with Layer Zero infrastructure to deploy a potential stablecoin. “The Wyoming Stable Token Commission has placed Aptos as the highest-scoring blockchain candidate for WYST – the first fiat-backed stablecoin issued by a US State – tying for 1st place with Solana. WYST will be deployed using Layer Zero… Aptos is making borderless, always-on finance a reality today with three native USD stablecoins & $30 billion+ in monthly stablecoin volume, supported by sub-second finality and near-zero transaction fees at [around] $0.00055. Following the recent passing of the GENIUS Act to establish the first regulatory framework for stablecoins and Aptos pushing further as the chain for stablecoins, the future of finance is here on Aptos.” Last year, Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon said he would push for the adoption of a “transparent” stablecoin fully backed by the state’s short-term Treasury holdings. “One of the big things for me is to be able to bring back onshore a lot of our debt because if it’s bought by treasuries and supported by Treasurys, it will help to stabilize that market to a degree… [What] is clear to me is that digital assets are going to have a future.

2025-06-22T22:30:43,"Chainlink Transfers $149 Million To Binance – Another Post-Unlock Rally?","Chainlink (LINK) has come under intense pressure, shedding more than 33% of its value since hitting local highs in May. The combination of escalating Middle East tensions and growing macroeconomic uncertainty—fueled by rising US Treasury yields and a cautious Federal Reserve—has shaken investor confidence across crypto markets. In this environment, bulls have lost control of LINK’s trend, and the price now searches for a solid support base. Adding to the pressure, fresh on-chain data from Lookonchain reveals that noncirculating supply wallets associated with Chainlink deposited 17.875 million LINK—worth approximately $149 million—into Binance earlier today. This large inflow to a centralized exchange raises concerns about potential selling activity and has further weighed on market sentiment. Historically, Chainlink’s unlocks have often triggered volatile price action. While some of these events have preceded price rallies, current market conditions make any bullish response uncertain. The market is now closely watching how LINK will behave near critical support levels as the token battles both technical weakness and a challenging macro backdrop. Whether accumulation resumes or downside pressure intensifies will depend on how global risk appetite and on-chain behavior evolve in the coming days. Chainlink Faces Critical Support Test Amid Market Pressure Chainlink continues to build fundamental strength through key partnerships and steady development, even as global tensions and macroeconomic instability weigh heavily on altcoin markets. With growing adoption across traditional finance and Web3 infrastructure, LINK’s long-term outlook remains robust. However, short-term price action tells a different story. Since peaking in May, Chainlink has seen a steep retracement, now down over 33%, and must defend current levels to avoid triggering a deeper correction. Against the backdrop of escalating Middle East conflict and tightening financial conditions, most altcoins have lost ground relative to Bitcoin, and LINK has been no exception. Bitcoin dominance recently hit new highs, siphoning capital away from smaller-cap assets. As a result, Chainlink bulls are under pressure to protect key support levels and prevent further erosion of momentum. Adding to investor anxiety, Lookonchain data shows that Chainlink non-circulating supply wallets transferred 17.875 million LINK—valued at roughly $149 million—to Binance earlier today. These movements raise concerns of possible selling pressure. However, historical data provides some optimism. Chainlink has conducted 11 major unlocks in the past, and many were followed by price increases as liquidity was absorbed and demand recovered. LINK Price Analysis: Breakdown Extends As Support Levels Crumble Chainlink (LINK) is currently trading near $11.98 after breaking below key support zones that had previously held throughout Q2 2025. The daily chart clearly shows a persistent downtrend since mid-May, marked by a series of lower highs and lower lows. LINK has now lost over 33% since its May peak near $18, and the most recent candle confirms a clean breakdown below the $12 psychological level. The 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs) are all positioned above the current price, reflecting a strong bearish momentum. The 50-day SMA recently crossed below the 100-day SMA, reinforcing short-term weakness. Moreover, LINK is now trading at levels not seen since early November 2024, exposing the asset to further downside risk if no strong demand emerges soon. This technical deterioration comes as Lookonchain data reveals that 17.875 million LINK (worth $149M) from noncirculating wallets was deposited into Binance—fueling fears of further selling pressure. While historically many unlock events were followed by recoveries, the current macroeconomic environment, combined with Bitcoin dominance surging and altcoins underperforming, may delay any bounce.

2025-06-22T22:00:48,"Successful Audit and Holders Hype Might Make Ruvi AI (RUVI) The Next $1 Project, Can It Mimic Bitcoin’s (BTC) Rise?","Bitcoin (BTC) has long been the benchmark of success in the cryptocurrency space, soaring from under $1 to tens of thousands of dollars over its history.

With a structured growth model and a fast-growing community, Ruvi AI is inching closer to becoming the next $1 project. Could it replicate Bitcoin’s meteoric rise? Why Ruvi AI Is Emerging as a $1 Contender While Bitcoin built its empire on its scarcity and decentralized technology, Ruvi AI offers pragmatic utility by solving pressing challenges in marketing , entertainment , and finance.

Key measurable highlights include: Over $1.9 million raised so far More than 160 million tokens sold , showing strong demand Over 1,600 token holders , underscoring a solid and growing community Importantly, the post-presale valuation of $0.07 is not speculative hype but rather a part of Ruvi AI’s structured pricing strategy.

2025-06-22T21:45:55,"Coinbase CEO Says the World Needs Crypto Now More Than Ever","Coinbase, a leading digital currency platform, has made a strong statement about the future of global finance. The company believes crypto can help solve key problems in today’s financial system, such as rising debt, inflation, and growing distrust in banks. According to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, digital currencies like Bitcoin (BTC) are not just new forms of money. They are tools that can help build a stronger, fairer economy. Global Debt and Inflation Are Rising In a post on X, the Coinbase CEO highlighted serious problems in the global economy. Government debt is rising quickly, especially in the U.S., where the national debt has now reached over $36 trillion. At the same time, inflation makes money worth less and everyday costs higher. This makes it harder for people to save, invest, or plan. Armstrong said these issues are reducing economic freedom and trust in banks. Bitcoin and Digital Currencies Offer a New Option In response to these problems, more people are turning to digital assets like Bitcoin. Coinbase CEO says the rising price of the flagship crypto shows that people are looking for safer alternatives. These assets are becoming a place to protect wealth from inflation and government overspending. Unlike traditional money, crypto can be sent quickly and cheaply across borders. It does not rely on central banks or large financial firms. This gives people more control over their money, especially in places with weak banking systems or unstable currencies. Many crypto leaders have also suggested using Bitcoin to reduce the U.S. national debt. In February, a new report from VanEck, an investment management firm, shed light on whether this plan is feasible . Crypto Is Not Just About Investment The Coinbase leader explained that crypto is more than a way to make money. It is a technology that can improve the financial system. It can speed up payments, lower fees, and support new business ways. Artists and creators can earn income directly from their audience without giving a significant share to middlemen. Armstrong said Coinbase is building new tools to make this possible. These include simple business payment systems and a crypto card that rewards users in Bitcoin . Coinbase aims to make crypto valuable in everyday life, not just as an investment but as a practical solution for modern finance. Coinbase is Building A New Foundation for the Financial System According to Coinbase, the world needs to rebuild its financial system from the ground up. The company believes crypto can be the foundation for this change. Under the leadership of its CEO, Coinbase is expanding its role from a trading platform to a complete financial services provider. It now supports various digital tools and wants to help build the next generation of internet-based financial systems.

2025-06-22T21:26:07,"Long-Awaited Good News for Bitcoin Comes from Texas","Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed into law Bill SB 21, adding Bitcoin reserves to the state’s legal framework. With this move, Texas has become the third state in the US to create an official Bitcoin reserve. According to the Bitcoin Laws platform, which tracks digital asset laws, 47 strategic Bitcoin reserve bills have been introduced in 26 states so far, with 13 bills under active consideration at the federal level. This growing interest in digital asset reserves across the country parallels the policies of Donald Trump, who was re-elected in November 2024. Trump, who took office in January, has taken extensive steps to transform the U.S. into a more crypto-friendly environment, including reversing anti-crypto banking practices (debanking), appointing pro-crypto figures to key regulatory positions, and establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve.

The order also defined a “Digital Asset Stockpile,” which would include other digital assets such as XRP, SOL, and ADA.

2025-06-22T20:52:38,"Bitcoin Price Warnings Emerge, Stablecoins Score Regulatory Win: Binance Weekly Report","This week, the cryptocurrency space recorded a major win in the stablecoin sector despite geopolitical headwinds keeping markets in a risk-off stance. However, bitcoin (BTC) continued to consolidate until Friday before it plummeted due to tensions between Israel and Iran. A weekly report by the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, revealed that global markets have faced heightened volatility since the beginning of the week. The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady, but investors sold off their risk assets, including BTC and equities, as they sought safety. Bitcoin Consolidates Bitcoin and equities started the week with a rally, shrugging off the negative sentiment brought by geopolitical headlines. By mid-week, BTC retraced its steps and fell to $103,500, and investors moved to defensive assets as fears of a deeper Middle East geopolitical spillover resurfaced. The flight-to-safety trend was not just witnessed in bitcoin; ether and other large-cap altcoins saw similar moves. While investors moved from a risk-on to risk-off approach, Binance analysts found that structural demand for BTC remained resilient. The United States spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) market saw inflows totaling $2.4 billion across an eight-day streak that extended till June 18. The exchange said this was a sign of “dip-buying” by long-term investors. Spot Ethereum ETFs also saw notable positive flows, surpassing $605 million during the same period. In addition, on-chain metrics for Ethereum remained positive, with staked ether (ETH) surging to a record 34.9 million ETH, accounting for roughly 28.9% of the circulating supply. Analysts discovered that more than 500,000 ETH of the staked amount was added in the first two weeks of June. “This points to rising conviction in ETH’s yield potential and network security while further reducing liquid supply,” Binance stated. U.S. Senate Passes Stablecoin Bill On the regulatory front, the U.S. Senate passed the landmark Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act in a 68–30 vote on June 17. The bill is the first comprehensive regulatory framework for fully-reserved, anti-money laundering (AML)-compliant stablecoins. The next step for the GENIUS Act is to pass the House of Representatives before it can become law. Although the bill marks a major step forward for stablecoin regulation, it has raised concerns about the concentration of risk within the traditional banking system. This is because the Act mandates that stablecoin reserves be held by only federally regulated entities. Meanwhile, the policy win comes as stablecoin usage reaches record highs: the total supply has grown 22.5% since 2024 ended to exceed $250 billion, and on-chain transfer volumes have surpassed $20 trillion.

2025-06-22T20:39:55,"Best Crypto to Invest In As Whale Wallets Buy The World War III Fear","Global markets are sliding under the weight of conflict, with the United States now striking Iranian nuclear complexes while fighting spreads across the Middle East. Oil jumps and equities retreat in predictable lockstep, yet crypto moves with massive volatility. However, giant wallets that already command thousands of coins continue to absorb supply without pause. On-chain dashboards record week after week of inflows, highlighting purposeful accumulation rather than reflex trading. That quiet conviction is catching attention on retail message boards, where disbelief is giving way to curiosity. Many smaller traders now wonder whether disciplined buying by deep pockets is sketching the timeline for the next rally in both spot and derivatives venues, even while stocks bleed across benchmarks globally. Whales Double Down While War Intensifies Globally Look first at the wallets that set the tone. Michael Saylor, whose MicroStrategy pile rivals the treasuries of small nations, tweeted that fresh coins will reach the corporate vault on Monday, extending a buying streak that has barely paused all year. If the order executes at recent prices, the firm will cross the line of one point one percent of all Bitcoin ever to circulate. pic.twitter.com/wu9mMkxtUg — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 21, 2025 Saylor frames each purchase as insurance against sovereign muddles, and the weekend events lend weight to that view. Former President Donald Trump confirmed strikes on the Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan nuclear sites, a confrontation that rocked commodity charts but left Bitcoin liquidity deep and calm. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has been correcting and has seen a drop to the lower $101,000 levels, but then again, the buying activity from top investors globally seems to paint a different picture on the macro level. 🇸🇻 Update: El Salvador has boosted its Bitcoin stash by 8 BTC this week, pushing its total reserves to 6,215 BTC. pic.twitter.com/5hFTxa6UR6 — Crypto Jessica (@CryptoJessXBT) June 22, 2025 El Salvador chose the same moment to add eight more coins, lifting the national hoard to 6,215. The country’s average entry price now sits in the green, a detail officials celebrated by posting a profit tracker on social media. Institutional desks are reading the tape in similar fashion across major trading hubs worldwide. Trump Media filed for a fund that would hold Bitcoin and Ether, joining a queue of issuers now stretching out the door. Bloomberg data shows approval odds above 90% , and betting markets give Solana an even stronger shot at a green light before year-end. Seven managers have revised their Solana filings to include staking rewards, signalling an arms race to capture yield-hungry flows. As regulators inch toward clarity, heavy wallets treat volatility as a clearance sale rather than a threat. Naturally, these developments have created a sense of interest and intrigue among smaller investors now as well, who now speculate the crypto space to see another major rally once the war situation settles a bit and the purchases made by these top institutional buyers start to turn profitable. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Coins that Could Pump As Bitcoin Recovers BTC Bull BTC Bull is designed to turn every major Bitcoin milestone into a celebration for its holders. As the first official meme coin built entirely around Bitcoin’s rise, it goes far beyond the usual hype. It’s a structured reward engine built on Ethereum. Every time Bitcoin crosses a $25,000 price increment, BTC Bull triggers either a token burn or a BTC airdrop. When Bitcoin climbed from $75,000 to $100,000, a massive burn event permanently removed a portion of the $BTCBULL supply, tightening scarcity and energizing demand. The next milestone, $125,000, is already circled by the community. But the real prize lies at $250,000. A massive airdrop of actual Bitcoin awaits holders, weighted by both their token balance and the size of their Community Sale purchase. This means the earlier you joined and the more you held, the bigger your reward when Bitcoin hits that level. Smaller milestone rewards have already begun, with airdrops in wrapped BTC sent to loyal wallets every time the market breaks higher. Jacob Crypto Bury speculates BTCBULL to be a 100x crypto once it launches, which also adds to its growing popularity and demand further. Beyond the milestone mechanics, BTC Bull also features a secure staking contract with high APY options for those who want to lock in their tokens. While others chase volatility, stakers here quietly collect ongoing rewards with every block. The meme coin aspect draws attention, but underneath it is a model engineered for serious engagement. It’s a project that ties its entire incentive system to Bitcoin’s trajectory, offering utility that doesn’t just ride popularity, but mirrors Bitcoin’s actual momentum, one milestone at a time. SUBBD SUBBD rewrites how creators earn and how fans pay by moving the entire subscription loop onto a permissionless rail. Instead of laboring under card processors that take ten percent and settle weeks later, artists set a price in SUBBD, upload work, and watch the contract release funds in real time once content is unlocked. Video, audio, image, or text, every entry lives in decentralized storage with an access key issued only after a signed transaction. Because the escrow is autonomous, there are no chargebacks or surprise fees. That reliability has drawn established influencers who were losing income to fraud and geographical bank limits. Platform revenue arrives continuously rather than at the end of a pay cycle, which smooths cash flow and allows creators to plan production schedules with confidence. The token earns utility on both sides of the table. Fans who stake SUBBD receive loyalty boosts that lower future subscription costs and unlock exclusive polls or community calls. Meanwhile, part of every transaction fee routes to a buy and burn vault, compressing float as daily activity climbs. Network burn rate already outpaces new token emissions, which has turned the asset into a deflationary ticket. This architecture matters during wartime volatility because payment processors often suspend regions, yet the SUBBD rail remains open so global audiences stay connected to their favorite voices. With privacy, instant settlement, and a shrinking supply all built in, the project presents a secure, resilient gateway for content economies that need income certainty when wider markets wobble. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper introduces a Layer 2 experience for Bitcoin by stitching the asset to a Solana Virtual Machine environment that carries throughput in the thousands of transactions per second. The bridge starts on the base chain where a canonical address collects deposits. Relay contracts then confirm block headers and transactions in cryptographic proofs. When verification clears, wrapped BTC appears inside the Hyper ledger with finality measured in seconds and fees that sit comfortably below one cent. Transaction data does not bloat the network. Instead, an aggregator condenses blocks into concise bundles, generates a zero-knowledge proof, and posts the result back to Bitcoin for settlement. Security remains anchored to proof of work while performance rivals the fastest smart contract networks. Because the bridge is trustless, traders can enter and exit without surrendering custody. The HYPER token energizes every layer of the system. Holders stake to earn up to 509% APY during the ongoing presale, a rate funded by an allocation that reserves 15% of supply for community incentives. Additional slices distribute as 30% for development, 25% for the treasury, 20% for marketing, and 10% for exchange liquidity. Early demand is clear, with more than $1.5 million collected to date. By bringing cost-efficient settlement, rapid execution, and compatibility with Solana tooling, Bitcoin Hyper converts Bitcoin from a passive store of value into a platform ready for decentralized finance, gaming, and daily payments. Investors looking for infrastructure that tracks Bitcoin growth while adding real utility may find the proposition compelling. Best Wallet Token Best Wallet Token is not just a governance asset but a native fuel for one of the most ambitious self-custody rollouts in the retail crypto space. Built around a non-custodial wallet with deep integrations into swaps, dApps, and cross-chain analytics, the token plays a central role in user onboarding and platform activity. Holders receive perks such as zero-fee swaps, priority access to new token listings, and rebates in the form of BEST every time they perform wallet actions like bridging or staking. This encourages engagement and builds velocity in the ecosystem, particularly useful during times of heightened volatility when users demand direct control over their funds. In the current market, where exchanges can freeze assets due to regulatory shifts or political events, a secure and feature-rich wallet becomes critical infrastructure. Best Wallet leans into that by offering not just basic storage but real-time insights into on-chain activity and wallet-to-wallet alerts that notify users when major transactions occur from flagged or high-net-worth addresses. This layer of intelligence turns the wallet into a trading terminal, not just a vault. A percentage of all platform fees goes toward scheduled token burns, which have so far removed millions of BEST from circulation. With a deflationary supply, ongoing utility, and increasing wallet downloads since Q2, the token is gaining traction both as a store of platform value and a real-time reward instrument. As more institutional buyers turn to on-chain tools during uncertain times, BEST sits at the intersection of functionality, transparency, and adaptive rewards. Conclusion In a market defined by fear, the smartest capital is still buying. Whale wallets, corporate treasuries, and nation-state portfolios are moving with intent, not hesitation. That kind of activity is rarely casual. It signals a belief that the current chaos is not the end of a cycle but the beginning of a new phase. And while headlines may rattle weaker hands, the chain tells a clearer story—capital is positioning for something larger. For investors watching from the sidelines, this may be the time to look closer at assets designed not just to ride the next rally, but to benefit directly from the mechanics driving it. Some of them are already rewarding those who act early. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

2025-06-22T20:15:30,"Garden Finance Accused of Aiding $1.4B Crypto Laundering Scheme","Blockchain researcher ZachXBT has accused Garden Finance of helping to launder funds stolen in the massive $1.4 billion Bybit hack. The decentralized crypto swapping platform recently reported strong growth numbers. However, critics believe much of that activity may involve suspicious or criminal transactions. Garden Reports Busy Activity in Q2 2025 In its Q2 2025 report, Garden Finance shared data from Dune Analytics showing high transaction activity. The platform handled nearly 24,984 Bitcoin (BTC) in swaps, worth over $1.5 billion, across 40,571 atomic swaps. It also earned 40.11 BTC in fees, with one manual swap reaching a volume of 10 BTC. While these numbers were meant to highlight success, they quickly drew criticism. ZachXBT questioned the source of these high volumes and fees. He claimed over 80% of the platform’s earnings may have come from laundering stolen assets. He said Chinese agents linked to the North Korean Lazarus Group used Garden Finance to move the stolen funds. Garden Finance Response Stirred Controversy In response, Garden Finance executive Jax Gulati pointed to a past update from Q4 2024. He said the platform held only 30 BTC at the time of the Bybit hack and denied that it was centralized or pretending to be decentralized. Nevertheless, ZachXBT was not convinced. He mentioned other hacks, like the one on WazirX, to show a pattern. He claimed the same group kept using Garden Finance, raising concerns about who uses the platform and how it is being monitored. Further fueling the debate, a user named James Scaur commented on the nature of liquidity flow on Garden Finance. He said the reason one user seemed to control most of the liquidity could be explained by a Pareto distribution, which often happens in financial systems. According to him, this did not mean the platform was centralized. However, ZachXBT disagreed. He said one user had been making large swaps since the limit was raised to 10 cbBTC. He claimed this person added cbBTC through Coinbase and moved money linked to the Bybit hack. By April 2025, ZachXBT said most of the swaps on the platform were connected to this same group, which made the suspicious activity easier to spot. He questioned why the team at Garden Finance had not acted sooner. Garden Finance Allegedly Profits From Illegal Transactions ZachXBT accused Garden Finance of profiting from these illegal transactions. He said the team should return the fees earned from such swaps and shut down large transaction features. This has caused a big debate in the decentralized finance (DeFi). Similarly, Bybit asked ParaSwap DAO to return over $90,000 in ETH paid by a hacker in swap fees. He also claimed that part of the revenue was used in earlier airdrop farming, a strategy some use to unfairly benefit from new token releases.

In a new CNBC interview, the billionaire “Bond King” says that foreign investors have been happily investing in US assets over the last two decades, leading to massive capital inflows to the tune of tens of trillions of dollars. But now, Gundlach says he’s seeing signs that foreign investors are yanking capital out of US markets in favor of the euro and European equities. According to the hedge fund chief executive, the reversal in flows tells him that investors are now crowning a new market leader. “Foreigners have been very willing – downright enthusiastic, almost euphoric – about buying dollar assets over the past 18 years or so. Over $25 trillion has been invested in US financial markets, more than the US has invested in foreign markets. That’s a massive increase. It went from $3 trillion to $28 trillion by one measure. That may be reversing, and this is part of the underpinning for why I think that the trend of US outperformance is over. And I mean over for real… I’ve been recommending Europe in European currency for dollar-based investors. The [European] index has outperformed the US index by a decent amount, but if you had the currency side of it, if you own it in euros and you get the currency translation, you are just printing money right now.
