2025-06-23T07:52:56,"This is the Best Investment Today According to Prominent Bitcoin Bull","Strong bullish sentiment for silver. This is how Robert Kiyosaki feels for the precious metal as of June 2025. In his most recent post from today on social media platform X, the famous author has touted silver as “ the best investment today, June 2025 ”. He’s currently waiting for gold and Bitcoin (BTC) to drop further before he can add more positions, but why the sudden shift to silver? The investor, who predicted the financial crash in 2008, believes that this is a prime time for accumulating silver. Part of his reasoning stems from the fact that gold and Bitcoin are near their all-time high levels, as of the moment of writing. He’s boldly stated that silver is currently a “ bargain” at these prices, and his predictions are that it could 2X, or even 3X this year. He has steadily been warning his followers of the next financial crash, which he thinks will be throughout the summer. FYI: Silver is the best investment today….june 2025. Gold and Bitcoin are high and I am waiting for gold and Bitcoin to crash before I add to my position. That’s what I think. Do your own research. Take care. — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 23, 2025 What is The Outlook For Bitcoin (BTC)? He’s not shying away from the king crypto, as his predictions call for Bitcoin to reach $1M per coin, and he is not the only one who has made such high calls. Kiyosaki focuses more on the quantity of Bitcoin he has, and the number of ounces in gold/silver, as he has commented on a recent post of his. He has been accumulating since the price was $6000, and he “ wishes that he bought more ”. Kiyosaki has always been a Bitcoin bull, as he frequently discusses it across all of his social channels aimed financial literacy. He, like many others is with the strong belief that BTC will be a hedge against inflation and a wealth-building tool.

2025-06-23T07:48:23,"XRP Quietly Thriving In Japan Payment Sector. Here’s the Latest","Mai, co-founder of the XRPL Japan Association, shared a video on X from the XRPL Japan Community Day after-party showing a person paying for beer and tacos using XRP. The transaction was completed through a mobile phone, visually demonstrating the token’s utility in a real-world setting. According to her caption, the payment was successfully executed with XRP, underscoring ongoing efforts to promote real-world use cases for the digital asset within Japan’s growing XRP community. XRP Payment in Action at Community Gathering The video depicted a casual but purposeful demonstration of XRP being used to settle a transaction for food and drinks. This simple but important moment was showcased as part of a larger effort to normalize digital payments through the XRP Ledger. The setting—a relaxed after-party following XRPL Japan Community Day—allowed attendees and followers to witness the practicality of XRP in informal, day-to-day scenarios. The visual of the person using their mobile device to pay underscored the token’s potential as a reliable medium of exchange. Paying for beer and tacos by XRP at the after party of @XRPLJapan Community Day pic.twitter.com/YaDp8eHUKC — Mai ＠Xaman/XRPL Japan (@Mai_XRPLJapan) June 21, 2025 Mixed Reactions from the XRP and Crypto Communities Responses to Mai’s post varied widely. Some users drew comparisons to early Bitcoin milestones. One such reaction came from Michael Gigliotti, who suggested that the moment might be remembered similarly to Bitcoin’s first commercial transaction—paying for pizza in 2010. In a related tone, a commenter named LFC Fan entertained the idea that this could one day be seen as “XRP Taco Day,” alluding to a potential tradition within the XRP community that commemorates its early real-world uses. Not all replies shared this optimistic view. A more critical response came from a user identified as Shine195, who expressed frustration with XRP’s lack of price movement and perceived it as underwhelming in comparison to Bitcoin. They criticized the continued positioning of XRP alongside BTC, asserting that XRP lags significantly in value and market performance. Such comments reflect a long-standing split within the community between those who focus on utility and those who prioritize asset appreciation. Local Utility as a Driver for Broader Adoption Mai’s video and the broader XRPL Japan Community Day serve as part of a larger strategy to advance the perception of XRP as more than just a speculative asset. By making it visible in ordinary, real-world contexts—such as buying tacos and drinks—advocates aim to underscore its transaction efficiency and simplicity. These grassroots applications help the public engage with the token outside the abstract discussions on blockchain or trading platforms. As more community events adopt similar practices, such demonstrations may serve as blueprints for broader adoption in retail and social settings.

2025-06-23T07:40:52,"Tether adds $2 billion worth of new USDT on Tron","Tether minted $2 billion worth of new USDT on the Tron blockchain to boost its reserves and prepare for higher demand. The minting happened in two steps as the company made $1 billion earlier and later added another $1 billion, which CEO Paolo Ardoino confirmed. Whale Alert posted on X , highlighting the latest $1 billion USDT mint at Tether’s Treasury address. Paolo Ardoino explained that the USDT is “authorized but not issued”. Tether holds it in reserve for future use, like customer redemptions or moving tokens between blockchains. Tether creates new USDT to meet future needs Tether’s recent decision to mint $2 billion worth of USDT on the Tron blockchain comes after another $1 billion USDT mint on Ethereum on June 18, just before the U.S. Federal Reserve’s latest FOMC meeting . Tether has created a historic pattern in which it preemptively boosts stablecoin reserves ahead of possible liquidity surges. So many investors and analysts now assume the company expects the market conditions to change. Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain said the company is preparing in advance for expected demand because it is issuing large amounts of USDT without putting it directly into circulation. Stablecoins like USDT also lack the volatility of regular cryptocurrencies. They are common in market trends that Tether’s minting behavior follows, such as when investors increase their activity or when trading volumes spike on major exchanges. Popular crypto investor and commentator Lark Davis described the minting as a sign that “dry powder” is entering the system. This means the capital exists and will be deployed once favorable market conditions arise. His comments show hope of an upcoming shift to a more risk-on investment environment if the Fed leans toward cutting interest rates or signaling continued support for financial markets. Tether builds up reserves to keep USDT stable Tether continues to grow its reserves to support the stability and trust behind its popular stablecoin tied to the value of the U.S. dollar, USDT. Minting more tokens and holding them in reserve gives users confidence that they can always redeem their USDT for dollars if needed because it proves each USDT in circulation is fully supported by assets of equal value. The most recent $2 billion minting happened on the Tron blockchain because Tron offers fast and low-cost transfers for users who need to move large amounts of money quickly and affordably. Tether is giving users more flexibility in how they use the token and allowing exchanges and crypto to choose the network that best suits their needs in terms of speed and transaction fees by spreading USDT across multiple blockchains like Tron, Ethereum, and others. Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, said the newly minted USDT allows the company to respond faster to future demands from exchanges, institutional clients , or users who want to swap USDT between blockchains. This is because they are created in advance and held in Tether’s treasury as inventory. The company says it issues new tokens to ensure smooth service, not to influence or predict price movements, but some people in the crypto community think these large mints usually happen before Bitcoin and Ethereum prices rise and show incoming market rallies Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Naturally, the financial markets have responded negatively to this news, and the crypto market has not been left out. Interestingly, the Bitcoin price had sat above the $100,000 psychological level for the longest. However, it was only a matter of time before it lost this support and crashed further, especially as the digital asset seems to only have major support in the 5-digit territory. Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Is Headed Below $90,000 In a TradingView post, crypto analyst Master Ananda has revealed major bearish formations for the Bitcoin price. With the $100,000 support having held so far through the last week, it suggested there is still some buying going on for the cryptocurrency. However, the chart does not show enough strength to hold this level. Related Reading: XRP On-Chain Activity Down 80% In 5 Months, Experts Argue Bullish/Bearish Implications Since the market has been rocked by over $1 billion in liquidations in the last week, it has transferred some weakness to the BTC price, putting the bears in charge once again. Pointing this out, Master Ananda explains that the weekly chart, in particular, is not showing any good signs. The current Bitcoin price action seems to only be a continuation of the bearish price action that began after it hit a peak of $111,900 back on May 19, 2025. Since then, the decline has been consistent, and the crypto analyst says the market looks “terrible” right now. Given the crash, the major support for Bitcoin is no longer above $100,000, but over 10% below it. As the price has previously broken below $100,000, the first support the market could see would be at $88,888. Failure to hold at this point would trigger another 5% decline toward $82,500 before bulls are able to put up any fight. What Happens If BTC Stays Above $100,000? While the bearish trend is the most dominant at this point, there is still the possibility that the Bitcoin price could stay back above $100,000 and hold the fort there. In this case, it is likely that the bullish trend would continue. The crypto analyst highlights this in another post, forecasting a very sharp upward move if this happens. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Divergence That Appeared Before The May ATH Has Returned Again In the case of a recovery, then Bitcoin could retest the upper trendline that sits right above $108,000. And as for how long all of this could take to play out, the crypto analyst believes that the entire thing shouldn’t take more than two weeks to actually unfold and pick a direction. “Do not be afraid if the market shakes, Bitcoin is going up; Crypto will grow, regardless of the short-term,” the analyst said in closing.

2025-06-23T07:24:17,"Projected Timeline for $10,000 In XRP to Become $1 Million","The possibility of turning a $10,000 XRP investment into $1 million remains one of the more ambitious yet widely discussed goals among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. As XRP continues to build momentum, several analysts and platforms have offered forecasts on how and when this milestone could realistically be achieved. This article reviews the valuation milestones required to reach the million-dollar mark and evaluates predictions from industry figures and research platforms regarding the timelines involved. Understanding What It Takes to Reach $1 Million from $10K in XRP At the current trading price of approximately $2, a $10,000 investment would acquire 5,000 XRP tokens. For this amount to grow into a $1 million portfolio, XRP would need to rise by nearly 9,900% to reach $200 per coin. Reaching this price level would mark a historically significant leap for XRP, surpassing its all-time high of $3.84 recorded during the 2017–2018 bull cycle. Though XRP has delivered major gains in previous cycles, replicating such growth in today’s market conditions poses substantial challenges. At $200 per unit, XRP’s total market capitalization would exceed $12 trillion. This would place its value above the combined market caps of several of the world’s largest technology firms, including Apple and Google. As a result, while the math behind the $10,000-to-$1 million scenario is straightforward, its feasibility continues to be debated among analysts and investors. Forecasts Suggest Varied Timelines to the $210 Mark Analysts have outlined different scenarios and timelines for when XRP could reach the required $200 price level. Among the more optimistic voices is Javon Marks, who believes XRP could reach $200 as a result of what he describes as a breakout from its “largest coil pattern of all time.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He draws a comparison to XRP’s multi-year consolidation from 2014 to 2017, which preceded a major rally. Marks believes the 2017–2024 period resembles that earlier setup, stating he still holds a triple-digit outlook for XRP in the current market cycle. In line with this bullish perspective, some in the XRP community have projected even higher valuations, with certain estimates ranging up to $305. These expectations are built on confidence in XRP’s long-term positioning and its potential role in the evolving financial system. On the other hand, several research platforms present more conservative projections. According to Telegaon , XRP might not reach $236 until 2050. This places the $1 million outcome over two decades into the future. Similarly, Changelly’s forecast suggests a timeline between 2034 and 2040 for XRP to reach $200. These estimates reflect a cautious approach and assume a more gradual pace of adoption and market growth. Contrasting Views from the XRP Community and Analysts Within the XRP community, such long-term projections are often dismissed as overly cautious. Critics of the 2050 and 2040 timelines argue that these projections stem from analysts who are unwilling to consider XRP’s future potential. Some community members attribute these estimates to “Bitcoin maxis” who prioritize Bitcoin’s dominance over competing digital assets. A notable alternative view comes from BarriC, a respected voice within the XRP ecosystem. He has predicted that XRP could reach $200 between 2032 and 2033. This estimate, while still conservative compared to Marks’ outlook, is viewed by many as more reasonable and achievable. Additionally, Matthew Brienen, Chief Operating Officer of CryptoGuard, has stated that XRP could reach $1,000 by 2035 , implying an earlier arrival at the $200 threshold. While the goal of turning a $10,000 investment in XRP into $1 million requires the token to reach $200, opinions differ widely on when such a price level might be reached. From as early as this cycle to as late as 2050, expert predictions span decades. Despite this range, interest in XRP’s long-term trajectory remains strong.

(@Metaplanet_JP) June 23, 2025 Metaplanet’s latest acquisition marks a major milestone in its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy, which commenced in mid-2024 and accelerated through early 2025. Since December 2024, the company has grown its stash nearly 28-fold since it formalized its Bitcoin Treasury Operations as a core business initiative, pivoting from its hotel management business. The investment company also reported a quarter-to-date BTC yield of 107.9%, up from 95.6% in Q1 and 309.8% in Q4 2024. The firm uses the metric as a key performance indicator to track Bitcoin per fully diluted share over time, excluding the effects of dilution. Metaplanet also posted a BTC gain of 4,367 BTC for $451.2 million for the ongoing quarter, based on reference prices from Bitflyer. The Tokyo-based firm has funded its Bitcoin purchases through a series of capital market activities, including multiple zero-coupon bond issuances and equity-based investments. Since January, Metaplanet has issued and redeemed more than a dozen series of ordinary bonds and stock acquisition rights, largely subscribed by EVO FUND. The company has issued over 210 million shares under its ‘210 Million Plan.’ The investment firm’s board of directors resolved on June 16 to issue $210 million via no-interest bonds and raised that figure to buy more BTC. Metaplanet revealed that it aims to purchase 210,000 Bitcoins by the end of 2027. According to Bitbo data, if successful, the acquisition would make the company the second-largest holder of Bitcoin among public companies, behind Michael Saylor’s company, Strategy. Previously, under the firm’s 21 million plan, it would hold 21,000 BTC by the end of 2026, with no concrete plan for more buys. Between May and June 2025 alone, the company raised over $300M through bonds and exercised stock rights, with proceeds explicitly allocated for Bitcoin accumulation. A June 3 report from Standard Chartered found that, the Bitcoin reserve strategy trend has led to 61 publicly listed firms out of a total of 124 now holding a combined 3.2% of all BTC that will ever exist. Bitcoin remains resilient amid ongoing global geopolitical tensions Metaplanet added to its Bitcoin reserves amid an escalation in the Middle East war and the looming uncertainty over global financial markets.

North Korean Hackers Keep Targeting the Crypto Industry June 23, 2025 • 08:19 UTC The North Korean hacker group known as Famous Chollima is targeting crypto job applicants on a wide scale . They’re using a job application process to deceive those active in the crypto industry with a Python-based malware dubbed PylangGhost. Victims, mostly India-based at the time of writing, are deceived into downloading the malware on their devices under the guise of “video drivers” being required for the process. The malware is delivered via a zip file with an innocuous name , such as nvidia.py .

2025-06-23T07:10:01,"Exclusive: Jetking to Become India’s Bitcoin Giant, Targets 18,000 BTC Inspired by Saylor","The post Exclusive: Jetking to Become India’s Bitcoin Giant, Targets 18,000 BTC Inspired by Saylor appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Jetking, India’s IT training institute, has been a household name for decades. But behind its classrooms and job-ready courses lies a big financial strategy few expected — a growing Bitcoin treasury inspired by none other than Michael Saylor, the Strategy CEO known for turning Bitcoin into a corporate asset. From Napster to Bitcoin: Jetking’s Early Bet on Decentralization In an exclusive interview with Coinpedia, Jetking’s CFO Siddarth Bharwani revealed the company’s long-standing interest in peer-to-peer systems since the Napster era. So, when Bitcoin emerged, its decentralized structure instantly clicked with Jetking’s tech-savvy leadership. By 2017, the company began exploring Bitcoin. But it was Saylor’s high-profile move to institutionalize Bitcoin at MicroStrategy that truly changed the game for Jetking, transforming their view of Bitcoin from a tech curiosity to a potential treasury asset. “It was Michael Saylor’s move to institutionalize Bitcoin on MicroStrategy’s balance sheet that catalysed our own shift in perspective — highlighting Bitcoin not just as a technology, but as a transformative treasury asset. This conviction led us to formally begin accumulating Bitcoin in March 2022.,” the CFO shared. COVID-19: The Crisis That Forced a Financial Rethink Jetking’s pivot to Bitcoin wasn’t just driven by curiosity, it was born out of survival. The pandemic devastated Jetking’s operations, wiping out 40 years of physical expansion in just 12 months. In March 2022, Jetking took its first steps, formally buying Bitcoin as a treasury asset. “We looked at Bitcoin and Bitcoin being the hardest money available on earth, we went ahead and bought Bitcoin on our Balance sheet,” he said. 18,000 Bitcoin by 2030: The Big Bet Jetking isn’t stopping at a few Bitcoins. The company has an ambitious roadmap to accumulate 210 BTC by 2025, and eventually reach 18,000 BTC by 2030. “Capital efficiency is maximized through Fundraises, cash flow recycling and market-hedged exposure — all while aligning dilution control with long-term Bitcoin appreciation and shareholder value creation.” The company is focusing on capital efficiency, market-hedged exposure, and disciplined fundraises, all while keeping shareholder dilution under control. They want to build Bitcoin exposure the smart way, not the reckless way. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This buying came amid the ongoing Iran-Israel war, which has caused the entire crypto market to drop 5% to 10%. Metaplanet Bought 1,100 Bitcoin According to the Metaplanet report , the latest Bitcoin was purchased at an average price of 15,535,502 yen per BTC, which is roughly $105,946 per Bitcoin. Despite the high price tag, MetaPlanet seems calm. What makes this move even more remarkable is the 306.7% year-to-date (YTD) return MetaPlanet has achieved in 2025 alone. This performance reflects not just Bitcoin’s strong rally this year, but also the firm’s strategic timing and belief in Bitcoin as a store of value. Metaplanet 1% Bitcoin Plan As of June 23, the Metaplanet holds a massive 11,111 BTC, acquired for around $1.07 billion, at an average cost basis of $95,869 per Bitcoin. Meanwhile, just last week, Metaplanet bought 1,112 more Bitcoins for about $117.2 million. But the company isn’t stopping there. Metaplanet has already announced plans to raise $5.4 billion, aiming to own 1% of all Bitcoin in existence, about 210,000 BTC, by the end of 2027. It’s one of the boldest Bitcoin strategies ever seen from a public company. Metaplanet Stock Price plummets by 8% The market has been watching Metaplanet’s Bitcoin moves closely. After the announcement, Metaplanet’s stock price showed some volatility. On June 23, 2025, Metaplanet shares closed at 1635 JYP, down 8.77% for the day, following a period of strong gains earlier in the month. The recent dip reflects broader market jitters, not just from the Bitcoin purchase but also due to the escalating conflict in the Middle East, which has rattled global stocks.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/metaplanet-adds-1111-more-bitcoins-now-holds-over-1-billion-in-btc/,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

After U.S. airstrikes targeted three major Iranian nuclear sites, President Donald Trump declared the attacks a “success,” warning of intensified retaliation if provoked. These strikes come after a week of conflict between Israel and Iran, rattling global markets. Against this geopolitical backdrop, the market capitalisation of the industry dropped 1.50% to $3.1 trillion. Trading volume spiked 26.23% to $136.38 billion as volatility followed with full force. Bitcoin is down 1.27% at $101,497.55, Ethereum lost 1.99% to trade at $2,241.94, and XRP slipped 2.52% to $2.02. Talking about sentiments, the Fear & Greed Index dropped to 37, highlighting growing investor anxiety. Crypto Liquidations Today Surge to $647M In the past 24 hours, total crypto liquidations rose to $647.41 million, affecting over 185,000 traders. Of these, long positions accounted for a whopping $504.95 million, indicating that bullish traders were caught off guard by the swift price reversal. It is worth nothing that the largest liquidation was a $35.45 million BTC-USDT long on HTX. Source: CoinGlass Bybit led the exchanges with $252.46 million in liquidations, followed by Binance at $137.57M and Gate with $96.57M. The majority of liquidated positions were long, with ratios as high as 95.14% on Bitmex and over 90% on Bitfinex and CoinEx. Which signal a strong bias toward expecting upward price movement that ultimately collapsed. Crypto Market Cap Analysis The total crypto market cap currently sits at $3.09 trillion, recovering slightly from an intraday low of $3.04T. Technically, the price touched the lower Bollinger Band, suggesting potential oversold conditions. The RSI at 38.41 also hints at bearish exhaustion, with room for a short-term relief bounce. However, the market remains below the 20-day SMA of $3.23T, confirming ongoing downward pressure. With BTC dominance at a cycle-high of 64.9%, altcoins are underperforming. ETH dominance has slipped to 8.7%, reflecting broader weakness across major Layer 1s. While the market has witnessed the wrath of external influences, the business still has top gainers in this chaotic session. Which include Story IP with +11.35% intraday gains, Four with +10.39% price surge, and Sonic with +7.68% gains, showing that select microcaps are still attracting speculative interest. Also read our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! FAQs 1. Why are crypto liquidations so high right now? The $647M liquidation spike comes from a sharp market downturn triggered by geopolitical tensions and overly optimistic long positions getting wiped out. 2. What does a Fear & Greed Index of 37 mean? An index reading of 37 signals “Fear,” indicating investors are cautious. 3. Is the crypto market likely to recover soon? Technically, the RSI and Bollinger Band levels suggest a potential short-term rebound. However, recovery will heavily depend on geopolitical developments.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-liquidations-today-wipe-out-185000-traders-and-647-million/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-06-23T07:04:14,"Hacking Group Targets Insurance Giant Aflac – Personal and Medical Data May Be at Risk: Report","A sophisticated hacking group has reportedly compromised American insurance company Aflac, putting customers’ personal information at risk. The company is investigating a breach on its US network with characteristics consistent with the hacking collective known as the Scattered Spider, Reuters reports . The group, sometimes referred to as “UNC3944,” is believed to be mostly made up of young adults and based in the US and the UK. It’s known to have made several other high-profile breaches targeting Visa, Marks & Spencer, PNC Financial Services Group Inc. and several others. An Aflac spokesperson says the firm is still in the early stages of reviewing the attack and that it is not yet ready to divulge information relating to the number of affected customers or how long the investigation will go on. Aflac, which offers accident and pet insurance plans in the US and Japan to its 50 million users, has now potentially exposed its customers’ personal information, including their Social Security numbers and health-related information. Steve Cagle, CEO at healthcare security firm Clearwater, says that Scattered Spider’s specialty seems to be social engineering techniques, such as tricking help desks into resetting credentials and bypassing multi-factor authentication. The group is also known to be expert SIM swappers, which is when a hacker takes control of a target’s mobile phone plan in order to receive their 2FA (two-factor authentication) codes and log in to their accounts. Noah Michael Urban, a member of the group, was recently ordered to pay back $13.2 million to 59 victims after being charged with masterminding a SIM swapping scheme, according to The Register . Urban is currently facing 20 years in federal prison on each wire fraud charge.

2025-06-23T06:21:24,"Robert Kiyosaki Predicts Biggest Market Crash in History Is Coming","The post Robert Kiyosaki Predicts Biggest Market Crash in History Is Coming appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market slipped over the weekend as rising Middle East tensions and inflation fears triggered a selloff. Bitcoin dropped below $99,000 for the first time since May, with Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin also falling sharply. Though prices slightly recovered by late Sunday, major coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum remained down, reflecting investor caution amid growing global uncertainty. The rising geopolitical tensions after Trump’s strike on Iran and the continuous debt pressure weigh on markets. Amid this unease, renowned author and investor Robert Kiyosaki has renewed his warning about what he calls the “biggest global debt bubble burst in history.” As digital assets and traditional markets fluctuate, Kiyosaki’s predictions are again sparking conversations across the financial world. GLOBAL MONETARY COLLAPSE COMING? Will you be richer or poorer when biggest debt bubble in history bursts. I recommend owning gold, silver, and BITCOIN if you want to be richer when the Global Debt Bubble bursts. BIGGEST LOSERS will be savers of fake fiat money and especially… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 23, 2025 Kiyosaki’s Call for Tangible Assets In a recent X post, Kiyosaki urged investors to move away from fiat currency savings and instead build positions in tangible assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin. His long-held belief is that these alternatives offer better protection against looming economic instability. He reiterated that the global economy is dangerously inflated with debt and that a collapse is not only possible but likely. Past Predictions Back in Focus I shouldn’t brag but in 2013 I published “Rich Dads Prophecy” predicting the world economy today. It still pisses-me -off that so many modern day “prophets” whose names I will not mention, due to “professional courtesy” are now claiming to have warned of this extreme crisis we… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 19, 2025 Kiyosaki’s views aren’t new. He previously discussed similar warnings in his book Rich Dad’s Prophecy, which he claims accurately forecasted today’s economic scenario. Lately, he’s expressed frustration over what he sees as newer voices gaining recognition for insights he believes he shared years ago. His prediction of a potential silver surge, possibly doubling in value by year-end, has also resurfaced in recent discussions, further strengthening his focus on commodities. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Exclusive Bitcoin Price Prediction: Jetking CFO Expects BTC to Hit $150K by Year-End , Looking at the current scenario, he bets high on silver and believes it is the best investment right now, as of June 2025. He believes gold and Bitcoin are currently too expensive and is waiting for a price drop before buying more. Impact on Investor Sentiment Kiyosaki’s warning hits hard for many investors who are already nervous about the shaky state of the global economy. While some think he’s being overly dramatic, others agree with his advice to move money into things like gold, silver, and Bitcoin instead of relying too much on regular cash savings. With growing doubts about the strength of traditional currencies, his message is gaining attention. As markets face more uncertainty, voices like Kiyosaki’s, whether you agree with them or not, are pushing more people to think about where their money is safest during tough times. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

How do geopolitical tensions and inflation affect the crypto market? Geopolitical tensions and inflation fears increase investor caution, leading to selloffs in risky assets like cryptocurrencies as investors seek safer havens. What are the broader consequences of a crypto market crash on traditional markets? While direct contagion is debated, significant crypto crashes can reflect broader risk-off sentiment, impacting investor confidence and potentially leading to sell-offs in correlated traditional assets.

2025-06-23T06:18:57,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Can BTC Reclaim the $103K Level After Sharp Rebound?","The Bitcoin price today is trading around $101,530 after recovering sharply from a deep selloff that sent the asset below the $99,000 mark. BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) This bounce aligns with the lower boundary of a multi-month ascending channel, reinforcing the technical importance of the $99,250–$100,000 region as a strong macro support. However, the price is now approaching dense EMA resistance zones near $102,800–$104,500, raising questions about the sustainability of this rebound. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) BTC staged a strong intraday rally from a low of $98,600 back to above $101,000, printing a bullish engulfing structure on the 4-hour chart.

2025-06-23T06:14:15,"4 Things That Could Rattle Bitcoin and Crypto Markets This Week","Crypto markets took a big dip in late trading on Sunday, with Bitcoin falling below $100,000 for the first time since early May, but it appears to be recovering already. Markets have been highly volatile over the past week amid geopolitical tensions and the US air strike on Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend. Those tensions escalated with Iran threatening to close the Straits of Hormuz, a key shipping channel, which would impact global oil prices. Russia has also reportedly stated that countries are ready to supply Iran with nuclear weapons. This market has all your answers: Over the last 72 hours, the US bombed Iranian nuclear sites, Russia said countries are ready to supply Iran with nukes, and Iran’s parliament voted to close the Strait of Hormuz.

Crypto Market Outlook Digital assets continued to weaken over the weekend following US military action in the Middle East and more rhetoric from Iran and Russia as the situation escalates. Markets lost 4% in a fall to $3.15 trillion but managed to recover slightly during early trading in Asia on Monday morning. Losses were led by Bitcoin, which fell to $98,500 briefly in its first sub-six-figure dip since May 8. However, BTC had reclaimed the $101,000 level at the time of writing. Ethereum dumped more than 7% in a fall to $2,135, its lowest level since it broke above $2,000 in early May. Nevertheless, it also made a minor recovery to trade around $2,240 on Monday morning. Altcoins were all in the red aside from Hyperliquid as markets continue to weaken again.

According to Wedson, Binance’s spot trading volume has once again reached a dominant position in the market, which historically means a bullish signal for Bitcoin. Joao Wedson said the following in a statement on his social media account: “Binance’s Spot volume is now equal to all other exchanges combined. Also, Binance’s Spot volume is 10 times larger than Coinbase. The gap between Binance and other exchanges in spot volume is about to turn positive, which has triggered bull periods for Bitcoin in the past. Therefore, it is important to follow this trend closely.” Wedson also called on investors to make data-based evaluations, saying, “Off-chain data does not lie. Be careful.” Related News: Caution: A New Type of Cryptocurrency Scam Has Emerged - Here Are the Precautions to Take The Alphractal team, on the other hand, announced in their analysis of on-chain data that old whales, the classic big investors of Bitcoin, have not yet taken action. Stating that BTC transaction volumes over $ 100,000 remain at 2020 levels, the analysis stated that such big movements are usually seen in bull markets, but there has been no significant increase since 2022. Joao Wedson also drew attention to the “Bitcoin Long Term Power Law” model that he uses for Bitcoin’s long-term price prediction. This special log-log scale chart reveals Bitcoin’s potential with trend lines drawn with linear regression. According to Wedson, according to this model, it seems unlikely that the BTC price will remain below $108,000 until 2033, as it would contradict Bitcoin's historical growth curve. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-23T05:58:20,"Michael Saylor Predicts Bitcoin Will Hit $21M by 2046","Saylor pointed to the U.S. government's shifting stance and legislative momentum as key catalysts. Meanwhile, Blockstream CEO Adam Back defended the premium on Strategy stock by pointing to the firm's rapid BTC accumulation. BTC Prague also shed some light on Europe’s potential in Bitcoin adoption, as Jan3’s Samson Mow met with French lawmaker Sarah Knafo to discuss a national Bitcoin reserve. France’s recent crypto investments could mean that there is growing interest, though EU-wide adoption still faces regulatory hurdles. Saylor Sees Bitcoin at $21 Million Bitcoin bull and Strategy founder Michael Saylor delivered a strikingly optimistic forecast for Bitcoin during his keynote speech at the BTC Prague 2025 event. He predicted that the leading cryptocurrency could reach a price of $21 million within 21 years. Saylor’s bold projection is a big increase from his previous forecast at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, where he envisioned Bitcoin reaching $13 million by 2045. This dramatic revision reflects what Saylor described as an extraordinary shift in the geopolitical and regulatory landscape surrounding Bitcoin over the past year. Saylor credited his bullishness to unprecedented developments that he claimed were unimaginable just 11 months ago. Chief among these was the White House’s apparent embrace of Bitcoin, which he said was a landmark moment in US political history. He pointed to Donald Trump’s election victory in November of 2024 as a pivotal moment that ushered in a new era of pro-Bitcoin politics. According to Saylor, the notion that the United States could establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve or proclaim itself a global Bitcoin superpower was once inconceivable but is now becoming reality. Michael Saylor speaking at the BTC Prague event In addition to political changes, Saylor pointed out major legislative advancements, including progress on three crypto-focused bills in the United States — the Genius Act, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, and the Bitcoin Act. He also mentioned that individual US states are increasingly embracing Bitcoin, which helps solidify the asset’s place in the mainstream financial system. While Saylor is an advocate for Bitcoin, his views on custody have attracted some criticism. Although Strategy holds a massive Bitcoin treasury — now totaling 592,100 BTC — the company refused to disclose the exact storage details of these holdings. Saylor pointed to security concerns as the reason for withholding proof-of-reserves information. His previous opposition to self-custody also sparked backlash. However, he reversed this stance in October 2024 by stating his support for self-custody by those “willing and able.” The BTC Prague event itself saw strong support for self-custody and open-source Bitcoin tools. Danny Sanders, chief commercial officer at Trezor, reported that more than 5,000 attendees participated in the event. Adam Back Defends Strategy’s Stock Premium Blockstream CEO Adam Back defended the premium on Strategy stock by saying it is justified given how quickly the company doubles its Bitcoin per share. Back also spoke at BTC Prague in an interview with Bitcoin podcaster Stephan Livera, where he explained that Strategy’s track record of growing its Bitcoin per share every 16 to 18 months reduces risk for investors, making the 2x multiple seen in MSTR stock trading “not unreasonable.” He explained that this growth rate means that investors can reach parity with the market net asset value (mNAV) in about a year and a half, effectively de-risking their position. Back pointed out that Strategy’s stock premium—which is currently around 1.7x on a basic share basis and 1.9x on a diluted basis—is backed by a solid asset base. The company has aggressively used leverage through at-the-market equity offerings and convertible senior notes to build up its Bitcoin reserves, now valued at approximately $60.89 billion. Despite MSTR’s recent price decline of 7.45% over the past 30 days, Back held firm that evaluating the time required to “overcome the premium” is a useful lens for investors in Bitcoin treasury stocks. Strategy Bitcoin holdings (Source: Saylor Tracker ) He warned that while elevated mNAVs can be speculative, they also often come with high potential yields. Still, such positions can lead to volatility and investor unease. As an example, he pointed to Japanese firm Metaplanet, which has seen its mNAV fluctuate between 5 and 10. Back acknowledged that holding the stock during such swings could be nerve-wracking, but said the firm has consistently rebounded. Metaplanet recently expanded its Bitcoin holdings to 10,000 BTC after a new purchase on June 16, which allowed it to surpass Coinbase to become the seventh-largest publicly listed Bitcoin holder. France Could Lead Europe’s Bitcoin Future Meanwhile, Jan3 founder Samson Mow is turning his attention to promoting Bitcoin adoption at the nation-state level in Europe, after a promising meeting with pro-Bitcoin French lawmaker and European Parliament member Sarah Knafo at BTC Prague. Mow shared on social media that the two discussed creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for France and pushing for more favorable regulations toward Bitcoin. He is optimistic about launching a wave of nation-state Bitcoin adoption starting in France and potentially spreading across Europe. Knafo said that France must take a leading role in the conversation around Bitcoin. She described her meeting with Mow as an “excellent discussion,” and called him a seasoned expert in national Bitcoin strategies, including his advisory role with El Salvador’s government. Mow resigned from Blockstream in 2022 to focus entirely on Bitcoin nation-state adoption through his company Jan3. He confirmed that his team has been invited to France for further discussions. Knafo also met with Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor, and called him “visionary and ambitious.” He even suggested that more Bitcoin-related projects are on the horizon for France and the broader European region. France has recently shown increasing engagement with Bitcoin through both government and private initiatives. Earlier this month, Paris-based Blockchain Group purchased 624 Bitcoin for €60.2 million, bringing its total holdings to 1,471 BTC. Additionally, France’s state-owned bank Bpifrance announced in March that it would invest €25 million into purchasing cryptocurrencies to support local blockchain projects. Despite these developments, there are still concerns about the pace of crypto adoption across Europe. Some industry leaders argue that the region continues to lag behind other parts of the world due to regulatory hesitation and limited institutional participation. Elisenda Fabrega, general counsel at European RWA tokenization platform Brickken, pointed to a lack of corporate engagement and structural barriers that prevented Bitcoin from being embraced as a reserve asset. The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, while now fully in effect as of December 2024, has yet to fully resolve these issues or lead to widespread adoption across the continent.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9653/michael-saylor-predicts-bitcoin-will-hit-21-m-by-2046,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-06-23T05:52:57,"Ethereum steady at $2,500, but could MUTM pull off a 28x before ETH hits $4K?","The latest on-chain data shows that Ethereum (ETH) is holding strong at around $2,500. This stability is driven by various factors, including a recent uptick in network activity. Data shows that around 1 million new ETH addresses have been created a week since the middle of May 2025. That represents a massive increase from the approximately 670,000 new weekly addresses created in the same period last year. This metric indicates a strong underlying network potential for ETH, which has consolidated around $2,500. According to forecasts, the number of new weekly addresses could keep rising by over 30% annually. That signals growing network adoption and wide ecosystem utility. The number of new addresses is widely used in the crypto sector as a signal of long-term adoption and user growth. As a result, analysts are interpreting the data as a sign of bullish momentum for Ethereum. This suggests demand-side strength is quietly lurking below the surface, and could explode at any time. Amid this trend, investors are positioning themselves to benefit from this massive altcoin rally. One way they are doing this is by purchasing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a promising project that is currently in the presale phase. According to projections, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could rise by 2,850% when it goes live. ETH headed To $4K While the market has been rocked by uncertainty, data shows that ETH is doing better than Bitcoin (BTC). This is a rare occurrence as Ethereum (ETH) tends to be closely correlated to Bitcoin (BTC). Before the current Middle East conflict, Ethereum was outperforming Bitcoin, and has since remained steady, despite the massive market shocks. The resilience, coupled with the positive address data, shows that Ethereum could rise higher. As more capital shifts into Ethereum (ETH), analysts forecast that it could trigger a new altcoin rally. Big investors are already positioning themselves to be the main beneficiaries of this expected rally. For instance, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has recently seen an uptick in participation, with over $10.95 million raised in the ongoing presale. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the perfect buy One reason why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has become a favorite of investors amid the pending altcoin rally is its focus on utility. In the past, the forecast has been on meme coins as investors have tried to cash in on the quick gains they offer. However, investors have come to accept that the only way to reliably grow value in the crypto sector is through utility. A good example of this is Ethereum. Since it went live, the price of ETH has risen 89,000%. Best of all, it continues to rise and consolidate those gains because of utility. Additionally, it has high liquidity, which makes it easy for traders to duck in and out of positions to make a profit. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to follow in those footsteps. The project is built as a decentralized non-custodial protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders on the protocol, they can deposit assets in a pool to earn interest. The interest rate in pools is based on the pool utilization rate. As the utilization rate rises and the interest rate rises, it pushes borrowers to repay their loans. At the same time, it pushes lenders to deposit more liquidity in the pools to benefit from the rising rates. That leads to a situation where optimal capital efficiency is achieved. Price discovery on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) For Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to achieve market efficiency, pricing needs to be reliable and always accurate. To achieve this, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will implement Chainlink price data oracles, which are a trusted source of data in the DeFi world. Additionally, they plan to implement backup price oracles to ensure there is always a reliable source of data that is accurate when the primary data source is not working. As a redundancy measure, they will implement both oracles to run concurrently. Additionally, they plan to implement the use of time-weighted price averaging as a reference point when there is enough on-chain volume. This data will be sourced from popular DEXs. The goal is to ensure that price discovery on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fair while ensuring the highest uptime possible. MUTM token presale details The MUTM token presale is currently in phase 5, where over $10.95 million has been raised from over 12,350 unique buyers. The presale has been a massive success, even after the 200% increase in the token to $0.03 from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. So far, 45% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 of the presale have been sold, barely two weeks after they launched. With less than 60% of the tokens remaining in phase 5, this is your last chance to get Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens at a massive 50% off the token listing price of $0.06. Act fast and position yourself to benefit from the upcoming altcoin rally.

2025-06-23T05:25:27,"MSTE:CA: Better Off Owning MSTR Directly, Hold","Summary MSTE offers leveraged exposure to MicroStrategy and monthly income via covered calls, but adds complexity and extra fees versus owning MSTR directly. We remain bullish on Bitcoin and MSTR as a proxy, viewing both as hedges against fiat currency and global instability. The fund's strategy only outperforms within a limited price range for MSTR; outside this, plain MSTR ownership has historically delivered better returns. Given the limited incremental benefit and added risks, we rate MSTE as a hold until clearer value over direct MSTR ownership emerges. Introduction The Harvest MicroStrategy Enhanced High Income Shares ETF (MSTE:CA) is a Canadian fund that aims to invest its assets into Class A shares of MicroStrategy ( MSTR ). This company formerly was a software and business intelligence focused firm, but nowadays is more well known for its Bitcoin dominated balance sheet, due to its large holdings in this cryptocurrency. This fund looks to both provide access to the upside of MSTR while also giving investors consistent income from distributions - paid out monthly. Total leverage of the fund goes up to 25% and its investable units are denominated in CAD. Below are some details of the fund from its prospectus . Distribution : $0.66 / month AUM : $179.3M Management Fee : 0.40% Being that the main holding of this ETF is MSTR, a company that we like due to it being a proxy for Bitcoin, we are inherently bullish on the underlying company. We will review some points above MSTR in the following section that dictate our thoughts about the company. MicroStrategy Company Review MSTR is known for buying and holding Bitcoin (BTC-USD) on its balance sheet. The company has announced a plan to continue buying this cryptocurrency, outlining a long-term plan to continually invest further in Bitcoin through its 42-42 plan by 2027. The firm reveals that the money to fund these purchases would occur through both equity and debt raises, as well as the current operating cash flows generated by the firm itself. This plan entails details such as goals of $42B in equity and $42B in fixed income capital raises by the end of 2027, which should continue to fund its investments in Bitcoin. Furthermore, the company is leveraging its continual offerings of preferred shares , which offer high rates, to attract investors to the company and therefore generate even more cash for them to exchange into Bitcoin. Essentially, MSTR is becoming more and more of a Bitcoin hedge fund in a sense, where investors can view their investments in MSTR as a bullish play on Bitcoin (and crypto markets in general). Currently, MSTR holds a total of 592,100 Bitcoins , with an average BTC cost of ~$70,666. In nominal values, they have spent roughly $42B on their Bitcoin purchases over the years. The following chart shows the buying cadence (every week) and amount bought for YTD 2025. MSTR Bitcoin Purchases ( MicroStrategy ) We view MSTR as a great hedge against fiat currencies and also as a stable hedge against chaos happening across the world today. For example, the firm recently bought more BTC during the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, betting that the conflict and funding for it might boost the price of BTC. Ultimately, an investment in MSTR means that you have faith and believe in the market changing dynamics of Bitcoin. It may be that you view it as a hedge, truly do not believe in the current traditional finance systems, or a bit of both. Either way, Bitcoin’s influence on global financial markets cannot be understated and should be respected as an asset with both utility (in terms of transactions) and a hedge (against fiat currencies and as a store of value). It should be mentioned, however, that MSTR as a holding company of BTC frequently trades at a premium in terms of performance compared to buying BTC outright. Look at the below chart, for example, comparing YTD returns on BTC and MSTR. MSTR vs BTC YTD Performance (Yahoo Finance) The top blue represents MSTR, and BTC is the red line. With nearly a ~19% delta in YTD performance, one has to consider whether MSTR is an overvalued way to gain exposure to the underlying BTC asset. Either way, it would appear that the market places a premium on the leader, Michael Saylor, and his vision of what MSTR can do with their vast BTC holdings. In summary, we are bullish on the future of BTC, and therefore, MSTR. With this ETF holding MSTR and providing stable, recurring income from it, we also are therefore bullish on the future of this fund. However, there are risks and considerations stemming from the leverage and covered call elements of the fund that we will cover in the next section. Covered Calls and Leverage MSTE utilizes both leveraged and covered calls in order to increase overall returns for investors. Their goal is to have the fund be up to 25% leveraged and write covered calls on up to 50% of the fund . Currently, the fund is 22.8% leveraged . For the purpose of this analysis, we assume the fund is split up like so: 25% is 2x leveraged. For now, we assume that there is no interest cost related to the leveraging 50% is not leveraged but has covered calls written against it 25% just owns MSTE directly Let’s explore a scenario: The fund owns 200 shares of MSTR that were bought at $100 per share. 50 additional shares were bought on leverage. The fund has sold covered calls on 100 shares at a strike price of $125 for total proceeds of $500 Scenario Description Gain/Loss on MSTR Gain/Loss on Option Total Gain/Loss Without Leverage/Options No movement MSTR does not move at all. $0 $500 $500 $0 Mildly Up MSTR ends up at a price of $110 $2,500 $500 $3,000 $2,000 Mildly Down MSTR ends up at a price of $90 -$2,500 $500 -$2,000 -$2,000 Very Up MSTR ends up at a price of $160 $11,500 ($2,500 on covered call shares, $9,000 on the rest) $500 $12,000 $12,000 Very Down MSTR ends up at a price of $50 -$12,500 $500 -$12,000 -$10,000 It’s hard to see exactly how the leverage and options impact returns, as they sometimes impact the returns in the same direction (positive or negative) and sometimes have an opposite (but not always equal) impact. A few rules of thumb: If the stock price remains at or below the strike price, then the covered call strategy will result in higher returns (compared to if you did not sell the calls). If the stock price goes above the strike price, then investors will see positive returns, but the returns would be higher if you had not sold the calls. Leverage amplifies both gains and losses. So if the stock price increases, you make more profit but if the stock price decreases you make less profit (both relative to a non-leveraged scenario). Let’s talk about the “Very Up” strategy. In the above scenario, the returns from having the covered calls and leverage are the same as if you had not done either. This is because the covered calls are decreasing potential returns by $3,000 while the leverage is increasing potential returns by $3,000. To be clear, these impacts will not always be equal. If instead the scenario was that the stock increased to $170, the total returns would be $13,000 while returns without leverage/options would be $14,000. MSTE gains with and without leverage/options (Doodad Capital) Above is a chart that visualizes the overall scenario. There are 3 main sections: $0 - $90: Investors are better off without the calls + leverage $90 - $160: Investors are better off using the calls + leverage $160+: Investors are better off without the calls + leverage So why are $90 and $160 the two points where the outcome flips? These are both points where the red and blue lines are exactly the same. This is because the negative impacts of leveraging are exactly canceled out by positive impacts of the calls (for the $90 case) or the positive impacts of leveraging are exactly canceled out by negative impacts of the calls (for the $160 case). These intersection points will change depending on various factors such as the call strike price, premium and interest costs of the leverage. For example, if instead the premium from selling the call was $1000, the intersection points would instead be at $80 and $170 instead. The key takeaway here is that investors in this kind of strategy would ideally see the stock price stay between the 2 intersection points. Otherwise, they would have larger returns without the additional call options and leverage. Finally, let’s talk about leverage interest. Since leveraging is a kind of debt, there will be an additional interest cost related to it. In this scenario, we borrowed enough cash to buy 50 shares of MSTR at $100 per share, resulting in a total debt of $5,000. The easy way to think about impacts of interest is that it changes the width of the range between the 2 intersection points. More interest would mean a narrower range, while less interest would result in a wider range. For example, with additional interest of $500, the range narrows from $90 - $160 to $100 - $150. Risks A key risk is BTC volatility. Being a cryptocurrency, it can sometimes be very volatile, as we all know. Therefore, the price of MSTR could also be impacted by swings in the price of BTC, as they are now so tied together. With a beta of 3.76 , this is a name that moves significantly compared to the market. This would be a risk that investors should keep in mind regarding the stability of their portfolio, and could therefore be a trade for more risk-tolerant investors. Another risk to consider is the additional cost of owning this ETF. Investors pay additional management fees as well as indirectly the leverage interest fees. All of this is fine if the returns outweigh the costs, but investors need to weigh the additional cost/complexity against the additional potential return they could gain. As we discussed, investors in this kind of strategy only make a profit if the share price ends up within a certain range, which limits the overall benefit of the fund. As you can see below, since inception, MSTE has actually lagged behind MSTR in returns by ~2% (the below chart is dividend adjusted, so proceeds from the covered call strategy are included). Investors could have saved on fees and the additional complexity by just buying MSTR instead. MSTR vs MSTE Returns (Stock Rover) Finally, we should also mention that while this fund is not very highly levered, it does have some leverage which could pose an additional risk. With leveraged investments, your losses could quickly compound, leading to potentially very large losses. Conclusion We are bullish on the future of BTC as we view it as a hedge against the traditional financial markets and as a safe haven in the event of conflicts around the world. Despite the risks and volatility associated with BTC, long-term, we believe that the currency will rise. For MSTE, it is interesting to see dual-features of it, offering both upside potential via leverage and recurring income via covered calls. However, we are not convinced if this additional complexity is providing enough value back to investors given the maintenance fee. The additional returns from the strategy are limited to only a specific window of price movement for MSTR and, as we showed, so far, investors would have been better off just owning MSTR. Until we see more evidence of incremental benefit from MSTE, we rate it as a hold.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4796441-msteca-better-off-owning-mstr-directly-hold?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","MSTR|BTC-USD|MSTE:CA",cryptocompare
2025-06-23T05:24:07,"Pi Network News: Nicolas Kokkalis Breaks Silence on Pi Coin Price Drop","The post Pi Network News: Nicolas Kokkalis Breaks Silence on Pi Coin Price Drop appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market faced sharp losses over the weekend, dragged down by rising Middle East tensions and inflation fears. Bitcoin slipped below $99,000, with Ethereum and other major altcoins following suit. Pi Coin also plunged 11%, nearing its all-time low, before a slight 0.55% rebound today. June’s 263 million token unlock continues to weigh heavily on Pi’s price , fueling selling pressure and investor concerns. Why Is #PiNetwork Price Low Right Now? Will It Rise Again? Global crypto correction is hitting all major coins — not just Pi. #Bitcoin , #Ethereum & #Solana have dipped recently, dragging the market sentiment down. When these giants fall, the whole market feels it.… pic.twitter.com/8f48DaHzCV — Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis (@drnicolas_) June 22, 2025 However, Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis , the founder of Pi Network, has responded to concerns about the falling Pi price, attributing it to the broader crypto market correction. He pointed out that major assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana have also seen notable declines, impacting the overall market mood. So, Pi’s dip isn’t an isolated event, but it could be a part of a global trend. Temporary Dip, Long-Term Vision According to him, despite the bloodbath, Pi Network stands out with a unique setup. The project is in its Enclosed Mainnet phase, meaning it isn’t yet publicly tradable. Despite that, Kokkalis emphasized strong fundamentals, including over 50 million users, a growing ecosystem of real-world applications , and steady development. He reassured the Pi community, known as Pioneers, that what’s happening isn’t a crash but a transitional phase. Kokkalis believes the token’s true value will emerge once the Open Mainnet launches and Pi is listed on major exchanges. He framed the current situation as an accumulation phase, often misunderstood as weakness. For now, he urges users to stay patient and focused, noting that utility-based growth is already underway. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Network Founder Slammed as ‘Scammer’ for Defending Price Crash; He Responds , Analyst says, Prices to Stay Low Pi is officially in the $0.4 range, and I expect it to remain there until the end of August. Pi Day 2 is unlikely to have any impact. @PiCoreTeam @nkokkalis @Chengdiao pic.twitter.com/KUBKw7pCzM — Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin) June 22, 2025 Crypto analyst Dr. Altcoin predicts that Pi Coin will stay around the $0.40 level through the end of August. He believes the upcoming Pi Day 2 event is unlikely to influence the price, signaling low expectations for short-term momentum despite community buzz. What next? Much of the hype surrounds June 28, which marks Pi Day 2 and the conclusion of the .pi domain auction. Over 123,000 active bids have sparked optimism about ecosystem growth. While the Core Team hasn’t confirmed any updates, the market is anticipating something. Historically, Pi has rallied around such events, as seen with its 175% jump in May. However, caution remains due to the July 1 unlock of 40 million PI tokens, which could weigh on prices. For now, Pi is showing signs of strength, briefly decoupling from Bitcoin’s broader decline, driven by technical support and event-driven momentum. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Over the past week, Bitcoin has fluctuated with traders closely monitoring geopolitical developments and on-chain data, such as short-term holders selling at a loss and liquidity clustering near $106K, for signs of a decisive breakout. While Bitcoin hasn’t acted as a traditional safe haven amid the crisis, its stability amid risk-off conditions suggests possible accumulation beneath the surface. Amid this backdrop of moderate volatility and macro uncertainty, all eyes are turning toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance official presale has the token set at $0.03 in Phase 5. Already 200% higher since presale went live, Mutuum Finance will launch at $0.06 officially, giving current buyers a minimum return on investment of 100%.

This rewards long-term holding, domesticates volatility in the market, and makes the token’s value, so long-term dedicated investors enjoy a stupendous advantage in the long run. Stablecoin release and CertiK auditing grant institutional legitimacy Mutuum Finance’s much-anticipated launch of a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum is one of the steady solid pillars in this vision. It’s designed to endure market cycles and provide a stable alternative to failed algorithmic stablecoins that destabilized previous DeFi ecosystems.

2025-06-23T04:47:48,"Bitcoin Holds Key Support; Oil Disappoints 'Doomers' as Brent and WTI Erase Early Price Gains","American poet Charles Bukowski famously said: ""The crowd is always wrong,"" and his words seem to sum up the situation in the financial markets perfectly. Just 24 hours ago, social media was abuzz with fears that the U.S. airstrike on Iran's nuclear sites, combined with the talk of Iran mulling the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, will trigger a massive surge in oil prices, leading to a slide in stocks and cryptocurrencies. The reality, however, has turned out to be different. Oil prices on both sides of the Atlantic gapped higher by just 3% and have since erased most of the gains, according to data source TradingView. As of writing, a barrel of Brent oil changed hands at $77, up just 1.4% for the day. Prices gapped higher to hit a five-month high of $77.79. Similarly, the West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) hit a high of $78.58 before falling back to $76.75. Meanwhile, bitcoin BTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has risen back above $101,000, having hit lows under $98,000 on Sunday when fears of an oil price spike led to the short-term Deribit-listed BTC puts trading at an 8%-10% volatility premium to calls. Futures tied to the S&P 500 traded just 0.3% lower. The largely muted reaction in oil prices suggests that the market doesn't expect Iran to follow through on its threats and block the Strait of Hormuz, which could destabilize its key allies in Asia, particularly China. ""Price action this morning suggests that the market doesn’t believe (at least not yet) that flows through Hormuz will be blocked. Brent is back below $80/bbl after briefly spiking above this level earlier in the trading session,"" analysts at ING said in a report to clients Monday. ""With more than 80% of oil flows through Hormuz ending up in Asia, the impact on the region would be larger than that on the US. Therefore, Iran would want to be careful in upsetting the likes of China by disrupting oil flows,"" ING added. According to energy market expert Anas Alhajji, Iran's threat to close the Strait is largely a rhetorical tactic for domestic consumption, which it has employed at least 15 times since the 1980s. Alhajji explained the same in a post on X , revisiting the 2018 thread that detailed how blocking the strait is easier said than done. ""For Iran to close the Strait, it means occupation and the taking over of Oman's waters where most ships go through. This will immediately invoke the defence pact of the GCC: it means war among all,"" the thread said, adding that a potential closure would hurt Iran's friends more than its enemies, which do not import oil from Iran and could circumvent the Strait through two underutilized pipelines. BTC holds key support All this means that the much-feared oil price spike may not materialize soon, which could help BTC and other risk assets avoid a sell-off. A big surge in oil would increase the risk of major economies slipping into stagflation, the worst outcome for most assets, including bitcoin. BTC's chart shows that bears failed to establish a foothold below the horizontal support at $100,430 on Sunday. Buyers stepped in around that level on June 5, taking prices higher to $110,000 in subsequent days. Oil's muted reaction suggests the potential for history to repeat itself. On the flip side, acceptance under the support would shift the focus to the confluence of the 100- and 200-day simple moving averages at around $95,900.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/23/bitcoin-holds-key-support-oil-disappoints-doomers-as-brent-and-wti-erase-early-price-gains,"ASIA|BTC|COMMODITY|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Oil|Markets|Iran|News",cryptocompare
