In a new filing with the Office of the Maine Attorney General, the Michigan-based McLaren Health Care says 743,131 Americans are impacted by a major cybersecurity incident. The firm says an unknown threat actor gained access to McLaren’s database and stole patient information, which may include names, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, medical histories and health insurance records. “On or about August 5, 2024, McLaren became aware of suspicious activity related to certain McLaren/Karmanos computer systems and they immediately activated their emergency response processes. Additionally, McLaren launched an investigation with the assistance of third-party forensic specialists to secure their network and to determine the nature and scope of the activity. Through the investigation, it was determined that there was unauthorized access to the network between July 17, 2024, and August 3, 2024. As part of the investigation, McLaren undertook an extensive forensic review of the potentially impacted files to determine whether any sensitive information was present. It was through this process, which concluded on May 5, 2025, that McLaren determined that personal information and protected health information pertaining to individuals was contained within the files involved.” McLaren is a $7.3 billion health care delivery system that oversees 12 hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and imaging centers along with a network of primary and specialty care doctors. The firm says it sent letters of notification to patients affected by the data breach, while offering free credit monitoring services through IDX for 12 months. For now, McLaren says that it is reviewing its security protocols and implementing additional technical safeguards to avoid a potential repeat of the incident.

2025-06-23T16:43:38,"How Ben Armstrong turned BitBoy crypto into a brand — then lost it all","How did Ben Armstrong turn BitBoy Crypto into one of the loudest voices in crypto, and what finally caused the persona, platform, and man behind it to unravel? Table of Contents Crypto’s loudest voice, silenced by the law The rise of a retail-friendly influencer Bitboy’s reputation in freefall The cost of staying relevant Crypto’s loudest voice, silenced by the law In March 2025, Ben Armstrong, known widely as BitBoy Crypto, became the focus of a legal and reputational collapse that had been building over several years. Once among the most prominent figures in crypto media, Armstrong is now in custody at the Volusia County Branch Jail in Florida, facing felony charges tied to written threats against a sitting judge. As of June 2025, court records indicate that his case remains unresolved, with a psychiatric evaluation delaying his bail hearing until early July. The arrest was formally logged on Mar. 25 and confirmed the next day through a statement issued by the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office. Local coverage from multiple outlets verified the report in a live broadcast. Four days before his arrest, Armstrong had publicly acknowledged the warrant in a post on X, saying he was “facing a warrant but fighting for justice.” I can now confirm that the warrants for my arrest are due to me sending emails (as my own attorney by the way) to the DISHONORABLE Kimberly Childs of @cobbcountygovt who has NOW DELETED her Twitter lmao. Public officials hiding corruption one day at a time. — The BitBoy (@BenArmstrongsX) March 21, 2025 Unsealed court documents from Georgia show that Armstrong is being prosecuted under Florida Statute 836.10, facing two felony counts for making written threats to kill or injure. The threats were reportedly directed at Judge Kimberly Childs of Cobb County’s Superior Court. Each charge carries a potential prison sentence of 5 to 10 years. The ongoing situation has also attracted regulatory attention. In June 2024, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued a subpoena to HIT Network, Armstrong’s former media employer. The agency is investigating undisclosed token promotions, including Armstrong’s personal involvement in multiple memecoins, that took place between 2021 and 2023. Despite Armstrong’s detention, updates continue to appear on his official X account. His team has been posting messages encouraging followers to share support. A pinned post dated Jun. 7 invited the public to send letters of encouragement as legal proceedings continue. If anyone would like to include a positive message to Ben in a letter please comment it below. Thank you 🙏 — The BitBoy (@BenArmstrongsX) June 6, 2025 The rise of a retail-friendly influencer Armstrong’s involvement in crypto dates back to October 2012, when he purchased 0.5 Bitcoin ( BTC ) at $12.50 per coin. He later referenced this early purchase in a 2019 post on X, identifying it as his entry point into the crypto space. Before turning to crypto full-time, he operated a digital marketing business under the name Ben Armstrong Designs. During the same period, he worked with a rehabilitation center in Atlanta called Three Dimensional Life. The transition into crypto content creation began in April 2018 with the launch of the BitBoy Crypto YouTube channel. The platform grew steadily and surpassed 1 million subscribers by early 2022. Viewer engagement was consistently high, with estimated monthly watch hours reaching over 1.5 million. Armstrong expanded his presence by partnering with a range of blockchain companies, including promotional deals with Binance and several smaller crypto projects. His content strategy combined daily market updates, token reviews, and sponsored videos, distributed across platforms such as X and Telegram. The model reflected the rise of the influencer economy in crypto, where visibility and reach translated directly into revenue opportunities. During this period, Armstrong’s public image remained largely positive. His consistent posting schedule and beginner-friendly tone helped him build a loyal audience, positioning him as a familiar voice in an increasingly crowded content space. Bitboy’s reputation in freefall Concerns about Armstrong’s business practices began to surface more prominently in early 2023. In March, a Reddit post leaked what appeared to be his promotional rate card. The post alleged that Armstrong charged $40,000 for YouTube reviews, $20,000 for mentions on X, and $10,000 for Telegram promotions. The leak renewed scrutiny around several crypto projects he had promoted, many of which later collapsed or faced regulatory action. These included DISTX, which shut down in May 2023 with reported investor losses of $1.2 million; HEX, labeled a Ponzi scheme by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in June 2023; and SAFEMOON, which was charged with fraud by U.S. regulators in November 2023. On-chain data from Etherscan also showed that insider wallets moved 8 million SAFEMOON tokens shortly after Armstrong publicly endorsed the project. In June 2023, Armstrong launched his own meme token called BEN. The token reached a peak price of $0.000011 by July 1 but declined to around $0.0000067 by the end of the year, a loss of more than 85%. Data from Nansen indicated that 12.3 million tokens were offloaded by early holders during the downturn. In August 2023, blockchain researcher ZachXBT published an investigation detailing millions in undisclosed promotional payments tied to Armstrong. 1/ Let’s review all the direct scams Bitboy has worked with in the past. Just in case you forgot here is the flyer with how much he charges. I received this a while back by posing as a project interested in a promotion. 🧵 👇 pic.twitter.com/FkC9HUDGsc — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) January 3, 2022 The report highlighted two projects, MYX and LOCK, both of which were abandoned within weeks of promotion. Investor losses from those two alone were estimated at over $1 million, based on data compiled by community analysts. Armstrong’s role at HIT Network officially ended in August 2023. An internal memo cited gross misconduct, referencing a July incident during which he appeared visibly intoxicated while livestreaming. Subscriber data from Social Blade showed a loss of 150,000 followers in the week that followed. Financial records later leaked to the media showed a revenue decline from $500,000 per month in 2022 to $50,000 by November 2023. In December 2024, reports stated that Armstrong owed HIT Network $250,000 in outstanding obligations. The cost of staying relevant Between early 2024 and early 2025, Ben Armstrong’s public and private life became increasingly unstable, shaped by legal pressure, financial strain, and growing media exposure. In February 2024, he participated in a boxing match in Mexico City during a Karate Combat event, where he faced off against memecoin promoter Carlos “More Light” Rodriguez. The event attracted attention on X and triggered rapid price fluctuations in several tokens. BEN briefly surged by nearly 90%, while HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu dropped over 20% within hours. Both tokens saw steep declines shortly afterward. Combined, they lost several million dollars in market value within days. In March 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued a public advisory warning investors about the risks of influencer-led token events and short-term promotional campaigns. Armstrong’s personal challenges deepened during this period. In January 2025, his divorce was finalized in Fulton County, Georgia, following a year-long separation. Court documents showed $180,000 in unpaid alimony and child support. A GoFundMe campaign launched in December 2024 raised $14,800 from 1,350 donors, citing legal and medical expenses as its purpose. Legal issues escalated in March 2025, when Armstrong was arrested outside his partner’s residence in Deltona, Florida. Law enforcement records described a domestic dispute. He was charged in a separate case involving felony threats against a judge. What began as a well-timed entry into Bitcoin for Armstrong eventually grew into a multi-million-dollar media platform. Over time, the pressure to remain visible overtook the motivations that once grounded his work. Promotions became entangled with financial risk, content blurred into personal conflict, and public trust eroded under mounting legal and reputational damage. In the end, Armstrong’s story is less about crypto misadventures and more about what influence without restraint can become in an ecosystem still learning where its boundaries should be.",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/the-rise-and-fall-of-bitboy-crypto-ben-armstrong/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING","Feature|Influencers|Twitter",cryptocompare

The facility is expected to become BUZZ HPC’s first Tier 3 data center. It will be upgraded to support liquid cooling and host up to 5,000 next-generation GPUs, enabling large-scale AI model training and inference. The company says the infrastructure will also support Canadian enterprise and government workloads, reinforcing the country's digital sovereignty. “With the explosion of demand for HPC and AI compute capacity, this Toronto site gives us a critical footprint to develop a sovereign AI data center — owned and operated in Canada by a Canadian public company — ensuring data residency, security, and national innovation leadership,” said Craig Tavares, president and chief operating officer of BUZZ HPC. The move comes amid a global race to build national AI infrastructure, with countries vying for compute capacity to keep up with the breakneck pace of generative AI development. The acquisition also signals BUZZ HPC’s first major step into operating its own facility. HIVE, which started as a crypto mining company, continues to shift toward AI and cloud services, with a particular focus on renewable-powered infrastructure.

(@Metaplanet_JP) June 23, 2025 Balance Sheet Swells to 11,111 BTC With the new purchase, Metaplanet’s total stash now stands at 11,111 BTC, worth just over $1.07 billion. Its cost basis for those coins sits at about $95,869 each. Metaplanet’s shares dipped 3.5% on the day of the announcement, a sign that investors may be worried about how the firm is funding its buy-ups. Source: Metaplanet Funding Through Bonds And Shares Based on reports, the company has raised cash via zero-coupon bonds and equity rights since January. It issued over 210 million shares under a program it calls the “210 Million Plan.” Evo Fund has snapped up many of those bonds and rights. Between May and June 2025, Metaplanet pulled in over $300 million, earmarking every dollar for more Bitcoin. Ambitious Target Of 210,000 BTC Metaplanet has set a goal to hold 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. That is 10 times its current pile. To reach that number, it will need to keep tapping the capital markets—and it plans to. The firm even created a dedicated Bitcoin Treasury Operations arm in December 2024, moving away from its hotel management roots. Related Reading: Stablecoin Wars Ignite: Peter Schiff Champions Gold-Backed Digital Assets Dilution And Risk For Shareholders Metaplanet’s fully diluted share count rose to close to 760 million as of June 23. That puts its Bitcoin per 1,000 shares at 0.0146 BTC. More bonds and shares mean more dilution for existing investors. If Bitcoin’s price slips, the cost of raising money could climb, eating into any gains from the crypto itself. Metaplanet’s approach mirrors what some other big holders have done. It’s a bold stance. If Bitcoin holds up or heads higher, the firm could see big returns. But it will need to balance fresh capital raises against the risk of pushing down its own stock. For now, Metaplanet shows no sign of slowing down its Bitcoin buying. The only real question is how far this strategy can run before the bills come due.

2025-06-23T16:27:42,"IP crypto price jumps 12%: can bulls drive it to $4.17 and beyond?","Story price is showing strong signs of a potential trend reversal after an 11.83% surge. Key support at $3.12 is holding, with oversold RSI and rising volume pointing to more upside. After an extended correction, Story ( IP ) has finally shown a meaningful bounce, climbing 11.83% and reclaiming a crucial resistance level. The current market structure suggests the bottom may be in, especially with volume surging and RSI exiting oversold territory. Price action has now broken above $3.12, a region aligned with the point of control and prior high timeframe resistance. As long as price holds this level, the door remains open for a continued rally toward $4.17, and possibly higher. Key technical points: Key Support Level: $3.12; in confluence with point of control and local breakout Next Resistance Target: $4.17; followed by $4.90 as an extended bullish target Oversold RSI: Now exiting extreme levels, signaling momentum recovery Volume Behavior: Recent surge in volume at support confirms buyer presence and potential bottom IP (1D) chart, source: TradingView From a technical perspective, the swing low was formed at the value area low of the recent corrective move. This area aligned closely with high timeframe support at $2.61, which held across multiple daily candle closes, suggesting accumulation at the base. The follow-through came with an impulsive breakout candle, pushing price above $3.12 and confirming a short-term shift in trend. The $3.12 region is significant. Not only does it align with the point of control, but it has also transitioned from resistance into potential support. If price continues to close above this level on high volume, it would confirm strength in the move and raise the probability of a breakout continuation. Read more: Here’s why the XRP price may crash below $1 soon The RSI has also been deeply oversold throughout the downtrend and is now showing signs of recovery. Combined with the surge in volume at support, in stark contrast to the low-volume grind during the downtrend, this signals that demand has returned. The next resistance sits at $4.17, a natural target for the current leg. A move to this level would represent a further 32% gain from current prices. If bullish momentum remains, $4.90 becomes the next macro target, with the potential for a full trend rotation. What to expect in the coming price action If IP continues to close above $3.12 with strong volume, a rally toward $4.17 looks increasingly likely. Watch for consolidation or impulsive continuation in this zone, both will reveal the next major move.

2025-06-23T16:22:44,"Veda locks $18m to push vault-based DeFi beyond the crypto bubble","DeFi’s complexity has long been a barrier to mainstream adoption. Veda, which hit $3.5 billion in TVL within eight months by abstracting that complexity, just raised $18 million to scale its vault system across a broader class of financial platforms. On June 23, DeFi infrastructure firm Veda announced an $18 million funding round led by CoinFund, with participation from Coinbase Ventures, Animoca Ventures, GSR, Mantle EcoFund, BitGo, Draper Dragon, and other heavyweight investors. https://twitter.com/veda_labs/status/1937130381465039310 The capital injection comes as Veda sharpens its focus beyond crypto-native ecosystems, aiming to embed its vault-based infrastructure into a wider range of financial platforms. Since its early 2024 launch, the infrastructure provider’s modular vault system has gained traction, processing deposits from over 100,000 users and integrating with dozens of protocols. Its vault framework, which abstracts the complexity of DeFi yield generation, is now being positioned as core infrastructure for wallets, fintech apps, and exchanges. You might also like: Strategy adds to $60b Bitcoin bet with 245 BTC bought at $105.9k Rewriting DeFi’s playbook for mainstream finance Veda’s rapid ascent to $3.5 billion in total value locked reveals a fundamental truth about DeFi’s next phase: the winning protocols won’t be those that shout the loudest, but those that mask complexity the most effectively. The startup’s vault system operates like a financial API layer, handling cross-chain yield strategies, risk management, and execution while allowing integrated platforms, such as DeFi protocols and traditional fintech apps, to present users with a familiar interface. The idea is simple: let the app control the user experience, while Veda handles the backend complexity that DeFi typically exposes. At its core, Veda’s technology standardizes yield-bearing activities, such as staking, restaking, and liquidity provisioning, into modular smart contracts that apps can plug into without rebuilding the wheel. This explains why protocols like Ether.fi and Mantle have adopted its vaults as foundational components rather than competitive products. The vaults’ interoperability has turned them into a shared primitive, similar to how AWS became the invisible backbone for web applications. Veda’s goal isn’t to make DeFi more visible. It’s to render it invisible. For developers, that means fewer maintenance and composability headaches. For platforms, it means scalable, yield-generating features that don’t require educating users on the risks of DeFi or bridging across chains. And for users, it could mean earning yield or staking rewards through the same interfaces they already trust.

2025-06-23T16:19:44,"Bitcoin Dominance Peaks at New Local High: Are Altcoins Doomed?","Holding altcoins has generally been the kiss of death for most investors this crypto cycle. While Bitcoin (BTC) has stood firm through the most difficult of geopolitical and economic headwinds, the altcoins have been hit hard just about every time. Is there any way back for alts, or will the institutional money ignore them and continue to heavily back $BTC? Bitcoin Dominance just continues up and to the right Source: TradingView The Bitcoin Dominance chart (BTC.D) reveals that dominance has been moving up and to the right since September 2022. Having just made yet another local high, dominance is currently knocking on the door of the 65.6% resistance. Once and if this is breached, the next resistances are at 68% and 70.3%, with 73.6% marking a new macro higher high. Looking to the future, many investors must be beginning to wonder if the combined altcoin market will ever be able to take the limelight from Bitcoin for any extended period of time, like it did in the past. Total3 at critical support Source: TradingView Given the woes of Ethereum, the Total3 chart can provide some clues as to how the altcoins could perform over the next week or so. It can be seen that Total3 is at a very critical juncture. The support at $775 billion is absolutely crucial for the bulls to hold, and is bolstered by the top of a previous bull flag. However, if Total3 should fall through here, $670 billion would be the next major support level. Will $SOL fall through the last major support? Source: TradingView A key canary in the coal mine for the altcoins is $SOL , given that the Solana blockchain is responsible for the vast majority of transactions across all major altcoin networks. It can be seen in the weekly chart for $SOL that the price has sunk into the very strong and critical band of support that stretches down to $125. With the Stochastic RSI indicator lines heading downwards, the price may well fall through this last major support and head down to $100, and even possibly down to $75. That said, if $BTC is able to turn things around, which is quite likely given that the bull market cycle has probably not finished, the maxim of “lifting all boats” would most certainly apply to $SOL, giving this layer 1 leader the potential to rise back to its previous highs.

2025-06-23T16:00:00,"Ethereum (ETH) Mirrors Bitcoin’s 2017–2021 Pattern with $4,000 in Sight as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Gears Up to Make Early Backers Rich","Ethereum’s recent price movement has analysts drawing parallels to Bitcoin’s historic 2017–2021 rally, and while ETH flirts with a possible breakout toward $4,000, the real conversation is beginning to shift. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising DeFi protocol still in its early presale phase, is rapidly emerging as a potential game-changer and is already being watched by seasoned crypto investors looking for the next big cryptocurrency before it hits the mainstream radar. At present, Mutuum Finance has sold out over 40% of phase-5 of its presale. The project has already received more than 11 million and has drawn close to 12,300 investors. Ethereum Echoes Bitcoin’s 2017–2021 Consolidation as $4,000 Lurks Ethereum is now sitting at 2,553 and looks exactly like the classic pres-parabolic configuration in 2017-2021 on Bitcoin. According to renowned analyst Ted Pillows and others, what has now occurred is that ETH has wrapped into a small trade range and is being held at $2,400-2,600 as an initial support leading to possible breakout at higher values above the 2,800-2,775 range. An action through that level may trigger an imminent rise to the $4,000 ceiling, rejuvenating the altcoin market activity. Nonetheless, this bullish situation might be postponed by macro uncertainties, which cover both geopolitical and economic levels. Making this wait even more tense is a muttered, little known player: Mutuum Finance (MUTM), who has managed to attract new interest of early-stage investors. Mutuum Finance is Reinventing DeFi Lending, using a Dual-Model System Mutuum Finance is set to establish a new standard in decentralized finance and introduce the next-generation lending protocol to offer the best of both worlds, combining the Profits of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. Within the P2C system, lending pool and interest rate auto-update to reflect the current market trends through the intervention of automated smart contracts. This will offer a stable and predictable set of returns to lenders and consistent set of terms to borrowers, which is sorely lacking in DeFi lending. The P2P model, on the contrary, eliminates middlemen, which enables borrowers and lenders to access each other. The model is particularly beneficial in handling highly volatile assets and it gives its users more flexibility, control and risk management that suits their needs. Combining two effective solutions, Mutuum Finance offers an incomparable balance of efficiency, decentralization, and flexibility and will become a leader of the DeFi market in the future. Presale Phase 5 Accelerates Mutuum Finance presale is currently at Phase 5 and the momentum is gaining pace rapidly. Having over 12,300 investors who have joined already, and with almost 11 million already raised, the project is demonstrating that it is not just another DeFi experiment. Smart investors can’t miss a chance to purchase Mutuum Finance tokens with a price of just $0.03, which are set to increase and be $0.06 at launch, leading to a 2x yield on investments in the early phase. Mutuum Finance is designing an Ethereum-based fully collateralized USD stablecoin to complement its ecosystem even more. The asset is stable in volatile markets unlike algorithmic stablecoins that are vulnerable to depegging in volatile markets environments; therefore, making it a stable medium of exchange and store value institutionally and retail-wise. Ethereum’s march toward $4,000 has traders buzzing, but behind the scenes, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly setting the stage for even greater gains. With over 12,300 investors and $11 million raised so far in Phase 5, the token is priced at just $0.03, yet offers a 2x return by launch. Mutuum’s dual lending system, stablecoin integration, and real DeFi utility make it more than a presale hype. As ETH prepares for its next leg up, MUTM may be the real wealth builder for early backers looking to multiply their returns before 2026.

BTC, ETH, XRP, and Pi Network Bounce Back Strong appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After a nerve-wracking weekend packed with geopolitical tension and market dips, the crypto market is showing fresh signs of life. The crypto market’s turnaround comes after Bitcoin briefly dipped below $100,000 amid fears surrounding U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The Middle East conflict sent shockwaves across financial markets, but Bitcoin managed to hold key support levels and has since climbed back above $101,000. The overall crypto market is showing signs of recovery, with the total market cap climbing to $3.12 trillion — up 2.42% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin continues to lead the market, trading above $101,400 with a 5.7% gain over the past week. Ethereum follows with a solid 14.6% weekly rise, while altcoins like XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano are posting double-digit weekly gains. Hyperliquid (HYPE) surged over 22% this week, cementing its spot among the top performers. Despite the bounce, Altcoin Season Index remains low at 15/100 — suggesting Bitcoin dominance still rules this rally for now. One of the biggest confidence boosters for Bitcoin was news that MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor purchased a staggering $1 billion worth of BTC, adding to institutional optimism. This heavyweight buyout set off a chain reaction, with altcoins like ETH, XRP, ADA, DOT, and Pi Network all catching a bid. With geopolitical fears cooling slightly and options expiries out of the way, crypto markets are stabilizing for now. But with macro risks still looming and ETF developments on the radar, traders are advised to stay alert while enjoying this bounce.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-is-the-crypto-market-going-up-today-btc-eth-xrp-and-pi-network-bounce-back-strong/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|XRP","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news",cryptocompare

Sonic was recently formed by rebranding the well-established altcoin Sonic. Sonic has started to rise noticeably since the evening hours today. Although there was a recovery atmosphere in the cryptocurrency market in general today, the increase in the S price was recorded as 14% and left many altcoins behind. There was no sudden increase after the Coinbase listing news. In fact, there was a controversy between Sonic founder Andre Cronje and Coinbase in the past. Cronje claimed that Coinbase did not charge fees for listings, but the company demanded fees of $100 million or more for the priority of listings. Similarly, Tron founder Justin Sun previously claimed that Coinbase required an $80 million fee and $250 million in Bitcoin collateral to list TRX. Coinbase, however, continues to insist that there are no fees for listings. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-23T15:48:09,"Middle East Crisis Hits Bitcoin: What Should We Expect Next for BTC? Fall or Rise? Analysts Comment!","Bitcoin price rose above $100,000 again in early May after a long correction. However, BTC fell below $100,000 for the first time since early May following the US-Iran developments over the weekend. While this decline is only temporary according to some analysts, according to others, the decline could deepen if critical levels are not maintained. At this point, experienced analyst 10x Research founder Markus Thielen said that Bitcoin's fall or rise depends on some levels. Explaining the critical levels for Bitcoin, the analyst said that as long as BTC remains above the short-term realized price of $98,000 and the trend support of $102,000, there is a chance for an increase and investors can continue to look for tactical bullish opportunities. However, the analyst warned investors against this situation and stated that a break below this range is very likely, especially in the absence of strong bullish catalysts. Stating that investors should manage their risks, the analyst said: “BTC has made three failed attempts to break above $110,000 due to short-term macroeconomic shocks, from tariff concerns in May to the escalation between Israel and Iran in June. At this point, Bitcoin has been in a consolidation phase for the last five weeks, and these events show that it is not behaving as a hedge in the current environment.” Stating that Bitcoin is too risky, Thielen said that the consolidation could last a few more months and said, “Our view is that we will consolidate throughout the summer.” Bitcoin's Uptrend Continues! While Thielen is not bullish on Bitcoin, Eugene Cheung, director of digital asset platform OSL, noted that despite Bitcoin briefly falling below $100,000, its resistance points to strong institutional support. “Even though Bitcoin has fallen below $100,000 due to increased geopolitical tensions following the US strike on Iran, it has remained resilient. This indicates strong institutional support and long-term optimism,” Cheung said, remaining bullish. Finally, LVRG Research analyst Nick Ruck argued that altcoins could outperform Bitcoin in the coming months. Ruck said that if macro conditions stabilize, catalysts for crypto could emerge and altcoins could outperform. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-23T15:46:00,"Expert Says Bitcoin Pattern Is Clear, Predicts BTC Will Fill This CME Gap Before Rally to $175,000","A top market analyst has identified a recurring pattern of uptrend on the Bitcoin chart, sharing what’s next before a rally to a new ATH. Expert EGRAG Crypto shared Bitcoin’s clear pattern in a Monday tweet , as BTC continues to hold above $100,000. After a steep decline to $98,330, the leading cryptocurrency quickly rebounded by 2.76% to close at $101,049 on Sunday, continuing its recovery today.Bitcoin Shows Clear Growth PatternMeanwhile, EGRAG identified that Bitcoin has maintained a clear pattern of growth this cycle. Recall that BTC has been one of the standout cryptocurrencies during this bull market, outperforming most altcoins so far.The analyst shared that Bitcoin’s growth strategy includes a corrective phase where it drops below its bull market support band (BMSB), followed by a major rally to reclaim and trade above the BMSB, and then a slight correction.A first bounce follows the first retest, with another consolidation before the second bounce. After the second bounce, Bitcoin enters another corrective phase and repeats the same pattern.Interestingly, EGRAG identified two points where Bitcoin followed this pattern to the letter, as shown in an accompanying chart. Bitcoin Analysis | EGRAG Crypto For instance, Bitcoin fell into a correction in November 2022, dropping to $15,500 and slipping below the BMSB , a signal based on the 20-week SMA and 21-week EMA. It recovered in January 2023, climbing to $28,600. A bounce followed in early March after a weekly doji candle, pushing the price to $31,000. Another doji in mid-June sparked a second bounce to $31,830, before Bitcoin pulled back again into a new correction.Meanwhile, another complete pattern occurred between September 2023 and June 2024 before the current formation.What's Next for Bitcoin as Pattern FormsEGRAG’s chart shows that Bitcoin is currently developing in alignment with the pattern, breaking from a corrective phase in late April to bring prices above the BMSB and to its current all-time high of $112,000. Now, Bitcoin is in the first retest phase, which has seen it correct 8.6% from its May peak price.From here, the analyst predicts that Bitcoin would retrace further to fill a CME gap at $91,950. Following the 10% correction from the current market price, Bitcoin would rally extensively to a new all-time high between $140,000 and $160,000.Subsequently, BTC would enter the second retest phase before launching to its ultimate target of $175,000 this cycle. From the current price of $102,319, this represents a 71% uptick.Remarkably, EGRAG has persisted in his expectation that Bitcoin will target $175,000 , sharing in an earlier analysis that this would happen by September 2025. Meanwhile, targets of $200,000 and $250,000 still exist for the largest cryptocurrency by market cap.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/23/expert-says-bitcoin-pattern-is-clear-predicts-btc-will-fill-this-cme-gap-before-rally-to-175000/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=expert-says-bitcoin-pattern-is-clear-predicts-btc-will-fill-this-cme-gap-before-rally-to-175000,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Market|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare
2025-06-23T15:45:20,"Analyst Says $1.30 Could be a Trap, And Not a Bounce Zone","Analyst warns of a key XRP price zone acting as a trap due to weak structure and liquidity targets. As of today, XRP trades at $2.02, marking a 2.65% decline in the last 24 hours and an 8.35% drop over the past seven days. Yet, an analyst warns that the broader setup may point to deeper structural weakness rather than a reversal.Analyst Flags Technical Weakness on XRP ChartA market analyst, Arthur, emphasized several structural concerns surrounding XRP’s recent price behavior. Despite optimism from some traders who viewed the move above the long-term downtrend as a breakout and a journey to a new all-time high, the analyst argued that the current formation lacks a solid technical base. https://twitter.com/XrpArthur/status/1936704462669680738According to this view, the $1.30 level, which previously acted as resistance ahead of XRP’s rally to $2.90 in December 2024, remains an important area of interest.Notably, the analyst identified $1.30 as a liquidity pool where the market could sweep late long positions before any genuine upward momentum returns. The analyst pointed to the absence of confirmation in the current move, noting that market makers tend to target such zones before allowing price to climb. Meanwhile, he identified a preferred re-entry point for a potential long position between $1.05 and $1.10, an area that could offer cleaner structural support.The analyst cautioned traders to mentally prepare for a potential drop, even if it doesn’t materialize, emphasizing a strategy focused on areas of maximum pain rather than following crowd-driven moves. According to him, he prefers targeting deeper price zones where others are less likely to act.Broader Macro Conditions Weigh on SentimentBeyond technical factors, the analyst also cited macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns as contributing to a bearish outlook. He mentioned uncertainties stemming from ongoing conflicts—including tensions between Iran and Israel, and the Russia–Ukraine war—as key risks. Additionally, he highlighted delays in regulatory clarity and the unresolved status of the Ripple case as deterrents for institutional capital inflows.Furthermore, he noted that summer market conditions boast historically low liquidity, making them more susceptible to manipulation. He listed these seasonal patterns alongside frozen ETF flows and overall market hesitancy among the reasons for traders to approach current XRP levels with caution.Teucrium CEO Highlights Long-Term Use Case for XRPDespite prevailing caution, Sal Gilbertie, CEO of Teucrium, pointed to continued demand for XRP-linked investment vehicles. During a recent interview, Sal Gilbertie highlighted increasing interest in investment products tied to XRP. He observed that several market participants believe XRP holds the potential to deliver stronger long-term returns than Bitcoin.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/23/analyst-says-1-30-could-be-a-trap-and-not-a-bounce-zone/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=analyst-says-1-30-could-be-a-trap-and-not-a-bounce-zone,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction",cryptocompare

The sudden geopolitical shock triggered roughly $700 million in liquidations, primarily affecting long positions, as traders rushed to cut losses amid increased uncertainty. $700 million in liquidations shake the market Data from major exchanges shows that over 172,000 traders were liquidated following the Iran strike, with total losses estimated at $681.8 million. Bitcoin-related liquidations accounted for around $151 million, while Ethereum traders faced even larger losses, nearing $282 million. The selloff pushed Bitcoin to lows near $98,500 before it stabilized just below $100,000 and started growing again. Other crypto assets, including SOL, XRP, and DOGE also took the hit, losing over $22 million combined. Here you can check recent market developments on Coinglass' liquidation heatmap. Iran strike vs past geopolitical shocks Bitcoin’s reaction to geopolitical risk is not unprecedented. October’s Iran–Israel exchange wiped out about $495 million in crypto longs and shorts, sending the BTC price below $62K. In March 2022, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered just over $242 million in crypto liquidations, as BTC tumbled from $45,000 to $35,000 in several days. However, after the markets absorbed the news, the number one cryptocurrency rebounded 65% within two months. These patterns both highlight Bitcoin’s volatility to global uncertainty and emphasize its long-term resilience to shocks. Do geopolitical turmoils provide investment opportunities? The current geopolitical turmoil coincides with ongoing regulatory developments, including the SEC’s recent policy roadmap and increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs. These factors add complexity to the market outlook as investors balance risk with opportunities. The Iran strike has clearly demonstrated how geopolitical risk can rapidly impact crypto markets, triggering large-scale liquidations and a BTC price crash. However, historical trends and on-chain signals suggest that Bitcoin’s drops below $100,000 may offer a strategic entry point for long-term investors. Still, opportunities are short-lived.

2025-06-23T15:39:09,"Analysts Split Between $92K Dip and $135K Surge for Bitcoin","CryptoQuant warns of a $92K flush while volume metrics hint at a summer blast-off to $135K, leaving traders scratching their heads. What Do the Odds Show? After setting a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,814 a month ago on May 22, Bitcoin experienced a pullback with the top cryptocurrency presently experiencing a consolidation. At the time of this writing, BTC was trading at $103,498 per CoinGecko data . As a result, analysts are torn between painting a bullish or bearish picture as Bitcoin’s compression intensifies. Market analyst Daan Crypto Trades opined, “ BTC Still hanging around the $105K area which is the middle of the monthly range and right at the monthly open. Price has been compressing and it's clear that the market is waiting for a big move to occur.” Based on this analysis, Bitcoin’s destination might be at its monthly high of $110K or monthly low of $100K. If Bitcoin breaks down from the current range, on-chain metrics provider CryptoQuant speculates the leading cryptocurrency might nosedive to the $92K. What are the Chances of Bitcoin Making a Comeback? Crypto analyst Lingrid believes that Bitcoin might be experiencing the calm before the storm with the target being $112K. She noted, “BTC has printed three consecutive triangle continuation patterns with each breakout sending price higher into the $112K–$114K resistance zone. Now consolidating again within a descending wedge, the pair is testing the lower support band with potential for one more sweep. A rebound from this area may set up a textbook push into the same target zone. If structure holds, the breakout could be stronger than the last.” Similar sentiments were shared by Cas Abbe that on-chain metrics were showing a breakout to the upside. The market analyst stated, “ BTC price is consolidating, but On-Balance Volume (OBV) is still making higher highs. For those who don't know, rising OBV indicates buying pressure.If OBV continues to go up, BTC will eventually break out of its consolidation range. I'm still convinced that $130K-$135K BTC will happen in Q3 2025.” The OBV indicator is a technical analysis tool that measures buying and selling pressure as a cumulative indicator based on volume flow. Therefore, OBV helps confirm price trends because if the price is rising and OBV is rising, the trend is likely strong and supported by volume. This shows that a bullish picture is being painted in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Meanwhile, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continue experiencing an uptick, given that they recently witnessed strong inflows of $388.3 million despite the ongoing geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran. Will the Slashing of Interest Rates Reignite Bitcoin’s Fire? Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller recently signaled a possible interest rate cut as soon as next month, citing a cooling economy and downplaying the inflationary impact of new tariffs as minimal and short-lived. He stated , “I think we’ve got room to bring it down, and then we can kind of see what happens with inflation. We’ve been on pause for six months to wait and see, and so far the data has been fine.” Here’s why slashing interest rates is increasingly seen as a bullish signal for Bitcoin: 1. Lower Rates Diminish Bond Appeal, Drive Risk Appetite Historic Fed rate cuts reduce fixed-income yields, pushing investors toward riskier assets. As Meltem Demirors from CoinShares notes , “when real interest rates decline, [Bitcoin’s] appeal grows” The June 18 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) held rates at 4.25–4.50%, yet projections shifted toward two cuts later in 2025. That pivot has lifted sentiment in crypto markets. 2. On‑Chain Indicators Point to Bullish Setups On‑chain data from CryptoQuant suggests stabilizing open interest and accumulating ask‑liquidity near $106K—signs of a potential short squeeze. Meanwhile, technicals remain constructive: Bitcoin continues respecting support at ~$103K–105K, with upside targets between $112K–118K, should bulls defend those levels. 3. Institutional Tailwinds Compound Macro Stimulus A dovish Fed enhances the case for Bitcoin adoption among institutions. Analysts from JPMorgan, CMC Markets, and CryptoQuant argue earlier-than-expected cuts could trigger another rally toward $112K–140K As major public firms and sovereign players continue accumulating Bitcoin, easier monetary policy amplifies their conviction. 4. Historical Precedent Confirms the Pattern Historically, Fed easing has coincided with crypto bull runs. For example, in September 2024, Bitcoin jumped ~2.5% ahead of anticipated cuts. Similar behavior is emerging in 2025: cooler inflation data, supportive Fed commentary, and easing expectations have fueled BTC’s break from the $105K range. Conclusion If the Federal Reserve begins cutting rates potentially starting in July 2025, there is a high likelihood that Bitcoin will surge. With macro conditions aligning, such as inflation cooling and institutional adoption rising, cumulative tailwinds may carry BTC toward $112K–140K in the months ahead. Nevertheless, the diverging on-chain signals should not be ignored based on the $92K dip warning, as well as the $135K breakout because Bitcoin currently finds itself in a ranging market.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9669/analysts-split-between-92-k-dip-and-135-k-surge-for-bitcoin,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

He revealed that ProCap BTC will merge with Columbus Circle Capital Corp to create a Bitcoin-native financial service called ProCap Financial. He also said the company will be a publicly traded entity on Nasdaq at the conclusion of the proposed merger. The ticker for the firm on the stock exchange right now is CCCM. Pompliano raises funds through equity and convertible notes Today I am announcing a $1 BILLION merger to create ProCap Financial, a bitcoin-native financial services. The company will be a publicly traded entity on Nasdaq at the conclusion of the proposed business combination between my private company ProCap BTC, LLC and Columbus Circle… — Anthony Pompliano 🌪 (@APompliano) June 23, 2025 American investor and entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano stated that he has raised over $750 million for the initiative, the largest initial fundraising for a publicly traded Bitcoin treasury company. He revealed in the proposed deal that ProCap raised $516.5 million in equity, and ProCap Financial secured commitments for $235 million in convertible notes. According to the report, the entities intend for the convertible notes to have an associated 144A CUSIP number on the issue date. They believe the number will facilitate potential post-closing trading amongst QUBIS, but are not expected to be registered or tradeable. Columbus Circle Capital Corp noted that the convertible notes have a 130% conversion rate, a zero interest rate, and a maturity of up to 36 months. The firm said the convertible notes will be 2x collateralized by cash, cash equivalents, or a portion of the BTC purchased with the proceeds from the merger. U.S. Bank National Trust will serve as collateral agent and trustee for the convertible notes and other associated guarantee arrangements. Pompliano also highlighted that ProCap BTC agreed to purchase BTC using the funds raised in the Preferred Equity Raise within fifteen days of signing the agreements. He added that the BTC assets will be held in a custodial account until the completion of the deal, providing future shareholders of ProCap Financial with immediate exposure to Bitcoin rather than waiting until after the closing. “We are fortunate to have raised this capital from some of the leading institutional investors on Wall Street, along with many of the top crypto investors globally. ProCap Financial represents our solution to the increasing demand for bitcoin-native financial services among sophisticated investors.” – Anthony Pompliano , U.S. investor. According to the report, leading investors participating in the deal include Magnetar Capital, Woodline Partners LP, Anson Funds, RK Capital, Off the Chain Capital, Parafi, Blockchain.com, Arrington Capital, BSQ Capital Partners, and FalconX. He also acknowledged that industry veterans such as Mark Yusko, Jason Williams, Eric Semler, Tony Guoga, and Mattei Franceschetti participated as well. Pompliano said ProCap Financial will focus on acquiring BTC for its balance sheet. He also said it will develop products and services to generate revenue and profit from Bitcoin on the firm’s balance sheet. CEO of CCCM, Gary Quin, mentioned that Antony’s track record as an innovative investor, operator, and early advocate in the Bitcoin ecosystem drew him to the partnership. He said the firm believes in Pompliano’s deep expertise and hopes his relentless conviction will help continue transforming the crypto industry. Shareholders receive newly issued shares of ProCap Financial ProCap BTC revealed that former security holders of CCCM and former unitholders of ProCap BTC will receive newly-issued securities of ProCap Financial as consideration in the business deal. According to the company, the number of ProCap Financial shares issuable to the holders at closing will depend on the value of the BTC measured as of a day shortly before the closing. The number of shares will also include holders who are investors in the equity raise. The company said the holders will receive ProCap shares representing 1.25 times the number of preferred units delivered to them upon consummation of the equity raise. Before the merger, the agreement was approved by the board of directors of CCCM and by the board of managers of ProCap BTC. The terms of the deal include the proposal and its terms getting approved by the requisite CCCM shareholders and by the sole voting unit holder of ProCap BTC, an entity owned and controlled by Pompliano. Pompliano said the merger is expected to be finalized before the end of 2025, after the submission for review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of a registration of Form S-4. The registration is to register applicable securities by ProCap Financial upon finalizing the proposed business combination. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Adding to the uncertainty is the lingering silence from Judge Analisa Torres on Ripple’s latest motion in its ongoing SEC lawsuit. The case, which could clear the path for U.S. institutional sales of XRP and possibly a spot ETF approval, remains unresolved. As XRP struggles to regain footing, the broader crypto market has also dipped, with altcoins suffering extra volatility thanks to legal headlines and geopolitical tensions. But amid the chaos, there’s one development that could quietly reshape XRP’s future. I spent much of the last week in the US with the Firelight team. This product is hugely innovative and has the potential to put BILLIONS if not 10’s of BILLIONS of XRP to work -> on Flare. — Hugo Philion (@HugoPhilion) June 22, 2025 Flare Network co-founder Hugo Philion revealed on X (formerly Twitter) that Flare’s upcoming Firelight product could soon activate tens of billions of XRP. Philion hinted that after recent meetings in the U.S., this innovative solution is poised to bring billions of XRP into productive use on Flare’s ecosystem. XRP Price On Right Path? On-chain activity shows some resilience, with key wallets and escrow release schedules staying within expected ranges. Technical indicators also hint at a possible short-term bounce, with XRP’s RSI near oversold levels and key supports around $1.93 to $1.80 holding for now. Analyst Casi Trades said XRP is behaving just as expected. The price dropped close to a major support at $1.90, made a small bounce, and now looks set for a final dip to that level. This $1.90 mark is an important support zone and could signal a bottom if it holds and shows a bullish divergence. What’s even better is that Bitcoin is showing a similar pattern near $97,000. If both XRP and BTC touch these key levels together, it could trigger buying momentum and mark the start of a market rebound.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-news-can-billions-of-dormant-xrp-save-the-token-from-its-2-breakdown/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|FLR","News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

2025-06-23T15:30:24,"SRM Entertainment's Single-Month 2500% Rally: The First Public TRX Treasury Or Just Vapor?","Summary SRM Entertainment's 2500% surge is driven by pure speculation and hype, not fundamentals—there's no value or discounted cash flow case here. The $100M TRON (TRX) PIPE deal and rebranding to 'Tron' turned SRM into a speculative proxy for the TRON blockchain. Valuing SRM is impossible with traditional metrics; the core business is worthless, and the TRON deal's real value is highly uncertain. This is an ultra-speculative play best avoided unless you have deep TRON knowledge—there's no rational fair value to anchor on right now. SRM Entertainment ( SRM ) has gone from a sub-$1 micro-cap facing a Nasdaq delisting notice to one of the hottest stocks over the past month. In fact, it's up an insane 2500% during this period. Let's unpack what it's all about, but know that this isn't your typical investment case. There's nothing fundamental here. It's all speculation and hype, so if you are looking for discounted cash flows or any form of ""value"", there's nothing here for you. SRM's Stock Price (Seeking Alpha) Who Is SRM Entertainment, Anyway? SRM Entertainment, based in Winter Park, Florida, has been in operation since 1981, quietly making souvenirs such as Mickey Mouse plushies and Universal Studios t-shirts for theme park giants like Walt Disney ( DIS ), Universal, Six Flags ( FUN ), and Merlin Entertainment. Its products are sold across the U.S., China, Japan, and Europe, and recently, SRM launched on Amazon, with sales reportedly spiking 400% in three months by December 2024. But don't get too eager. The numbers are well below those of your local mom-and-pop brick-and-mortar store. In Q1, SRM posted $1.09 million in revenue, a net loss of $646,586, and a grim EBITDA of negative $3.02 million. Cash on hand? A measly $895,930, barely covering liabilities of $828,046. SRM's Quarterly Revenues (Koyfin) No wonder the stock was going down the gutter if it weren't for a single press release that set shares on fire. The TRON Bombshell: A Crypto Curveball Last Monday, SRM dropped that very bombshell press release. A $100 million private investment in publi c equity ( PIPE ) deal funded entirely in TRON ( TRX-USD ) tokens, courtesy of an unnamed institutional investor, with Dominari Securities (a boutique investment bank linked to President Trump’s family) as the placement agent. The deal’s value is pegged to TRON’s closing price on June 15, and the tokens are locked in a custodian wallet controlled by SRM’s Board, with conversion limits pending shareholder approval. SRM also announced plans to rebrand as “Tron,” brought TRON founder Justin Sun on as an advisor, and unveiled a “TRON Treasury Strategy” to hoard TRX tokens and potentially pay dividends through a TRX staking program. So, in essence, SRM is morphing into a Nasdaq-listed proxy for TRON, a layer-1 blockchain with a $26 billion market cap, known for its high-throughput network optimized for decentralized applications and stablecoin settlements. The market has gone berserk since standing at $11.04 after Friday's closing bell. I have read through tons of comments online to see investors' reaction to the news and if there is any ""insight"" from those with deeper knowledge on the TRON network, so that I can get an idea of what the optimal scenario here is. Let me tell you, nobody has any idea what this is all about, or how it's going to play out. Even Bitcoin Treasury Companies, many of which I have covered lately, are much easier to understand what they are trying to achieve. But a ""Tron Company""? So naturally, many are treating this as meme stock on steroids while others are speculating about a crypto moonshot. Honestly, someone on X mistook SRM for a rare earth mining play, for reasons unknown, which I thought was funny. Valuing SRM Stock: Chasing a Crypto Unicorn So, how do you put a price on a case like SRM right now? Obviously, forget discounted cash flow models or P/E ratios. SRM’s negative earnings and tiny revenue make those irrelevant. This is a speculative bet, and I don't believe anyone has any idea how to value it. Clearly, the core toys business is worthless. Even if you value at 1x sales, and that's generous given it's losing money, the core business is worth like max $5 million. The real action is in the TRON deal. That $100 million in TRX tokens is a game-changer, boosting SRM’s cash reserves from under $1 million to a war chest that dwarfs its current operations. Investors might be looking at this as a balance sheet story. If SRM can convert those tokens to cash (without tanking TRX’s price) or use them strategically, it could unlock notable value. But some investors are valuing SRM as if that $100 million is already cash in the bank, justifying a market cap close to or above that figure. But then, at 17.24 million shares, $100 million translates to $5.80 per share, which is below the current price of $11.04, so already this looks like a bubble ready to burst. Now, the ""premium"" might be due to SRM’s rebranding as “Tron” and its treasury strategy, making it a backdoor play on TRON’s blockchain, which is pushing for dominance in cross-border stablecoin payments. Assuming they want to start accumulating TRX the same way Strategy ( MSTR ) accumulates BTC and achieve a ""Tron Yield"" the same way Bitcoin Treasury Companies try to generate BTC yield, then you can kind of justify a market cap premium for that ""future value"". MSTR, for instance, trades at a mNAV of 1.88 , in the same fashion, while smaller treasuries like The Smarter Web Company ( OTC:TSWCF ) trade at a mNAV of over 35 (since they just started their accumulation journey and can much faster produce ""BTC yield""). Final Thoughts Again, this is all speculative. This could 10x from here as investors get caught in some sort of ""First Tron Treasury"" company vibes before crushing, or crush as soon as next week, or actually lead to sustained gains, assuming whatever all parties involved in the deal actually know what they are doing and are able to leverage TRC to generate value. It's as speculative as it gets, and there is no way on Earth you can come even remotely close to a ""fair value,"" at least for now. So if you have some deeper knowledge tied to the Tron network and feel you can understand the mechanics of this trade, you are free to take a shot. But for the rest of us, I think it's safe to say SRM is to be avoided. And this is coming from someone who's a fan of BTC treasury companies and ""gets it"". A TRX treasury? I am not so sure about that.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4796560-srm-entertainment-single-month-2500-percent-rally-first-public-trx-treasury?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|TRX","SRM",cryptocompare

Bitcoin was all there was to sell Bitcoin’s superpower of being able to be traded 24/7 and over every weekend can sometimes be prejudicial to the king of the cryptocurrencies. As the US joined the Israeli strikes on Saturday by dropping “bunker busting” bombs and launching Tomahawk cruise missiles, scared investors began to sell the only liquid and tradeable asset in their portfolios, which was Bitcoin. Then on Sunday, the Iranian parliament voted to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical chokepoint for world trade. Bitcoin dropped further on the news. However, the final decision for whether to close the Strait rests with Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, which would have to bear in mind that closure of the Strait of Hormuz would risk alienating oil-rich neighbours and could lead to an 80% spike in oil prices. Bitcoin price rally After being heavily oversold on Saturday and Sunday, the Bitcoin price has rallied on Monday morning, up 3% and $3,000 from Sunday’s low of $98,300, to currently trade at around $101,400. It now remains to be seen whether this rally can continue, or whether further events in the Middle East can stunt Monday’s price rise. $BTC moves through descending trendline Source: TradingView The short-term time frame for $BTC illustrates the beginning of a recovery. The price has moved up through the downtrend and is in the process of confirming and consolidating above. In addition, the price is taking advantage of flipping the $101,000 resistance into support. If the recovery is able to continue, this will likely depend on how the U.S. stock market performs over the rest of Monday. So far, the S&P 500 is up around 0.3%, which bodes well for the $BTC price going forward. Stochastic RSI indicators cross-up on daily time frame Source: TradingView The daily time frame for $BTC shows the strong overhead resistance levels, first at $104,000, and then at $106,000. If the U.S. stock market continues to make light of the weekend conflict developments, the $BTC price could get to the first of these big resistances at $104,000. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI has just recorded a cross up of the blue fast line over the orange slow line. These indicator cross-overs on the daily have presaged some big moves in the past as can be seen in the chart above. Major concerns on weekly time frame Source: TradingView The weekly chart view for $BTC shows that the $104,000 support did not hold the price, and that it crashed through, eventually being held up by the strong support at $101,000. In order for the bulls to regain control, they will need to retake the $104,000 level and turn it back into support again. That said, the current support at $101,000 is going to have to hold firm. The bears will be exulting that not only did they manage to break the support, but they also caused the Stochastic RSI indicator lines to dip below the 80.00 level. This is critical, because if these indicator lines do not turn back up, there could be a long descent back down to the bottom, which is likely to drag the price down with it. This new week of price action could prove to be crucial. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The project had recently registered a price jump to $0.00018203. HINU’s next price increase will see the token’s value rise to $0.00018310. The project has raised $807,387 so far. Husky Inu (HINU) Registers Price Jump Husky Inu (HINU) has just logged the latest price increase of its pre-launch phase, rising from $0.00018203 to $0.00018256. The price jump is part of the project’s pre-launch phase, which officially began on April 1, immediately after the presale ended. The pre-launch phase is designed to empower the fledgling Husky Inu community and allow the project to continue its fundraising efforts as its launch date draws closer. The pre-launch phase is the next step in the project’s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. Husky Inu’s latest price jump comes at a time when bearish sentiment dominates the market thanks to the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Rising geopolitical tensions saw the crypto market crater over the weekend as sentiment worsened. Bitcoin (BTC) plunged below the psychologically important $100,000 mark and fell to a low of $98,385. However, it recovered from this level to reclaim $100,000 and end the weekend at $100,982. The flagship cryptocurrency has rebounded during the ongoing session and is trading around $101,720. Ethereum (ETH) also registered a substantial decline over the weekend, falling to a low of $2,135 before recovering and moving to its current level of $2,278. The broader crypto market has also recovered over the past 24 hours, with Ripple (XRP) up over 4% and Solana (SOL) up over 5%, trading around $135. Dogecoin (DOGE is up nearly 6%, while Cardano (ADA) is up almost 5%. Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Toncoin (TON), Litecoin (LTC), Hedera (HBAR), and Polkadot (DOT) have also rebounded over the past 24 hours. Husky Inu Raises $807,387 Husky Inu (HINU) adopted a dynamic pricing strategy during the pre-launch phase, allowing it to raise funds more effectively. The pricing strategy allows the project to raise the price of the HINU token every two days, enabling it to raise funds while maintaining favorable pricing and empowering the project’s growing community. The project crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. Husky Inu has raised $807,387 so far and is setting its sights on the $850,000 milestone.

Bitcoin’s 10-Year Hodling Narrative Goes Through the Roof Following the 2024 halving, a pivotal shift emerged in Bitcoin’s ecosystem. For the first time ever, more BTC is becoming “ancient supply”—unmoved for over 10 years—than is being newly mined. On average, 566 BTC per day goes dormant, outpacing the 450 BTC issued daily, according to Glassnode data. Fidelity acknowledged , “The strong conviction of these ultra long-term holders is having an increasing influence on the wider Bitcoin ecosystem.” On January 1, 2019, Satoshi Nakamoto became the first Bitcoin 10-year holder, and ever since, nearly 3.4 million BTC worth more than $360 billion has joined the “ancient supply” category. Fidelity noted that roughly one-third of the ancient Bitcoin supply belongs to Satoshi, while a significant portion is likely lost or inaccessible though some of these coins could still resurface. The rise in long-term holders may partly explain Bitcoin’s sideways and downward price action in Q1 2025. Despite ancient supply outpacing new issuance, this imbalance doesn’t guarantee price gains, but it could regnite hope that the leading cryptocurrency could soar to the $205K target in the long run, owing to a remarkable hodling trend and an imminent Bitcoin supply squeeze. The supply shock narrative is supported by the fact that BTC on exchanges recently hit a 7-year low , reflecting a shift in market structure and investor behavior. Institutional Grade Bitcoin Treasury Gains Steam Not only is ancient BTC taking over, but also corporate Bitcoin adoption as a treasury asset has been going through the roof in the first half of 2025, marking a pivotal shift toward institutional-grade crypto strategies. Several factors are making institutional-grade Bitcoin treasuries more viable and appealing than ever. A growing Wave of Corporate Treasuries As of early June 2025, roughly 80 publicly listed companies collectively hold over 673,000–688,000 BTC—valued at nearly $70 billion—amounting to around 3–3.4% of all circulating Bitcoin. Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, leads with 582,000 BTC , acquired for a total of $40.79 billion at an average price of about $70,086 per Bitcoin. Other adopters include Tesla, Block, GameStop, Trump Media, Metaplanet, Semler Scientific, and Twenty One Capital. Nakamoto Holdings is the latest firm to expand its BTC treasury through a PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity) worth a whopping $51.5 million. Why is this Trend Gaining Steam Inflation hedge & dollar uncertainty Corporate leaders cite concerns over a weakening U.S. dollar, rising global debt, and unpredictable monetary policy. Bitcoin offers both a fixed-supply hedge and non-sovereign diversification. Regulatory tailwinds Under the current U.S. administration, firms like Trump Media are leveraging a more crypto‑friendly regulatory environment, with streamlined access to debt markets via convertible bonds designed to fund BTC buys . Tactical capital raising Public companies are issuing bonds, convertible notes, and equity to finance BTC accumulation—mirroring Strategy’s leveraged approach. For example, KindyMD is merging with Nakamoto Holdings with $763 million in escrow for Bitcoin reserves. Market psychology & optics Bitcoin treasury announcements often spark sharp runs in corporate stock prices—even for non-crypto firms. GameStop saw its price jump following its BTC purchase. Conclusion As more companies follow Strategy’s model—supported by IPOs, mergers, and debt financings—the Bitcoin treasury play is gaining legitimacy and momentum. This coupled with ancient Bitcoin skyrocketing, have the potential of pushing the apex cryptocurrency to unprecedented heights.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9667/long-dormant-bitcoin-wallets-tighten-supply-fueling-bullish-outlook,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
