2025-06-23T14:55:43,"Cardone and Metaplanet Add BTC to Corporate Treasuries","This is the firm’s official entry into corporate Bitcoin treasuries. Cardone described the strategy as fusing ”the two best-in-class assets” by combining income-producing real estate with Bitcoin’s long-term upside. The firm also plans to acquire an additional 3,000 BTC by year’s end. This move places Cardone Capital ahead of several major mining firms in BTC holdings and follows the launch of its dual-asset 10X Miami River Bitcoin Fund in May. Meanwhile, Japanese firm Metaplanet is closing in on Tesla’s BTC stash, with its latest 1,111 BTC purchase bringing total holdings to 11,111. Michael Saylor’s Strategy also added 245 BTC during the recent market dip, raising its total to 592,345 BTC. These latest purchases add to the corporate adoption of Bitcoin as a strategic treasury asset. Cardone Capital Adds BTC to Real Estate Mix Real estate tycoon Grant Cardone officially joined the ranks of corporate Bitcoin holders with a major treasury allocation by his firm, Cardone Capital. Over the weekend, Cardone revealed on social media that his company purchased 1,000 Bitcoin—which is valued at just over $101 million at current prices. The billionaire entrepreneur described the move as the integration of “the two best-in-class assets,” combining real estate and Bitcoin in a novel investment strategy. Cardone also disclosed plans to increase the firm’s Bitcoin holdings by an additional 3,000 BTC before the end of the year. This acquisition places Cardone Capital ahead of well-known Bitcoin mining firms Core Scientific and Cipher Mining in terms of Bitcoin treasury size, according to blockchain analytics platform BiTBO . Cardone Capital isa private equity real estate firm that was founded in 2017, and it manages over 14,000 multifamily residential units. It also has more than $5.1 billion in assets under management. Known for pooling investor capital to acquire large-scale real estate assets, the firm is now aiming to fuse traditional property investments with digital currency exposure. In May, Cardone Capital launched the 10X Miami River Bitcoin Fund , which is a dual-asset investment vehicle comprising a 346-unit multifamily property in Miami and a $15 million Bitcoin allocation. Grant Cardone explained that the idea stemmed from a conversation with his brother, who suggested creating a fund that uses real estate cash flow to buy Bitcoin—effectively compounding long-term value across both asset classes. BTC vs Real Estate Growth Projections (Source: Cardone Capital ) As more firms begin to adopt Bitcoin treasury strategies, the line between traditional asset classes and digital currencies is beginning to blur,and it is reshaping corporate finance models across many industries. Metaplanet Closes in on Tesla’s BTC Holdings Japanese investment firm Metaplanet also continued its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy, and announced the purchase of an additional 1,111 BTC on June 23. The latest buy brings the company’s total holdings to 11,111 Bitcoin. This narrows the gap with Tesla, which currently holds 11,509 BTC. According to a regulatory filing , Metaplanet spent approximately 17.26 billion yen, or $117 million, for the new purchase, paying just under $105,500 per coin. Despite Bitcoin trading around $102,000 at the time, Metaplanet's overall average cost basis is still favorable at $95,560 per Bitcoin. This new purchase happened just a week after Metaplanet added 1,112 BTC to its treasury, which pushed its holdings past 10,000 BTC for the first time. Earlier in the month, the company briefly lost its spot as the eighth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder when Hut 8 upped its stash, but Metaplanet has since reclaimed its ranking. Now trailing Tesla by fewer than 400 coins, Metaplanet could soon leapfrog the electric vehicle giant if it maintains its current pace. The next milestone after that would be CleanSpark, which currently holds 12,502 BTC. Metaplanet’s aggressive moves come amid a broader surge in corporate interest in Bitcoin treasuries. Nakamoto Holdings recently raised $51.5 million to expand its BTC reserves, while Parataxis Holdings launched a Bitcoin-native treasury platform in South Korea. Norwegian crypto firm K33 announced plans to raise $8.9 million to purchase up to 1,000 BTC, and the Norwegian Block Exchange experienced a stock surge of over 138% after revealing its own Bitcoin treasury strategy. France’s Blockchain Group also joined the growing list by acquiring 182 BTC to bring its holdings to 1,653. Bitcoin holdings (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) The corporate Bitcoin treasury trend appears to be accelerating rapidly, with more than 240 public companies now holding a combined 832,000 BTC. This accounts for almost 4% of the total 21 million Bitcoin supply. Saylor’s Strategy Buys More BTC Michael Saylor’s Strategy, the world’s largest public holder of Bitcoin, also recently added 245 BTC to its growing treasury during the broader market dip that was triggered by geopolitical tensions. The company disclosed in a Monday filing with the SEC that it spent $26 million on the purchase, paying an average of $105,856 per coin. This acquisition took place during a volatile week for Bitcoin , which fell from around $108,900 on June 16 to an intraweek low just under $99,000. BTC’s price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) While this is one of Strategy’s smaller Bitcoin purchases over the past few months—and its smallest since March’s 130 BTC buy for $10.7 million—the timing raised some questions. Some critics noticed that the company once again appeared to have bought relatively few coins during a rare price pullback. This conservative move contrasts with its more aggressive buys, like the recent $1 billion purchase earlier in June. However, the pattern aligns with Saylor’s well-known accumulation philosophy, which he’s described as “buying the top forever.” In late 2024, Saylor famously declared his intention to buy Bitcoin even at $1 million per coin, which means that he could potentially spend as much as $1 billion a day at such price levels. Despite the volatility, Strategy’s latest purchase increased its total holdings to 592,345 BTC, which was acquired at an average cost of $70,681 per coin, totaling around $41.9 billion in historical investment. With Bitcoin now trading close to $102,000, the company’s year-to-date BTC yield stands at 19.2%. This figure is a slight increase from the 19.19% yield that was reported during the $1 billion buy earlier in the month. Strategy has raised its yield target to 25% for the year, up from an earlier 15% goal set in May, reflecting growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Strategy’s Bitcoin metrics (Source: Strategy ) The new buy also happened just days after Saylor raised eyebrows with his most ambitious forecast yet. He predicted that Bitcoin could reach a price of $21 million within 21 years. The move proves that Strategy is fully committed to BTC, even during periods of short-term market uncertainty.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9665/cardone-and-metaplanet-add-btc-to-corporate-treasuries,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|ZRX","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-23T14:55:08,"BitMEX Former CEO Arthur Hayes Talks About Bitcoin (BTC)! ""The Sound of the Rise Has Been Heard, Here's Why!""","Although the US's involvement in the tensions between Israel and Iran caused a decline in Bitcoin and altcoins over the weekend, this decline was short-lived. While BTC rose above $100,000 again in the morning hours, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes, known for his bold statements, evaluated the recent decline. Accordingly, Arthur Hayes stated that the recent decline in Bitcoin and the markets was temporary and predicted that the price declines due to the tensions in the Middle East would not last long. Sharing from the X account, Hayes stated that more money will be printed and this will eventually benefit Bitcoin. At this point, Hayes argued that central banks are preparing to print more money in response to the current market weakness. According to the famous name, this will strengthen Bitcoin's position as a safe haven asset and enable BTC to prove its true value soon. “Do you hear it? … That’s the sound of money printers stepping up to do their patriotic duty. This weakness will pass and leave no doubt about BTC’s safe haven status.” Stating that he has been expecting an increase for Bitcoin and altcoins for a long time, Hayes expects BTC to rise to $150,000-200,000 by the summer of 2025 and to rise to $250,000 by the end of 2025.

2025-06-23T14:50:50,"Urgent Bitcoin Price Test: Geopolitics, Fed, and Liquidity Shape Crypto Market Future","BitcoinWorld Urgent Bitcoin Price Test: Geopolitics, Fed, and Liquidity Shape Crypto Market Future The world of cryptocurrency is buzzing with anticipation as the Bitcoin price navigates a complex landscape shaped by macroeconomic forces, geopolitical tensions, and shifting market dynamics. This week presents several crucial tests that could significantly impact the trajectory of the Bitcoin market and the broader crypto market . Understanding the Current Bitcoin Price Challenge The recent performance of the Bitcoin price has put key support levels under scrutiny. As Cointelegraph recently highlighted, a dip towards the $98,000 mark has traders and analysts closely monitoring the next potential floor. A significant concern is the decreasing market liquidity combined with increasing sell pressure. Should the $98,000 level fail to hold firmly, the next major support zone eyed by many is around $92,000. This level represents a critical point that could either stabilize the price or signal further downside potential in the immediate term. Monitoring these support levels is essential for anyone participating in the Bitcoin market . The interplay between buy and sell orders, coupled with overall market sentiment, dictates whether these levels can withstand pressure or buckle under it. Low liquidity can exacerbate price swings, making the current environment particularly volatile for the Bitcoin price . Geopolitics and the Crypto Market Global events, particularly geopolitical developments, can send ripples through financial markets, and the crypto market is no exception. The recent tensions in the Middle East involving Iran and Israel provided a stark reminder of this connection. While markets initially reacted to the escalating conflict, the response in the Bitcoin market appeared relatively contained. This suggests that while traders are aware of the potential for disruption, the current consensus among investors doesn’t seem to be pricing in a prolonged, large-scale war scenario that would significantly impact global economic stability over the long term. However, it’s crucial to remain vigilant. Unexpected escalations or new conflicts could quickly shift sentiment and introduce significant volatility. Geopolitical risk remains a factor that traders must consider when assessing the potential movements of the Bitcoin price and the broader crypto market . The U.S. Federal Reserve’s Influence on the Bitcoin Market Macroeconomic data from the United States continues to be a dominant force influencing asset prices globally, including the Bitcoin market . This week, the focus is sharply on key data releases from the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed). The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation data is particularly significant, as it is the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation. A higher-than-expected PCE reading could signal persistent inflationary pressures, potentially leading the Fed to maintain higher interest rates for longer or even consider future rate hikes. Conversely, a lower reading could increase optimism about potential rate cuts. Adding to this, Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s Congressional testimony is eagerly awaited. His comments could provide crucial insights into the Fed’s current thinking on inflation, economic growth, and the future path of monetary policy. Any hawkish or dovish signals from Powell could fuel significant macro volatility, directly impacting risk assets like Bitcoin. The market’s speculation around interest rates heavily influences investor appetite for higher-risk investments, making the Fed’s actions and communications a critical factor for the Bitcoin price . Is an Altcoin Season on the Horizon? While Bitcoin often captures the spotlight, the performance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin offers valuable clues about market cycles. Currently, Bitcoin dominance , a metric measuring Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the total crypto market cap, is nearing levels that have historically preceded a significant shift. These levels are often seen as potential reversal points, signaling a possible upcoming altcoin season . An altcoin season is a period where altcoins, collectively or individually, see significant price increases and outperform Bitcoin. The past year has largely been characterized by Bitcoin’s strength, especially leading up to and following the Bitcoin halving . However, if Bitcoin dominance starts to decline from these high levels, it could indicate that investor capital is rotating from Bitcoin into smaller cap altcoins in search of higher returns. Identifying the potential start of an altcoin season is a key strategy for many crypto traders looking to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on broader market movements beyond just the Bitcoin price . Beyond the Halving: Could Bitcoin Reach $200,000? Despite the immediate challenges and volatility, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains remarkably bullish for many analysts. Following the recent Bitcoin halving event, which reduced the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, historical precedent suggests that Bitcoin is entering a phase often associated with significant price appreciation. Analysts are projecting that BTC could potentially reach levels exceeding $200,000 in 2025. These projections are often based on the historical performance of Bitcoin following previous halvings and the cyclical nature of the Bitcoin market . The four-year cycle, largely influenced by the halving events, has historically shown a pattern of accumulation, parabolic rise, and subsequent correction. If this historical trend holds, the period following the 2024 Bitcoin halving could indeed pave the way for new all-time highs. While such price targets are speculative and subject to numerous factors, they highlight the underlying optimism and the potential for substantial growth in the Bitcoin market over the next couple of years, provided the market navigates the current macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds successfully. Summary: Navigating the Crossroads The Bitcoin price stands at a critical juncture, influenced by a confluence of factors. Immediate challenges include testing key support levels amidst liquidity concerns and the potential for volatility stemming from U.S. Fed data and geopolitical events. However, the longer-term outlook, supported by the historical impact of the Bitcoin halving and the potential for an altcoin season , remains compelling for many. Traders and investors must carefully weigh these short-term risks against the long-term potential as the Bitcoin market continues to evolve.

2025-06-23T14:46:23,"Bitcoin (BTC) Price Drops to $98,300: Weekend Selling Pressure Hits Hard","The Bitcoin (BTC) price was hit hard over the weekend as traders and investors were obliged to sell the only asset they could during a weekend of US bombing of Iranian nuclear installations and a threat from Iran to close the commercially critical strait of Hormuz. Bitcoin was all there was to sell Bitcoin’s superpower of being able to be traded 24/7 and over every weekend can sometimes be prejudicial to the king of the cryptocurrencies. As the US joined the Israeli strikes on Saturday by dropping “bunker busting” bombs and launching Tomahawk cruise missiles, scared investors began to sell the only liquid and tradeable asset in their portfolios, which was Bitcoin. Then on Sunday, the Iranian parliament voted to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical chokepoint for world trade. Bitcoin dropped further on the news. However, the final decision for whether to close the Strait rests with Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, which would have to bear in mind that closure of the Strait of Hormuz would risk alienating oil-rich neighbours and could lead to an 80% spike in oil prices. Bitcoin price rally After being heavily oversold on Saturday and Sunday, the Bitcoin price has rallied on Monday morning, up 3% and $3,000 from Sunday’s low of $98,300, to currently trade at around $101,400. It now remains to be seen whether this rally can continue, or whether further events in the Middle East can stunt Monday’s price rise. $BTC moves through descending trendline Source: TradingView The short-term time frame for $BTC illustrates the beginning of a recovery. The price has moved up through the downtrend and is in the process of confirming and consolidating above. In addition, the price is taking advantage of flipping the $101,000 resistance into support. If the recovery is able to continue, this will likely depend on how the U.S. stock market performs over the rest of Monday. So far, the S&P 500 is up around 0.3%, which bodes well for the $BTC price going forward. Stochastic RSI indicators cross-up on daily time frame Source: TradingView The daily time frame for $BTC shows the strong overhead resistance levels, first at $104,000, and then at $106,000. If the U.S. stock market continues to make light of the weekend conflict developments, the $BTC price could get to the first of these big resistances at $104,000. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI has just recorded a cross up of the blue fast line over the orange slow line. These indicator cross-overs on the daily have presaged some big moves in the past as can be seen in the chart above. Major concerns on weekly time frame Source: TradingView The weekly chart view for $BTC shows that the $104,000 support did not hold the price, and that it crashed through, eventually being held up by the strong support at $101,000. In order for the bulls to regain control, they will need to retake the $104,000 level and turn it back into support again. That said, the current support at $101,000 is going to have to hold firm. The bears will be exulting that not only did they manage to break the support, but they also caused the Stochastic RSI indicator lines to dip below the 80.00 level. This is critical, because if these indicator lines do not turn back up, there could be a long descent back down to the bottom, which is likely to drag the price down with it. This new week could prove to be crucial. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-23T14:39:38,"Bitcoin Move to $96K or $106K Next? (BTC Price Analysis)","Bitcoin just broke below a multi-week consolidation range as things get even more heated in the Middle East. While the long-term trend remains bullish, short- to mid-term momentum is weakening as the market shows signs of lower highs and lower lows forming. By Shayan Bitcoin Price Analysis: Technicals The Daily Chart The daily timeframe paints a more concerning picture for buyers. BTC was stuck in a tightening range for several weeks, forming a descending triangle. This structure broke to the downside briefly with a wick, as the price aggressively tested the demand zone between $98K and $100K. This are had previously acted as a launchpad for the May rally. The reaction here has been sharp: BTC printed a long lower wick, indicating the presence of aggressive buyers. While follow-through remains limited, the daily candle closed back inside the pattern, suggesting that this behavior might just be a sell-side liquidity sweep. Moreover, the RSI on the daily has now dropped to the 40 level, hovering just above the oversold threshold. This isn’t yet bullish divergence, but it does show that momentum is no longer in the buyers’ favor. If the $98K–$100K zone fails to hold on a closing basis, BTC could quickly drop toward the next major support around 96K, which also aligns with the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, and the lower boundary of the large ascending channel. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart Zooming into the 4H timeframe, we can clearly see the breakdown structure and how BTC has been respecting bearish order flows. After the sell-side liquidity grab just below $100K, the price bounced sharply and filled the FVG that formed between 100K and $102K. This fair value gap is now acting as resistance, capping any bullish attempts to push higher. There are two FVGs now in play: the recent one just above 100K and the older one near $106K, which previously pushed the price lower. Unless BTC reclaims the recent high near the $103K mark with conviction, it’s more likely to revisit lower support levels than to retest the $106K area. Notably, the 4H RSI has bounced from oversold conditions (near 30) to the 40–45 range, indicating a short-term relief, but this is still far from a trend reversal. Market structure remains bearish with lower highs and lower lows being printed consistently since mid-June. In short, the 4H bias remains bearish below $103K, and price is currently trading inside a reaction zone. Bitcoin needs to break and close above this FVG for any potential reversal to gain momentum. Source: TradingView On-Chain Analysis Bitcoin Miners Position Index The onchain landscape provides a bit of relief for long-term holders. The latest reading of the Miners’ Position Index (MPI) shows that miner selling pressure is minimal. Historically, elevated MPI values (above 2) have preceded strong market corrections, as miners tend to offload large amounts of BTC into rallies. However, current MPI values remain well below 1, signaling that miners are holding their coins rather than selling them aggressively. This suggests that the recent drop is more likely driven by market structure, liquidity grabs, and short-term derivatives pressure, rather than long-term fundamental shifts. Combined with stable exchange reserves and growing accumulation wallets, the data leans neutral to slightly bullish from an onchain perspective.

2025-06-23T14:38:46,"Canaan to Exit AI Chip Business, Double Down on Bitcoin Mining Amid Realignment","Canaan Inc. (CAN), the Singapore-based manufacturer of bitcoin mining machines, will wind down its artificial intelligence (AI) semiconductor business to refocus on its core crypto operations. Despite the growing trend of bitcoin miners diversifying their revenue through AI-related businesses, building AI chips is likely very competitive and not cost-effective for smaller companies. Canaan said that its AI unit, which brought in just about $900,000 in revenue in 2024 (versus total revenue of $88.8 million) and accounted for 15% of company-wide operating expenses, failed to align with the firm's long-term strategy, the company said on Monday. “Doubling down on our core strengths in crypto infrastructure and bitcoin mining is the most strategic path forward,” CEO Nangeng Zhang said in the statement. Before the move, the company said it began exploring options for the AI unit as far back as March 2022, including selling it or shutting it down entirely. Now, Canaan expects to complete the phase-out in the coming months and anticipates a sharp drop in costs once the exit is finalized. Canaan is best known for its Avalon mining rigs, one of the earliest brands of ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) miners built for bitcoin. The firm went public on Nasdaq in 2019 and continues to develop mining hardware while also expanding into self-mining and consumer mining products. The decision, which comes after years of trying to diversify into edge computing chips, is hardly a surprise given the recent focus of miners and mining chip makers on "" American Made "" bitcoin after Trump's U.S. election win. Recently, Benchmark's Mark Palmer wrote in his research that rig maker's shares don't reflect upside potential from the expansion of the company's self-mining operations, especially in the United States. Canaan's shares were slightly down on Monday, while the broader digital assets and equities markets were mostly positive. The stock fell 71% this year, while a bitcoin mining ETF, WGMI, declined about 20%.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/06/23/canaan-to-exit-ai-chip-business-double-down-on-bitcoin-mining-amid-realignment,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|RESEARCH","Finance|Bitcoin Mining|Canaan|AI|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-23T14:38:05,"Wall Street is being flooded by a new generation of investors","Wall Street is being flooded by a new generation of investors who don’t trust the traditional system and are making it clear they’re not sticking with stocks and bonds. Millennials and Gen Z, mostly under 43 and holding real money, are steering their wealth into crypto, real estate, pre-IPO startups, collectibles, and other alternative assets. They’ve seen crashes, bailouts, and inflation destroy portfolios, and they’ve had enough. Their money is going where the old playbook doesn’t reach. According to Bloomberg, Bank of America has seen the number of its retail clients holding alternatives more than double since 2020. The bank adds around 50 new alternative funds every year. A large study by BofA last year showed that 73% of wealthy investors under 43 don’t believe a traditional stock-and-bond mix will make them rich. About 93% said they plan to pour more cash into alternatives going forward. Investment firms create retail versions of elite products The change is forcing big names to rebuild how they package investment products. Firms like Blackstone and Apollo are rolling out ETFs and semi-liquid funds that look retail-friendly but were once only for institutions. These funds are now available through private banks and fintech apps. Forge Global Holdings dropped the minimum investment threshold to $5,000, which led to a spike in daily signups. Many of the new users were chasing early access to companies like OpenAI, trying to grab a piece before any IPO. These new investors see the 60/40 portfolio as broken. That model, which used to split 60% into stocks and 40% into bonds, completely failed in 2022 when inflation pushed both assets down at the same time. Morgan Stanley recently filed to launch a fund that gives access to everything from private debt to real estate and infrastructure. A survey by CAIS revealed that 80% of alternative managers are planning to launch retail products, nearly double the figure from three years ago. The demand is growing, and Wall Street is adjusting fast. High-risk products gain traction despite warnings These new investments aren’t simple. Many are expensive, complex, and illiquid — and yet, people are still buying in. Blackstone’s real estate investment trust had to limit withdrawals in 2022 after interest rates spiked. Despite that, investors kept coming. Strategists at JPMorgan have told clients to lower exposure to private credit and equity because they’re lagging behind public markets again this year. One academic paper called alternatives “costly and wasteful,” and Moody’s warned that bringing retail investors into private markets adds serious liquidity risk to the system. Still, none of that has slowed demand. On TikTok and Reddit, the get-rich-quick mindset is spreading fast. The move isn’t just limited to Gen Z or millennials though. Chad Blackburn, a 45-year-old accountant in Nashville, started buying equities as a teen but now puts most of his cash into Bitcoin and startups. “The dotcom bubble and the great financial crisis forced me to think more deeply about my investments,” Chad said. “Why would I limit myself to just stocks and bonds, especially when a lot of this stuff is not nearly as diversified as you think?” Real estate, crypto, and private equity are the top picks for these investors. There’s a psychological angle too. Many believe traditional markets are rigged or too fragile. Owen Lamont, a portfolio manager at Acadian Asset Management, said, “They think the system is rigged against me. I have to do something out of the box in order to get rich.” The push from retail investors is also tied to exhaustion from institutional clients. Pensions, endowments, and insurers already allocate about 20% of their portfolios to alternatives. But individuals? Just 7%. That gap is huge, and Wall Street is chasing it. Chris Toomey, managing director at Morgan Stanley Private Wealth Management, explained the difference. Older investors prefer infrastructure and steady returns. The younger crowd leans into private equity. “They are at a point in their investment cycle where they have the ability to take on that risk,” Chris said. “They’re early investors and they’ve got a much longer time horizon.” But it’s not every young person. Vanguard says thousands of Gen Z and millennial savers are sitting on piles of cash in default IRAs instead of putting money into diversified portfolios. For every alt-hunter, there’s someone just hoarding dollars in money markets.

2025-06-23T14:30:42,"Bitcoin Price Eyes Critical $97K Support as Sentora Data Reveals Investor Wall","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Eyes Critical $97K Support as Sentora Data Reveals Investor Wall The cryptocurrency world is buzzing as Bitcoin price continues its fascinating dance around the significant $100,000 psychological barrier. While headlines often focus on round numbers, savvy investors and analysts look deeper, utilizing tools like on-chain data to understand the underlying market structure. This is where insights from platforms like Sentora come into play, offering a granular view of where investors are positioned and what that might mean for potential support and resistance levels. What Does Sentora Data Tell Us About BTC Support? Sentora, the on-chain data analytics platform formerly known as IntoTheBlock, recently shared a key observation regarding the current Bitcoin price action. According to their analysis, BTC is actively retesting the $100,000 level. More importantly, their data points to the $97,000 level as a crucial area of support. Why is this specific price point so important? Sentora’s data reveals a significant concentration of buying activity around the $97,000 mark. Specifically: Approximately 1.6 million unique addresses acquired Bitcoin at an average cost basis of $97,000. These addresses collectively hold a substantial amount of BTC, totaling around 1.14 million coins. This concentration of ownership at a particular price level often acts as a strong support zone. When the price approaches this level, investors who bought there are less likely to sell at a loss, and new buyers may see it as an attractive entry point, creating buying pressure that can help the price bounce. This phenomenon is often referred to as an ‘investor wall’ or a ‘support cluster’ based on cost basis. Understanding On-Chain Data and Its Value for the Crypto Market For those new to the concept, on-chain data refers to information directly recorded on the public blockchain ledger. Unlike traditional market analysis that relies on price charts and trading volumes from exchanges, on-chain analysis delves into the actual transactions, addresses, and movements of cryptocurrencies. This provides unique insights into: Investor Behavior: Tracking wallet activity, accumulation, distribution, and holding periods. Market Structure: Identifying concentrations of ownership, cost bases of different investor cohorts, and supply dynamics. Network Health: Analyzing transaction counts, fees, and mining activity. The Sentora data highlighting the $97,000 support is a prime example of how this type of analysis can provide a different perspective than standard technical indicators. It’s not just about lines on a chart; it’s about understanding where actual investors have placed their capital. Why is the $97K Level Critical for Bitcoin Price? As Bitcoin price tests the waters around $100,000, the $97,000 level identified by Sentora becomes a critical pivot point. Here’s why: Validation of Investor Conviction: If the price dips to $97,000 and bounces strongly, it validates the conviction of the 1.6 million addresses who bought there. It suggests they are holding firm and potentially adding more, reinforcing the support. Potential Springboard for Further Upside: A successful defense of this key support level could provide the necessary base for Bitcoin to gather momentum and potentially break convincingly above the $100,000 resistance. Warning Signal if Broken: Conversely, if the BTC support at $97,000 fails and the price drops significantly below it, it could indicate that even these committed investors are starting to feel pressure, potentially leading to cascading sell-offs as those who bought at $97,000 look to exit to avoid further losses. This could open the door to testing lower support levels. Therefore, monitoring the price action around $97,000 in the coming days and weeks, informed by Sentora data , will be crucial for anticipating Bitcoin’s next major move. Challenges and Considerations in Relying on Sentora Data Alone While on-chain data like that provided by Sentora offers invaluable insights, it’s important to remember it’s just one piece of the puzzle when analyzing the crypto market . Other factors significantly influence price action: Macroeconomic Factors: Interest rates, inflation data, global economic stability, and central bank policies all impact investor sentiment and capital flows into risk assets like Bitcoin. Regulatory News: Government regulations or lack thereof in major economies can create significant volatility. Market Sentiment and News Events: Major hacks, exchange issues, or positive developments (like ETF approvals) can trigger rapid price movements independent of underlying on-chain structure. Technical Analysis: Traditional chart patterns, indicators, and trading volumes from exchanges still play a vital role in understanding short-term price movements and trader psychology. Using Sentora data in conjunction with these other analytical methods provides a more holistic view of the market. The $97,000 level is a strong on-chain indicator, but its strength will be tested by the broader market environment. Actionable Insights from the $97K Sentora Data Based on the insights from Sentora regarding the BTC support at $97,000, here are some actionable takeaways: Monitor the Level: Keep a close eye on how Bitcoin price behaves if it approaches $97,000. Look for signs of buying pressure or a bounce. Assess Volume: If the price hits $97,000, observe the trading volume. A strong bounce on high volume could indicate robust support, while a weak bounce on low volume might suggest less conviction. Consider Your Strategy: If you are looking to buy Bitcoin, this level might be on your radar as a potential entry point, assuming it holds. If you are holding Bitcoin, understand that a break below this level could signal further downside risk. Combine Analysis: Don’t rely solely on Sentora data . Use it to complement your technical analysis and stay informed about broader market news. Understanding where significant clusters of investors have established their cost basis provides a powerful lens through which to view potential support zones in the crypto market . In Summary: The Significance of Sentora’s $97K Finding Sentora’s analysis highlighting the $97,000 level as a key support zone, backed by the presence of 1.6 million addresses holding 1.14 million BTC at that average price, offers valuable insight into the current market dynamics. As Bitcoin price navigates the territory around $100,000, this on-chain derived support level represents a significant potential floor established by a large cohort of investors. Whether this investor wall holds will likely play a crucial role in determining Bitcoin’s immediate trajectory. Monitoring this level, informed by on-chain data like that from Sentora, is essential for anyone tracking the crypto market .

In June 2022, the FTC filed a complaint alleging that from 2013 to 2018, Walmart turned a blind eye to scammers who exploited its in-store money transfer services to defraud US consumers out of hundreds of millions of dollars. The retailer serves as an agent of the money transfer service providers MoneyGram, Western Union and Ria. The complaint says that Walmart failed to implement effective anti-fraud policies and procedures, was remiss in providing proper training to its employees and did not adequately warn its customers about potential fraud related to money transfers. A year later, the regulator amended its complaint to add further details related to Walmart’s alleged telemarketing violations. A stipulated order filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division on Friday, aims to resolve the FTC’s claims concerning Walmart’s money-transfer services The settlement, which is still subject to the District Court judge’s approval, prohibits the retailer from providing “fraud-induced” money transfer services or assisting sellers or telemarketers who solicit goods, services or charitable contributions through telemarketing. The company is also barred from assisting those who ask consumers to pay for loans and credit extensions in advance.

2025-06-23T14:25:46,"Ripple Price Analysis: XRP Taps $2 But How Low Can it Go?","XRP has entered a critical phase in its market structure, with bearish pressure intensifying across both its USD and BTC pairs. After weeks of consolidation just above key support zones, the asset has now broken down, triggering concern among traders and investors alike. This shift in momentum reflects not only technical weakness but also XRP’s continued underperformance relative to both Bitcoin and other major altcoins. XRP Price Analysis: Technical By Shayan The USDT Pair On the daily chart, XRPUSDT remains compressed within a long-term descending channel pattern, bounded by a descending trendline from the yearly highs and a horizontal support near $1.60. Tons of sell-side liquidity resting below the $2 level have been swept today, as the pair is currently trading below both the 100 and 200 moving averages, which are located in the $2.20-$.240 range. The RSI is also hovering near 34, indicating the lack of momentum and confirming the range-bound behaviour. If sellers manage to breach $1.95, the next logical demand zone lies around $1.6. Meanwhile, upside resistance remains at the upper bound of the channel near $2.40 and the moving averages mentioned earlier. A clean break and daily close above these resistance elements would potentially confirm a bullish rally, with the target being around $3. Until then, this is still a neutral to slightly bearish structure favouring range traders rather than trend-followers. Source: TradingView The BTC Pair Against Bitcoin, XRP has shown persistent weakness since March, consistently printing lower highs and lower lows. The chart highlights a clear bearish market structure. Both the 100 and 200 moving averages, located near the 2,400 SAT mark, are angled downward after a bearish crossover, and the RSI is still depressed near 32, reflecting ongoing relative underperformance. Meanwhile, the pair is approaching the imbalance zone (FVG) left from the explosive rally in late 2024. This pocket, located just below 1900 SAT, could act as a support zone for a potential relief bounce. If the buyers step in here, the first challenge lies near the 2200 SAT resistance level. A decisive move above that area could shift short-term momentum, but unless that happens, the pair remains locked in a clear bearish structure.

2025-06-23T14:15:37,"Bitcoin and Digital Asset Clarity Is Essential for Our Financial Future","In recent weeks, Congress has made historic strides toward securing America’s leadership in digital asset innovation. With the passage of the GENIUS Act , we’ve taken a major step toward ensuring that this emerging sector operates under clear, consistent rules—rules that protect consumers, encourage responsible innovation and strengthen national security. But make no mistake: this is just the beginning. As leaders who bring complementary perspectives—one from years shaping financial policy in the U.S. Senate, the other from decades in national security—we share a conviction: the United States must lead on Bitcoin and digital asset innovation. Clear, responsible rules will unlock economic opportunity, preserve privacy and protect against illicit finance. Washington’s approach must be rooted in both freedom and security—and we’re committed to advancing that balance. The GENIUS Act represents a major step forward in establishing guardrails for stablecoins—digital tokens backed 1:1 by dollars or dollar equivalents. It creates a clear pathway for both state and federal oversight, ensures stablecoin issuers meet transparency and reserve requirements and protects consumers without stifling innovation. With stablecoins playing an increasingly important role in global finance, this bipartisan bill gives the U.S. a competitive and credible framework to lead. Broader market structure reform is also essential. Congress must provide long-overdue clarity to the industry by distinguishing between digital assets that are securities and those that are commodities. Bills like the Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act grant primary jurisdiction to the CFTC for digital asset commodities, give the SEC new consumer protection authority and lay the groundwork for responsible innovation across the digital asset ecosystem. For innovators, it’s a green light; for bad actors, a stop sign. It also sends a powerful message: the U.S. is ready to compete. Countries around the world are racing to attract crypto companies, talent and capital. We cannot afford to drive the next wave of financial infrastructure overseas because of outdated laws or regulatory hostility. While the digital asset ecosystem is broad and diverse, Bitcoin remains its foundation—our best chance to lead the world in building a decentralized monetary system rooted in liberty and individual sovereignty. This Congress, the BITCOIN Act was introduced in both the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives with the goal of clarifying Bitcoin’s status under federal law, advancing efforts to responsibly integrate it into our financial system and promoting its use as a secure and censorship-resistant reserve asset. But legislation like this doesn’t matter in theory—it matters in practice. And Michiganders are already paying attention. Just this year, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in Lansing introduced a series of pro-crypto bills to protect consumers, promote transparency and create a “Cryptocurrency Bill of Rights.” The state also launched the Michigan Cryptocurrency and Financial Innovation Caucus to educate policymakers and support forward-thinking digital asset strategies. This includes a proposed state-run cryptocurrency reserve—a visionary approach that could help secure Michigan’s financial future. Wyoming has shown what’s possible when smart regulation meets innovation. The state has passed more than 30 digital asset laws in recent years, establishing a comprehensive framework for blockchain banks, digital property rights and tokenized finance. Michigan is now stepping up as a national leader in its own right—and we couldn’t be more encouraged. Still, major issues remain unsolved in Washington. We must pass a de minimis exemption to allow Americans to use Bitcoin for small everyday purchases without triggering burdensome tax reporting. We must end the double taxation of bitcoin—from mining to sale—and fix the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) to ensure that bitcoin is not penalized under the new regime. These aren’t niche issues—they’re foundational to ensuring Bitcoin can thrive as a tool for freedom and inclusion. What’s at stake is more than just a new asset class. It’s the future of financial sovereignty, national competitiveness and innovation itself. America must lead the world in building a digital economy that reflects our values: transparency, individual liberty and open access. The GENIUS Act is a major victory—but it’s not the final one. In the months ahead, we’ll continue working to enact smart, comprehensive rules to govern how digital assets are issued, traded, and regulated, address critical tax and regulatory issues and ensure that the United States remains the safest and most trusted home for Bitcoin and digital assets anywhere in the world. We’re just getting started—and we’re proud to have Michigan in the fight.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/06/23/bitcoin-and-digital-asset-clarity-is-essential-for-our-financial-future,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","Opinion|Opinion",cryptocompare
2025-06-23T14:15:17,"Sequans seeks to revive business with $384 million Bitcoin treasury plan","Sequans Communications S.A., a France-based semiconductor firm specializing in 4G and 5G Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, announced Monday it intends to raise approximately $384 million through private placements in equity and convertible debt, to fund a Bitcoin treasury. According to a press statement from the company, the funding round comes alongside a partnership with Swan Bitcoin, a US-based Bitcoin investment and treasury management platform. Equity and debt placement terms finalized Sequans has reportedly entered into definitive agreements to issue around $195 million in equity and $189 million in secured convertible debentures. The combined gross proceeds will total approximately $384 million. The funding will be raised through two separate private placements, one for equity and one for debt . The equity component includes the sale of approximately 1.39 billion ordinary shares, equivalent to 139.3 million American Depositary Shares (ADSs), along with common warrants exercisable within 90 days. The securities are priced at a combined $1.40 per ADS and warrant, or $0.14 per ordinary share and warrant. In total, this tranche is expected to raise $195 million. “ The debt portion includes secured convertible debentures amounting to $189 million and additional common warrants for roughly 202.5 million ordinary shares, also exercisable within 90 days of closing ,” the statement read. Companies seek crypto holdings expansion According to Sequans CEO Georges Karam, the Bitcoin treasury strategy is a long-term bet on the potential of the digital asset’s growth. “ Our bitcoin treasury strategy shows our strong conviction in bitcoin as a premier asset and a compelling long-term investment ,” Karam surmised. “ We believe bitcoin’s unique characteristics will enhance our financial resilience and deliver significant value to our shareholders .” Still, the company reiterated that it is dedicated to its telecommunications mission. “ We continue to support our customers with a robust 4G and 5G product roadmap, ” Karam added. Northland Capital Markets and B. Riley Securities will be the joint lead placement agents, while Yorkville Securities could be added as an additional placement agent. Legal counsel for Sequans includes Lowenstein Sandler LLP in the US and ARCHERS (AARPI) in France. Goodwin Procter LLP is advising the placement agents in both jurisdictions. Meanwhile, ECD Automotive Design Inc., a US restorer of luxury Land Rover and Jaguar vehicles, announced it has signed a $500 million equity facility with ECDA Bitcoin Treasury LLC. Much like Sequans, the company said the funding will support its plans to implement a Bitcoin treasury strategy. “ We are excited to secure this significant financing option, which strengthens our financial foundation and enables us to diversify our treasury strategy with Bitcoin ,” Ben Piggott, CFO of ECD Automotive Design, said in a press conference earlier today. NYSE compliance bump amid crypto collaboration The announcement comes shortly after Sequans received a compliance warning from the New York Stock Exchange. On June 5, 2025, the NYSE issued a notice indicating that the company no longer met listing requirements under Section 802.01B of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. The deficiency lies in Sequans’ global market capitalization falling below $50 million over a 30-day trading period, combined with shareholder equity also below that threshold. The notice requires the company to submit a plan within 90 days detailing how it intends to regain compliance within a nine-month period. The NYSE will review the proposed plan and determine within 45 days if Sequans has a credible way to reinstate its compliance. The company’s ADSs will continue trading during the review and cure period, provided other listing standards are met.

2025-06-23T14:12:09,"QCP Capital Shares Its Expectations for Bitcoin (BTC) in the Shadow of US-Iran Tension! ""We Are in a Critical Week!""","The US got involved in the tension between Israel and Iran and hit Iran. This situation negatively affected Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins, with the BTC price falling below the psychological level of $100,000. While the downward anxiety continues in the markets and investors, Singapore-based analysis company QCP Capital evaluated the latest situation. At this point, QCP analysts first noted that the recent sell-off in BTC constituted its lowest print since breaking the psychological $100,000 level on May 8. The sell-off in Bitcoin and major altcoins was triggered by Iran’s threat to close the Strait of Hormuz, a move seen as damaging to global oil flows. However, Bitcoin returned above $100,000 this morning, suggesting that the pullback over the weekend was mainly due to macro factors. At this point, despite Iran's threats of retaliation against the US, the market believes that the possibility of a major conflict is limited and the US is pressuring Iran through diplomatic channels to surrender and stop. According to analysts, this played a role in stabilizing the market. QCP also said that traditional markets also reacted calmly to the developments between the US and Iran over the weekend, as US stock futures, oil and gold prices returned to Friday levels after initial fluctuations. This suggests that investors see this as a regional risk rather than a global crisis. Analysts say the Bitcoin market is at a critical turning point balancing risk appetite and safe-haven demand amid geopolitical uncertainty. “….Still, BTC is consolidating near the $100,000 level even after a surge in leveraged long positions. This makes the next few days particularly important. The market remains at a crossroads where digital assets are straddling a critical line between risk-on momentum and risk-off defensiveness amid ongoing geopolitical uncertainty.” The analytics firm also listed the key events to watch this week as follows: “Tuesday (Jun 24): Fed Chair Powell's Speech Wednesday (Jun 25): Fed Chair Powell's Speech Thursday (Jun 26): US GDP and Unemployment Data Friday (Jun 27): US Core PCE” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-23T14:10:31,"Revealed: Top 10 Crypto Keywords Powering the Korean Community Last Week","BitcoinWorld Revealed: Top 10 Crypto Keywords Powering the Korean Community Last Week Curious about what’s buzzing in one of the world’s most active crypto markets? The South Korean crypto community, often dubbed the K-Community, is a significant force in shaping global sentiment and trading volumes. Understanding which digital assets are capturing their attention provides invaluable insight into emerging trends and market focus. Last week, from June 13 to 19, the Bitcoin World K-Community platform offered a fascinating glimpse into the tokens that were most searched for and discussed. Understanding the Korean Crypto Community ‘s Focus The data collected from the Bitcoin World K-Community platform highlights the distinct interests within this vibrant market. We can break down their focus into two key areas: what they are actively searching for and what they are mentioning in discussions. These two metrics don’t always align perfectly, offering a nuanced view of engagement. What Were the Top Crypto Searches Korea ? When the K-Community members went looking for information, certain tokens stood out significantly. The volume of searches often indicates potential interest, research activity, or perhaps reaction to recent price movements or news. Here are the top 10 most searched tokens: XRP : 60,593 searches – Leading by a massive margin, indicating strong, sustained interest. ETH : 17,970 searches – Ethereum remains a core interest, likely due to its foundational role and ongoing developments. BTC : 17,252 searches – Bitcoin, the market leader, consistently ranks high. ONDO : 14,156 searches – A notable presence, suggesting growing interest in this specific altcoin. SOL : 11,383 searches – Solana continues to attract significant search volume. UXLINK : 10,318 searches – Another altcoin making a strong appearance in searches. RVN : 6,508 searches – Ravencoin shows persistent search interest. ZKJ : 5,716 searches – An intriguing entry, indicating specific community focus. ORBS : 5,377 searches – Orbs maintains a presence in search queries. TRUMP : 5,367 searches – Reflecting the growing trend of political meme coins, particularly relevant given global political events. The dominance of XRP in search volume is particularly striking. While Bitcoin and Ethereum are perennial favorites, the high search numbers for specific altcoins like ONDO, UXLINK, and ZKJ suggest active exploration of newer or less mainstream projects within the South Korean crypto landscape. Which Tokens Saw the Most Top Crypto Mentions Korea ? Mentions often reflect active discussion, trading activity, or reactions to events. While search is about seeking information, mentions are about sharing thoughts and engaging with others. The list of most mentioned tokens shows some overlap with searches but also key differences: BTC : 1,476 mentions – Bitcoin leads discussions, cementing its status as a primary topic. ETH : 829 mentions – Ethereum is also heavily discussed, mirroring its search volume. TRUMP : 370 mentions – The TRUMP token sees significant discussion volume, higher relative to its search rank. XRP : 294 mentions – Despite leading searches, XRP is fourth in mentions, suggesting more people are researching it than actively discussing it compared to BTC/ETH. SOL : 174 mentions – Solana remains a popular topic of conversation. ONDO : 75 mentions – ONDO is discussed, but its mention volume is considerably lower than its search volume. ORBS : 70 mentions – Similar to ONDO, ORBS sees fewer mentions relative to searches. DOGE : 51 mentions – Dogecoin appears in the mention list, indicating its continued presence in community chat. SUI : 38 mentions – SUI enters the top mentions, showing specific project interest. RVN : 36 mentions – Ravencoin rounds out the list of most mentioned tokens. Comparing the lists, Bitcoin and Ethereum are consistently high in both searches and mentions. XRP dominates searches but takes a lower spot in mentions. Conversely, TRUMP has a higher relative ranking in mentions compared to searches. This difference could indicate that while many are curious about XRP, the core trading and discussion activity revolves more around BTC, ETH, and tokens like TRUMP that might be experiencing recent volatility or news. What Do These Crypto Market Korea Trends Tell Us? The data provides valuable insights: Established Giants Remain Core: Bitcoin and Ethereum are fundamental to the K-Community’s interest, consistently appearing at the top of both lists. XRP’s Enduring Appeal: The massive search volume for XRP suggests ongoing speculation or hope regarding its future, perhaps tied to its legal status or potential developments. Altcoin Exploration is Active: Tokens like ONDO, UXLINK, RVN, ZKJ, ORBS, and SUI show that the community is actively researching and discussing a wide range of alternative cryptocurrencies beyond the top few. Emerging Narratives Gain Traction: The high ranking of the TRUMP token in mentions highlights the influence of new, potentially volatile narratives like political meme coins within the community discussion. Search vs. Mention Dynamics: A high search volume coupled with a lower mention volume (like XRP, ONDO, ORBS) might indicate tokens that people are researching individually rather than discussing collectively, perhaps due to uncertainty or a focus on personal analysis. Conversely, tokens with relatively higher mention volume than search volume (like TRUMP, DOGE, SUI compared to some lower-ranked search tokens) could suggest topics driven more by communal hype or reaction to events. For anyone tracking the South Korean crypto market, these trends underscore the diverse interests and active engagement of the K-Community. It’s a market that pays attention to the majors but is also quick to explore new opportunities and react to unfolding narratives. Summary: Decoding K-Community Sentiment Last week’s data from the Bitcoin World K-Community provides a clear snapshot: the Korean crypto community remains deeply engaged with the market. While Bitcoin and Ethereum form the bedrock of their interest and discussion, altcoins like XRP, ONDO, SOL, and UXLINK are subject to significant research. Furthermore, emerging trends, exemplified by the TRUMP token’s prominence in discussions, show the dynamic and sometimes speculative nature of the crypto market Korea . Tracking these top searches and mentions offers a powerful way to gauge community sentiment and identify tokens gaining traction.

2025-06-23T14:01:16,"Texas Makes History: First State to Hold Bitcoin in Treasury","Texas is the US history's first state to officially set aside public funds for acquiring and holding Bitcoin after Governor Greg Abbott signed Senate Bill 21 (SB21). The historic bill establishes the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a publicly held fund that will hold Bitcoin as a long-term investment of Texas's financial holdings and as a future inflation hedge. How the Texas Bitcoin Reserve Works The Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is designed to be independent of the state treasury as a whole, giving it free rein to manage digital currencies. The reserve will be operated by the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, advised by a crypto advisory committee made up of three investment experts. The only market-capitalization assets worth more than $500 billion,—are simply Bitcoin at present—are worthy of holding, to maintain the fund's focus on the most secure digital asset. The reserve can grow not only directly by purchasing through surplus funds but also through forks, airdrops, investment income, and even public donations of cryptocurrency. In order to ensure transparency and accountability, a biennial public report on the reserve holdings and performance will be submitted. Another companion bill, House Bill 4488, also protects the reserve from sweeping into the state's general revenue fund, preventing it from being subject to shifting budget priorities and budget crises. Why Texas—and Who's Next? Not only is Texas the initial state to pass a Bitcoin reserve law, but it is also the initial state to direct funds from real public coffers and create a separate, actively managed structure for holding Bitcoins. Arizona and New Hampshire passed similar bills, but their reserves are backed only by non-tax revenues like forfeited cryptocurrency assets or donations. Texas's bold action is already becoming contagious: Kentucky, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and several others introduced Bitcoin reserve bills, and experts say there could be a ”global race” to stock up on BTC as state governments and even universities start diversifying with digital assets. How Will the Reserve Be Managed? Texas Comptroller has broad authority to purchase, retain, and, if necessary, liquidate Bitcoin reserves. Security is paramount: the law demands intensive cold storage procedures and allows the state to engage skilled custodians and liquidity providers with a minimum of five years' experience trading digital assets. Investment approach, risk protection, and staying informed of evolving regulations will be aided by the advisory committee. Transparency is inherent: the biennial public report will disclose the amount and value of Bitcoin being held, investment performance, and any updates on the status of the reserve. Such disclosure is intended to guard against volatility and risk concerns, as well as make Texas a leader in responsible crypto finance. Potential Effect on Spot ETF Inflows and the Market Texas's move is not symbolic. By adopting Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, the state is issuing a powerful message to institutional investors, pension funds, and other government agencies. According to analysts, if even a few states follow Texas's example, demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs and direct ownership of BTC might soar, accelerating supply constrictions and in turn potentially driving prices higher. Already, US spot Bitcoin ETFs hold over 5.9% of the total BTC supply, and state-level adoption would further cement Bitcoin as ”digital gold” for public and private investment portfolios. What's Next for State Crypto Adoption? As Texas's reserve goes live later this fall, all eyes are on the experiment unfolding. Will the reserve outperform traditional assets and initiate a domino effect of copycat measures? Or will volatility and political opposition to temper the trend? In the meantime, Texas has made its bet as the first state to buy Bitcoin with public funds—a development that may reshape the future of American government finance. Bottom Line Texas's action to add Bitcoin to its treasury is a watershed in crypto mainstream adoption in public finance. As other states consider following its lead, the Lone Star State's pilot program may set the standard for digital asset stewardship—and propel the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin across the country at an accelerating pace.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9662/texas-makes-history-first-state-to-hold-bitcoin-in-treasury,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-23T14:00:49,"Korean Crypto Investors Defy Fear: 34.3% See Bull Market Intact Amidst Geopolitical Storm","BitcoinWorld Korean Crypto Investors Defy Fear: 34.3% See Bull Market Intact Amidst Geopolitical Storm Are Korean crypto investors brushing off global turmoil? A recent survey suggests that despite rising geopolitical tensions , a significant portion of investors in South Korea remain surprisingly optimistic about the future of the crypto market. This insight offers a fascinating look into how different investor bases perceive risk and opportunity in volatile times. What is the Latest Crypto Market Sentiment in South Korea? Conducted by Bitcoin World and Cratos between June 17 and 20, the survey tracked weekly trends among South Korean cryptocurrency investors. The findings reveal a complex picture of expectations and sentiment: Overall Optimism: 38.7% expressed optimism or extreme optimism about the market. Neutral Stance: 35.4% held a neutral view. Fear and Pessimism: 25.9% indicated feelings of fear or extreme fear. This breakdown shows a leaning towards positive or neutral sentiment, even as external pressures mount. It highlights a resilience or perhaps a long-term perspective among a substantial segment of South Korean investors. What is the Bitcoin Price Outlook According to the Survey? The survey specifically queried investors on their expectations for Bitcoin (BTC) value in the upcoming week. The results show a notable shift towards bullishness compared to the previous week: Bitcoin Price Expectation This Week (June 17-20) Last Week Increase or Significantly Jump 41.9% 37.0% Stable Market 33.4% 36.0% Decline or Sharp Drop 24.7% 27.0% The increase in those expecting a rise and the decrease in those expecting stability or decline suggest growing short-term confidence in Bitcoin’s performance among these investors, despite the prevailing macro environment. Is the Crypto Bull Market Still Alive? One of the most compelling questions in the survey addressed the status of the current market cycle, particularly against the backdrop of escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. While global events often trigger sell-offs and uncertainty, Korean crypto investors presented varied, yet often hopeful, perspectives: Bull Market Intact: 34.3% believe the bull market is still ongoing. This is a significant portion who see recent dips as temporary corrections rather than the end of the upward trend. Rebound Expected Post-Tensions: 29.2% anticipate a broad market recovery once geopolitical tensions subside. This group acknowledges the current impact but sees it as a temporary setback. Bull Run Ended / Bear Market Begun: 23.2% hold the view that the bull run has concluded and a bear market has commenced. This represents the more cautious or pessimistic segment. Bitcoin-Only Gains: 13.3% believe only Bitcoin will see gains even after the conflict eases, suggesting a flight to the perceived safety or dominance of BTC over altcoins in uncertain times. Combined, nearly two-thirds (34.3% + 29.2% = 63.5%) of respondents hold a view that is either currently bullish or expects a return to bullish conditions once external factors improve. This highlights a strong underlying belief in the market’s potential among South Korean investors. Understanding the Geopolitical Impact Crypto The survey acknowledges the frustration felt by investors when negative geopolitical headlines disrupt market recoveries. Cryptocurrency markets, known for their volatility, can be particularly sensitive to global instability. Conflicts, political uncertainty, and economic sanctions can lead to: Increased Risk Aversion: Investors tend to move away from riskier assets like crypto towards perceived safe havens (though the ‘safe haven’ status of Bitcoin itself is debated and sometimes observed during specific crises). Supply Chain and Economic Shocks: Broader economic impacts of conflicts can affect investor liquidity and confidence. Regulatory Uncertainty: Geopolitical events can sometimes trigger discussions or actions around regulating cryptocurrencies at a national or international level. The fact that 34.3% of Korean crypto investors still see the crypto bull market as intact despite these clear external pressures is a notable data point, suggesting that internal market dynamics or a long-term conviction in the technology might be outweighing short-term fear for many. Key Takeaways and What It Means This survey provides valuable insight into the mindset of a significant group of investors in a key market like South Korea. While the overall sentiment is mixed, the proportion of investors maintaining a bullish stance or expecting a post-tension rebound is substantial. It suggests that while geopolitical impact crypto is real and acknowledged, it hasn’t universally crushed the long-term optimism fueled by previous market cycles and ongoing adoption trends. For market observers, this highlights the importance of looking beyond just price charts and considering the diverse psychological factors and regional sentiments that influence investor behavior. The survey underscores that conviction in the underlying technology or the potential for future gains remains strong for many, even when global headlines are grim. Conclusion: Hope Persists Amidst the Storm In conclusion, the survey of Korean crypto investors paints a picture of cautious optimism and persistent hope. Despite the acknowledged drag from geopolitical tensions , a significant minority believes the crypto bull market continues, and an even larger group expects a strong recovery. The Bitcoin price outlook also saw an uptick in positive expectations. While fear is present, it does not dominate the sentiment for the majority. This resilience in investor conviction from South Korea serves as a compelling data point for understanding the current state of the global crypto landscape.

2025-06-23T13:55:01,"Dow Jones flat amid muted reaction to U.S. strikes on Iran nuclear sites","Stocks opened slightly higher Monday morning, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average largely flat as oil prices remained muted amid ongoing concerns of a potential escalation in the Middle East conflict. While cryptocurrencies bore the brunt of the sell-off in risk assets over the weekend, stocks looked likely to shrug off the initial impact of the United States’ strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites. This saw the blue-chip U.S. index Dow Jones Industrial Average open 15 points up, while the benchmark index S&P 500 was up 0.14%. The Nasdaq Composite edged 0.18% higher as investors weighed sentiment that the U.S. wasn’t looking to further escalate tensions with Iran. You might also like: Dow Jones up 100 points as Federal Reserve balances Iran tensions U.S. enters Iran-Israel conflict Stocks had edged higher last week after President Donald Trump said he had given Tehran two weeks to negotiate a nuclear deal. But the U.S. went on to strike Iran’s nuclear sites, timing the attacks for the weekend while equities remained closed. As the U.S. launched attacks on Iran’s nuclear sites in Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz on Saturday, the move took investors by surprise. “We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan. All planes are now outside of Iran air space. A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow,” Trump posted on Truth Social. Crypto tanked as Bitcoin ( BTC ) fell to lows of $98,300. Meanwhile, oil prices briefly spiked amid nerves that a blockade on the Strait of Hormuz was imminent. But with no blockade as of Monday’s market open, investor concern of a swift retaliation has not played out. The overall market outlook is one of investor caution, with the latest reports suggesting Iran’s retaliatory attacks against U.S. forces could come as soon as a “day or two.” Meanwhile, BTC has recovered to above $101,000, while oil prices have pulled back to around $74 a barrel.

In the view of its executives, BTC offers long-term monetary integrity unmatched by fiat currencies or traditional assets. With inflation expectations lingering and global monetary policy in flux, Bitcoin’s programmatic scarcity and 24/7 liquidity have made it, in Strategy’s calculus, a superior reserve asset. The company’s 19.2% BTC yield in 2025 so far has only reinforced this conviction. This blueprint is now being replicated worldwide. In Japan, Metaplanet has accumulated 11,111 BTC since adopting its Bitcoin-first treasury policy in 2024, including a recent 1,111 BTC haul that brought its holdings within striking distance of Tesla’s. Executives there have framed the accumulation as part of a deliberate pivot to a Bitcoin-first treasury model aimed at “maximizing shareholder value in the long term” while reducing exposure to Japan’s weakening yen. Metaplanet explicitly cites Strategy’s success as inspiration. Elsewhere, South Korea’s Parataxis recently secured $18 million to launch a Bitcoin treasury vehicle on the KOSDAQ exchange, while U.S.-based KindlyMD is pursuing a multimillion-dollar merger with Bitcoin investment firm Nakamoto Holdings to pivot to a BTC treasury operation. These moves suggest a growing institutional consensus that corporate treasuries need crypto exposure, particularly as global debt markets show increasing volatility.

2025-06-23T13:45:36,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Tanks Geopolitical Tensions Drive Price Below $100,000","Bitcoin (BTC) slipped below the crucial $100,000 mark on Sunday for the first time since the beginning of May after the US struck key nuclear sites in Iran, significantly escalating the conflict and plunging markets into disarray. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency fell to a low of $98,385 on Sunday before recovering to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $100,982. The airstrikes and escalation cratered the market, triggering widespread panic and leading to over $1 billion in liquidations. BTC is struggling during the ongoing session, with the price marginally up, trading around $101,252. Arthur Hayes Remains Confident About Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin’s (BTC) latest pullback does not have industry veteran Arthur Hayes worried. Hayes believes the decline will not impact market sentiment in the long term and is confident about the flagship cryptocurrency’s long-term strength. Hayes believes BTC’s recent price action and decline are temporary, and the broader economic backdrop could soon turn bullish for the asset. Hayes hinted that rising global pressure could lead to more liquidity injected into the financial system, benefiting BTC , and restoring it as a reliable store of value. “Do you hear that? It’s the sound of the money printers revving up to do their patriotic duty. This weakness shall pass, and BTC will leave no doubt as to its safe haven status.” The BitMex co-founder's comments came after Bitcoin briefly slipped below $100,000 over the weekend, falling to a low of $98,385 on Sunday as geopolitical tensions escalated. However, it rebounded to reclaim $100,000 and end the weekend at $100,982. BTC’s recent slide has seen it drop to its lowest levels since May and is part of a broader downturn in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin still shows signs of weakness, as pointed out by Rekt Capital on X, “Two weeks ago, Bitcoin's downside wicked almost -4% below $104400 before ultimately Weekly Closing above said level This week, Bitcoin is downside wicking -5% below $104400. Of course, Bitcoin could very well confirm a breakdown. But until the Weekly Close is in, it's not a confirmed breakdown just yet, and if the breakdown does become confirmed, then we won't be able to rule out a possible downside deviation until $104400 flips into resistance.” Spot Bitcoin ETF Demand Loses Steam Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US experienced a sharp drop in inflows as investor sentiment turned bearish amid escalating geopolitical concerns thanks to US airstrikes on Iran. According to data from SoSoValue, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $1.02 billion in inflows over the past week, a substantial decline from $1.39 billion the week prior. The previous week started well, with Bitcoin ETFs registering $412.2 million in inflows on Monday and $216.48 million on Tuesday. Wednesday saw $389.57 million in inflows, while Thursday was a holiday due to Juneteenth. However, inflows fell off a cliff on Friday with just $6.37 million, down 98% from the average of the previous three days. Friday’s activity was confined to BlackRock’s IBIT, which saw $46,91 million in inflows. However, this was offset by a $440.5 million outflow from Fidelity’s FBTC. Markets have been jittery since the US launched coordinated airstrikes on Iran, marking a turning point in the Israel-Iran conflict. Iran warned of consequences and shut down the Strait of Hormuz, a key passage used for transporting nearly 20% of the world’s oil supply. Analysts point out that oil prices could spike if the conflict continues. Crypto Market Register $1B In Liquidations Crypto market liquidations topped $1.3 billion on Sunday as investors reeled from the news that the US had conducted airstrikes at key installations in Iran. With traditional markets shut over the weekend, the crypto market was the first to bear the brunt of the escalating geopolitical situation. As a result, BTC dipped below $100,000 on Sunday, while other cryptocurrencies registered notable declines. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) fell below $100,000 for the first time since the beginning of May as market sentiment plunged after the US conducted air strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites. The airstrikes marked a significant escalation in the Middle East, triggering panic across the crypto market. As a result, liquidations topped $1 billion, impacting over 240,000 traders. However, despite Sunday’s stunning collapse, markets have recovered. While BTC fell to a low of $98,385 on Sunday, it recovered to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $100,982. Analysts believe markets are pricing in the conflict and do not expect a prolonged escalation in hostilities. Iran’s foreign minister also met with Russian officials in Moscow as diplomatic backchannels reopened following the airstrikes. BTC’s climb back above $100,000 comes alongside modest movement in gold prices, and a subdued reaction across oil and equity futures. According to analysts, traders are expecting a limited and contained conflict. The Kobeissi Letter posted on X that markets are expecting a short-lived war, stating, “Over the last 72 hours, the US bombed Iranian nuclear sites, Russia said countries are ready to supply Iran with nukes, and Iran's parliament voted to close the Strait of Hormuz. Yet, stock market futures are down a mere -0.5% at the open, and oil prices are up less than +2.5%. This is NOT a market that is pricing in a long-term conflict. If the market was pricing in JUST a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, oil prices would be at $120+. Objectively, the market is still expecting a short-lived war.” Pav Hundal, lead analyst at Swyftx, believes that if tensions in the Middle East decrease, investor confidence could rebound, allowing prices to recover. “We saw a lot of Twitch trading in the hours after the US attacked Iranian nuclear targets, and right now trade volumes remain elevated. If we start to see a softening in tensions in the Middle East, we should start to see a rebound in investor confidence, and the price should start to grind back up.” However, he cautioned that nobody knows what will happen next in the Middle East, creating further market industry. “Nobody, including Trump, knows what is going to happen next in the Middle East, and that just creates the kind of uncertainty that traders hate.” BTC registered a sharp drop on Thursday (June 12), falling nearly 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,826. Selling pressure intensified on Friday as BTC fell to a low of $102,854. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase, reclaim $106,000, and settle at $106,106. Price action was mixed over the weekend as BTC registered a drop of 0.59% on Saturday before registering a marginal increase on Sunday to settle at $105,561. BTC raced to an intraday high of $108,939 on Monday. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $106,808, ultimately registering an increase of 1.18%. Sentiment changed on Tuesday as BTC fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $105,000 to settle at $104,519. Source: TradingView BTC registered a marginal increase on Wednesday, rising 0.35% to $104,884. However, it was back in the red on Thursday, dropping 0.24% to $104,631. BTC reached an intraday high of $106,513 on Friday but lost momentum after reaching this level. As a result, it fell 1.19%, slipping below the 50-day SMA and settling at $103,888. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price fell 1.17% to $102,180. BTC plunged below $100,000 on Sunday, falling to an intraday low of $98,385 as market sentiment worsened. However, it recovered to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $100,982. The current session sees BTC marginally up as buyers struggle to build momentum and push the price higher.

2025-06-23T13:45:27,"Signs of an Explosive Move Above $110K for the BTC Price? This Analyst Clarifies","Pseudonymous CryptoQuant analyst Avocado_onchain sees Bitcoin’s latest consolidation, after plunging to $98,467 before a shaky recovery, not as stagnation but as coiled energy. Data provided by the market watcher shows that long-term holders (LTHs) are steadfastly accumulating rather than distributing, a historical hallmark that often precedes explosive rallies by the king cryptocurrency. Market Tension Meets On-Chain Calm Over the past week, BTC weathered increased volatility caused by escalating tensions in the Middle East as the U.S. bombed several suspected Iranian nuclear facilities. As CryptoPotato reported, on June 22, the asset plunged below $100,000, with the shockwave of the U.S. attack wiping out as much as $700 million in leveraged positions. At the same time, altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) suffered losses of their own, dipping 6% and 7% respectively. Despite the turmoil, Bitcoin’s dominance grew, reflecting a flight to relative safety amid a broader market steeped in red. Against this background, the latest CQ report paints a picture of deliberate accumulation by LTHs. The 30-day moving average of the Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) indicator, a metric tracking when long-held coins move, peaked around 0.6, dropping well below the 0.8 threshold. This implies that seasoned investors are not rushing to sell, signaling that the bull cycle remains structurally intact. “This moderation below 0.8 still implies the market may be entering a consolidation period, and further price or time correction could follow,” noted Avocado_onchain. “Historically, Bitcoin’s explosive rallies tend to occur when market attention fades and sentiment is quiet, making the current silence potentially a precursor to the next big move.” Meanwhile, data from Glassnode shows that short-term holders (STHs), who have been in the market for under 155 days, are sitting on slim 3% unrealized gains, suggesting limited profit-taking pressure from recent buyers. Price Holds Key Support Amid Demand Slowdown Elsewhere, ETF inflows and accumulation by deep-pocketed investors have notably slowed , with daily ETF purchases dropping from a peak of 9,700 BTC on April 23 to roughly 3,300 BTC as of June 22. Similarly, whale balance expansion has halved from 3.9% month-on-month in late May to 1.7%. Price action reflects this tense situation. While BTC is showing some resilience above $100,000, its recent performance over the past week, where it dropped 4.9%, and the month, where it shaved 5.6% off its price, are signs of the current struggle. The weekly range oscillating between $98,975 and $108,771 also highlights the rejection near the psychological and technical barrier at $110,000. Additionally, daily volatility has been elevated, as seen by the 24-hour swing between $98,467 and $102,782 per CoinGecko data. However, Bitcoin is still outperforming the broader crypto market, down 6.70% over the past week. This relative strength, coupled with LTH inactivity, could be a sign of underlying support building even as short-term demand falters.

2025-06-23T13:40:37,"Green Minerals Makes Bold $1.2B Move to Boost Bitcoin Treasury","BitcoinWorld Green Minerals Makes Bold $1.2B Move to Boost Bitcoin Treasury In a move that underscores the growing intersection between traditional industries and the world of cryptocurrencies, Norwegian deep-sea mining company Green Minerals has announced a significant strategic shift. The company plans to raise a substantial amount of capital, specifically earmarked for expanding its Bitcoin treasury . This decision highlights a growing trend among corporations exploring digital assets as a core component of their financial strategy. Green Minerals: Diving Deep into Mining and Bitcoin Green Minerals , primarily focused on the exploration and potential extraction of minerals from the seabed, operates within the specialized and capital-intensive field of deep-sea mining . Their core business involves navigating complex geological environments and regulatory landscapes to potentially source valuable resources. However, their recent announcement signals an expansion of their strategic focus beyond just physical assets. According to a statement on their official website, the company intends to raise up to $1.2 billion with partners. The primary objective of this massive capital raise isn’t solely for mining operations but explicitly includes growing their Bitcoin treasury . This makes the acquisition and holding of digital assets a fundamental part of their overall financing and asset management approach. This move is particularly noteworthy because it comes from a company in a traditional, resource-based industry, rather than a tech or finance firm. It suggests a broader acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, into diverse corporate structures globally. Why Build a Corporate Bitcoin Treasury? The concept of a corporate Bitcoin treasury has gained traction over the past few years, notably popularized by companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla. But why would a company, especially one like Green Minerals involved in deep-sea mining , choose to allocate significant capital to volatile assets like Bitcoin? There are several potential reasons driving this trend: Inflation Hedge: Many companies view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, given its decentralized nature and capped supply. Potential for Appreciation: Bitcoin’s historical price performance offers the potential for significant returns on investment, which could enhance shareholder value. Diversification: Holding Bitcoin can diversify a company’s balance sheet away from traditional fiat currencies and assets. Attracting Investment: Embracing digital assets can appeal to a new class of investors, particularly those interested in the crypto space. Strategic Innovation: It positions the company as forward-thinking and adaptable in a rapidly changing financial landscape. For Green Minerals , integrating Bitcoin into their strategy could be seen as a way to future-proof their finances, leverage potential crypto market growth, and perhaps even mitigate some of the specific risks associated with long-term, capital-intensive projects like deep-sea mining . Comparing Traditional vs. Bitcoin Treasury Assets Traditionally, corporate treasuries hold assets like cash, short-term government bonds, and other low-risk, liquid investments. Here’s a simple comparison: Feature Traditional Treasury Assets (Cash, Bonds) Bitcoin Treasury Primary Goal Capital preservation, Liquidity Potential growth, Inflation hedge, Diversification Volatility Low High Liquidity Generally High High (depending on market conditions) Potential Return Low High (but also high risk of loss) Regulatory Environment Well-established Evolving and uncertain Storage/Security Banks, Financial Institutions Requires specialized digital asset security (wallets, custody solutions) This table highlights the fundamental difference in risk profile. A corporate Bitcoin strategy is inherently more speculative than holding traditional assets, aiming for growth rather than just preservation. What are the Challenges and Risks for a Bitcoin Treasury? While the potential rewards of holding digital assets like Bitcoin are significant, so are the risks. Green Minerals and its partners will need to navigate several challenges: Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings, potentially leading to significant paper losses on the company’s balance sheet. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still developing globally, which could impact how companies can hold, manage, or use their Bitcoin holdings. Security Risks: Storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss due to hacking or mismanagement of private keys. Accounting and Tax Treatment: The accounting and tax rules for corporate crypto holdings are complex and vary by jurisdiction. Public Perception: While increasingly accepted, Bitcoin can still be viewed with skepticism by some investors or the public, potentially affecting the company’s image. Execution Risk: Successfully acquiring and managing such a large amount of Bitcoin requires specialized expertise. For a company in deep-sea mining , which already faces its own set of technical, environmental, and regulatory hurdles, adding the complexities of managing a large Bitcoin treasury adds another layer of challenge. Actionable Insights for Investors and the Market The announcement by Green Minerals provides several key takeaways: Expanding Corporate Adoption: This reinforces the narrative that corporate interest in Bitcoin and other digital assets is not limited to tech companies but is spreading across diverse sectors, including traditional industries like deep-sea mining . Strategic Intent: When a company explicitly raises capital for crypto acquisition, it signals a strong, deliberate strategic intent rather than just allocating spare cash. Due Diligence is Key: Investors interested in Green Minerals or similar companies adopting crypto strategies should perform thorough due diligence. Understand the company’s rationale, risk management approach, and the potential impact of crypto volatility on their financials. Market Signal: Large capital raises targeting Bitcoin can provide positive sentiment for the broader crypto market, indicating continued institutional demand. This move by Green Minerals could potentially pave the way for other companies in resource or industrial sectors to consider similar strategies involving a corporate Bitcoin treasury. Conclusion: A Bold Step into Digital Assets Green Minerals’ plan to raise $1.2 billion specifically to bolster its Bitcoin treasury is a bold and significant development. It represents a clear commitment to integrating digital assets into the core of their financial strategy, moving beyond the traditional confines of the deep-sea mining industry. While the strategy comes with inherent risks associated with Bitcoin’s volatility and the evolving regulatory landscape, it also positions Green Minerals to potentially benefit from the growth of the digital asset class and diversify its balance sheet. This decision serves as a compelling example of how companies across different sectors are increasingly viewing Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a potential long-term store of value and a strategic treasury asset in the digital age.

The token’s 24-hour trading volumes have surged by 41%, possibly as this bearish breakout blew up a significant number of long positions. XRP has been consolidating for a while after the token surged near its all-time highs in January. A handful of legal victories against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and a change in leadership within the regulatory agency for a pro-crypto figure – Paul Atkins – favor a bullish XRP price prediction. Meanwhile, the launch of Ripple USD (RLUSD) and the rapid expansion of its market cap paired with the latest announcement concerning USDC support within the Ripple blockchain has also strengthened XRP’s prospects. That said, the market has underplayed and ignored most of these bullish catalysts for the most part of 2025. XRP Price Prediction: Retest of $1.9 Support Seems Highly Likely Crypto liquidations in the past 24 hours have surged to more than $620 million as per data from CoinGlass . This has been the result of the latest developments in the Middle East. XRP dropped to $1.91 and bounced off that level and it now seems headed to retest a former support at $2.08 from below to confirm a bearish outlook. If the price rejects a move above that area, it could result in a significant downturn in the short-term as it means that XRP has broken its consolidation to the downside. Meanwhile, the long-term price trend has shifted to bearish as the token is now trading below its 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). Trading volumes at $1.91 were quite high and above the average. This confirms the relevance of this price zone and the existence of significant buying interest at that level. Hence, this, along with the $2.08 resistance, are the key areas to watch in the next few hours. Any development in the Middle East that could point to an escalation in the conflict – e.g. the involvement of more countries – could further plunge XRP as the price of the U.S. dollar will likely rise. In the meantime, Bitcoin (BTC) has been resilient to this downturn as investors see it as a safe haven during times of geopolitical distress. This hot crypto presale called BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) stands to gain if the top crypto climbs to a new all-time high in the midst of the turmoil. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) Rewards Will Be Unlocked Once BTC Reaches Certain Price Milestones BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) introduces an innovative rewards system tied to the performance of Bitcoin (BTC). Starting at a baseline price of $100,000, a new reward will be unlocked every time BTC adds an extra $25,000 to its price. The first milestone, set at $125,000, will trigger an automatic token burn of BTCBULL that should raise the price of this meme coin immediately. Meanwhile, once BTC reaches $150,000, token holders will receive a direct airdrop. These actions are performed automatically by smart contracts that have been audited by two crypto firms – Coinsult and Solid Proof. To buy $BTCBULL and benefit from BTC’s next leg up, head to the BTC Bull Token website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to invest.

2025-06-23T13:35:10,"If SHIB Beats Tether, Here’s How Much 1 Shiba Inu Could Be Worth","Surpassing Tether's current market cap could push Shiba Inu to a new all-time high, potentially dropping one of its leading zeros. Despite crashing to a 16-month low of $0.00001010 over the weekend, Shiba Inu still maintained its position as the 19th-biggest crypto by market cap. However, it risks being overtaken by Litecoin and dropping to the 20th position.Nonetheless, many investors remain optimistic, encouraged by bullish statements from the Shiba Inu team, which promised better days for SHIB.Through its marketing lead, Lucie, the team emphasized that it is not yet over until Shiba Inu wins. Last year, Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, hinted at plans to position SHIB among the top 5 cryptocurrencies. Market Cap Required for SHIB to Overtake Tether Several months after Kusama’s bold claim, we examine how much one SHIB would be worth if Shiba Inu overtook Tether’s (USDT) market cap. Tether has ranked among the top five crypto assets for years. At the time Kusama made his comments, USDT was the third-largest cryptocurrency. As of press time, it still holds that position, boasting a market cap of $156.02 billion. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu is currently the 19th-largest crypto with a valuation of $6.37 billion.Assuming Shiba Inu’s market cap increases to $156.1 billion while Tether’s valuation remains stable at $156.02 billion, SHIB would surpass USDT to become the third-largest cryptocurrency globally. Shiba Inu would be trailing only Bitcoin and Ethereum in this hypothetical scenario.Shiba Inu Price If It Surpasses Tether Such a development would significantly impact SHIB’s price, potentially pushing it to levels never seen before. For reference, when SHIB hit its all-time high of $0.00008845 in October 2021, its market cap was under $45 billion.If Shiba Inu’s market cap reaches $156.1 billion with a circulating supply of 589.25 trillion tokens, each SHIB would be worth approximately $0.0002649. This represents a 2,350% increase from its current price of $0.00001081. Is $0.0002649 Feasible for Shiba Inu? Reaching this new price milestone would mark an all-time high for SHIB and remove one zero from its price. Since its launch, SHIB has never traded with just three leading zeros.Nonetheless, some experts believe SHIB could eventually reach $0.0002649. While crypto exchange Changelly predicts this could happen by May 2032, Telegaon estimates it could materialize as early as 2028. Meanwhile, The Crypto Basic has reported several projections from top experts who believe the $0.0002 price milestone is within reach. In September 2024, Analyst Michael referenced a bullish Elliott Wave formation on Shiba Inu’s chart to predict a surge to the $0.0002 mark in the medium term. In addition, Charting Guy disclosed that he was doubling his Shiba Inu holdings in anticipation of a major spike to the $0.0002 range. He made this prediction in November 2024, when SHIB was trading around $0.000025. Since then, SHIB has dropped 60% and is now trading at $0.00001081.Despite this decline, the prospect of a price surge to $0.0002649 remains. The token has previously experienced massive rallies, the largest of which occurred during the 2020–2021 bull run.However, whether SHIB can ultimately reach a $156.1 billion market cap or surpass Tether’s valuation remains speculative.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/23/if-shib-beats-tether-heres-how-much-1-shiba-inu-could-be-worth/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=if-shib-beats-tether-heres-how-much-1-shiba-inu-could-be-worth,"BTC|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|USDT","Market|Latest Shiba Inu (SHIB) News Today|Shiba Inu Price Prediction",cryptocompare
2025-06-23T13:33:36,"Blockstream’s Adam Back Says Altcoin Season ‘Is Over’ — Time to Rotate Into Bitcoin Treasuries","Blockstream CEO Adam Back believes altcoin season is over, urging investors to rotate into Bitcoin and BTC treasury stocks instead. Key Takeaways: Blockstream CEO Adam Back says altcoin season is over and urges a shift toward Bitcoin and BTC treasuries. Over 240 public companies now hold Bitcoin, signaling growing institutional interest and adoption. Some BTC treasury firms are trading at steep premiums, raising concerns about investor overexposure. “TSRY SZN is the new ALT SZN for speculators,” he wrote on X on Monday, adding, “Time to dump ALTs into BTC or BTC treasuries.” Back’s remarks come as public companies ramp up Bitcoin accumulation through innovative financial strategies such as convertible notes and equity offerings. These firms, he noted, are buying BTC “on repeat to increase Bitcoin per share,” making them increasingly attractive for investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin without holding the asset directly. 240 Firms Now Hold Bitcoin as a Treasury Asset According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET, the number of public companies holding Bitcoin has doubled since June 5, rising from 124 to over 240. Collectively, they now hold approximately 3.96% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Back, who has long championed institutional adoption as a path to “hyperbitcoinization,” reiterated his view that Bitcoin-focused companies offer a potential lifeline to traders stuck in underperforming altcoins. “Maybe they can make back their losses by switching to BTC by way of treasury companies,” he said. yes but i was encouraging them to find a way out of alts. maybe they can make back their losses by switching to btc by way of treasury companies. — Adam Back (@adam3us) June 22, 2025 Still, some treasury firms are drawing scrutiny for the high premiums investors are paying. Metaplanet, a Japanese investment firm, traded at a premium of over $596,000 per BTC-equivalent on May 27, sparking concerns about overvaluation. Momentum behind corporate Bitcoin adoption continues to grow. On June 12, Nasdaq-listed Mercurity Fintech Holding announced an $800 million raise to establish a long-term Bitcoin reserve. Days earlier, France-based Blockchain Group revealed plans to raise $340 million for a similar move. While altcoins lack the same traction, institutional interest hasn’t vanished entirely. Interactive Strength, a Nasdaq-listed fitness tech firm, recently announced plans to raise $500 million to create a Fetch.ai token treasury, suggesting that selective altcoin bets still hold appeal. Utility over speculation. Interactive Strength is allocating up to $500M to purchase $FET as a core component of their AI-powered fitness roadmap. This is what real-world AI adoption looks like. https://t.co/XyaZhUTVxm — Fetch.ai (@Fetch_ai) June 12, 2025 Texas Establishes Public Bitcoin Reserve Notably, Bitcoin adoption has gained momentum at both the national and state levels. Last week, Texas became the first U.S. state to create a publicly funded Bitcoin reserve, following the passage of Senate Bill 21 signed by Governor Greg Abbott. The reserve, overseen by Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar, is designed as a standalone fund separate from the state treasury. Unlike similar initiatives in Arizona and New Hampshire, Texas is creating a standalone reserve fund entirely separate from the state treasury. On the Federal front, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve . While Texas moves ahead, other states are retreating from similar efforts. Florida, Arizona, and several others have recently scrapped or vetoed crypto legislation over concerns about volatility and digital assets’ long-term viability.
