2025-06-23T09:50:13,"Shocking Crypto Market Dip: Geopolitical Events Trigger $1B Liquidations & Bitcoin Price Fall","BitcoinWorld Shocking Crypto Market Dip: Geopolitical Events Trigger $1B Liquidations & Bitcoin Price Fall The cryptocurrency market experienced a sudden and significant downturn, sending ripples of concern through the investment community. This latest crypto market dip appears closely linked to escalating global tensions, specifically following reports of U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. The swift reaction across digital asset prices highlighted the market’s sensitivity to external geopolitical factors, leading to substantial losses for many holders. Geopolitical Events Trigger Market Turmoil While often touted as a decentralized and uncorrelated asset class, cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, have shown increasing sensitivity to macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. The recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites served as a stark reminder of this connection. Such events typically trigger a ‘risk-off’ sentiment across global financial markets, where investors tend to move away from perceived higher-risk assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies towards safer havens like gold or government bonds. The news broke, and the immediate reaction in the crypto space was a sharp price decline across the board. This rapid sell-off demonstrated how quickly external, non-crypto-specific events can influence market dynamics and investor behavior. Massive Crypto Liquidations Exceed $1 Billion One of the most dramatic consequences of the sudden price drop was a cascade of crypto liquidations . According to data reported by The Block, citing CoinGlass figures, daily liquidations surged past the $1 billion mark. Liquidations occur in the leveraged trading market. Traders use borrowed funds to increase their position size. If the market moves against their position significantly, their collateral is insufficient to cover potential losses, and the exchange automatically closes their position. The scale of over $1 billion in liquidations within a 24-hour period underscores the severity and speed of the market correction. This event primarily impacted traders holding long positions (betting on prices going up), who were caught off guard by the sharp downturn. Mass liquidations can also exacerbate price falls, as the forced selling adds further downward pressure on the market. Understanding liquidations is crucial for anyone involved in leveraged crypto trading. It highlights the inherent risks associated with using borrowed capital in such a volatile environment. The $1 billion figure serves as a powerful illustration of the financial leverage present in the market and the potential consequences of sudden price swings. Bitcoin Price Fall: A Brief Dip Below $100k As the market reacted to the geopolitical news and subsequent liquidations, the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), experienced a notable Bitcoin price fall . According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin briefly dipped below the significant psychological and technical level of $100,000. This marked the first time BTC had traded below this threshold in approximately 45 days, causing concern among investors who had grown accustomed to its recent stability above this level. While the drop was sharp, Bitcoin showed some resilience, quickly rebounding to trade around $100,735.18 shortly after. This relatively swift recovery from the sub-$100k level suggests underlying buying interest remains, or that the initial panic selling subsided relatively quickly. However, the breach of this key level, even if brief, signals increased volatility and potential uncertainty in the near term. Bitcoin’s ability to hold relatively steadier compared to other assets during such downturns is often attributed to its larger market capitalization and deeper liquidity. However, even the market leader is not immune to significant price movements triggered by major external events. The Altcoin Market Reaction: Bigger Losses While Bitcoin saw a significant price fall, the impact on the broader altcoin market reaction was even more pronounced. Altcoins, which are cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, generally experienced larger percentage losses during this downturn. This is a common pattern observed during crypto market corrections. Why do altcoins often suffer more? Higher Volatility: Altcoins, especially smaller-cap ones, are typically more volatile than Bitcoin. Their prices can swing more dramatically in either direction. Lower Liquidity: Many altcoins have lower trading volumes and less liquidity than Bitcoin. This means that relatively smaller sell orders can have a larger impact on their price. Risk Perception: In a ‘risk-off’ environment, investors tend to flee towards perceived safer assets. Within the crypto space, Bitcoin is often seen as the least risky asset compared to the vast and diverse altcoin market. Leverage: High leverage in altcoin perpetual futures markets can lead to cascading liquidations that accelerate price declines. The recent dip highlighted this disparity, with many altcoins seeing double-digit percentage losses while Bitcoin’s drop was comparatively less severe. This reinforces the idea that while altcoins offer potential for higher returns, they also come with significantly higher risk, particularly during periods of market stress. Impact on Bitcoin ETF Inflows The market dip also coincided with a change in the trend for Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). After a notable nine-day streak of positive inflows, June 20 saw a dip in inflows. Coupled with the subsequent price fall, this suggests the inflow streak may come to an end on June 23, depending on the day’s activity. Consistent ETF inflows have been a significant bullish factor for Bitcoin in recent months, indicating growing institutional and traditional investor interest. A pause or reversal in this trend, even if temporary, could signal a shift in short-term sentiment or a reaction from institutional players to the increased market volatility and the broader geopolitical impact crypto is experiencing. Monitoring ETF flows remains a key indicator for gauging institutional participation and sentiment in the Bitcoin market. Understanding the Geopolitical Impact on Crypto The notion that cryptocurrencies are entirely detached from traditional finance and global politics is increasingly being challenged. While their underlying technology is decentralized, their price is determined by supply and demand within a market that is populated by participants who are also affected by global events. Here’s how geopolitical events can influence crypto: Impact Factor Explanation Risk-Off Sentiment Global instability causes investors to reduce exposure to perceived risky assets, including crypto. Safe-Haven Narrative Conversely, some view Bitcoin as a potential safe haven during times of currency devaluation or political instability, although this narrative is debated and not always reflected in price action during global crises. Sanctions & Regulations Geopolitical conflicts can lead to discussions or implementations of stricter regulations on cryptocurrencies to prevent their use in illicit activities or circumventing sanctions. Economic Uncertainty Events impacting global trade, energy prices, or economic stability can influence overall market liquidity and investor confidence, affecting crypto demand. The recent dip underscores the importance of considering the broader global landscape when analyzing cryptocurrency market movements. While internal factors like technological developments and adoption rates are crucial, external forces can trigger significant and rapid price changes. Conclusion: Navigating Volatility in the Crypto Market The recent crypto market dip , triggered by geopolitical tensions and resulting in over $1 billion in liquidations and a temporary Bitcoin price fall below $100k, serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility in the digital asset space. The amplified altcoin market reaction further highlights the varying risk profiles within the ecosystem. While painful for those caught off guard, such events are not uncommon in this relatively young and rapidly evolving market. Investors should understand that external factors, including geopolitical impact crypto , can significantly influence prices. Managing risk, avoiding excessive leverage, and maintaining a long-term perspective are often cited as prudent strategies when navigating these turbulent periods. As the market digests the impact of recent events, vigilance and informed decision-making remain paramount.

In just two weeks, he lost over $35 million by trading Bitcoin. What’s surprising is that he was often right about market direction, but still walked away with huge losses. So, what exactly went wrong? And what can other traders learn from his mistakes? From $39M to $4M – The Shocking Slide It all began on June 8, when AguilaTrades created a new wallet and moved $39.18 million worth of USDC from Bybit to Hyperliquid, a trading platform used for perpetual BTC contracts. His strategy was bold: he went long on Bitcoin, betting that the price would keep rising. How did AguilaTrades( @AguilaTrades ) lose over $35M in just 2 weeks? 1/ Let's take a closer look at his trades — and see what lessons we can learn. https://t.co/LeSb2QO0PX pic.twitter.com/xt7nGnZJsu — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 23, 2025 Initially, things looked good. On June 9, he opened a large long position on Bitcoin as the price started climbing. His unrealized profits soon reached a peak of $5.76 million. But instead of locking in those gains, he held on, waiting for more. That wait cost him dearly. Ignoring the Signs – And the Losses Pile Up As geopolitical tensions rose due to the Israel-Iran conflict , the price of Bitcoin dropped sharply. Aguila was forced to close his long position, this time with a $12.47 million loss. But he didn’t stop there. Just six days later, on June 15, he went long again. Once more, BTC climbed, and his gains hit $10 million. And once again, he didn’t sell. But, when the market turned, his profits vanished, and he walked away with another $2.95 million in losses. Then came June 20. Another long position. Another rally. Another chance to cash out, this time with $3.2 million in profits. But he didn’t take it. As Bitcoin dropped again , his losses deepened to a painful $17 million. Change in Strategy—But Too Late After three failed long trades, he finally flipped his strategy and went short, betting that Bitcoin would drop. Unfortunately, Bitcoin bounced, and his losses added another $2.33 million.

2025-06-23T09:34:22,"73% of Youngsters Favour Bitcoin for Long-Term Investment Over Gold: Study","A recent poll revealed that investors aged 24 to 45 see Bitcoin as a potential for “exponential upside” over gold. A survey of 730 Gen Z and Millennial investors by financial advisory giant deVere Group found that 73% of respondents preferred Bitcoin. According to deVere CEO, Nigel Green, Bitcoin and gold are not rivals but “ radically different assets ” and solve different problems. “Gold is stability. Bitcoin is growth. If you want to build and protect wealth over the long term, you should be holding both.” The survey aligns with several other studies that imply a seismic shift from traditional investments toward Bitcoin’s dominance as a safe-haven asset. For instance, on-chain analytics company CryptoQuant revealed in January that over 60% of cryptocurrency investors are aged between 25 and 44 years old. “The momentum behind Bitcoin among younger investors is undeniable ,” says Green. “They see it as digital gold – borderless, accessible, and aligned with the future.” Bitcoin Enthusiasm is Growing Younger investors view Bitcoin as a “cornerstone of modern portfolios,” the survey noted . The younger cohort gets attracted to transparency, portability, and potential for exponential surge. Respondents also said that Bitcoin’s operation outside the traditional banking system is a notable advantage. “This generation is right to question the old models. But diversification is timeless,” said Green. Last week, the CEO of Bitwise Asset Management, Hunter Horsley, posted on X, comparing Bitcoin to US Treasuries, rather than gold. “I don’t think Bitcoin’s competition is going to end up being gold,” he wrote. “Rather, I think Bitcoin’s competition is going to end up being U.S. Treasuries and other governments’ bonds.” I don't think Bitcoin's competition is going to end up being gold. They're both apolitical stores of value. Gold lower vol, Bitcoin higher vol. Investors seeking apolitical SOVs will like both. Rather, I think Bitcoin's competition is going to end up being U.S. Treasuries and… — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) June 20, 2025 Gold, Bitcoin Together Offer Balance According to Nigel Green, having uncorrelated assets in portfolios is a pathway for building true resilience. “Gold and Bitcoin together offer that balance,” he said. He also stressed that Bitcoin is moving toward broader acceptance, particularly after spot ETFs and broader corporate adoption, adding legitimacy and fresh demand. “We’re living through a rare convergence,” Green added. “You have the old guard doubling down on gold, and the new guard surging into Bitcoin. Both are being driven by the same core fear: erosion of purchasing power. That should be a wake-up call.” The post 73% of Youngsters Favour Bitcoin for Long-Term Investment Over Gold: Study appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/73-of-youngsters-favour-bitcoin-for-long-term-investment-over-gold-study/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT","Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Gold",cryptocompare

Congratulations on acquiring 1000 BTC. — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 21, 2025 Cardone Capital’s entry into Bitcoin comes as 132 publicly listed companies now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, up from 89 in April. Their combined holdings exceed 800K BTC and are worth over $88 billion. The real estate titan’s decision to pursue 4,000 total Bitcoins represents over $400 million in digital asset exposure at current prices. Source: Cryptonews This institutional adoption wave has accelerated dramatically following Bitcoin’s rally to $111,965 in May, spurring companies across diverse industries to race for Bitcoin exposure while investor appetite remains strong. Institutional Bitcoin Buying Frenzy Reaches $1.5B Monthly Peak June 2025 has witnessed an extraordinary surge in corporate Bitcoin accumulation, with major institutional players deploying over $1.5 billion across multiple high-profile purchases. This represents the largest monthly corporate buying spree in Bitcoin’s history. Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has emerged as the most aggressive buyer, adding 1,111 Bitcoin for $118.2 million just days ago , bringing their total holdings to 11,111 BTC valued at over $1.07 billion. The company’s ambitious 210,000 Bitcoin target by 2027 would represent approximately 1% of Bitcoin’s maximum supply, with CEO Simon Gerovich declaring this “Asia’s largest-ever equity raise to buy Bitcoin.” MicroStrategy continues leading the corporate adoption charge with multiple purchases throughout June, including 10,100 Bitcoin for $1.05 billion , bringing their total holdings to approximately 592,100 BTC worth over $60 billion. The company’s relentless accumulation strategy has inspired a global wave of imitators, with healthcare company Prenetics investing $20 million for 187.42 BTC , Norwegian firm K33 targeting 1,000 BTC through a $9 million share issue, and UK-listed Smarter Web Company adding 45.32 BTC to reach 168.08 total holdings. This buying wave is geographically diverse, spanning Japan’s capital markets to Europe’s regulated exchanges and North America’s public companies. Most notably, Metaplanet’s financing mechanisms include 555 million moving-strike warrants capable of raising $5.4 billion to facilitate massive Bitcoin accumulation strategies. The company’s quarter-to-date Bitcoin yield of 107.9% has attracted significant institutional attention, and its stock has surged over 408% year-to-date. Technical Analysis Reveals Critical Resistance Despite Institutional Support Despite the massive institutional buying pressure, Bitcoin’s technical structure reveals signs of weakness, suggesting the current rally may be losing momentum. Source: TehThomas on TradingView The hourly chart analysis shows Bitcoin experiencing a “fake-out” following an initial sweep higher that failed to sustain momentum. The asset is currently trading around $101,988 after breaking down from an ascending channel pattern. The breakdown of this technical structure occurred despite massive institutional capital injection, indicating that supply pressure from existing holders may be overwhelming the new institutional demand. The 15-minute timeframe provides even more granular evidence of supply-demand imbalance, with Bitcoin trapped within a distribution pattern where red supply zones are successfully containing rallies while demand zones around $98,500-99,500 represent the next major support confluence. The order flow data also reveals a telling pattern of aggressive selling activity at resistance levels above $100,800, with multiple red entries indicating that sellers are using any strength to distribute positions. This suggests that while institutional purchases provide temporary support, the prevailing market structure favors sellers capitalizing on institutional buying to exit positions. The detailed hourly analysis with order flow shows Bitcoin testing the critical $100,000 psychological barrier while facing resistance from the 65-period exponential moving average at $102,451 and the 200-period EMA at $104,109. The time and sales data reveal consistent selling pressure, with green buy entries quickly absorbed by red sell entries at higher price levels. This indicates that institutional buying may occur at technically disadvantageous levels. The combination of broken technical support around $103,000-104,000, bearish moving average configuration, and negative order flow dynamics suggests that Bitcoin could face continued downside pressure toward $98,000-99,000 despite the institutional capital injection.

2025-06-23T09:30:06,"Cardone Capital adds 1,000 bitcoins to its reserve","The CEO of Cardone Capital, Grant Cardone, announced on June 21 that the equity fund manager had fully integrated a Bitcoin strategy by purchasing ~1K BTC. Strategy’s founder and Bitcoin advocate, Michael Saylor, congratulated the move, replying to Cardone with, “Congratulations on acquiring 1000 BTC.” The American real estate mogul revealed that the $5B group currently had over 14.2K units to its name and was looking forward to adding 5K units this year, along with another purchase of about 3K BTC. The strategy combines cash-flowing real estate with Bitcoin’s long-term upside, creating a portfolio that Cardone described as “two best-in-class assets.” The Cardone Capital Group said it was ready to partner with Grant to invest in “cryptorized” real estate. Cardone Capital invests $15.6M in BTC to diversify beyond real estate On June 20th, the group revealed that it acquired 150 BTC worth around $15.6 million as part of its plan to diversify holdings beyond real estate. Grant had claimed almost a week earlier, on June 14th, that real estate market was broken and he was going to fix it using the real estate/BTC model. He said this as the group unveiled a $1.6 billion five-year dual-asset investment strategy that would increase Bitcoin investments and reduce focus on real estate. Grant further explained that this was the fifth fund this year, and the “Boca Deal” was almost filled. A summary infographic report showed that the group planned to reduce real estate allocations from 77% in year one to 45% in year five. It also showed that BTC allocations would increase from 33% to 66% within the same period. The data also revealed that the company had so far invested nearly $100 million in Bitcoin and over $1 billion in real estate, with plans to increase future investments by a minimum of $5 million. According to the Cardone Capital Group, its initial BTC position allocated $290 million to buy 2.914K BTC at an average price of $100K per BTC. The group claimed that additional BTC would be purchased using $140 million of monthly cash flow from real estate holdings within the next five years. The company added that it would invest in institutional-grade cold storage to ensure security and align its long-term BTC hold strategy with macro Bitcoin market cycles. Cardone joins a growing list of institutions adopting Bitcoin reserves A U.S. SEC filing earlier this month revealed that Hong Kong-based real estate and logistics company Reitar Logtech planned to purchase up to $1.5 billion in Bitcoin as part of its treasury diversification strategy. John Chan, Chairman and CEO of Reitar Logtech, said the treasury diversification initiative emphasized his company’s commitment to maintain a strong financial foundation while scaling its global logistics technology platform. DDC Enterprise also raised approximately $528 million to accelerate its Bitcoin treasury strategy. The company’s founder, Chairwoman, and CEO, Norma Chu, said the funding was expected to propel DDC into one of the top global corporate Bitcoin holders. Prenetics also became the first healthcare firm to launch a Bitcoin treasury strategy with a $20 million BTC purchase. The company acquired 187.42 BTC at an average price of $106,712 and stated that its board had approved allocating the majority of its $117 million balance sheet to Bitcoin. Prenetics plans to expand its Bitcoin holdings through institutional capital partnerships and to implement advanced return strategies. It also plans to accept Bitcoin payments across its direct-to-consumer platforms, including IM8 Health and CircleDNA. Metaplanet , Strategy, Tesla, MARA, and others continued to acquire more BTC as two academic researchers, Murray Rudd and Dennis Porter, predicted that Bitcoin could soar to $4.3 million by 2036 if these institutional buying trends continued.

2025-06-23T09:28:45,"Bitcoin Week Ahead: Focus on Powell's Testimony, U.S. Core PCE as Tariff Deadline Looms","The calm in the oil market following the U.S. airstrike on Iran's nuclear sites has dashed the forecasts of bears who predicted a slide in the price of bitcoin BTC. With this in mind, traders can look to the week's major events that could affect markets. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's semi-annual monetary policy testimony to Congress is likely to be the main event. Powell will probably be grilled by Republican party members for not cutting interest rates and ""costing the country hundreds of billions of dollars,"" as President Donald Trump has repeatedly said in his Truth Social posts. Powell, however, is expected to reiterate the Fed's independence and the data-dependent path forward for rates. Traders will closely watch Powell's take on the interest-rate trajectory, given the backdrop of Trump-appointed Fed Governor Christopher Waller's recent comments that interest rates could be reduced in July. ""With the market's pricing of future inflation well anchored, early cracks emerging in the labor market and housing activity evidently weak, there are reasons for the Fed to consider adopting a dovish shift in the July FOMC meeting and guiding towards a cut in September — a path already priced into the U.S. swaps market,"" Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said on X . Dovish hints could prompt more risk-taking in financial markets, boding well for BTC, which has held mainly above $100,000 throughout the recent escalation of conflict in the Middle East. Markets expect the Fed to deliver two 25 basis-point cuts this year, but the take is not unanimous/ ""We continue to think that clarity on the inflation story — whether tariffs are a one-off price shock or if they prompt more sustained inflation pressures — may not come before the December FOMC meeting, meaning we will see just one rate cut this year,"" analysts at ING said in a note to clients Friday. ""However, if the jobs market continues to weaken, that may well be a 50bp cut."" Core PCE On the data front, the core personal-consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, scheduled for release on Friday, is the marquee release. According to Pepperstone, the consensus is for the data to show a 0.1% month-on-month increase in May, resulting in an annualized growth rate of 2.6% and a three-month annualized rate of 1.6%. Expectations of a benign 0.1% increase support the Fed rate cut bets; however, according to ING, the inflationary impact of Trump's tariffs is expected to kick in from July. Trump's 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, announced in early April, is set to expire on July 9, following which the heavy 'Liberation Day' tariffs take effect. So far, the president has made a deal with the U.K. and announced a trade framework with China. Beijing is yet to sign the deal and the European Union remains quiet. Iran tensions are not over yet While the oil market is calm for now, Iran could inflict damage even without closing the Strait of Hormuz, a trade route that carries about a fifth of the world's oil. By constantly threatening the closure of the strait alone, Iran could push up shipping insurance costs, ultimately adding to oil prices. The cost to insure a vessel for the journey via the Strait of Hormuz has already risen from 20 cents a barrel to 80, a report by South China Morning Post said, quoting the Athens-based Xclusiv Shipbrokers. ""By planting enough belief that they could disrupt this key logistical channel, maritime costs could rise to the point that it would have a significant impact on the supply of crude and gas,"" Weston noted.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/23/focus-on-powell-s-testimony-u-s-core-pce-release-as-trump-s-tariff-deadline-looms,"ASIA|BTC|COMMODITY|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Powell|Markets|Inflation|US|Economy|News",cryptocompare

CMC and CoinTelegraph Compromised The warning follows a pair of security breaches that hit the crypto world hard. On June 21, the crypto security tracker @realScamSniffer reported that CoinTelegraph’s frontend had been compromised, with malicious code found in its ad system. CZ quickly responded, linking this to an earlier attack on CoinMarketCap which, importantly, is owned by Binance. “2 days ago CMC, now CT. Hackers are targeting information web sites now. Be careful when authorizing wallet connect,” CZ posted. According to his post, the CMC hack led to 39 victims and a total loss of $18,570. He also confirmed that CoinMarketCap will cover all losses. That’s a small sum by crypto standards, but the method of attack, targeting trusted info sources, is what really matters here. It’s not just wallets and exchanges anymore. Even crypto media isn’t safe. 2 days ago CMC, now CT. Hackers are targeting information web sites now. Be careful when authorizing wallet connect. For CMC, based on initial on-chain analysis, there are 39 victims with a combined loss of $18,570. @CoinMarketCap will cover all losses. https://t.co/egkekyjAYQ — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) June 23, 2025 CZ: “Everything Before an ATH Is a Dip” In a separate tweet, CZ turned to the market – offering a subtle take on where things might be headed next. He didn’t mention Bitcoin directly, but the message was clear: “Everything before a new all-time high is a dip.” That may sound bullish, but CZ added a catch. He said only a small number of strong coins are likely to reach new ATHs. His advice is to look for projects with long-term staying power and real growth potential. For context, Bitcoin’s last ATH was on May 22, when it hit $111,970. CZ Reacts to Elon’s Bold AI Plan CZ also weighed in on another big tech headline. Elon Musk’s announcement about the next version of Grok, his AI chatbot. Musk says Grok will try to rewrite all of human knowledge, correcting errors and adding what’s missing before retraining on the new data. CZ responded, “I look forward [to seeing] how this initiative will play out,” and noted that it’s a “highly debated issue.” He didn’t say more, but the tone suggests he’s watching closely and maybe a bit skeptical. All in All When CZ speaks up – especially on scams, market trends, or major tech moves – it’s worth paying attention. This time, his message is loud and clear: double check what you click, think long-term, and don’t blindly trust the platforms you’ve always used. The game is changing, and the risks are evolving.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/binances-cz-issues-urgent-scam-alert-is-crypto-media-at-risk/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-23T09:26:01,"Bitcoin Recovers from Dip Under $100K After US Attack on Iran – Why BTC Bull Token Could Explode Next","Bitcoin ($BTC) bounced back to $101K late Sunday, shaking off losses incurred after US and Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites early that morning. Amid the chaos, BitMEX’s Arther Hayes predicted that $BTC will rebound thanks to ‘its safe haven status.’ As $BTC looks to strengthen its position as a store of value, now could be a prime time to eye BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) , one of the best long-term crypto to hold . $BTCBULL will distribute free $BTC when the #1 crypto reaches key targets. As such, you can capitalize on the success of the world’s largest crypto, now worth ~$102K , for less than a cent. $BTC Survives Geopolitical Shock, Holds Key Support Levels Over the weekend, $BTC briefly dipped below $98.5K following US and Israeli airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities. Dubbed ‘Operation Midnight Hammer,’ the strikes targeted key sites in Iran’s nuclear infrastructure – Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan – using more than 125 warplanes and bunker-buster munitions. The shockwaves rippled through the crypto market. Yesterday, $ETH plunged ~10% , and assets like $SOL, $XRP, and $DOGE fell to multi-month lows. $BTC, however, rebounded quickly. After dropping from a ~$103K high to a ~$98K low, it has since stabilized at ~$102K. Ahead of Bitcoin’s rebound, Hayes suggested that further money printing will prompt investors to turn to $BTC to protect against inflation. Additionally, 0x Research’s Markus Thielen said that as long as $BTC remains above the short-term realized price of $98K and the $100K trend support, ‘ traders can continue to look for tactical rally opportunities .’ Crypto trader DonAlt also noted that $BTC is mimicking gold’s 2024 breakout , consolidating below key resistance before a potential surge. If history repeats itself, it could be on the verge of a major move. As $BTC strengthens its position as digital gold, $BTCBULL offers a way to tap into the OG coin’s upside every time it climbs. $BTCBULL Raises $7.3M+ Ahead of Handing Out $BTC $BTCBULL is gaining significant traction, having already snagged over $7.3M on presale. It’s attracting hype over the real $BTC airdrops it offers when the crypto leader hits major milestones: $150K and $200K. Plus, when $BTC hits $250K, holders can claim a share of a massive 2.1B $BTCBULL airdrop. Since Hayes predicts $BTC could hit $250K by this year’s end, these rewards might be just around the corner. To qualify for the airdrops, you only need to hold $BTCBULL in Best Wallet , a top non-custodial crypto wallet . To enjoy lower fees while using the wallet, purchase a bit of $BEST , its native token. To earn more passive income, you can stake $BTCBULL at a commendable 56% APY. $BTCBULL also has planned deflationary token burns at $125K, $175K, and $225K, aiming to reduce supply and potentially boost its value. With whales dropping $31.9K , $20K , and $14.3K into the presale recently, major industry players clearly see $BTCBULL as having serious upside potential. Win Free $BTC as It Solidifies Its Role as a Safe-Haven Asset $BTC’s swift recovery after a significant black swan event shows how resilient it is as a safe-haven asset. With Hayes, Thielen, and DonAlt all pointing to bullish $BTC signals, market momentum is building. If their predictions hold, the next big breakout could be moments away. As such, there’s no better time to grab some $BTCBULL and earn free $BTC when it hits new highs. You can buy $BTCBULL on presale for just $0.002575. If market conditions remain favorable, it could reach $0.06467 by year’s end , marking an ROI of 2,411%. This isn’t financial advice.

2025-06-23T09:22:15,"R. Kiyosaki warns of ‘global monetary collapse’","Robert Kiyosaki , the outspoken author of Rich Dad Poor Dad and longtime critic of fiat monetary systems, has reignited debate over the future of global finance with a bold new warning issued via X on June 23. Labeling the current environment as the “biggest debt bubble in history,” Kiyosaki cautioned that a global monetary collapse may be on the near horizon, and that only those holding tangible, hard assets will avoid being caught flat-footed. “GLOBAL MONETARY COLLAPSE COMING?” he wrote. “Will you be richer or poorer when the biggest debt bubble in history bursts? I recommend owning gold, silver, and BITCOIN… Biggest losers will be savers of fake fiat money and especially bonds.” While Kiyosaki has long been critical of fiat currency debasement and central bank interventionism, this most recent statement signals a sharpening of tone. Rather than positioning collapse as a long-tail risk, he now frames it as an imminent systemic event, raising the stakes for passive investors still parked in government paper or low-yielding cash. Gold and Bitcoin on hold, Silver takes center stage In a follow-up post later that day, Kiyosaki clarified his tactical allocation: “Silver is the best investment today… June 2025. Gold and Bitcoin are high and I am waiting for a correction before adding more.” FYI: Silver is the best investment today….june 2025. Gold and Bitcoin are high and I am waiting for gold and Bitcoin to crash before I add to my position. That’s what I think. Do your own research. Take care. — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 23, 2025 This shift is notable. While Kiyosaki remains structurally bullish on both gold and Bitcoin ( BTC ), his current focus on silver suggests a conviction that the market is underpricing its monetary and industrial role. Silver remains significantly below its inflation-adjusted high of $50, and despite strong fundamentals, including tightening supply and surging demand for industrial applications, it continues to trade with elevated volatility and low institutional positioning.

2025-06-23T09:20:50,"These 4 meme coins will outperform BTC once Fed starts cutting rates","If the Federal Reserve slows rate hikes and finally signals cuts, the crypto market could erupt—and meme coins might be leading the charge. Bitcoin is a slow-moving mothership. It moves billions, but the real fireworks often come from the meme coin trenches when markets shift to a risk-on stance. These tokens have rabid fan bases, cult-like communities, and social media buzz strong enough to move markets. And with the Fed hinting at a potential pivot, meme coins are entering full pre-pump mode. Here are four meme coins perfectly positioned to outrun Bitcoin in a rate-cut rally—and they’re not waiting around for the party to start. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): A meme chain built to moon Stage 3 of its presale is live, and at just $0.0012 per token, it’s setting the pace for 2025’s biggest meme-driven breakout. This isn’t your typical frog-themed gamble. LILPEPE is launching its own dedicated Layer-2 blockchain, explicitly built for memes. It features anti-bot technology, ultra-low fees, and a launchpad allowing communities to create meme tokens in minutes. It’s like PEPE but with infrastructure. Presale momentum is electric. Over $1.4 million has been raised already in Stage 3, with 1.3 billion tokens sold in under 24 hours. And if that wasn’t enough, the team has just announced a jaw-dropping $777,000 giveaway, with 10 lucky winners each receiving $ 77,000 in $LILPEPE . You must complete a few social tasks and earn big while you share the word. With a starting price under a penny, upcoming exchange listings, and a real Layer-2 chain in the works, LILPEPE could dwarf Bitcoin’s upside in the short term. If BTC pulls a 2x on rate cuts, LILPEPE could pull a 200x. BONK: Solana’s wildcard with real volume What makes BONK special is its community. The project sits squarely inside Solana’s ecosystem, buzzing on Twitter and Discord, and already plays nice with Solana NFTs and DeFi. Its branding is sharp, the memes hit hard, and the growing social hype isn’t just smoke. OKX even praised Bonk’s “creative energy and active user base” as key drivers of growth. BONK still trades under a penny, but analysts are targeting late 2025 levels near $0.0000288, which represents a nearly 2x increase from current levels. If the Fed loosens up and the market swings to a risk-on stance, BONK could ride Solana’s wave straight to new highs. Think of it as Dogecoin’s younger, faster cousin—and one with way more left in the tank. FLOKI Inu: The veteran with the Viking Army Currently, FLOKI boasts a $730 million market capitalization and a daily trading volume of $37 million. However, what truly sets it apart is the ecosystem it’s built: a play-to-earn game (Valhalla), a DeFi suite (FlokiFi), a merchandise and NFT marketplace, and even a crypto education platform. The community has helped push FLOKI to multiple all-time highs, and with 20% of the supply staked, the loyalty runs deep. Stakers are even earning up to 20% APY—try getting that from your bank if the Fed cuts rates. Speculators believe FLOKI could easily double or triple from current levels in a bull run, and with Elon’s dog as its namesake, the meme fuel is limitless. FARTCOIN: The wildcard going full gas Born on Solana, driven by humor, and fueled by viral AI backstories, this coin exploded in late 2024 with a 370% pump from its lows—and it hasn’t slowed down since. And when word dropped that Coinbase might list FARTCOIN, the price rocketed past $1, pushing the market cap over $1 billion. FARTCOIN now has a passionate base, real volume, and the kind of chart setup meme traders live for (rounded bottom, clean breakout, and loads of liquidity). In a meme-fueled bull run, this could be 2025’s most ridiculous—and most profitable—ride. Final thought: Meme coins were built for Fed pivots Bitcoin might be the store of value, but meme coins are the store of velocity. If the Fed starts cutting rates, expect retail to go wild—and these four tokens are sitting at the intersection of utility, narrative, and sheer meme magic. If you’re waiting for a signal, this is it. LILPEPE, BONK, FLOKI, and FARTCOIN are warming up for liftoff.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, the Rich Dad Poor Dad Author tells his 2.7 million followers that 2025 will bring the greatest economic crash of all time due to several factors, such as rampant inflation and artificial intelligence (AI) taking over jobs. According to Kiyosaki, the way to survive during such perilous times would be to stack gold, silver and Bitcoin ( BTC ). “The biggest crash in history is upon the world now…..2025. Millions are losing their jobs due to AI. Inflation is stealing the retirements of millions of baby boomers. Please be aware of the millions of ‘false prophets’ on YouTube and in our schools. The idea of going to school to find a safe, secure job is for losers. My solution remains the same. Choose your teachers wisely, on YouTube, and save gold, silver, and Bitcoin. Please take care. 2025 is the year representing the biggest change in world financial history. Be a winner. Not a highly educated loser, looking for job security with thousands in student loan debt.” Kiyosaki goes on to note that investors shouldn’t be worried about the price of gold, silver, or BTC and instead should just focus on the quantity they have. “Poor people focus on price. Rich people on quantity. I do not care much about the spot price of gold or silver. I do care about how many ounces of gold and silver I control. The same with Bitcoin. While I watch the price of Bitcoin, I focus on how many Bitcoin I own. I started buying Bitcoin at $6,000. I bought all I could. I wish I had more fake money to buy more Bitcoin. In 2030 the probability is Bitcoin will be $1 million a coin. While price is important…. the rich will still be those with the most Bitcoin. How many ounces of gold and silver and Bitcoin do you own? The quantity you own is more important for your future than the prices.” BTC is trading for $101,874 at time of writing.

2025-06-23T09:14:07,"Michael Saylor Hints at More Bitcoin Buys as Strategy Faces Investor Lawsuits","Michael Saylor, executive chairman of the company now known as Strategy, has once again signaled a potential Bitcoin acquisition. On Sunday, Saylor posted a chart on X displaying his firm’s historic Bitcoin purchases with the cryptic caption: “Nothing Stops This Orange.” The statement echoes similar past posts that preceded major Bitcoin buys. The post comes amid legal troubles for Saylor and Strategy’s top leadership, who are facing multiple lawsuits from investors. The firm reported a staggering $5.9 billion unrealized loss on its Bitcoin holdings in its first-quarter earnings, triggering sharp criticism and legal scrutiny. Despite the turmoil, Strategy remains the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin , owning 592,100 BTC valued at around $59.7 billion, with Bitcoin currently trading just under $101,000. Lawsuit Claims Misleading Statements by Strategy and Execs Just days before Saylor’s post, an investor named Abhey Parmar filed a derivative lawsuit in a Virginia federal court against Strategy, Saylor, CEO Phong Le, CFO Andrew Kang, and four board members. The suit alleges the executives breached their fiduciary duties by failing to properly disclose the impact of a new accounting rule that led to the multibillion-dollar paper loss. The complaint claims that Strategy adopted a Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rule in January that allowed companies to report the fair market value of cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets. While this change was expected to improve transparency, Parmar alleges it instead resulted in a massive $5.9 billion unrealized loss when reported in April, causing Strategy’s stock to fall nearly 9%. Further, the lawsuit accuses Strategy’s executives of selling company shares worth approximately $31.5 million before the accounting change’s full impact was made public. Parmar asserts these trades were executed while the stock was “artificially inflated,” suggesting possible insider trading. Second Lawsuit Adds Pressure Adding to the company’s legal challenges, Strategy is also facing a proposed class-action lawsuit filed in May by another investor, Anas Hamza. This suit similarly accuses the company of misrepresenting the risks tied to Bitcoin volatility and failing to adequately explain the implications of adopting the new FASB rule. In response, the firm stated in a regulatory filing that it “intends to vigorously defend against these claims.” Despite the legal headwinds, Saylor’s continued bullish stance hints that the company may soon expand its already massive Bitcoin treasury.

2025-06-23T09:00:44,"Crypto Bull Run Over? Here’s What A Top Trader Just Said","With Bitcoin precariously recovering above the $100,000 mark and altcoins bleeding momentum, traders are asking the obvious: Is the crypto bull run over? According to systematic trader Adam Bakay (@abetrade), the answer is not so clear-cut. In a detailed market breakdown posted June 22, Bakay offered a technically grounded, cautiously defensive assessment—one that acknowledges geopolitical risks but stays rooted in positioning and price structure. Is The Bitcoin Bull Run Over? “Looking at the monthly and weekly timeframes, we are still technically in an uptrend,” Bakay wrote, noting that “no key swing low was broken, and the 365-day rolling VWAP has been respected during the pullback in April.” Despite this, he admits that “the failure to make new all-time highs similar to the top in 2021” is a concern—especially given the accumulation by players like BlackRock, which now holds around 3.5% of Bitcoin’s total supply. It’s that divergence—between strong institutional interest and a market struggling to break higher—that has made Bakay more cautious in recent weeks. “This is why I have been very defensive and kept most of my trades short-term,” he said. Related Reading: Crypto Gets A Green Light From Spanish Banking Giant His trading view focuses on two potential technical scenarios: either a reclaim of the $100,000 support area—“likely if the conflict in the Middle East does not further escalate”—or a dip into the $97,000–$95,000 range, where strong technical support resides in the form of the 200-day moving average, local price structure, and the 90-day rolling VWAP. Still, Bakay made it clear he’s not shorting the market. “I am not currently considering any short trades due to my current positioning,” he emphasized, adding that open interest is dropping and that we are starting to see the “first signs of clear spot bid interest since the April lows.” The options market, meanwhile, is flashing early caution: the 25-delta risk reversal skew sits around -5, not yet at panic levels, but trending more negative. Crypto Bull Run In Jeopardy On Ethereum, Bakay was notably blunt. “ETH almost had its moment, but of course had to become a disappointment,” he said. He attributes the failed breakout in part to how quickly the “DeFi Summer 2025” narrative went viral. “People are getting too horny, and market made sure to punish them,” he noted, referencing his own tweet from a few days earlier. Related Reading: Crypto’s Unlikely Ally: Top Analyst Reveals War As A Surprising Bullish Force The technical picture on ETH doesn’t inspire confidence either. “During significant market moves, like we had at the beginning of May, the last thing you want to see is price retracing throughout that area,” he explained, saying the next meaningful support lies near $1,800. On the daily chart, Ethereum is sitting right at a confluence of support—both the 90-day rolling VWAP and what he calls a “pivotal level.” Still, much like Bitcoin, Bakay sees Ethereum’s short-term fate as largely dependent on developments in the Middle East. On positioning, ETH also shows signs of an oversold environment, though Bakay believes high volatility in ETH options has caused traders to use spreads instead of outright directional bets. “Positioning is now very clearly pointing towards the possible upside reversal in both perpetual and spot,” he said. Altcoins received no reprieve. “Altcoins have not been having fun for quite a while,” Bakay wrote, pointing out that “every time it starts to look better, it will almost immediately get worse.” He notes that the expected rotation from Bitcoin into altcoins hasn’t materialized, and the real rotation now seems to be into crypto-related equities, which better reflect the ETF-driven macro trade. Even strong names like Solana are fading. “SOL has almost retraced the entire rally from April,” he warned. The key level to watch is $100. “There is not much of a technical support sub-$100,” and if “shit hits the fan,” Bakay would look to bid around that round number. Bakay also briefly touched on two newer altcoins—Hype and Fartcoin—saying one offers a solid product and the other draws interest through volatility and liquidity. “Fartcoin would become attractive if it could reclaim the $1 or $0.50 area. Hype could find a bounce sub-$30.” His closing thoughts were pragmatic: “We are not in easy market conditions, with a lot of geopolitical uncertainty, and markets can be significantly affected by a single news release.” While he believes the market may be “getting too short at the moment,” he remains highly conscious of the possibility that a multi-month correction is already in play. “I don’t think there is a need to be a hero and try to catch a falling knife,” he concluded. “I would much rather wait for some positive news and signs of lower timeframe reversals.” In essence, Bakay doesn’t call the top. But his post makes one thing clear: this is not a market for bravado. It’s a time for restraint, tight risk management, and respect for volatility—especially when the bullish case no longer has momentum on its side. At press time, BTC traded at $101,847.

2025-06-23T08:39:41,"This is Why Bitcoin is Dumping?","The post This is Why Bitcoin is Dumping? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market just got hit hard, dropping to $3.12 trillion, while Bitcoin has plunged below the $100,000 mark , marking its lowest level since early May. This recent drop came in response to the escalating Iran-Israel war, with the U.S. stepping in between. This has led Iran to close the Strait of Hormuz for the first time since 1972, triggering a sharp dip in Bitcoin’s price. So, what’s the connection between the Strait of Hormuz and a crypto crash? Let’s break it down. Geopolitical Tension Hits Bitcoin $100k The most recent reason behind the bitcoin price crash was that Iran’s parliament has approved a move to block the Strait of Hormuz —a vital passage for about 20% to 30% of the world’s oil supply, which has rattled global markets. While the decision hasn’t been finalized yet, if closed, then the shipments of 20 plus million barrels of oil per day will be affected and will surge the oil price, possibly even hitting $100 per barrel. In fact, according to JP Morgan estimates, a closure of the Strait of Hormuz could send oil prices to $120-$130/barrel. This would imply a spike in US CPI inflation to ~5%. The last time we saw US inflation at 5% was in March 2023, when the Fed was aggressively hiking rates. pic.twitter.com/SwhsQZ1vzS — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) June 22, 2025 A spike in oil typically leads to inflation fears and pushes investors away from risky assets like Bitcoin. As a result, Bitcoin broke below the $100,000 mark after holding strong for 45 days. This break triggered concern across the crypto space, especially among traders with high-leverage positions. Chart Patterns Confirm the Fear According to crypto analyst CryptoKid , Bitcoin is showing clear signs of weakness. On the BTC chart, a “double top” pattern has formed, a bearish signal, along with a drop below key support levels. Because of this, analysts are now keeping an eye on the next important price zones. If Bitcoin continues falling, the next likely support levels are around $97,600 and $93,100 based on Fibonacci retracement levels. There’s also growing concern that Bitcoin could fall to $91,960, where a CME gap still exists. If that happens, it might lead to more panic selling and liquidations in the market. Altcoins in the Danger Zone Too With the bitcoin price hitting hard, altcoins are also seeing some heat. Meanwhile, altcoins like Solana, Dogecoin, and AVAX are also on thin ice as the price has seen in drop of 10%. However, the prices are approaching extreme lows—levels not seen since the last bear market. While some see it as a buying opportunity, Crypto Kid advises caution and reducing leverage during uncertain times.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/this-is-why-bitcoin-is-dumping/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|COMMODITY|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-23T08:38:26,"How Low Can Bitcoin Go? Arthur Hayes Says the Bottom May Be Close","The post How Low Can Bitcoin Go? Arthur Hayes Says the Bottom May Be Close appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The entire crypto markets were rocked after the U.S. military launched airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, causing over $1 billion in crypto liquidations . Bitcoin plunged to $99,000, breaking a 44-day streak above six figures. Meanwhile, the crypto has since been consolidating in a downward channel. Key levels to watch are $100K and $92K for support, with resistance near $107K and $112K. The fear of escalating war, possibly triggered by Donald Trump, sent both crypto and traditional markets into turmoil. War = Volatility… and Printing? Despite the chaos, Altcoin Daily analysts believe this dip is a buying opportunity. Historically, markets have rallied during wars due to increased government spending and money printing. While a full-scale war is unlikely, any de-escalation could trigger a major relief rally. Bitcoin dipping into the low $90K, or even $80K, would not break market structure, the analyst insists. Do you hear that? … it’s the sound of the money printers revving up to do their patriotic duty. This weakness shall pass and $BTC will leave no doubt as to its safe haven status. pic.twitter.com/PTfZaAXFp7 — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) June 22, 2025 Arthur Hayes, Co-Founder of BitMEX, suggests that central banks are preparing to print more money in response to current market weakness. He believes this will strengthen Bitcoin’s position as a safe haven asset, saying BTC will soon prove its true value. Short-term Haul? However, Glassnode reports that since April, Bitcoin corrections have repeatedly bounced off the Short-Term Holder Realized Price, the average cost basis for investors holding under 155 days. However, the STH-MVRV has now dropped to just 0.03, indicating that recent buyers are sitting on only 3% unrealized gains, reflecting growing pressure on newer investors. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : MetaPlanet Adds 1,111 More Bitcoins, Now Holds Over $1 Billion in BTC , Middle East & Global Bitcoin Adoption Surges The Middle East continues to embrace crypto. Sovereign wealth funds from Saudi Arabia to Bahrain are investing heavily in blockchain for national infrastructure. Meanwhile, Russia reportedly holds over $25 billion in crypto assets, quietly building its strategic reserves. The video highlights how Bitcoin is increasingly being treated like “physical gold,” especially during times of uncertainty. More billionaires, including Mexico’s third-richest man, are looking to buy Bitcoin, with some holding 80% of their portfolio in BTC and miners. U.S. states like Texas, Arizona, and New Hampshire are also launching strategic Bitcoin reserves, signaling long-term institutional confidence . Bitcoin’s Future Still Bright Analyst emphasizes that nothing has fundamentally changed about Bitcoin or crypto. The fear-driven dip should be seen as a temporary shakeout. With blockchain adoption rising globally, governments printing more money, and increasing institutional demand, the long-term thesis for Bitcoin remains bullish .

Here’s What You Need to Know!","The post Bitcoin Price Prediction: Is BTC Price Gearing Up for a 10% Pullback? Here’s What You Need to Know! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The market conditions appear to have varied a bit as the bearish dominance is slowly outweighing the bullish impact on the Bitcoin price . The token, which briefly plunged below $100K, now appears to be due for another 5% to 8% pullback, which certainly cannot be a major red flag. After a strong rally, some cooling off is normal, and several signals suggest it may be on the way. Momentum is decelerating, trading activity is shifting, and investors’ sentiment is slightly more cautious. In the times when the prices are still holding strong above key support levels, a dip around $92,000 to $95,000 could be considered a healthy correction. But the question arises whether this could give the market a chance to rest before the next move up, or will it lead to a deeper correction? Long-Term Holders & Institutions Remain Optimistic The external factors have been making a huge impact on crypto markets, especially on Bitcoin prices in recent times. With the war-like situation escalating, the risk assets have been facing the heat. Back in 2024, the BTC price experienced significant upward pressure for a week to 10 days, which resulted in a massive breakout ahead. Therefore, it is believed that the correction below $100K could be a massive bullish signal. This could be the reason that the long-term holders continue to accumulate more Bitcoin! On the other hand, the price drop has not stopped the institutions from accumulating Bitcoin. As per the latest update, Metaplanet bought 1,111 BTC while a Florida-based investment firm, Cardone Capital, added nearly 1,000 BTC and plans to add more than 3,000 BTC this year. Coming to the ETFs, Blackrock accumulated over 11,000 BTC throughout the past week, while ~3500 BTC were mined. This suggests institutions are optimistic about the BTC price rally, which suggests greener days ahead. Is Bitcoin Heading Back Below $100K? The Bitcoin price has reached one of the crucial support zones after plunging by more than 8% from the recent highs above $110K. The current market conditions and the trade patterns suggest the selling pressure has not yet faded. Hence, a deeper correction could be on the horizon, with the levels dropping as low as $92,000 in the coming days. As seen in the above chart, the BTC price is struggling to revive a strong upswing from the support zone; it has been stuck after the pullback. The Supertrend has changed to bearish, which could make the bullish divergence even more tedious, while the RSI is forming lower highs and lows, validating a bearish continuation. Overall trend of Bitcoin remains bearish technically, but a notable influx of buying pressure could nullify the bearish pressure. However, considering the current market conditions, it appears unlikely, as the BTC price could be about to drop below $100K. There is support at $98,817, which was tested recently, and another visit could probably break it. This could pave the way for the token to mark new monthly lows at the lower support zone around $93,500. Therefore, the upcoming monthly close could be pretty bearish, which may attract new opportunities to enter.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-price-prediction-is-btc-price-gearing-up-for-a-10-pullback-heres-what-you-need-to-know/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-06-23T08:29:44,"Pay with Crypto Like a Pro: How SpacePay Fits Right into Your Local Store","The post Pay with Crypto Like a Pro: How SpacePay Fits Right into Your Local Store appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ever tried paying with Bitcoin at the grocery store? The cashier looks at you like you just asked to trade seashells for milk, calls over a supervisor who’s just as confused, and you end up swiping your debit card like nothing happened. That’s been the reality of crypto payments for most people. SpacePay is actually fixing this mess. Their payment platform works with the card machines shops already have, connects to more than 325 crypto wallets, and instantly converts crypto to cash so merchants don’t have to worry about price swings. The London startup has pulled in over $1.1 million so far in their presale, with $SPY tokens going for $0.003181 right now. Finally, Crypto That Works in Real Stores Here’s the thing about most crypto payment solutions – they’re built by tech people for tech people. Store owners take one look at the setup requirements and run the other way. Who wants to buy expensive new equipment and train staff on some complicated system? SpacePay figured out the obvious solution everyone else missed. Instead of forcing businesses to replace their payment terminals, they made their system work with the Android machines already sitting on counters everywhere. Just a software update, and suddenly that same old card reader can handle Bitcoin payments. The customer experience is pretty smooth too. You just scan a QR code with whatever crypto wallet you’re already using, double-check the amount, and tap to pay. Takes about as long as using Apple Pay. No fumbling around with long wallet addresses or standing there awkwardly while some transaction processes for five minutes. Honestly, it seems so simple that you’d expect someone to have done this years ago. Businesses keep their equipment, customers use their existing wallets, and everyone’s happy. https://twitter.com/SpacePayLtd/status/1933247245706469417 Merchants Don’t Have to Become Crypto Traders Ask any shop owner why they won’t accept Bitcoin, and they’ll probably mention the price swings. Nobody wants to sell a $100 item for Bitcoin in the morning, then find out it’s only worth $85 by lunchtime because the market had another one of its episodes. SpacePay handles this perfectly. When someone pays with crypto, the merchant gets regular money in their account right away. That $100 sale stays $100, period. Doesn’t matter if Bitcoin decides to crash or moon five minutes later. The way it works is pretty clever. SpacePay locks in the exchange rate for those few seconds while the payment processes. If the market goes crazy during that tiny window, they eat the difference. The shop owner just sees a normal payment hitting their account. This removes the biggest excuse merchants have for avoiding crypto. They don’t need to understand blockchain technology or follow crypto news. They just get paid in dollars like always, except now they can serve customers who prefer digital money. Visit SpacePay Presale Saving Money on Those Annoying Processing Fees Credit card companies have been taking their cut for so long that most people just accept it as the cost of doing business. But those 2.5% to 3.5% fees really add up. A small restaurant doing $40,000 a month in sales is handing over more than $1,000 just in processing fees. SpacePay charges 0.5%. Same restaurant would pay $200 instead. That’s $800 extra every month that could go toward better ingredients, staff bonuses, or actually fixing that broken freezer. The savings work because SpacePay cuts out all the middlemen. With regular credit cards, your payment bounces around between banks and processors, with everyone taking their piece. SpacePay creates a more direct route using blockchain tech, so there are fewer hands in the cookie jar. Small businesses are getting hit with higher costs left and right these days, so every dollar they can keep matters. That extra cash might be what lets them hire another employee instead of working seven days a week, or finally replace equipment that’s been held together with duct tape. Every Crypto Wallet Actually Works Most crypto payment systems are picky about which wallets they support. You might have Bitcoin in one wallet and Ethereum in another, but the store only accepts payments from three specific apps you’ve never heard of. SpacePay works with over 325 different wallets. Whether you’re team MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or something more obscure, you can probably pay with what you’ve got. No downloading new apps or moving funds around just to buy a sandwich. This matters more than you might think. People get attached to their wallets, especially if they’ve got everything set up just right. Making them switch to pay at your store is asking for trouble. Better to meet customers where they are. The platform handles different cryptocurrencies without making a fuss about it. Bitcoin fans, Ethereum holders, and people into the newer coins can all shop at the same places. Pretty much everyone wins. Getting Started with SpacePay Anyone curious about the SpacePay ecosystem can check out their ongoing presale. Head to their official website and connect whatever crypto wallet you normally use. They accept ETH, BNB, MATIC, AVAX, BASE, USDT, and USDC for payments, or you can even use a regular bank card if you haven’t jumped into crypto yet. After picking how many tokens you want, just follow the steps to complete your purchase. Your $SPY tokens will sit safely in your wallet until the presale wraps up. At $0.003181 per token currently, people are getting in before the price likely increases in later presale stages.

2025-06-23T08:28:37,"Norwegian Mining Company Green Minerals Plans $1.2B Raise to Build Bitcoin Reserve","Norwegian deep-sea mining firm Green Minerals said Monday it plans to start buying Bitcoin as part of a broader push into blockchain, with a goal of raising up to $1.2b to expand its Bitcoin reserve. The move reflects growing corporate interest in using Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and monetary instability. In a statement , the Norwegian company said it has adopted a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy to diversify away from fiat currencies and strengthen its balance sheet. Green Minerals Touts Bitcoin as a Hedge Against Currency Debasement Executive Chairman Ståle Rodahl described the approach as a natural fit for a business with long-term capital needs and a forward-looking outlook. Bitcoin’s non-inflationary nature, he said, offered protection against currency debasement at a time of “significant monetary expansion.” Green Minerals plans to acquire its first bitcoins in the coming days and will work with industry specialists to develop a transparent and secure framework for managing the holdings. The company will also introduce a new metric, Bitcoin per share, or BTC/share, to give shareholders a clear view of the digital asset value tied to their equity. Firm Says Bitcoin Will Strengthen Capital Access Without Shifting Its Mission Green Minerals said that the strategy complements, rather than replaces, its core operations. The Bitcoin reserves are meant to help fund large-scale equipment needs and project development over time. The company also sees blockchain as a tool for improving transparency in mineral sourcing, supply chain integrity and regulatory compliance, key areas where Norwegian mining companies are under increasing scrutiny. This financing push will be part of a wider capital program, launched under its Partnership for Responsible Production, which sees digital assets as an integral part of its growth model. The firm believes Bitcoin can serve as both a treasury asset and a lever for accessing capital markets more efficiently. Green Minerals Taps Into Trend of Listed Firms Using Bitcoin for Growth Green Minerals joins a growing number of publicly traded firms adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset. According to Standard Chartered, more than 60 non-crypto companies have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets in recent years, following the path laid by MicroStrategy. That firm’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy, begun in 2020, helped send its stock price up more than 3,000%. For companies like Green Minerals, Bitcoin exposure offers something individual investors cannot easily replicate. Public firms can often raise capital through convertible debt markets, enabling them to acquire larger positions in Bitcoin at scale. This ability, coupled with their stocks often trading at a premium to underlying crypto assets, makes corporate adoption a powerful financial play.

2025-06-23T08:24:07,"Every Bank and Fintech Wants DeFi Under the Hood: Alchemy","Ever since President Donald Trump's administration signaled favorable crypto regulations, banks, financial institutions and big fintech firms have been looking to bring funds on-chain, and seamlessly offer compliant access to decentralized finance (DeFi), according to blockchain development firm Alchemy. DeFi, traditionally a way for anonymous users to engage in a complex system of automated lending and borrowing of assets, can bring to a whole new audience of users to conventional finance (TradFi), with the possibility of compliance guardrails in place and abstracting away the headache of dealing in smart contracts. The common pattern is best described as growing a “DeFi mullet,” according to Alchemy, a picks and shovels provider for blockchain builders that has been described as the “ AWS of crypto ,” a reference to Amazon Web Services, the ubiquitous cloud computing platform that powers much of today's internet. “I see firms like Fidelity, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Revolut and Robinhood, who are all at different stages of evolution, but who all want to allow their users to take their funds, like their USD or like fiat money funds, and then use DeFi tools,” Alchemy CTO Guillaume Poncin said in an interview. “The common pattern is best described by the term ‘DeFi mullet.’ These are the most interesting use cases, I think, where you can use DeFi under the hood, and the user doesn't even really need to know that that's happening,” Poncin said. A concrete example of this type of thing is the way users of U.S.-listed exchange Coinbase (COIN) can easily get loans in exchange for locking up their bitcoin BTC, a type of margin loan that retail investors don't normally get access to, Poncin pointed out. “Now it should be possible for Fidelity to offer these types of margin loans against your money-market fund account, as an example,” Poncin said. “All of this is plumbed into [crypto] wallets and DeFi, so that as a user, it's just one click. You want a loan against your Vanguard holdings? Here is a loan.” “I think a lot of fintechs are looking at that as a great proof of concept of what can be done. if you're tokenizing your money-market fund or tokenizing your other assets, private equity, whatever, eventually what you want is to give your users utility over that. And the utility vehicle is DeFi.” Alchemy appeared around five years ago, offering a developer platform for firms looking to build large scale blockchain operations. The firm went on to offer programmable links between programs known as APIs, allowing for data indexing, smart contract automation and smart wallets that feel invisible and intuitive, Poncin said. APIs, in effect, put the software plumbing behind the scenes and ease the burden on end users. “The old school way with blockchain wallets would involve installing Metamask, but that’s a very cumbersome process,” Poncin said. “The new trend is, if you are Nike or Stripe, you want to provide crypto wallets to your users they don't even know about; they're completely invisible under-the-hood wallets.” CORRECT (June 23, 08:52 UTC): Corrects spelling of Revolut in fourth paragraph.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/06/23/every-bank-and-fintech-wants-defi-under-the-hood-alchemy,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT","Finance|Alchemy|Interviews|DeFi|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-23T08:21:54,"Bitcoin v. gold is ‘canary in the coal mine’ about to drop, warns strategist","Bloomberg Intelligence senior commodity strategist Mike McGlone has warned that Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) weakening performance relative to gold could be signaling deeper trouble for U.S. equities and broader risk assets. In his bearish outlook, McGlone pointed to the falling Bitcoin-to-gold ratio as a potential “canary in the coal mine.” He emphasized that the 33x level on this ratio is a critical threshold for maintaining investor confidence in riskier markets, as per his X post on June 22. “Falling Bitcoin vs. gold could be a canary in the coal mine for risk assets, putting an inordinate burden on the cross to stay above 33x,” he said. The caution comes amid a backdrop of historic market turmoil. Specifically, the S&P 500 fell nearly 20% in the first half of the year, wiping out around $13 trillion in market capitalization, over 40% of U.S. GDP. Bitcoin and gold ratio chart. Source: Bloomberg Intelligence McGlone noted this marked the largest GDP-relative loss for a 20% correction in nearly a century, highlighting the severity of current market conditions. He backed his concerns with a comparison where the stocks have surged to record highs, but the Bitcoin/gold ratio has stumbled. Investors losing faith in Bitcoin? This divergence suggests that while equity valuations remain elevated, investors are losing faith in Bitcoin as a high-beta, risk-on asset, especially compared to gold’s safe-haven appeal. McGlone warned that unless Bitcoin begins to regain ground against gold, further declines in equities and speculative assets may follow. So far in 2025, gold has emerged as one of the year’s top-performing assets, with investors seeking refuge amid persistent uncertainty. Safe-haven demand has been fueled by rising trade tensions and escalating conflict in the Middle East, which intensified after U.S. airstrikes on Iranian targets . As a result, gold is on track for record inflows, with projections nearing $80 billion this year . Bitcoin, meanwhile, has mostly held above the $100,000 level but briefly dipped below that key support amid geopolitical jitters. Analysts warn that sustained losses below this threshold could trigger a deeper correction, potentially sending the asset toward $80,000 .

2025-06-23T08:18:07,"Adam Back, One of Satoshi Nakamoto Candidates, Speaks About Michael Saylor","Blockstream CEO Adam Back, who is alleged to be Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto, argued that the premium paid for MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock was not exaggerated. Speaking with Bitcoin Podcast host Stephan Livera at the BTC Prague conference, Back noted that the firm has rapidly doubled the amount of Bitcoin per share, reducing risk for investors. “In the case of MicroStrategy, we see that duration being 16 to 18 months. The stock has traded at twice its net asset value (NAV) at times. In that context, the premium seems reasonable,” Back said. According to Back, the premium in the stock prices of companies holding Bitcoin treasury is not theoretical, but a natural result shaped by market conditions. He pointed out that companies' issuance of new shares at this premium and the purchase of Bitcoin increases the amount of BTC per share. “These companies buy more Bitcoin thanks to the premium, thus increasing the amount of Bitcoin falling to shareholders,” he said. Describing MicroStrategy’s strategy as “an arbitrage between the fiat world and the future of Bitcoin,” Back stated that this method does not put investors at risk in the long run because the company compensates for this premium with Bitcoin. Related News: Watch Out: In the Middle of a Busy Week, There Are Lots of Economic Developments and Altcoin Events Coming Up - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List However, Back noted that smaller companies trading at a higher premium pose a greater risk of volatility. Giving the example of MetaPlanet, Back said the company’s NAV multiple fluctuates between 5 and 10, which can stress investors. However, he emphasized that such companies can be more agile in accumulating Bitcoin due to their smaller size. He added that being located in regulatory advantageous regions such as Japan can also facilitate this process. Back, who also opposed Bitcoin's “diminishing returns” theory in his speech, drew attention to the anomalies experienced in previous cycles. Arguing that factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, China's mining ban and money supply expansion overshadowed the 2020-2021 cycle, Back said that historical data could be misleading for this reason. Stating that there could be an “S-curve”-like acceleration in Bitcoin adoption, Back suggested that this cycle could trigger widespread adoption, unlike in the past, and break previous patterns. Back, who also spoke about Blockstream’s new initiatives in the last part of the conference, explained that with the company’s new application, users will be able to buy Bitcoin directly to their own wallets. He also stated that they are trying to make self-storage more accessible with Jade and Jade Plus hardware wallets. “Self-custody is critical to the decentralization of the Bitcoin network. People holding their own keys is crucial to the security and control of the network,” Back said. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-23T08:15:32,"Mysterious whale accumulates ETH after market dip","A newly created wallet turned into an ETH whale after buying the recent dip. The buyer appeared after nearly $80M in long liquidations for ETH. Whale activity remains significant for Ethereum (ETH), as whales are buying the dip. One newly created wallet withdrew 50,256 ETH from the Binance hot wallet, in tranches of 3,000 ETH. The whale started filling up the new wallet in the past 24 hours, after being first funded by a known Binance hot wallet. The whale started buying during one of the periods of rapidly sliding prices for ETH, when the asset wiped out more than 12% of its price. Its average entry was at $2,265 per ETH, starting from the beginning of the price slide. The whale activity suggests a rebound may be on the way, with predictions of a 25% price rally. The whale held only ETH valued at $112.8M, with a minimal amount of WETH. Buying ETH often precedes various forms of staking or usage as collateral to tap the current value and unlock liquidity. Large-scale ETH owners are cautious about taking profits, instead increasing their position and moving liquidity into DeFi. | Source: CryptoQuant Whales have also switched from panic-selling and liquidation to ongoing slow accumulation with the expectation of long-term ETH growth. Overall, whales have switched to accumulation since the end of 2024, with relatively small profit-taking in the past weeks. ETH shows signs of local lows The buying activity sets up expectations that ETH may be done with its downward correction, after nearly $80M in long liquidations in the past 24 hours. ETH open interest fell over the weekend following market volatility and liquidatoins, sliding to $14B from a recent level of $16B. Long positions are still over 75% of open interest, suggesting more liquidations could be instore. ETH traded at $2,239.78, sliding under its recent range. However, even ETH price crashes have led to additional buying from whales, with the goal of achieving a lower average price. ETH also rebounded from its lows against Bitcoin, once again returning to 0.022 BTC. Ethereum holders flock to big DeFi protocols Ethereum is becoming the playground of whales, with liquidity flowing to the top protocols. Based on DeFiLlama data, the Ethereum chain now locks around $57B in total value, with $125.67M in stablecoins. However, DeFi protocols are dominated by the three big sources of ETH passive income. LidoDAO holds over $20B, while Aave returned above $19B TVL. EigenLayer holds over $10B in ETH. The other DeFi protocols holding over $5B in value include Ethena, Ether.Fi and Spark. Lending remains near its peak, leading to whale accumulation and deposits into major protocols. ETH accumulation also follows the recent Pectra upgrade , as whales prepared for running the new larger nodes requiring 2,048 ETH. At the current price range, DeFi remains relatively safe from liquidations. Whales have rebuild lending positions with a high accumulation of liquidable loans at around $1,600, and another significant accumulation just above $1,000. For ETH, the current price action suggests more dips are possible, with most of the liquidable long positions at around $2,100. Liquidating short positions could bring ETH back above $2,300. For now, the overwhelming attitude for ETH is bearish, though still allowing for the occasional whale accumulation.

2025-06-23T08:10:10,"Texas Enacts Law to Integrate Bitcoin Reserves into State Financial Policy","Texas has officially established a legal framework for holding Bitcoin as part of its financial reserves, following the signing of Senate Bill 21 (SB 21) by Governor Greg Abbott on June 21, 2025. Legal Structure for Bitcoin Reserve Approved The new law empowers the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts to manage a dedicated Bitcoin reserve fund, which will be maintained outside the state treasury. Legislative appropriations, dedicated fees, investment income, and voluntary donations of cryptocurrency will support the fund. It introduces formal guidelines for the acquisition, custody, and liquidation of digital assets under state supervision. A key provision in SB 21 limits investments to digital assets with a minimum average market capitalization of $500 billion over the preceding 12 months, a criterion currently met only by Bitcoin. This restriction is designed to mitigate exposure to volatile or thinly traded tokens, effectively making Bitcoin the sole eligible asset for the reserve. Additional Measures to Protect State Crypto Holdings SB 21 follows the earlier passage of House Bill 4488, a complementary measure enacted to protect the state's Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency reserves from being absorbed into Texas’s general revenue fund. Without this legal safeguard, funds allocated for digital asset holdings faced the risk of being liquidated in 2025 to cover budgetary shortfalls. Together, the two pieces of legislation form a comprehensive framework: HB 4488 secures the legal status of Bitcoin reserves under state law, while SB 21 provides the operational authority to purchase and manage those assets. Policy Adjustments and Oversight Provisions During its progression through the legislature, SB 21 underwent several revisions. Notably, the House Committee on Delivery of Government Efficiency introduced clearer operational protocols, risk management guidelines, and limits on speculative investments using public funds. These amendments were aimed at addressing concerns over Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility and the fiscal prudence of allocating government resources to such assets. Broader Implications and Industry Response The decision to formalize Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset marks a notable development in state-level digital asset policy. Supporters argue that this move could enhance Texas’s financial resilience, act as a hedge against inflation, and position the state as a leader in digital asset integration within public finance. However, critics have flagged the initiative’s exposure to risks, including market volatility, regulatory shifts, and cybersecurity threats. Questions remain about whether allocating taxpayer resources to inherently speculative assets aligns with sound fiscal governance.

He’s currently waiting for gold and Bitcoin (BTC) to drop further before he can add more positions, but why the sudden shift to silver? The investor, who predicted the financial crash in 2008, believes that this is a prime time for accumulating silver. Part of his reasoning stems from the fact that gold and Bitcoin are near their all-time high levels, as of the moment of writing. He’s boldly stated that silver is currently a “ bargain” at these prices, and his predictions are that it could 2X, or even 3X this year. He has steadily been warning his followers of the next financial crash, which he thinks will be throughout the summer. FYI: Silver is the best investment today….june 2025.

According to her caption, the payment was successfully executed with XRP, underscoring ongoing efforts to promote real-world use cases for the digital asset within Japan’s growing XRP community. XRP Payment in Action at Community Gathering The video depicted a casual but purposeful demonstration of XRP being used to settle a transaction for food and drinks. This simple but important moment was showcased as part of a larger effort to normalize digital payments through the XRP Ledger. The setting—a relaxed after-party following XRPL Japan Community Day—allowed attendees and followers to witness the practicality of XRP in informal, day-to-day scenarios.

Some users drew comparisons to early Bitcoin milestones. One such reaction came from Michael Gigliotti, who suggested that the moment might be remembered similarly to Bitcoin’s first commercial transaction—paying for pizza in 2010. In a related tone, a commenter named LFC Fan entertained the idea that this could one day be seen as “XRP Taco Day,” alluding to a potential tradition within the XRP community that commemorates its early real-world uses. Not all replies shared this optimistic view. A more critical response came from a user identified as Shine195, who expressed frustration with XRP’s lack of price movement and perceived it as underwhelming in comparison to Bitcoin. They criticized the continued positioning of XRP alongside BTC, asserting that XRP lags significantly in value and market performance. Such comments reflect a long-standing split within the community between those who focus on utility and those who prioritize asset appreciation. Local Utility as a Driver for Broader Adoption Mai’s video and the broader XRPL Japan Community Day serve as part of a larger strategy to advance the perception of XRP as more than just a speculative asset. By making it visible in ordinary, real-world contexts—such as buying tacos and drinks—advocates aim to underscore its transaction efficiency and simplicity. These grassroots applications help the public engage with the token outside the abstract discussions on blockchain or trading platforms. As more community events adopt similar practices, such demonstrations may serve as blueprints for broader adoption in retail and social settings.
