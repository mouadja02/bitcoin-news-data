XRP is currently trading at $2, down 2.2%, but holding up better than many altcoins. Many analysts believe that its real-world utility, strong community, and growing institutional interest are helping it stay resilient through global uncertainty. XRP Holders Are ‚ÄúCosmic Royalty‚Äù Monerex CEO Mark Otto recently delivered a powerful message to the XRP community, highlighting the unique vision shared by its holders. ‚ÄúYou hold a special cosmic royalty. You see what‚Äôs coming and stand to benefit, and help your family for generations to come,‚Äù Otto said, speaking directly to XRP supporters. ""You hold a special cosmic royalty. You see what's coming and stand to benefit, and really help your family for generations to come."" Our CEO, Mark Otto, speaks directly to XRP holders. pic.twitter.com/NCJ7arcbXS ‚Äî Monerex (@MonerexOfficial) June 21, 2025 ‚ÄúWe hold a certain frequency to not only understand crypto and technology, but to have an intuition of knowing what is to come,‚Äù he said. These remarks reflect a growing sentiment among XRP holders that they are part of something much larger than just a financial movement and are early participants in a global shift. Wall Street Is Missing XRP‚Äôs Potential At the Las Vegas 2025 event, Teucrium CEO Sal Gilbertie had also shared similar remarks. He said that Wall Street is overlooking the true power of the XRP community. Ripple is playing a major role in shaping the future of crypto, and its impact is being underestimated. He had also called XRP ‚Äúthe crypto with the most utility.‚Äù Although XRP dropped over 7% in the past week, the investor interest remains strong. In a recent interview, the Teucrium CEO had noted rising demand for XRP-based investment products, adding that many believe XRP could deliver bigger long-term gains than Bitcoin. While he noted the risks of leveraged products, he believes XRP‚Äôs role in tokenization and finance could drive long-term growth, making it an asset worth watching. Analyst Edo Farina has also argued that XRP has a better risk-reward ratio than Bitcoin, thanks to its lower price and real-world use. XRP Outperforms Entire Market Notably, XRP is up over 300% in a year, while most digital assets are still struggling. While Bitcoin hovers near all-time highs, many altcoins remain stuck below bear market levels. XRP, meanwhile, has outperformed the entire market. Let‚Äôs not forget: $XRP is up over 300% in a year that‚Äôs been brutal for most digital assets.

Speaking at APEX 2025, he emphasized that the real competition isn‚Äôt in messaging, it is in liquidity. With rising institutional demand, strong community backing, and growing odds of an ETF approval (now estimated at 95%), XRP holders may already be front-running the future.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-holders-are-cosmic-royalty-leading-a-global-financial-shift/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

Analysts predict a gradual price increase, with potential highs reaching $175 by 2030. Bitcoin SV price (BSV) has been on muted growth trajectory compared to other altcoins. Since the beginning of the year, signaling prolonged bearish sentiment, Bitcoin SV (BSV) has consistently traded below its 200-day EMA band. Despite attempts to gain traction, the asset has failed to show any long-term bullish reversal, raising doubts among investors and traders about its recovery potential. Even it‚Äôs a non-profit organization, BSV association, optimistic activities like successful collaboration and hackathon events are not manifesting on the BSV price chartMany ask: ‚ÄúCan BSV Price break bearish trend above 200-day EMA?, ‚ÄúIs BSV a hidden gem waiting for its breakout, or just another risky bet?‚Äù. In this Bitcoin SV price prediction 2025 article, we‚Äôll explore the future for BSV Price from 2025 through 2030. Table of Contents Overview Coinpedia‚Äôs Bitcoin SV Price Forecast 2025 BSV Price Prediction 2025 Bitcoin SV Price Forecast 2026-2030 BSV Coin Price Prediction 2026 Bitcoin SV Price Forecast 2027 Bitcoin SV (BSV) Price Prediction 2028 BSV Crypto Price Prediction 2029 Bitcoin SV (BSV) Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin SV Token BSV Price $¬†29.22669823 -1.14% Market cap $¬†581,106,677.5559 Circulating Supply 19,882,734.3750 Trading Volume $¬†49,434,133.5539 All-time high $491.64 on 16th April 2021 All-time low $23.30 on 10th June 2024 Coinpedia‚Äôs Bitcoin SV Price Forecast 2025 Based on the historical data, price analysis, and broader market sentiments, the BSV price is expected to surge by the end of 2025. With an average of $86 , the BSV token price can hit a high of $117 and a low of $55. Year Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2025 55 86 117 BSV Price Prediction 2025 In 2024‚Äôs second half, an ascending broadening wedge pattern was developed by BSV‚Äôs price action. This was followed by a strong buying movement witnessed in Q4 2024, which began from the wedge‚Äôs lower border to its upper border. Many experts viewed that continuation of bullish momentum could lead to new levels higher, but the upper border closely aligned with a strong resistance zone, and that repelled its price trajectory downwards to 2025‚Äôs first half, eroding over 60% of its gains. Despite BSV price‚Äôs effort to rise higher in Q2 of 2025, the bullish strength fell short to push prices higher, as a result, BSV ended up in another declining wedge. Many had anticipated that BSV would reach the round number of $50, but it failed to meet that target by the end of April, dampening investor morale. The last seen good momentum was in Q4 2024 and which is now sorely missed by BSV investors. In April, BSV reached as high as $47 but faced rejection at the resistance block and proceeded to form lower lows. The recent bearish crossover between the 20-day EMA and the 50-day EMA signals increasing bearish pressure in the short term. Despite several optimistic factors in Q2 2025, price action stayed muted due to worsened conflict between Iran and Israel, and the recent action of the US has worsened the financial sector further. If BSV continues to decline within a downward wedge, then BSV‚Äôs price could drop further toward the $24 level. However, there‚Äôs a key turning point‚Äîif BSV manages to break out of this falling wedge pattern and flip the 200-day EMA band or break above the $40 price level, the trend could shift bullish. A decisive move above the 200-day EMA band might give BSV the momentum it needs to retest the $50 mark by the end of June. Furthermore, if this breakout is supported by increased adoption and BSV successfully clears the $50 resistance, the crypto could gain the momentum required to target $65 by the end of 2025.

Key Takeaways: Crypto funds saw $1.24B in weekly inflows, extending the streak to 10 weeks and $15.1B year-to-date. U.S. led inflows with $1.25B, while Hong Kong and Switzerland posted notable outflows. Bitcoin and Ethereum dominated flows, with altcoins like Solana and XRP also attracting fresh capital. Despite the milestone, the pace of inflows slowed in the latter half of the week, according to a Monday report by CoinShares . The report attributed the decline to the U.S. Juneteenth holiday and rising geopolitical uncertainty surrounding reports of U.S. involvement in the Iran conflict . The US Attracts $1.25 Billion in Crypto Funds Inflows The US remained the primary driver, contributing $1.25 billion in inflows. Canada and Germany added $20.9 million and $10.9 million, respectively. However, Hong Kong and Switzerland posted outflows of $32.6 million and $7.7 million, partially offsetting the global momentum. Bitcoin attracted $1.1 billion in fresh capital, marking its second straight week of inflows despite recent price weakness, signaling continued appetite among institutional buyers. Short-Bitcoin products, meanwhile, saw modest outflows of $1.4 million, reinforcing the bullish bias.

Solana and XRP also drew attention, with inflows of $2.78 million and $2.69 million respectively, underscoring broader altcoin interest even as global risk sentiment shifts. BTC Stuck in Range as Analysts Eye Breakout or $91K Correction Bitcoin has been range-bound since May 9, trading between $100,500 and $110,800, according to analysts at B2BinPay. The asset is currently hovering near the midpoint of that range, leaving traders uncertain about the next major move. In a note shared with Cryptonews.com, the analysts said that key liquidity levels, including the January 20 high, were cleared out during the May 21 price action. This opens the door for a potential correction toward $91,300, retracing the rally that began on April 7. ‚ÄúA proper correction to that level would not be unreasonable,‚Äù the firm stated. However, there‚Äôs also a case for a bullish breakout. B2BinPay highlights the current state of altcoins, many of which have already swept their key lows and are now trading near historically weak levels compared to BTC. This exhaustion in altcoin selling could signal a rotation back into Bitcoin, pushing it higher. Bitcoin dominance remains elevated at nearly 65%. A significant pullback to $91K would likely trigger a steep selloff across altcoins unless dominance retreats in parallel. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why any expectation of a deeper Bitcoin pullback should be tied to a significant drop in dominance. Until that happens, the broader market is likely to remain under pressure,‚Äù they concluded.

But their vision extends beyond just accumulating Bitcoin; they also aim to acquire 5,000 housing units within the same timeframe, suggesting a strategic link between their digital asset holdings and their physical real estate portfolio. The decision to add Bitcoin Balance Sheet assets is a bold one for a real estate firm. Traditionally, real estate investment firms focus on physical properties, debt, and equity within the real estate sector. Introducing a volatile, decentralized digital asset like Bitcoin represents a significant departure and reflects a growing trend of institutional players exploring cryptocurrencies as part of a diversified treasury strategy. Why Would a Real Estate Giant Buy Bitcoin? The integration of Bitcoin into a Real Estate Bitcoin strategy might seem counterintuitive at first glance. However, several factors likely influenced Cardone Capital‚Äôs decision: Inflation Hedge: With concerns about inflation and the devaluation of fiat currencies, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a potential store of value and a hedge against purchasing power erosion. Real estate is also seen as an inflation hedge, but Bitcoin offers a different type of uncorrelated asset. Store of Value: Proponents argue Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed supply and decentralized nature make it a superior long-term store of value compared to traditional assets prone to inflationary pressures or central bank policies. Potential Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term growth potential, offering the possibility of substantial returns that could complement or even fuel real estate acquisitions. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin provides diversification away from purely real estate-dependent assets, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk (though introducing crypto-specific risks). Innovation and Marketing: Embracing Bitcoin positions Cardone Capital as forward-thinking and innovative, potentially attracting a new segment of investors interested in exposure to both real estate and digital assets. The Fund Supporting the Bitcoin Push To facilitate its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition goals, Cardone Capital announced in April the launch of a new fund. This fund is specifically backed by 10 real estate assets. The purpose of this fund is to generate capital that will be used to support the firm‚Äôs planned BTC purchases. This structure is particularly interesting as it links traditional, income-generating real estate assets directly to the acquisition of digital assets, creating a bridge between the two worlds. This innovative funding mechanism demonstrates how established industries are finding creative ways to enter the crypto space, using their existing assets and expertise to back their digital ambitions. It provides a clear example of how Institutional Bitcoin Adoption is evolving beyond simple direct purchases to more complex financial structures. Grant Cardone Bitcoin Vision: What Does it Mean? Grant Cardone Bitcoin advocacy is not entirely new, but this move signifies a full institutional commitment. Cardone is known for his strong opinions on investment and wealth building, often promoting strategies outside the conventional norm. Integrating Bitcoin into his real estate empire sends a powerful message to both the real estate and crypto communities. His vision appears to be one where digital scarcity (Bitcoin) and physical assets (real estate) can coexist and mutually benefit each other. The plan to acquire both 3,000 more BTC and 5,000 housing units simultaneously suggests a strategy where gains from one asset class might be used to acquire the other, or perhaps where holding BTC provides a strategic financial buffer or opportunity fund for large-scale real estate deals. Challenges and Considerations for a Bitcoin Balance Sheet While the move is bold and potentially rewarding, adding a significant amount of Bitcoin to a corporate Bitcoin Balance Sheet comes with inherent challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin‚Äôs price is known for its significant fluctuations, which could impact the reported value of the firm‚Äôs holdings and potentially create accounting complexities. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, which could introduce unforeseen challenges or compliance requirements. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of digital assets requires robust security measures to protect against hacks or theft. Public Perception: Some traditional investors may view this move with skepticism, given Bitcoin‚Äôs relative novelty compared to real estate. Cardone Capital will need to navigate these challenges carefully as they execute their strategy. Is This the Future of Real Estate Investment? Cardone Capital‚Äôs pioneering step raises questions about the future intersection of Real Estate Bitcoin strategies and broader institutional adoption. Will other real estate firms follow suit? The success or challenges faced by Cardone Capital could serve as a case study for the industry. This move is a clear signal of the increasing maturity and acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, even within sectors as traditional as real estate. It highlights a growing willingness among certain institutional players to look beyond conventional boundaries in pursuit of innovative investment and treasury management strategies. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors watching this trend, several insights emerge: Diversification is Key: This move underscores the growing importance of considering non-traditional assets like Bitcoin for portfolio diversification. Institutional Interest is Growing: Cardone Capital‚Äôs action is another data point confirming the trend of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption . This can influence market dynamics. Understand the ‚ÄòWhy‚Äô: Analyze the rationale behind institutional moves into crypto ‚Äì often it‚Äôs about long-term strategy, inflation hedging, or growth potential. Research Hybrid Models: Keep an eye on innovative models like Cardone Capital‚Äôs fund, which blend traditional assets with crypto. Concluding Thoughts: A Bold Bet on a Digital Future Cardone Capital‚Äôs decision to add 1,000 BTC to its balance sheet and plan for significantly more is a bold and potentially transformative move. It positions the firm at the forefront of integrating digital assets into the traditionally conservative real estate sector. By linking real estate assets to Bitcoin acquisition via a dedicated fund, they are creating a unique hybrid model. While challenges remain, this step by a prominent firm like Cardone Capital under the leadership of Grant Cardone Bitcoin vision is a significant indicator of the increasing overlap between the worlds of traditional finance, real estate, and cryptocurrencies. It‚Äôs a development worth watching closely as it could pave the way for broader adoption and innovative strategies in the future.

2025-06-23T10:49:25,"‚ÄòRich Dad Poor Dad‚Äô Author Robert Kiyosaki Predicts ‚ÄòBiggest Debt Bubble‚Äô Collapse, Says Buy Bitcoin to Get Richer","Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has issued his most dire warning about an impending ‚Äú global monetary collapse ,‚Äù urging followers to accumulate Bitcoin , gold, and silver as protection against the ‚Äú biggest debt bubble in history. ‚Äù GLOBAL MONETARY COLLAPSE COMING? Will you be richer or poorer when biggest debt bubble in history bursts. I recommend owning gold, silver, and BITCOIN if you want to be richer when the Global Debt Bubble bursts. BIGGEST LOSERS will be savers of fake fiat money and especially‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 23, 2025 In an X post, the bestselling financial educator declared that the coming collapse will create winners and losers on a large scale, with ‚Äúbiggest losers‚Äù being ‚Äúsavers of fake fiat money and especially bonds,‚Äù while those holding hard assets will emerge richer. Kiyosaki‚Äôs alarm comes as the U.S. national debt has exploded to $37 trillion, creating what economists describe as an unsustainable fiscal trajectory that threatens America‚Äôs global economic dominance. Federal Debt: Total Public Debt Source: Fred.stlouisfed.org Leading economists, including Ray Dalio, Ken Rogoff, and Niall Ferguson, have all expressed grave concerns about an impending debt crisis. Ferguson‚Äôs research shows that America now spends more on debt service ( $1.1 trillion ) than on defense ( $883.7 billion ), a historical pattern that has preceded the decline of every major global power. Source: fiscaldata.treasury.gov This fiscal deterioration occurs as the debt-to-GDP ratio has reached 123%, a level that economists warn could trigger a ‚Äú debt-induced economic heart attack ‚Äù if corrective measures aren‚Äôt implemented rapidly. America‚Äôs Debt Death Spiral: When Interest Exceeds Defense Spending The mathematics of America‚Äôs debt crisis paints a sobering picture that validates Kiyosaki‚Äôs apocalyptic warnings about monetary collapse. The national debt has quadrupled from $10 trillion in 2000 to over $37 trillion today, while showing no signs of sustainable resolution. The most alarming development is the exponential growth trajectory that has pushed debt service costs above defense spending for the first time in modern history, triggering what economist Niall Ferguson calls ‚ÄúFerguson‚Äôs Law.‚Äù This principle states that any great power spending more on debt service than defense risks losing its global dominance . This fiscal deterioration accelerated dramatically during recent administrations, with debt growing 39% under Trump‚Äôs previous term alone. The structural impossibility of growing out of this debt burden becomes clear when examining the mathematics of compound interest versus realistic GDP growth projections. We can both grow the economy and control the debt. What is important is that the economy grows faster than the debt. If we change the growth trajectory of the country, of the economy, then we will stabilize our finances and grow our way out of this. pic.twitter.com/lv07wJne1f ‚Äî Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent (@SecScottBessent) May 23, 2025 Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent‚Äôs optimistic theory that ‚Äúwe can grow our way out of debt‚Äù requires sustained economic expansion not seen since the post-World War II boom, yet the World Bank projects U.S. growth declining from 2.8% in 2024 to just 1.4% in 2025. Meanwhile, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to reach 140% by 2029, creating what economists describe as a ‚Äú death spiral ‚Äù where increasing debt service crowds out productive government spending on infrastructure, education, and defense. The consequences extend far beyond abstract fiscal metrics to real-world impacts on American living standards and global competitiveness. Since COVID-related money printing began, the dollar has lost over 20% of its purchasing power, with food prices up 23% and transportation costs rising 34%. This represents permanent structural inflation that erodes savings and wages. Interest payments now consume 13% of the federal budget. They are projected to reach $1 trillion annually by 2033, forcing inevitable cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid programs that collectively represent nearly $3.2 trillion in annual spending. This fiscal compression occurs as America faces mounting geopolitical challenges that require increased defense spending, creating an impossible choice between military readiness and fiscal sustainability . Bitcoin as the Ultimate Hedge Against Monetary Debasement Kiyosaki‚Äôs recommendation to accumulate Bitcoin is more than speculative investment advice; it is rooted in a fundamental understanding of how monetary crises unfold and why scarce assets historically outperform during periods of currency debasement. Bitcoin‚Äôs mathematically enforced supply cap of 21 million coins contrasts starkly with the unlimited money printing that characterizes modern fiat systems, and has reduced its inflation rate over time. It offers what Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong describes as a ‚Äúcheck and balance‚Äù on government deficit spending that could eventually position Bitcoin as the world‚Äôs reserve currency if fiscal irresponsibility continues unchecked. The historical precedent for this monetary transition is compelling, with every major currency collapse throughout history being preceded by unsustainable debt accumulation and attempts to inflate away obligations through money printing. Venezuela‚Äôs debt-to-GDP ratio exploded from a manageable 30% in 1998 to over 300% by 2020, resulting in hyperinflation that made the national currency worthless and forced millions to flee the country. While America‚Äôs reserve currency status temporarily protects it from such a dramatic collapse, the underlying dynamics remain identical. The currency is facing exponential debt growth , declining confidence , and increasing adoption of alternative stores of value . Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a monetary hedge becomes particularly relevant when considering the limited alternatives available to ordinary citizens seeking protection from currency debasement. Traditional hedges like gold and real estate face regulatory constraints, storage challenges, and potential confiscation risks, while Bitcoin‚Äôs decentralized nature and global accessibility make it virtually impossible for governments to restrict or seize. The cryptocurrency‚Äôs performance during recent inflationary periods demonstrates this protective function, with Bitcoin reaching all-time highs as investors seek refuge from deficit spending and monetary expansion. The institutional adoption wave further validates Bitcoin‚Äôs monetary hedge thesis, with MicroStrategy accumulating over 592,000 BTC as a treasury asset and numerous public companies following similar strategies. In fact, VanEck‚Äôs recent analysis suggests that a strategic Bitcoin reserve could offset 18% of U.S. debt by 2049 if the cryptocurrency continues appreciating at historical rates. This would provide a mathematical pathway for nations to escape debt traps through early Bitcoin adoption.

On Sunday, Saylor posted a chart of Strategy‚Äôs past Bitcoin buys to X, captioned, ‚ÄúNothing Stops This Orange.‚Äù The cryptic message mirrors past posts that preceded new Bitcoin purchases by the firm.

That figure represents nearly 2.8% of the total supply. Strategy Faces Class Action Over Unrealized Bitcoin Loss, Insider Sales Allegations The post comes amid rising scrutiny. On Thursday, Saylor and other Strategy executives were sued in a Virginia federal court. The lawsuit, filed by shareholder Abhey Parmar, accused Saylor, CEO Phong Le, CFO Andrew Kang, and four board members of breaching their fiduciary duties and misleading investors ahead of the company‚Äôs Q1 earnings report. The lawsuit centers on Strategy‚Äôs adoption of a new Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rule in January . The rule allowed companies to mark crypto holdings to their fair market value on balance sheets. According to the suit, the change caused Strategy to report a $5.9 billion unrealized loss on its Bitcoin holdings, disclosed in early April. That news triggered an almost 9% drop in the company‚Äôs stock price . Parmar claims the company‚Äôs leadership failed to fully disclose how the accounting change could affect its financials. He also argues they downplayed the risks of Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility. ‚ÄúThe company‚Äôs profitability when applying its bitcoin-driven investment strategy and treasury options were substantially less profitable than represented,‚Äù the filing stated. In addition, the lawsuit accuses executives of offloading company stock while its price was still inflated. Parmar alleges they sold shares for personal gain before the loss became public, collecting a combined $31.5 million. He further accuses the group of corporate waste, gross mismanagement, and abusing their control. Saylor has not commented publicly on the lawsuit, but he continues to express confidence in Bitcoin.

2025-06-23T10:40:39,"Crypto Fear and Greed Index: Shifting to Neutral Sparks Hope","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear and Greed Index: Shifting to Neutral Sparks Hope The digital asset landscape is constantly evolving, and understanding the collective mood of investors is crucial. A key indicator many traders and enthusiasts watch is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index . Recently, this widely followed metric has shown a notable shift, climbing to 47 and moving out of the ‚ÄòFear‚Äô territory and into the ‚ÄòNeutral‚Äô zone. This change in crypto market sentiment suggests a potential easing of extreme pessimism that had previously gripped the market. Understanding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index Before diving into the implications of the current reading, let‚Äôs quickly recap what the Fear and Greed Index is and how it works. Developed by Alternative.me, the index aims to quantify the dominant emotion driving the cryptocurrency market at any given time. Think of it as a barometer for crypto sentiment . The index operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear ‚Äì Indicates investors are very worried, often leading to panic selling. Historically, this can sometimes present buying opportunities for brave investors. 25-49: Fear ‚Äì While not extreme, fear still dominates the market, leading to caution and potential selling pressure. 50-50: Neutral ‚Äì The market sentiment is balanced. There‚Äôs no strong leaning towards fear or greed. This can indicate uncertainty or a period of consolidation. 51-74: Greed ‚Äì Investors are becoming optimistic or even bullish. This can lead to increased buying activity. 75-100: Extreme Greed ‚Äì The market is experiencing FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Prices may be unsustainably high, and a correction could be imminent. The recent move to 47 places the index squarely in the ‚ÄòNeutral‚Äô zone, suggesting that the intense ‚ÄòFear‚Äô observed previously has subsided somewhat. What Factors Influence the Fear and Greed Index? The index isn‚Äôt based on a single data point but aggregates information from six different sources. Understanding these factors provides deeper insight into the overall Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index calculation (as Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance plays a role) and the broader crypto market sentiment . Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the components: Factor Weighting How it‚Äôs Measured Volatility 25% Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to average values. Higher volatility indicates fear. Market Momentum / Volume 25% Analyzes the current volume and market momentum compared to average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume in a positive market suggests greed. Social Media 15% Scans Twitter for posts related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It analyzes the sentiment of these posts and the speed at which they are generated. High interaction rates can indicate greedy behavior. Surveys 15% Polls users to gauge their sentiment. (Note: This factor is currently paused, meaning the other factors carry slightly more weight in the calculation). Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin‚Äôs share of the total cryptocurrency market cap. An increasing dominance often indicates investors are moving from altcoins back into Bitcoin, which can be seen as a sign of fear regarding riskier assets. Decreasing dominance can signal increasing greed for altcoins. Google Trends 10% Analyzes Google search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. For example, a surge in searches for terms like ‚ÄòBitcoin price manipulation‚Äô can indicate fear. The fact that surveys are paused is a minor point, but it means the other five factors are currently determining the index value. What Does the Shift to ‚ÄòNeutral‚Äô Signify? The rise from 42 to 47 and the subsequent move into the ‚ÄòNeutral‚Äô zone is a positive development for crypto sentiment . It suggests that the intense fear that might have led investors to panic sell or avoid the market is dissipating. A neutral reading indicates a more balanced market state where neither extreme fear nor extreme greed is dominant. This doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean a bull run is imminent, but it often signifies a stabilization period. Investors might be feeling less panicked and are perhaps taking a more measured approach. It could reflect a period where prices have found a temporary floor, or recent news has instilled a degree of cautious optimism. Navigating the Neutral Zone: Opportunities and Considerations For investors, the ‚ÄòNeutral‚Äô reading on the Fear and Greed Index presents a different environment compared to the extremes. Benefits of a Neutral Market Sentiment: Reduced Emotional Trading: When sentiment is neutral, there‚Äôs less pressure from widespread panic selling or FOMO buying, potentially leading to more rational investment decisions. Opportunity for Analysis: A neutral market can be a good time to research projects, evaluate fundamentals, and plan strategies without the urgency imposed by extreme market swings. Potential for Consolidation: Often, a neutral index reading coincides with periods of price consolidation, where assets trade sideways, allowing for potential accumulation at stable levels. Challenges in the Neutral Zone: Uncertainty: Neutral doesn‚Äôt mean predictable. The market could still swing back to fear or accelerate towards greed depending on external factors. Lack of Clear Direction: Unlike extreme readings which can sometimes hint at potential reversals (though not guaranteed), a neutral reading offers less guidance on the immediate future price direction. Actionable Insights: Maintain Caution: While fear has receded, the market isn‚Äôt in a state of extreme optimism either. Avoid making impulsive decisions. Focus on Research: Use this period to deepen your understanding of specific cryptocurrencies and the broader market trends. Develop a Strategy: If you haven‚Äôt already, define your investment goals, risk tolerance, and entry/exit strategies. A neutral market is a good time for planning. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Continuing a DCA strategy can be effective in a neutral market, allowing you to accumulate assets regardless of short-term fluctuations. Historical Context and the Fear and Greed Index Looking back at the history of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index , periods of extreme fear have often coincided with market bottoms, while periods of extreme greed have aligned with market tops. However, it‚Äôs crucial to remember that the index is a sentiment tool, not a crystal ball or a direct trading signal. Relying solely on the index for investment decisions is risky. It‚Äôs one data point among many that savvy investors consider. Combining the insights from the index with technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and broader economic indicators provides a more comprehensive view of the market. Conclusion: A Step Towards Stability? The recent shift in the Crypto Fear and Greed Index from ‚ÄòFear‚Äô to ‚ÄòNeutral‚Äô is a positive sign for crypto market sentiment . It suggests that the intense pessimism is easing, potentially paving the way for a more stable period. While a neutral reading doesn‚Äôt guarantee an upward trend, it removes the immediate pressure often associated with extreme fear or greed. For investors, this period calls for balanced judgment rather than emotional reactions. It‚Äôs an opportune time to focus on strategy, research, and cautious participation. The index reminds us that while sentiment is a powerful force in crypto, a well-informed and disciplined approach remains the best path forward.

The development spells a continuation of the Israel-Iran conflict, and has featured in several crypto social media discussions, according to blockchain intelligence firm Santiment. President Donald Trump confirmed on Saturday night that the US military had targeted and destroyed three Iranian nuclear sites.

The Israel-Iran keyword is at an all-time high social dominance, correlating directly with the timing of US strikes on Iran‚Äôs nuclear infrastructure. Santiment‚Äôs data shows that social mentions of bearish language, such as ‚Äúlower‚Äù and ‚Äúbelow,‚Äù went up at the time of the airstrikes. The chatter coincided with Bitcoin‚Äôs price dipping to around $98,200, followed by a strong bounce back above $100,000. A previous drop to $98,000 had started short-term bearish sentiment. However, according to CryptoQuant, no major red flags were visible in on-chain indicators. Bitcoin has since stabilized, fluctuating between $100,000 and $102,000. Market participants may be viewing the geopolitical shock as temporary or already priced in. Consolidation, not capitulation According to market analyst Michael van de Poppe, Bitcoin‚Äôs price drop was a classic liquidity sweep. In his analysis , Bitcoin fell beneath a low at $100,500, found liquidity, and corrected back up $101,000. He predicted that if the $102,500 mark is broken, the upward move would accelerate and end the short-term correction. On-chain data from CryptoQuant shows Binary Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) 30-day moving average, often used to gauge long-term holder activity, peaked at 0.6 before beginning to decline, below the 0.8 threshold associated with overheated markets. One contributor on the platform explained that the largest coin by market cap is in a phase of consolidation rather than capitulation. Long-term investors are still holding onto their positions. Still, Polymarket predictions see a 42% probability to BTC dipping below $95,000 this month, Santiment‚Äôs social chart data also illustrates the inverse relationship between crowd sentiment and price movements. A spike in ‚ÄúFUD‚Äù (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) talk was recorded when BTC hovered around $98,200. Shortly afterward, the price moved opposite to retail trader expectations. ‚Äú Everything before the next all-time high is a dip ,‚Äù remarked Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao on X. The second-ranking crypto by market cap has struggled getting back to its 12 month high of $4,007, down more than 45% since the December bull run. At the time of this publication, Ether is changing hands at around $2,200 after failing several times to move past the $2,300 mark during Monday‚Äôs early Asian trading hours.

2025-06-23T10:30:49,"Bitcoin Down But Not Out‚ÄîAnalyst Sees Recovery Ahead Amid Middle East War","Bitcoin briefly slid to $98,974 late on Sunday after US airstrikes targeted Iranian nuclear facilities. That was its weakest point since early May. But by Monday morning in Asia, the leading cryptocurrency topped $101,000 again. Traders are weighing whether this was just a hiccup or the start of a fresh trend. Related Reading: Stablecoin Wars Ignite: Peter Schiff Champions Gold-Backed Digital Assets Source: CoinMarketCap Arthur Hayes Sees Temporary Weakness According to Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, the fall is only a short pause. On X, he wrote that ‚Äúweakness shall pass‚Äù and predicted Bitcoin will ‚Äúleave no doubt as to its safe haven status.‚Äù He said fresh money printing by central banks will be the main force driving prices back up. His view suggests that big dips can turn into buying chances when broader liquidity is rising. Do you hear that? ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the sound of the money printers revving up to do their patriotic duty. This weakness shall pass and $BTC will leave no doubt as to its safe haven status. pic.twitter.com/PTfZaAXFp7 ‚Äî Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) June 22, 2025 Market Dips On Geopolitical News Based on reports, it was US strikes on Iran that triggered the initial slide. The price drop happened late Sunday, pushing Bitcoin below six figures for the first time since early May. Yet buyers stepped in quickly, snapping up coins and lifting the price back above $101,000 during the first hours of trading in Asia. That pattern shows how headline shocks can spark fast moves, but also how quickly sentiment can flip. Altcoins Take A Hit Meanwhile, over the past 12 hours, most altcoins fell about 1.4%, dragging total crypto market cap down by roughly $50 billion to $3.20 trillion, according to data. Experts expect that trend to reverse once major headlines calm down. Market analysts pointed out that altcoins might start to outperform if macro risks ease. They said smaller tokens are already showing signs of strength, even as Bitcoin stalls. Key Technical Levels Hold Traders are watching two key lines: the short-term realized price at $98,000 and the trend support at $102,000. The realized price reflects the average breakeven point for holders, so it often acts like a floor.

2025-06-23T10:30:38,"Wall Street Caught Manipulating Bitcoin? Expert Tells The Truth","Allegations that Wall Street is deliberately suppressing Bitcoin‚Äôs price are nothing new‚Äîbut according to James ‚ÄúCheckmate‚Äù Check, they‚Äôre nothing more than fiction. In a wide-ranging appearance on the G‚Äôday Bitcoin podcast, the Check on Chain analyst directly addressed the conspiracy theories circulating across X, asserting that the appearance of price stagnation is entirely natural‚Äîand misunderstood. Is Bitcoin Being Held Down? ‚ÄúThe number one source of price suppression is people‚Äôs boredom,‚Äù Check said early in the interview , responding to a wave of online frustration about Bitcoin‚Äôs apparent refusal to rally despite consistent institutional demand. In his view, the idea that the price is being ‚Äúheld down‚Äù by some external manipulator fails to grasp the basic mechanics of markets: every buyer requires a seller. At the heart of the claim is a contradiction. Users on X point to billion-dollar purchases from entities like Strategy and ask why the price has gone nowhere. Check‚Äôs answer was as simple as it was blunt: ‚ÄúPeople are selling billions of dollars to Saylor.‚Äù That‚Äôs how the price stays flat. The misconception, he argues, stems from a flawed understanding of how markets absorb liquidity. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just really, really simple,‚Äù he repeated. ‚ÄúWhen you hit the buy button, you don‚Äôt want the market to send. Saylor wants to buy and then the market moves, right? That‚Äôs just how markets work. Get over it.‚Äù Far from being evidence of foul play, the sideways action‚Äîwhat he calls ‚Äúchop-solidation‚Äù‚Äîis a normal, healthy process in which markets digest previous gains. He explained the term ‚Äúchop-solidation‚Äù as a fusion of technical consolidation and the Choppiness Index, a volatility oscillator that signals the degree to which a market is trending or ranging. The current period of stasis, hovering above $100,000 for weeks, follows an aggressive multi-month rally from the post-FTX lows. In such conditions, according to Check, a pause is inevitable. ‚ÄúMarkets cannot go up or down in a straight line.‚Äù But why does the idea of manipulation persist? For Check, it‚Äôs psychological. ‚ÄúPeople get so bored,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey start concocting these stories.‚Äù He likened the current mood to earlier phases in the cycle‚Äî$20‚Äì$30K in 2023, or the long sideways movement between $45K and $75K. In both cases, people cried manipulation, only for the market to eventually break higher. The real frustration, he suggests, lies in investors‚Äô emotional volatility, not price volatility. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a stone‚Äôs throw from the all-time high,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt goes down to go up. Like, that‚Äôs so often how this plays out.‚Äù Either the market spikes violently upward, catching traders off guard, or it dips just enough to trigger fear and capitulation ‚Äîbefore snapping back and leaving skeptics behind. ‚ÄúPeople will capitulate and panic and then it will just springboard straight up to new all-time highs.‚Äù Chop-Solidation Is Needed In Check‚Äôs view, the pattern is clear. Consolidation after expansion. Panic after boredom. Breakout after capitulation. There is no need to invent dark motives. ‚ÄúThis is how bottoms get formed.‚Äù And if you‚Äôve been around Bitcoin long enough, he implies, you‚Äôve seen this movie before. His broader message is aimed at calming emotional overreactions. ‚ÄúChop-solidation is part of the process,‚Äù he insisted. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how markets work.‚Äù Far from being orchestrated by institutions to accumulate at low prices, the range-bound nature of Bitcoin is the market‚Äôs way of preparing for the next leg‚Äîwhether up or down. In sum, Check dismantled the manipulation narrative with a data-backed, experience-driven view: the illusion of suppression isn‚Äôt a function of centralized control but of collective impatience. The price isn‚Äôt rigged‚Äîit‚Äôs resting. And when it moves, it won‚Äôt be because of a conspiracy . It‚Äôll be because the market, as it always does, is simply doing its job.

2025-06-23T10:30:37,"Shocking CME Bitcoin Futures Gap: $4,090 Drop Signals Market Volatility","BitcoinWorld Shocking CME Bitcoin Futures Gap: $4,090 Drop Signals Market Volatility Get ready for a deep dive into the fascinating world of financial markets, specifically where traditional finance meets the cutting edge of digital assets. Today, all eyes are on the significant price action observed in the CME Bitcoin futures market. A substantial gap has appeared at the open, and understanding what this means is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto market . What is the Significant CME Bitcoin Futures Gap? TradingView data revealed that Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) kicked off the trading week at $99,640. This figure represents a notable drop of $4,090 compared to the previous close of $103,730 on the four-hour chart. This difference between the closing price of one trading session and the opening price of the next, where there‚Äôs no trading in between, is commonly referred to as a ‚Äògap‚Äô. Here‚Äôs a quick look at the numbers: Previous Close (Four-Hour Chart): $103,730 Opening Price: $99,640 Price Gap: $4,090 lower This specific gap occurred because CME futures, which largely follow traditional market hours (closing on Friday and reopening on Sunday/Monday), were not trading over the weekend. Meanwhile, the underlying Bitcoin market trades 24/7. Any significant price movement in Bitcoin over the weekend can create a gap when the CME futures market reopens. Why Do CME Gaps Matter for the Bitcoin Price and Crypto Market? CME Bitcoin futures are a significant instrument in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, particularly for institutional investors. Their activity and the price levels traded on CME are often watched closely as indicators of broader market sentiment and potential price targets. While the spot Bitcoin price is determined by exchanges trading 24/7, the CME market provides insights into how larger, more traditional players are positioning themselves. The appearance of a large downward gap like this one can signal several things: Weekend Price Action: It confirms that Bitcoin experienced significant selling pressure or downward price movement over the weekend while CME was closed. Institutional Sentiment: The lower opening price suggests that institutional participants, who primarily trade on CME, are reacting to or anticipating lower prices. Potential Price Targets: Historically, CME gaps have often been ‚Äòfilled‚Äô, meaning the spot Bitcoin price eventually moves back to trade within the range of the gap. This doesn‚Äôt always happen quickly or even at all, but it‚Äôs a phenomenon many traders observe. Understanding these gaps is a key part of sophisticated Bitcoin trading strategies, as they can sometimes act as magnets for future price movements. How Does a CME Gap Impact Bitcoin Trading Strategies? For those engaged in Bitcoin trading , a significant CME gap presents both opportunities and risks. Traders often look at these gaps as potential areas of interest. Some strategies are specifically built around the idea of gaps being filled: Gap Filling Strategy (Bullish): A trader might view a downward gap as a potential area where the price is likely to rebound to ‚Äòfill‚Äô the gap, potentially placing long trades with targets within the gap range. Gap Confirmation Strategy (Bearish): Alternatively, a trader might see the gap as confirmation of bearish momentum from the weekend, potentially looking for short opportunities if the price fails to recover or continues to fall. Volatility Alert: Regardless of the strategy, a large gap signals increased volatility. This means wider price swings are possible, requiring careful risk management. It‚Äôs important to remember that while gap filling is a historical tendency, it is by no means guaranteed. Market conditions, news events, and overall sentiment play huge roles in determining whether a gap gets filled and how quickly. CME Bitcoin Futures vs. Spot Bitcoin Market: Understanding the Difference To fully grasp the significance of the CME gap , it‚Äôs helpful to understand the distinction between CME Bitcoin futures and the spot Bitcoin market. Spot Market: This is where you buy or sell Bitcoin for immediate delivery. Exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, etc., operate 24/7/365. The price on these exchanges reflects real-time supply and demand globally. CME Bitcoin Futures: These are contracts where participants agree to buy or sell a specific amount of Bitcoin at a predetermined price on a future date. They are traded on a regulated exchange (CME) and primarily operate during traditional market hours, including a Sunday evening open. They allow participants to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin or hedge existing positions without holding the underlying asset directly. The gap occurs precisely because the CME market pauses while the spot market continues to trade. The lower opening price on CME reflects the market participants‚Äô collective assessment of where Bitcoin should be priced based on the weekend‚Äôs activity when they resume trading. What Challenges and Opportunities Does This Present for the Crypto Market? For the broader crypto market , a large downward CME gap introduces a layer of uncertainty and potential volatility. While some traders might see the lower prices reflected in the gap as a buying opportunity (anticipating a fill), others might interpret it as a sign of weakening sentiment, potentially leading to further price declines. Challenges: Increased price volatility and potential for sharp moves. Uncertainty regarding whether and when the gap might be filled. Potential for stop-loss hunting around key gap levels. Opportunities: Potential for profitable trades if the gap-filling scenario plays out. Opportunity for long-term investors to potentially acquire Bitcoin at lower prices if the spot market reacts to the gap. Enhanced understanding of institutional sentiment towards Bitcoin. It‚Äôs a reminder that the crypto market is influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including institutional activity reflected in markets like CME futures. Actionable Insights for Navigating the CME Gap Given the significant CME gap , what steps can traders and investors consider? Monitor the Spot Price: Watch how the spot Bitcoin price reacts to the CME open. Does it immediately drop to match the futures price, or does it hold steady? Assess Market Sentiment: Look at overall market news and sentiment. Is there specific news driving the weekend‚Äôs price action that created the gap? Consider Gap Filling Potential: If you are a short-term trader, evaluate the historical tendency of CME gaps to fill, but always trade with caution and stop losses. Review Risk Management: Volatility is higher around gap opens. Ensure your position sizing and stop losses are appropriate for the current market conditions. Educate Yourself: The more you understand about how markets like CME futures operate and interact with the spot market, the better equipped you will be to make informed decisions in your Bitcoin trading . This event underscores the growing maturity and complexity of the crypto market , where traditional financial instruments like futures contracts on regulated exchanges like CME play an increasingly important role. Concluding Thoughts: The $4,090 Gap‚Äôs Message The $4,090 downward gap in CME Bitcoin futures at the start of the trading week is a clear signal of significant price movement over the weekend, likely driven by factors in the 24/7 spot market. This gap is a key data point for traders and investors, offering insights into potential institutional sentiment and highlighting levels that the Bitcoin price may or may not revisit in the future. While the ‚Äògap-filling‚Äô phenomenon is a popular concept in Bitcoin trading circles, it‚Äôs essential to approach it as one potential scenario among many, always prioritizing robust risk management in the volatile crypto market . Keep a close watch on how the market reacts in the coming days; this gap could influence short-term price action.

2025-06-23T10:30:19,"Key US Economic Events Could Trigger a Massive Crypto Market Sell-Off","The post Key US Economic Events Could Trigger a Massive Crypto Market Sell-Off appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News This week could be pivotal for the crypto market as three major U.S. economic indicators come into play: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell‚Äôs testimony, jobless claims data, and the PCE inflation index. These events may drive significant volatility across Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies . Let‚Äôs break down what‚Äôs at stake. Cryptocurrency Market Overview: Bearish Sentiment Prevails The crypto market is currently under pressure , with a 2.6% decline in total market cap over the past 24 hours. Here‚Äôs a quick look at weekly performance: Bitcoin : down 4.9% Ethereum : down 14% XRP : down 8.3% BNB : down 4.8% Solana : down 14.7% Cardano : down 15.7% Dogecoin : down 14% Tron : down 1.6% Hyperliquid : down 19.8% Stellar : down 11.7% Pi Coin : down 16.3% The U.S. Economic Surprise Index‚Äîwhich measures whether economic data beats or misses expectations‚Äîis currently the most negative it has been in 2025. A weakening index often signals growing uncertainty, which can reduce risk appetite and impact crypto demand. Jerome Powell‚Äôs Testimony: Key Event for Bitcoin On June 24 , Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will testify before Congress on U.S. economic policy, employment, and inflation. His speech could directly impact crypto prices. A hawkish tone (signaling tight monetary policy) may hurt Bitcoin and boost the dollar A dovish tone (signaling easing policy) may support Bitcoin and weaken the dollar A neutral stance may cause short-term volatility In the past 14 days, Bitcoin has already dropped 3.5%, including a 0.8% decline in the last 24 hours, now hovering around $101,886. Geopolitical concerns are also rising . Iran has threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil supply route. Any escalation could impact global markets and influence Federal Reserve decisions. Jobless Claims: Another Market Trigger Last week, initial U.S. jobless claims declined from 250,000 to 245,000. This week, forecasts expect a slight increase to 247,000, supported by TEForecast models. Higher jobless claims may signal economic weakness and trigger a positive reaction in Bitcoin. Lower-than-expected claims may indicate economic strength and pressure risk assets like crypto. PCE Inflation Index: The Fed‚Äôs Preferred Inflation Metric The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index is due on June 27. This is the Fed‚Äôs key inflation gauge. In April, the PCE fell from 2.3% to 2.1% The current consensus expects a rise back to 2.3% TEForecast, however, estimates a smaller rise to 2.2% If PCE inflation beats expectations (above 2.3%), the Fed may delay rate cuts. This could strengthen the U.S. dollar and reduce investor interest in Bitcoin, leading to a further price drop. Final Thoughts This week‚Äôs market direction will depend on how these three factors unfold. Powell‚Äôs tone, jobless claims, and inflation figures will decide whether Bitcoin can regain momentum or face another sell-off. Stay tuned ‚Äî volatility is almost guaranteed. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Here are the deets. Metaplanet Lays Out Aggressive Bitcoin Timeline Crypto enthusiasts know that this was not a one-off buy. Metaplanet now aims to hold 30,000 BTC by the end of 2025, with longer-term goals set at 100,000 BTC in 2026 and 210,000 BTC by 2027.

2025-06-23T10:25:21,"Official Trump crypto bleeds $100M after U.S. strike on Iran","The Official Trump (TRUMP) cryptocurrency has taken a significant hit in recent days, shedding over $100 million in market capitalization following heightened geopolitical tensions between the United States and Iran. According to CoinMarketCap data, the token‚Äôs market cap stood at approximately $1.867 billion on June 21, before reports emerged that a U.S. B-2 stealth bomber precision strike had targeted Iranian assets. However, by June 22, market cap plummeted to $1.67 billion, marking a sharp decline of nearly 10.5%. While the token has since seen a modest rebound to $1.73 billion, the damage is clear: the speculative asset has lost considerable value in response to geopolitical stress. Trump market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap At the time of publication, TRUMP is trading at $8.66, down 14.32% over the past seven days, and over 32% from its monthly highs, a stark reversal from the parabolic rally that previously saw it surge past a $2 billion market cap. Retail FOMO meets real-world risk This retracement offers a sharp reminder of the fragility inherent in memecoins and personality-linked digital assets. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which benefit from broader institutional integration and network utility, coins like TRUMP are deeply sentiment-driven, and in this case, potentially exposed to the headline risk of President Donald Trump‚Äôs name being linked to international military conflict. Moreover, the token‚Äôs fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $8.66 billion implies a vast disconnect between circulating supply and total potential issuance. With only 200 million TRUMP currently in circulation out of a 1 billion max, any future unlocks or liquidity events could add significant downward pressure to the price. A cautionary tale for political crypto The TRUMP meme coin‚Äôs recent volatility underscores the broader risks facing politically branded cryptocurrencies. Their price action is not only driven by hype and endorsements but also by macro events, legal scrutiny, and the public perception of the figurehead they‚Äôre tied to. If the market interprets further escalation in the Middle East, the token could face renewed selling pressure, especially from speculators already locking in gains from earlier pumps.

2025-06-23T10:23:08,"Bitcoin Bounces to $102K but Crypto Market Tensions Remain (Market Watch)","The cryptocurrency market continues to experience heightened volatility, which is evident in the elevated liquidation levels across the derivatives market. Bitcoin has reclaimed the pivotal $100K mark but the broader situation remains uncertain as the industry remains under the heavy influence of macroeconomic and geopolitical events. Bitcoin Price Bounces to $102K As we reported yesterday, the conflict between Israel and Iran escalated. The US joined the war and striked three strategic Irany sites, causing immediate turmoil on international markets with crypto being no exception. In response, Iran threatened to close the Straits of Hormuz ‚Äì a critical chokepoint for oil transport, which resulted in even more highly elevated oil prices. Amid all of this, Bitcoin‚Äôs price tumbled below $100,000 for the first time since May and reached an intraday bottom at around $98,000. The bulls took control, however, and managed ot stage a recovery, with the price currently trading at slightly less than $102,000. The situation remains obviously uncertain, however, and very volatile, which can be seen by the elevated liquidaitons across derivatives markets. Coinglass reports over $600M liquidated in the past 24 hours ‚Äì that figured surpassed $1 billion yesterday.

2025-06-23T10:10:28,"Global Crypto Market Cap Sees Crucial Dip: What CoinGecko Data Reveals","BitcoinWorld Global Crypto Market Cap Sees Crucial Dip: What CoinGecko Data Reveals Hey crypto enthusiasts! Let‚Äôs dive into the latest market movements that have caught everyone‚Äôs eye. According to fresh data from CoinGecko, the global crypto market cap has experienced a dip, currently standing at $3.21 trillion . This figure reflects a 3.1% change over the past 24 hours. While daily fluctuations are common in the volatile world of digital assets, understanding the context behind these numbers is crucial for any participant in the space. Understanding the Global Crypto Market Cap What exactly is the global crypto market cap , and why does this number matter? Think of it as the total estimated value of all cryptocurrencies currently in existence. It‚Äôs calculated by multiplying the current price of each cryptocurrency by its circulating supply and then summing up all these values. It provides a snapshot of the overall size and health of the cryptocurrency market at any given moment. Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown: It‚Äôs a key metric for tracking market growth or contraction. A higher market cap generally indicates broader adoption and investor confidence. Fluctuations are normal and influenced by various factors. A 3.1% dip within 24 hours, while not catastrophic, signifies a notable movement. It suggests that selling pressure has temporarily outweighed buying activity across the board. Analyzing Bitcoin Dominance and Ethereum Dominance Beyond the total market cap, two other figures provided by CoinGecko are equally insightful: Bitcoin dominance and Ethereum dominance . Market dominance refers to the percentage of the total market cap that a specific cryptocurrency holds. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, so their dominance figures are closely watched. According to the data: Bitcoin‚Äôs market dominance is currently 62.7% . Ethereum‚Äôs market dominance is currently 8.39% . What does this tell us? Bitcoin continues to hold the lion‚Äôs share of the market‚Äôs total value. Its movements often dictate the overall market trend. Ethereum, while significantly smaller in dominance than Bitcoin, is the second-largest player and the backbone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT ecosystems, giving its dominance figure considerable weight. Changes in dominance can signal shifts in investor sentiment. For instance, if Bitcoin dominance rises during a dip, it might suggest investors are moving towards the perceived safety of BTC. Conversely, if altcoin dominance (the collective dominance of all other coins) rises, it could signal a period where investors are taking on more risk, often referred to as an ‚Äòaltcoin season‚Äô. The current figures show BTC firmly in the lead, which is typical during periods of market uncertainty or after a significant run-up. Why the Dip? Factors Influencing Cryptocurrency Prices Understanding the reasons behind a dip in the global crypto market cap requires looking at a confluence of factors that influence cryptocurrency prices . While the exact cause for any specific 24-hour movement is often complex and multifaceted, here are some common drivers: Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic news, inflation data, interest rate changes by central banks, and global political events can significantly impact risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. Regulatory News: Announcements or rumors about new regulations in major economies can create uncertainty and lead to selling pressure. Investor Sentiment and News Events: Major hacks, exchange issues, or even influential figures making positive or negative comments can sway market sentiment rapidly. Profit-Taking: After periods of significant gains, investors may sell assets to realize profits, leading to temporary dips. Technical Indicators: Traders often make decisions based on chart patterns and technical analysis, which can lead to concentrated buying or selling activity around certain price levels. Liquidation Events: In derivatives markets, large price swings can trigger cascading liquidations of leveraged positions, exacerbating downward movements. Pinpointing the precise catalyst for this 3.1% dip would require detailed analysis of market news and trading activity over the specific 24-hour period. However, it‚Äôs likely a combination of these factors contributing to the overall shift. The Impact of a Market Dip: Challenges and Opportunities A dip in the global crypto market cap presents both challenges and potential opportunities for market participants. Challenges: Increased Volatility: Dips can be sharp and unpredictable, making it difficult for short-term traders. Investor Psychology: Seeing portfolio values decrease can lead to panic selling, locking in losses. Uncertainty: It can be hard to determine if a dip is a temporary correction or the start of a longer downturn. Opportunities: Potential Buying Opportunities: For long-term investors, dips can offer a chance to buy assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum at lower prices. Learning Experience: Market volatility provides valuable lessons in risk management and emotional control. Re-evaluation: Dips encourage investors to revisit their portfolios and investment strategies. It‚Äôs important to approach market dips with a clear head and a well-defined strategy rather than reacting impulsively to short-term price movements. Actionable Insights for Navigating Market Volatility Given the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency prices , especially during market dips, what can investors do? Here are some actionable insights: 1. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand the projects you invest in. A temporary market dip doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean a good project has failed. Focus on fundamentals. 2. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market dip perfectly, invest a fixed amount at regular intervals (e.g., weekly or monthly). This averages out your purchase price over time and reduces the risk of buying only at peaks. 3. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket. While Bitcoin and Ethereum hold significant dominance, exploring other promising projects can spread risk. However, ensure you understand each asset. 4. Have a Long-Term Perspective: The crypto market has historically experienced significant volatility but has shown resilience and long-term growth. Focusing on the long game can help weather short-term downturns. 5. Set Stop-Loss Orders: For traders, using stop-loss orders can help limit potential losses if the market moves against your position. 6. Stay Informed, But Avoid Constant Monitoring: Keep up with major news impacting the market, but avoid checking prices every five minutes, which can fuel anxiety. Navigating dips requires discipline and a focus on your personal financial goals and risk tolerance. Looking Ahead: What Could Influence the Market Next? While the 3.1% dip is the current focus, the market is constantly looking for the next catalyst. Factors that could influence the global crypto market cap and cryptocurrency prices in the near future include: Further macroeconomic data releases (inflation, jobs reports). Regulatory developments in key regions (US, EU, Asia). Technological advancements and upgrades within major networks (like Ethereum‚Äôs ongoing development). Increased institutional adoption or investment. Significant movements in the stock market, particularly tech stocks, which crypto often correlates with. Keeping an eye on these potential influencers can help provide context for future market movements, whether they lead to recovery or further dips. Conclusion: A Snapshot of Market Dynamics The recent 3.1% dip in the global crypto market cap to $3.21 trillion, as reported by CoinGecko, serves as a fresh reminder of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While Bitcoin dominance remains strong at 62.7% and Ethereum dominance at 8.39%, the overall market valuation saw a notable contraction in 24 hours. Understanding these key metrics ‚Äì market cap, dominance, and the factors influencing cryptocurrency prices ‚Äì is vital for making informed decisions. Market dips are a normal part of the cycle, presenting challenges related to volatility and sentiment but also potential opportunities for those with a clear strategy and a long-term perspective. As the market continues to evolve, staying informed and disciplined remains key to navigating its unpredictable waters.

2025-06-23T10:10:12,"FTX lawyers reject 3AC‚Äôs $1.53B claim","Collapsed crypto exchange FTX lawyers have rejected a $1.53 billion recovery claim from Three Arrows Capital‚Äôs liquidators. The firm‚Äôs lawyers argued that the losses resulted from a risky trading strategy that should not be paid for by creditors. 3AC liquidators initially filed a $120 million claim in FTX‚Äôs bankruptcy case in June 2023 and expanded it to $1.53 billion in November 2024. The company alleged claims including breach of contract, fiduciary duty, and unjust enrichment. FTX accuses 3AC of risky leveraged strategy The hedge fund alleged FTX held $1.53 billion in its assets that were liquidated to settle liabilities in 2022, contributing to 3AC‚Äôs collapse. The firm argued that the transactions were avoidable and the defunct crypto exchange‚Äôs debtors had delayed providing the information that would have uncovered the liquidations. Chief Judge John Dorsey sided with 3AC and granted the motion in March. FTX filed an objection on Friday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, its lawyers maintaining that the claims were illogical and baseless. They also argued that the hedge fund ‚Äúbet big‚Äù that crypto prices would increase, and when they instead dropped, the company became a victim of its ‚Äúown risky strategy.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Joint Liquidators ask this Court to force other Exchange customers and creditors to foot the bill for 3AC‚Äôs failed strategy by asserting illogical and baseless claims for $1.53 billion.‚Äù -FTX Lawyers. The lawyers also disputed the account balance and how 3AC arrived at the $1.53 billion figure. They believe the firm relied on inaccurate account balances from June 12, 2022, when the company‚Äôs crypto balance was $1.02 billion, not $1.59 billion, and the negative U.S. dollar amount was $733 million, not $1.3 billion. The theory of lost assets, which FTX believes is the crux of 3AC‚Äôs argument, is based on the crypto balance on June 12, 2022, and asks to recover all of the balance lost in subsequent days. The lawyers said it‚Äôs a false premise and lacks any legal or factual merit, and that 3AC is owed nothing. The collapsed crypto exchange maintains that 3AC only had an available balance of $284 million, which was further chipped away by crypto market price declines and withdrawals by 3AC of $60 million. FTX also revealed that the Singapore-based firm had a negative USD balance and a positive digital asset balance at the end of the day on June 12, 2022. Lawyers acting for FTX noted in the objection that the only liquidation against 3AC was for $82 million in crypto. They argued that the amount was contractually permitted under the credit and margin agreements to ensure the firm complied with account balance requirements. The lawyers also claimed in the objection that the liquidation did not reduce the overall account balance because the value was added to the fiat 3AC account in USD. FTX said the $82 million liquidation benefited 3AC by preserving the value of its accounts. The Singapore-based hedge fund has until July 11 to file a reply to FTX‚Äôs objection. A non-evidentiary hearing is also set for August 12 before Chief Judge Karen Owens in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. 3AC files $1.3B claim against Terraform Labs In August last year, 3AC also pursued claims against collapsed crypto firm Terraform Labs through a $1.3 billion claim in Terra‚Äôs bankruptcy case. The hedge fund‚Äôs liquidators alleged that Terraform Labs misled 3AC about the stability of tokens in the Terra ecosystem, including Terra‚Äôs algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST), and the UST-tied token Luna (LUNA). The liquidators, represented by Russell Crumpler and Christopher Farmer of Teneo Holding, argued that Terraform Labs advertised the tokens in a manner that inflated the price of the assets. Those misrepresentations induced 3AC to invest heavily in Terra just a few months after UST depegged from the dollar, causing a massive crash in the Terra ecosystem, and implicating several companies. 3AC liquidators were seeking damages caused by its direct purchases of UST and LUNA and associated damages from the complete loss of value of its crypto investments caused by the collapse of LUNA and UST. On March 30, Terraform opened a claims portal for investors affected by its collapse.

Elon Musk's X plans in-app trading and payments but makes no mention of Dogecoin integration despite his historical support. Bitcoin Pepe smashes $15.2m presale as world's first Bitcoin meme ICO builds ""Solana on Bitcoin"" toward June 30th exchange announcement. The meme coin space is far more diverse than anyone could have predicted a few years ago. Among the flagship meme projects, Dogecoin‚Äîthe OG that started it all‚Äîhas evolved into something resembling a vast ecosystem with real institutional interest, ETF speculation, and integration into major platforms like Coinbase's Base network. What began essentially as a joke has become a $25B market cap phenomenon that's weathered practically every storm in crypto. Dogecoin's recent performance indicates its status as a maturing asset. Recording yearly gains of 35% to date, and much higher in its early spring peak, DOGE has shown remarkable resilience despite volatility across traditional markets. Recent speculation about a potential DOGE ETF has intensified, with prediction markets giving it around a 50-50 chance of SEC approval by the end of 2025. But there's something entirely different happening on the other side of the meme coin universe. Bitcoin Pepe might belong superficially to the ""Pepe"" category of meme coins, but only on the surface. Underneath the familiar branding lies something unprecedented‚Äîthe world's first meme coin ICO launched directly on Bitcoin, building infrastructure that could fundamentally change how the oldest blockchain functions. Bitcoin Pepe chose Bitcoin specifically to solve its seven-transaction-per-second limitation while building on crypto's most trusted foundation. The core innovation is the PEP-20 token standard, which promises to deliver thousands of transactions per second to Bitcoin's ecosystem, essentially creating ""Solana on Bitcoin"" functionality. With an incredible $15.2m raised and confirmed tier 1 exchange listings ahead of June 30th announcements, the market is clearly taking this seriously. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP): Building the future of Bitcoin infrastructure Bitcoin Pepe is attempting something that sounds impossible‚Äîmaking Bitcoin fast while keeping it secure. Departing from the traditional meme coin formula, the team wanted to solve the biggest problem holding Bitcoin back from modern applications. It‚Äôs ambitious, but the market is backing it sincerely. For example, every staking pool sold out completely, with participants locking tokens for yields ranging from 75% up to a vast 10,000% APY. An astonishing $15.2m has so far been raised in the ongoing presale. The team is now in the process of onboarding additional tier 1 exchange partnerships, with MEXC and BitMart already secured, triggering $300K in immediate buying activity. June 30th will reveal which other major exchanges are joining and could see the price rocket as the presale sails past $15M. We've just seen ANOTHER major pump! $BPEP just hit $15 MILLION raised. üí™Since dropping our listing announcements, $BPEP has gone parabolic.

This team is building comprehensive infrastructure rather than pinning hopes on a viral price rush. With positioning available at $0.0416 in the current stage, this might be the last chance to get in before Bitcoin Pepe hits public markets and the real price discovery begins. The window is closing fast to get involved with the best crypto to buy now, both for short-term price action and long-term utility play. Dogecoin (DOGE): The institutional meme coin Dogecoin has earned its status as crypto's most beloved success story. Created in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to Bitcoin, DOGE has survived multiple bear markets, regulatory uncertainty, and countless predictions of its demise. The current technical setup has traders watching closely. After finding support near $0.167, DOGE is consolidating around $0.17 while showing signs of accumulation. Companies accept DOGE for payments, fans use it for tips and small transactions, and the community remains one of crypto's most engaged. Elon Musk's influence remains a wildcard factor. While his recent X payment announcements didn't specifically mention Dogecoin, his historical support has proven capable of moving markets. For crypto veterans, Dogecoin represents authenticity in a space increasingly dominated by complex protocols and venture capital. It exists because someone thought putting a dog meme on a blockchain would be fun, an origin story that resonates through every grassroots crypto project like Bitcoin Pepe itself. Bitcoin is set to evolve Dogecoin and Bitcoin Pepe represent completely different philosophies. DOGE offers the stability of a proven community with growing institutional recognition. Bitcoin Pepe bets on being the first to crack Bitcoin's utility problem while introducing meme culture appeal. Bitcoin Pepe's announcements about exchanges on June 30th could trigger the kind of coordinated launch that transforms presale projects into market phenomena. Ranking among the best crypto to buy now, it‚Äôs totally unexposed to the masses‚Äîfor now, at least. Bitcoin Pepe's window is closing fast, though. With confirmed MEXC and Bitmart listings and rumors about bigger exchanges joining June 30th announcements, positioning at $0.0416 might be the last chance before this hits public markets. Once those exchange partnerships get announced, presale access ends forever. Bitcoin Pepe's presale window is rapidly closing. With confirmed MEXC and Bitmart listings and rumors of larger exchanges joining by June 30th, current positioning at $0.0416 may be the last opportunity before public market entry.

2025-06-23T10:00:25,"Spot Bitcoin ETFs Now Hold Massive 6.13% of BTC Supply, Signaling Growth","BitcoinWorld Spot Bitcoin ETFs Now Hold Massive 6.13% of BTC Supply, Signaling Growth Hey crypto enthusiasts! Get ready for a significant update that underscores the growing influence of traditional finance in the digital asset space. We‚Äôre talking about Spot Bitcoin ETFs , and their holdings have just hit a massive milestone that‚Äôs turning heads across the Crypto Market . According to data compiled by @hildobby_ on Dune Analytics, Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States now collectively control a substantial portion of the total BTC supply . This isn‚Äôt just a small percentage; it‚Äôs a figure that highlights the rapid pace of Institutional Bitcoin adoption since these products launched earlier this year. Understanding the Massive Spot Bitcoin ETF Holdings Let‚Äôs break down the numbers that are making waves: Percentage of Total BTC Supply: 6.13% Combined On-Chain Holdings: 1,218,000 BTC Approximate Value: $121.2 billion (based on market prices at the time of data collection) These figures, derived from on-chain data tracked by reliable sources like Dune Analytics, demonstrate a clear trend: institutions and large-scale investors are using the Spot Bitcoin ETF structure to gain exposure to Bitcoin in a regulated and familiar way. The fact that over 6% of the entire BTC supply is now held within these wrappers is a powerful indicator of institutional appetite. What Does This Massive Influx of Institutional Bitcoin Signify? The accumulation of 1.218 million BTC by Spot Bitcoin ETFs is far more than just a statistic; it‚Äôs a strong signal for the entire Crypto Market . Here‚Äôs what this surge in Institutional Bitcoin holdings tells us: Validation as an Asset Class: Large institutions, pension funds, and asset managers are increasingly comfortable treating Bitcoin as a legitimate investment asset, worthy of significant allocation. Increased Liquidity and Accessibility: ETFs provide an easy way for investors who cannot or prefer not to hold physical Bitcoin directly to participate in its price movements. This expands the pool of potential investors dramatically. Maturing Market Infrastructure: The success and growth of these ETFs reflect the maturing infrastructure around Bitcoin, including regulated custodians, trading platforms, and data providers. This level of commitment from traditional finance players via Spot Bitcoin ETFs adds a layer of stability and legitimacy that was less apparent in earlier cycles of the Crypto Market . It signifies a deeper integration of Bitcoin into the global financial system. How Spot Bitcoin ETFs Are Reshaping the BTC Supply Landscape One of the most direct impacts of these massive holdings is on the available BTC supply . Bitcoin has a finite supply capped at 21 million coins. When large amounts are held in long-term investment vehicles like ETFs, it reduces the amount of Bitcoin actively trading on exchanges or held by short-term speculators. Think of it this way: the 1.218 million BTC held by Spot Bitcoin ETFs are essentially locked away for the investors in those funds. While ETF shares trade, the underlying Bitcoin is typically held by a custodian and not readily available for sale on the open market by the ETF manager unless inflows reverse significantly. This dynamic can lead to a supply squeeze, especially if demand continues to grow. With a significant portion of the circulating BTC supply moving into these institutional vaults, any sustained buying pressure could have a more pronounced effect on price than it would in a market where supply is more fragmented and readily available. The Ripple Effect on the Wider Crypto Market The success of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and the resulting surge in Institutional Bitcoin holdings have broader implications for the entire Crypto Market : Increased Awareness and Confidence: The prominent presence of Bitcoin ETFs managed by household names like BlackRock and Fidelity brings Bitcoin into mainstream financial conversations, increasing awareness and potentially confidence among retail investors. Paving the Way for Other Crypto Assets: The regulatory approval and market success of Bitcoin ETFs could set a precedent for ETFs tracking other cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum, potentially opening up new avenues for institutional and retail investment in the future. Shift in Market Structure: While retail investors remain crucial, the increasing dominance of institutional holdings could influence market volatility patterns and trading strategies. This shift indicates a maturation of the Crypto Market , moving beyond its early, primarily retail-driven phase into one where institutional capital plays a significant role. Navigating the Future of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Institutional Bitcoin The accumulation of over 6% of the BTC supply by Spot Bitcoin ETFs is undoubtedly a bullish signal, highlighting strong demand for Institutional Bitcoin products. However, it‚Äôs also important to consider potential challenges and future dynamics: Continued Inflows: Will the pace of accumulation continue? This depends on market performance, regulatory environment, and broader economic conditions. Concentration Risk: While diversification is inherent within the ETF structure, the concentration of a significant portion of BTC supply in a few large funds could introduce new systemic risks, although this is mitigated by the distributed nature of Bitcoin itself. Regulatory Landscape: Future regulatory decisions could impact the operation and growth of these funds. For investors, this development reinforces Bitcoin‚Äôs position as a major asset class attracting serious capital. It suggests that the trend of institutional adoption is likely to continue, potentially providing a strong foundation for future price appreciation, though market volatility remains a factor. In Conclusion: A Landmark Moment for Bitcoin The fact that Spot Bitcoin ETFs now command over 6% of the total BTC supply is a landmark moment. It underscores the rapid and significant adoption of Bitcoin by institutional players, validating its role in modern investment portfolios. With over 1.2 million BTC under management, valued at over $121 billion, these ETFs are not just a new product; they are reshaping the dynamics of the BTC supply and signaling a new era for the entire Crypto Market driven by increasing Institutional Bitcoin participation. This growth story is far from over, and its implications will continue to unfold.

2025-06-23T09:53:01,"Bitcoin Bounces After War-Driven Dip, $98.2K Emerges as Key Level to Maintain Bullish Momentum","The short-term holder realized price (STH RP) for bitcoin BTC currently sits at $98,200, representing the average on-chain acquisition price for bitcoin {BTC} held outside of exchange reserves and moved within the last 155 days. This metric, derived using on-chain heuristics, helps distinguish between short and long-term holders and provides insight into market sentiment, according to Glassnode data. Realized price refers to the average acquisition price for the entire circulating bitcoin supply, based on the last time each coin moved on-chain. STH RP narrows this down to more recently active coins, which are statistically more likely to be spent. These are often the most sensitive to market volatility. Over the weekend, bitcoin dipped amid geopolitical tensions, driven by escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, and growing fears of escalation between U.S. and Iran. With traditional markets closed, investors responded by selling liquid assets like bitcoin not necessarily out of desire, but necessity. Historically, when bitcoin trades above the STH RP, it typically signals a bullish trend. Conversely, trading below the STH RP is often associated with bearish or consolidation phases. For example, from June to October 2024, ahead of the U.S. presidential election, bitcoin remained below the STH RP which was around $62,000 at the time. Similarly, in February to April 2025, prices again fell under this threshold which was around $92,000. Bitcoin has rebounded strongly, climbing back above $100,000 and now trading around $101,000.

2025-06-23T09:50:13,"Shocking Crypto Market Dip: Geopolitical Events Trigger $1B Liquidations & Bitcoin Price Fall","BitcoinWorld Shocking Crypto Market Dip: Geopolitical Events Trigger $1B Liquidations & Bitcoin Price Fall The cryptocurrency market experienced a sudden and significant downturn, sending ripples of concern through the investment community. This latest crypto market dip appears closely linked to escalating global tensions, specifically following reports of U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. The swift reaction across digital asset prices highlighted the market‚Äôs sensitivity to external geopolitical factors, leading to substantial losses for many holders. Geopolitical Events Trigger Market Turmoil While often touted as a decentralized and uncorrelated asset class, cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, have shown increasing sensitivity to macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. The recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites served as a stark reminder of this connection. Such events typically trigger a ‚Äòrisk-off‚Äô sentiment across global financial markets, where investors tend to move away from perceived higher-risk assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies towards safer havens like gold or government bonds. The news broke, and the immediate reaction in the crypto space was a sharp price decline across the board. This rapid sell-off demonstrated how quickly external, non-crypto-specific events can influence market dynamics and investor behavior. Massive Crypto Liquidations Exceed $1 Billion One of the most dramatic consequences of the sudden price drop was a cascade of crypto liquidations . According to data reported by The Block, citing CoinGlass figures, daily liquidations surged past the $1 billion mark. Liquidations occur in the leveraged trading market. Traders use borrowed funds to increase their position size. If the market moves against their position significantly, their collateral is insufficient to cover potential losses, and the exchange automatically closes their position. The scale of over $1 billion in liquidations within a 24-hour period underscores the severity and speed of the market correction. This event primarily impacted traders holding long positions (betting on prices going up), who were caught off guard by the sharp downturn. Mass liquidations can also exacerbate price falls, as the forced selling adds further downward pressure on the market. Understanding liquidations is crucial for anyone involved in leveraged crypto trading. It highlights the inherent risks associated with using borrowed capital in such a volatile environment. The $1 billion figure serves as a powerful illustration of the financial leverage present in the market and the potential consequences of sudden price swings. Bitcoin Price Fall: A Brief Dip Below $100k As the market reacted to the geopolitical news and subsequent liquidations, the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), experienced a notable Bitcoin price fall . According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin briefly dipped below the significant psychological and technical level of $100,000. This marked the first time BTC had traded below this threshold in approximately 45 days, causing concern among investors who had grown accustomed to its recent stability above this level. While the drop was sharp, Bitcoin showed some resilience, quickly rebounding to trade around $100,735.18 shortly after. This relatively swift recovery from the sub-$100k level suggests underlying buying interest remains, or that the initial panic selling subsided relatively quickly. However, the breach of this key level, even if brief, signals increased volatility and potential uncertainty in the near term. Bitcoin‚Äôs ability to hold relatively steadier compared to other assets during such downturns is often attributed to its larger market capitalization and deeper liquidity. However, even the market leader is not immune to significant price movements triggered by major external events. The Altcoin Market Reaction: Bigger Losses While Bitcoin saw a significant price fall, the impact on the broader altcoin market reaction was even more pronounced. Altcoins, which are cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, generally experienced larger percentage losses during this downturn. This is a common pattern observed during crypto market corrections. Why do altcoins often suffer more? Higher Volatility: Altcoins, especially smaller-cap ones, are typically more volatile than Bitcoin. Their prices can swing more dramatically in either direction. Lower Liquidity: Many altcoins have lower trading volumes and less liquidity than Bitcoin. This means that relatively smaller sell orders can have a larger impact on their price. Risk Perception: In a ‚Äòrisk-off‚Äô environment, investors tend to flee towards perceived safer assets. Within the crypto space, Bitcoin is often seen as the least risky asset compared to the vast and diverse altcoin market. Leverage: High leverage in altcoin perpetual futures markets can lead to cascading liquidations that accelerate price declines. The recent dip highlighted this disparity, with many altcoins seeing double-digit percentage losses while Bitcoin‚Äôs drop was comparatively less severe. This reinforces the idea that while altcoins offer potential for higher returns, they also come with significantly higher risk, particularly during periods of market stress. Impact on Bitcoin ETF Inflows The market dip also coincided with a change in the trend for Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). After a notable nine-day streak of positive inflows, June 20 saw a dip in inflows. Coupled with the subsequent price fall, this suggests the inflow streak may come to an end on June 23, depending on the day‚Äôs activity. Consistent ETF inflows have been a significant bullish factor for Bitcoin in recent months, indicating growing institutional and traditional investor interest. A pause or reversal in this trend, even if temporary, could signal a shift in short-term sentiment or a reaction from institutional players to the increased market volatility and the broader geopolitical impact crypto is experiencing. Monitoring ETF flows remains a key indicator for gauging institutional participation and sentiment in the Bitcoin market. Understanding the Geopolitical Impact on Crypto The notion that cryptocurrencies are entirely detached from traditional finance and global politics is increasingly being challenged. While their underlying technology is decentralized, their price is determined by supply and demand within a market that is populated by participants who are also affected by global events. Here‚Äôs how geopolitical events can influence crypto: Impact Factor Explanation Risk-Off Sentiment Global instability causes investors to reduce exposure to perceived risky assets, including crypto. Safe-Haven Narrative Conversely, some view Bitcoin as a potential safe haven during times of currency devaluation or political instability, although this narrative is debated and not always reflected in price action during global crises. Sanctions & Regulations Geopolitical conflicts can lead to discussions or implementations of stricter regulations on cryptocurrencies to prevent their use in illicit activities or circumventing sanctions. Economic Uncertainty Events impacting global trade, energy prices, or economic stability can influence overall market liquidity and investor confidence, affecting crypto demand. The recent dip underscores the importance of considering the broader global landscape when analyzing cryptocurrency market movements. While internal factors like technological developments and adoption rates are crucial, external forces can trigger significant and rapid price changes. Conclusion: Navigating Volatility in the Crypto Market The recent crypto market dip , triggered by geopolitical tensions and resulting in over $1 billion in liquidations and a temporary Bitcoin price fall below $100k, serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility in the digital asset space. The amplified altcoin market reaction further highlights the varying risk profiles within the ecosystem. While painful for those caught off guard, such events are not uncommon in this relatively young and rapidly evolving market. Investors should understand that external factors, including geopolitical impact crypto , can significantly influence prices. Managing risk, avoiding excessive leverage, and maintaining a long-term perspective are often cited as prudent strategies when navigating these turbulent periods. As the market digests the impact of recent events, vigilance and informed decision-making remain paramount.

BTC recovered during early Monday trading in Asia, rebounding to around $101,871 at the time of writing. The swift recovery underscores ongoing market sensitivity to geopolitical developments, while also highlighting the strength of near-term technical support. Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and other major altcoins extended last week‚Äôs losses. Bitcoin now hovers near a key support level at $100,000. A decisive close below this threshold could signal a deeper correction, with the next downside target near Sunday‚Äôs intraday low of $98,200. Market participants remain cautious, with geopolitical risk continuing to drive volatility across both crypto and traditional asset classes. In this volatile environment, one early-stage project that has consistently garnered investor interest is Bitcoin Pepe . The project‚Äôs presale continued to see strong inflows even in this risk-off environment. Middle East tensions weigh on sentiments The Israel-Iran conflict entered its 11th day on Monday, June 23, with Israel‚Äôs military confirming strikes on surface-to-surface missile launch sites in western Iran. The development follows a significant escalation on June 13, when Israel carried out large-scale attacks targeting Iranian missile infrastructure, nuclear facilities, and senior military officials. Aerial assaults continued into Monday, intensifying after the US launched bunker-buster bomb strikes over the weekend on three of Iran‚Äôs nuclear sites. The Trump administration has described the strikes as a targeted effort to degrade Tehran‚Äôs nuclear capabilities. President Donald Trump declared that the US operation had ‚Äúobliterated‚Äù Iran‚Äôs nuclear program, though senior officials noted that it remains too early to fully assess the extent of the damage. Iran has sharply condemned the US involvement, accusing Washington of crossing ‚Äúa very big red line.‚Äù Tehran responded with a warning that it would retaliate against what it sees as direct American aggression. Despite the military escalation, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that the administration ‚Äúdoes not seek war‚Äù and reiterated an interest in returning to diplomatic engagement. Bitcoin Pepe shows strength The crypto market has experienced heightened volatility in recent months, marked by sharp rallies, steep corrections, and fluctuating investor sentiment. Amid this backdrop, the Bitcoin Pepe presale has remained resilient, continuing to draw consistent capital inflows. The sustained interest suggests the project may be well-positioned to navigate current market conditions. Billed as the first meme-centric Layer 2 built on the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin Pepe aims to redefine meme tokens by combining Bitcoin‚Äôs base-layer security with the scalability features more commonly associated with chains like Solana. This integration of infrastructure strength with cultural relevance sets it apart from many meme tokens that lack underlying technical substance. To support the growth of its Layer 2 ecosystem, Bitcoin Pepe has formed strategic partnerships with Super Meme, Catamoto, and Plena Finance. The project‚Äôs dual approach‚Äîmerging functional utility with meme-driven momentum‚Äîis gaining market traction. The development team has also shared visuals of ongoing infrastructure progress to enhance transparency and build trust. The presale has already raised over $15.3 million, with BPEP tokens priced at $0.0416. The token is set to be listed on MEXC and BitMart, a move expected to boost liquidity, increase visibility, and reinforce market credibility. An additional listing announcement is anticipated on June 30, adding to investor interest as the presale nears completion.

From $39M to $4M ‚Äì The Shocking Slide It all began on June 8, when AguilaTrades created a new wallet and moved $39.18 million worth of USDC from Bybit to Hyperliquid, a trading platform used for perpetual BTC contracts.

2025-06-23T09:34:22,"73% of Youngsters Favour Bitcoin for Long-Term Investment Over Gold: Study","A recent poll revealed that investors aged 24 to 45 see Bitcoin as a potential for ‚Äúexponential upside‚Äù over gold. A survey of 730 Gen Z and Millennial investors by financial advisory giant deVere Group found that 73% of respondents preferred Bitcoin. According to deVere CEO, Nigel Green, Bitcoin and gold are not rivals but ‚Äú radically different assets ‚Äù and solve different problems. ‚ÄúGold is stability. Bitcoin is growth. If you want to build and protect wealth over the long term, you should be holding both.‚Äù The survey aligns with several other studies that imply a seismic shift from traditional investments toward Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance as a safe-haven asset. For instance, on-chain analytics company CryptoQuant revealed in January that over 60% of cryptocurrency investors are aged between 25 and 44 years old. ‚ÄúThe momentum behind Bitcoin among younger investors is undeniable ,‚Äù says Green. ‚ÄúThey see it as digital gold ‚Äì borderless, accessible, and aligned with the future.‚Äù Bitcoin Enthusiasm is Growing Younger investors view Bitcoin as a ‚Äúcornerstone of modern portfolios,‚Äù the survey noted . The younger cohort gets attracted to transparency, portability, and potential for exponential surge. Respondents also said that Bitcoin‚Äôs operation outside the traditional banking system is a notable advantage. ‚ÄúThis generation is right to question the old models. But diversification is timeless,‚Äù said Green. Last week, the CEO of Bitwise Asset Management, Hunter Horsley, posted on X, comparing Bitcoin to US Treasuries, rather than gold. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think Bitcoin‚Äôs competition is going to end up being gold,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúRather, I think Bitcoin‚Äôs competition is going to end up being U.S. Treasuries and other governments‚Äô bonds.‚Äù I don't think Bitcoin's competition is going to end up being gold.

Rather, I think Bitcoin's competition is going to end up being U.S. Treasuries and‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) June 20, 2025 Gold, Bitcoin Together Offer Balance According to Nigel Green, having uncorrelated assets in portfolios is a pathway for building true resilience. ‚ÄúGold and Bitcoin together offer that balance,‚Äù he said. He also stressed that Bitcoin is moving toward broader acceptance, particularly after spot ETFs and broader corporate adoption, adding legitimacy and fresh demand. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre living through a rare convergence,‚Äù Green added. ‚ÄúYou have the old guard doubling down on gold, and the new guard surging into Bitcoin.

Their combined holdings exceed 800K BTC and are worth over $88 billion. The real estate titan‚Äôs decision to pursue 4,000 total Bitcoins represents over $400 million in digital asset exposure at current prices. Source: Cryptonews This institutional adoption wave has accelerated dramatically following Bitcoin‚Äôs rally to $111,965 in May, spurring companies across diverse industries to race for Bitcoin exposure while investor appetite remains strong. Institutional Bitcoin Buying Frenzy Reaches $1.5B Monthly Peak June 2025 has witnessed an extraordinary surge in corporate Bitcoin accumulation, with major institutional players deploying over $1.5 billion across multiple high-profile purchases. This represents the largest monthly corporate buying spree in Bitcoin‚Äôs history. Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has emerged as the most aggressive buyer, adding 1,111 Bitcoin for $118.2 million just days ago , bringing their total holdings to 11,111 BTC valued at over $1.07 billion. The company‚Äôs ambitious 210,000 Bitcoin target by 2027 would represent approximately 1% of Bitcoin‚Äôs maximum supply, with CEO Simon Gerovich declaring this ‚ÄúAsia‚Äôs largest-ever equity raise to buy Bitcoin.‚Äù MicroStrategy continues leading the corporate adoption charge with multiple purchases throughout June, including 10,100 Bitcoin for $1.05 billion , bringing their total holdings to approximately 592,100 BTC worth over $60 billion. The company‚Äôs relentless accumulation strategy has inspired a global wave of imitators, with healthcare company Prenetics investing $20 million for 187.42 BTC , Norwegian firm K33 targeting 1,000 BTC through a $9 million share issue, and UK-listed Smarter Web Company adding 45.32 BTC to reach 168.08 total holdings. This buying wave is geographically diverse, spanning Japan‚Äôs capital markets to Europe‚Äôs regulated exchanges and North America‚Äôs public companies. Most notably, Metaplanet‚Äôs financing mechanisms include 555 million moving-strike warrants capable of raising $5.4 billion to facilitate massive Bitcoin accumulation strategies. The company‚Äôs quarter-to-date Bitcoin yield of 107.9% has attracted significant institutional attention, and its stock has surged over 408% year-to-date. Technical Analysis Reveals Critical Resistance Despite Institutional Support Despite the massive institutional buying pressure, Bitcoin‚Äôs technical structure reveals signs of weakness, suggesting the current rally may be losing momentum. Source: TehThomas on TradingView The hourly chart analysis shows Bitcoin experiencing a ‚Äúfake-out‚Äù following an initial sweep higher that failed to sustain momentum. The asset is currently trading around $101,988 after breaking down from an ascending channel pattern. The breakdown of this technical structure occurred despite massive institutional capital injection, indicating that supply pressure from existing holders may be overwhelming the new institutional demand. The 15-minute timeframe provides even more granular evidence of supply-demand imbalance, with Bitcoin trapped within a distribution pattern where red supply zones are successfully containing rallies while demand zones around $98,500-99,500 represent the next major support confluence. The order flow data also reveals a telling pattern of aggressive selling activity at resistance levels above $100,800, with multiple red entries indicating that sellers are using any strength to distribute positions. This suggests that while institutional purchases provide temporary support, the prevailing market structure favors sellers capitalizing on institutional buying to exit positions. The detailed hourly analysis with order flow shows Bitcoin testing the critical $100,000 psychological barrier while facing resistance from the 65-period exponential moving average at $102,451 and the 200-period EMA at $104,109. The time and sales data reveal consistent selling pressure, with green buy entries quickly absorbed by red sell entries at higher price levels. This indicates that institutional buying may occur at technically disadvantageous levels. The combination of broken technical support around $103,000-104,000, bearish moving average configuration, and negative order flow dynamics suggests that Bitcoin could face continued downside pressure toward $98,000-99,000 despite the institutional capital injection.

Strategy‚Äôs founder and Bitcoin advocate, Michael Saylor, congratulated the move, replying to Cardone with, ‚ÄúCongratulations on acquiring 1000 BTC.‚Äù The American real estate mogul revealed that the $5B group currently had over 14.2K units to its name and was looking forward to adding 5K units this year, along with another purchase of about 3K BTC. The strategy combines cash-flowing real estate with Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term upside, creating a portfolio that Cardone described as ‚Äútwo best-in-class assets.‚Äù The Cardone Capital Group said it was ready to partner with Grant to invest in ‚Äúcryptorized‚Äù real estate. Cardone Capital invests $15.6M in BTC to diversify beyond real estate On June 20th, the group revealed that it acquired 150 BTC worth around $15.6 million as part of its plan to diversify holdings beyond real estate. Grant had claimed almost a week earlier, on June 14th, that real estate market was broken and he was going to fix it using the real estate/BTC model. He said this as the group unveiled a $1.6 billion five-year dual-asset investment strategy that would increase Bitcoin investments and reduce focus on real estate. Grant further explained that this was the fifth fund this year, and the ‚ÄúBoca Deal‚Äù was almost filled. A summary infographic report showed that the group planned to reduce real estate allocations from 77% in year one to 45% in year five. It also showed that BTC allocations would increase from 33% to 66% within the same period. The data also revealed that the company had so far invested nearly $100 million in Bitcoin and over $1 billion in real estate, with plans to increase future investments by a minimum of $5 million. According to the Cardone Capital Group, its initial BTC position allocated $290 million to buy 2.914K BTC at an average price of $100K per BTC. The group claimed that additional BTC would be purchased using $140 million of monthly cash flow from real estate holdings within the next five years. The company added that it would invest in institutional-grade cold storage to ensure security and align its long-term BTC hold strategy with macro Bitcoin market cycles. Cardone joins a growing list of institutions adopting Bitcoin reserves A U.S. SEC filing earlier this month revealed that Hong Kong-based real estate and logistics company Reitar Logtech planned to purchase up to $1.5 billion in Bitcoin as part of its treasury diversification strategy. John Chan, Chairman and CEO of Reitar Logtech, said the treasury diversification initiative emphasized his company‚Äôs commitment to maintain a strong financial foundation while scaling its global logistics technology platform. DDC Enterprise also raised approximately $528 million to accelerate its Bitcoin treasury strategy. The company‚Äôs founder, Chairwoman, and CEO, Norma Chu, said the funding was expected to propel DDC into one of the top global corporate Bitcoin holders. Prenetics also became the first healthcare firm to launch a Bitcoin treasury strategy with a $20 million BTC purchase. The company acquired 187.42 BTC at an average price of $106,712 and stated that its board had approved allocating the majority of its $117 million balance sheet to Bitcoin. Prenetics plans to expand its Bitcoin holdings through institutional capital partnerships and to implement advanced return strategies. It also plans to accept Bitcoin payments across its direct-to-consumer platforms, including IM8 Health and CircleDNA. Metaplanet , Strategy, Tesla, MARA, and others continued to acquire more BTC as two academic researchers, Murray Rudd and Dennis Porter, predicted that Bitcoin could soar to $4.3 million by 2036 if these institutional buying trends continued.

2025-06-23T09:28:45,"Bitcoin Week Ahead: Focus on Powell's Testimony, U.S. Core PCE as Tariff Deadline Looms","The calm in the oil market following the U.S. airstrike on Iran's nuclear sites has dashed the forecasts of bears who predicted a slide in the price of bitcoin BTC. With this in mind, traders can look to the week's major events that could affect markets. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's semi-annual monetary policy testimony to Congress is likely to be the main event. Powell will probably be grilled by Republican party members for not cutting interest rates and ""costing the country hundreds of billions of dollars,"" as President Donald Trump has repeatedly said in his Truth Social posts. Powell, however, is expected to reiterate the Fed's independence and the data-dependent path forward for rates. Traders will closely watch Powell's take on the interest-rate trajectory, given the backdrop of Trump-appointed Fed Governor Christopher Waller's recent comments that interest rates could be reduced in July. ""With the market's pricing of future inflation well anchored, early cracks emerging in the labor market and housing activity evidently weak, there are reasons for the Fed to consider adopting a dovish shift in the July FOMC meeting and guiding towards a cut in September ‚Äî a path already priced into the U.S. swaps market,"" Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone, said on X . Dovish hints could prompt more risk-taking in financial markets, boding well for BTC, which has held mainly above $100,000 throughout the recent escalation of conflict in the Middle East. Markets expect the Fed to deliver two 25 basis-point cuts this year, but the take is not unanimous/ ""We continue to think that clarity on the inflation story ‚Äî whether tariffs are a one-off price shock or if they prompt more sustained inflation pressures ‚Äî may not come before the December FOMC meeting, meaning we will see just one rate cut this year,"" analysts at ING said in a note to clients Friday. ""However, if the jobs market continues to weaken, that may well be a 50bp cut."" Core PCE On the data front, the core personal-consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, scheduled for release on Friday, is the marquee release. According to Pepperstone, the consensus is for the data to show a 0.1% month-on-month increase in May, resulting in an annualized growth rate of 2.6% and a three-month annualized rate of 1.6%. Expectations of a benign 0.1% increase support the Fed rate cut bets; however, according to ING, the inflationary impact of Trump's tariffs is expected to kick in from July. Trump's 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, announced in early April, is set to expire on July 9, following which the heavy 'Liberation Day' tariffs take effect. So far, the president has made a deal with the U.K. and announced a trade framework with China. Beijing is yet to sign the deal and the European Union remains quiet. Iran tensions are not over yet While the oil market is calm for now, Iran could inflict damage even without closing the Strait of Hormuz, a trade route that carries about a fifth of the world's oil. By constantly threatening the closure of the strait alone, Iran could push up shipping insurance costs, ultimately adding to oil prices. The cost to insure a vessel for the journey via the Strait of Hormuz has already risen from 20 cents a barrel to 80, a report by South China Morning Post said, quoting the Athens-based Xclusiv Shipbrokers. ""By planting enough belief that they could disrupt this key logistical channel, maritime costs could rise to the point that it would have a significant impact on the supply of crude and gas,"" Weston noted.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/23/focus-on-powell-s-testimony-u-s-core-pce-release-as-trump-s-tariff-deadline-looms,"ASIA|BTC|COMMODITY|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Powell|Markets|Inflation|US|Economy|News",cryptocompare
