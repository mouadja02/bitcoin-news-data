BTC, ETH, XRP, and Pi Network Bounce Back Strong appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After a nerve-wracking weekend packed with geopolitical tension and market dips, the crypto market is showing fresh signs of life. The crypto market’s turnaround comes after Bitcoin briefly dipped below $100,000 amid fears surrounding U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The Middle East conflict sent shockwaves across financial markets, but Bitcoin managed to hold key support levels and has since climbed back above $101,000. The overall crypto market is showing signs of recovery, with the total market cap climbing to $3.12 trillion — up 2.42% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin continues to lead the market, trading above $101,400 with a 5.7% gain over the past week. Ethereum follows with a solid 14.6% weekly rise, while altcoins like XRP, Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano are posting double-digit weekly gains. Hyperliquid (HYPE) surged over 22% this week, cementing its spot among the top performers. Despite the bounce, Altcoin Season Index remains low at 15/100 — suggesting Bitcoin dominance still rules this rally for now. One of the biggest confidence boosters for Bitcoin was news that MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor purchased a staggering $1 billion worth of BTC, adding to institutional optimism. This heavyweight buyout set off a chain reaction, with altcoins like ETH, XRP, ADA, DOT, and Pi Network all catching a bid. With geopolitical fears cooling slightly and options expiries out of the way, crypto markets are stabilizing for now. But with macro risks still looming and ETF developments on the radar, traders are advised to stay alert while enjoying this bounce.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-is-the-crypto-market-going-up-today-btc-eth-xrp-and-pi-network-bounce-back-strong/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|XRP","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news",cryptocompare

2025-06-23T15:48:09,"Middle East Crisis Hits Bitcoin: What Should We Expect Next for BTC? Fall or Rise? Analysts Comment!","Bitcoin price rose above $100,000 again in early May after a long correction. However, BTC fell below $100,000 for the first time since early May following the US-Iran developments over the weekend. While this decline is only temporary according to some analysts, according to others, the decline could deepen if critical levels are not maintained. At this point, experienced analyst 10x Research founder Markus Thielen said that Bitcoin's fall or rise depends on some levels. Explaining the critical levels for Bitcoin, the analyst said that as long as BTC remains above the short-term realized price of $98,000 and the trend support of $102,000, there is a chance for an increase and investors can continue to look for tactical bullish opportunities. However, the analyst warned investors against this situation and stated that a break below this range is very likely, especially in the absence of strong bullish catalysts. Stating that investors should manage their risks, the analyst said: “BTC has made three failed attempts to break above $110,000 due to short-term macroeconomic shocks, from tariff concerns in May to the escalation between Israel and Iran in June. At this point, Bitcoin has been in a consolidation phase for the last five weeks, and these events show that it is not behaving as a hedge in the current environment.” Stating that Bitcoin is too risky, Thielen said that the consolidation could last a few more months and said, “Our view is that we will consolidate throughout the summer.” Bitcoin's Uptrend Continues! While Thielen is not bullish on Bitcoin, Eugene Cheung, director of digital asset platform OSL, noted that despite Bitcoin briefly falling below $100,000, its resistance points to strong institutional support. “Even though Bitcoin has fallen below $100,000 due to increased geopolitical tensions following the US strike on Iran, it has remained resilient. This indicates strong institutional support and long-term optimism,” Cheung said, remaining bullish. Finally, LVRG Research analyst Nick Ruck argued that altcoins could outperform Bitcoin in the coming months. Ruck said that if macro conditions stabilize, catalysts for crypto could emerge and altcoins could outperform. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-23T15:46:00,"Expert Says Bitcoin Pattern Is Clear, Predicts BTC Will Fill This CME Gap Before Rally to $175,000","A top market analyst has identified a recurring pattern of uptrend on the Bitcoin chart, sharing what’s next before a rally to a new ATH. Expert EGRAG Crypto shared Bitcoin’s clear pattern in a Monday tweet , as BTC continues to hold above $100,000. After a steep decline to $98,330, the leading cryptocurrency quickly rebounded by 2.76% to close at $101,049 on Sunday, continuing its recovery today.Bitcoin Shows Clear Growth PatternMeanwhile, EGRAG identified that Bitcoin has maintained a clear pattern of growth this cycle. Recall that BTC has been one of the standout cryptocurrencies during this bull market, outperforming most altcoins so far.The analyst shared that Bitcoin’s growth strategy includes a corrective phase where it drops below its bull market support band (BMSB), followed by a major rally to reclaim and trade above the BMSB, and then a slight correction.A first bounce follows the first retest, with another consolidation before the second bounce. After the second bounce, Bitcoin enters another corrective phase and repeats the same pattern.Interestingly, EGRAG identified two points where Bitcoin followed this pattern to the letter, as shown in an accompanying chart. Bitcoin Analysis | EGRAG Crypto For instance, Bitcoin fell into a correction in November 2022, dropping to $15,500 and slipping below the BMSB , a signal based on the 20-week SMA and 21-week EMA. It recovered in January 2023, climbing to $28,600. A bounce followed in early March after a weekly doji candle, pushing the price to $31,000. Another doji in mid-June sparked a second bounce to $31,830, before Bitcoin pulled back again into a new correction.Meanwhile, another complete pattern occurred between September 2023 and June 2024 before the current formation.What's Next for Bitcoin as Pattern FormsEGRAG’s chart shows that Bitcoin is currently developing in alignment with the pattern, breaking from a corrective phase in late April to bring prices above the BMSB and to its current all-time high of $112,000. Now, Bitcoin is in the first retest phase, which has seen it correct 8.6% from its May peak price.From here, the analyst predicts that Bitcoin would retrace further to fill a CME gap at $91,950. Following the 10% correction from the current market price, Bitcoin would rally extensively to a new all-time high between $140,000 and $160,000.Subsequently, BTC would enter the second retest phase before launching to its ultimate target of $175,000 this cycle. From the current price of $102,319, this represents a 71% uptick.Remarkably, EGRAG has persisted in his expectation that Bitcoin will target $175,000 , sharing in an earlier analysis that this would happen by September 2025. Meanwhile, targets of $200,000 and $250,000 still exist for the largest cryptocurrency by market cap.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/23/expert-says-bitcoin-pattern-is-clear-predicts-btc-will-fill-this-cme-gap-before-rally-to-175000/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=expert-says-bitcoin-pattern-is-clear-predicts-btc-will-fill-this-cme-gap-before-rally-to-175000,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Market|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare
2025-06-23T15:45:20,"Analyst Says $1.30 Could be a Trap, And Not a Bounce Zone","Analyst warns of a key XRP price zone acting as a trap due to weak structure and liquidity targets. As of today, XRP trades at $2.02, marking a 2.65% decline in the last 24 hours and an 8.35% drop over the past seven days. Yet, an analyst warns that the broader setup may point to deeper structural weakness rather than a reversal.Analyst Flags Technical Weakness on XRP ChartA market analyst, Arthur, emphasized several structural concerns surrounding XRP’s recent price behavior. Despite optimism from some traders who viewed the move above the long-term downtrend as a breakout and a journey to a new all-time high, the analyst argued that the current formation lacks a solid technical base. https://twitter.com/XrpArthur/status/1936704462669680738According to this view, the $1.30 level, which previously acted as resistance ahead of XRP’s rally to $2.90 in December 2024, remains an important area of interest.Notably, the analyst identified $1.30 as a liquidity pool where the market could sweep late long positions before any genuine upward momentum returns. The analyst pointed to the absence of confirmation in the current move, noting that market makers tend to target such zones before allowing price to climb. Meanwhile, he identified a preferred re-entry point for a potential long position between $1.05 and $1.10, an area that could offer cleaner structural support.The analyst cautioned traders to mentally prepare for a potential drop, even if it doesn’t materialize, emphasizing a strategy focused on areas of maximum pain rather than following crowd-driven moves. According to him, he prefers targeting deeper price zones where others are less likely to act.Broader Macro Conditions Weigh on SentimentBeyond technical factors, the analyst also cited macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns as contributing to a bearish outlook. He mentioned uncertainties stemming from ongoing conflicts—including tensions between Iran and Israel, and the Russia–Ukraine war—as key risks. Additionally, he highlighted delays in regulatory clarity and the unresolved status of the Ripple case as deterrents for institutional capital inflows.Furthermore, he noted that summer market conditions boast historically low liquidity, making them more susceptible to manipulation. He listed these seasonal patterns alongside frozen ETF flows and overall market hesitancy among the reasons for traders to approach current XRP levels with caution.Teucrium CEO Highlights Long-Term Use Case for XRPDespite prevailing caution, Sal Gilbertie, CEO of Teucrium, pointed to continued demand for XRP-linked investment vehicles. During a recent interview, Sal Gilbertie highlighted increasing interest in investment products tied to XRP. He observed that several market participants believe XRP holds the potential to deliver stronger long-term returns than Bitcoin.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/23/analyst-says-1-30-could-be-a-trap-and-not-a-bounce-zone/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=analyst-says-1-30-could-be-a-trap-and-not-a-bounce-zone,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction",cryptocompare

2025-06-23T15:40:16,"Crypto Shock: Iran Strike Wipes Out $700M, Bitcoin Slides Below $100K","US airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities over the weekend sparked a sharp selloff in the crypto market, sending Bitcoin below the $100,000 mark for the first time in two months. The sudden geopolitical shock triggered roughly $700 million in liquidations, primarily affecting long positions, as traders rushed to cut losses amid increased uncertainty. $700 million in liquidations shake the market Data from major exchanges shows that over 172,000 traders were liquidated following the Iran strike, with total losses estimated at $681.8 million. Bitcoin-related liquidations accounted for around $151 million, while Ethereum traders faced even larger losses, nearing $282 million. The selloff pushed Bitcoin to lows near $98,500 before it stabilized just below $100,000 and started growing again. Other crypto assets, including SOL, XRP, and DOGE also took the hit, losing over $22 million combined. Here you can check recent market developments on Coinglass' liquidation heatmap. Iran strike vs past geopolitical shocks Bitcoin’s reaction to geopolitical risk is not unprecedented. October’s Iran–Israel exchange wiped out about $495 million in crypto longs and shorts, sending the BTC price below $62K. In March 2022, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered just over $242 million in crypto liquidations, as BTC tumbled from $45,000 to $35,000 in several days. However, after the markets absorbed the news, the number one cryptocurrency rebounded 65% within two months. These patterns both highlight Bitcoin’s volatility to global uncertainty and emphasize its long-term resilience to shocks. Do geopolitical turmoils provide investment opportunities? The current geopolitical turmoil coincides with ongoing regulatory developments, including the SEC’s recent policy roadmap and increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin ETFs. These factors add complexity to the market outlook as investors balance risk with opportunities. The Iran strike has clearly demonstrated how geopolitical risk can rapidly impact crypto markets, triggering large-scale liquidations and a BTC price crash. However, historical trends and on-chain signals suggest that Bitcoin’s drops below $100,000 may offer a strategic entry point for long-term investors. Still, opportunities are short-lived.

2025-06-23T15:39:09,"Analysts Split Between $92K Dip and $135K Surge for Bitcoin","CryptoQuant warns of a $92K flush while volume metrics hint at a summer blast-off to $135K, leaving traders scratching their heads. What Do the Odds Show? After setting a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,814 a month ago on May 22, Bitcoin experienced a pullback with the top cryptocurrency presently experiencing a consolidation. At the time of this writing, BTC was trading at $103,498 per CoinGecko data . As a result, analysts are torn between painting a bullish or bearish picture as Bitcoin’s compression intensifies. Market analyst Daan Crypto Trades opined, “ BTC Still hanging around the $105K area which is the middle of the monthly range and right at the monthly open. Price has been compressing and it's clear that the market is waiting for a big move to occur.” Based on this analysis, Bitcoin’s destination might be at its monthly high of $110K or monthly low of $100K. If Bitcoin breaks down from the current range, on-chain metrics provider CryptoQuant speculates the leading cryptocurrency might nosedive to the $92K. What are the Chances of Bitcoin Making a Comeback? Crypto analyst Lingrid believes that Bitcoin might be experiencing the calm before the storm with the target being $112K. She noted, “BTC has printed three consecutive triangle continuation patterns with each breakout sending price higher into the $112K–$114K resistance zone. Now consolidating again within a descending wedge, the pair is testing the lower support band with potential for one more sweep. A rebound from this area may set up a textbook push into the same target zone. If structure holds, the breakout could be stronger than the last.” Similar sentiments were shared by Cas Abbe that on-chain metrics were showing a breakout to the upside. The market analyst stated, “ BTC price is consolidating, but On-Balance Volume (OBV) is still making higher highs. For those who don't know, rising OBV indicates buying pressure.If OBV continues to go up, BTC will eventually break out of its consolidation range. I'm still convinced that $130K-$135K BTC will happen in Q3 2025.” The OBV indicator is a technical analysis tool that measures buying and selling pressure as a cumulative indicator based on volume flow. Therefore, OBV helps confirm price trends because if the price is rising and OBV is rising, the trend is likely strong and supported by volume. This shows that a bullish picture is being painted in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Meanwhile, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continue experiencing an uptick, given that they recently witnessed strong inflows of $388.3 million despite the ongoing geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran. Will the Slashing of Interest Rates Reignite Bitcoin’s Fire? Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller recently signaled a possible interest rate cut as soon as next month, citing a cooling economy and downplaying the inflationary impact of new tariffs as minimal and short-lived. He stated , “I think we’ve got room to bring it down, and then we can kind of see what happens with inflation. We’ve been on pause for six months to wait and see, and so far the data has been fine.” Here’s why slashing interest rates is increasingly seen as a bullish signal for Bitcoin: 1. Lower Rates Diminish Bond Appeal, Drive Risk Appetite Historic Fed rate cuts reduce fixed-income yields, pushing investors toward riskier assets. As Meltem Demirors from CoinShares notes , “when real interest rates decline, [Bitcoin’s] appeal grows” The June 18 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) held rates at 4.25–4.50%, yet projections shifted toward two cuts later in 2025. That pivot has lifted sentiment in crypto markets. 2. On‑Chain Indicators Point to Bullish Setups On‑chain data from CryptoQuant suggests stabilizing open interest and accumulating ask‑liquidity near $106K—signs of a potential short squeeze. Meanwhile, technicals remain constructive: Bitcoin continues respecting support at ~$103K–105K, with upside targets between $112K–118K, should bulls defend those levels. 3. Institutional Tailwinds Compound Macro Stimulus A dovish Fed enhances the case for Bitcoin adoption among institutions. Analysts from JPMorgan, CMC Markets, and CryptoQuant argue earlier-than-expected cuts could trigger another rally toward $112K–140K As major public firms and sovereign players continue accumulating Bitcoin, easier monetary policy amplifies their conviction. 4. Historical Precedent Confirms the Pattern Historically, Fed easing has coincided with crypto bull runs. For example, in September 2024, Bitcoin jumped ~2.5% ahead of anticipated cuts. Similar behavior is emerging in 2025: cooler inflation data, supportive Fed commentary, and easing expectations have fueled BTC’s break from the $105K range. Conclusion If the Federal Reserve begins cutting rates potentially starting in July 2025, there is a high likelihood that Bitcoin will surge. With macro conditions aligning, such as inflation cooling and institutional adoption rising, cumulative tailwinds may carry BTC toward $112K–140K in the months ahead. Nevertheless, the diverging on-chain signals should not be ignored based on the $92K dip warning, as well as the $135K breakout because Bitcoin currently finds itself in a ranging market.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9669/analysts-split-between-92-k-dip-and-135-k-surge-for-bitcoin,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

He also said the company will be a publicly traded entity on Nasdaq at the conclusion of the proposed merger. The ticker for the firm on the stock exchange right now is CCCM. Pompliano raises funds through equity and convertible notes Today I am announcing a $1 BILLION merger to create ProCap Financial, a bitcoin-native financial services. The company will be a publicly traded entity on Nasdaq at the conclusion of the proposed business combination between my private company ProCap BTC, LLC and Columbus Circle… — Anthony Pompliano 🌪 (@APompliano) June 23, 2025 American investor and entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano stated that he has raised over $750 million for the initiative, the largest initial fundraising for a publicly traded Bitcoin treasury company. He revealed in the proposed deal that ProCap raised $516.5 million in equity, and ProCap Financial secured commitments for $235 million in convertible notes. According to the report, the entities intend for the convertible notes to have an associated 144A CUSIP number on the issue date. They believe the number will facilitate potential post-closing trading amongst QUBIS, but are not expected to be registered or tradeable. Columbus Circle Capital Corp noted that the convertible notes have a 130% conversion rate, a zero interest rate, and a maturity of up to 36 months. The firm said the convertible notes will be 2x collateralized by cash, cash equivalents, or a portion of the BTC purchased with the proceeds from the merger. U.S. Bank National Trust will serve as collateral agent and trustee for the convertible notes and other associated guarantee arrangements. Pompliano also highlighted that ProCap BTC agreed to purchase BTC using the funds raised in the Preferred Equity Raise within fifteen days of signing the agreements. He added that the BTC assets will be held in a custodial account until the completion of the deal, providing future shareholders of ProCap Financial with immediate exposure to Bitcoin rather than waiting until after the closing. “We are fortunate to have raised this capital from some of the leading institutional investors on Wall Street, along with many of the top crypto investors globally. ProCap Financial represents our solution to the increasing demand for bitcoin-native financial services among sophisticated investors.” – Anthony Pompliano , U.S. investor. According to the report, leading investors participating in the deal include Magnetar Capital, Woodline Partners LP, Anson Funds, RK Capital, Off the Chain Capital, Parafi, Blockchain.com, Arrington Capital, BSQ Capital Partners, and FalconX. He also acknowledged that industry veterans such as Mark Yusko, Jason Williams, Eric Semler, Tony Guoga, and Mattei Franceschetti participated as well. Pompliano said ProCap Financial will focus on acquiring BTC for its balance sheet. He also said it will develop products and services to generate revenue and profit from Bitcoin on the firm’s balance sheet. CEO of CCCM, Gary Quin, mentioned that Antony’s track record as an innovative investor, operator, and early advocate in the Bitcoin ecosystem drew him to the partnership. He said the firm believes in Pompliano’s deep expertise and hopes his relentless conviction will help continue transforming the crypto industry. Shareholders receive newly issued shares of ProCap Financial ProCap BTC revealed that former security holders of CCCM and former unitholders of ProCap BTC will receive newly-issued securities of ProCap Financial as consideration in the business deal. According to the company, the number of ProCap Financial shares issuable to the holders at closing will depend on the value of the BTC measured as of a day shortly before the closing. The number of shares will also include holders who are investors in the equity raise. The company said the holders will receive ProCap shares representing 1.25 times the number of preferred units delivered to them upon consummation of the equity raise. Before the merger, the agreement was approved by the board of directors of CCCM and by the board of managers of ProCap BTC. The terms of the deal include the proposal and its terms getting approved by the requisite CCCM shareholders and by the sole voting unit holder of ProCap BTC, an entity owned and controlled by Pompliano. Pompliano said the merger is expected to be finalized before the end of 2025, after the submission for review by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission of a registration of Form S-4. The registration is to register applicable securities by ProCap Financial upon finalizing the proposed business combination.

Adding to the uncertainty is the lingering silence from Judge Analisa Torres on Ripple’s latest motion in its ongoing SEC lawsuit. The case, which could clear the path for U.S. institutional sales of XRP and possibly a spot ETF approval, remains unresolved. As XRP struggles to regain footing, the broader crypto market has also dipped, with altcoins suffering extra volatility thanks to legal headlines and geopolitical tensions. But amid the chaos, there’s one development that could quietly reshape XRP’s future. I spent much of the last week in the US with the Firelight team.

Philion hinted that after recent meetings in the U.S., this innovative solution is poised to bring billions of XRP into productive use on Flare’s ecosystem. XRP Price On Right Path? On-chain activity shows some resilience, with key wallets and escrow release schedules staying within expected ranges. Technical indicators also hint at a possible short-term bounce, with XRP’s RSI near oversold levels and key supports around $1.93 to $1.80 holding for now. Analyst Casi Trades said XRP is behaving just as expected. The price dropped close to a major support at $1.90, made a small bounce, and now looks set for a final dip to that level. This $1.90 mark is an important support zone and could signal a bottom if it holds and shows a bullish divergence. What’s even better is that Bitcoin is showing a similar pattern near $97,000.

The $100M TRON (TRX) PIPE deal and rebranding to 'Tron' turned SRM into a speculative proxy for the TRON blockchain. Valuing SRM is impossible with traditional metrics; the core business is worthless, and the TRON deal's real value is highly uncertain. This is an ultra-speculative play best avoided unless you have deep TRON knowledge—there's no rational fair value to anchor on right now. SRM Entertainment ( SRM ) has gone from a sub-$1 micro-cap facing a Nasdaq delisting notice to one of the hottest stocks over the past month. In fact, it's up an insane 2500% during this period. Let's unpack what it's all about, but know that this isn't your typical investment case. There's nothing fundamental here. It's all speculation and hype, so if you are looking for discounted cash flows or any form of ""value"", there's nothing here for you. SRM's Stock Price (Seeking Alpha) Who Is SRM Entertainment, Anyway? SRM Entertainment, based in Winter Park, Florida, has been in operation since 1981, quietly making souvenirs such as Mickey Mouse plushies and Universal Studios t-shirts for theme park giants like Walt Disney ( DIS ), Universal, Six Flags ( FUN ), and Merlin Entertainment. Its products are sold across the U.S., China, Japan, and Europe, and recently, SRM launched on Amazon, with sales reportedly spiking 400% in three months by December 2024. But don't get too eager. The numbers are well below those of your local mom-and-pop brick-and-mortar store. In Q1, SRM posted $1.09 million in revenue, a net loss of $646,586, and a grim EBITDA of negative $3.02 million. Cash on hand? A measly $895,930, barely covering liabilities of $828,046. SRM's Quarterly Revenues (Koyfin) No wonder the stock was going down the gutter if it weren't for a single press release that set shares on fire. The TRON Bombshell: A Crypto Curveball Last Monday, SRM dropped that very bombshell press release. A $100 million private investment in publi c equity ( PIPE ) deal funded entirely in TRON ( TRX-USD ) tokens, courtesy of an unnamed institutional investor, with Dominari Securities (a boutique investment bank linked to President Trump’s family) as the placement agent. The deal’s value is pegged to TRON’s closing price on June 15, and the tokens are locked in a custodian wallet controlled by SRM’s Board, with conversion limits pending shareholder approval. SRM also announced plans to rebrand as “Tron,” brought TRON founder Justin Sun on as an advisor, and unveiled a “TRON Treasury Strategy” to hoard TRX tokens and potentially pay dividends through a TRX staking program. So, in essence, SRM is morphing into a Nasdaq-listed proxy for TRON, a layer-1 blockchain with a $26 billion market cap, known for its high-throughput network optimized for decentralized applications and stablecoin settlements. The market has gone berserk since standing at $11.04 after Friday's closing bell. I have read through tons of comments online to see investors' reaction to the news and if there is any ""insight"" from those with deeper knowledge on the TRON network, so that I can get an idea of what the optimal scenario here is. Let me tell you, nobody has any idea what this is all about, or how it's going to play out. Even Bitcoin Treasury Companies, many of which I have covered lately, are much easier to understand what they are trying to achieve. But a ""Tron Company""? So naturally, many are treating this as meme stock on steroids while others are speculating about a crypto moonshot. Honestly, someone on X mistook SRM for a rare earth mining play, for reasons unknown, which I thought was funny. Valuing SRM Stock: Chasing a Crypto Unicorn So, how do you put a price on a case like SRM right now? Obviously, forget discounted cash flow models or P/E ratios. SRM’s negative earnings and tiny revenue make those irrelevant. This is a speculative bet, and I don't believe anyone has any idea how to value it. Clearly, the core toys business is worthless. Even if you value at 1x sales, and that's generous given it's losing money, the core business is worth like max $5 million. The real action is in the TRON deal. That $100 million in TRX tokens is a game-changer, boosting SRM’s cash reserves from under $1 million to a war chest that dwarfs its current operations. Investors might be looking at this as a balance sheet story. If SRM can convert those tokens to cash (without tanking TRX’s price) or use them strategically, it could unlock notable value. But some investors are valuing SRM as if that $100 million is already cash in the bank, justifying a market cap close to or above that figure. But then, at 17.24 million shares, $100 million translates to $5.80 per share, which is below the current price of $11.04, so already this looks like a bubble ready to burst. Now, the ""premium"" might be due to SRM’s rebranding as “Tron” and its treasury strategy, making it a backdoor play on TRON’s blockchain, which is pushing for dominance in cross-border stablecoin payments. Assuming they want to start accumulating TRX the same way Strategy ( MSTR ) accumulates BTC and achieve a ""Tron Yield"" the same way Bitcoin Treasury Companies try to generate BTC yield, then you can kind of justify a market cap premium for that ""future value"". MSTR, for instance, trades at a mNAV of 1.88 , in the same fashion, while smaller treasuries like The Smarter Web Company ( OTC:TSWCF ) trade at a mNAV of over 35 (since they just started their accumulation journey and can much faster produce ""BTC yield""). Final Thoughts Again, this is all speculative. This could 10x from here as investors get caught in some sort of ""First Tron Treasury"" company vibes before crushing, or crush as soon as next week, or actually lead to sustained gains, assuming whatever all parties involved in the deal actually know what they are doing and are able to leverage TRC to generate value. It's as speculative as it gets, and there is no way on Earth you can come even remotely close to a ""fair value,"" at least for now. So if you have some deeper knowledge tied to the Tron network and feel you can understand the mechanics of this trade, you are free to take a shot. But for the rest of us, I think it's safe to say SRM is to be avoided. And this is coming from someone who's a fan of BTC treasury companies and ""gets it"". A TRX treasury? I am not so sure about that.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4796560-srm-entertainment-single-month-2500-percent-rally-first-public-trx-treasury?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|TRX","SRM",cryptocompare

2025-06-23T15:19:18,"Bitcoin (BTC) Price Drops to $98,300: Weekend Selling Pressure Hits Hard","The Bitcoin (BTC) price was hit hard over the weekend as traders and investors were obliged to sell the only asset they could during a weekend of US bombing of Iranian nuclear installations and a threat from Iran to close the commercially critical strait of Hormuz. Bitcoin was all there was to sell Bitcoin’s superpower of being able to be traded 24/7 and over every weekend can sometimes be prejudicial to the king of the cryptocurrencies. As the US joined the Israeli strikes on Saturday by dropping “bunker busting” bombs and launching Tomahawk cruise missiles, scared investors began to sell the only liquid and tradeable asset in their portfolios, which was Bitcoin. Then on Sunday, the Iranian parliament voted to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical chokepoint for world trade. Bitcoin dropped further on the news. However, the final decision for whether to close the Strait rests with Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, which would have to bear in mind that closure of the Strait of Hormuz would risk alienating oil-rich neighbours and could lead to an 80% spike in oil prices. Bitcoin price rally After being heavily oversold on Saturday and Sunday, the Bitcoin price has rallied on Monday morning, up 3% and $3,000 from Sunday’s low of $98,300, to currently trade at around $101,400. It now remains to be seen whether this rally can continue, or whether further events in the Middle East can stunt Monday’s price rise. $BTC moves through descending trendline Source: TradingView The short-term time frame for $BTC illustrates the beginning of a recovery. The price has moved up through the downtrend and is in the process of confirming and consolidating above. In addition, the price is taking advantage of flipping the $101,000 resistance into support. If the recovery is able to continue, this will likely depend on how the U.S. stock market performs over the rest of Monday. So far, the S&P 500 is up around 0.3%, which bodes well for the $BTC price going forward. Stochastic RSI indicators cross-up on daily time frame Source: TradingView The daily time frame for $BTC shows the strong overhead resistance levels, first at $104,000, and then at $106,000. If the U.S. stock market continues to make light of the weekend conflict developments, the $BTC price could get to the first of these big resistances at $104,000. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI has just recorded a cross up of the blue fast line over the orange slow line. These indicator cross-overs on the daily have presaged some big moves in the past as can be seen in the chart above. Major concerns on weekly time frame Source: TradingView The weekly chart view for $BTC shows that the $104,000 support did not hold the price, and that it crashed through, eventually being held up by the strong support at $101,000. In order for the bulls to regain control, they will need to retake the $104,000 level and turn it back into support again. That said, the current support at $101,000 is going to have to hold firm. The bears will be exulting that not only did they manage to break the support, but they also caused the Stochastic RSI indicator lines to dip below the 80.00 level. This is critical, because if these indicator lines do not turn back up, there could be a long descent back down to the bottom, which is likely to drag the price down with it. This new week of price action could prove to be crucial. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The project had recently registered a price jump to $0.00018203. HINU’s next price increase will see the token’s value rise to $0.00018310. The project has raised $807,387 so far. Husky Inu (HINU) Registers Price Jump Husky Inu (HINU) has just logged the latest price increase of its pre-launch phase, rising from $0.00018203 to $0.00018256. The price jump is part of the project’s pre-launch phase, which officially began on April 1, immediately after the presale ended. The pre-launch phase is designed to empower the fledgling Husky Inu community and allow the project to continue its fundraising efforts as its launch date draws closer. The pre-launch phase is the next step in the project’s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. Husky Inu’s latest price jump comes at a time when bearish sentiment dominates the market thanks to the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Rising geopolitical tensions saw the crypto market crater over the weekend as sentiment worsened. Bitcoin (BTC) plunged below the psychologically important $100,000 mark and fell to a low of $98,385. However, it recovered from this level to reclaim $100,000 and end the weekend at $100,982. The flagship cryptocurrency has rebounded during the ongoing session and is trading around $101,720. Ethereum (ETH) also registered a substantial decline over the weekend, falling to a low of $2,135 before recovering and moving to its current level of $2,278. The broader crypto market has also recovered over the past 24 hours, with Ripple (XRP) up over 4% and Solana (SOL) up over 5%, trading around $135. Dogecoin (DOGE is up nearly 6%, while Cardano (ADA) is up almost 5%.

2025-06-23T15:10:32,"Long-Dormant Bitcoin Wallets Tighten Supply, Fueling Bullish Outlook","Interestingly, Bitcoin coins untouched for ten years now exceed daily issuance, reviving 2021-style supply-shock narratives as analysts float $200K cycle targets. Bitcoin’s 10-Year Hodling Narrative Goes Through the Roof Following the 2024 halving, a pivotal shift emerged in Bitcoin’s ecosystem. For the first time ever, more BTC is becoming “ancient supply”—unmoved for over 10 years—than is being newly mined. On average, 566 BTC per day goes dormant, outpacing the 450 BTC issued daily, according to Glassnode data. Fidelity acknowledged , “The strong conviction of these ultra long-term holders is having an increasing influence on the wider Bitcoin ecosystem.” On January 1, 2019, Satoshi Nakamoto became the first Bitcoin 10-year holder, and ever since, nearly 3.4 million BTC worth more than $360 billion has joined the “ancient supply” category. Fidelity noted that roughly one-third of the ancient Bitcoin supply belongs to Satoshi, while a significant portion is likely lost or inaccessible though some of these coins could still resurface. The rise in long-term holders may partly explain Bitcoin’s sideways and downward price action in Q1 2025. Despite ancient supply outpacing new issuance, this imbalance doesn’t guarantee price gains, but it could regnite hope that the leading cryptocurrency could soar to the $205K target in the long run, owing to a remarkable hodling trend and an imminent Bitcoin supply squeeze. The supply shock narrative is supported by the fact that BTC on exchanges recently hit a 7-year low , reflecting a shift in market structure and investor behavior. Institutional Grade Bitcoin Treasury Gains Steam Not only is ancient BTC taking over, but also corporate Bitcoin adoption as a treasury asset has been going through the roof in the first half of 2025, marking a pivotal shift toward institutional-grade crypto strategies. Several factors are making institutional-grade Bitcoin treasuries more viable and appealing than ever. A growing Wave of Corporate Treasuries As of early June 2025, roughly 80 publicly listed companies collectively hold over 673,000–688,000 BTC—valued at nearly $70 billion—amounting to around 3–3.4% of all circulating Bitcoin. Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, leads with 582,000 BTC , acquired for a total of $40.79 billion at an average price of about $70,086 per Bitcoin. Other adopters include Tesla, Block, GameStop, Trump Media, Metaplanet, Semler Scientific, and Twenty One Capital. Nakamoto Holdings is the latest firm to expand its BTC treasury through a PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity) worth a whopping $51.5 million. Why is this Trend Gaining Steam Inflation hedge & dollar uncertainty Corporate leaders cite concerns over a weakening U.S. dollar, rising global debt, and unpredictable monetary policy. Bitcoin offers both a fixed-supply hedge and non-sovereign diversification. Regulatory tailwinds Under the current U.S. administration, firms like Trump Media are leveraging a more crypto‑friendly regulatory environment, with streamlined access to debt markets via convertible bonds designed to fund BTC buys . Tactical capital raising Public companies are issuing bonds, convertible notes, and equity to finance BTC accumulation—mirroring Strategy’s leveraged approach. For example, KindyMD is merging with Nakamoto Holdings with $763 million in escrow for Bitcoin reserves. Market psychology & optics Bitcoin treasury announcements often spark sharp runs in corporate stock prices—even for non-crypto firms. GameStop saw its price jump following its BTC purchase. Conclusion As more companies follow Strategy’s model—supported by IPOs, mergers, and debt financings—the Bitcoin treasury play is gaining legitimacy and momentum.

2025-06-23T15:00:54,"URGENT: Israel Iran Conflict Escalates, Raising Geopolitical Risk and Crypto Market Concern","BitcoinWorld URGENT: Israel Iran Conflict Escalates, Raising Geopolitical Risk and Crypto Market Concern In the ever-watchful world of global events, developments far beyond the traditional financial sector can send ripples through unexpected markets, including cryptocurrency. A recent report indicates a significant escalation in Middle Eastern tensions, specifically concerning the Israel Iran conflict . This development, if confirmed and persistent, is a crucial piece of news that investors in digital assets should monitor closely, as geopolitical instability often correlates with increased market volatility. What Happened at the Fordow Nuclear Facility? According to reports citing Tasnim News Agency and shared via @PiQSuite on X, Israel has reportedly resumed attacks on Iran’s Fordow nuclear facility . This facility is particularly sensitive due to its location deep underground, making it difficult to target, and its role in Iran’s uranium enrichment program. Key points regarding the Fordow facility and the reported attack: Location: The Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant (FFEP) is built inside a mountain near Qom, providing significant protection from aerial bombardment. Purpose: It is one of Iran’s primary sites for enriching uranium. Significance: Any military action against such a facility is seen as a direct attempt to impede Iran’s nuclear capabilities and is a major escalation point in regional tensions. Reporting Source: The information originates from Tasnim News Agency, an Iranian source, as reported by @PiQSuite. Independent verification of military actions in such sensitive areas can be challenging in the immediate aftermath. This reported resumption of attacks signals a potential intensification of the long-standing shadow war and open hostilities between Israel and Iran. Why Does Geopolitical Risk Matter for Crypto? While cryptocurrency markets were initially conceived as independent of traditional finance and sovereign actions, their increasing integration into the global economy means they are not immune to macro-economic and geopolitical risk . Significant international conflicts or escalations can trigger broad market reactions. Here’s why geopolitical risk is relevant: Investor Sentiment: Uncertainty and fear driven by conflict can lead investors across all asset classes to reduce risk exposure, selling volatile assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. Economic Stability: Major conflicts can disrupt global trade, energy supplies, and economic growth forecasts, creating a challenging environment for investment. Policy Responses: Governments may implement new policies, sanctions, or regulations in response to geopolitical events, some of which could indirectly or directly impact the crypto ecosystem (e.g., restrictions on certain transactions, focus on tracking illicit flows). Correlation with Traditional Markets: As crypto has matured, its correlation with traditional indices like the S&P 500 has often increased. If geopolitical events cause a downturn in traditional markets, crypto often follows. Understanding the potential for geopolitical risk is therefore a critical part of navigating the volatile crypto landscape. Assessing the Potential Crypto Market Impact An escalation in the Israel Iran conflict and actions against sensitive sites like the Fordow nuclear facility can have a noticeable crypto market impact . Historically, major global shocks have led to initial sell-offs in risk assets, followed by varied reactions depending on the nature of the crisis and the prevailing market sentiment. Potential impacts on the crypto market could include: Increased Volatility: Expect larger price swings as the market reacts to news and uncertainty. Risk-Off Sentiment: Investors might move funds out of perceived riskier assets like altcoins and potentially even Bitcoin into more stable holdings (though defining ‘stable’ in a crisis is complex). Narrative Shifts: Debates around Bitcoin’s status as a ‘digital gold’ or safe haven asset during times of conflict may resurface, potentially influencing its price trajectory differently than other crypto assets. Liquidity Changes: Market liquidity can decrease during periods of high uncertainty, potentially amplifying price movements. The extent of the crypto market impact will depend heavily on the duration and severity of the reported conflict escalation and how it is perceived by the broader global financial system. What Could This Mean for Bitcoin Price? As the largest and most established cryptocurrency, the Bitcoin price is often seen as a bellwether for the broader crypto market. Its reaction to escalating geopolitical tensions is a subject of ongoing debate. Arguments regarding Bitcoin’s reaction: Argument Explanation Potential Impact on Bitcoin Price Risk Asset Correlation Bitcoin often trades like a tech stock or growth asset, correlating with indices like the Nasdaq. Geopolitical fear often hurts these assets first. Negative: Price could fall alongside traditional markets. Digital Gold / Safe Haven In times of fiat currency instability or geopolitical uncertainty, some argue Bitcoin’s decentralized nature makes it a store of value similar to gold. Positive: Price could rise as investors seek alternatives to traditional assets/currencies. Liquidity & Accessibility Bitcoin is globally accessible 24/7, potentially making it easier to move value across borders during a crisis compared to traditional banking channels. Positive: Increased demand from those in affected regions or seeking to move capital. In the immediate term, initial reactions to sudden negative geopolitical news tend to favor the ‘risk asset’ narrative, potentially putting downward pressure on the Bitcoin price . However, sustained conflict or economic fallout could potentially strengthen the ‘digital gold’ narrative over time, depending on how traditional safe havens like gold and the US dollar perform. Navigating Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the potential for the Israel Iran conflict and actions like the reported attack on the Fordow nuclear facility to increase geopolitical risk and affect the crypto market impact , including the Bitcoin price , what steps can crypto investors consider? Stay Informed: Monitor reliable news sources for updates on the geopolitical situation and its potential wider implications. Be wary of unverified reports, especially regarding military actions. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Geopolitical events add another layer of uncertainty. Re-evaluate if your current portfolio allocation aligns with your comfort level for risk. Diversification: Ensure your portfolio is diversified, not just within crypto but across different asset classes if possible, to mitigate risks associated with any single market’s reaction. Long-Term Perspective: Avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term news spikes. Consider your long-term investment strategy. Risk Management: Use tools like stop-loss orders if you are actively trading to limit potential downside exposure during periods of high volatility. While no one can predict market movements with certainty, being prepared and understanding the potential impacts of global events is key to navigating volatile periods. Conclusion: Monitoring Global Tensions and Crypto’s Response The reported resumption of attacks on Iran’s Fordow nuclear facility by Israel is a serious development in the long-running Israel Iran conflict . Such escalations significantly raise the level of geopolitical risk on a global scale. For cryptocurrency investors, this isn’t just a distant political issue; it has the potential for a tangible crypto market impact , influencing everything from overall market sentiment to the specific trajectory of the Bitcoin price . As the situation unfolds, monitoring reliable news sources and understanding the interconnectedness of global events and financial markets will be crucial. While the immediate reaction might lean towards risk aversion, the long-term implications for crypto, particularly Bitcoin’s role in a world facing increased uncertainty, remain a key area of focus for investors.

I, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). The firm was founded by investor and crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano, who confirmed raising over $750 million in funding, including $235 million through convertible debt. The remaining capital was secured through equity financing. Unlike several other companies still navigating regulatory hurdles, ProCap says it is ready to begin purchasing bitcoin immediately. The company intends to eventually hold up to $1 billion worth of bitcoin on its balance sheet. At the same time, it is building a suite of financial services that includes lending, trading, and capital markets. Several companies are pursuing bitcoin-focused strategies aimed at stock market investors, such as Trump Media’s $2.5 billion reserve plan. This trend mirrors the model adopted by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which used public company status to build a bitcoin treasury. However, ProCap says its approach involves creating a broader business model by offering bitcoin-denominated financial services in addition to holding the asset. According to Pompliano, the goal is to construct a full-service financial platform that mirrors traditional Wall Street institutions but is built entirely on bitcoin rather than fiat currency. The company’s backers will have immediate exposure to bitcoin. In a statement to CNBC, Pompliano explained, “Many companies don’t care about the cost of capital. We do.

Cardone described the strategy as fusing ”the two best-in-class assets” by combining income-producing real estate with Bitcoin’s long-term upside. The firm also plans to acquire an additional 3,000 BTC by year’s end. This move places Cardone Capital ahead of several major mining firms in BTC holdings and follows the launch of its dual-asset 10X Miami River Bitcoin Fund in May. Meanwhile, Japanese firm Metaplanet is closing in on Tesla’s BTC stash, with its latest 1,111 BTC purchase bringing total holdings to 11,111.

The billionaire entrepreneur described the move as the integration of “the two best-in-class assets,” combining real estate and Bitcoin in a novel investment strategy. Cardone also disclosed plans to increase the firm’s Bitcoin holdings by an additional 3,000 BTC before the end of the year. This acquisition places Cardone Capital ahead of well-known Bitcoin mining firms Core Scientific and Cipher Mining in terms of Bitcoin treasury size, according to blockchain analytics platform BiTBO . Cardone Capital isa private equity real estate firm that was founded in 2017, and it manages over 14,000 multifamily residential units. It also has more than $5.1 billion in assets under management. Known for pooling investor capital to acquire large-scale real estate assets, the firm is now aiming to fuse traditional property investments with digital currency exposure. In May, Cardone Capital launched the 10X Miami River Bitcoin Fund , which is a dual-asset investment vehicle comprising a 346-unit multifamily property in Miami and a $15 million Bitcoin allocation. Grant Cardone explained that the idea stemmed from a conversation with his brother, who suggested creating a fund that uses real estate cash flow to buy Bitcoin—effectively compounding long-term value across both asset classes. BTC vs Real Estate Growth Projections (Source: Cardone Capital ) As more firms begin to adopt Bitcoin treasury strategies, the line between traditional asset classes and digital currencies is beginning to blur,and it is reshaping corporate finance models across many industries. Metaplanet Closes in on Tesla’s BTC Holdings Japanese investment firm Metaplanet also continued its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy, and announced the purchase of an additional 1,111 BTC on June 23. The latest buy brings the company’s total holdings to 11,111 Bitcoin. This narrows the gap with Tesla, which currently holds 11,509 BTC. According to a regulatory filing , Metaplanet spent approximately 17.26 billion yen, or $117 million, for the new purchase, paying just under $105,500 per coin. Despite Bitcoin trading around $102,000 at the time, Metaplanet's overall average cost basis is still favorable at $95,560 per Bitcoin. This new purchase happened just a week after Metaplanet added 1,112 BTC to its treasury, which pushed its holdings past 10,000 BTC for the first time. Earlier in the month, the company briefly lost its spot as the eighth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder when Hut 8 upped its stash, but Metaplanet has since reclaimed its ranking. Now trailing Tesla by fewer than 400 coins, Metaplanet could soon leapfrog the electric vehicle giant if it maintains its current pace. The next milestone after that would be CleanSpark, which currently holds 12,502 BTC. Metaplanet’s aggressive moves come amid a broader surge in corporate interest in Bitcoin treasuries. Nakamoto Holdings recently raised $51.5 million to expand its BTC reserves, while Parataxis Holdings launched a Bitcoin-native treasury platform in South Korea. Norwegian crypto firm K33 announced plans to raise $8.9 million to purchase up to 1,000 BTC, and the Norwegian Block Exchange experienced a stock surge of over 138% after revealing its own Bitcoin treasury strategy. France’s Blockchain Group also joined the growing list by acquiring 182 BTC to bring its holdings to 1,653. Bitcoin holdings (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) The corporate Bitcoin treasury trend appears to be accelerating rapidly, with more than 240 public companies now holding a combined 832,000 BTC. This accounts for almost 4% of the total 21 million Bitcoin supply. Saylor’s Strategy Buys More BTC Michael Saylor’s Strategy, the world’s largest public holder of Bitcoin, also recently added 245 BTC to its growing treasury during the broader market dip that was triggered by geopolitical tensions. The company disclosed in a Monday filing with the SEC that it spent $26 million on the purchase, paying an average of $105,856 per coin. This acquisition took place during a volatile week for Bitcoin , which fell from around $108,900 on June 16 to an intraweek low just under $99,000. BTC’s price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) While this is one of Strategy’s smaller Bitcoin purchases over the past few months—and its smallest since March’s 130 BTC buy for $10.7 million—the timing raised some questions. Some critics noticed that the company once again appeared to have bought relatively few coins during a rare price pullback. This conservative move contrasts with its more aggressive buys, like the recent $1 billion purchase earlier in June. However, the pattern aligns with Saylor’s well-known accumulation philosophy, which he’s described as “buying the top forever.” In late 2024, Saylor famously declared his intention to buy Bitcoin even at $1 million per coin, which means that he could potentially spend as much as $1 billion a day at such price levels. Despite the volatility, Strategy’s latest purchase increased its total holdings to 592,345 BTC, which was acquired at an average cost of $70,681 per coin, totaling around $41.9 billion in historical investment. With Bitcoin now trading close to $102,000, the company’s year-to-date BTC yield stands at 19.2%. This figure is a slight increase from the 19.19% yield that was reported during the $1 billion buy earlier in the month. Strategy has raised its yield target to 25% for the year, up from an earlier 15% goal set in May, reflecting growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Strategy’s Bitcoin metrics (Source: Strategy ) The new buy also happened just days after Saylor raised eyebrows with his most ambitious forecast yet. He predicted that Bitcoin could reach a price of $21 million within 21 years. The move proves that Strategy is fully committed to BTC, even during periods of short-term market uncertainty.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9665/cardone-and-metaplanet-add-btc-to-corporate-treasuries,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|ZRX","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-06-23T14:55:12,"$4M Coinbase Scam Ends in Designer Splurge and Casino Blowout","Crypto scams have become more frequent and more sophisticated as the industry grows. Billions of dollars have been taken by malicious actors targeting crypto users, and even those with a technical background have failed to avoid them. Coinbase Scams Affects Elderly Victims Top investigator ZachXBT unveiled a scam allegedly conducted by Christian ‘DayTwo’ Nieves. According to the investigation, the bad actor stole over $4 million from Coinbase users by impersonating a customer support representative for the crypto exchange. As seen on the image below, and as per the investigation, the perpetrator used the stolen funds to buy luxury items. ZachXBT claims that most of the stolen funds were lost while gambling at online casinos. The investigator explained the Modus Operandi used by DayTwo to conduct the scam. As per the findings, the bad actor operated a call center where he also worked as a caller, later he convinced crypto users to install and set up a Coinbase wallet. These wallet’s private keys were compromised, allowing the group to move and withdraw funds without the owners’ authorization. In order to verify the malicious activities conducted by Daytwo and his associates, ZachXBT tracked a $240,000 transaction stolen from an elderly victim. As seen in the video, recorded in November 2024, $240,000 were directly linked to the wallet involved in the scam. A portion of the stolen assets were converted to Monero (XMR) and deposited into an online casino, Roobet. 5/ Daytwo likes to gamble on Discord calls with friends. The recording below shows his Roobet username ‘pawsonhips’ where he leaks his deposit address in a browser tab. 0x940970549037634c517deb741b16112b52e0ced1 pic.twitter.com/i38XVbocUu — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) June 23, 2025 Stolen Funds Lost in Crypto Gambling ZachXBT also claims that it was usual for DayTwo to gamble with his friends while streaming on Discord. In one of these sessions, DayTwo shows his user name for the online casino Roobet, ‘pawsonhips,’ accidentally leaking one of the addresses connected to the scams. The investigator stated: I traced out his casino deposit address which links onchain to 30+ suspected thefts. I expect there’s many additional victims I am unable to directly link. While there’s potentially overlap between multiple threat actors the vast majority of activity pertains to Daytwo. As DayTwo lost more and more funds on the online casino, and the proceeds from the scams declined, the less funds he deposited on Roobet. Moreover, the bad actor and his friends also openly discussed criminal activities on their Discord calls. ZachXBT added: It’s rare we see a social engineering scammer with such blatant disregard to mask their identity while flexing stolen funds all over social media. As Daytwo is not a minor it’s a rather easy case for law enforcement to pursue. Sadly any recovery for victims is likely a small amount given the funds were mostly gambled away after thefts.

2025-06-23T14:55:08,"BitMEX Former CEO Arthur Hayes Talks About Bitcoin (BTC)! ""The Sound of the Rise Has Been Heard, Here's Why!""","Although the US's involvement in the tensions between Israel and Iran caused a decline in Bitcoin and altcoins over the weekend, this decline was short-lived. While BTC rose above $100,000 again in the morning hours, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes, known for his bold statements, evaluated the recent decline. Accordingly, Arthur Hayes stated that the recent decline in Bitcoin and the markets was temporary and predicted that the price declines due to the tensions in the Middle East would not last long. Sharing from the X account, Hayes stated that more money will be printed and this will eventually benefit Bitcoin. At this point, Hayes argued that central banks are preparing to print more money in response to the current market weakness. According to the famous name, this will strengthen Bitcoin's position as a safe haven asset and enable BTC to prove its true value soon. “Do you hear it? … That’s the sound of money printers stepping up to do their patriotic duty. This weakness will pass and leave no doubt about BTC’s safe haven status.” Stating that he has been expecting an increase for Bitcoin and altcoins for a long time, Hayes expects BTC to rise to $150,000-200,000 by the summer of 2025 and to rise to $250,000 by the end of 2025.

2025-06-23T14:50:50,"Urgent Bitcoin Price Test: Geopolitics, Fed, and Liquidity Shape Crypto Market Future","BitcoinWorld Urgent Bitcoin Price Test: Geopolitics, Fed, and Liquidity Shape Crypto Market Future The world of cryptocurrency is buzzing with anticipation as the Bitcoin price navigates a complex landscape shaped by macroeconomic forces, geopolitical tensions, and shifting market dynamics. This week presents several crucial tests that could significantly impact the trajectory of the Bitcoin market and the broader crypto market . Understanding the Current Bitcoin Price Challenge The recent performance of the Bitcoin price has put key support levels under scrutiny. As Cointelegraph recently highlighted, a dip towards the $98,000 mark has traders and analysts closely monitoring the next potential floor. A significant concern is the decreasing market liquidity combined with increasing sell pressure. Should the $98,000 level fail to hold firmly, the next major support zone eyed by many is around $92,000. This level represents a critical point that could either stabilize the price or signal further downside potential in the immediate term. Monitoring these support levels is essential for anyone participating in the Bitcoin market . The interplay between buy and sell orders, coupled with overall market sentiment, dictates whether these levels can withstand pressure or buckle under it. Low liquidity can exacerbate price swings, making the current environment particularly volatile for the Bitcoin price . Geopolitics and the Crypto Market Global events, particularly geopolitical developments, can send ripples through financial markets, and the crypto market is no exception. The recent tensions in the Middle East involving Iran and Israel provided a stark reminder of this connection. While markets initially reacted to the escalating conflict, the response in the Bitcoin market appeared relatively contained. This suggests that while traders are aware of the potential for disruption, the current consensus among investors doesn’t seem to be pricing in a prolonged, large-scale war scenario that would significantly impact global economic stability over the long term. However, it’s crucial to remain vigilant. Unexpected escalations or new conflicts could quickly shift sentiment and introduce significant volatility. Geopolitical risk remains a factor that traders must consider when assessing the potential movements of the Bitcoin price and the broader crypto market . The U.S. Federal Reserve’s Influence on the Bitcoin Market Macroeconomic data from the United States continues to be a dominant force influencing asset prices globally, including the Bitcoin market . This week, the focus is sharply on key data releases from the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed). The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation data is particularly significant, as it is the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation. A higher-than-expected PCE reading could signal persistent inflationary pressures, potentially leading the Fed to maintain higher interest rates for longer or even consider future rate hikes. Conversely, a lower reading could increase optimism about potential rate cuts. Adding to this, Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s Congressional testimony is eagerly awaited. His comments could provide crucial insights into the Fed’s current thinking on inflation, economic growth, and the future path of monetary policy. Any hawkish or dovish signals from Powell could fuel significant macro volatility, directly impacting risk assets like Bitcoin. The market’s speculation around interest rates heavily influences investor appetite for higher-risk investments, making the Fed’s actions and communications a critical factor for the Bitcoin price . Is an Altcoin Season on the Horizon? While Bitcoin often captures the spotlight, the performance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin offers valuable clues about market cycles. Currently, Bitcoin dominance , a metric measuring Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the total crypto market cap, is nearing levels that have historically preceded a significant shift. These levels are often seen as potential reversal points, signaling a possible upcoming altcoin season . An altcoin season is a period where altcoins, collectively or individually, see significant price increases and outperform Bitcoin. The past year has largely been characterized by Bitcoin’s strength, especially leading up to and following the Bitcoin halving . However, if Bitcoin dominance starts to decline from these high levels, it could indicate that investor capital is rotating from Bitcoin into smaller cap altcoins in search of higher returns. Identifying the potential start of an altcoin season is a key strategy for many crypto traders looking to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on broader market movements beyond just the Bitcoin price . Beyond the Halving: Could Bitcoin Reach $200,000? Despite the immediate challenges and volatility, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains remarkably bullish for many analysts. Following the recent Bitcoin halving event, which reduced the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, historical precedent suggests that Bitcoin is entering a phase often associated with significant price appreciation. Analysts are projecting that BTC could potentially reach levels exceeding $200,000 in 2025. These projections are often based on the historical performance of Bitcoin following previous halvings and the cyclical nature of the Bitcoin market . The four-year cycle, largely influenced by the halving events, has historically shown a pattern of accumulation, parabolic rise, and subsequent correction. If this historical trend holds, the period following the 2024 Bitcoin halving could indeed pave the way for new all-time highs. While such price targets are speculative and subject to numerous factors, they highlight the underlying optimism and the potential for substantial growth in the Bitcoin market over the next couple of years, provided the market navigates the current macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds successfully. Summary: Navigating the Crossroads The Bitcoin price stands at a critical juncture, influenced by a confluence of factors. Immediate challenges include testing key support levels amidst liquidity concerns and the potential for volatility stemming from U.S. Fed data and geopolitical events. However, the longer-term outlook, supported by the historical impact of the Bitcoin halving and the potential for an altcoin season , remains compelling for many. Traders and investors must carefully weigh these short-term risks against the long-term potential as the Bitcoin market continues to evolve.

Key risks include an oil price surge, which could fuel inflation and delay Fed rate cuts. Investors are watching indicators like oil prices and the U.S. dollar to gauge the impact. U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have injected new uncertainty into global financial markets, creating significant macroeconomic risks that directly impact the cryptocurrency space. For crypto investors, the conflict has shifted the focus to key external factors, including the price of oil, potential delays in central bank rate cuts, and global risk sentiment. Understanding these new pressures is now critical to navigating the path forward for Bitcoin and the broader digital asset market.

2025-06-23T14:39:38,"Bitcoin Move to $96K or $106K Next? (BTC Price Analysis)","Bitcoin just broke below a multi-week consolidation range as things get even more heated in the Middle East. While the long-term trend remains bullish, short- to mid-term momentum is weakening as the market shows signs of lower highs and lower lows forming. By Shayan Bitcoin Price Analysis: Technicals The Daily Chart The daily timeframe paints a more concerning picture for buyers. BTC was stuck in a tightening range for several weeks, forming a descending triangle. This structure broke to the downside briefly with a wick, as the price aggressively tested the demand zone between $98K and $100K. This are had previously acted as a launchpad for the May rally. The reaction here has been sharp: BTC printed a long lower wick, indicating the presence of aggressive buyers. While follow-through remains limited, the daily candle closed back inside the pattern, suggesting that this behavior might just be a sell-side liquidity sweep. Moreover, the RSI on the daily has now dropped to the 40 level, hovering just above the oversold threshold. This isn’t yet bullish divergence, but it does show that momentum is no longer in the buyers’ favor. If the $98K–$100K zone fails to hold on a closing basis, BTC could quickly drop toward the next major support around 96K, which also aligns with the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, and the lower boundary of the large ascending channel. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart Zooming into the 4H timeframe, we can clearly see the breakdown structure and how BTC has been respecting bearish order flows. After the sell-side liquidity grab just below $100K, the price bounced sharply and filled the FVG that formed between 100K and $102K. This fair value gap is now acting as resistance, capping any bullish attempts to push higher. There are two FVGs now in play: the recent one just above 100K and the older one near $106K, which previously pushed the price lower. Unless BTC reclaims the recent high near the $103K mark with conviction, it’s more likely to revisit lower support levels than to retest the $106K area. Notably, the 4H RSI has bounced from oversold conditions (near 30) to the 40–45 range, indicating a short-term relief, but this is still far from a trend reversal. Market structure remains bearish with lower highs and lower lows being printed consistently since mid-June. In short, the 4H bias remains bearish below $103K, and price is currently trading inside a reaction zone. Bitcoin needs to break and close above this FVG for any potential reversal to gain momentum. Source: TradingView On-Chain Analysis Bitcoin Miners Position Index The onchain landscape provides a bit of relief for long-term holders. The latest reading of the Miners’ Position Index (MPI) shows that miner selling pressure is minimal. Historically, elevated MPI values (above 2) have preceded strong market corrections, as miners tend to offload large amounts of BTC into rallies. However, current MPI values remain well below 1, signaling that miners are holding their coins rather than selling them aggressively. This suggests that the recent drop is more likely driven by market structure, liquidity grabs, and short-term derivatives pressure, rather than long-term fundamental shifts. Combined with stable exchange reserves and growing accumulation wallets, the data leans neutral to slightly bullish from an onchain perspective.

2025-06-23T14:38:46,"Canaan to Exit AI Chip Business, Double Down on Bitcoin Mining Amid Realignment","Canaan Inc. (CAN), the Singapore-based manufacturer of bitcoin mining machines, will wind down its artificial intelligence (AI) semiconductor business to refocus on its core crypto operations. Despite the growing trend of bitcoin miners diversifying their revenue through AI-related businesses, building AI chips is likely very competitive and not cost-effective for smaller companies. Canaan said that its AI unit, which brought in just about $900,000 in revenue in 2024 (versus total revenue of $88.8 million) and accounted for 15% of company-wide operating expenses, failed to align with the firm's long-term strategy, the company said on Monday. “Doubling down on our core strengths in crypto infrastructure and bitcoin mining is the most strategic path forward,” CEO Nangeng Zhang said in the statement. Before the move, the company said it began exploring options for the AI unit as far back as March 2022, including selling it or shutting it down entirely. Now, Canaan expects to complete the phase-out in the coming months and anticipates a sharp drop in costs once the exit is finalized. Canaan is best known for its Avalon mining rigs, one of the earliest brands of ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) miners built for bitcoin. The firm went public on Nasdaq in 2019 and continues to develop mining hardware while also expanding into self-mining and consumer mining products. The decision, which comes after years of trying to diversify into edge computing chips, is hardly a surprise given the recent focus of miners and mining chip makers on "" American Made "" bitcoin after Trump's U.S. election win. Recently, Benchmark's Mark Palmer wrote in his research that rig maker's shares don't reflect upside potential from the expansion of the company's self-mining operations, especially in the United States. Canaan's shares were slightly down on Monday, while the broader digital assets and equities markets were mostly positive. The stock fell 71% this year, while a bitcoin mining ETF, WGMI, declined about 20%.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/06/23/canaan-to-exit-ai-chip-business-double-down-on-bitcoin-mining-amid-realignment,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|RESEARCH","Finance|Bitcoin Mining|Canaan|AI|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-23T14:38:05,"Wall Street is being flooded by a new generation of investors","Wall Street is being flooded by a new generation of investors who don’t trust the traditional system and are making it clear they’re not sticking with stocks and bonds. Millennials and Gen Z, mostly under 43 and holding real money, are steering their wealth into crypto, real estate, pre-IPO startups, collectibles, and other alternative assets. They’ve seen crashes, bailouts, and inflation destroy portfolios, and they’ve had enough. Their money is going where the old playbook doesn’t reach. According to Bloomberg, Bank of America has seen the number of its retail clients holding alternatives more than double since 2020. The bank adds around 50 new alternative funds every year. A large study by BofA last year showed that 73% of wealthy investors under 43 don’t believe a traditional stock-and-bond mix will make them rich. About 93% said they plan to pour more cash into alternatives going forward. Investment firms create retail versions of elite products The change is forcing big names to rebuild how they package investment products. Firms like Blackstone and Apollo are rolling out ETFs and semi-liquid funds that look retail-friendly but were once only for institutions. These funds are now available through private banks and fintech apps. Forge Global Holdings dropped the minimum investment threshold to $5,000, which led to a spike in daily signups. Many of the new users were chasing early access to companies like OpenAI, trying to grab a piece before any IPO. These new investors see the 60/40 portfolio as broken. That model, which used to split 60% into stocks and 40% into bonds, completely failed in 2022 when inflation pushed both assets down at the same time. Morgan Stanley recently filed to launch a fund that gives access to everything from private debt to real estate and infrastructure. A survey by CAIS revealed that 80% of alternative managers are planning to launch retail products, nearly double the figure from three years ago. The demand is growing, and Wall Street is adjusting fast. High-risk products gain traction despite warnings These new investments aren’t simple. Many are expensive, complex, and illiquid — and yet, people are still buying in. Blackstone’s real estate investment trust had to limit withdrawals in 2022 after interest rates spiked. Despite that, investors kept coming. Strategists at JPMorgan have told clients to lower exposure to private credit and equity because they’re lagging behind public markets again this year. One academic paper called alternatives “costly and wasteful,” and Moody’s warned that bringing retail investors into private markets adds serious liquidity risk to the system. Still, none of that has slowed demand. On TikTok and Reddit, the get-rich-quick mindset is spreading fast. The move isn’t just limited to Gen Z or millennials though. Chad Blackburn, a 45-year-old accountant in Nashville, started buying equities as a teen but now puts most of his cash into Bitcoin and startups. “The dotcom bubble and the great financial crisis forced me to think more deeply about my investments,” Chad said. “Why would I limit myself to just stocks and bonds, especially when a lot of this stuff is not nearly as diversified as you think?” Real estate, crypto, and private equity are the top picks for these investors. There’s a psychological angle too. Many believe traditional markets are rigged or too fragile. Owen Lamont, a portfolio manager at Acadian Asset Management, said, “They think the system is rigged against me. I have to do something out of the box in order to get rich.” The push from retail investors is also tied to exhaustion from institutional clients. Pensions, endowments, and insurers already allocate about 20% of their portfolios to alternatives. But individuals? Just 7%. That gap is huge, and Wall Street is chasing it. Chris Toomey, managing director at Morgan Stanley Private Wealth Management, explained the difference. Older investors prefer infrastructure and steady returns. The younger crowd leans into private equity. “They are at a point in their investment cycle where they have the ability to take on that risk,” Chris said. “They’re early investors and they’ve got a much longer time horizon.” But it’s not every young person. Vanguard says thousands of Gen Z and millennial savers are sitting on piles of cash in default IRAs instead of putting money into diversified portfolios. For every alt-hunter, there’s someone just hoarding dollars in money markets.

2025-06-23T14:30:42,"Bitcoin Price Eyes Critical $97K Support as Sentora Data Reveals Investor Wall","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Eyes Critical $97K Support as Sentora Data Reveals Investor Wall The cryptocurrency world is buzzing as Bitcoin price continues its fascinating dance around the significant $100,000 psychological barrier. While headlines often focus on round numbers, savvy investors and analysts look deeper, utilizing tools like on-chain data to understand the underlying market structure. This is where insights from platforms like Sentora come into play, offering a granular view of where investors are positioned and what that might mean for potential support and resistance levels. What Does Sentora Data Tell Us About BTC Support? Sentora, the on-chain data analytics platform formerly known as IntoTheBlock, recently shared a key observation regarding the current Bitcoin price action. According to their analysis, BTC is actively retesting the $100,000 level. More importantly, their data points to the $97,000 level as a crucial area of support. Why is this specific price point so important? Sentora’s data reveals a significant concentration of buying activity around the $97,000 mark. Specifically: Approximately 1.6 million unique addresses acquired Bitcoin at an average cost basis of $97,000. These addresses collectively hold a substantial amount of BTC, totaling around 1.14 million coins. This concentration of ownership at a particular price level often acts as a strong support zone. When the price approaches this level, investors who bought there are less likely to sell at a loss, and new buyers may see it as an attractive entry point, creating buying pressure that can help the price bounce. This phenomenon is often referred to as an ‘investor wall’ or a ‘support cluster’ based on cost basis. Understanding On-Chain Data and Its Value for the Crypto Market For those new to the concept, on-chain data refers to information directly recorded on the public blockchain ledger. Unlike traditional market analysis that relies on price charts and trading volumes from exchanges, on-chain analysis delves into the actual transactions, addresses, and movements of cryptocurrencies. This provides unique insights into: Investor Behavior: Tracking wallet activity, accumulation, distribution, and holding periods. Market Structure: Identifying concentrations of ownership, cost bases of different investor cohorts, and supply dynamics. Network Health: Analyzing transaction counts, fees, and mining activity. The Sentora data highlighting the $97,000 support is a prime example of how this type of analysis can provide a different perspective than standard technical indicators. It’s not just about lines on a chart; it’s about understanding where actual investors have placed their capital. Why is the $97K Level Critical for Bitcoin Price? As Bitcoin price tests the waters around $100,000, the $97,000 level identified by Sentora becomes a critical pivot point. Here’s why: Validation of Investor Conviction: If the price dips to $97,000 and bounces strongly, it validates the conviction of the 1.6 million addresses who bought there. It suggests they are holding firm and potentially adding more, reinforcing the support. Potential Springboard for Further Upside: A successful defense of this key support level could provide the necessary base for Bitcoin to gather momentum and potentially break convincingly above the $100,000 resistance. Warning Signal if Broken: Conversely, if the BTC support at $97,000 fails and the price drops significantly below it, it could indicate that even these committed investors are starting to feel pressure, potentially leading to cascading sell-offs as those who bought at $97,000 look to exit to avoid further losses. This could open the door to testing lower support levels. Therefore, monitoring the price action around $97,000 in the coming days and weeks, informed by Sentora data , will be crucial for anticipating Bitcoin’s next major move. Challenges and Considerations in Relying on Sentora Data Alone While on-chain data like that provided by Sentora offers invaluable insights, it’s important to remember it’s just one piece of the puzzle when analyzing the crypto market . Other factors significantly influence price action: Macroeconomic Factors: Interest rates, inflation data, global economic stability, and central bank policies all impact investor sentiment and capital flows into risk assets like Bitcoin. Regulatory News: Government regulations or lack thereof in major economies can create significant volatility. Market Sentiment and News Events: Major hacks, exchange issues, or positive developments (like ETF approvals) can trigger rapid price movements independent of underlying on-chain structure. Technical Analysis: Traditional chart patterns, indicators, and trading volumes from exchanges still play a vital role in understanding short-term price movements and trader psychology. Using Sentora data in conjunction with these other analytical methods provides a more holistic view of the market. The $97,000 level is a strong on-chain indicator, but its strength will be tested by the broader market environment. Actionable Insights from the $97K Sentora Data Based on the insights from Sentora regarding the BTC support at $97,000, here are some actionable takeaways: Monitor the Level: Keep a close eye on how Bitcoin price behaves if it approaches $97,000. Look for signs of buying pressure or a bounce. Assess Volume: If the price hits $97,000, observe the trading volume. A strong bounce on high volume could indicate robust support, while a weak bounce on low volume might suggest less conviction. Consider Your Strategy: If you are looking to buy Bitcoin, this level might be on your radar as a potential entry point, assuming it holds. If you are holding Bitcoin, understand that a break below this level could signal further downside risk. Combine Analysis: Don’t rely solely on Sentora data . Use it to complement your technical analysis and stay informed about broader market news. Understanding where significant clusters of investors have established their cost basis provides a powerful lens through which to view potential support zones in the crypto market . In Summary: The Significance of Sentora’s $97K Finding Sentora’s analysis highlighting the $97,000 level as a key support zone, backed by the presence of 1.6 million addresses holding 1.14 million BTC at that average price, offers valuable insight into the current market dynamics. As Bitcoin price navigates the territory around $100,000, this on-chain derived support level represents a significant potential floor established by a large cohort of investors. Whether this investor wall holds will likely play a crucial role in determining Bitcoin’s immediate trajectory. Monitoring this level, informed by on-chain data like that from Sentora, is essential for anyone tracking the crypto market .

In June 2022, the FTC filed a complaint alleging that from 2013 to 2018, Walmart turned a blind eye to scammers who exploited its in-store money transfer services to defraud US consumers out of hundreds of millions of dollars. The retailer serves as an agent of the money transfer service providers MoneyGram, Western Union and Ria. The complaint says that Walmart failed to implement effective anti-fraud policies and procedures, was remiss in providing proper training to its employees and did not adequately warn its customers about potential fraud related to money transfers. A year later, the regulator amended its complaint to add further details related to Walmart’s alleged telemarketing violations. A stipulated order filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division on Friday, aims to resolve the FTC’s claims concerning Walmart’s money-transfer services The settlement, which is still subject to the District Court judge’s approval, prohibits the retailer from providing “fraud-induced” money transfer services or assisting sellers or telemarketers who solicit goods, services or charitable contributions through telemarketing. The company is also barred from assisting those who ask consumers to pay for loans and credit extensions in advance.
