2025-06-23T12:50:51,"Texas Bitcoin Reserve: Strategic Move with SB 21 Solidifies Crypto Leadership","BitcoinWorld Texas Bitcoin Reserve: Strategic Move with SB 21 Solidifies Crypto Leadership A significant development is unfolding in the heart of the United States, one that could reshape the landscape of state-level asset management and technological adoption. Texas, long a leader in energy and innovation, has taken a bold step into the future of finance by officially establishing a strategic Texas Bitcoin Reserve . This move, solidified by the signing of Senate Bill 21 (SB 21), signals a growing acceptance and potential integration of digital assets into traditional government frameworks. Understanding SB 21 Texas: What Does the Bill Do? At its core, SB 21 Texas creates the legal framework necessary for the state to explore and potentially implement direct government investment in Bitcoin. While the initial news reports might sound straightforward, the implications of this legislation are multifaceted. The bill doesn’t necessarily mandate immediate large-scale purchases but rather establishes a fund and sets the stage for future action. It provides the statutory authority for state entities to consider holding Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Key aspects typically covered in such legislation include: Establishing a Fund: Creating a dedicated fund or account where digital assets like Bitcoin could be held. Defining Permissible Investments: Specifying the types of digital assets allowed (in this case, Bitcoin is explicitly mentioned). Setting Management Guidelines: Outlining how such assets would be acquired, stored securely, managed, and potentially liquidated. Mandating Studies or Reports: Often, initial legislation requires further study into the feasibility, risks, and benefits before large-scale implementation. The passage of SB 21 Texas represents a formal acknowledgment by the state government of Bitcoin’s growing importance and its potential role beyond just a speculative asset. It positions Bitcoin as something worthy of consideration within a state’s strategic financial planning. Why is Texas Positioned to Become a Texas Crypto Hub? Texas hasn’t just stumbled into the cryptocurrency space; it has actively cultivated an environment conducive to its growth. The signing of SB 21 is a natural progression for a state already making significant strides in the industry. Several factors contribute to Texas’s ambition to become a prominent Texas Crypto Hub : Energy Resources: Abundant and relatively low-cost energy, particularly from renewable sources and natural gas that would otherwise be flared, makes Texas an attractive location for energy-intensive Bitcoin mining operations. Favorable Regulatory Stance: Texas regulators and lawmakers have generally adopted a supportive or at least open-minded approach to blockchain and digital assets, contrasting with stricter stances elsewhere. Tech and Innovation Focus: Texas has a strong history of fostering technological innovation, from its roots in the oil industry to its burgeoning tech sector in cities like Austin. Cryptocurrency fits into this narrative. Political Will: Governor Abbott and other state leaders have publicly expressed interest in and support for the cryptocurrency industry, seeing it as a way to attract investment and jobs. Establishing a Texas Bitcoin Reserve through SB 21 Texas sends a clear signal to crypto businesses, investors, and innovators worldwide: Texas is serious about digital assets and aims to be at the forefront of this technological revolution. This strategic move reinforces its image as a leading Texas Crypto Hub . Exploring the Vision: Government Bitcoin Investment The concept of Government Bitcoin Investment at a state level is still relatively new and sparks considerable debate. What is the strategic thinking behind a state holding Bitcoin? Proponents often cite several potential benefits: Potential Benefits of Government Bitcoin Investment: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin is often viewed by proponents as a potential hedge against inflation and the devaluation of fiat currencies due to its fixed supply. Holding a portion of state assets in Bitcoin could be seen as a way to preserve purchasing power over the long term. Asset Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin to a state’s reserve portfolio could potentially reduce overall portfolio risk and enhance returns, similar to how large institutions and corporations are exploring diversification into digital assets. Attracting Investment and Talent: A state actively involved in Government Bitcoin Investment signals its commitment to the future of finance, potentially attracting innovative companies and skilled workers in the blockchain and crypto sectors. Pioneering State-Level Adoption: By being among the first states to formally establish a Bitcoin reserve, Texas positions itself as a leader in exploring new financial technologies and asset classes for public funds. Supporting the Local Industry: State investment could indirectly support the Texas-based crypto industry, including miners and technology providers. This potential Government Bitcoin Investment moves beyond simply being crypto-friendly; it suggests a potential active participation in the asset class itself, aiming to reap direct benefits for the state’s treasury. Navigating the Challenges and Considerations While the prospects are exciting for proponents, Government Bitcoin Investment also comes with significant challenges that the framework established by SB 21 Texas will need to address: Challenges and Considerations: Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price swings. A state holding significant amounts would need robust strategies to manage this volatility and potential public scrutiny during downturns. Security: Storing large quantities of Bitcoin securely requires specialized knowledge and infrastructure to protect against hacks, theft, and loss of private keys. Regulatory Landscape: While Texas may be friendly, the overall U.S. regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, which could impact the management and reporting requirements for state-held assets. Public and Political Opinion: Investing taxpayer money in a volatile and sometimes controversial asset like Bitcoin could face political opposition and public skepticism. Custody and Management: Developing secure, transparent, and accountable methods for acquiring, holding, and potentially selling Bitcoin for a state government is a complex operational challenge. Valuation and Accounting: Determining the value of Bitcoin holdings for state accounting purposes and reporting can be complicated. Effective Bitcoin Legislation like SB 21 Texas must lay the groundwork for addressing these challenges, likely involving detailed studies, expert consultation, and clear guidelines for risk management and security protocols for the Texas Bitcoin Reserve . Global and National Context: Is Government Bitcoin Investment Becoming a Trend? Texas is not operating in a vacuum. The idea of Government Bitcoin Investment or exploring digital assets at a state or national level is gaining traction globally. El Salvador famously adopted Bitcoin as legal tender and holds it on its balance sheet. Other countries and sub-national entities are exploring various levels of engagement, from accepting crypto for taxes to studying reserve possibilities. Within the U.S., while no other state has yet established a formal reserve fund like the one proposed by SB 21 Texas , several states and cities are exploring crypto-friendly policies, blockchain technology adoption, and even pilot programs for accepting crypto payments. Texas’s move sets a precedent for other states considering similar Bitcoin Legislation . This broader trend indicates a shift in how governments perceive digital assets, moving from outright skepticism to a more nuanced exploration of their potential economic and strategic benefits. The Texas Bitcoin Reserve is a prominent example of this evolving perspective. What This Means for the Future of the Texas Crypto Hub The establishment of the Texas Bitcoin Reserve via SB 21 Texas is more than just a symbolic gesture. It’s a concrete step that could have lasting impacts on the state’s economy and its position within the global digital asset landscape. For businesses in the crypto space, this legislation enhances Texas’s appeal as a place to operate and invest. A state government actively engaging with Bitcoin signals stability and a forward-thinking approach that can attract capital and talent. It reinforces Texas’s status as a leading Texas Crypto Hub . For Texas residents, while direct impacts may not be immediate, a successful strategic reserve could potentially contribute to the state’s financial health over the long term. It also places Texas at the cutting edge of financial innovation, potentially leading to new job opportunities and economic growth related to the digital asset sector. The implementation details following SB 21 Texas will be crucial. How the reserve is funded, managed, and secured will determine its ultimate success and influence. However, the legislative foundation is now firmly in place for Texas to explore Government Bitcoin Investment in a structured manner. Conclusion: Texas Solidifies Its Digital Asset Ambitions Governor Greg Abbott’s signing of SB 21 Texas marks a pivotal moment for the state and the broader cryptocurrency industry. By establishing a strategic Texas Bitcoin Reserve , Texas is not only creating a mechanism for potential Government Bitcoin Investment but is also reinforcing its commitment to becoming a dominant Texas Crypto Hub . This move reflects a forward-looking strategy aimed at asset diversification, attracting innovation, and potentially hedging against economic uncertainties. While challenges remain, the passage of this significant piece of Bitcoin Legislation demonstrates Texas’s determination to be a leader in the evolving digital financial landscape.

Here Are the Details","Green Minerals AS, a pioneer in deep-sea mining and sustainable mineral extraction, announced today that it has adopted the Bitcoin Treasury Strategy. The company positions this move as the first step in its overall blockchain strategy. Green Minerals Announces Adoption of Norway's First Bitcoin Treasury Strategy With this strategic decision, Green Minerals aims to reduce its dependence on traditional fiat assets and protect its balance sheet in a global economic environment where high inflation and geopolitical uncertainties are increasing. “A strong balance sheet is more important than ever at a time of such monetary policy expansion. Bitcoin’s decentralized and inflation-resistant nature offers a powerful alternative to traditional money.” Green Minerals plans to make Bitcoin treasury the core asset in a financing plan of up to $1.2 billion with its partners. This goal coincides with the company’s first HEDSM (Hedge-Enabled Digital Strategy Model) to be launched within the framework of the “Responsible Production Partnership”. The company also plans to collaborate with expert advisors to conduct Bitcoin purchases in a “transparent and secure framework.” In this context, a new performance indicator, “Bitcoin per share (BTC/share),” will be introduced. This will provide investors with a system that will directly track the value of the digital asset falling on their shares. Green Minerals plans to leverage blockchain technology not only in the financial arena, but also in areas such as supply chain transparency, certification of mineral origins, and operational efficiency. By integrating this technology throughout the value chain, the company aims to pioneer future regulations and maintain its competitiveness in the sector. Green Minerals has announced that it aims to make its first Bitcoin purchase in the next few days. The company has pledged to be transparent about every stage of the process. With this strategic move, Green Minerals not only consolidates its leadership in sustainable mining, but also takes a pioneering stance in the financial and technological fields. *This is not investment advice.

I (CCCM), a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) sponsored by an affiliate of Cohen & Company. The transaction, announced Monday, positions the new entity, ProCap Financial, Inc., as one of the largest bitcoin treasuries ever to hit public markets. In what’s being called the largest initial fundraise for a public bitcoin BTC treasury company to date, ProCap raised $550 million in preferred equity and secured $225 million in convertible notes, giving future shareholders immediate exposure to bitcoin through a structure designed to acquire BTC ahead of the deal's close. Led by Pompliano, a well-known investor and vocal bitcoin advocate, ProCap aims to operate at the intersection of digital assets and traditional finance. The company plans to generate profit not just by holding BTC but by actively deploying its bitcoin balance sheet across yield-generating strategies that mitigate risk and capitalize on crypto-financial infrastructure. ""The legacy financial system is being disrupted by bitcoin,"" Pompliano said in a statement. ""ProCap Financial represents our solution to the increasing demand for bitcoin-native financial services among sophisticated investors."" The merger values the combined entity at up to $1 billion, depending on the final bitcoin purchase price at closing. ProCap’s BTC assets will be custodied until the transaction completes, giving investors near-instant BTC exposure without waiting for the company to go public. The transaction is expected to close before the end of 2025, pending SEC review and shareholder approval.

2025-06-23T12:47:22,"Reactions As Cointelegraph Asks Crypto Community to Describe XRP In 3 Words","A recent post by leading crypto news outlet Cointelegraph has sparked a wave of passionate and creative reactions from the XRP community. In a simple yet thought-provoking prompt, Cointelegraph asked on X: “Describe $XRP in 3 words.” The post quickly went viral, drawing responses from top influencers, analysts, and long-time XRP holders, each offering their take on what the asset truly represents. Community Voices: Strong Belief in XRP’s Potential Veteran XRP advocate The Bearable Bull responded with “Most Undervalued Asset,” capturing a sentiment widely shared by the XRP community. Many believe XRP’s true value remains unrealized due to years of regulatory challenges and market suppression, despite its solid use case in cross-border payments. Edo Farina, CEO of Alpha Lions Academy and a vocal supporter of XRP, responded with “Better Than Bitcoin.” This bold comparison reflects a long-standing debate in the crypto space, where XRP enthusiasts argue the token is faster, cheaper, and more scalable than Bitcoin, especially for financial institutions. Describe $XRP in 3 words. pic.twitter.com/92JpownEg9 — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) June 22, 2025 Popular chart analyst Dark Defender delivered a succinct and confident take: “The One.” His choice of words suggests XRP is not just another altcoin, but the digital asset that will play a central role in the future financial system. Realism, Sarcasm, and Frustration Not all reactions were purely optimistic. Influencer JD offered a more ironic view, saying: “Rekt many people” and “I’m calling TOP.” These comments reflect the frustration of investors who have held through multiple price crashes, long periods of stagnation, and unfulfilled bullish predictions. While XRP boasts significant utility, the lack of consistent price appreciation has tested the patience of many long-time holders. Still, faith in the long-term vision remains strong for others. POW Group labeled XRP “The Chosen One,” reaffirming a common belief that XRP was designed for a specific purpose— solving global liquidity problems . Similarly, Calogero urged followers to “Trust the Process,” a mantra often used by those taking a long-term, fundamentals-based approach to investing. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional Narrative and Broader Vision Perhaps one of the most intriguing responses came from Vandell of Black Swan Capitalist, who described XRP as “The PayPal Mafia.” Though cryptic, this phrase may suggest that XRP and Ripple are cultivating a network of influential partners, akin to how PayPal alumni went on to shape the tech industry, who are poised to disrupt global finance . Two influential accounts, Nick of Crypto Crusader and the Good Morning Crypto podcast, both used the term “Internet of Value.” This phrase has become synonymous with Ripple’s long-term vision: enabling value to move across borders as easily and quickly as information moves today. XRP, in this vision, serves as the core liquidity bridge in a new global payments infrastructure. A Community Still Deeply Invested While Cointelegraph’s question may have seemed casual, the responses revealed deep emotional investment and ongoing engagement within the XRP community. Whether through hopeful optimism, tempered realism, or strategic foresight, one thing is clear—XRP continues to inspire conversation, loyalty, and belief. As Ripple moves forward with global partnerships and regulatory developments, XRP remains a central topic in the evolving digital economy, described in just three words, but backed by years of conviction.

2025-06-23T12:30:00,"MiCA Drives EU Crypto Growth as Semler Challenges US Doubt","Europe’s unified approach to cryptocurrency regulation is beginning to yield tangible results, with trading volumes and investor confidence on the rise across the EU. At the same time, Eric Semler — chairman of Semler Scientific and a long-time contrarian investor — is reaffirming his company’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy despite doubts from traditional hedge fund peers in the US. Europe Surges Ahead in Global Crypto Race as MiCA Spurs Record Growth Europe has taken a commanding lead in the global cryptocurrency race, propelled by its newly implemented Markets in Crypto-Assets ( MiCA ) regulation. While the United States grapples with fragmented state-level oversight and legislative ambiguity, the European Union is seeing a wave of crypto activity, particularly among retail investors, thanks to its comprehensive and harmonized regulatory framework. The shift is already being felt in market activity. According to Konstantins Vasilenko, co-founder and chief business development officer at Paybis, EU customer trading volumes on the platform soared 70% quarter-on-quarter in Q1 2025, just as MiCA officially took effect on Jan. 1. “The timing is hard to ignore,” Vasilenko said. “MiCA’s licensing window opened in January. In that very quarter, our EU volumes jumped 70% while the number of trades hardly moved, which tells me the new money was larger and more deliberate.” At the same time, Paybis reported a downtrend in activity from US-based users, mirroring a broader pattern of retail retreat across American trading platforms. Kaiko estimates that retail activity now comprises just 18% of Coinbase’s spot trading volume, down from 40% in 2021. Robinhood reported a 35% drop in crypto trading in Q1 2025. The surge in European activity reflects growing investor confidence, underpinned by the key provisions of MiCA. The regulation introduces a single licensing regime for crypto-asset service providers (CASPs), allowing companies authorized in one EU country to “passport” their license across all 27 member states. This removes the regulatory patchwork that previously slowed pan-European crypto adoption. MiCA also enforces strict rules on stablecoins, requiring full 1:1 fiat reserves, regular audits, and clear segregation of client assets. Investor protections similar to those found under MiFID, including disclosure requirements, cooling-off periods, and transparent fee structures, offer users a more predictable and legally secure experience. Major Platforms Embrace MiCA In anticipation of MiCA’s full enforcement, several major crypto platforms have already secured licenses under the new regime. OKX, Crypto.com, and Bybit were early movers, while Coinbase recently received authorization from the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF), allowing it to operate across the bloc. Despite President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto rhetoric and growing interest in digital assets among US investors, the country continues to suffer from an unclear regulatory environment. Crypto firms still face state-by-state money transmitter licensing, ongoing lawsuits from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and a lack of consistent federal legislation. The contrast with Europe’s unified MiCA framework couldn’t be starker. While US firms navigate red tape and regulatory unpredictability, Europe is already benefiting from a surge of capital, innovation, and user engagement. France, Germany, and the Netherlands Lead the Way France has emerged as a key beneficiary of this new wave. Paybis reported a 175% increase in activity from French users, a jump Vasilenko attributes to the country’s regulatory head start through the 2019 PACTE law, which required crypto exchanges to register under anti-money laundering (AML) rules. Home to fintech hubs like Station F and guided by the proactive stance of the AMF (Autorité des marchés financiers), France is on track to become one of the most crypto-active nations in Europe, with user penetration expected to reach 24% of the population this year. Germany, meanwhile, leads in institutional infrastructure. Deutsche Boerse’s Clearstream arm is preparing to offer crypto settlement services, paving the way for institutional investors to enter the space with confidence. The Netherlands continues to be a heavyweight in payments and integration infrastructure, giving users seamless fiat-to-crypto access. While the US currently lags behind, a comeback is still possible. The proposed GENIUS Act , working its way through Congress, could introduce federal licensing for crypto firms and define regulatory standards for dollar-backed stablecoins. If passed before the end of 2025, Vasilenko believes the bill could “do for US retail what MiCA just did for Europeans,” potentially leveling the playing field between the two economic giants. Eric Semler Doubles Down on Bitcoin as Hedge Fund Peers Remain Skeptical While skepticism looms among many hedge fund managers about Bitcoin’s long-term viability, especially in a post-Trump America, one seasoned investor remains defiantly bullish. Eric Semler, chairman of Semler Scientific Inc. and founder of TCS Capital Management, has positioned himself and his company as unwavering believers in the future of Bitcoin — regardless of the political climate. In a candid interview with Coin Stories host Natalie Brunell on Thursday, Semler addressed growing uncertainty within traditional finance circles. He claimed many of his hedge fund peers see Bitcoin as a short-lived phenomenon, propped up largely by the current administration’s support. “I think that they think it is a fly-by-night concept and that it is probably going to, after the Trump administration, go back down a lot,” Semler said. This sentiment echoes broader concerns in the crypto space about how long the US government’s favorable stance will last. While President Donald Trump recently approved the formation of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, some, like JAN3 CEO Samson Mow, worry that a future administration could undo that progress. But for Semler, this uncertainty only sharpens his conviction. Semler has never shied away from taking contrarian positions. Having founded hedge fund TCS Capital in 2001, he built his reputation — and his fortune — on going against the grain. “The best investments I’ve ever made have been in things that I’m kind of the lone voice crying in the wilderness,” he told Brunell. “Those are the types of investments that have the highest returns.” And Bitcoin, in his eyes, is no exception. Semler Scientific first made headlines in May 2024 when it became only the second publicly traded US company to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy, following in the footsteps of MicroStrategy. As of June 2025, the company holds 4,449 BTC — worth over $450 million at current prices — and recently unveiled plans to scale that figure up to an astonishing 105,000 BTC by the end of 2027. Top corporate BTC holders (Source: BitcoinTreasuries ) The roadmap includes an ambitious goal of reaching 10,000 BTC by the end of this year. Contrarian Confidence Amid Industry Doubt “I love the negativity; I’m a contrarian investor,” Semler said. “When you’re making a bet on something that the majority doesn’t believe in, and you’re right, you make so much more money.” This attitude stands in stark contrast to the cautious approach adopted by many in the traditional finance world. Despite increasing exposure to crypto among hedge funds, the dominant narrative among legacy investors remains cautious — if not outright skeptical. Surveys back up this divide. A 2024 report by PwC and the Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA) found that 47% of hedge fund managers trading in traditional markets are now exposed to cryptocurrencies, up from 29% in 2023 and 37% in 2022. The data reflects growing adoption but also significant reluctance among the majority. Even more telling, a 2021 Intertrust Global survey found that while 98% of CFOs at major hedge funds anticipated crypto allocations by 2026, the average exposure was projected to be just 7.2% of total assets. That’s a far cry from Semler Scientific’s trajectory, which appears to be steering toward one of the most aggressive corporate Bitcoin strategies in history. Post-Trump Uncertainty One of the key concerns dampening institutional enthusiasm is the uncertainty surrounding US crypto policy after President Trump’s term. While the current administration has enacted pro-Bitcoin policies, including the creation of a strategic reserve and support for crypto-friendly legislation, the future remains unclear. Semler acknowledges these risks but believes that Bitcoin’s fundamentals — its scarcity, decentralization, and increasing global adoption — transcend political cycles.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9659/mi-ca-drives-eu-crypto-growth-as-semler-challenges-us-doubt,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-06-23T12:25:26,"Grant Cardone’s Real Estate Empire Makes $101M Bitcoin Move","Billionaire real estate mogul Grant Cardone has entered the world of digital assets, announcing that his private equity firm, Cardone Capital, has made its first major Bitcoin purchase. On Saturday, Cardone revealed on X that the firm has acquired 1,000 BTC, worth over $101 million at current market prices, in a move he described as combining “the two best-in-class assets” — real estate and Bitcoin. With this acquisition, Cardone Capital became the first real estate investment firm to fully integrate a Bitcoin strategy into its treasury . The company plans to add another 3,000 BTC by the end of the year, signaling a significant commitment to BTC as a long-term store of value alongside its traditional property investments. According to on-chain tracker BiTBO, this holding places Cardone Capital ahead of mining firms such as Core Scientific and Cipher Mining in terms of BTC reserves. Blending Real Estate Cash Flow with Bitcoin Treasury Founded in 2017, Cardone Capital manages over 14,000 multifamily residential units and more than $5.1 billion in assets. The firm pools investor capital to acquire income-generating real estate, and now plans to funnel a portion of those cash flows into Bitcoin purchases. In May, Cardone introduced the 10X Miami River Bitcoin Fund — a dual-asset investment product that merges a 346-unit commercial property on the Miami River with $15 million worth of BTC. Explaining the strategy, Cardone credited his brother for sparking the idea: “Buy real estate, add Bitcoin, and then use the real estate cash flow to buy more Bitcoin,” he said at the time. This evolving approach reflects a growing trend among companies seeking to hedge inflation and diversify their treasuries by adopting digital assets, particularly BTC. Metaplanet and Strategy Also Stack Sats Cardone Capital isn’t alone in boosting its Bitcoin exposure. Japanese investment firm Metaplanet announced the purchase of 1,111 BTC on Monday at an average price of $105,700 per coin. This brings its total holdings to 11,111 BTC, now valued at around $1.12 billion. Meanwhile, Strategy founder Michael Saylor once again hinted at a fresh BTC purchase, sharing a portfolio chart with the cryptic caption: “Nothing Stops This Orange.” Saylor’s firm currently holds nearly $61 billion worth of BTC and has historically made new acquisitions following such weekend posts. With institutional interest on the rise, the momentum behind Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset appears far from slowing.

Long liquidations alone topped $400 million for three consecutive days—a rare occurrence that signalled a sharp reversal in sentiment. What began as a promising week for BTC quickly turned into one of the worst since January, as macro headwinds like rising oil prices, stagflation fears, and renewed geopolitical tensions spooked traders and amplified downside pressure. Total crypto market liquidations surged past $2.6 billion, with altcoins like ETH and SOL plunging over 20 percent. Yet amid the chaos, Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded strong net inflows of $1.02 billion, underlining growing institutional conviction. This structural demand helped stabilise BTC’s price within a wide $94K–$110K range, even as derivatives markets underwent a major deleveraging . With open interest now resetting to healthier levels and funding rates normalising, the path ahead will hinge on whether ETF inflows continue—or whether a break in this support signals a deeper shift in market mood. The Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady in June but signaled growing concern over slowing economic growth, persistent inflation, and political pressure. Powell warned that tariffs will likely cause a “meaningful” increase in consumer prices as businesses pass on the cost, reinforcing the Fed’s cautious stance. Adding to inflationary pressures, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, especially around the Strait of Hormuz—a critical oil route—have rattled global oil markets . A spike in freight costs and falling tanker activity signal market anxiety, and oil prices could soar if disruptions escalate. Gasoline futures have already climbed sharply , tightening consumer budgets and posing a challenge for central banks, which now face the dilemma of either delaying rate cuts or risking inflation persistence. On the consumer side, May retail sales showed a 0.9 percent drop, led by declines in car, fuel, and restaurant spending. However, core retail sales still grew, hinting at resilient discretionary spending. Businesses, anticipating tariff hikes, have built up wholesale inventories since late 2024, but retail shelves remained understocked. As retailers restock at higher costs in the coming months, especially ahead of the holiday season, a second wave of inflation may emerge . Together, rising oil prices, tariff pass-throughs, and seasonal restocking could push inflation higher by fall, complicating the Fed’s path and delaying expected rate cuts. Donald Trump’s 2024 financial disclosure showed over $600 million in income, driven largely by crypto ventures like the $TRUMP coin and World Liberty Financial. His deep involvement in crypto, real estate, and global branding has sparked ethical concerns over blurred lines between business and politics. At the same time, Vietnam passed a landmark law giving legal status to crypto assets starting in 2026, offering incentives to attract blockchain innovation and positioning itself as a regional tech hub. Meanwhile, Iran’s largest exchange, Nobitex, was hit by a politically driven cyberattack that destroyed up to $100 million in assets—highlighting crypto’s growing entanglement with global conflict.

2025-06-23T12:22:08,"Analyst sets Bitcoin’s next short-term high target after weekend sell-off","A trading expert is projecting that technical indicators support a potential Bitcoin ( BTC ) rally toward $110,000 as the asset attempts to recover from the weekend sell-off . Notably, Bitcoin briefly plunged below $100,000 on Sunday following a market-wide decline triggered by a U.S. strike on Iran’s nuclear facility , aligning Washington with Israel in the ongoing Middle East conflict. According to an analysis by TradingShot , the recent drop formed a descending channel similar to the correction between December 17, 2024, and January 13, 2025. In both cases, Bitcoin broke below the 50-day moving average ( MA ) and formed a lower low. The January move led to a sharp reversal that retested the all-time high, the analyst noted in a TradingView post on June 23. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView TradingShot also pointed out that the Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) is once again testing the 41.20 support level, reinforcing the similarity between the two patterns. Given the shorter uptrend since the April 7, 2025, low, the analyst suggested this could be a bull flag, often seen as a continuation pattern within a broader bullish cycle. While a medium-term breakout remains unconfirmed until a weekly candle closes above the record high, T radingShot has set a provisional target of $111,900 for the next potential high. Bitcoin’s short-term play Meanwhile, prominent trader Michaël van de Poppe commented in a June 23 X post that Bitcoin’s reclaim of the $100,000 level marked a possible liquidity grab below prior lows, a bear trap that triggered strong buying interest. Poppe noted that Bitcoin may consolidate in the short term, but a breakout above $102,500 could confirm the end of the correction and spark a renewed rally. He identified $103,800 as a key level for bulls to target. #Bitcoin bounces up swiftly. The second option is filled, peak liquidity taken beneath the low at $100,500 and quick reversal upwards. I think we'll stall for a bit, and once it breaks $102,500, it will likely accelerate upwards and then, the correction is over. pic.twitter.com/d6I12ZMhS7 — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) June 23, 2025 Bitcoin price analysis At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $101,260, down 1.4% on the day and over 3% on the weekly chart.

While most altcoins display weakness after testing crucial support zones, Self Chain dominates trends with a bold leadership update, which has seen its native token, SLF, gain 17% on its daily price chart. Self Chain has terminated CEO Ravindra Kumar following crucial claims about his involvement in an unauthorized $50 million OTC (over-the-counter) crypto fraud. Ravindra Kumar’s role as CEO has been formally terminated. He will no longer hold any position, responsibility, or association with Self Chain in any capacity going forward. Self Chain @selfchainxyz · Follow Self Chain Governance UpdateDue to recent developments that diverge from the founding vision of Self Chain, we are initiating a decisive leadership transition that reinforces our long-term vision.This marks an important step in realigning Self Chain with its core principles 11:34 am · 23 Jun 2025 61 Reply Copy link Read 31 replies Self Chain’s governance change comes at a time when the community and projects join forces to fight the rising crypto scams. Optimism propelled SLF’s price to the upside even as bears dominated the crypto space after the weekend’s flash dip. Self Chain expels CEO Ravindra According to Self Chain’s X post, Ravindra Kumar will no longer have any official role within the firm. The team emphasized that actions that contradicted the project’s founding goals, especially connected to illegal OTC deals, prompted the CEO’s removal. Due to recent developments that diverge from the founding vision of Self Chain, we are initiating a decisive leadership transition that reinforces our long-term vision. This marks an important step in realigning Self Chain with its core principles of decentralization, transparency, and community-driven development. Meanwhile, Kumar’s fraud allegations attracted community backlash and risked Self Chain’s reputation as a community-driven, transparent LQ blockchain. The CEO’s termination likely reflects the platform’s commitment to safeguarding its status and refocusing on its core values. The team reaffirmed its dedication to Self Chain’s vision. They assured that no other team member participated in the alleged misconduct and that fraudulent activities weren’t linked to the project. The project distanced itself from illegal SLF over-the-counter sales. They emphasized never authorizing any founding member to participate in OTC transactions involving the native token. That means Self Chain didn’t approve and doesn’t recognize any SLF transactions outside official channels. The termination and reassurance helped restore investor confidence, who praised Self Chain’s swift move and transparency. SLF price jumps on community optimism The native token jumped from $0.08183 on its daily chart to a $0.09614 intraday high. That translated to a 17.49% jump, an eye-catching price move as bears dominate the digital assets space. SLF trades at $0.08701 after correcting from its daily high. The 86% uptick in 24-hour trading volume underscored revived investor and trader interest in the altcoin.

Companies like Kryptovault have established operations outside Oslo — running data centres up to 40 MW, recycling heat to dry wood or warm nearby buildings.

Matrixport: Ethereum Price Rises on Futures Positions, Lacks Fundamental Support The report stated that Ethereum’s recent sharp pullback was a result of an overheated market structure due to the use of high leverage. Matrixport emphasized that leverage levels are still high, warning that this could create more selling pressure in the short term. On the other hand, the company stated that Bitcoin (BTC) has tried to turn its direction upwards with reaction purchases in recent days, but considering seasonal trends, this recovery is unlikely to be sustainable. According to Matrixport, it is critical for Bitcoin to defend the $98,000 level to maintain its current technical structure. A breakdown below this level could trigger a broader correction. The analysis also emphasized that due to the intensity of leveraged long positions, sharp downward movements in the market could occur again in the short term. Due to this structure of Ethereum, a warning was made that it could lose value more quickly in the event of a possible negative news flow or market shock.

2025-06-23T12:02:15,"The State of Web3: A Global Look at Where Crypto Is Gaining Ground","The post The State of Web3: A Global Look at Where Crypto Is Gaining Ground appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Web3 ecosystem has gained significant traction in recent years, with more people across the world becoming everyday crypto users. According to the latest report by Crypto.com, the number of crypto owners across the world surged by 14% in 2024 to hit 659 million by the end of the year. The total market capitalization of digital assets has also doubled from $1.7 trillion at the onset of 2024 to around $3.3 trillion as of writing. In this article, we’ll dive into some of the key growth trends in Web3, including where the most adoption has been happening, regulatory factors at play as well as the strategic role of retail-focused exchanges like XBO when it comes to onboarding more stakeholders from emerging markets like the LATAM region and EMEA. Crypto Awareness is on an Uptrend in Emerging Economies According to a recent Web3 global survey by Consensys, 93% of the people surveyed across the world are aware of crypto assets. What’s more intriguing, however, is the level of awareness in emerging countries; most of the respondents who claim to understand crypto were from Nigeria (77%), South Africa (65%) and India (60%). At the same time, crypto ownership is also significantly higher in these emerging economies; Nigeria leads the pack again with the number of respondents who own or have previously owned crypto at 73%, South Africa (68%) the Philippines (54%), Vietnam (54%) and India (52%). The percentage of Africans or Asians who intend to invest in crypto assets within the next one year was also significantly higher compared to other regions. Source: Consensys The U.S. Leads in Institutional Adoption, But Not Yet There… According to Chainalysis ‘ 2024 Global Adoption Index ’, the U.S ranked fourth in the overall indexing which comprised four major metrics; Centralized service value received ranking, Retail centralized service value received ranking, DeFi value received ranking, Retail DeFi value received ranking. What stood out was the amount of institutional capital from U.S. companies that found its way into the crypto market. For context, Bitcoin Spot ETFs attracted over $129 billion in inflows between their launch date on January 10, 2024 and the close of the year. Source: Farside But despite the impressive institutional figures, it is worth noting that retail adoption isn’t picking up as much in the U.S. compared to the emerging economies mentioned above. This can be attributed to the uncertain regulatory environment compared to other advanced regions like Europe where MiCA provisions came into full application on December, 30 2024. On the brighter side, the U.S. senate recently passed the Genius act which sailed through with a 68 – 30 vote; with the bill now going to the House, there is a good chance it will become the first of its kind stablecoin regulatory framework for companies looking to issue or manage this type of digital asset within the U.S.A. At the core, the Genius Act introduces clarity in stablecoin regulation, protecting consumers and reinforcing national security measures when dealing with stablecoins. “The bipartisan GENIUS Act will provide regulatory clarity to this important industry, keep innovation on shore, add robust consumer protection, and reaffirm the dominance of the U.S. dollar,” – noted the co-sponsor of the bill, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). MiCA Framework Has Positioned Europe for Web3 Innovation As mentioned in the previous section, the MiCA framework is now in full effect. While this regulation had earlier on been met with skepticism, more crypto companies are setting up shop in Europe thanks to the clarity it provides. Some of the notable firms that have received a MiCA license since the framework was adopted include OKX which has established its European base in Malta, Crypto.com also a similar path during the same wave. Both crypto exchanges now have the flexibility to provide their services across the EU owing to the passporting provision for MiCA-licensed entities. The latest survey on Web3 startups indicated that Europe tops the world with over 3900 crypto startups; while this number may have reduced as most of these companies were not MiCA-compliant at the time of the survey, it is evident that the clarity in registration has placed Europe ahead when it comes to Web3 innovation. A Growing Market in LATAM Countries Another worthy observation is the growing Web3 market in LATAM countries. Out of the top 20 in the Chainalysis adoption list, LATAM countries featured prominently with the likes of Brazil, Venezuela, Mexico and Argentina making the cut. What’s particularly interesting in these markets is the levels at which adoption is happening. In Argentina for example, the football governing body, Argentine Football Association (AFA) has partnered with XBO, a leading digital crypto exchange focused on making digital asset trading secure, accessible and user-friendly. This strategic partnership is testament to a growing demand by LATAM countries, from retail to institutions to governments like El Salvador which had already adopted Bitcoin as legal tender but dropped it earlier this year following pressure from the IMF. It is also worth noting that LATAM was the second faster growing region, with a 42.5% year-over-year growth in crypto adoption according to the Chainlysis report. Source: Chainalysis Conclusion Web3 has come a long since Bitcoin’s debut in 2009; today, crypto is the only financial market globally that trades 24/7. But more importantly, we’re witnessing the adoption of Web3 both on a retail and institutional level.

2025-06-23T12:00:55,"XRP To $30 Beyond 2026? Analyst Reveals Key BTC Ratio To Watch","The market technician known on X as Dr Cat (@DoctorCatX) has published a post that condenses years of his XRP/BTC work into one number—2,041 satoshis—and a set of time-stamped price targets that reach as high as $30 per XRP once Bitcoin hits $270,000. In the post, the analyst begins with a sharp rebuke of critics who, in his words, “pretend to be idiots just to troll” before pivoting to a rigorously structured roadmap. He breaks price action into five nested horizons—intraday, daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly—and assigns each its own decision-making role. XRP Moon Scenario: $30 Target Needs One Final Signal The crux of the argument is that monthly price candles must be read in isolation from what he calls the “noise” of the lower frames if traders want to understand where serious accumulation or distribution is taking place. “Bullish target: ~$4–4.5 (3.5 K sats on 120–130 K BTC). Very bullish target: ~$18–30 (7 K–12 K sats / 270 K BTC).” Those levels are not merely numeric goals; they are the by-product of a ratio he views as structural. A monthly close below 2,041 satoshis would, paradoxically, increase his confidence in the “very bullish” path—but only “very long term (2026+),” because such a breakdown would probably trigger what he calls a flush toward 1,800, 1,500 or even 700 sats first. Conversely, a defense of that shelf preserves a less spectacular—but cleaner—advance toward 3,500 sats (~$4–4.50 at current six-figure Bitcoin prices) and keeps alive the 7,000-to-12,000-satoshi objective for the extended cycle top. Related Reading: XRP Daily New Addresses Plunge 80% In 2025 — Bearish On-Chain Metrics Raise Alarm The thread’s most practical value may lie in its explanation of why no immediate weekly up-trend should be expected even in the “most bullish” scenario. Dr Cat points to classic Ichimoku conditions—Chikou Span under price, a downward-angled Kijun-sen and a bearish Tenkan/Kijun cross—arguing that history shows it can take “~26 weeks at least” for those signals to unwind. Any rally toward 2,700 sats in the next couple of months would therefore be viewed as a Kijun retest ripe for rejection rather than the start of a sustained breakout. The analyst also clarifies a point that has caused confusion among casual readers: his $270,000 Bitcoin estimate is a macro-cycle cap, not a near-term forecast. He explicitly states that he expects the current market cycle to “extend to 2026 and beyond,” which is why the loftiest XRP numbers sit at the far right of his timeline. Everything, he insists, flows from the ratio between the two assets, not from dollar-denominated targets considered in isolation. Related Reading: ‘Out of Time’: XRP Consolidation Hits Final Moment, Analyst Alerts Context comes in the form of a brief exchange with a skeptic posting under the handle “Woo tard of Wall St”, who mocked the notion of a $7 XRP at 270,000 BTC. Dr Cat’s reply—delivered without diluting his language—underscores how strongly he views the time-horizon mismatch between traders who obsess over daily candles and those who plot quarterly swings. Technicians may quibble with the assumption that one static ratio can govern a three-year outlook, but the post offers a coherent, internally consistent playbook: watch the monthly close against 2,041 sats. Hold it, and the roadmap favors an eventual attack on 3,500 sats and, later, 7,000-plus. Lose it, and the pair probably capitulates before any “monster move” can emerge in the second half of the decade. Either outcome, Dr Cat argues, will resolve whether the XRP narrative of under-performance finally gives way to what would be its most spectacular out-performance against Bitcoin since 2017. For market participants seeking a single data point to anchor their risk management, 2,041 satoshis now functions as that fulcrum. Until the monthly candle prints, every tick above or below the line will feed the debate over whether XRP is coiling for a generational breakout—or simply rehearsing another round of disappointment. At press time, XRP traded at $2.01.

He shared a simple chart on X with the phrase “Nothing Stops This Orange.” It wasn’t some marketing slogan. It was a signal. Strategy now holds over 592,000 BTC, valued at nearly $60 billion, with Bitcoin trading just under $101,000. Short tweets from Saylor have sparked fresh buying runs before. This time could be no different. Michael Saylor Teases New Bitcoin Buy Michael Saylor’s cryptic post is more than a rallying cry for crypto fans. It follows a string of similar hints that led Strategy to pick up large chunks of Bitcoin at key price dips. Nothing Stops This Orange pic.twitter.com/NwtiXWl4MT — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 22, 2025 Based on history, traders and investors watch his every move. He’s built a reputation for turning a single line on social media into a multi-million-dollar acquisition. If past patterns hold, we could see the company locking in more BTC by mid-year. Lawsuit Accuses Execs Of Misleading Investors Last Friday, a shareholder filed a derivative suit in Virginia federal court. Abhey Parmar claims that Saylor, CEO Phong Le, CFO Andrew Kang and four board members failed in their duty. According to the complaint, they “made materially false and misleading statements” about a January accounting change. The suit says the team downplayed the impact and risk of Bitcoin’s wild price swings before the Q1 report. New Accounting Rule Triggers $6 Billion Loss Strategy adopted a Financial Accounting Standards Board rule that kicked in a month earlier. The switch let companies value crypto holdings at estimated market prices. It backfired for Strategy in April. The company recorded a $5.9 billion unrealized loss on Bitcoin, and its shares slid nearly 10% in the days after the results. Investors were caught off guard by how big the hit turned out to be. Insider Sales And Stock Recovery The lawsuit also highlights nearly $32 million in stock sales by top execs before the loss became public. Parmar argues those sales came while the share price was “artificially inflated.” Still, Strategy shares have clawed back most of their losses. They jumped from a low of just under $237 in early April to up to nearly 28% so far this year. That rebound shows many traders are still betting on Saylor’s long-term vision.

2025-06-23T12:00:08,"Bitcoin: Japan’s Metaplanet Makes Stunning Move, Amassing 11,111 BTC in Bold Corporate Treasury Strategy","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Japan’s Metaplanet Makes Stunning Move, Amassing 11,111 BTC in Bold Corporate Treasury Strategy Get ready for some exciting news from the land of the rising sun! A Japanese publicly listed company is making waves in the crypto world with a significant move that underscores a growing global trend. Metaplanet, a firm that has been increasingly vocal about its pivot towards a Bitcoin -first treasury strategy, just announced a major increase in its holdings, bringing its total stash to a rather symmetrical number. Metaplanet’s Latest Bold BTC Acquisition In a recent announcement shared via their official communication channels, Metaplanet confirmed a substantial addition to their Bitcoin reserves. The company acquired an additional 1,111 BTC. This isn’t just any purchase; it’s a move that significantly boosts their position and signals continued conviction in the digital asset. This latest BTC Acquisition is particularly noteworthy, not just for its size, but also for the round number it brings Metaplanet’s total holdings to. Following this purchase, Metaplanet now proudly holds a grand total of 11,111 BTC. For context, acquiring 1,111 BTC represents a significant capital allocation for any company, especially in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. It reflects a deliberate strategy to increase exposure to Bitcoin as a core component of their financial planning. Who is Metaplanet and Why the Focus on Japan Bitcoin? Metaplanet is a company that has been undergoing a transformation. While its original business activities might have been in different sectors, it has recently gained prominence specifically for its strategic shift towards accumulating Bitcoin . Think of them as Japan’s answer to companies like MicroStrategy, which have aggressively adopted Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset. Their focus on Japan Bitcoin isn’t just about being a Japanese company buying crypto. It highlights the increasing interest and potential for corporate adoption within Japan’s unique economic and regulatory environment. Japan has a well-established history with cryptocurrency, being one of the first countries to regulate exchanges. However, corporate adoption at this scale is still relatively new and highly impactful. Metaplanet’s strategy appears to be rooted in macroeconomics. With global currencies, including the Japanese Yen, facing inflationary pressures and potential devaluation concerns, companies are seeking alternative stores of value. Bitcoin , with its fixed supply and decentralized nature, presents itself as a potential hedge against these risks. By positioning themselves heavily in Bitcoin , Metaplanet is betting on its long-term appreciation and its ability to preserve capital in an uncertain economic climate. The Growing Trend of Corporate Treasury in BTC Metaplanet’s move isn’t happening in a vacuum. It’s part of a larger, evolving trend where companies are beginning to consider Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate component of their Corporate Treasury strategy. This shift was largely pioneered by US-based companies, but it’s now gaining traction globally, including in Asia. Why are companies looking at Corporate Treasury allocation in Bitcoin ? Several factors are driving this trend: Inflation Hedge: Traditional fiat currencies are subject to inflation, eroding purchasing power. Bitcoin’s capped supply makes it attractive as a potential hedge. Store of Value: Similar to gold, Bitcoin is seen by proponents as a digital store of value, capable of preserving wealth over time. Potential Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term growth potential compared to traditional assets or holding cash. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin can diversify a company’s balance sheet away from solely holding fiat currency or low-yield traditional assets. Attracting Talent/Innovation: For some tech-forward companies, embracing Bitcoin aligns with their brand and can attract employees and investors interested in the digital economy. Companies like MicroStrategy remain the most prominent example, holding tens of thousands of Bitcoin . Tesla also made a significant purchase, although they have adjusted their holdings over time. Metaplanet is now positioning itself among the significant corporate holders, particularly as a leader in the Japan Bitcoin space. Benefits and Challenges of a BTC Acquisition Strategy Adopting a BTC Acquisition strategy for a company’s treasury comes with both potential benefits and significant challenges. Potential Benefits: Capital Appreciation: The most obvious benefit if Bitcoin’s price increases. Balance Sheet Strength: A rising BTC price can significantly boost a company’s reported asset value. Hedge Against Currency Devaluation: Protection against the weakening of the local fiat currency (relevant for Metaplanet with the Yen). Increased Visibility and Investor Interest: Becoming a ‘ Bitcoin company’ can attract a specific type of investor. Challenges and Risks: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can swing dramatically, leading to potential impairment losses on the balance sheet (as per accounting rules). Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency is still evolving globally, which could impact holdings or the ability to transact. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss. Accounting Treatment: Accounting for Bitcoin can be complex, often treated as an intangible asset subject to impairment testing. Public Perception: Some stakeholders might view holding Bitcoin as too risky or speculative. Metaplanet’s decision to make such a large BTC Acquisition suggests they have weighed these factors and are comfortable with the risks, believing the long-term benefits outweigh them. Their strategy is a bold statement of confidence in Bitcoin as a future global reserve asset. Metaplanet’s Holdings: A Closer Look at 11,111 BTC The number 11,111 is visually striking and easy to remember. While perhaps coincidental, it adds a layer of symbolic interest to Metaplanet’s significant Bitcoin stack. At current market prices (which are constantly fluctuating), 11,111 BTC represents a substantial investment, likely valued in the hundreds of millions of US dollars. This places Metaplanet firmly on the map as a significant corporate holder of Bitcoin , especially within the Asian market. Their journey to 11,111 BTC wasn’t a single event. Metaplanet has been accumulating Bitcoin over time, demonstrating a phased approach to building their treasury position. This latest purchase of 1,111 BTC is a significant leap towards their stated goal of becoming a major Bitcoin -centric company. This level of commitment from a publicly traded Japanese company could serve as an example for other firms in Japan and across Asia who are watching the performance and strategy of early corporate adopters like Metaplanet. Implications for Japan’s Crypto Market and Beyond Metaplanet’s aggressive BTC Acquisition strategy has several potential implications: Validation for Bitcoin: A major publicly traded company in a G7 nation making Bitcoin a core treasury asset lends significant credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate financial asset. Encouragement for Other Japanese Firms: Metaplanet’s success (or challenges) with its strategy could influence other Japanese companies considering similar moves. Increased Institutional Interest: Large corporate buys contribute to the overall demand for Bitcoin and signal increasing institutional adoption. Focus on Japan’s Regulatory Environment: As more companies in Japan consider this path, it might put pressure on regulators to provide clearer guidance or frameworks for corporate crypto holdings. The move reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is transitioning from a niche retail investment to an asset class considered by sophisticated financial players and corporations looking to protect and grow their capital in the long term. Metaplanet is at the forefront of this shift in Japan. What Can We Learn? Actionable Insights Metaplanet’s journey offers several insights for investors and businesses alike: Conviction Matters: Metaplanet’s repeated and large purchases demonstrate high conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition, despite short-term volatility. Macroeconomic Drivers are Key: Their strategy is clearly linked to concerns about fiat currency stability and inflation. Understanding these macroeconomic factors is crucial when evaluating Bitcoin’s role. Corporate Adoption is a Growing Force: While still early, the trend of companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets is real and could be a significant demand driver over time. Japan is a Market to Watch: Metaplanet’s move puts the spotlight on Japan as a potential hub for corporate crypto adoption in Asia. Due Diligence is Essential: While Metaplanet is making bold moves, any company or individual considering a significant BTC Acquisition must conduct thorough due diligence on risks, security, and accounting. Metaplanet isn’t just buying Bitcoin ; they are adopting a strategic financial posture that is increasingly being explored by forward-thinking corporations globally. Summary: Metaplanet Solidifies its Position as a Japan Bitcoin Leader In conclusion, Metaplanet’s latest acquisition of 1,111 BTC, bringing their total holdings to 11,111 BTC, is a significant development. It underscores their unwavering commitment to a Bitcoin -centric Corporate Treasury strategy and positions them as a leading example of corporate BTC Acquisition in Japan. This move reflects a broader global trend of companies seeking hedges against macroeconomic uncertainty and recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a long-term store of value. As Metaplanet continues its journey, the market will be watching closely to see how this bold strategy unfolds and whether it inspires more Japanese and Asian companies to follow suit into the world of Japan Bitcoin .

2025-06-23T11:58:33,"Shiba Inu's V-Shaped Recovery Driven By Over 2T SHIB in Volume","Shiba Inu's SHIB v-shaped price recovery from 16-month lows is characterized by a surge in trading volumes, according to CoinDesk's AI research. The meme cryptocurrency has bounced to $0.0000$1080, having hit a low of $0.00001025 late Sunday. That was the lowest level since February 2024, according to data source TradingView. The bounce comes as bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value retook the $100,000 handle after oil's largely muted response to the U.S. airstrikes on Iran. SHIB's recovery appears sustainable, driven by a surge in trading volumes. According to CoinDesk's AI insights, buying pressure emerged late Sunday, with volume exceeding 2 trillion SHIB, more than double the 24-hour average. The subsequent bounce, represented by a series of higher lows and higher highs, ran into resistance near $0.00001088 during Monday's Asian trading hours. Key AI insights SHIB has recovered from a significant dip to $0.00001008, stabilizing around $0.00001081 with strong volume support during the recovery phase. Geopolitical tensions and trade disputes continue to influence cryptocurrency markets, with SHIB's price action forming a clear V-shaped recovery pattern. Volume spiked to nearly 8 trillion units during the 11:05 candle, indicating strong market participation. A double-top pattern formed at around $0.00001083, with significant selling pressure at this resistance level. Hourly chart SHIB's price has taken out the descending trendline, characterizing the sell-off from Friday. Prices, however, are yet to cross above the Ichimoku cloud, a momentum indicator.

2025-06-23T11:56:07,"Why is XRP Price Dropping?","The post Why is XRP Price Dropping? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The XRP price has dropped below $ 2 for the first time in over 12 weeks. In the last 24 hours alone, XRP slipped by 2% to $1.99, sparking concerns among investors and XRP enthusiasts. This 2.18% decline yesterday adds to a 7.93% drop since June 19, when XRP was priced at $2.17. At one point, XRP even touched $1.90, raising fears of a deeper correction. But experts suggest the problem isn’t with XRP itself. Why Did XRP Drop This Week? Analysts believe the XRP price fall isn’t about weak fundamentals but rather a result of broader market-wide pressure. According to Versan Aljarrah , co-founder of Black Swan Capitalist, the recent drop reflects overall market volatility, not a failure in XRP’s utility or use case. “XRP is simply following broader market sentiment,” he explained. Geopolitical Tensions Rock the Crypto Market The global crypto market is currently bearish . Over the last 24 hours, it has dropped by 2.6% , affecting nearly all major assets. Here’s a quick snapshot of this week’s top losers: Bitcoin: -4.9% Ethereum: -14% XRP: -8.3% Solana: -14.7% Dogecoin: -14% Cardano: -15.7% Sui & BCH: -20.3% each The Israel-Iran conflict is believed to be the main trigger. The Israel-Iran Conflict and Its Ripple Effects On June 22, the U.S. bombed three key Iranian nuclear sites, marking the most aggressive Western military action against Iran since 1979. In retaliation, Iran launched missiles at Israel and threatened U.S. bases in the Middle East. Iran’s parliament has also voted to shut down the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil passage. Oil Prices Surge – Crypto Takes a Hit The conflict has sent oil prices soaring: Brent Crude: +3% WTI Futures: 5-month high If oil prices climb to $100–$150 per barrel, as some analysts warn, it could lead to global inflation, lower liquidity, and a crypto sell-off. Rising energy costs also hurt Bitcoin mining profitability, adding further pressure to the market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Holders Are ‘Cosmic Royalty’ Leading a Global Financial Shift , Can XRP Bounce Back?

Supporters argue its real value lies in its utility, not market noise. Final Thoughts XRP’s fall below $2 may feel alarming, but market analysts urge caution. The decline appears to be part of a broader correction in the crypto market, driven by geopolitical and macroeconomic shocks. As always, short-term volatility doesn’t erase long-term potential—especially for utility-driven assets like XRP. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-23T11:45:03,"Trader Issues Warning to Bitcoin Top-Callers, Says BTC Still in Stage One Uptrend – Here’s What He Means","A closely followed crypto analyst believes that it’s very unlikely that Bitcoin ( BTC ) has already printed a bull market top at $110,000. In a new video update, crypto strategist Cheds tells his 49,800 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin’s long-term uptrend remains strong as the price of BTC trades above multiple moving averages on the weekly chart. According to the analyst, Bitcoin is just taking a breather after climbing from its 2025 low of around $74,000. “I think it’s hard to call a top here… How can you call a top? Look at this weekly chart. It’s by definition a stage one uptrend in a sense that it’s price above a rising EMA (exponential moving average) 8, and with this incredible price distance to a rising MA (moving average) 200, and a pretty good slope to the rising 200 as well. So there’s plenty of strength. There’s no way to call the top yet. We certainly know we’re consolidating.” Source: Cheds/YouTube In 2021, Bitcoin cratered after failing to take out the $69,000 level twice. The loss in bullish momentum triggered a bear market that sent BTC down to $16,000. For now, Cheds outlines levels to watch as Bitcoin consolidates. “$88,500 for me is the last level that needs to hold should $96,000 get tested and fail. And it’s a zone, not a number… Any kind of top now is not based on available information.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $101,957.

2025-06-23T11:45:00,"Unicoin to Buy Majority Stake in Diamond Lake, Will Launch Altcoin Treasury Strategy","Crypto firm Unicoin has agreed to buy a 51% stake in Diamond Lake Minerals, a firm specializing in digital assets, setting the stage for a strategic rebrand and a shift into altcoin treasury. The deal, which was announced on Monday, will see Diamond Lake Minerals renamed to DiamondLake and refocussed on building a cryptocurrency treasury business. That effort is inspired by Strategy’s bitcoin BTC-heavy corporate treasury strategy but swaps BTC for emerging altcoins. Shares of Diamond Lake Minerals’ were last trading at $3.96, suggesting the deal could be worth above $70 million. The acquisition is expected to close within 20 days, pending standard conditions. Unicoin CEO Alex Konanykhin framed the move as a bet on the future of cryptocurrencies. He cited legislative shifts like the recent passage of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act through the country’s Senate as catalysts that could unlock altcoin potential. ""We believe the same results achieved with Bitcoin can be replicated at a fraction of the cost in the alt-coin segment,” Konanykhin said. DiamondLake’s CEO Brian J. Esposito called the deal “historic,” emphasizing the company’s long-standing ambition to bring tokenization into the core of public market investment strategies. The new company will focus on tokenizing real-world assets and making them accessible to everyday investors. The acquisition comes roughly a month after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Unicorn and three of its executives, including Konanykhin, for allegedly raising over $100 million in a “massive securities fraud.” The agency claims Unicoin misled investors by inflating real estate valuations and promoting outsized, unrealistic returns, such as a 9 million percent gain, through aggressive marketing campaigns. The SEC is seeking disgorgement and civil penalties. Konanykhin has dismissed the charges as “blatantly false,” and suggested the SEC is still going after crypto firms, even after the regulator dropped cases against firms including Coinbase, Kraken, and Uniswap. He rejected a proposed settlement meeting in April, calling the SEC’s terms “unacceptable.” In a letter to shareholders, he argued that Unicoin had complied with U.S. regulations and accused the regulator of inflicting “multi-billion-dollar damages” through its probe.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/06/23/unicoin-to-buy-majority-stake-in-diamond-lake-will-launch-altcoin-treasury-strategy,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION","Finance|Unicoin|acquisition|Exclusive|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-23T11:44:14,"Why Is Crypto Down Today? – June 23, 2025","The crypto market is down today. Ten of the top 100 coins have seen increases over the past 24 hours. Moreover, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has decreased by 2.8% over the past day, now standing at $3.23 trillion, compared to Friday’s $3.37 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $161 billion, back to the typical levels. TL;DR: The crypto market has seen a notable drop over the weekend; BTC and ETH dropped around 1% over the past day each; At one point, BTC fell below the psychologically relevant $100,000 level; The probability of BTC ending 2025 above $200,000 has dropped to 3.5%; This is not over yet, analysts say, as market braces for instability; The market may experience additional hits. Crypto Winners & Losers All the top 10 coins per market cap are down today. Bitcoin (BTC) fell by 0.7%, now trading at $101,924, nearing the psychologically relevant $100,000 mark. This is also the smallest decrease in this category. Also, Ethereum (ETH) fell by 1%, changing hands at $2,251. This is the category’s second-smallest drop. XRP (XRP) saw the highest decrease in this category of 2.6% to the price of $2.02. Moreover, ten of the top 100 coins saw their prices increase in the same period. The best performer is Story (IP) , with the only double-digit increase of 11.6% to $3.06. At the same time, Filecoin (FIL) fell the most, followed by Toncoin (TON) . They’re down 3.9% and 3.8% to $2.12 and $2.75, respectively. Speaking of XRP, Bloomberg analysts recently placed the odds of an XRP spot ETF approval at 95% . The timing of these approvals/launches is more uncertain. Could be something we're talking about in the next month or two. Or it could be something that waits until October or later. Matter of when not if For Bloomberg clients, the note can be read here: https://t.co/PBdquFWPVn — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 20, 2025 Meanwhile, recent geopolitical shocks triggered immediate market reactions . Investors began moving into traditional safe-haven assets like gold and the US dollar. Bitcoin sold off all day & made up more than half of its losses in the last 30 minutes. Trump's announcement of direct US involvement in the Middle East marked the local bottom. pic.twitter.com/02Uxuqe21d — Joe Consorti (@JoeConsorti) June 22, 2025 This Isn’t Over: Market Braces for Instability Dr. Sean Dawson, Head of Research at decentralized onchain options AI-powered platform, Derive.xyz , commented that the surge in short-term implied volatility (IV) confirms the market is bracing for more instability. Volatility markets are telling us this isn’t over. “Amid mounting geopolitical pressure, we’re seeing classic risk-off behavior with falling prices, spiking volatility, and a pullback in upside positioning,” Dawson says. At one point, BTC has pulled back from $104,300 to $100,300. At the same time, there was also spike in short-term implied volatility by 10% to 45%. This happened as traders began pricing in fresh risk. Moreover, ETH plunged nearly 14% from $2,550 to $2,200, along with a 15-point jump in 7-day IV to 83%. This reflects increased downside hedging and uncertainty, Dawson says. “Ethereum’s double-digit loss and volatility spike to 83% show just how fast risk can unravel when leverage is high,” he adds. Source: Derive.xyz, Amberdata Without a clear de-escalation trigger, the company expects more cautious positioning and subdued momentum in the month ahead, the Head of Research notes. Dawson notes that the BTC options market is currently “scaling back on optimism.” The probability of BTC ending 2025 above $200,000 has dropped to 3.5%. The chance of it surpassing $150,000 in that same period fell to 11%. “Bulls are losing conviction as geopolitical risk and macro headwinds overshadow halving optimism and ETF flows.” At the same time, the likelihood of BTC closing below $80,000 remains unchanged at 20%. All these percentages “show the options market leaning defensive. Traders aren’t betting big on upside right now.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $101,924. At one point over the past day, the coin saw a sharp drop from the intraday high $102,739 and below the psychologically critical $100,000 mark to $98,467. It has recovered somewhat since. Over the past 7 days, we have seen a decrease of 4.5% from the intraweek high of $108,771. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView At the same time, Ethereum is currently trading at $2,251. The price saw a daily high of $2,280, falling to $2,134, before rising slightly to the current price. Over the past week, ETH fell 13.7% from the weekly high of $2,671. Moreover, the crypto market sentiment has entered fear territory. The Fear and Greed Index has dropped from 48 on Friday and 40 on Sunday to the current 37 . Now, fear is driving the prices potentially pushing them lower. But it can also present a chance to buy the dip. Source: CoinMarketCap Meanwhile, on 20 June, US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) until later today saw only $6.37 million in inflows. While BlackRock saw an inflow of $46.91 million, Fidelity recorded an outflow of $40.55 million.

The crypto market has seen a significant drop in a day, while the stock markets saw a mixed picture on their last day of trading. The S&P 500 went down by 0.22%, the Nasdaq-100 decreased by 0.43%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.083%. Investors were on edge over the Israel-Iran war and the US’s potential role. They were then surprised by the US attacks on Iran on Saturday, and this is bound to reflect on the stock market. Is this dip sustainable? Given the current geopolitical and economic developments, the prices may decrease further. Bitcoin may fall below $100,000 and ETH below $2,100.

2025-06-23T11:43:35,"SPX6900 Price Prediction: Traders Jump Ship as SPX Price Drops 37% in a Week, What’s Next?","The SPX6900 price has jumped by 8% today, with the altcoin’s move to $1.08 coming as the crypto market as a whole falls by 3% in the past 24 hours. Despite this increase, SPX6900 has fallen by 37% in the past week, as the wider market takes a big hit from the conflict in the Middle East . On the other hand, SPX remains up by 25% in a month and by a huge 9,900% in the past year, with the meme token only having set its current ATH of $1.73 some 12 days ago. It therefore continues to be one of the hot top-100 coins of the moment, with the coming weeks likely to bring further price increases as more investors plow into the token. SPX6900 Price Prediction: Traders Jump Ship as SPX Price Drops 37% in a Week, What’s Next? SPX’s chart looks very different from that of most other coins in the top 100, in that it has enjoyed a peak in the past couple of weeks, and not only in January, when Donald Trump took office. However, the flipside of this is that the coin entered a strongly overbought position, with its 37% drop in the past week providing a much-needed correction. Source: TradingView Indeed, SPX6900’s relative strength index (purple) has dropped to 40 this morning, which could be a prelude to a rebound. On the other hand, its MACD (orange, blue) has yet to return to its baseline or to become oversold, so it may be a few days before the token begins rallying again. But in the medium-term, SPX continues to look very promising, with its volumes still near their highest-ever levels, at around $100 million today. The meme token has been able to rise to new highs this month as a result of an influx of new investment, with major asset manager BlackRock being the most notable new investor in SPX . Open interest in the coin is also higher than it has been in every month prior to June , while its funding rate remains at a healthy 5.5%, indicating strong demand. This Cup & Handle pattern could make #SPX6900 go absolutely parabolic soon! pic.twitter.com/ghbhutWhXq — Coinvo (@ByCoinvo) June 21, 2025 And analysts are continuing to predict big things for the SPX6900 price in the coming weeks and months, with some highlighting a classic cup-and-handle pattern as a signal of an incoming breakout. Its fortunes in the next few days and weeks will depend on what happens in Iran, with a further escalation – such as the blocking of the Strait of Hormuz – likely to depress demand in the near term. However, if conditions settle, SPX could easily reach $1.25 by the end of July and $1.50 by the end of August. Bitcoin Bull Raises $7.3 Million in Snowballing Presale: Is Deflationary Meme Coin Ready to Explode? As good as SPX looks at the moment, it won’t be the only new token to do well this summer, particularly if market conditions (e.g. tariffs, Middle East) improve. There are also other, newer coins ready to surge in the coming weeks, including several presale tokens that have been building strong momentum recently. One of these is Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL), a deflationary ERC-20 token that has now raised $7.3 million in its ongoing ICO. Last chance to buy BTCBULL before launch! The countdown ends on June 30th. Here’s what’s coming: BTCBULL token burns BTC airdrops at price milestones BTCBULL airdrop when Bitcoin hits $250K Join the herd: https://t.co/FQZXEzFwWu pic.twitter.com/aeUmLJcSOC — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) June 2, 2025 What’s exciting about Bitcoin Bull is that its deflationary tokenomics are connected to Bitcoin’s (BTC) performance. With a hard cap of 21 billion BTCBULL, the token will conduct burns whenever BTC reaches price milestones for the first time. This will begin with $125,000, and repeat with each additional $25,000 added for the first time, shrinking BTCBULL’s supply in the long run. Not only that, but Bitcoin Bull will host airdrops of Bitcoin itself, with these happening whenever BTC adds $50,000 to its price for the time (starting with $150,000). This could make BTCBULL hugely profitable to hold, particularly when owners can stake it for a passive income. However, the coin’s presale will end in just under seven days, so investors will have to move quickly if they want to buy the token before it lists. They can do so by going to the Bitcoin Bull website , where BTCBULL is selling at its final presale price of $0.00258.

2025-06-23T11:42:43,"Ethereum Price Prediction As ETH Continues to Fall Behind Bitcoin in June 2025","Ethereum (ETH) has gone down by 14.5% in the past week as rising tensions in the Middle East have sparked a strong sell-off that has now pushed the token to the low 2,000s. The United States bombed nuclear enrichment facilities in Iran during the weekend and a new chapter in this armed conflict between Israel and Iran began as a result. The market was spooked by the news and a downward move that started on Wednesday accelerated during the weekend, pushing ETH from nearly $2,900 to its current level of $2,260. Bitcoin (BTC) has been increasing its dominance in the crypto market as investors have rotated their capital out of altcoins amid the uncertainty and volatility triggered by these events. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that BTC’s dominance has been steadily increasing in the past year, moving from 54.1% in June 2024 to 64% as of today. As a result, ETH’s dominance has stepped back from 18.2% to 8%. It appears that investors continue to see Bitcoin as the safer bet of all in the crypto market, which favors a bearish Ethereum price prediction. Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Could Drop to $1,800 if It Fails to Recapture These Levels Looking at the 4-hour chart, we can see that ETH has broken below two key supports already, the first at $2,380 and the second at $2,320. The token has now stepped out of consolidation as a result of this bearish breakout and could be heading to retest the $1,800 shortly as the uptrend has now been reversed. Momentum indicators have improved slightly as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has stepped out of oversold territory for the time being and has moved above the 14-period moving average. It is still too early to say that this is the end of the downtrend. What this improvement could mean in the near term is that ETH will retest these support levels from below and could then resume its downward momentum after it raises enough buy-side liquidity. As Bitcoin’s dominance continues to increase, all crypto presales associated with the top crypto stand to reap the benefits of its positive performance. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) has emerged as one of the most promising new presales as the project is raising the necessary capital to launch a layer-2 scaling solution for the Bitcoin network that unlocks the untapped potential of its DeFi ecosystem and more. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) Keeps Surpasses $1.5M Raised to Launch its L2 Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) leverages the efficiency of the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to unlock the potential of the Bitcoin network to become the home of the market’s most successful decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. The project creates a scalable Solana-based side chain that bundles transactions offline before sending them to the Bitcoin mainnet and provides near-instant finality. As a result, developers will be able to create efficient dApps for DeFi services like lending and borrowing and yield farming, create low-cost payment platforms that use BTC as their main token, and interfaces through which users can mint meme coins on the Bitcoin blockchain. The demand for $HYPER will explode once the solution is embraced by top wallets and exchanges. Hence, at its discounted presale price of $0.012, this token offers significant upside potential to early buyers. To buy $HYPER, simply head to the Bitcoin Hyper website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to invest.

2025-06-23T11:40:25,"Ether's Leverage-Driven Rally Faces Breakdown Risk, Matrixport Warns","Ether’s ETH recent rally may be on shaky ground with one firm warning that last week’s price surge was largely fueled by speculative futures positions instead of a bump in organic demand. In a note on Monday, Matrixport opined that “leveraged traders have pushed [ETH’s] price higher in the absence of fundamental support,” adding that this made the asset more susceptible to the “outsized decline” the asset saw over the weekend. Ether slumped over 8% in a Saturday sell-off, leading losses among majors as traders reacted to the U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear sites in a surprise airstrike. The firm pointed to last week’s sharp drop in ETH as evidence of this position-driven fragility and warned that elevated leverage levels could continue to pressure prices. At press time, ETH traded near $2,248 — down from last week’s high above $2,400 — as derivatives data showed traders aggressively hedging downside risk. Options market signals echo that caution, as CoinDesk analyst Omkar Godbole noted over the weekend . According to data from Amberdata, ETH’s 25-delta risk reversals — a measure comparing the cost of puts versus calls — have skewed negative across June to July expiries. This suggests investors are paying up for protection against downside volatility. QCP Capital further noted in a weekend market update that “risk reversals in both BTC and ETH continue to show a preference for downside protection,” adding that long holders are actively hedging their spot exposure.

2025-06-23T11:40:15,"Abraxas Capital Reveals Astounding $79.92M Unrealized Profit from Crypto Shorts","BitcoinWorld Abraxas Capital Reveals Astounding $79.92M Unrealized Profit from Crypto Shorts In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency trading, uncovering the strategies of major players can provide valuable insights. Recent on-chain data analysis has shed light on the significant activities of investment manager Abraxas Capital , revealing a substantial position in the market that has resulted in considerable gains. This firm appears to be capitalizing on bearish sentiment through carefully constructed trades. What Are Crypto Short Positions and Why Do They Matter? Before diving into the specifics of Abraxas Capital’s holdings, let’s clarify what a short position is in the context of cryptocurrency. Essentially, short selling is a trading strategy where an investor borrows an asset (like BTC or ETH) and sells it on the open market, with the intention of buying it back later at a lower price. The difference between the selling price and the repurchase price is the profit, minus any fees. Why would a firm take crypto short positions ? Typically, this strategy is employed when an investor believes the price of an asset is likely to fall. It’s a way to profit from a declining market. Unlike simply holding assets (going long), shorting involves borrowing, which introduces complexities and risks, especially when leverage is involved. Abraxas Capital ‘s Strategy Revealed by On-Chain Data According to insights from on-chain analyst The Data Nerd, shared on the social media platform X, two specific addresses have been identified as belonging to Abraxas Capital . These addresses are currently holding leveraged short positions across several prominent and emerging cryptocurrencies. The use of on-chain data allows observers to peer into the transactions and holdings of large market participants, offering transparency that isn’t always available in traditional finance. The analysis points to leverage ranging between 5x and 10x on these positions. Leverage magnifies both potential profits and potential losses. A 5x leverage means that for every 1% drop in the asset’s price, the short position gains 5% (before fees). Conversely, a 1% rise could lead to a 5% loss on the initial margin. This high degree of leverage indicates a strong conviction in the downward price movement of the targeted assets. Breaking Down the Assets: Bitcoin Short , Ethereum Short , and Others Abraxas Capital’s portfolio of short positions isn’t limited to just one or two assets. The firm has diversified its bearish bets across several cryptocurrencies, including: Bitcoin (BTC): As the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, a Bitcoin short position is a direct bet against the broader market sentiment. Ethereum (ETH): The second-largest crypto, an Ethereum short targets the extensive DeFi and NFT ecosystems built on its blockchain. Solana (SOL): A high-throughput blockchain often seen as a competitor to Ethereum. SUI (SUI): A relatively newer Layer 1 blockchain project. HYPE (HYPE): (Note: The specific asset ‘HYPE’ might refer to a less common or meme-coin asset. On-chain data accuracy relies on correct identification). This mix of established giants like BTC and ETH, alongside newer chains like SOL and SUI, suggests a strategy that isn’t solely focused on the top market cap assets but also includes bets on potential downturns in newer ecosystems. Understanding Unrealized Crypto Profit : What Does $79.92M Mean? The headline figure is the approximately $79.92 million in total unrealized crypto profit . What does ‘unrealized’ mean in this context? It signifies the profit that exists on paper based on the current market price of the assets since the short positions were opened. However, this profit has not yet been locked in because the positions are still open. The firm has not yet bought back the borrowed assets to close the shorts. This $79.92 million represents the potential gain if Abraxas Capital were to close all these leveraged short positions at the current market prices. It’s a substantial figure, highlighting the scale of their trading activity and the extent of the price drops in these assets since they initiated their shorts. However, it’s crucial to remember that this profit can fluctuate with market movements until the positions are closed. The Mechanics of Leverage: Amplifying Gains and Risks The 5x-10x leverage applied to these positions significantly amplifies the potential outcome. Leverage allows traders to control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital (margin). If the market moves favorably (prices drop for short positions), the returns on the initial margin can be very high. However, if the market moves unfavorably (prices rise), the losses are also magnified, and the position can face liquidation if the losses exceed the margin collateral. For example, a 10x leveraged short on BTC means that a 10% increase in BTC price could wipe out the entire margin used for that position, leading to liquidation. Managing leverage is a critical aspect of risk management in trading, especially with volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Why This Matters: Implications for the Market The revelation of a major investment firm like Abraxas Capital holding such large, profitable crypto short positions offers several insights: Institutional Sentiment: It suggests that at least some institutional players foresaw or are betting on continued downward price action in these specific assets or the broader market. Market Impact: While not necessarily the sole driver, large short positions can contribute to selling pressure if they are actively managed or scaled. On-Chain Data Value: This case underscores the power of on-chain analysis in providing transparency into the activities of large market participants, offering valuable data points for other traders and analysts. Challenges and Risks of Shorting Despite the reported unrealized crypto profit , holding leveraged short positions is not without significant risks: Liquidation Risk: As mentioned, adverse price movements can lead to rapid liquidation of the position, resulting in substantial losses. Unlimited Loss Potential: Theoretically, if an asset’s price keeps rising, the potential loss on a short position is unlimited (though leverage mechanisms on exchanges often include liquidation to prevent this). Funding Costs: Holding short positions on leveraged platforms often incurs periodic funding fees. Market Volatility: Crypto markets are known for sudden, sharp price swings that can quickly turn a profitable position into a losing one. Actionable Insights from On-Chain Analysis The ability to track the positions of entities like Abraxas Capital through on-chain data provides a powerful tool. While not financial advice, observing where large players are placing their bets (long or short) can inform individual trading strategies or provide a pulse on institutional sentiment. It highlights the growing sophistication of market analysis using publicly available blockchain data. Summary: A Glimpse into Institutional Bearish Bets The reported $79.92 million in unrealized crypto profit from Abraxas Capital ‘s leveraged crypto short positions across assets like BTC, ETH, SOL, SUI, and HYPE offers a fascinating look into how institutional investors are navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market. While this figure represents potential profit that is subject to market fluctuations until realized, it underscores the scale of their bearish bets and the power of leverage. This case also serves as a prime example of how on-chain data analysis is becoming an indispensable tool for understanding market dynamics and the strategies of major participants, including those taking significant Bitcoin short and Ethereum short positions.

2025-06-23T11:37:32,"Bitcoin Market Faces Sharp Deleveraging as Investors Exit Risk Positions","After plunging to $98,000, Bitcoin’s price has staged a recovery, climbing back to levels above $100,000. There has also been a dramatic drop in the Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR), which highlighted a significant investor exit from risk amid increased geopolitical tensions. In fact, the ELR plunged to -0.25 within just three days, levels not seen since the aftermath of China’s 2021 crypto mining ban, when it hit -0.35, but over a longer period of one month. Traders Flee Risk Amid Uncertainty According to CryptoQuant’s analysis , this sharp and rapid decline signals a wave of deleveraging, where both forced liquidations and voluntary position closures have reduced Open Interest across derivatives markets. The immediate catalyst appears to be the escalating conflict between the US and Iran, which has injected a fresh wave of uncertainty into already fragile markets. Such a swift ELR contraction means that market participants are aggressively pulling back from risk, as they anticipate further volatility. While this trend reflects short-term caution, CryptoQuant suggests that panic-driven selloffs may also create strategic opportunities for longer-term investors. Despite this, the current environment is one of rising unpredictability, and leveraged trades now come with amplified risk. This phase matches historical stress points and is indicative of a market recalibration that could either stabilize with time or descend further depending on macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. Bitcoin’s Bull Cycle May Still Be Intact Even as the market struggles amidst volatility, on-chain data shows that long-term holders remain resilient, choosing to hold rather than sell. One key indicator, the Binary CDD 30-day moving average, has stayed below the critical 0.8 threshold and peaked instead at around 0.6 before beginning to decline. This behavior essentially means that long-term investors are not actively moving or spending older coins. The absence of high CDD activity implies that seasoned holders still expect further upside. While some cooling is evident, especially after a period of aggressive price action, the lack of major distribution from long-term wallets hints that the bull cycle remains intact. As in past cycles, Bitcoin often climbs higher in a “staircase” pattern – pausing, consolidating, then rallying further. The muted on-chain activity and subdued sentiment could, counterintuitively, set the stage for the next leg up, as history shows Bitcoin tends to rally hardest when few are paying attention.
