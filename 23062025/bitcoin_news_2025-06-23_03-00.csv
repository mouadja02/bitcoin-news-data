The Wyoming Stable Token Commission (WYST) is a proposed virtual currency representative of and redeemable for one US dollar held in a trust by the state of Wyoming. In a post on the social media platform X, Aptos says that the state is looking to use either chain with Layer Zero infrastructure to deploy a potential stablecoin. “The Wyoming Stable Token Commission has placed Aptos as the highest-scoring blockchain candidate for WYST – the first fiat-backed stablecoin issued by a US State – tying for 1st place with Solana. WYST will be deployed using Layer Zero… Aptos is making borderless, always-on finance a reality today with three native USD stablecoins & $30 billion+ in monthly stablecoin volume, supported by sub-second finality and near-zero transaction fees at [around] $0.00055. Following the recent passing of the GENIUS Act to establish the first regulatory framework for stablecoins and Aptos pushing further as the chain for stablecoins, the future of finance is here on Aptos.” Last year, Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon said he would push for the adoption of a “transparent” stablecoin fully backed by the state’s short-term Treasury holdings. “One of the big things for me is to be able to bring back onshore a lot of our debt because if it’s bought by treasuries and supported by Treasurys, it will help to stabilize that market to a degree… [What] is clear to me is that digital assets are going to have a future.

2025-06-22T22:00:48,"Successful Audit and Holders Hype Might Make Ruvi AI (RUVI) The Next $1 Project, Can It Mimic Bitcoin’s (BTC) Rise?","Bitcoin (BTC) has long been the benchmark of success in the cryptocurrency space, soaring from under $1 to tens of thousands of dollars over its history. But today, analysts are turning their gaze toward Ruvi AI (RUVI) , a rising crypto powered by blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) . With a structured growth model and a fast-growing community, Ruvi AI is inching closer to becoming the next $1 project. Could it replicate Bitcoin’s meteoric rise? Why Ruvi AI Is Emerging as a $1 Contender While Bitcoin built its empire on its scarcity and decentralized technology, Ruvi AI offers pragmatic utility by solving pressing challenges in marketing , entertainment , and finance. Combining AI and blockchain, Ruvi AI delivers real-world value rather than relying solely on market sentiment or speculative demand.

Once the presale ends, the token’s price will increase to $0.07 , representing an almost 5x ROI before public trading begins. Analysts project that RUVI could go further, reaching $1 post-listing , a 66x ROI for those who invest early. This calculated growth puts Ruvi AI ahead of its competitors in terms of predictability and potential returns. A Presale That Signals Strong Momentum Ruvi AI’s presale performance has demonstrated remarkable momentum, confirming its appeal to investors. Key measurable highlights include: Over $1.9 million raised so far More than 160 million tokens sold , showing strong demand Over 1,600 token holders , underscoring a solid and growing community Importantly, the post-presale valuation of $0.07 is not speculative hype but rather a part of Ruvi AI’s structured pricing strategy.

2025-06-22T21:45:55,"Coinbase CEO Says the World Needs Crypto Now More Than Ever","Coinbase, a leading digital currency platform, has made a strong statement about the future of global finance. The company believes crypto can help solve key problems in today’s financial system, such as rising debt, inflation, and growing distrust in banks. According to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, digital currencies like Bitcoin (BTC) are not just new forms of money. They are tools that can help build a stronger, fairer economy. Global Debt and Inflation Are Rising In a post on X, the Coinbase CEO highlighted serious problems in the global economy. Government debt is rising quickly, especially in the U.S., where the national debt has now reached over $36 trillion. At the same time, inflation makes money worth less and everyday costs higher. This makes it harder for people to save, invest, or plan. Armstrong said these issues are reducing economic freedom and trust in banks. Bitcoin and Digital Currencies Offer a New Option In response to these problems, more people are turning to digital assets like Bitcoin. Coinbase CEO says the rising price of the flagship crypto shows that people are looking for safer alternatives. These assets are becoming a place to protect wealth from inflation and government overspending. Unlike traditional money, crypto can be sent quickly and cheaply across borders. It does not rely on central banks or large financial firms. This gives people more control over their money, especially in places with weak banking systems or unstable currencies. Many crypto leaders have also suggested using Bitcoin to reduce the U.S. national debt. In February, a new report from VanEck, an investment management firm, shed light on whether this plan is feasible . Crypto Is Not Just About Investment The Coinbase leader explained that crypto is more than a way to make money. It is a technology that can improve the financial system. It can speed up payments, lower fees, and support new business ways. Artists and creators can earn income directly from their audience without giving a significant share to middlemen. Armstrong said Coinbase is building new tools to make this possible. These include simple business payment systems and a crypto card that rewards users in Bitcoin . Coinbase aims to make crypto valuable in everyday life, not just as an investment but as a practical solution for modern finance. Coinbase is Building A New Foundation for the Financial System According to Coinbase, the world needs to rebuild its financial system from the ground up. The company believes crypto can be the foundation for this change. Under the leadership of its CEO, Coinbase is expanding its role from a trading platform to a complete financial services provider. It now supports various digital tools and wants to help build the next generation of internet-based financial systems.

2025-06-22T21:26:07,"Long-Awaited Good News for Bitcoin Comes from Texas","Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed into law Bill SB 21, adding Bitcoin reserves to the state’s legal framework. With this move, Texas has become the third state in the US to create an official Bitcoin reserve. According to the Bitcoin Laws platform, which tracks digital asset laws, 47 strategic Bitcoin reserve bills have been introduced in 26 states so far, with 13 bills under active consideration at the federal level. This growing interest in digital asset reserves across the country parallels the policies of Donald Trump, who was re-elected in November 2024. Trump, who took office in January, has taken extensive steps to transform the U.S. into a more crypto-friendly environment, including reversing anti-crypto banking practices (debanking), appointing pro-crypto figures to key regulatory positions, and establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Related News: Developers Sent a Large Amount of Tokens to Binance in This Altcoin - They Have Done This 11 Times in the Past, Here's What to Expect Trump signed an executive order on March 7, 2025, titled “Establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile,” formalizing the idea of a Bitcoin-only reserve. The order also defined a “Digital Asset Stockpile,” which would include other digital assets such as XRP, SOL, and ADA.

2025-06-22T21:00:56,"Texas Signs Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Into Law – Details","In a major development, the Texas State Government has officially signed a strategic Bitcoin reserve into law thereby diversifying its financial investment strategy. Following this event, Texas officially became the third US State to own a Bitcoin reserve fund under five months of the pro-crypto Donald Trump administration. Texas To Run Treasury-Independent Bitcoin Reserve On June 20, Texas State Governor Gregg Abbot officially enacted SB 21 , which proposed the formation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the purpose of investing in the digital asset market. The bill, now law and authored by Senator Charles Schwertner states the proposed Bitcoin reserve is to exist outside the state treasury but still under the investment authority of the comptroller of public accounts. Furthermore, the reserve is allowed to hold Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as dictated by the comptroller. However, only cryptocurrencies with an average market capitalization of $500 billion over a 12-month period can be logged into the reserve effectively limiting entry to Bitcoin ($2.07 trillion) and perhaps Ethereum ($272.3 billion) in the coming years. Meanwhile, all investments of the reserve into the state treasury requires authorization by the legislature via the general appropriations act or another law. However, the comptroller is allowed to withdraw Bitcoin or spend the net proceeds from asset sales to cover all costs involved in managing the reserve. Alongside SB 21, Governor Abbott also signed HB 4488 , a separate bill that prevents the strategic Bitcoin reserve and other certain state funds from undergoing a periodic treasury fund sweep while ensuring the reserve’s legal existence even if no Bitcoin has been purchased by summer 2026. The State Bitcoin Reserve Race On March 6, US President Donald Trump signed a federal strategic Bitcoin reserve into law encouraging states to explore the premier cryptocurrency as an investment tool. As earlier stated, Texas is the third US state now operating a strategic Bitcoin reserve after Arizona and New Hampshire. According to data from Bitcoin Laws , there are currently five other states looking to join the pack with a proposed legislative bill still under review. These states include Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, Rhodes Island, and Massachusetts.Meanwhile, efforts in states like Oklahoma, Florida, and Georgia, among others, have faced significant setbacks, with proposed Bitcoin reserve bills either stalled or formally repealed due to legislative or political roadblocks. At press time, Bitcoin continues to trade at $102,650 following a 2.74% decline in the past week.

2025-06-22T20:52:38,"Bitcoin Price Warnings Emerge, Stablecoins Score Regulatory Win: Binance Weekly Report","This week, the cryptocurrency space recorded a major win in the stablecoin sector despite geopolitical headwinds keeping markets in a risk-off stance. However, bitcoin (BTC) continued to consolidate until Friday before it plummeted due to tensions between Israel and Iran. A weekly report by the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, revealed that global markets have faced heightened volatility since the beginning of the week. The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady, but investors sold off their risk assets, including BTC and equities, as they sought safety. Bitcoin Consolidates Bitcoin and equities started the week with a rally, shrugging off the negative sentiment brought by geopolitical headlines. By mid-week, BTC retraced its steps and fell to $103,500, and investors moved to defensive assets as fears of a deeper Middle East geopolitical spillover resurfaced. The flight-to-safety trend was not just witnessed in bitcoin; ether and other large-cap altcoins saw similar moves. While investors moved from a risk-on to risk-off approach, Binance analysts found that structural demand for BTC remained resilient. The United States spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) market saw inflows totaling $2.4 billion across an eight-day streak that extended till June 18. The exchange said this was a sign of “dip-buying” by long-term investors. Spot Ethereum ETFs also saw notable positive flows, surpassing $605 million during the same period. In addition, on-chain metrics for Ethereum remained positive, with staked ether (ETH) surging to a record 34.9 million ETH, accounting for roughly 28.9% of the circulating supply. Analysts discovered that more than 500,000 ETH of the staked amount was added in the first two weeks of June. “This points to rising conviction in ETH’s yield potential and network security while further reducing liquid supply,” Binance stated. U.S. Senate Passes Stablecoin Bill On the regulatory front, the U.S. Senate passed the landmark Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act in a 68–30 vote on June 17. The bill is the first comprehensive regulatory framework for fully-reserved, anti-money laundering (AML)-compliant stablecoins. The next step for the GENIUS Act is to pass the House of Representatives before it can become law. Although the bill marks a major step forward for stablecoin regulation, it has raised concerns about the concentration of risk within the traditional banking system. This is because the Act mandates that stablecoin reserves be held by only federally regulated entities. Meanwhile, the policy win comes as stablecoin usage reaches record highs: the total supply has grown 22.5% since 2024 ended to exceed $250 billion, and on-chain transfer volumes have surpassed $20 trillion.

2025-06-22T20:39:55,"Best Crypto to Invest In As Whale Wallets Buy The World War III Fear","Global markets are sliding under the weight of conflict, with the United States now striking Iranian nuclear complexes while fighting spreads across the Middle East. Oil jumps and equities retreat in predictable lockstep, yet crypto moves with massive volatility. However, giant wallets that already command thousands of coins continue to absorb supply without pause. On-chain dashboards record week after week of inflows, highlighting purposeful accumulation rather than reflex trading. That quiet conviction is catching attention on retail message boards, where disbelief is giving way to curiosity. Many smaller traders now wonder whether disciplined buying by deep pockets is sketching the timeline for the next rally in both spot and derivatives venues, even while stocks bleed across benchmarks globally. Whales Double Down While War Intensifies Globally Look first at the wallets that set the tone. Michael Saylor, whose MicroStrategy pile rivals the treasuries of small nations, tweeted that fresh coins will reach the corporate vault on Monday, extending a buying streak that has barely paused all year. If the order executes at recent prices, the firm will cross the line of one point one percent of all Bitcoin ever to circulate. pic.twitter.com/wu9mMkxtUg — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 21, 2025 Saylor frames each purchase as insurance against sovereign muddles, and the weekend events lend weight to that view. Former President Donald Trump confirmed strikes on the Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan nuclear sites, a confrontation that rocked commodity charts but left Bitcoin liquidity deep and calm. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has been correcting and has seen a drop to the lower $101,000 levels, but then again, the buying activity from top investors globally seems to paint a different picture on the macro level. 🇸🇻 Update: El Salvador has boosted its Bitcoin stash by 8 BTC this week, pushing its total reserves to 6,215 BTC. pic.twitter.com/5hFTxa6UR6 — Crypto Jessica (@CryptoJessXBT) June 22, 2025 El Salvador chose the same moment to add eight more coins, lifting the national hoard to 6,215. The country’s average entry price now sits in the green, a detail officials celebrated by posting a profit tracker on social media. Institutional desks are reading the tape in similar fashion across major trading hubs worldwide. Trump Media filed for a fund that would hold Bitcoin and Ether, joining a queue of issuers now stretching out the door. Bloomberg data shows approval odds above 90% , and betting markets give Solana an even stronger shot at a green light before year-end. Seven managers have revised their Solana filings to include staking rewards, signalling an arms race to capture yield-hungry flows. As regulators inch toward clarity, heavy wallets treat volatility as a clearance sale rather than a threat. Naturally, these developments have created a sense of interest and intrigue among smaller investors now as well, who now speculate the crypto space to see another major rally once the war situation settles a bit and the purchases made by these top institutional buyers start to turn profitable. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Coins that Could Pump As Bitcoin Recovers BTC Bull BTC Bull is designed to turn every major Bitcoin milestone into a celebration for its holders. As the first official meme coin built entirely around Bitcoin’s rise, it goes far beyond the usual hype. It’s a structured reward engine built on Ethereum. Every time Bitcoin crosses a $25,000 price increment, BTC Bull triggers either a token burn or a BTC airdrop. When Bitcoin climbed from $75,000 to $100,000, a massive burn event permanently removed a portion of the $BTCBULL supply, tightening scarcity and energizing demand. The next milestone, $125,000, is already circled by the community. But the real prize lies at $250,000. A massive airdrop of actual Bitcoin awaits holders, weighted by both their token balance and the size of their Community Sale purchase. This means the earlier you joined and the more you held, the bigger your reward when Bitcoin hits that level. Smaller milestone rewards have already begun, with airdrops in wrapped BTC sent to loyal wallets every time the market breaks higher. Jacob Crypto Bury speculates BTCBULL to be a 100x crypto once it launches, which also adds to its growing popularity and demand further. Beyond the milestone mechanics, BTC Bull also features a secure staking contract with high APY options for those who want to lock in their tokens. While others chase volatility, stakers here quietly collect ongoing rewards with every block. The meme coin aspect draws attention, but underneath it is a model engineered for serious engagement. It’s a project that ties its entire incentive system to Bitcoin’s trajectory, offering utility that doesn’t just ride popularity, but mirrors Bitcoin’s actual momentum, one milestone at a time.

Video, audio, image, or text, every entry lives in decentralized storage with an access key issued only after a signed transaction. Because the escrow is autonomous, there are no chargebacks or surprise fees. That reliability has drawn established influencers who were losing income to fraud and geographical bank limits. Platform revenue arrives continuously rather than at the end of a pay cycle, which smooths cash flow and allows creators to plan production schedules with confidence. The token earns utility on both sides of the table. Fans who stake SUBBD receive loyalty boosts that lower future subscription costs and unlock exclusive polls or community calls. Meanwhile, part of every transaction fee routes to a buy and burn vault, compressing float as daily activity climbs. Network burn rate already outpaces new token emissions, which has turned the asset into a deflationary ticket. This architecture matters during wartime volatility because payment processors often suspend regions, yet the SUBBD rail remains open so global audiences stay connected to their favorite voices. With privacy, instant settlement, and a shrinking supply all built in, the project presents a secure, resilient gateway for content economies that need income certainty when wider markets wobble. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper introduces a Layer 2 experience for Bitcoin by stitching the asset to a Solana Virtual Machine environment that carries throughput in the thousands of transactions per second. The bridge starts on the base chain where a canonical address collects deposits. Relay contracts then confirm block headers and transactions in cryptographic proofs. When verification clears, wrapped BTC appears inside the Hyper ledger with finality measured in seconds and fees that sit comfortably below one cent. Transaction data does not bloat the network. Instead, an aggregator condenses blocks into concise bundles, generates a zero-knowledge proof, and posts the result back to Bitcoin for settlement. Security remains anchored to proof of work while performance rivals the fastest smart contract networks. Because the bridge is trustless, traders can enter and exit without surrendering custody. The HYPER token energizes every layer of the system. Holders stake to earn up to 509% APY during the ongoing presale, a rate funded by an allocation that reserves 15% of supply for community incentives. Additional slices distribute as 30% for development, 25% for the treasury, 20% for marketing, and 10% for exchange liquidity. Early demand is clear, with more than $1.5 million collected to date. By bringing cost-efficient settlement, rapid execution, and compatibility with Solana tooling, Bitcoin Hyper converts Bitcoin from a passive store of value into a platform ready for decentralized finance, gaming, and daily payments. Investors looking for infrastructure that tracks Bitcoin growth while adding real utility may find the proposition compelling. Best Wallet Token Best Wallet Token is not just a governance asset but a native fuel for one of the most ambitious self-custody rollouts in the retail crypto space. Built around a non-custodial wallet with deep integrations into swaps, dApps, and cross-chain analytics, the token plays a central role in user onboarding and platform activity. Holders receive perks such as zero-fee swaps, priority access to new token listings, and rebates in the form of BEST every time they perform wallet actions like bridging or staking. This encourages engagement and builds velocity in the ecosystem, particularly useful during times of heightened volatility when users demand direct control over their funds. In the current market, where exchanges can freeze assets due to regulatory shifts or political events, a secure and feature-rich wallet becomes critical infrastructure. Best Wallet leans into that by offering not just basic storage but real-time insights into on-chain activity and wallet-to-wallet alerts that notify users when major transactions occur from flagged or high-net-worth addresses. This layer of intelligence turns the wallet into a trading terminal, not just a vault. A percentage of all platform fees goes toward scheduled token burns, which have so far removed millions of BEST from circulation. With a deflationary supply, ongoing utility, and increasing wallet downloads since Q2, the token is gaining traction both as a store of platform value and a real-time reward instrument. As more institutional buyers turn to on-chain tools during uncertain times, BEST sits at the intersection of functionality, transparency, and adaptive rewards. Conclusion In a market defined by fear, the smartest capital is still buying. Whale wallets, corporate treasuries, and nation-state portfolios are moving with intent, not hesitation. That kind of activity is rarely casual. It signals a belief that the current chaos is not the end of a cycle but the beginning of a new phase. And while headlines may rattle weaker hands, the chain tells a clearer story—capital is positioning for something larger. For investors watching from the sidelines, this may be the time to look closer at assets designed not just to ride the next rally, but to benefit directly from the mechanics driving it. Some of them are already rewarding those who act early. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

2025-06-22T20:15:30,"Garden Finance Accused of Aiding $1.4B Crypto Laundering Scheme","Blockchain researcher ZachXBT has accused Garden Finance of helping to launder funds stolen in the massive $1.4 billion Bybit hack. The decentralized crypto swapping platform recently reported strong growth numbers. However, critics believe much of that activity may involve suspicious or criminal transactions. Garden Reports Busy Activity in Q2 2025 In its Q2 2025 report, Garden Finance shared data from Dune Analytics showing high transaction activity. The platform handled nearly 24,984 Bitcoin (BTC) in swaps, worth over $1.5 billion, across 40,571 atomic swaps. It also earned 40.11 BTC in fees, with one manual swap reaching a volume of 10 BTC. While these numbers were meant to highlight success, they quickly drew criticism. ZachXBT questioned the source of these high volumes and fees. He claimed over 80% of the platform’s earnings may have come from laundering stolen assets. He said Chinese agents linked to the North Korean Lazarus Group used Garden Finance to move the stolen funds. Garden Finance Response Stirred Controversy In response, Garden Finance executive Jax Gulati pointed to a past update from Q4 2024. He said the platform held only 30 BTC at the time of the Bybit hack and denied that it was centralized or pretending to be decentralized. Nevertheless, ZachXBT was not convinced. He mentioned other hacks, like the one on WazirX, to show a pattern. He claimed the same group kept using Garden Finance, raising concerns about who uses the platform and how it is being monitored. Further fueling the debate, a user named James Scaur commented on the nature of liquidity flow on Garden Finance. He said the reason one user seemed to control most of the liquidity could be explained by a Pareto distribution, which often happens in financial systems. According to him, this did not mean the platform was centralized. However, ZachXBT disagreed. He said one user had been making large swaps since the limit was raised to 10 cbBTC. He claimed this person added cbBTC through Coinbase and moved money linked to the Bybit hack. By April 2025, ZachXBT said most of the swaps on the platform were connected to this same group, which made the suspicious activity easier to spot. He questioned why the team at Garden Finance had not acted sooner. Garden Finance Allegedly Profits From Illegal Transactions ZachXBT accused Garden Finance of profiting from these illegal transactions. He said the team should return the fees earned from such swaps and shut down large transaction features. This has caused a big debate in the decentralized finance (DeFi). Similarly, Bybit asked ParaSwap DAO to return over $90,000 in ETH paid by a hacker in swap fees. He also claimed that part of the revenue was used in earlier airdrop farming, a strategy some use to unfairly benefit from new token releases.

2025-06-22T20:00:33,"‘Bond King’ Jeffrey Gundlach Warns Trend of US Outperformance Over ‘For Real,’ Says Investors in One Region Printing Money Right Now","DoubleLine Capital CEO Jeffrey Gundlach says that the trend of American exceptionalism has come to an abrupt end. In a new CNBC interview, the billionaire “Bond King” says that foreign investors have been happily investing in US assets over the last two decades, leading to massive capital inflows to the tune of tens of trillions of dollars. But now, Gundlach says he’s seeing signs that foreign investors are yanking capital out of US markets in favor of the euro and European equities. According to the hedge fund chief executive, the reversal in flows tells him that investors are now crowning a new market leader. “Foreigners have been very willing – downright enthusiastic, almost euphoric – about buying dollar assets over the past 18 years or so. Over $25 trillion has been invested in US financial markets, more than the US has invested in foreign markets. That’s a massive increase. It went from $3 trillion to $28 trillion by one measure. That may be reversing, and this is part of the underpinning for why I think that the trend of US outperformance is over. And I mean over for real… I’ve been recommending Europe in European currency for dollar-based investors. The [European] index has outperformed the US index by a decent amount, but if you had the currency side of it, if you own it in euros and you get the currency translation, you are just printing money right now.

2025-06-22T19:49:09,"Major Development Occurs for Bankrupt Cryptocurrency Exchange FTX","FTX Recovery Trust, which is managing the liquidation process of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, has filed a formal 94-page objection in the US Delaware bankruptcy court seeking to completely dismiss the over $1.5 billion claim by failed hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC). The appeal states that 3AC’s claim is “unrealistic, unsupportable, and based on an erroneous assumption regarding the account balance.” FTX argues that 3AC overstates the value of its digital assets. 3AC’s claim is based on FTX’s alleged holding of approximately $1.6 billion worth of digital assets on the platform when it went bankrupt in November 2022. However, as of June 2022, that account was worth only $284 million, including margin debt of more than $733 million, according to FTX’s statement. Related News: Bitcoin Price Below $100,000: Research Firm's Head of Research Reveals Next Support Level FTX alleged that 3AC ignored the debt burden and attempted to make its overly leveraged positions appear as “clean value.” According to the filing, most of that $284 million in assets disappeared in just two days. $222 million was wiped out by the crypto market crash, while $60 million was withdrawn by 3AC itself. FTX said they only liquidated one $82 million position after 3AC exceeded limits by not responding to margin calls. It claims this action was in accordance with the contract and “prevented a negative account balance.” The petition stated: “FTX creditors should not be insured against 3AC’s failed trades. The hedge fund took risky positions and messed it up. FTX took action as those positions collapsed.” If the court rules in FTX’s favor, 3AC’s claim could be dismissed entirely or significantly reduced to just ordinary creditor status, meaning the fund would only receive a small portion of the amount it is seeking. The next hearing will be held on August 12. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-22T19:22:00,"3 Best XRP Alternatives That Could 20-50x Your Portfolio In The Second Half Of 2025","The crypto market never sleeps; it evolves. While XRP remains a heavyweight in digital payments, forward-thinking investors are scanning the horizon for the next big opportunities. With cross-border transactions expected to balloon past $250 trillion within two years, fresh solutions are emerging that could leave even established players in the dust. Three projects – SUI, HYPE, and Remittix – are turning heads, each carving out distinct niches that might just deliver life-changing returns. What makes these alternatives special? They’re not just chasing XRP’s tail. Instead, they’re solving real problems in ways that could redefine entire sectors. As we approach mid-2025, these contenders offer exposure to growth vectors XRP simply can’t match, especially in the exploding PayFi space. SUI Network: Where Web3 meets Wall Street SUI isn’t just another blockchain, but Web3 built for scale. While XRP courts banks, SUI is rewriting the rulebook for decentralized applications. Recent moves have traders buzzing: a liquidity-boosting alliance between Momentum, Wormhole, and OKX has set the stage for what could be a major price surge. (ChatGPT’s bullish forecast didn’t hurt either.) Source: CoinGecko Here’s the kicker—SUI’s architecture solves the “blockchain trilemma” better than most. Fast transactions? Check. Ironclad security? You bet. And unlike XRP’s narrow focus, SUI plays well across DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise solutions. As institutions warm to Web3, this could be the infrastructure play that delivers triple-digit gains. Could HYPE ride Bitcoin’s coattails to the moon? Ever wish you’d bought Bitcoin in 2012? HYPE might be the next best thing. Whispers of massive BTC holdings by 2027 have speculators salivating. While XRP fights regulatory battles, HYPE is positioning itself as the institutional darling, labelled the “safe” crypto bet for Wall Street money. Source: CoinMarketCap The numbers tell the story: a projected $109 billion holding shift could send shockwaves through the market. Sure, it’s speculative. But remember, every crypto giant was once an underdog. HYPE’s secret sauce? It’s not trying to replace traditional finance like XRP. Instead, it’s becoming the bridge big money can’t ignore. Remittix: The silent killer of cross-border payments Let’s be honest, wire transfers are still stuck in the Stone Age. Remittix changes everything. Imagine sending crypto that lands as fiat in any bank account, with the recipient none the wiser. That’s not the future, either; it’s happening now across 40+ cryptocurrencies. While XRP battles SWIFT, Remittix sidesteps the fight entirely. Its Pay API lets businesses accept crypto while getting paid in dollars, with no volatility headaches. The real genius? Merchant accounts with 30+ fiat and 50+ crypto pairs. This isn’t just another payment rail—it’s the missing link between crypto’s speed and traditional finance’s reach. The presale is no slouch either, and tokens are flying off the shelves. Over $15.8 million has been raised to date, and with an entry price of $0.0781, early birds are locking on to this project en masse. Which XRP alternative works out best? XRP had its moment. SUI offers the tech stack for Web3’s next chapter. HYPE could be institutional money’s backdoor into crypto. But Remittix ? It’s solving the trillion-dollar pain point nobody else has cracked. The presale window won’t stay open forever. For investors who spotted Ethereum’s potential in 2016 or Solana’s in 2020, this feels eerily familiar. The question isn’t whether these alternatives will grow—it’s which one will leave XRP looking like yesterday’s news.

2025-06-22T19:05:47,"Bitcoin fell to $98K after Iran moved to shut the Strait of Hormuz","Bitcoin dropped under $99,000 on Sunday after Iran moved to close the Strait of Hormuz, cutting off one of the world’s main oil transport routes. The decision followed U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, escalating an already tense situation. The impact was immediate. Ethereum collapsed by 10%, trading at $2,180, while XRP slid by 8%, landing at $1.93. The total market reacted with sharp volume spikes, liquidations, and uncertainty that’s not going away anytime soon. The Strait of Hormuz, which sits between Iran and Oman, handles a quarter of global oil exports. Iran’s parliament, reacting to the U.S. military action, backed a proposal to block the channel. Source: Axios The parliament doesn’t control the Strait, that power belongs to the military and security forces, but the threat was still enough to shake global markets. ClearView Energy Partners warned that oil prices could open “meaningfully above” the $77.01 per barrel Friday close unless the U.S. and its allies make diplomatic moves. Crypto tanks across the board as Iran stirs oil chaos According to Reuters, the shutdown announcement came after the U.S. bombed several of Iran’s nuclear sites, triggering one of the strongest reactions yet in the long-running standoff between Iran and Israel . If this plays out, it’ll be the first time the conflict actually affects global oil flows. The crypto market took it hard. In the last 24 hours alone, Bitcoin saw $47.7 billion in volume as traders moved fast. The coin is now down 6.3% this week, with its market cap at $1.96 trillion. Ethereum, which was already struggling, is now down 14.3% over 7 days, with $29.5 billion in daily volume. XRP, hit by both the geopolitical shock and its usual regulatory baggage, is down 10.7% on the week with a $114 billion market cap. Solana, sitting at $128.65, fell 6.4%, dragging its weekly losses to nearly 15%. BNB didn’t escape either, shedding 3.9%, down to $608. Only Tether held firm to its dollar peg at $1.00, with over $76 billion in 24-hour trade. Even with no actual movement to seal off the channel yet, analysts aren’t brushing this off. Eurasia Group said Sunday that Iran likely won’t fully close Hormuz, but they expect “increased harassment of tanker traffic” in the coming days. That alone is enough to cause oil panic — and oil panic is now crypto panic. Arthur Hayes, economist and crypto veteran, reacted with one line: “Do you hear that? … it’s the sound of the money printers revving up to do their patriotic duty. This weakness shall pass and $BTC will leave no doubt as to its safe haven status.” U.S. officials call the move suicidal, warn of military response Despite the panic, the authority to block Hormuz isn’t up to Iran’s parliament. Security decisions go through the Revolutionary Guard, which hasn’t yet acted. Still, the threat alone has put pressure on Washington and raised the risk of a military showdown. Eurasia analyst Gregory Brew said that closing the Strait “would be an effective declaration of war against the Gulf states and the US.” He also noted that Iran, already weakened economically, is “unlikely to seek escalation of that kind at this time.” But there’s still tension. The U.S. has deployed major forces to the Gulf region, and any move from Iran could lead to an armed response. For crypto investors, that’s not a good sign. As long as oil routes are in danger, markets won’t stabilize. Crypto isn’t disconnected anymore. It’s tied directly to global energy routes. U.S. Vice President JD Vance also weighed in during an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press . “Their entire economy runs through the Strait of Hormuz. If they want to destroy their own economy and cause disruptions in the world, I think that would be their decision,” he said. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s fall is the worst it’s seen this quarter, and Bitcoin’s slip below $100K wipes out weeks of gains. XRP, already on shaky ground due to legal fights in the U.S., is now down 6% in a day, with a full 10.7% loss over 7 days. Market caps are crumbling, and the fear is showing in trade volume spikes. Right now, the only certainty is that nothing is certain. Crypto, oil, and geopolitics are locked in the same room, and Iran just turned off the lights.

2025-06-22T19:00:25,"$96k Or $144k? Bitcoin Mayer Multiple Chart Price Target Options","Bitcoin (BTC) has registered a slight uptick in the last few hours after US President Donald Trump announced a successful airstrike on Iranian nuclear facilities, a move aimed at de-escalating rising tensions in the Middle East after several days of conflict between Iran and Israel. Despite the short-term price reaction, BTC remains in a corrective phase, having struggled to break through the $110,000 resistance level over the past month with market sentiment being largely shaped by both global uncertainty and technical stagnation. Amid this backdrop, a crypto analyst with X pseudonym On-Chain College has highlighted two prospective price targets based on on-chain data. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Breakdown Spurs Sell-Offs, Analyst Reveals What Will Happen If BTC Hits 92,800 Market Odds Favor Further Upside For Bitcoin – Analyst In a recent X post on June 21, On-Chain College shares a positive long-term Bitcoin price outlook using the Mayer Multiple, an on-chain metric that measures relationship between Bitcoin’s price and its 200-day moving average (200DMA). By tracking key valuation bands, the Mayer Multiple helps determine whether Bitcoin is overvalued, undervalued, or fairly valued, based on historical price behavior. Since the bull market commenced in Q4 2024, Bitcoin has consistently moved between 1.0x band i.e. the 200DMA (blue line) and the 1.5x band (orange line) representing the mid price range zone. Notably, the Bitcoin price struggles in the past have generated speculations of potential market top at the current market high. However, the Mayer Multiple chart shows that BTC has only ever attained a cycle price peak after hitting the 2.5x band (red line). Therefore, there is still room for price growth in the current bull market. However, the immediate price targets for premier cryptocurrency lies at $96,000 (1.0x) or $144,000 (1.5x). Notably, there is significant potential to rediscover its bullish form and surge towards $144,000 in line with its defined-range bound movement. However, there are also equal chances of a return to $96,000 which On-Chain College states would aid in flushing out weak hands before a full-scale bullish price reversal. Related Reading: XRP Daily New Addresses Plunge 80% In 2025 — Bearish On-Chain Metrics Raise Alarm Bitcoin Price Outlook At the time of writing, Bitcoin is valued at $102,700 following a 1.50% decline in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the maiden cryptocurrency also reports losses of 2.94% and 8.08% on the weekly and monthly chart, respectively. According to CoinCodex, the general market sentiment remains neutral. However, CoinCodex analysts foresee an impending price breakout with an audacious projection of $136,472 within the next five days. Interestingly, it’s worth noting that this level may represent or come close to the cycle market top, as long-term forecasts include $138,379 in three months and $116,115 in six months.

2025-06-22T18:47:57,"Texas Establishes State-Run Bitcoin Reserve with Passage of SB21","Texas Governor Greg Abbott has officially signed Senate Bill 21 (SB21), creating the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a state-operated fund that will hold Bitcoin as a long-term financial asset. The move makes Texas the first U.S. state to not only legalize a Bitcoin reserve but also to directly allocate public funds toward building digital asset holdings. Unlike traditional state investments, the reserve will function outside Texas’ general treasury, serving as a hedge against inflation and a new tool to bolster the state’s financial resilience. Strict Criteria Ensures Bitcoin-Only Holdings According to the bill, only assets with a market capitalization exceeding $500 billion are eligible for inclusion in the fund. Currently, Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency meeting that requirement. The Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts will manage the fund with guidance from a three-member advisory board composed of cryptocurrency investment experts. Reserve Can Grow Through Airdrops and Donations The legislation allows for the Bitcoin reserve to expand through various mechanisms beyond direct purchases. These include blockchain forks, investment gains, and even airdrops or public donations. A transparency provision mandates that a comprehensive report on the fund’s holdings and performance be published every two years. Legal Protections Cement Reserve Independence The passage of SB21 follows the earlier signing of House Bill 4488, which protects the reserve from being transferred into the general revenue fund. This measure ensures the fund remains insulated from broader budgetary shifts and fiscal pressures. Texas now joins Arizona and New Hampshire as the third U.S. state to approve a Bitcoin reserve policy. However, Texas is unique in that it is the first to use state funds and establish an independent structure for its holdings. Corporate Adoption of Bitcoin Continues to Grow Public interest in Bitcoin reserves is being mirrored in the corporate world. Nakamoto Holdings, a Bitcoin investment firm founded by David Bailey, a crypto adviser to former President Donald Trump, recently raised $51.5 million through a PIPE (private investment in public equity) transaction to increase its Bitcoin portfolio. Meanwhile, France’s Blockchain Group has added 182 BTC worth approximately $19.6 million to its reserves, bringing its total to 1,653 BTC. Growing Institutional Demand Signals Enduring Bitcoin Interest Recent data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET shows that more organizations have begun holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset over the past month. This aligns with a broader trend pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which has been at the forefront of public company Bitcoin adoption.

The city of Spokane is banning crypto kiosks after the City Council voted unanimously to pass an ordinance that seeks to protect its residents against scams aided by digital asset ATMs. “This ordinance prohibits virtual currency kiosks from being operated in the City of Spokane. Spokane has seen a significant increase in scams arising from the use of cryptocurrency kiosks, and there has been a steady increase in victims losing thousands of dollars. This ordinance provides for a tool to protect consumers from those individuals who rely primarily on virtual currency to defraud others.” Crypto kiosks allow users to buy and transfer digital assets using cash, debit or credit cards. While the machines do not dispense any cash, they allow users to deposit crypto assets in their personal wallets or transfer the funds overseas. “Virtual currency kiosk transactions move quickly, and can occur anywhere and, because of the speed of the transaction, the majority of such transactions are irrevocable… In some cases, law enforcement are able to trace cryptocurrency transactions and ‘follow the money,’ however, many of the ‘scams’ or nefarious transactions transfer funds to destinations overseas, and U.S. law enforcement may encounter significant challenges in other jurisdictions.” Council member Paul Dillon says crypto kiosks have become the “preferred tool” of scammers looking to exploit unsuspecting individuals. “This ordinance will protect vulnerable Spokane residents from scams involving virtual currency kiosks, and I am proud we are the first city in the state to move this legislation forward.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-22T18:11:21,"Controversial crypto donation changes Czech political attitudes","The political upheaval surrounding a Czech minister’s unwise decision to accept a $45 million Bitcoin donation from a drug dealer is set to cement the opposition’s lead in the run-up to the parliamentary elections in October. While the government survived a no-confidence vote, the affair is hurting support for the ruling coalition, the latest polling data indicated. The main opposition party, which initiated the motion, is heading towards victory, backed by almost a third of the Czechs. Controversial crypto donation changes Czech political attitudes ANO, the right-wing populist party of businessman and former Prime Minister Andrej Babiš, is on its way to winning the upcoming election for members of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house parliament in the Czech Republic. According to a new survey conducted by the STEM research institute for CNN Prima News, ANO (“Yes”) is going to be the leading political party this fall, with more than 31% of the vote, the Czech TV channel reported . Its role as the main opposition force remains unchallenged thanks to a wide voter base, the authors noted. Babiš’s party enjoys significant support among less educated and older people, but it doesn’t lag behind in any other group, the authors noted, adding: “The movement is unthreatened in its position as the leader of opposition voices.” The Spolu (“Together”) center-right coalition, led by the current head of government, Petr Fiala, and his Civic Democratic Party (ODS), comes in second with a little over 20%. At the start of the month, support for Spolu was actually growing. However, the Bitcoin scandal is clearly affecting its results. Highlighting that serious factors like this usually take several weeks to fully manifest, STEM commented: “The question is whether the decline will continue or Spolu will manage to stabilize support.” The far-right Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD), another opposition faction, has in the meantime consolidated support and strengthened its position as the main representative of the protest vote. Like ANO, the party fares well among older middle-aged Czechs and those without high school diploma. The centrist and liberal “Mayors and Independents” (STAN) party, an ally of the political alliance of ODS, the Christian Democrats (KDU-ČSL) and the liberal-conservative TOP 09 in the ruling majority, has registered a decline like the rest of the coalition. Its support stands at 9.4% compared to nearly 13% earlier this year. ANO on way to victory despite failed attempt to bring down government STEM’s poll has been carried out between May 30 and June 17, among 2,074 respondents from across the Czech Republic. If the elections were held in that period, ANO would have secured 78 seats in the 200-member Chamber of Deputies while the Spolu coalition would have received 48. The party was the main driver behind the push to topple the current government. Earlier this week, the Fiala cabinet survived a no-confidence vote in parliament, with all parties in it largely supporting the executive power. The whole saga revolved around revelations that the Ministry of Justice had accepted 1 billion koruna ($45 million) in Bitcoin from Tomáš Jiřikovský, the operator of a darknet market convicted of drug trafficking, embezzlement, and illegal possession of arms. Justice Minister Pavel Blažek stepped down from his post to take political responsibility. But the Czech opposition also demanded that the prime minister do the same. ANO said it will continue to push for the resignation of Finance Minister Zbyněk Stanjura as well, accusing him of failing to notify relevant authorities about the suspicious crypto donation. Other parties included in the STEM survey that may or may not enter the next Chamber of Deputies include the liberal progressive Czech Pirate Party (Pirates) with 7.2%, the leftist Stačilo! (Enough!) with 5.4%, and the anti-green Motoristé sobě (Motorists for Themselves) party with 4.4%.

Following today’s events that led to escalating Iran-US tensions, the Bitcoin price has fallen below the $100,000 mark, which it has been hovering above for a long time. According to Moreno, demand is still increasing in spot markets, but the growth rate has fallen below the historical trend. Related News: Here's the List of 15 Altcoins Experiencing a Surge in Trading Volume in South Korea Moreno stated that Bitcoin purchases made by whales and ETFs have decreased by half, and that demand from new investors is also decreasing. In the futures market, investors have recently started to open new short positions by taking profits. If this weakening in demand continues, according to Moreno, Bitcoin could be a support point at the $92,000 level, which corresponds to the average cost of investors on the chain. This level is considered a typical support area, usually seen in bull markets. However, if this support is broken, the next important support level is around $81,000, which represents the lower band of the average cost of investors. *This is not investment advice.

In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin recorded $209.1 million in liquidations across major exchanges, according to data from Coinalyze retrieved by Finbold on June 22. Bitcoin liquidation chart. Source: Coinlyze The majority, $206.8 million, came from perpetual contracts, with an additional $2.4 million from futures contracts. Long positions were hardest hit, accounting for $184 million, compared to $25 million in short liquidations. The data reflects activity across platforms such as Bybit, Binance , OKX, Bitfinex, Huobi, and BitMEX. Bitcoin price analysis The extended liquidation coincided with Bitcoin falling below the psychological $100,000 mark. Bitcoin was trading at $99,046 at press time, down 4% in the last 24 hours and over 5% in the past week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Technically, the asset is showing short-term weakness but maintains a longer-term bullish structure. To this end, BTC is trading below the 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $104,908 but remains well above the 200-day SMA of $87,554. The 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) stands at 42.15, signaling neutral to slightly oversold conditions. While not yet in oversold territory, it suggests limited buying pressure and room for a rebound if support holds. As reported by Finbold, analysts warn that slipping below $100,000 could pave the way for further downside. The report suggested that Bitcoin could retreat to around $80,000 in the coming months if the selling pressure persists. On the other hand, cryptocurrency trading expert Michaël van de Poppe’s analysis in an X post on May 22 indicated that Bitcoin has recorded a sharp rise in volatility. He views this as a potential capitulation phase, with the market nearing a major support zone. Volatility going through the roof on #Bitcoin .

2025-06-22T17:10:48,"Bitcoin Leads Crypto Sell-Off After U.S. Bombs Iranian Nuclear Facilities","Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a sharp drop Saturday night, leading other cryptos lower, as news broke that the United States had bombed three major nuclear facilities in Iran. The geopolitical shockwave triggered a swift market reaction, sending Bitcoin tumbling to as low as $99,811. The strikes, which targeted Iran’s Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan nuclear sites, were confirmed by President Donald Trump in a post on Truth Social. Calling the attack a “resounding success,” Trump warned that “far greater” force could be used if Iran retaliates. The statement marked a significant escalation following weeks of rising tensions between Iran and Israel, and has pushed global markets, including crypto, into a state of heightened uncertainty. The impact on the broader cryptocurrency market was immediate and severe. Over $40 billion was wiped from total market capitalization within a few hours, dragging the global crypto market cap down to $3.14 trillion, a 2.36% decline on the day as per CoinMarketCap data. Ethereum was hit even harder than Bitcoin, falling 6.83% to $2,196.66. Solana slumped 6.18% to $129, while XRP dipped 5.73% to $1.96. On-chain data from Santiment showed a rapid spike in mentions of “Iran” and “Trump” across crypto-related social media channels. On Sunday, analysts from the firm suggested that the timing of the strikes, late Saturday U.S. time, may have blunted the initial reaction, as much of the retail market was offline. Meanwhile, despite the immediate sell-off, some traders are referencing historical patterns in which Bitcoin recovered quickly from wartime shocks. In 2022, Bitcoin rallied over 40% within a month of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. More recently, price rebounds followed Iran-Israel missile exchanges in 2024. Still, others are preparing for more downside. Technical analysts have identified $97,000 as a potential key support level, with some predicting a possible dip to as low as $93,000 if tensions worsen. “A dump towards $93K–$94K before bottom formation and reversal,” adding there’s a “20%–25% chance of this happening.” Analyst Cas Abbe warned . He drew parallels to April 2025, when Bitcoin dropped days after U.S. tariff announcements. “Most people thought it was the bottom but BTC actually bottomed 4 days after it.” On current events, he added, “Most are expecting this to be a bottom. But what if April 2025 repeats again? BTC could dump 7%–8% more.” That said, with roughly 40,000 U.S. troops stationed across the Middle East and no clear de-escalation signals from either Washington or Tehran, the situation remains highly fluid. Investors are bracing for further market tremors as the crisis unfolds and global leaders weigh in.

2025-06-22T17:00:13,"$312M ETH Transfer Triggers Sell-Off Fears As Ethereum Price Crashes Below Support","Blockchain tracking service Whale Alert posted a major alert showing that 129,392 ETH was transferred from an unidentified wallet to Coinbase as the Ethereum price tumbled. On-chain data from Etherscan shows that this particular wallet had not been involved in the transfer of large ETH volumes since November 2022. This sudden reactivation and deposit into a centralized exchange opens up speculation of a looming selloff, especially given the timing of the transfer. Massive ETH Transfer As Middle East Tensions Escalate Whale transaction tracker Whale Alerts, which initially reported the transfer on the social media platform X, noted that at the time of the transfer, these 129,392 ETH were worth $312,981,377. The timing of the transfer is noteworthy because it occurred when the price of Ethereum failed to hold above $2,500 and had already begun to struggle to stay above $2,400. Related Reading: XRP On-Chain Activity Down 80% In 5 Months, Experts Argue Bullish/Bearish Implications Etherscan’s tracking of on-chain transactions indicates that the unknown wallet “0xd47b,” which was involved in the transfer, has been relatively inactive since late 2022. Particularly, its last transaction was an inflow of 6,469 ETH from another wallet linked to Coinbase. The latest transfer into Coinbase leans more towards the possibility of a selloff through the exchange. Since then, the Ethereum price has lost a key support level at $2,450. Its price has fallen notably in the past 48 hours. Although other factors are clearly contributing to the dip, particularly new geopolitical tensions after the US launched attacks on Iran, this whale deposit into Coinbase may have increased the downward pressure. Exchange inflows of this magnitude are a precursor to liquidation, particularly now that investor sentiment is on edge. Bearish Setup Confirms Downside Targets The technical picture for Ethereum is now turning bearish, at least in the short term. Technical analysis of Ethereum’s 4-hour chart on the TradingView platform shows a clear bearish breakdown setup after Ethereum broke below a crucial support line at $2,362. That support level has now been breached, and confirmation of the breakdown amplifies a bearish case moving forward. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Breakdown Spurs Sell-Offs, Analyst Reveals What Will Happen If BTC Hits 92,800 Chart Image From TradingView The chart above, which includes overlays of the Ichimoku Cloud, shows a fading bullish momentum in the past few days. Previous failed attempts to break resistance have left Ethereum in a vulnerable zone, and the recent whale selloff may have delivered the final push needed to trigger this leg down. If the current trajectory continues, Ethereum could be on its way to retesting lows below $2,000. According to the TradingView analysis, potential reversal targets are at $2,151 and $1,954, with a third possible level at $1,750 if the selloff is more than expected. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,290, down by 5.5% and 10% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively.

2025-06-22T16:57:17,"Can the Crypto Market End the Month on a High Note? A Price Prediction for the Coming Week For Major Cryptos","As the month nears its end, the crypto market holds investors' attention. There is curiosity about whether leading cryptocurrencies will experience a surge in their prices. This article delves into the upcoming week's price predictions, focusing on major cryptos that could potentially witness significant growth. Get insights into which digital coins are primed for a bullish run. Bitcoin: Short-Term Correction Amid Long-Term Resilience Bitcoin experienced an 8.23% decline over the past month and a 2.93% drop in the last week, while showing a 7.99% gain over six months. Price movements have been volatile, indicating a short-term pullback against the backdrop of mid-term strength. Oscillations have kept Bitcoin within a dynamic trading envelope, revealing both recent selling pressure and prior upward momentum. Bitcoin currently trades between $94,832 and $113,326, with immediate resistance at $121,869 and solid support at $84,880. A secondary resistance at $140,364 and support at $66,385 further define the trading zone. The market appears to be under bearish pressure short term, marked by recent monthly declines, but the six-month gain suggests underlying strength. Traders may consider buying near support levels if prices remain above $84,880 while monitoring for movement towards $121,869 that could indicate a bullish reversal. Ethereum Market Analysis: Past Trends and Present Price Signals Ethereum experienced a decline of roughly 15% over the last month, while the price fell by nearly 34% in the past six months. This trend has shown a gradual erosion of value characterized by repeated pullbacks and a narrower trading range. Price levels have consistently shifted downward, indicating rising caution among traders and an overall bearish sentiment. Recent sessions displayed a mix of downward movements followed by brief recoveries, which were insufficient to reverse the longer-term decline. Previous technical patterns confirm that sellers have dominated the market, prompting traders to reassess short-term outlooks. Presently, Ethereum trades within a defined range between approximately $1,924 and $2,962. The nearest resistance is near $3,395, while primary support is observed around $1,319. Technical indicators such as a sub-40 RSI and negative momentum readings suggest that bears control the market in the short term. There is no clear upward trend, and alternating price bounces complicate predictions for a significant rally. Trading strategies may involve careful short positions near resistance with tight stops, while buying near support could prompt short covering. Traders are advised to remain alert to sudden market shifts and to manage risk effectively. Solana Price Analysis: Declines and Key Support in Focus Solana has shown a steady decline over the past month and six months. The coin recorded a 25.16% drop within one month and a 29.20% fall over the last six months. A weekly downturn of 7.18% also reflects the ongoing bearish performance. Price movements have followed a negative trend with lower highs and a lack of strong buying interest, which has kept the momentum subdued. This pattern indicates that long-term pressure is holding the asset back from a significant recovery. Currently, Solana trades in a range between $136 and $182. The price is facing near-term resistance at $207.9, while support is identified at $115.84. Technical indicators highlight bearish pressure, with an Awesome Oscillator at -16.569 and a Momentum Indicator at -18.03. The relative strength index at 33.23 suggests the coin is oversold and could see short-term buying. However, bears dominate the scene, and traders might consider buying near strong support if a reversal occurs, watching resistance at $253.93 for a potential breakout. Conclusion Bitcoin and Ethereum are likely to maintain their current momentum if trading volumes stay high. Solana has shown robust growth patterns and could continue to rise if these trends persist. The coming week presents an opportunity for gains across major cryptos, contingent on favorable market conditions. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In a new press release , the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) says that Oliver Tejada, 25, of the Bronx, New York, has been handed a 60-month prison sentence for masterminding a scheme that stole cash from 11 different bank branches, 10 of which were located in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Authorities say that Tejada and his co-conspirators stole more than $1 million from 23 victims, though in some instances the banks caught on and reversed their transactions, resulting in the banks losing a total of $780,837. To pull off their scheme, Tejada and his co-conspirators would target the elderly and other victims to obtain their private bank account information, make calls to banks to gather additional information about their targets, then use an impostor with fraudulent documents, such as a fake ID, to come in to various branches and make large withdrawals or wire transfers. The transfers would be sent to an account of someone who was recruited to receive the money and quickly deplete the account. In some instances, the imposter would use the fake identification documents to obtain a debit card. Tejada was originally charged in May 2024, and he pleaded guilty earlier this year to conspiracy to commit bank fraud, bank fraud and aggravated identity theft.

2025-06-22T16:55:09,"ZachXBT Accuses Garden Finance Bridging Service of Assisting North Korean Hackers to Launder Bybit Funds","Garden Finance, a Bitcoin bridging service, has been accused of assisting hackers to launder money. ZachXBT, a crypto analyst, said that over 80% of Garden Finance’s fees were sourced from laundered money. Garden Finance had around $300,000 in fees. ZachXBT is convinced that Garden Finance is somehow involved in shady transactions and that he can prove it by conducting blockchain analysis. ZachXBT believes there is a link between the Bybit hack of $1.4 billion and the Garden Finance platform. The contention exists over whether 30 BTC was used to enable money laundering. Garden Finance has replied that the 30 BTC was used before the Bybit hack occurred. The debate between Garden Finance and ZachXBT is ongoing. The Bybit hack occurred on February 21, 2025, involving an exploit of a cold wallet, resulting in the loss of $1.4 billion in Ethereum. The attacker compromised a SAFE wallet used by a Bybit developer and exploited the wallet five days after the initial compromise. ZachXBT, amongst other blockchain analysts, traced the stolen funds to DeFi addresses used by North Korea’s Lazarus Group. However, when confronted with the latest accusations, Garden Finance co-founder Jaz Gulati said ZachXBT was basing his analysis on misinformation. ZachXBT asked why money launderers were topping up Garden Finance’s liquidity from Coinbase while moving compromised Bybit funds. The debate continued, with other developers stepping in to give their opinions about the recent controversy. Jaz Gulati, co-founder of Garden Finance, defended his platform against the allegations. He pointed out that the 30 BTC of fees were collected before the Bybit attack, refuting the claim that they had somehow been involved. ZachXBT continued his analysis by claiming other links between Bybit and the WazirX hack, which was linked to the Lazarus Group. ZachXBT surmised that the problem was exacerbated by the fact that Garden Finance was not analysing its blockchain data to prevent a single actor from controlling the network. ZachXBT essentially said the network was compromised due to a lack of decentralized structures within the ecosystem. The arguments against the Garden Bridge may be valid drawbacks to the Bitcoin bridge system, which nefarious groups could hijack to launder money. However, these vulnerabilities may be inherent to the bridging infrastructure rather than the intent of Garden Finance developers. James Scaur, a supporter of Garden Finance, jumped into the debate to support Gulati and to possibly provide a valid reason for the blockchain links. Scaur suggested that the Pareto distribution could provide a valid reason for the unequal distribution of liquidity providers, indicating that only a small number of liquidity nodes give the majority of liquidity for a service. Scaur suggested an alternative reason for the blockchain links that ZachXBT uncovered, pointing out that at any given time, there may be only a few liquidity providers present. Scaur further argued that it is a difficult task to block hackers from using swap services and does not necessarily imply complicity on the part of Garden Finance. However, ZachXBT was not convinced by Scaur’s argument, responding that Garden Finance lacked decentralisation because a single node provided the majority of liquidity for weeks after Garden Finance changed the threshold for large swaps to 10 cbBTC. ZachXBT also pointed out that Garden Finance had minimal activity apart from Bybit transactions, making the platform easy to analyse and spot illicit transactions. Decentralisation loopholes and compliance issues have plagued the blockchain industry lately, with various problems that could disrupt the integrity of blockchains across the globe. Garden Finance prides itself on being a decentralized, trustless bridge service. However, ZachXBT has accused the service of having a single point of failure, which North Korean hackers are exploiting. Jaz Gulati, co-founder of Garden Finance, has not been impressed by ZachXBT’s accusations and has tried to defend his service from being linked with the Bybit hack. However, if a single liquidity provider can dominate the bridging service, the service may function as a private exchange for nefarious activities. Lazarus Group uses various DeFi and mixer services to launder their hacked proceeds. Whether Garden Finance was complicit in helping North Korean hackers or whether they were duped into supporting illicit activities is yet to be established. Traders, however, may be interested in the validity of these bridging services to ascertain whether their funds are truly being swapped with a trustless infrastructure.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/zachxbt-accuses-garden-finance-bridging-service-of-assisting-north-korean-hackers-to-launder-bybit-funds/,"ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Bybit|Ethereum News",cryptocompare

The attack reportedly took out three major nuclear-powered sites, sparking geopolitical tension and a wave of panic across global markets. As news of the airstrikes broke, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other leading cryptocurrencies saw heavy sell-offs, with billions wiped from the market in just hours. Many bullish positions were liquidated as traders rushed to pull out of risky assets amid fears of further escalation. The price of Pi Network’s Pi Coin has plunged by 11% in the last 24 hours, slipping dangerously close to its all-time low. At the time of writing, Pi is trading at $0.47, leaving many holders worried about the coin’s future. This latest drop comes after a difficult few weeks for Pi Coin, with prices crashing over 30% in June alone. One of the main reasons behind the fall is a massive token unlock of 263 million Pi tokens this month, worth around $143 million. This huge increase in supply has added selling pressure, pushing prices down. Technical indicators show that Pi might be approaching oversold territory, a level where prices often bounce back. On top of that, June 28th, known as 2 Pi Day in the Pi community — is just days away. Historically, the project has made big announcements around this date, and many are hoping for fresh updates, partnerships, or new features that could lift market sentiment.

2025-06-22T16:28:39,"Why Michael Saylor Is Confident Bitcoin Will Rise To $21 Million By 2046","Bitcoin’s most vocal evangelist, Michael Saylor, is more bullish than ever amid fast-changing regulatory and crypto adoption trends. On Saturday, Saylor upped his ante on his Bitcoin price projections. His new target? An eye-popping $21 million per BTC in 21 years . Saylor’s Ultra-Bullish Bitcoin Price Forecast Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor caused a shockwave in the cryptoverse when he took the stage with a keynote speech at BTC Prague 2025 on June 21. The price of the biggest digital coin may have taken a hit in recent weeks, but Saylor proclaimed that it was still headed to $21 million per coin by 2046, describing this as a “very special time in the network.” “I think we’re going to be $21 million in 21 years. It’s a very special time in the network. Maybe the one time in the history of the network where you look out 21 years and you see $21 million,” Saylor said. This target represents a spectacular leap compared to his previous prediction made at the Bitcoin conference in Nashville in 2024, when he called for a $13 million price tag by 2045 . The 21 million figure is quite significant in the Bitcoin space, where the maximum 21 million units give the top crypto real scarcity. Super Bullish Developments That “Nobody Guessed” During his speech, Saylor pinned his increasing bullishness on Bitcoin to major regulatory and adoption developments, which he believes nobody expected last year. “Stuff that’s happened in the past 11 months has been extraordinary. The White House has embraced Bitcoin. This is an extraordinary development. We didn’t anticipate this,” Saylor postulated. The uber bull stressed that he has always remained optimistic on the premier crypto, even when its price fell to $16,000 lows during the last bear market, but Donald Trump’s return to the White House has “brought a sea change in politics,” he observed. According to Saylor, even the most ardent Bitcoin advocates had not envisioned such a radical political transformation, with President Trump havin fully embraced Bitcoin. “Although we thought we might have a pro-Bitcoin president, we didn’t think we’d get a strategic Bitcoin reserve. We didn’t think that the president would say America would be the Bitcoin superpower of the world. This is an amazing development,” the BTC preacher asserted. He also pointed out that there are three bills currently being progressed in the United States, including the GENIUS Act on stablecoins and the Bitcoin Act. These legislative initiatives around crypto signal unprecedented institutional acceptance of the nascent asset class. Saylor’s Bitcoin development company, Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy), now holds 592,100 Bitcoin , worth around $58 billion at the current price of $99,581. While reaching $21 million is a mighty target, the convergence of bullish fundamental catalysts highlighted by Saylor makes it a realistic price target.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/why-michael-saylor-is-confident-bitcoin-will-rise-to-21-million-by-2046/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Michael Saylor",cryptocompare
2025-06-22T16:26:11,"Texas Governor Signs Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill Into Law","Texas Governor Greg Abbott has given the final sign-off to a landmark legislation to establish a Bitcoin reserve, moving the state closer to officially adopting crypto as part of its treasury management. Senate Bill 21, a bipartisan-backed bill, was signed into law on Saturday, making Texas the third state in the US to adopt Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Texas Governor Approves Bitcoin Reserve Law Texas has joined Arizona and New Hampshire in creating a state-run Bitcoin reserve fund. SB21, also known as “The Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act,” seeks to enable the creation of a Bitcoin reserve outside the usual state treasury that the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts will manage. The reserve is intended to allow the state to invest in Bitcoin and other qualifying crypto assets to potentially hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty, as well as strengthen overall financial resilience. However, the law requires that the assets must maintain an average market capitalization of around $500 billion over the previous 24 months. Bitcoin is the only crypto asset that meets this criterion. According to CoinMarketCap data , Bitcoin currently sits at over $2 trillion in market valuation. SB21 follows Governor Abbott’s signing of House Bill 4488 , which protects the reserve from being absorbed into the state’s general revenue fund, effectively insulating it from shifting budget priorities. US Government’s National Plans As the third to authorize its treasurer to set up a Bitcoin reserve, Texas could very well beat the U.S. government in forming a stockpile, too. Governor Abbott’s approval comes as US President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers propose similar policies at the federal level. Trump issued an executive order in March, authorizing the establishment of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve for the United States, along with a separate digital assets stockpile for other cryptocurrencies. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, who reintroduced the Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act, proposed that the US government could acquire roughly 1 million BTC over five years. As ZyCrypto has previously reported , the Trump administration has stressed the need to leverage “budget-neutral ways” to acquire Bitcoin without burdening taxpayers.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/texas-governor-signs-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-bill-into-law/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|texas",cryptocompare
