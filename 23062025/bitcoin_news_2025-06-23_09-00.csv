2025-06-23T06:21:24,"Robert Kiyosaki Predicts Biggest Market Crash in History Is Coming","The post Robert Kiyosaki Predicts Biggest Market Crash in History Is Coming appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market slipped over the weekend as rising Middle East tensions and inflation fears triggered a selloff. Bitcoin dropped below $99,000 for the first time since May, with Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin also falling sharply. Though prices slightly recovered by late Sunday, major coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum remained down, reflecting investor caution amid growing global uncertainty. The rising geopolitical tensions after Trump’s strike on Iran and the continuous debt pressure weigh on markets. Amid this unease, renowned author and investor Robert Kiyosaki has renewed his warning about what he calls the “biggest global debt bubble burst in history.” As digital assets and traditional markets fluctuate, Kiyosaki’s predictions are again sparking conversations across the financial world. GLOBAL MONETARY COLLAPSE COMING? Will you be richer or poorer when biggest debt bubble in history bursts. I recommend owning gold, silver, and BITCOIN if you want to be richer when the Global Debt Bubble bursts. BIGGEST LOSERS will be savers of fake fiat money and especially… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 23, 2025 Kiyosaki’s Call for Tangible Assets In a recent X post, Kiyosaki urged investors to move away from fiat currency savings and instead build positions in tangible assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin. His long-held belief is that these alternatives offer better protection against looming economic instability. He reiterated that the global economy is dangerously inflated with debt and that a collapse is not only possible but likely. Past Predictions Back in Focus I shouldn’t brag but in 2013 I published “Rich Dads Prophecy” predicting the world economy today. It still pisses-me -off that so many modern day “prophets” whose names I will not mention, due to “professional courtesy” are now claiming to have warned of this extreme crisis we… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) June 19, 2025 Kiyosaki’s views aren’t new. He previously discussed similar warnings in his book Rich Dad’s Prophecy, which he claims accurately forecasted today’s economic scenario. Lately, he’s expressed frustration over what he sees as newer voices gaining recognition for insights he believes he shared years ago. His prediction of a potential silver surge, possibly doubling in value by year-end, has also resurfaced in recent discussions, further strengthening his focus on commodities. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Exclusive Bitcoin Price Prediction: Jetking CFO Expects BTC to Hit $150K by Year-End , Looking at the current scenario, he bets high on silver and believes it is the best investment right now, as of June 2025. He believes gold and Bitcoin are currently too expensive and is waiting for a price drop before buying more. Impact on Investor Sentiment Kiyosaki’s warning hits hard for many investors who are already nervous about the shaky state of the global economy. While some think he’s being overly dramatic, others agree with his advice to move money into things like gold, silver, and Bitcoin instead of relying too much on regular cash savings. With growing doubts about the strength of traditional currencies, his message is gaining attention. As markets face more uncertainty, voices like Kiyosaki’s, whether you agree with them or not, are pushing more people to think about where their money is safest during tough times. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Markets lost 4% in a fall to $3.15 trillion but managed to recover slightly during early trading in Asia on Monday morning. Losses were led by Bitcoin, which fell to $98,500 briefly in its first sub-six-figure dip since May 8. However, BTC had reclaimed the $101,000 level at the time of writing. Ethereum dumped more than 7% in a fall to $2,135, its lowest level since it broke above $2,000 in early May. Nevertheless, it also made a minor recovery to trade around $2,240 on Monday morning.

According to Wedson, Binance’s spot trading volume has once again reached a dominant position in the market, which historically means a bullish signal for Bitcoin. Joao Wedson said the following in a statement on his social media account: “Binance’s Spot volume is now equal to all other exchanges combined. Also, Binance’s Spot volume is 10 times larger than Coinbase. The gap between Binance and other exchanges in spot volume is about to turn positive, which has triggered bull periods for Bitcoin in the past. Therefore, it is important to follow this trend closely.” Wedson also called on investors to make data-based evaluations, saying, “Off-chain data does not lie. Be careful.” Related News: Caution: A New Type of Cryptocurrency Scam Has Emerged - Here Are the Precautions to Take The Alphractal team, on the other hand, announced in their analysis of on-chain data that old whales, the classic big investors of Bitcoin, have not yet taken action. Stating that BTC transaction volumes over $ 100,000 remain at 2020 levels, the analysis stated that such big movements are usually seen in bull markets, but there has been no significant increase since 2022. Joao Wedson also drew attention to the “Bitcoin Long Term Power Law” model that he uses for Bitcoin’s long-term price prediction. This special log-log scale chart reveals Bitcoin’s potential with trend lines drawn with linear regression. According to Wedson, according to this model, it seems unlikely that the BTC price will remain below $108,000 until 2033, as it would contradict Bitcoin's historical growth curve. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-23T05:58:20,"Michael Saylor Predicts Bitcoin Will Hit $21M by 2046","Saylor pointed to the U.S. government's shifting stance and legislative momentum as key catalysts. Meanwhile, Blockstream CEO Adam Back defended the premium on Strategy stock by pointing to the firm's rapid BTC accumulation. BTC Prague also shed some light on Europe’s potential in Bitcoin adoption, as Jan3’s Samson Mow met with French lawmaker Sarah Knafo to discuss a national Bitcoin reserve. France’s recent crypto investments could mean that there is growing interest, though EU-wide adoption still faces regulatory hurdles. Saylor Sees Bitcoin at $21 Million Bitcoin bull and Strategy founder Michael Saylor delivered a strikingly optimistic forecast for Bitcoin during his keynote speech at the BTC Prague 2025 event. He predicted that the leading cryptocurrency could reach a price of $21 million within 21 years. Saylor’s bold projection is a big increase from his previous forecast at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, where he envisioned Bitcoin reaching $13 million by 2045. This dramatic revision reflects what Saylor described as an extraordinary shift in the geopolitical and regulatory landscape surrounding Bitcoin over the past year. Saylor credited his bullishness to unprecedented developments that he claimed were unimaginable just 11 months ago. Chief among these was the White House’s apparent embrace of Bitcoin, which he said was a landmark moment in US political history. He pointed to Donald Trump’s election victory in November of 2024 as a pivotal moment that ushered in a new era of pro-Bitcoin politics. According to Saylor, the notion that the United States could establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve or proclaim itself a global Bitcoin superpower was once inconceivable but is now becoming reality. Michael Saylor speaking at the BTC Prague event In addition to political changes, Saylor pointed out major legislative advancements, including progress on three crypto-focused bills in the United States — the Genius Act, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, and the Bitcoin Act. He also mentioned that individual US states are increasingly embracing Bitcoin, which helps solidify the asset’s place in the mainstream financial system. While Saylor is an advocate for Bitcoin, his views on custody have attracted some criticism. Although Strategy holds a massive Bitcoin treasury — now totaling 592,100 BTC — the company refused to disclose the exact storage details of these holdings. Saylor pointed to security concerns as the reason for withholding proof-of-reserves information. His previous opposition to self-custody also sparked backlash. However, he reversed this stance in October 2024 by stating his support for self-custody by those “willing and able.” The BTC Prague event itself saw strong support for self-custody and open-source Bitcoin tools. Danny Sanders, chief commercial officer at Trezor, reported that more than 5,000 attendees participated in the event. Adam Back Defends Strategy’s Stock Premium Blockstream CEO Adam Back defended the premium on Strategy stock by saying it is justified given how quickly the company doubles its Bitcoin per share. Back also spoke at BTC Prague in an interview with Bitcoin podcaster Stephan Livera, where he explained that Strategy’s track record of growing its Bitcoin per share every 16 to 18 months reduces risk for investors, making the 2x multiple seen in MSTR stock trading “not unreasonable.” He explained that this growth rate means that investors can reach parity with the market net asset value (mNAV) in about a year and a half, effectively de-risking their position. Back pointed out that Strategy’s stock premium—which is currently around 1.7x on a basic share basis and 1.9x on a diluted basis—is backed by a solid asset base. The company has aggressively used leverage through at-the-market equity offerings and convertible senior notes to build up its Bitcoin reserves, now valued at approximately $60.89 billion. Despite MSTR’s recent price decline of 7.45% over the past 30 days, Back held firm that evaluating the time required to “overcome the premium” is a useful lens for investors in Bitcoin treasury stocks. Strategy Bitcoin holdings (Source: Saylor Tracker ) He warned that while elevated mNAVs can be speculative, they also often come with high potential yields. Still, such positions can lead to volatility and investor unease. As an example, he pointed to Japanese firm Metaplanet, which has seen its mNAV fluctuate between 5 and 10. Back acknowledged that holding the stock during such swings could be nerve-wracking, but said the firm has consistently rebounded. Metaplanet recently expanded its Bitcoin holdings to 10,000 BTC after a new purchase on June 16, which allowed it to surpass Coinbase to become the seventh-largest publicly listed Bitcoin holder. France Could Lead Europe’s Bitcoin Future Meanwhile, Jan3 founder Samson Mow is turning his attention to promoting Bitcoin adoption at the nation-state level in Europe, after a promising meeting with pro-Bitcoin French lawmaker and European Parliament member Sarah Knafo at BTC Prague. Mow shared on social media that the two discussed creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for France and pushing for more favorable regulations toward Bitcoin. He is optimistic about launching a wave of nation-state Bitcoin adoption starting in France and potentially spreading across Europe. Knafo said that France must take a leading role in the conversation around Bitcoin. She described her meeting with Mow as an “excellent discussion,” and called him a seasoned expert in national Bitcoin strategies, including his advisory role with El Salvador’s government. Mow resigned from Blockstream in 2022 to focus entirely on Bitcoin nation-state adoption through his company Jan3. He confirmed that his team has been invited to France for further discussions. Knafo also met with Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor, and called him “visionary and ambitious.” He even suggested that more Bitcoin-related projects are on the horizon for France and the broader European region. France has recently shown increasing engagement with Bitcoin through both government and private initiatives. Earlier this month, Paris-based Blockchain Group purchased 624 Bitcoin for €60.2 million, bringing its total holdings to 1,471 BTC. Additionally, France’s state-owned bank Bpifrance announced in March that it would invest €25 million into purchasing cryptocurrencies to support local blockchain projects. Despite these developments, there are still concerns about the pace of crypto adoption across Europe. Some industry leaders argue that the region continues to lag behind other parts of the world due to regulatory hesitation and limited institutional participation. Elisenda Fabrega, general counsel at European RWA tokenization platform Brickken, pointed to a lack of corporate engagement and structural barriers that prevented Bitcoin from being embraced as a reserve asset. The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, while now fully in effect as of December 2024, has yet to fully resolve these issues or lead to widespread adoption across the continent.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9653/michael-saylor-predicts-bitcoin-will-hit-21-m-by-2046,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-06-23T05:52:57,"Ethereum steady at $2,500, but could MUTM pull off a 28x before ETH hits $4K?","The latest on-chain data shows that Ethereum (ETH) is holding strong at around $2,500. This stability is driven by various factors, including a recent uptick in network activity. Data shows that around 1 million new ETH addresses have been created a week since the middle of May 2025. That represents a massive increase from the approximately 670,000 new weekly addresses created in the same period last year. This metric indicates a strong underlying network potential for ETH, which has consolidated around $2,500. According to forecasts, the number of new weekly addresses could keep rising by over 30% annually. That signals growing network adoption and wide ecosystem utility. The number of new addresses is widely used in the crypto sector as a signal of long-term adoption and user growth. As a result, analysts are interpreting the data as a sign of bullish momentum for Ethereum. This suggests demand-side strength is quietly lurking below the surface, and could explode at any time. Amid this trend, investors are positioning themselves to benefit from this massive altcoin rally. One way they are doing this is by purchasing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a promising project that is currently in the presale phase. According to projections, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could rise by 2,850% when it goes live. ETH headed To $4K While the market has been rocked by uncertainty, data shows that ETH is doing better than Bitcoin (BTC). This is a rare occurrence as Ethereum (ETH) tends to be closely correlated to Bitcoin (BTC). Before the current Middle East conflict, Ethereum was outperforming Bitcoin, and has since remained steady, despite the massive market shocks. The resilience, coupled with the positive address data, shows that Ethereum could rise higher. As more capital shifts into Ethereum (ETH), analysts forecast that it could trigger a new altcoin rally. Big investors are already positioning themselves to be the main beneficiaries of this expected rally. For instance, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has recently seen an uptick in participation, with over $10.95 million raised in the ongoing presale. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the perfect buy One reason why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has become a favorite of investors amid the pending altcoin rally is its focus on utility. In the past, the forecast has been on meme coins as investors have tried to cash in on the quick gains they offer. However, investors have come to accept that the only way to reliably grow value in the crypto sector is through utility. A good example of this is Ethereum. Since it went live, the price of ETH has risen 89,000%. Best of all, it continues to rise and consolidate those gains because of utility. Additionally, it has high liquidity, which makes it easy for traders to duck in and out of positions to make a profit. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to follow in those footsteps. The project is built as a decentralized non-custodial protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. As lenders on the protocol, they can deposit assets in a pool to earn interest. The interest rate in pools is based on the pool utilization rate. As the utilization rate rises and the interest rate rises, it pushes borrowers to repay their loans. At the same time, it pushes lenders to deposit more liquidity in the pools to benefit from the rising rates. That leads to a situation where optimal capital efficiency is achieved. Price discovery on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) For Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to achieve market efficiency, pricing needs to be reliable and always accurate. To achieve this, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will implement Chainlink price data oracles, which are a trusted source of data in the DeFi world. Additionally, they plan to implement backup price oracles to ensure there is always a reliable source of data that is accurate when the primary data source is not working. As a redundancy measure, they will implement both oracles to run concurrently. Additionally, they plan to implement the use of time-weighted price averaging as a reference point when there is enough on-chain volume. This data will be sourced from popular DEXs. The goal is to ensure that price discovery on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fair while ensuring the highest uptime possible. MUTM token presale details The MUTM token presale is currently in phase 5, where over $10.95 million has been raised from over 12,350 unique buyers. The presale has been a massive success, even after the 200% increase in the token to $0.03 from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. So far, 45% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 of the presale have been sold, barely two weeks after they launched. With less than 60% of the tokens remaining in phase 5, this is your last chance to get Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens at a massive 50% off the token listing price of $0.06. Act fast and position yourself to benefit from the upcoming altcoin rally.

2025-06-23T05:25:27,"MSTE:CA: Better Off Owning MSTR Directly, Hold","Summary MSTE offers leveraged exposure to MicroStrategy and monthly income via covered calls, but adds complexity and extra fees versus owning MSTR directly. We remain bullish on Bitcoin and MSTR as a proxy, viewing both as hedges against fiat currency and global instability. The fund's strategy only outperforms within a limited price range for MSTR; outside this, plain MSTR ownership has historically delivered better returns. Given the limited incremental benefit and added risks, we rate MSTE as a hold until clearer value over direct MSTR ownership emerges. Introduction The Harvest MicroStrategy Enhanced High Income Shares ETF (MSTE:CA) is a Canadian fund that aims to invest its assets into Class A shares of MicroStrategy ( MSTR ). This company formerly was a software and business intelligence focused firm, but nowadays is more well known for its Bitcoin dominated balance sheet, due to its large holdings in this cryptocurrency. This fund looks to both provide access to the upside of MSTR while also giving investors consistent income from distributions - paid out monthly. Total leverage of the fund goes up to 25% and its investable units are denominated in CAD. Below are some details of the fund from its prospectus . Distribution : $0.66 / month AUM : $179.3M Management Fee : 0.40% Being that the main holding of this ETF is MSTR, a company that we like due to it being a proxy for Bitcoin, we are inherently bullish on the underlying company. We will review some points above MSTR in the following section that dictate our thoughts about the company. MicroStrategy Company Review MSTR is known for buying and holding Bitcoin (BTC-USD) on its balance sheet. The company has announced a plan to continue buying this cryptocurrency, outlining a long-term plan to continually invest further in Bitcoin through its 42-42 plan by 2027. The firm reveals that the money to fund these purchases would occur through both equity and debt raises, as well as the current operating cash flows generated by the firm itself. This plan entails details such as goals of $42B in equity and $42B in fixed income capital raises by the end of 2027, which should continue to fund its investments in Bitcoin. Furthermore, the company is leveraging its continual offerings of preferred shares , which offer high rates, to attract investors to the company and therefore generate even more cash for them to exchange into Bitcoin. Essentially, MSTR is becoming more and more of a Bitcoin hedge fund in a sense, where investors can view their investments in MSTR as a bullish play on Bitcoin (and crypto markets in general). Currently, MSTR holds a total of 592,100 Bitcoins , with an average BTC cost of ~$70,666. In nominal values, they have spent roughly $42B on their Bitcoin purchases over the years. The following chart shows the buying cadence (every week) and amount bought for YTD 2025. MSTR Bitcoin Purchases ( MicroStrategy ) We view MSTR as a great hedge against fiat currencies and also as a stable hedge against chaos happening across the world today. For example, the firm recently bought more BTC during the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, betting that the conflict and funding for it might boost the price of BTC. Ultimately, an investment in MSTR means that you have faith and believe in the market changing dynamics of Bitcoin. It may be that you view it as a hedge, truly do not believe in the current traditional finance systems, or a bit of both. Either way, Bitcoin’s influence on global financial markets cannot be understated and should be respected as an asset with both utility (in terms of transactions) and a hedge (against fiat currencies and as a store of value). It should be mentioned, however, that MSTR as a holding company of BTC frequently trades at a premium in terms of performance compared to buying BTC outright. Look at the below chart, for example, comparing YTD returns on BTC and MSTR. MSTR vs BTC YTD Performance (Yahoo Finance) The top blue represents MSTR, and BTC is the red line. With nearly a ~19% delta in YTD performance, one has to consider whether MSTR is an overvalued way to gain exposure to the underlying BTC asset. Either way, it would appear that the market places a premium on the leader, Michael Saylor, and his vision of what MSTR can do with their vast BTC holdings. In summary, we are bullish on the future of BTC, and therefore, MSTR. With this ETF holding MSTR and providing stable, recurring income from it, we also are therefore bullish on the future of this fund. However, there are risks and considerations stemming from the leverage and covered call elements of the fund that we will cover in the next section. Covered Calls and Leverage MSTE utilizes both leveraged and covered calls in order to increase overall returns for investors. Their goal is to have the fund be up to 25% leveraged and write covered calls on up to 50% of the fund . Currently, the fund is 22.8% leveraged . For the purpose of this analysis, we assume the fund is split up like so: 25% is 2x leveraged. For now, we assume that there is no interest cost related to the leveraging 50% is not leveraged but has covered calls written against it 25% just owns MSTE directly Let’s explore a scenario: The fund owns 200 shares of MSTR that were bought at $100 per share. 50 additional shares were bought on leverage. The fund has sold covered calls on 100 shares at a strike price of $125 for total proceeds of $500 Scenario Description Gain/Loss on MSTR Gain/Loss on Option Total Gain/Loss Without Leverage/Options No movement MSTR does not move at all. $0 $500 $500 $0 Mildly Up MSTR ends up at a price of $110 $2,500 $500 $3,000 $2,000 Mildly Down MSTR ends up at a price of $90 -$2,500 $500 -$2,000 -$2,000 Very Up MSTR ends up at a price of $160 $11,500 ($2,500 on covered call shares, $9,000 on the rest) $500 $12,000 $12,000 Very Down MSTR ends up at a price of $50 -$12,500 $500 -$12,000 -$10,000 It’s hard to see exactly how the leverage and options impact returns, as they sometimes impact the returns in the same direction (positive or negative) and sometimes have an opposite (but not always equal) impact. A few rules of thumb: If the stock price remains at or below the strike price, then the covered call strategy will result in higher returns (compared to if you did not sell the calls). If the stock price goes above the strike price, then investors will see positive returns, but the returns would be higher if you had not sold the calls. Leverage amplifies both gains and losses. So if the stock price increases, you make more profit but if the stock price decreases you make less profit (both relative to a non-leveraged scenario). Let’s talk about the “Very Up” strategy. In the above scenario, the returns from having the covered calls and leverage are the same as if you had not done either. This is because the covered calls are decreasing potential returns by $3,000 while the leverage is increasing potential returns by $3,000. To be clear, these impacts will not always be equal. If instead the scenario was that the stock increased to $170, the total returns would be $13,000 while returns without leverage/options would be $14,000. MSTE gains with and without leverage/options (Doodad Capital) Above is a chart that visualizes the overall scenario. There are 3 main sections: $0 - $90: Investors are better off without the calls + leverage $90 - $160: Investors are better off using the calls + leverage $160+: Investors are better off without the calls + leverage So why are $90 and $160 the two points where the outcome flips? These are both points where the red and blue lines are exactly the same. This is because the negative impacts of leveraging are exactly canceled out by positive impacts of the calls (for the $90 case) or the positive impacts of leveraging are exactly canceled out by negative impacts of the calls (for the $160 case). These intersection points will change depending on various factors such as the call strike price, premium and interest costs of the leverage. For example, if instead the premium from selling the call was $1000, the intersection points would instead be at $80 and $170 instead. The key takeaway here is that investors in this kind of strategy would ideally see the stock price stay between the 2 intersection points. Otherwise, they would have larger returns without the additional call options and leverage. Finally, let’s talk about leverage interest. Since leveraging is a kind of debt, there will be an additional interest cost related to it. In this scenario, we borrowed enough cash to buy 50 shares of MSTR at $100 per share, resulting in a total debt of $5,000. The easy way to think about impacts of interest is that it changes the width of the range between the 2 intersection points. More interest would mean a narrower range, while less interest would result in a wider range. For example, with additional interest of $500, the range narrows from $90 - $160 to $100 - $150. Risks A key risk is BTC volatility. Being a cryptocurrency, it can sometimes be very volatile, as we all know. Therefore, the price of MSTR could also be impacted by swings in the price of BTC, as they are now so tied together. With a beta of 3.76 , this is a name that moves significantly compared to the market. This would be a risk that investors should keep in mind regarding the stability of their portfolio, and could therefore be a trade for more risk-tolerant investors. Another risk to consider is the additional cost of owning this ETF. Investors pay additional management fees as well as indirectly the leverage interest fees. All of this is fine if the returns outweigh the costs, but investors need to weigh the additional cost/complexity against the additional potential return they could gain. As we discussed, investors in this kind of strategy only make a profit if the share price ends up within a certain range, which limits the overall benefit of the fund. As you can see below, since inception, MSTE has actually lagged behind MSTR in returns by ~2% (the below chart is dividend adjusted, so proceeds from the covered call strategy are included). Investors could have saved on fees and the additional complexity by just buying MSTR instead. MSTR vs MSTE Returns (Stock Rover) Finally, we should also mention that while this fund is not very highly levered, it does have some leverage which could pose an additional risk. With leveraged investments, your losses could quickly compound, leading to potentially very large losses. Conclusion We are bullish on the future of BTC as we view it as a hedge against the traditional financial markets and as a safe haven in the event of conflicts around the world. Despite the risks and volatility associated with BTC, long-term, we believe that the currency will rise. For MSTE, it is interesting to see dual-features of it, offering both upside potential via leverage and recurring income via covered calls. However, we are not convinced if this additional complexity is providing enough value back to investors given the maintenance fee. The additional returns from the strategy are limited to only a specific window of price movement for MSTR and, as we showed, so far, investors would have been better off just owning MSTR. Until we see more evidence of incremental benefit from MSTE, we rate it as a hold.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4796441-msteca-better-off-owning-mstr-directly-hold?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","MSTR|BTC-USD|MSTE:CA",cryptocompare

Bitcoin slipped below $99,000, with Ethereum and other major altcoins following suit. Pi Coin also plunged 11%, nearing its all-time low, before a slight 0.55% rebound today. June’s 263 million token unlock continues to weigh heavily on Pi’s price , fueling selling pressure and investor concerns. Why Is #PiNetwork Price Low Right Now? Will It Rise Again?

When these giants fall, the whole market feels it.… pic.twitter.com/8f48DaHzCV — Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis (@drnicolas_) June 22, 2025 However, Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis , the founder of Pi Network, has responded to concerns about the falling Pi price, attributing it to the broader crypto market correction. He pointed out that major assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana have also seen notable declines, impacting the overall market mood. So, Pi’s dip isn’t an isolated event, but it could be a part of a global trend. Temporary Dip, Long-Term Vision According to him, despite the bloodbath, Pi Network stands out with a unique setup. The project is in its Enclosed Mainnet phase, meaning it isn’t yet publicly tradable. Despite that, Kokkalis emphasized strong fundamentals, including over 50 million users, a growing ecosystem of real-world applications , and steady development. He reassured the Pi community, known as Pioneers, that what’s happening isn’t a crash but a transitional phase. Kokkalis believes the token’s true value will emerge once the Open Mainnet launches and Pi is listed on major exchanges. He framed the current situation as an accumulation phase, often misunderstood as weakness. For now, he urges users to stay patient and focused, noting that utility-based growth is already underway. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Network Founder Slammed as ‘Scammer’ for Defending Price Crash; He Responds , Analyst says, Prices to Stay Low Pi is officially in the $0.4 range, and I expect it to remain there until the end of August.

He believes the upcoming Pi Day 2 event is unlikely to influence the price, signaling low expectations for short-term momentum despite community buzz. What next? Much of the hype surrounds June 28, which marks Pi Day 2 and the conclusion of the .pi domain auction. Over 123,000 active bids have sparked optimism about ecosystem growth. While the Core Team hasn’t confirmed any updates, the market is anticipating something. Historically, Pi has rallied around such events, as seen with its 175% jump in May. However, caution remains due to the July 1 unlock of 40 million PI tokens, which could weigh on prices. For now, Pi is showing signs of strength, briefly decoupling from Bitcoin’s broader decline, driven by technical support and event-driven momentum. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Over the past week, Bitcoin has fluctuated with traders closely monitoring geopolitical developments and on-chain data, such as short-term holders selling at a loss and liquidity clustering near $106K, for signs of a decisive breakout. While Bitcoin hasn’t acted as a traditional safe haven amid the crisis, its stability amid risk-off conditions suggests possible accumulation beneath the surface. Amid this backdrop of moderate volatility and macro uncertainty, all eyes are turning toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance official presale has the token set at $0.03 in Phase 5. Already 200% higher since presale went live, Mutuum Finance will launch at $0.06 officially, giving current buyers a minimum return on investment of 100%. Mutuum Finance has surged past $11 million in funding at a price of $0.03, backed by CertiK auditing, a stablecoin initiative, and a gamified rewards system. Mutuum Finance presale took up pace as investor mania rocks After an immediate Phase 4 sellout, the project is currently at Phase 5, selling tokens at $0.03. The phase also brings with it the potential 16.67% return on investment for investors since the price will increase in the next phase. Over 12,300 investors have already joined the presale so far, injecting over $11 million, unequivocal proof of growing trust in Mutuum Finance’s vision and future prospects. With its game-changing dual-lending platform and upcoming USD-pegged stablecoin, Mutuum Finance stands out in the crypto market, not through hype, but through actual utility and security at scale. The future is rosy, and the new features have enormous potential where Mutuum Finance will be part of the best altcoin investment options. Smart tokenomics make Mutuum Finance stand out Mutuum finance is intended to be long-term. Its Buy-and-Distribute feature will purchase tokens from the market every so often and redistributes them to the stakers. This rewards long-term holding, domesticates volatility in the market, and makes the token’s value, so long-term dedicated investors enjoy a stupendous advantage in the long run. Stablecoin release and CertiK auditing grant institutional legitimacy Mutuum Finance’s much-anticipated launch of a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum is one of the steady solid pillars in this vision. It’s designed to endure market cycles and provide a stable alternative to failed algorithmic stablecoins that destabilized previous DeFi ecosystems. Mutuum Finance has even had a rigorous deep smart contract audit performed by CertiK, one of the most highly regarded cybersecurity firms in the blockchain ecosystem. $100K in leaderboard & giveaway prizes up for grabs Mutuum Finance is celebrating its fast-paced growth and thanking early bird fans by creating a $100,000 giveaway . Ten winners will receive $10,000’s worth of MUTM tokens, simply for signing up early. In addition, the project has also introduced a live leaderboard, and the top 50 MUTM token holders will be awarded special bonus rewards, adding a gamified touch to the presale and making it more fun to join. As Bitcoin (BTC) holds strong above $100,000 amid geopolitical uncertainty, the spotlight is shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a top altcoin buy. With over $11 million raised from 12,300+ investors and a Phase 5 presale price of $0.03, early adopters are already positioned for a 100% return by the $0.06 launch. Backed by a CertiK audit, a dual lending system, and an upcoming stablecoin, MUTM combines real utility with massive upside potential.

2025-06-23T04:47:48,"Bitcoin Holds Key Support; Oil Disappoints 'Doomers' as Brent and WTI Erase Early Price Gains","American poet Charles Bukowski famously said: ""The crowd is always wrong,"" and his words seem to sum up the situation in the financial markets perfectly. Just 24 hours ago, social media was abuzz with fears that the U.S. airstrike on Iran's nuclear sites, combined with the talk of Iran mulling the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, will trigger a massive surge in oil prices, leading to a slide in stocks and cryptocurrencies. The reality, however, has turned out to be different. Oil prices on both sides of the Atlantic gapped higher by just 3% and have since erased most of the gains, according to data source TradingView. As of writing, a barrel of Brent oil changed hands at $77, up just 1.4% for the day. Prices gapped higher to hit a five-month high of $77.79. Similarly, the West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) hit a high of $78.58 before falling back to $76.75. Meanwhile, bitcoin BTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has risen back above $101,000, having hit lows under $98,000 on Sunday when fears of an oil price spike led to the short-term Deribit-listed BTC puts trading at an 8%-10% volatility premium to calls. Futures tied to the S&P 500 traded just 0.3% lower. The largely muted reaction in oil prices suggests that the market doesn't expect Iran to follow through on its threats and block the Strait of Hormuz, which could destabilize its key allies in Asia, particularly China. ""Price action this morning suggests that the market doesn’t believe (at least not yet) that flows through Hormuz will be blocked. Brent is back below $80/bbl after briefly spiking above this level earlier in the trading session,"" analysts at ING said in a report to clients Monday. ""With more than 80% of oil flows through Hormuz ending up in Asia, the impact on the region would be larger than that on the US. Therefore, Iran would want to be careful in upsetting the likes of China by disrupting oil flows,"" ING added. According to energy market expert Anas Alhajji, Iran's threat to close the Strait is largely a rhetorical tactic for domestic consumption, which it has employed at least 15 times since the 1980s. Alhajji explained the same in a post on X , revisiting the 2018 thread that detailed how blocking the strait is easier said than done. ""For Iran to close the Strait, it means occupation and the taking over of Oman's waters where most ships go through. This will immediately invoke the defence pact of the GCC: it means war among all,"" the thread said, adding that a potential closure would hurt Iran's friends more than its enemies, which do not import oil from Iran and could circumvent the Strait through two underutilized pipelines. BTC holds key support All this means that the much-feared oil price spike may not materialize soon, which could help BTC and other risk assets avoid a sell-off. A big surge in oil would increase the risk of major economies slipping into stagflation, the worst outcome for most assets, including bitcoin. BTC's chart shows that bears failed to establish a foothold below the horizontal support at $100,430 on Sunday. Buyers stepped in around that level on June 5, taking prices higher to $110,000 in subsequent days. Oil's muted reaction suggests the potential for history to repeat itself. On the flip side, acceptance under the support would shift the focus to the confluence of the 100- and 200-day simple moving averages at around $95,900.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/23/bitcoin-holds-key-support-oil-disappoints-doomers-as-brent-and-wti-erase-early-price-gains,"ASIA|BTC|COMMODITY|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Oil|Markets|Iran|News",cryptocompare

Metaplanet’s total stash has grown nearly 28-fold since December 2024. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 1,111 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 11,111 BTC* pic.twitter.com/7ceEeSh1X4 — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) June 23, 2025 Metaplanet Reports Quarter to Date BTC Yield of 107.9% Metaplanet reports a quarter-to-date BTC yield of 107.9%, up from 95.6% in Q1 and 309.8% in Q4 2024.

The firm also posted a BTC gain of 4,367 BTC for $451.2 million for the ongoing quarter, based on reference prices from Bitflyer. The company has funded its Bitcoin purchases through a series of capital market activities, including multiple zero-coupon bond issuances and equity-based instruments. Since January, Metaplanet has issued and redeemed more than a dozen series of ordinary bonds and stock acquisition rights, largely subscribed by EVO FUND . Over 210 million shares have been issued under its “210 Million Plan.” Metaplanet Wants to Buy 210,000 BTC by 2027 Often dubbed as Japan’s Strategy, the company aims to buy 210,000 Bitcoins by the end 2027.

The company formalized Bitcoin Treasury Operations as a core business line in December 2024, a pivot from its hotel management business. Since then, it has disclosed regular updates on its BTC position, including total holdings, cost basis, and share dilution metrics. As of June 23, Metaplanet’s fully diluted share count stood at 759 million, with Bitcoin per 1,000 fully diluted shares reaching 0.0146 BTC.

The price of Pi Coin recently dropped below $0.50, even testing $0.47 before making a slight recovery. At the time of writing, Pi is trying to hold above $0.50, which has become an important support level. But it’s not just Pi facing tough times. Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum also took a hit as tensions between the U.S. and Iran increased. Bitcoin even fell below $100,000 for the first time in months. Founder Steps In to Calm Supporters As Pi’s price continued to drop, Pi Network founder Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis took to social media to address worried investors, known as Pioneers. He assured them that this is just a temporary market phase, not a permanent crash. However, not everyone was convinced. One frustrated user commented, “Are you a scammer or a fraud? Does Pi fall every day? Support Pi and raise it.” To this, Dr. Kokkalis replied, “Do you know about crypto? Why are other cryptos going down?” But the user wasn’t satisfied and said, “Since I bought Pi, it has been falling. I’ve seen 3 ups and 5 downs. I have no confidence in Pi anymore. I will cut my losses and won’t invest in companies like yours.” Is Pi Headed Below $0.40? Currently, Pi Coin is under pressure. Experts say it will need a positive market shift to rise above $0.60.

The firm, which manages 14,200 rental units and half a million square feet of A-grade office space, aims to diversify its holdings by integrating Bitcoin’s potential for long-term value growth with its real estate assets. Cardone highlighted its strategy’s ambition, stating plans to acquire an additional 3,000 BTC. The firm also eyes 5,000 rental units by the end of 2025. This dual-expansion model reflects confidence in Bitcoin’s stability as a hedge against inflation, despite the recent geopolitical unrest.

2025-06-23T03:30:10,"Bitcoin Crashed Below $100,000 Amid US Airstrikes On Iran And Market Sell-Off","The market’s leading crypto, Bitcoin (BTC), dipped below the $100,000 mark for the first time in over a month on Sunday, following US airstrikes on Iran as conflicts in the middle east continue to escalate. This decline, which saw the Bitcoin price drop approximately 4% to around $99,300, coincided with a broader market sell-off, with Ethereum (ETH) experiencing an even sharper decline of nearly 10%. Overall, the total cryptocurrency market took a significant hit, falling about 7% in just 24 hours. Geopolitical Unrest And Tariff Troubles The timing of this downturn was particularly notable, occurring just hours after the US targeted three key nuclear sites in Iran. Tensions had escalated following a United Nations report that indicated Iran was not adhering to international prohibitions against developing a military nuclear program. In response to these revelations, Israel conducted strikes against Iran, leading to further retaliation from the Islamic Republic. On Saturday, President Donald Trump declared on social media: This is an HISTORIC MOMENT FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ISRAEL, AND THE WORLD. IRAN MUST NOW AGREE TO END THIS WAR. THANK YOU! Related Reading: Solana Cracks Below Key Structure – Head And Shoulders Breakdown Points To $106 This recent plummet below the psychologically significant $100,000 threshold follows a year of substantial gains for Bitcoin. After Trump took office in January, Bitcoin reached all-time highs above $100,000 in February, buoyed by executive orders aimed at supporting the cryptocurrency sector. However, the cryptocurrency’s price soon mirrored the broader declines in financial markets, particularly after Trump announced severe tariffs in April, which saw Bitcoin fall to nearly $75,000, its lowest point in 2025. Despite this volatility, Bitcoin had seen a resurgence, particularly in May when it reached new highs as Wall Street investors returned to the cryptocurrency through US exchange-traded funds (ETFs). However, by late Sunday, there were signs of recovery, with Bitcoin trading approximately at $101,300, down only 1% over the previous day, while ETH managed to pare its losses to around $2,200. Forced Liquidations Exacerbate Bitcoin Sell-Off According to CNBC, Iran has also threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial shipping route responsible for approximately 20% of the global oil supply, further adding to the broader financial uncertainty. JPMorgan warned that such a blockade could drive oil prices up to $130 per barrel, which would have significant implications for US inflation, potentially pushing it back toward 5%—a level not seen since March 2023. While Bitcoin has often been promoted as an inflation hedge, its recent behavior aligns more closely with that of high-beta tech stocks. Data from crypto provider Kaiko indicates that Bitcoin’s correlation with the tech-heavy Nasdaq has increased sharply in recent weeks, particularly following the surge in inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. Related Reading: $312M ETH Transfer Triggers Sell-Off Fears As Ethereum Price Crashes Below Support Institutional investment patterns have also shifted. More than $1.04 billion flowed into spot Bitcoin ETFs from Monday to Wednesday last week, but this momentum dissipated as the weekend approached, with minimal net movement on Thursday and only $6.4 million on Friday. The technical aspects of the market further exacerbated the sell-off. Research from CoinGlass revealed that Bitcoin’s drop below $99,000 triggered forced liquidations across offshore derivatives platforms, including Binance and Bybit. During this period, over $1 billion in crypto positions were liquidated within 24 hours, with more than 95% of these coming from long positions, highlighting the market’s overexposure.

That has triggered violent selloffs across every major market, from stocks to Bitcoin, from oil to the dollar and the euro. The world’s financial system is now reacting like it just got sucker punched. Its unlike anything we have ever seen. Oil was first to go wild. In the first trading session after the futures market opened, US crude rose $1.76, or 2.38%, to $75.60 per barrel. Brent crude climbed $1.80, or 2.34%, landing at $78.81. Brent even briefly touched $81, which was a 5.7% spike, before it slipped back. By press time, the price gains were gone. Oil was down 0.5%, which made no sense to anyone watching. Traders are now locked on Tehran, waiting to see what it does next. Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, Iran’s foreign minister, said Sunday that Iran reserves “ all options ” to defend its sovereignty. S&P Global Platts noted the price surge could reverse entirely if Iran chooses not to respond. Bitcoin dives, rebounds, then tanks again as ETF flows collapse The crypto market didn’t waste a second. Bitcoin had dropped to $98,000 on Sunday. That was its lowest point in over a month. Less than an hour later, it swung back above $102,000, before slipping again. At the time of writing, it sat at $100,879. The market was a disaster. More than $1 billion in crypto positions were liquidated in just 24 hours, and over 95% were long bets. Source: TradingView Things got uglier when inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs dried up. Between Monday and Wednesday, $1.04 billion had gone in, based on CoinGlass data. But by Thursday, that number was flat. On Friday, just $6.4 million came in. That was the same day President Donald Trump left the G7 early and announced a two-week review of US options on Iran. The assumption that Bitcoin would act like a safe haven collapsed. It started trading like a risky tech stock instead. Kaiko, a crypto data provider, said Bitcoin’s correlation with the Nasdaq had surged quite fast in recent weeks. Stock indexes bleed across Asia, Europe, and US futures Futures tied to US stocks also started dropping. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 109 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 futures lost 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.4%. Asian markets opened deep in the red too. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 dropped 0.56%, and the Topix fell 0.49%. The worst-hit companies were all in tech: Screen Holdings crashed 4.78%, Lasertec Corp sank 4.31%, and Disco Corp went down 3.38%. Big names like Advantest and Softbank didn’t escape either, falling 1.66% and 0.76%. It was the same story in South Korea. The Kospi index lost 1.05%. The Kosdaq, which includes smaller-cap companies, got hit even harder, down 1.78%. The country’s top automakers took the brunt. Hyundai Motor shares dropped 4.05%, and Kia Corp fell 4.15%. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 also took a dive, down 0.76%. In Hong Kong, futures for the Hang Seng Index pointed to more losses. They stood at 23,396, well below the index’s last close of 23,530.48, suggesting more downside ahead. Japanese carmakers had no luck either. As of press time, Nissan Motor dropped 2.22%, and Mazda Motor was down 2.17%. Mitsubishi Motors lost 1.87%, Honda Motor slid 1.55%, and Toyota dropped 1.36%. Over in Europe, markets weren’t much better. The IBEX 35 rose 0.77%, closing at 13,850.3, and Germany’s DAX jumped 1.27% to 23,350.55. But the FTSE in London dropped 0.2% to 8,774.65, and France’s CAC 40 was completely flat at 7,589.66. The STOXX600, a broader European index, barely moved, up just 0.13% to 536.53. And the euro was trading at $1.15 against the dollar after going as high as $1.8 just an hour ago.

2025-06-23T01:36:19,"Asia Morning Briefing: BTC Reclaims $100K as Markets Shrug off Iran Strike","Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins the trading week, bitcoin BTC is trading above $100,500 as the initial volatility from news over the weekend that the U.S. struck some of Iran's nuclear facilities begins to subside. While prices briefly dipped below six figures on Sunday in a risk-off reaction , markets have since stabilized. Equity futures are flat, and gold is up only marginally, suggesting that traders are not yet pricing in a broader escalation. The lack of follow-through in traditional markets may reflect expectations that Iran’s response will be contained or delayed, rather than immediate and destabilizing. Crude oil is holding its gains near $76 per barrel after spiking nearly 4% Sunday evening on fears that Iran could block the Strait of Hormuz, a key chokepoint for global oil shipments. Still, commentary from U.S. officials and muted early-week trading suggest that investors remain in a wait-and-see mode. In crypto markets, altcoins that had mirrored BTC’s weekend drop, like ether ETH, XRP XRP, and solana's SOL SOL, are also clawing back losses. For now, the market appears to be treating the U.S.-Iran clash as a geopolitical flashpoint, not a structural break. OKX Considering U.S. IPO: Report Crypto exchange OKX is considering a public listing in the U.S., according to a report from The Information . Earlier this year, the exchange announced a U.S. expansion after settling with the Department of Justice over accusations that it operated in the country without a money transmitter license. Among other crypto-linked companies, Bullish, a competitor to OKX and the parent company of CoinDesk, is also said to be considering an IPO given investors' appetite for companies with exposure to digital assets. OKX told CoinDesk it had no comment on the matter. Polymarket Bettors Less Certain About Second U.S. Strike on Iran Polymarket bettors are cooling to the idea that the U.S will hit Iran a second time before the end of the month. The 'yes' side of a contract asking if the U.S. will conduct another military action on Iran by June 30 is now trading at 54%, from 74% in the hours after the initial strike on Iranian nuclear sites. There appears to be a growing market belief that deconfliction – on both sides – is on the agenda, as evidenced by another contract asking bettors about the likelihood of Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz, which is currently trading at 49% down from 52% . Market Movements: BTC : Bitcoin rebounded to $101,419 after a volatile 4.5% intraday swing, finding strong support at $99,000 amid geopolitical tensions and surging institutional buying interest, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data. ETH: Ethereum fell 2.3% to $2,237 amid U.S.-Iran tensions, breaking a six-week consolidation pattern despite over $500 million in institutional accumulation. Gold: Bank of America analysts predict gold could hit $4,000 an ounce within a year, an 18% jump, driven less by geopolitical tensions and more by mounting U.S. fiscal debt and a global shift by central banks away from the dollar toward gold. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets fell Monday as the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites fueled oil price spikes and fears of broader Middle East escalation, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 0.56%.
