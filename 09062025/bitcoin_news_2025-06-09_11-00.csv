2025-06-09T08:50:28,"Europe’s First Bitcoin Treasury Firm Plans $340M BTC Buy","The post Europe’s First Bitcoin Treasury Firm Plans $340M BTC Buy appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Paris-based Blockchain Group is stepping up its Bitcoin game in a big way. The company has announced plans to raise €300 million (around $340 million) to grow its Bitcoin treasury – marking one of the boldest crypto moves yet by a European firm. Already holding over $154 million in Bitcoin, Blockchain Group is now aiming to more than double down. It calls itself Europe’s first dedicated Bitcoin treasury company, and this new raise positions it to play a bigger role in shaping institutional crypto adoption across the region. The way they’re raising funds, who they’re partnering with, and what it says about Europe’s crypto market – it’s all worth a closer look. While the U.S. dominates headlines, Europe might be quietly setting up its own Bitcoin power players. Here’s what you must know. Borrowing from Wall Street’s Playbook Here’s what makes the move even more interesting – the structure of the raise. Inspired by the U.S. market’s At-The-Market (ATM) model, Blockchain Group will sell shares directly at market prices, in tranches, and only under certain limits. The shares won’t be dumped all at once, but released gradually, based on the previous day’s closing price or the volume-weighted average price, whichever is higher. There’s also a cap: no more than 21% of that day’s trading volume. It’s a mechanism designed to raise capital while maintaining market balance. The company plans to start small, with €500,000, and scale from there. This kind of fundraising isn’t commonly seen in European crypto firms. So, yes, it’s a clear sign that Blockchain Group wants to break out of the local mold and start playing on a much larger field. With TOBAM on Board, the Stakes Just Got Highe r The Blockchain Group isn’t going at it alone. It’s teamed up with TOBAM, a well-known asset manager, to handle the capital raise and ensure the funds are used smartly. TOBAM will help direct the new capital toward growth and profit-generating strategies. This move is about long-term business development with Bitcoin as the strategic core. Love to see it. Strategic Vision Comes from the Top Alexandre Laizet, the company’s Deputy CEO and head of Bitcoin strategy, has been vocal about the raise on social media. He’s made it clear: this is about more than just growing the treasury. It’s about global expansion. He mentioned that the company does not waver in managing Bitcoin investments, pointing to the group’s firm focus on yield and results. He believes the ATM program will further cement the company’s role as a top player in Europe’s Bitcoin market. Valentin Kosanovic echoed the sentiment, calling the program a major step forward for the company’s global operations. For him, it’s about staying laser-focused – “121%,” in his words – on making Bitcoin a core driver of value. Move Aside, MicroStrategy! The timing is telling. Just days ago, MicroStrategy, still the largest corporate Bitcoin holder in the world, announced plans to raise $1 billion for more Bitcoin. Blockchain Group’s raise may be smaller, but it signals that Europe isn’t sitting this one out. Meanwhile, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have been seeing outflows – over $47 million on June 6 alone. But firms like Blockchain Group are pushing forward anyway, not reacting to short-term moves, but acting on long-term conviction. With this new capital program, Blockchain Group is raising the stakes for institutional crypto strategy in Europe. We’re excited for what’s next.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/europes-first-bitcoin-treasury-firm-plans-340m-btc-buy/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-09T08:47:22,"Hyperliquid whales are stocking up on HYPE, pricing in another breakout rally","Whales are back to buying Hyperliquid’s HYPE token, awaiting a breakout as the token hovers close to its higher range. At least three whale wallets were spotted taking HYPE positions in recent days. Attention for Hyperliquid is increasing, as three more whale wallets accumulated HYPE. The token recovered to $34.88, still within a small rally to its all-time peak. Two whales allocated a total of $3.5M to acquire HYPE above $35. The buying happened on-chain, raising demand for spot HYPE. The whales acquired HYPE in a series of spot purchases. The third whale placed a limit buy order at $24.95, betting on a potential correction. According to Nansen, the whales are generally high-balance traders, with previous records of meme token buying. Most of their other balances are relatively small compared to their HYPE positions. The whales were not active on the derivative market, only buying spot HYPE. One of the buyers with over 224.2M HYPE was ranked 81st based on his whale-sized holdings. HYPE still traded near its three-month high, as the perpetual futures DEX continued to build its influence. The whale buying coincided with a small expansion of open interest to $1.39B. The open interest on HYPE trends toward long positions, at over 53% of all trades. The native HYPE token is used for rewards and liquidity, but recently also gained a position as a meme token. HYPE also expects some irrational buying and enthusiasm, in place of other memes. The token has relatively small insider holdings and is not threatened by selling pressure from VC backers. The token gains attention from the role of Hyperliquid in the crypto ecosystem. Public whale positions and trades, completely transparent with on-chain execution, are actually signaling the available liquidity on the DEX. HYPE expected to benefit from Hyperliquid growth One of the narratives for HYPE is that it would peak and crash. Hyperliquid achieved peak volumes and liquidity in May, coinciding with the token’s price records. In June, the question remains whether Hyperliquid can retain its growth pace or face a setback. Hyperliquid searches on Google slowed down, though HYPE saw a small uptick in interest. Searches for HYPE had an uptick, as the asset remains closely watched for its irrational rally potential. | Source: Google Trends Additionally, Hyperliquid lost some of its stablecoin liquidity. Since the peak 2.9B USDC in May, the available liquidity is down to $2.72B. In June to date, the DEX carried $45B in volumes, following the peak of over $248B in May. Hyperliquid is still gaining on Binance, currently making up around 45% of the spot volume on the leading centralized exchange. James Wynn still posts Hyperliquid positions The risky trader James Wynn still posts his high-leverage positions, though this time, posting a much smaller collateral. Previously, Wynn had been liquidated for $100M, but has currently switched to positions in the hundreds of dollars, mostly serving as engagement bait. Update: My $468.62 short position is in the hole approx $78.07c. #PrayForJamesWynn This is all I have. https://t.co/FVsrXVXmRh pic.twitter.com/F6RnTjaUJR — James Wynn (@JamesWynnReal) June 8, 2025 Previously, Wynn also explained that Hyperliquid was not paying or offering any rewards for his trading moves, despite the fact that they drew more attention to the DEX. Wynn admitted he only received around $34,000 from referrals. Currently, Wynn is still bullish on BTC, expecting a big breakout, while also promoting the Moonpig meme token.

2025-06-09T08:40:04,"Early Bitcoin Adopter to XRP Holders: Don’t Sell Your XRP for This Elon Musk Reason","An early Bitcoin adopter and crypto enthusiast, Pumpius issued a direct warning to XRP holders, urging them not to sell their assets amid what he describes as an orchestrated distraction involving public tensions between Elon Musk and Donald Trump. His tweet emphasizes that the perceived feud is not merely a spectacle, but rather a calculated diversion hiding a much deeper shift in the financial world. Pumpius began his statement with a strong message : “DON’T SELL YOUR $XRP. Not now. Not during this.” He dismissed the Elon vs Trump conflict as a distraction, characterizing it as “the smoke hiding something much bigger.” According to his view, this high-profile public drama is not organic or accidental, but rather part of a broader strategy designed to manipulate investor behavior during a pivotal transition in the financial system. Engineered Volatility and Distraction Tactics He pointed to a historic pattern: when billionaires engage in public disputes, significant developments are often unfolding behind the scenes. He contends that “market volatility is engineered” and “narratives are weaponized,” suggesting that media coverage and public debate are being used intentionally to steer the attention of retail investors away from structural changes happening in global finance. For Pumpius, these tactics are aimed at distracting and dividing investors so that they miss critical signals about the evolving financial landscape. DON’T SELL YOUR $XRP . Not now. Not during this. Elon vs Trump isn’t a distraction. It’s the smoke hiding something much bigger. And if you sell now, you’ll be exit liquidity for the next financial reset. Let me explain. pic.twitter.com/QvVyxW6lve — Pumpius (@pumpius) June 6, 2025 XRP’s Strategic Role in the New Financial System Central to his argument is the role of XRP. Pumpius stressed that XRP is not just a digital token, but rather a critical component of what he calls the “backbone of institutional liquidity rails.” He referenced recent developments, including regulatory approval for XRP in Dubai, the integration of RippleNet with central banks, the launch of RLUSD (Ripple’s new stablecoin), and the alignment of scheduled escrow unlocks with current global instability. According to the Pundit, these developments point to a broader transformation in cross-border financial infrastructure, for which XRP is designed. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Retail Exit Pressure as the Financial Reset Approaches He insisted that these events are not coincidental. “Musk vs Trump = perfect trigger,” he wrote, asserting that the clash is being used to “divide the retail crowd” and “suppress attention on what actually matters.” In his view, while investors are preoccupied with media narratives, the infrastructure for a new financial system is quietly being activated. Pumpius argued that the underlying goal is not to acquire XRP from retail holders, but rather to shake them out of their positions. He stated that engineered distractions are designed to instill fear, uncertainty, and doubt, leading individuals to sell prematurely. Those who exit their positions now, he warned, may serve as “exit liquidity for the next financial reset.” A Message of Patience and Strategic Awareness “Don’t get shaken out,” he warned, concluding with a call for resilience. He clarified that his perspective does not require belief in conspiracy theories, but rather an understanding of incentives. Institutions are not broadcasting XRP’s utility on mainstream platforms, he explained. Instead, they are building its foundational role in boardrooms and private sectors. While public focus remains fixed on the Musk-Trump conflict, Pumpius claimed that the XRP Ledger is already processing millions of transactions per second. He described this period as historically significant. A time when retail attention is being diverted, while a suppressed asset like XRP begins to assume a central role in the new financial framework. The message from Pumpius is clear: XRP holders should remain focused and resist selling during what he perceives as a critical moment. His conclusion was resolute: “HODL. Don’t get shaken out. Don’t sell XRP.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-06-09T08:36:16,"These Altcoins Pop as Bitcoin Battles to Reclaim $106,000 (Market Watch)","Crypto prices remained relativey calm during the weekend, especially for the larger-cap coins, most of which retained their valuations or are trending slightly higher. Bitcoin tested $106,000 but the bulls failed to sustain the price above that level, which was followed by a slight retrace to around $105,500. Nonetheless, the week is packed with important economic events, so let’s dive into it. Bitcoin Bulls Battle for $106,000 At the time of this writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $105,500, charting a very slight increase of around 0.2% throughout the past 24 hours. Its weekly gains are also comparable. As seen in the chart below, the leading cryptocurrency was able to stage a full recovery from the drops that it witnessed during the clash between Donald Trump and Elon Musk earlier last week. Over the past couple of days, it even managed to hit $106,500, but the bulls were unable to sustain the pressure. Source: TradingView The market seems to be equalizing, which is evident from the declining amount of liquidations across derivatives positions. During the past 24 hours, around $125 million worth of both long and short positions were wiped off, which is relatively low, as opposed to periods of more serious volatility. That all might be about to change, though, because this week is packed with important economic events that might boost the market turmoil. CPI numbers are expected on Wednesday, which will reveal how the country is faring against inflation. Typically, this is associated with heightened short-term volatility. The PPI report is also slated for later in the week. The US and China will continue their trade talks starting today. Any development in this regard is surely to ignite a response as well. These Altcoins Outperform While the majority of the large-cap cryptocurrencies are trading flat for the most part today, some altcoins are charting more considerable gains. For example, Internet Computer (ICP) is up by 8.3%, while the popular meme coins Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) and SPX69000 (SPX) are up by almost 7% each. All in all, the market remains mostly in red but, as we mentioned, the declines are not serious.

2025-06-09T08:30:48,"Dogecoin Follows Bearish June Trend With over 4% Losses – Is The Worst Over?","The month of June has been historically bearish for the Dogecoin price , and so far, June 2025 is following the same trend. With just a little over a week into the month, the Dogecoin price has already seen a decline of over 4%, suggesting it is sticking to the established trend. If this is the case, then there is still a long way to go for the meme coin, as historical data suggests that there is more decline to come. 4% Losses May Not Be The End According to data from the CryptoRank website, the Dogecoin price is already down 4.57% in the month of June. But going by the performance of previous years leading up to 2025, this is still quite low compared to how much further the price could crash. For example, the Dogecoin price suffered a 21.9% decline in June 2024 and a 7.18% crash in June 2023. Going further back, there was a loss of 23.3% back in June 2022 and then a similar loss of 23.9% back in June 2021. The latter’s performance is even more important because the 23.9% decline happened in the height of the crypto bull market. Overall, the month of June has rarely ended well for the meme coin’s price, with only two green monthly closes in its over 11 years of existence. The average return for June is the lowest at -7.11% for the Dogecoin price, and the second lowest median return of -8.56%, second only to August’s median returns of -9.98%. Sticking to this average, a further decline could happen as the Dogecoin price moves closer to the average return for the month. A similar trend would see the price go toward the -7% territory before the month is over. Can The Dogecoin Price Defy The Odds? With Donald Trump’s tariff war against countries like China still in full swing, the crypto market is still feeling the effects as prices remain low. Altcoins like Dogecoin have suffered the brunt of the decline, and a continuation would push their prices further down. However, the machine learning algorithm on the Coincodex website has predicted a possible retracement upward that could push the Dogecoin price back toward the green this month. It suggests a recovery above $0.21 by the end of June, which would mean an over 10% increase in price from here. Open interest has also remained relatively stable this month, ranging above $1.9 billion, Coinglass shows . This means there is still sustained interest in trading the meme coin , with sentiment skewing toward bullish territory as the Bitcoin price remains above $100,000.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-follows-bearish-june/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Dogecoin|crypto|crypto news|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt",cryptocompare
2025-06-09T08:30:05,"XRP Bull Trap Incoming? Analyst Sees $2.40 Fakeout Before Painful Crash","Pseudonymous analyst CryptoInsightUK has warned that the next major move for XRP could be a trap. In a video published on June 8, the analyst outlined a scenario where XRP surges toward $2.30–$2.40 in the short term—only to reverse violently into a sharp liquidity flush before any sustainable breakout occurs. XRP Bull Trap Looming? “I think XRP goes to sub-$2.0. I really do,” he said, adding: “It could come and sweep the highs here… could come up to like what, $2.30, and then push us down. That would be more pain for everyone, ‘cause everyone’s going to think we’re going to the upside.” The setup he describes is based on market structure and liquidity dynamics, particularly the buildup of resting orders beneath XRP’s current range. “This here is a concern, a real concern for me,” he said, referring to the growing pool of liquidity below current prices. According to his internal models, such liquidity zones are statistically touched “80% of the time.” Related Reading: XRP Must Crash First—Then Comes The $10 Rally, Says Analyst “Someone’s trying to trick someone here,” he warned. “I’m cautious.” Despite his near-total XRP allocation—he states he’s “95%+, probably more like 98%” positioned in XRP—CryptoInsightUK emphasized that he’s not rooting for a correction. “I don’t want it to come down,” he said. “I’m just showing you what I see.” The analyst proposed multiple structural paths: one in which XRP immediately breaks out, and another where it briefly rallies to sweep local highs before flushing downward to form a bullish divergence. “We’re in a range right now,” he said. “Do we come up, sweep the highs, then take the lows and go?” He elaborated on the bullish divergence pattern he is watching, where price forms a lower low while the RSI (Relative Strength Index) prints a higher low—a setup he uses to identify bottoming structures. “That’s what I would like to see,” he explained. Broader Macro Conditions Still Supportive Despite the bearish tactical setup, the video struck an upbeat macro tone. Will cited four near-term catalysts: the Genius Act on stablecoin oversight, the imminent filing deadline in the SEC’s remedies phase against Ripple, the July decision window for a spot-XRP ETF proposal, and a renewed expectation of accommodative fiscal policy sparked by last week’s televised Trump-Musk dialogue. “What this really tells us is there’s going to be money printing,” he argued. “Assets all over are going to explode to the upside and, for the other specific reasons, XRP probably does even better.” Turning to Bitcoin, the analyst observed an ongoing decline in trading volume, suggesting indecision or exhaustion. “There’s been no volume. There’s been nothing,” he said of recent BTC price action. Related Reading: XRP Wave Structure Predicts Wild Fluctuations On Its Way To $4 ATH He highlighted a CME futures gap around $92,000–$93,000 and added that fixed range volume analysis points to a possible pullback zone at $96,000–$97,000. “It’s probably coming imminently, maybe this week,” he said of a potential correction, projecting a scenario where BTC dips into this range before resuming its upward trajectory. “Does this mean we squeeze to the upside or come down and take this low and put in that bullish divergence structure?” he asked, noting a similar divergence setup at $75,000 earlier this year. XRP Spot Activity Raises Red Flags In the final hour before the video, XRP had “squeezed up with some volume,” but the analyst urged caution. While open interest had risen sharply, funding remained green—suggesting net long positioning—and aggregate premium had turned red. “This indicates to me that even though there are still some shorts coming in, more longs than shorts have entered,” he said. He warned that this imbalance could cause a sharp move lower if the market fails to hold current levels. “If we do now come down and lose this low, expect a more aggressive, faster move to the downside,” he said, pointing to the risk of liquidating leveraged positions. XRP’s relative performance against ETH and BTC also came under review. While it had begun testing resistance zones, neither the XRP/ETH nor the XRP/BTC charts had decisively broken out. “We could still be in this range chopping about,” he cautioned. “Could lose strength until we start to see some confirmations to the upside.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.23.

2025-06-09T08:15:10,"Nasdaq files SEC Form 8-K to expand crypto ETF benchmark","Nasdaq has filed a Form 8-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposing a change to the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF (NCIQ) benchmark. The filing, submitted on June 2, shows Nasdaq is planning to expand the index from five to nine cryptocurrencies by adding XRP, Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Stellar Lumens (XLM). The proposal could change the ETF from its current benchmark, the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index (NCIUS), to the broader Nasdaq Crypto Index (NCI). The SEC is expected to decide on this proposal by November 2, 2025. Nasdaq engages the SEC to expand the Hashdex Crypto Index Due to regulatory constraints, the Hashdex ETF holds only Bitcoin and Ethereum, even though the index it tracks, before the Form 8-K filing, included six cryptos. Hashdex is using a sampling mechanism to mitigate tracking errors, but the index’s market alignment is currently unattainable until regulatory clarity is achieved. Pending approval, the Nasdaq Crypto Index (NCI) now includes nine digital assets: Bitcoin , Ethereum, XRP, Solana, Cardano, Stellar Lumens, Chainlink, Litecoin, and Uniswap. Against the backdrop of Nasdaq’s SEC filing, XRP saw modest gains, moving above $2.23 during Monday’s early trading sessions, and is 3.1% up from its weekly lows. Solana pushed its price to near $155 after plummeting closer to the $140 mark last Friday. The token saw a gain of 0.2% intraday, and a 36% trading volume increase within the same period. Cardano continued its trend of weekly losses, now changing hands at the $0.67 range, while Stellar Lumens also recorded losses of over 1% in the week of Nasdaq’s announcement. Leadership changes at Hashdex Sponsor The Nasdaq filing also included news about two leadership changes at Hashdex Asset Management Ltd., the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF sponsor. On June 2, 2025, Bruno Leonardo Kmita de Oliveira Passos resigned from the sponsor’s Board of Directors position. His departure also ended his tenure as the Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer of the Trust. According to regulatory disclosures, Mr. Passos’s resignation was not linked to any disagreement with the Trust or the Sponsor on matters related to operations, policies, or practices. Effective the same day, Samir Elias Hachem Kerbage was appointed to replace Mr. Passos on the Board of Directors and in his executive roles. Kerbage currently serves as Chief Investment Officer at Hashdex and has led the firm’s investment strategy since 2018. Industry calls for change in SEC ETF Approval Process In other related news, leading asset managers are asking the SEC to change current ETF approval strategy. On June 6, VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital co-signed a letter to the SEC calling for the agency to reinstate the “first-to-file, first-to-approve” policy for exchange-traded products (ETPs). SEC favoritism undermines innovation in the ETF market. pic.twitter.com/HM7P2Dm0XP — VanEck (@vaneck_us) June 6, 2025 The letter, published on VanEck’s official X account, lambasted the SEC for approving multiple crypto ETFs simultaneously, regardless of submission dates. The fund managers argue that this approach disadvantages early filers, and disproportionately benefits larger firms with more resources. “ When the Commission plays favourites, it costs ETP sponsors money and makes the ETP marketplace less fair ,” the letter read, referencing the 2021 approval of ProShares’ Bitcoin futures ETF. The product’s early approval gave it a dominant 90% market share within days of launch. The joint letter also mentioned the SEC’s January 10, 2024, approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs on the same day. Ethereum ETFs also received the “go-ahead” in a similar fashion months later. VanEck and 21Shares, among the earliest to file for Bitcoin and Ethereum spot products, were grouped with later applicants during final approvals.

And Which Coin Will Rise From It? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News When Two Titans Collide, the Market Feels Every Shock Elon Musk and Donald Trump’s clash on X didn’t just light up headlines , it shook the financial world. Tesla stock nosedived, crypto took a hit, and within hours, Bitcoin dropped below $101,000 while Ethereum slipped over 6 percent. The fallout wiped out $170 billion from the market. It wasn’t just price drops. Over $950 million in long positions vanished as liquidations swept across exchanges. Trump mocked Musk’s leadership at Tesla, Musk clapped back, and traders scrambled. Was this genuine tension , or a carefully timed shakeup? The debate is on. Some see it as a market reset, designed to scare off weak hands. Others feel it’s just chaos as usual. But for those paying close attention, moments like this are where new opportunities begin. Crypto Markets Shudder as Two Power Players Go Head-to-Head Volatility Spikes, But a Few Investors Spot the Pattern The Musk-Trump fallout didn’t just stay on social media. It triggered a wave of panic in markets, especially crypto. While most ran for cover, a handful of investors stayed calm , and looked deeper. They saw beyond the red charts. Some believe this is more than a feud , it could be an intentional move to reset sentiment and prepare for bigger plays ahead. Whatever the truth, it sparked a wave of exits , and quietly, a wave of entries. Because while most were watching the drama, some were watching a new name rise. In the Shadows of a Sell-Off, One Meme Coin Begins to Rise Investors Are Asking: What’s This Frog-Based Token That’s Gaining Attention?

2025-06-09T08:08:38,"Here’s How Bitcoin’s Price Gets to $1 Million (Adam Back)","Once, the idea of the price of Bitcoin (BTC) hitting $1 million sounded like moon-talk, but this notion seems to be changing from fringe speculation into a mainstream investment thesis, championed by some of crypto’s most influential figures. Fueled by growing institutional adoption and bold long-term forecasts, the pathway to this price target hinges on a seemingly simple, yet monumental, shift: Wall Street allocating a significant slice of its vast wealth to the number one digital asset. Wall Street is the Game-Changer At the recent Bitcoin 2025 event, Strategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor emphatically stated: “When Wall Street is 10% Bitcoin, Bitcoin will be $1,000,000 a coin.” According to him, this level of allocation would equate to as much as $20 trillion flowing into BTC markets, making a hostile takeover economically impossible as aggressive buying would only empower existing holders. The Bitcoin maxi isn’t alone in his mega-bullish outlook. Blockstream CEO Adam Back believes BTC could achieve the $1 million target way before Wall Street accumulates 10% of the cryptocurrency. He suggested that even a widespread 2% allocation across major asset managers like BlackRock would be enough to push Bitcoin’s price to that level. It is not the first time Saylor has predicted BTC’s price hitting seven figures. In a September 2024 interview with CNBC, he forecasted a long-term price for the king cryptocurrency of $13 million, calling it “perfect money” in contrast to fiat currencies, which he labeled “pseudoscience.” Other prominent voices such as former Binance chief Changpeng Zhao, popularly known as CZ, have echoed similar sentiment. The crypto entrepreneur previously projected BTC could end up anywhere between $500,000 and $2 million in this cycle. Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest is another entity sharing the optimism. In April, the firm revised its base case target for BTC to $1.2 million by 2030, with a bullish estimate of $2.4 million. ARK attributed the potential surge to institutional adoption, especially via spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as well as Bitcoin’s growing role as a decentralized, programmable store of value. In the company’s estimation, all bets would be off if BTC manages to capture at least 6.5% of the projected $200 trillion global investable assets market. This would dwarf gold’s current share at roughly 3.6%, a comparison backed by data that Bitcoin enthusiast and early stage angel investor Fred Krueger recently shared , showing that more Americans now own Bitcoin (49.6 million) than gold (36.7 million), with significantly higher average holdings. Price Performance Meanwhile, BTC’s price action reflects a market digesting its recent surge to a new all-time high of $111,814. At the time of this writing, the asset was trading at $105,466, after oscillating between $105,112 and $106,365 in the last 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, it gained a modest 0.6% to outperform the broader crypto market, which dipped 0.8% in that period. Zooming out some more, BTC’s current price is a 2.1% improvement over the last month, while on a yearly basis, it has soared 52.2%, highlighting a long-term uptrend with brief pullbacks.

That would make Tether the 19th largest company in the world, ahead of giants Costco and Coca-Cola. Ardoino acknowledged that the figure was impressive, but said the estimate was “a bit cautious” given Tether’s growing Bitcoin and gold reserves. Tether’s IPO valuation is driven by the current market cap of Circle, one of its largest competitors in the industry, at $30 billion. According to internal financial models, Circle will reach $410 billion in EBITDA in 2025, which is priced at a 69.3 multiple. Related News: Whale Activity Indicator at Its Peak in On-Chain Data - Here Are the Altcoins They Are Trading Tether, which announced a net profit of $13 billion for 2024, is reported to have earned $7 billion of this profit from Treasury bonds and repo transactions. The remaining $5 billion in profit consists of unrealized gains on Bitcoin and gold assets; these gains are not included in EBITDA calculations. Over the next year, Tether is expected to increase its USDT supply by another $50 billion to $60 billion, and will operate with an average USDT supply of $170 billion. With an average Fed interest rate of 4.2%, this would translate into EBITDA of around $7.4 billion in 2025.

The company thanked its users for helping shape the ecosystem and said it remains focused on aligning incentives between the project and its community. Token burns are designed to reduce supply, potentially increasing scarcity and price over time. In this case, market response was swift. AVL surged over 18% shortly after the announcement and ranked #1 in futures buys on Bybit. Avalon Labs is a financial technology company that is building Bitcoin-backed on-chain capital markets. The platform has already disbursed more than $1.2 billion in overcollateralized BTC-backed loans. To extend this model to institutional clients, it recently obtained a $2 billion credit line from prominent Asian conglomerates.

Users can deposit FBTC, a 1:1 Bitcoin-pegged asset, and borrow Tether ( USDT ) at fixed rates, funds that are deployed into high-yield strategies via platforms like Ethena Labs ( ENA ). Avalon operates across 20+ public blockchains and 50+ isolated lending markets, with total value locked exceeding $1.1 billion, as per DefiLlama data . The burn follows several major developments for Avalon Labs. On May 26, YZi Labs, formerly Binance Labs, announced an undisclosed investment in Avalon, boosting the project’s institutional backing.

2025-06-09T07:43:17,"Nasdaq Adds XRP to Settlement Price Index — How Will XRP Price React?","Key Takeaways: XRP has been added to the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index. Current SEC restrictions prevent Hashdex’s ETF from holding XRP, though a rule change decision is pending. XRP price faces short-term bearish pressure, with key resistance at $2.30 and downside risk toward $2.14. XRP has joined the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, a move that could further open the door to institutional exposure and reshape liquidity across key markets. On June 6, asset manager Hashdex updated its Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), outlining changes to its benchmark. According to the filing, Nasdaq expanded the index on June 2 to include XRP, alongside Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Stellar Lumens (XLM). Previously, the index was limited to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Hashdex’s NCIQ ETF Tracks This Index Hashdex’s ETF, which trades under the ticker NCIQ, tracks this index, providing market-cap weighted exposure to BTC and ETH within a regulated framework. However, current SEC restrictions prevent the ETF from holding any digital assets beyond BTC and ETH, a limitation that may introduce tracking risk now that XRP and others are included in the benchmark. “Under current regulatory restrictions, the Trust is only permitted to hold bitcoin and ether, and is not permitted to hold the new index constituents,” the filing states. “As such, the risk of potential tracking error is increased.” Separately, Nasdaq submitted a proposed rule change in March that would allow the ETF to track the broader Nasdaq Crypto Index (NCI), which already includes XRP, SOL, ADA, XLM, Chainlink (LINK), Litecoin (LTC), and Uniswap (UNI). XRP was officially added to the NCI on June 3, 2024. Should the SEC approve Nasdaq’s rule change, Hashdex’s ETF would be able to hold all NCI constituents — a potential game-changer for XRP’s institutional footprint. A final SEC decision is expected by November 2. Bears Pressure XRP Despite Nasdaq Index Inclusion XRP is trading near $2.22 after a volatile weekend, with technical signals pointing toward bearish momentum in the short term. On the 2-hour chart, XRP faced strong resistance around $2.30 and failed to sustain upward momentum, retreating to the lower Bollinger Band at $2.14. RSI stands at 51.52, indicating neutral momentum but leaning toward overbought after recent rallies. The MACD remains flat, signaling indecision among traders. On the 30-minute chart, XRP shows a sharper downward trend. RSI is at 34.32, approaching oversold territory, while the MACD remains negative, reinforcing near-term bearish pressure. The price has struggled to stay above the $2.25 support, suggesting sellers remain in control. The 1-minute chart confirms short-term weakness, with RSI falling to 32.74 and MACD in negative territory. Buyers are failing to generate sustained volume, with recent bounces quickly sold off. Despite XRP’s inclusion in the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, institutional flows have yet to lift price action meaningfully. Unless XRP reclaims $2.30 with strong volume, further downside toward $2.14 remains likely. Traders should monitor broader market sentiment and upcoming SEC decisions that could affect institutional access to XRP-based products.

2025-06-09T07:21:31,"Cathie Wood: Bitcoin’s value will multiply 15x in the next five years","Founder and CEO of ARK Investment Management, Cathie Wood believes Bitcoin’s value will reach at least $1.5 million by the time 2030 rolls around, growing by 15x from its current price. In a recent interview on the YouTube channel The Diary of a CEO, Wood breaks down the main reasons why she believes BTC ( BTC )’s value is bound to skyrocket to at least $1.5 million within the next few years. The ARK Investment CEO mentioned several core pillars which make up the “building blocks” of BTC’s growth in the market. One of the major drivers is institutional investments from corporate holders such as Arkham, Strategy and Metaplanet. “Bitcoin is more of an investment because it does appreciate overtime. Now you go through [it], it’s volatile. No question. And that’s the first thing people have to know about it. But it is becoming less volatile as more and more investors hold it,” she said in the interview. According to Wood, a lot of institutional investors have just started to gravitating towards BTC. Therefore, she believes the crypto space will see a flurry of demand from institutional holders who see the appeal of Bitcoin as a new asset class that offers diversification for business portfolios. Wood remarked that the world has not had a new asset class since the 1600s with the introduction of equities. Since then, the global market’s has been occupied by the same traditional assets including stocks , bonds, commodities and real estate . However now, there is a recent shift towards Bitcoin as a desirable asset. “If this asset does not perform like other assets, in other words, it provides diversification for funds. And because it is behaving differently, institutions have to consider it,” said Wood. Price chart for Bitcoin in the past few hours of trading, June 9, 2025 | Source: crypto.news You might also like: Cathie Wood predicts Bitcoin’s $2t market cap will soon flip gold after hitting $100k milestone Wood believes the institutional players currently rushing to adopt Bitcoin are late, considering there is only 1 million BTC left to be minted by miners, which represents only around $100 billion worth of untapped capital. “So they’re [institutions] just now committing and there’s only $100 billion of new market cap that is going to be created. Whereas they have trillions of dollars under management,” said Wood. “And so we think there will be a lot of incremental demand, and to satisfy a lot of that demand. Someone’s going to have to sell,” she continued. Institutional appetite for Bitcoin Wood’s statement indicates a wider trend among institutional investors which are just now discovering the advantages of holding Bitcoin. Back in May, Matrixport analysts found that unlike previous bull markets, the rally that raised BTC to a new all-time high of $111,814 was mostly driven by institutional demand, instead of the retail investors. This means that more institutional investors such as major companies and financial management firms are crowding the market now more than ever before. In fact, at least 61 corporate treasuries currently hold a combined 3.2% of the total BTC supply according to Standard Chartered’s Bitcoin report. Most recently, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet announced its plans to acquire 210,000 BTC by 2027, aiming to own 1% of the total supply of global BTC. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s Strategy remains the largest corporate holder of BTC, possessing 580,955 BTC as of June 9, holding around 2.7% of the total Bitcoin supply.

This acquisition brought the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 1,437, now valued at more than $150m. It also marked one of the largest Bitcoin treasury allocations by a publicly traded firm in Europe. The move follows a shareholder resolution passed in February. That resolution approved capital raises targeting strategic investors in areas like Web3 and AI. Now, a second resolution under review could raise the limit from $40.4m to $538.5m. If passed, it would give the board greater flexibility to extend the program. Amid rising inflation and broader economic uncertainty, firms are rethinking traditional treasury models.

2025-06-09T07:15:46,"Michael Saylor dismissed claims on the threat posed by quantum computers to virtual currencies","Michael Saylor, executive chairman of Strategy, has expressed his views on the potential threat quantum computing poses to cryptocurrencies. He described the concerns as partly a marketing tactic by those promoting new quantum concept tokens. Saylor believes that major firms like Google and Microsoft would not support the development of quantum computers that could break modern encryption. He argued that such developments could undermine the security of their systems and operations. Saylor expects Bitcoin to counter quantum threat with software upgrades NEW‼️- ARE YOU WORRIED QUANTUM COMPUTING WILL BREAK BITCOIN? 💥 MICHAEL SAYLOR: pic.twitter.com/CVeFWXML4H — Neil Jacobs (@NeilJacobs) June 6, 2025 BlackRock considers Quantum computers, with their ability to outperform classical binary computers and break traditional encryption, a threat to crypto. Michael Saylor dismissed Quantum’s threat to Bitcoin, saying that the BTC protocol would implement a software upgrade when the threat becomes imminent. Saylor responded to concerns about the threat of computers soon being able to break the encryption that enables the scarcity of Bitcoin. He also believes that major tech companies can’t sell to customers a computer that can breach BTC’s cryptography because it would destroy them and the entire banking industry. “It’s mainly marketing from people that want to sell you the next quantum yo-yo token. Google and Microsoft aren’t going to sell you a computer that cracks modern cryptography because it would destroy Google and Microsoft – and the U.S. Government and the banking system.” -Michael Saylor, CEO at Strategy. The quantum sector has had several proposals about how to secure Proof of Work against the quantum threat, including from BTQ Technologies, a startup building quantum-proof crypto hardware. One BTC developer has also introduced a draft Bitcoin Improvement Protocol that proposes a hard fork to move everyone’s wallets to quantum-secure addresses. Saylor argued that the bigger security threat for Bitcoin is phishing, noting that the digital asset is a protocol that gets upgraded yearly. Presto Research also acknowledged in a recent report that the crypto industry is unprepared for the coming quantum threat. Google also suggested in new research that RSA encryption, a critical security feature used in securing Bitcoin, may be more susceptible to quantum computing attacks than previously anticipated. The Quantum AI researcher Craig Gidney, published a new report indicating that RSA encryption could be broken with 20 times fewer quantum resources than previously estimated. He noted that a quantum computer could theoretically break the 2048-bit RSA encryption with 1 million qubits running for one week. Gidney did not mention digital assets, although the Elliptic Curve Cryptographic algorithm, which secures transactions on BTC with public and private keys, is similar in principle to the RSA. A previous study also suggested that despite Elliptic Curve Cryptography being secure against classical computers, a strong enough quantum computer could effectively crack it in the years to come. Google’s latest next-generation quantum chip, Willow, has also ignited concerns over Bitcoin’s cryptography. The firm said the chip could solve a standard benchmark computation in under five minutes, a task that would take the world’s fastest supercomputers 10 septillions years to solve. Hunter wants the BTC community to focus on preparedness rather than denial A study led by the University of Kent’s School of Computing suggested that BTC might need to undergo a costly and time-consuming update process to counter the threat of quantum computing in the future. CTO and co-founder of self-custody service Casa, Jameson Lopp, also argued that Bitcoin’s community has less than a decade to implement contingency plans. According to a study published by Deloitte, 25% of BTC’s circulating supply is vulnerable to quantum attacks because their associated wallets’ keys have been exposed. The firm also found that the sum totaling 4 million Bitcoin at the time is worth nearly $42 billion, based on current prices. Anduro Senior Protocol Engineer Hunter Beast and Marathon Director of Engineering Michael B. Casey suggested that Bitcoin’s algorithms could be cracked with zero warning. The experts also argued that attackers would get far less in the case of a breach. They believe that if BTC’s algorithms are cracked, it could immediately depress the asset’s price during a liquidation event. Beast and Casey acknowledged that Bitcoin can be secured against quantum threats by moving funds to a wallet that hasn’t had its public key exposed yet. They also noted it could be impossible for actors that have lost their keys or impractical for exchanges that let the public make on-chain deposits. Beast emphasized that the community should lean towards preparedness instead of denial. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

2025-06-09T07:04:25,"Analyst Says Bitcoin Has ‘Pretty Good’ Chance of Hitting Massive Price Target in 2026, Citing Three Technical Signals","An analyst known for making timely Bitcoin calls believes that BTC will surge to an astronomical price level next year based on three technical signals. In a new strategy session, pseudonymous analyst Cheds tells his 49,700 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin looks strong on the weekly chart after breaking out from a cup-and-handle pattern. In technical analysis, a cup-and-handle pattern is a bullish continuation structure indicating that an asset is primed to move higher after a period of consolidation. The second bullish signal, according to Cheds, is that the uptrend appears technically sound based on how much time Bitcoin spent forming a solid base between $16,000 and $70,000. And third, the trader says the depth of the consolidation range in the last three years is likely enough to sustain rallies above $200,000 in 2026. “It’s still my base case, and this is just a very general outline. I think we have a pretty good chance of mid-$250,000 in 2026. That seems kind of aggressive, I know. But the funny thing is that this has been a conservative target for some people because people are talking about [hitting $250,000] this year. Absolutely not. That’s crazy… There is zero chance of $250,000 this year, but I think it’s a decent chance of mid-$250,000 just based on the height of the cup-and-handle [pattern], and the time interval and the consolidation range… That’s still my general idea, just based on the weekly trajectory.” Source: Cheds/YouTube At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $105,706.

2025-06-09T07:00:49,"Bitcoin Price Risks Crash To $31,000 Amid 5-Wave Impulse Completion","Over the last few weeks, the Bitcoin price has been on an upward trajectory, propelled forward mainly by institutional adoption and buying. This has seen the Bitcoin price rally to new all-time highs at $111,900, and has remained above $100,000 despite a turn in market sentiment toward the negative. However, this support has not bolstered confidence, with one analyst predicting that the leading cryptocurrency has seen the end of this bull cycle. Bitcoin Price Completes Elliot Wave Theory The Elliot Wave Theory is a chart pattern that has been widely used as Bitcoin has become more mainstream in an effort to predict where the price may be headed next. The theory consists of five full waves, at the end of which lies a bearish trend for the digital asset. So far, the Bitcoin price has been moving through different waves according to different analysts. But Sniper Academy on the TradingView platform has revealed that the five waves have been completed. Related Reading: Ethereum Head & Shoulders Pattern Breakdown: Can Bulls Reclaim Control? Using the 1-month Bitcoin price chart, the crypto analyst shows that there have been five different waves completed. The latest all-time high peak above $111,900 is shown to have been the fifth and final wave, suggesting that this bullish impulse is complete. Given that the Bitcoin price has now completed this theory, the crypto analyst explains that this means that the cryptocurrency has now hit the upper boundary of a long-term ascending channel. Simply put, this is very bearish for the digital asset as this means an end to its upward trajectory. Right now, the analyst showed that the Bitcoin price is already forming divergence after the completion of the fifth wave. This has triggered a weakness in the momentum and has come as a result of resistance forming between $76,000 and $111,000. This trend shows that a potential double top has been created, and that means that there is nowhere for the Bitcoin price to go now but down. BTC Price Targets $31,000 Bottom Given the fact that the crypto analyst believes that the Elliot Wave Theory has played out and the five waves have been completed, the next expectation is a sharp drop in the Bitcoin price. The first move is expected toward $66,000, which would be an almost 50% decline in price from here. Related Reading: Dogecoin’s Growth Pattern Hints At Massive June–July Rally After 5-Month Pullback However, this is not the worst of it, as the crypto analyst sees the cryptocurrency still breaking down to $53,000. Then, if this level does fail to hold, then a fall all the way down to as low as $31,000, serving as the bottom of the channel. This also coincides with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. Once the Bitcoin price is back at $31,000, the crypto analyst believes that accumulation would begin at this key zone. This will then serve as the important level that will drive the start of the next major bull cycle.

This data suggests a capital rotation into Ethereum as its network usage hits a 1-year high. Analysts predict ETH could rally to $4,000 if it breaks the key $2,700 resistance. Binance’s latest Proof of Reserves (PoR) report reveals a subtle but significant shift in trader strategy, suggesting a capital rotation out of Bitcoin and into Ethereum. The June 1, 2025, report shows user Bitcoin holdings fell by 1.82% to 593,000 BTC, while Ethereum balances climbed 1.05% to 5.34 million ETH. While the changes are modest, the dip in both Bitcoin and USDT holdings, which fell by $223 million, points to a clear trend: traders may be moving capital into ETH to capitalize on its growing momentum and bullish market sentiment. This on-chain data from the world’s largest exchange provides a new layer of evidence for an increasingly popular market thesis.

2025-06-09T06:52:07,"What’s the Latest on the Potential Altcoin Season? An Experienced Analyst Shares His Insights","Cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe made remarkable statements regarding the question “when is the altcoin season?” which is frequently asked by investors. Van de Poppe said that the current cycle is quite different from previous years and that investor psychology is one of the most important determinants of this process. According to Van de Poppe, the term altcoin season has a much deeper meaning than it seems on the surface. “If you enter the market as an investor during the altcoin season, you are probably missing out on the biggest profit opportunities,” the analyst said, arguing that the real profits are made by those who take positions at the lowest levels of the market. Van de Poppe reminded that there was a memecoin craze throughout 2024, but many altcoins lost value. The analyst said that the first quarter of 2025 was also quite weak for altcoins, and that this process exhausted the patience of investors. Related News: Experienced Analyst Reveals 4 Essential Conditions for the Mega Altcoin Season Van de Poppe stated that there are two main views in the current market, one group arguing that we are still in a bear market, while the other group believes that we are at the beginning of a bull market. He stated that this separation has led many investors to take the wrong position. According to the analyst, the current weak performance of altcoins against Bitcoin, central banks signaling changes in their monetary policies, and fundamental advances in areas such as DeFi may be harbingers of a transformation. The absence of altcoin season signals is thought-provoking, according to Van de Poppe. “The market bottom is usually the point where people are most insecure. But that’s when the biggest gains are made in the long run,” said the analyst, arguing that investors who see this period as an opportunity should be patient. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-09T06:34:07,"Gold Price Decline Could Trigger Crypto Surge, Says Analyst Michael van de Poppe","The post Gold Price Decline Could Trigger Crypto Surge, Says Analyst Michael van de Poppe appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Top crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe has identified the gold market as the key chart to watch this week. He warns that gold’s short-term downtrend could trigger a major shift in investor sentiment, potentially redirecting liquidity away from traditional “risk-off” assets like gold and into “risk-on” assets such as cryptocurrencies. Gold’s Sudden Decline Indicates Potential Downtrend According to the daily gold spot chart, gold experienced a strong performance at the beginning of last week. On Monday, June 2, the price closed at $3,381.50, gaining 2.37% in a single day. However, starting Tuesday, June 3, the market began showing signs of weakness. By the close of Friday, June 6, gold had fallen to $3,309.998, marking a 2.21% drop from Monday’s close. Notably, in just the last two days of the week, the gold price slipped by 1.92%, intensifying concerns of a short-term bearish trend. Van de Poppe highlighted this movement in a recent post, suggesting that the late-week drop may confirm the beginning of a broader short-term downtrend. Investors May Shift from Gold to Crypto The analyst points out that continued weakness in gold could lead investors to reallocate capital toward risk-on assets. In today’s market landscape, crypto is increasingly becoming the preferred choice for such investments. A decline in gold prices often reflects reduced demand for safe-haven assets, prompting investors to seek higher returns in more volatile sectors like digital assets. Possible Catalyst Behind Gold’s Downtrend While the exact reason for gold’s recent decline remains unclear, analysts, including van de Poppe, suspect it may be linked to speculation around leadership changes at the U.S. Federal Reserve . Reports suggest that the White House, under President Donald Trump, may be considering replacing Fed Chair Jerome Powell with former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh. If true, this development could have wide-ranging effects on market sentiment and monetary policy, indirectly influencing gold prices. Gold Price Forecast: Critical Levels to Watch Van de Poppe predicts that if gold fails to reclaim the $3,365 level in the short term, the market could face a further decline of 4% to 10% over the next few weeks. Conversely, a strong rebound above this level could open the door to new all-time highs for the yellow metal. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : US-China Trade Talks Begin Today — Will Bitcoin and Ethereum React? , Crypto Market Shows Signs of Strength While the broader cryptocurrency market saw a 4% decline earlier in the week, it staged a recovery by week’s end. On Friday, the market posted a 2.49% gain. Over the weekend, the total crypto market cap increased from $3.21 trillion to $3.26 trillion, reflecting a 1.59% rise. This suggests that some investors may already be reallocating funds from gold into cryptocurrencies in response to market shifts. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Gold and Crypto As uncertainty looms over the Federal Reserve’s leadership and macroeconomic conditions remain volatile, both gold and crypto markets are at a turning point. Should gold continue its downtrend, cryptocurrencies could benefit from increased inflows. Investors and analysts alike will be closely monitoring price action this week to assess whether this rotation gains further momentum. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

A sustained downtrend in gold could signal reduced demand for safe-haven assets, potentially redirecting significant liquidity into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. How is gold’s performance connected to the crypto market? As gold weakens, investors may move capital from gold (risk-off) to crypto (risk-on) seeking higher returns, creating an inverse relationship between the two. Is it better to invest in gold or Bitcoin right now? With gold weakening, many investors see Bitcoin as a stronger short-term growth opportunity in 2025.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/gold-price-decline-could-trigger-crypto-surge-says-analyst-michael-van-de-poppe/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Gold Price",cryptocompare

2025-06-09T06:29:55,"CEX Spot Volumes Drop to 2020 Lows as Market Shifts into HODL Mode: CryptoQuant Analyst","Spot trading activity on centralized exchanges (CEX) has dropped to levels last seen in Oct. 2020, according to data shared by CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr on Monday. The sharp decline reflects a broader market shift, with fewer coins being sold or moved on-chain as crypto investors choose to hold their assets rather than actively trade. Musk and Trump Stir Market Turbulence The slowdown in activity follows a volatile week marked by macroeconomic uncertainty and high-profile social media moments. Bitcoin remained largely range-bound until midweek, when volatility spiked following a fallout between Elon Musk and Donald Trump that caught the market’s attention . The average spot trading volume on CEXs has dropped to October 2020 levels. Coins are not being sold on spot or moved on-chain – the market has shifted into HODL mode. pic.twitter.com/9bl1PejBVD — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) June 9, 2025 The public clash between Donald Trump and Elon Musk injected a fresh wave of uncertainty into the crypto market. Both figures hold outsized influence over investor sentiment, particularly within tech and digital asset circles. Their dispute unsettled markets, contributing to volatility across asset classes. Tesla shares saw a historic drop, while traders braced for potential shifts in policy direction and regulatory tone. Sentiment was further shaken ahead of the release of the US Non-Farm Payrolls report . While BTC briefly dropped by 5%, it quickly recovered on the back of stronger-than-expected labor market data. Traders Pull Back as Risk Aversion Grows and Sell-Side Imbalance Builds Despite the rebound, market signals remain cautious. According to Hyblock Capital, orderbook data shows a growing bearish skew. The bid-ask ratio has turned negative across spot, perpetual futures, and combined exchange platforms, meaning more sellers are placing limit orders near the current price than buyers. Historically, this pattern has preceded local tops and short-term declines in Bitcoin’s price. A key factor behind the drop in CEX volumes is investor risk aversion. Following years of turbulence, from the collapse of FTX in 2022 to regulatory crackdowns on Binance and Coinbase in 2023, traders have become more cautious. Many have chosen to move assets off exchanges and into long-term storage. With DEX Adoption Rising, CEX Face Ongoing Outflows Adding to the shift is the rise of decentralized exchanges. In May 2025, DEXs claimed a record 25% share of global spot trading volume, up from 20% earlier in the year. The jump reflects both improved wallet usability and growing dissatisfaction with centralized platforms. Permissionless access and composable trading environments have made DEXs increasingly attractive to more experienced users. Analysts say this “HODL mode” is unlikely to reverse without a material change in sentiment or stronger market catalysts. Liquidity clusters are now forming around the $107,000 level, while a key support zone remains below, potentially acting as a magnet for price if bearish pressure builds. For now, low activity and rising caution define the landscape. With volatility simmering just beneath the surface, traders appear more inclined to watch from the sidelines than to chase short-term gains.

2025-06-09T06:14:06,"Global Crime Wave Forces Bitcoin Family to Go Underground","Despite the growing global concerns about kidnappings and assaults linked to digital assets, major players like Strategy continue to aggressively accumulate Bitcoin. In fact, Michael Saylor hinted at another purchase after a recent $1 billion stock offering. Meanwhile, the crypto community is pressuring Elon Musk to fully embrace Bitcoin as tensions grow between him and Donald Trump. Bitcoin Family Overhauls Security Didi Taihuttu, the patriarch of the well-known “Bitcoin Family,” implemented a sweeping overhaul of his digital asset security measures in response to the growing wave of violent crimes targeting cryptocurrency holders. The Taihuttu family famously committed to an all-Bitcoin lifestyle in 2017, and took drastic steps to safeguard their crypto assets by spreading their private key information across four continents. In a recent interview with CNBC, Taihuttu revealed that the family no longer relies solely on hardware wallets. Instead, they now employ a hybrid security model that includes blockchain-based storage systems and physically distributed components of their seed phrases. Bitcoin Family According to Taihuttu, their seed phrase has been encrypted, divided into four parts, and stored using a combination of fireproof metal plates and blockchain solutions. These plates are hidden in undisclosed physical locations worldwide. To strengthen the setup even more, Taihuttu altered some of the words in the seed phrase. This means that even if someone were to obtain part of it, they wouldn’t be able to access the assets without knowing the correct contextual modifications. He also pointed out that even under coercion, he could not give away more than what is immediately accessible on his phone or wallet, which contains only a small portion of their holdings. (Source: CNBC ) The shift in strategy happened due to a surge in crypto-linked crimes. Over the past few months, there has been a disturbing increase in kidnappings, extortion, and violent assaults on crypto users around the world. Taihuttu and his family chose to stop posting real-time updates of their travels due to safety concerns, as threats from individuals who tracked their movements online became too serious to ignore. Although the family continues to live a global, nomadic lifestyle, they now take better precautions to shield their movements and protect their digital wealth. Under their new model, about 65% of the family’s crypto assets are secured in cold storage, while their hot wallets, which are used for trading and daily expenses, are guarded using multisignature protocols. Between late 2024 and early 2025, several high-profile cases made headlines across the globe, including a January conviction of gang members in the UK for kidnapping and torturing a crypto investor. There was also a February case in Chicago where six men abducted a family and demanded $15 million in digital assets. In March, popular streamer Kaitlyn Siragusa, who is known online as “Amouranth,” endured a terrifying home invasion where armed intruders demanded crypto transfers. One of the most alarming incidents occurred on May 13 in Paris, when three masked men tried to kidnap the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium. Noizat’s daughter bravely resisted the attackers, and even managed to disarm one of them before bystanders intervened. Strategy Signals New Bitcoin Buy Despite this very concerning rise in crypto-targeted crimes, people and companies are still accumulating Bitcoin. Michael Saylor, the co-founder and executive chairman of Strategy, caused speculation of another major Bitcoin purchase after posting a cryptic message, “Send more Orange,” on X on June 8. Saylor is known for teasing Bitcoin acquisitions through posts like these, and if history repeats, Strategy could soon announce another buy. The timing follows Strategy’s recent acquisition of 705 BTC between May 26 and June 1 for approximately $75 million at an average price of $106,495 per coin. This brought the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 580,955 BTC, which is valued at roughly $61.4 billion. According to SaylorTracker , the firm is currently sitting on an unrealized profit of about $20.6 billion. This is a 50% gain on its Bitcoin investment. Strategy’s aggressive accumulation continues to be fueled by capital raises, with the latest being a $1 billion stock offering . This greatly expands on its initial $250 million raise and is aimed at financing even more Bitcoin purchases as well as general corporate needs. The new offering includes 11.76 million shares of its 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock, priced at $85 each. After expenses, the company expects to net approximately $979 million. The preferred shares feature non-cumulative 10% dividends, appealing to institutional investors seeking yield while giving Strategy predictable financing to deepen its Bitcoin exposure. The company’s bold approach makes it the largest known Bitcoin holder in the world, surpassing even the combined Bitcoin reserves of the United States and China. Strategy’s holdings are nearly 12 times bigger than those of the second-largest public Bitcoin holder, mining firm Mara Holdings. As a result, many investors now see Strategy as a de facto Bitcoin ETF alternative that offers direct exposure to the asset through corporate equity. Elon Musk Pressured to Go All In on Bitcoin Members of the Bitcoin community are also urging Tesla CEO Elon Musk to go all in on Bitcoin as tensions escalate between Musk and US President Donald Trump. The public feud became a lightning rod for crypto advocates, who see it as an opportunity for Musk to strike back by embracing Bitcoin more aggressively. Crypto analyst Will Clemente posted on X that “the best way for Elon to get back at Trump is by full porting Bitcoin.” JAN3 CEO Samson Mow directly called on Musk to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy and resume accepting BTC for Tesla purchases. Mow also suggested that Musk’s space venture, SpaceX, offer launch discounts to customers who pay in Bitcoin. He said that it’s time to “force a hard money standard on the money printers.” This follows his criticism of Trump for failing to follow through after signing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve executive order. He also pointed out that the US has yet to acquire more Bitcoin and risks falling behind other nations. Mow even warned Musk to act before facing potential financial restrictions, and suggested that “at least do it before they freeze your fiat assets.” Others in the crypto space speculated that if Musk truly committed to Bitcoin, it would be on a massive scale. Boyd Cohen , CEO of Lomob, said Musk would likely pursue the biggest BTC treasury in the world and integrate Bitcoin across all his companies. He added that Musk could emerge as a leading global advocate for Bitcoin. The backdrop to this renewed push for Musk’s Bitcoin alignment is a growing personal and political rift with Trump. Their feud reignited after Musk publicly criticized Trump’s tax bill on June 3 by calling it a “disgusting abomination,” and intensified when Musk warned that Trump’s proposed global tariffs could trigger a recession later this year. In response, Trump claimed that canceling Musk’s federal subsidies and contracts could save the government billions of dollars. Musk has long shown interest in cryptocurrency,and recently announced that X will roll out XChats , a messaging feature with “Bitcoin-style encryption.” Although Tesla discontinued Bitcoin payments in 2021 due to environmental concerns, the company still holds digital assets, though the value of its holdings fell from $1.076 billion to $951 million in the first quarter of this year.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9484/global-crime-wave-forces-bitcoin-family-to-go-underground,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-09T06:02:57,"US-China Trade Talks Begin Today — Will Bitcoin and Ethereum React?","The post US-China Trade Talks Begin Today — Will Bitcoin and Ethereum React? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As US and China officials prepare for trade talks in London this Monday, crypto investors are curious about what this could mean for the crypto market. Will an agreement boost confidence in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum? Or could new tensions make prices swing wildly? Let’s see what could happen? US-China Trade Talk Set For Today Recently, U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will meet Chinese officials in London on Monday, June 9, 2025. Meanwhile, China confirmed that Vice Premier He Lifeng will join these discussions. However, this meeting comes after Trump had a “very good talk” with China’s President Xi Jinping last week, the first time they spoke since the trade war began in February. US-China Trade Battle The trade war between the US and China started earlier this year when President Trump raised taxes on products from China by 125% . China fought back with higher taxes on US products, and tensions between the two countries kept growing. At one point, trade tariffs climbed as high as 145%, creating massive uncertainty for businesses and financial markets worldwide. Perhaps, in May, a temporary truce was reached in Switzerland, with the US reducing tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% and China slashing its tariffs to 10%. Trade’s Impact On Crypto Market While all eyes are on these talks, crypto experts have a special reason to watch. In past trade disputes, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have acted as a haven when markets felt shaky. If Monday’s talks go well and the US and China agree to ease trade tensions, it could calm investors and lead to more stable crypto prices. But if talks collapse or tariffs rise again, Bitcoin and altcoins might see a surge as people look for assets that aren’t tied to governments or global politics. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Trump Coin & Tesla Stock Crash Big Amid Elon Musk & Donald Trump Feud: Here’s What’s Next! , Sentiment Shifting Towards Crypto On top of that, data from Santiment shows that more people are buying crypto than ever.

Bitcoin price was trading at $105,500, while the market capitalization of all tokens stood at $3.3 trillion. This article provides a forecast for top tokens like Quant (QNT), Bonk (BONK), and Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR). Quant price forecast QNT price chart | Source: TradingView Quant is a top cryptocurrency project that aims to provide institutions with the technology they need in building programmable money. It recently came into the spotlight after being selected as a participant in the digital euro project. Quant is also used by top companies like Oracle and Hitachi that deploy its Overledger solution. Overledger allows these companies to build tools that are interoperable across multiple blockchains. The daily chart shows that the Quant token price has been in a strong rally in the past few months, moving from $58 in April to $118 today. It is hovering at its highest point since January 18 this year. Quant token remains above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), a sign that bulls are in control. Oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD continue rising. Quant price is attempting to move above the key resistance level at $119.55, a move that will invalidate the forming double-top patter, whose neckline is at $103.25. A double-top is one of the most bearish chart patterns in technical analysis. QNT token has also moved above the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level. Therefore, moving above that level will point to more gains, potentially to the psychological point at $150. A move below the support at $103.25 will invalidate the bullish outlook.

This retreat happened after the token formed a double-top pattern at $0.00002575. It has now moved below the neckline point at $0.00001830. Bonk price has also plunged below the 50-day and 100-day EMAs, which have formed a mini death cross pattern. It has also formed a small bearish flag pattern, a common continuation sign. Therefore, the token will likely continue falling as sellers target the key psychological point at $0.000010. The bearish outlook will become invalid if the Bonk price rises above the key resistance level at $0.00001830. Hedera price analysis HBAR price chart | Source: TradingView Hedera Hashgraph’s HBAR token has been in a strong downtrend in the past few months, moving from a high of $0.40 in January to $0.1687 today. This plunge coincided with the ongoing decline in the supply of stablecoins on its network, a sign that activity is falling. The supply has dropped to $80 million from $180 million earlier last month. HBAR price remains below the descending trendline that connects the highest swings since January. It has also remained below the 50-day and 100-day EMA and the support at $0.1705. Hedera Hashgraph price will likely continue falling, with the next target being at $0.1250, its lowest point on April 7. A move above the resistance at $0.1895 will invalidate the bearish view.
