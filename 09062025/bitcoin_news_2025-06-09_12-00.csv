2025-06-09T09:55:33,"John Deaton Reveals Major XRP Holdings Amid Bitcoin Debate","The post John Deaton Reveals Major XRP Holdings Amid Bitcoin Debate appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto community is buzzing as pro-Ripple attorney John Deaton discloses that he holds a “substantial” amount of XRP. His statement comes after he was challenged on X over his recent pro-Bitcoin comments, prompting the former Massachusetts Senate candidate to clarify where he truly stands. The post I’m quoting is about BTC so my comment is. I clearly own a substantial amount of XRP. I’m just not someone who sees the two as mutually exclusive. We will operate in a world of more than one coin. — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) June 9, 2025 More on this below! Bitcoin at $106K? Deaton Calls It the Safer Bet Deaton stirred conversation by stating that Bitcoin is a safer investment at $106,000 than it was at $20,000, a bold stance backed by his macroeconomic outlook. He points to rising debt levels and relentless fiat money printing as key reasons for Bitcoin’s long-term potential. He also cited recent U.S. policy shifts, including the pro-Bitcoin BITCOIN Act and growing institutional and state-level adoption, as signals of a strong bullish trend for the top cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Bonanza: Deaton’s Daring Investment Call Still, Deaton isn’t married to just one narrative. In a recent post, he emphasized that Bitcoin and XRP are not mutually exclusive, stating , “We will function in a realm with multiple coins.” His sentiment echoes that of Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who recently urged XRP holders not to view the Bitcoin community as adversaries. This balanced stance reflects Deaton’s broader view of a multi-chain future, where competition doesn’t overshadow collaboration. From Paycheck Struggles to Crypto Power Move Adding depth to his story, Deaton shared a personal anecdote – just 15 years ago, he lived paycheck to paycheck. Today, he has 80% of his net worth in Bitcoin and is actively involved in real estate deals to increase his BTC holdings, despite already buying at sub-$25,000 prices. While many speculate on aggressive Bitcoin strategies, Deaton draws a firm line: he does not support mortgaging homes to buy BTC – a statement he clarified wasn’t directed at industry figure David Bailey. What Deaton’s Dual Strategy Signals for Crypto Deaton’s approach captures the evolving dynamic of today’s crypto market: one where XRP’s regulatory win, which confirmed it as a non-security, now coexists with Bitcoin’s explosive 150% rise this year, driven by economic uncertainty and legislative momentum like the GENIUS Act. By backing both XRP and Bitcoin, Deaton stands as a bridge between two powerhouse communities, promoting strategic thinking.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/john-deaton-reveals-major-xrp-holdings-amid-bitcoin-debate/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP","News",cryptocompare

2025-06-09T09:46:06,"Cathie Wood Predicts Bitcoin Uptrend: Check Out the Best Presales for 1000x Gains","ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood said she remains bullish on Bitcoin ($BTC), citing its ability to withstand ‘all kinds of turmoil.’ Could some of the best presales be next to hop on the Bitcoin gravy train? Speaking on Ark Invest’s ‘In the Know’ podcast on YouTube, Wood expressed her gratitude to Donald Trump’s administration for giving regulatory clarity on cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. ‘We think the financial services sector is going to reconfigure completely in the next five to ten years, and that of course Bitcoin and now Circle and of course Coinbase as well,’ Wood said. In April, Ark Invest projected Bitcoin could reach $710K by 2030. That may still be five years away, but there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic, especially with the growing number of institutional investors starting to hoard $BTC, including the US government . When Bitcoin regains momentum and breaks past its current all-time high of $111K, we expect altcoins and even the best crypto presales to ride this wave. The Best Presales to Surge with Bitcoin While buying even just 1 $BTC is already out of reach for most, crypto presales let you grab promising new tokens for much less money, and watch them rise with Bitcoin as it climbs to new heights. Here are some of the best-positioned presales to rise with Bitcoin. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Bet on Bitcoin’s Continued Rise The BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) presale rallies true Bitcoin believers to support its rally past the $150K mark and beyond. As a $BTCBULL holder, you’ll get the chance to receive free $BTC airdrops when Bitcoin hits $150K and $200K. Plus, you’ll get additional $BTCBULL tokens when $BTC reaches the $250K mark. You can also watch your $BTCBULL tokens’ value increase thanks to regular token burns when Bitcoin’s value hits $125K, $175K, and $225K. And based on our BTC Bull Token price prediction , exponential gains are possible in the next few years. Alternatively, you can stake your tokens to earn passive income. The staking rewards are currently at 58% p.a., although this can still change as more investors lock their tokens in the staking pool. To date, over 1.79B $BTCBULL tokens have been staked, accounting for about 8.5% of the total token supply. To get your hands on $BTCBULL, head on to the BTC Bull Token presale page . Next, connect your crypto wallet (you’ll need to use its partner, Best Wallet to claim your free airdops), enter the number of tokens you want to buy, and pay with your credit/debit card or crypto. Currently priced at $0.002555, $BTCBULL tokens are at their cheapest until the next price increase in three weeks. So if you want to get them at a discount, it’s best to buy $BTCBULL as soon as you can. Read more in our What is BTC Bull Token guide. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Buy and Store Bitcoin, Altcoins, and Meme Coins in a Secure Crypto Wallet If you prefer to buy Bitcoin rather than wait for free airdrops, you can consider getting Best Wallet instead. It’s a multi-chain, non-custodial crypto wallet that lets you do everything from buying Bitcoin, altcoins, and meme coins to the newest crypto presales via its Token Launchpad. To get the most out of the wallet, you can get its native Best Wallet Token ($BEST) . As a token holder, you’ll get exclusive perks, like early access to the best new crypto in presale, lower transaction fees, and governance rights, which let you have your say on the project’s direction. You can get your $BEST tokens from the Best Wallet Token presale page or the Best Wallet app . Each token is currently priced at $0.025155, but you only have about a day left before the next price increase. You can check out our Best Wallet Token buying guide for step-by-step instructions on how to purchase tokens. Of course, you can stake your tokens too. The project offers a generous 107% p.a. staking reward, which will be disbursed over three years. It’s a great way to earn passive income from your investment while supporting Best Wallet’s goal of being one of the top crypto wallets in the market. Read our full Best Wallet review and Best Wallet Price Prediction for more hints. 3. Bitcoin Pepe ($BPEP) – Unlock Your Bitcoin’s Value with the ‘Solana on Bitcoin’ Layer 2 Bitcoin Pepe ($BPEP) is a project that aims to capitalize on the surge in meme coins’ popularity along with Bitcoin’s reputation via a Layer 2 blockchain. With the project team dubbing it ‘Solana on Bitcoin’, it will introduce the speed, low transaction fees, and the familiar UX of Solana and combine it with Bitcoin’s security. With its L2, you’ll be able to deploy tokens on Bitcoin via the Bitcoin Pepe platform. As such, you’ll be able to go beyond just holding $BTC and waiting for its value to appreciate and boost its profit potential. Its $BPEP tokens are currently priced at $0.0396. But with only eight days left in the presale and the upcoming listing on major exchanges, it’s your last chance to get $BPEP at this low price. So, head on out to its presale page as soon as you can. Beyond Bitcoin: Boost Your Profit Potential with the Best Presales As more institutions embrace Bitcoin, it’s safe to say that its value can only go up over the long term. While most investors lean towards $BTC and the top altcoins, some of the best crypto presales also offer opportunities for massive gains, including BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) and Best Wallet Token ($BEST) . The crypto market is highly volatile, and there’s no real way to predict the future. That’s why you should never forget to do your own research before you invest, and only invest money you can afford to lose.

2025-06-09T09:44:08,"The future of non-custodial models in a post-Coinbase world | Opinion","Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. As the dust settles from the latest wave of phishing attacks, breaches, and increasing regulatory pressure, one thing is becoming abundantly clear: the era of centralized custody in crypto is reaching an inflection point. Coinbase may still stand tall as the poster child of exchange-driven adoption, but its growing vulnerabilities expose a systemic flaw. Users are still being asked to trust a third party with their assets, privacy, and safety. In a post-Coinbase world, this trust model is no longer sustainable. You might also like: Rethinking money in the web3 era: From capital to code, narrative, and moral design | Opinion The next chapter of crypto centers around non-custodial infrastructure—models that return control to the user without sacrificing security, usability, or speed. The “not your keys, not your coins” ethos is evolving from a rallying cry into an architectural blueprint for the next generation of crypto platforms. The trust crisis and its ripple effects Recent events, such as the estimated $300 million in phishing-related losses on Coinbase , as highlighted by investigators like ZachXBT, indicate that centralized platforms are being pushed to serve as banks, tech firms, and compliance officers all at once. But in doing so, they inherit the worst vulnerabilities of each model. The trust users place in these intermediaries becomes a single point of failure, exploited not just by hackers but by misaligned incentives and opaque systems. We are now seeing users, especially the next wave of adopters, demanding platforms that work like Coinbase, but without the custody. They want seamless on/off ramps, intuitive UI, and fast swaps—but without giving up sovereignty over their funds. What a post-Coinbase model looks like Most so-called “non-custodial” platforms still expect users to jump through hoops just to do the basics. Meanwhile, centralized giants like Coinbase built empires by prioritizing ease of use over core crypto principles. That tradeoff is no longer acceptable. The real opportunity now is to build platforms that don’t ask users to choose between control and convenience. Crypto should be as simple as swapping tokens in seconds. No logins, no account creation, no handing over your identity to a black box. Most fiat on-ramps still funnel users through third parties that operate like banks in disguise. The future is wallet-native, not broker-driven. We need KYC and payments infrastructure that supports sovereignty, not platforms that treat users like liabilities to be monetized. And let’s kill the fantasy that users are going to “bridge,” “wrap,” and “unwrap” every time they move across chains. No one has time for that. Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), and Cosmos Hub ( ATOM ), they should all work from one interface, no jargon, no jumping through tabs. If your product still requires a tutorial, it’s not ready for mass adoption. Lastly, security can’t mean telling people “don’t forget your seed phrase” and calling it a day. That’s lazy. Non-custodial platforms must bake in real protection—recovery options, phishing defense, smart defaults, without turning every user into their own IT department. To get there, the tooling layer must evolve. Non-custodial platforms can’t just mimic Coinbase’s front end; they need an entirely different backend philosophy. That means embedded wallets that users don’t have to manually manage, programmable permissions that can restrict risky transactions, and cryptographic recovery mechanisms that don’t rely on centralized email resets or paper backups. This is not about dumbing down crypto; it’s about abstracting the complexity without obscuring the control. Technical breakthroughs exist, from threshold signatures and stealth addresses to social recovery, but they need to be productized in a way that puts real power in users’ hands without overwhelming them. Equally important is shifting the narrative from fear-based adoption to empowerment. Centralized platforms preyed on users’ uncertainty: “Let us handle it, it’s too complicated.” The next wave will win by saying, “You’ve got this, and we’ve got your back.” That mindset shift will define which wallets, dApps, and protocols earn user loyalty in the post-Coinbase era. Crypto’s first decade was built on the backs of early adopters willing to navigate clunky interfaces, obscure terminology, and high-friction workflows. But the next billion users won’t tolerate that. They expect web3 to meet the standards set by their favorite apps. This means fast, clean, intuitive, and secure by design. The infrastructure that powers non-custodial finance must learn from the best of web2, without importing its exploitative models. That means prioritizing UX alongside protocol design, and treating users not as endpoints, but as co-owners of the network. We cannot afford to be rebranding the old playbook anymore. The real shift is happening—in tools that feel as seamless as Coinbase, but don’t ask you to hand over your keys, your data, or your trust.

In a June 6 post on X, Armstrong admitted that addressing the problem had become a “top priority” and invited affected users to contact Coinbase Support directly. “For longer than is acceptable, account freezes have been a major issue,” Armstrong said . “We’ve now reduced this by 82%, with more improvements coming.” AI Drives Drop in Coinbase Account Freezes The substantial progress comes after Coinbase brought in Dor Levi, a product team member, nine weeks ago with a dedicated mission to fix the problem. Levi revealed that the team made “significant investments” in improving the company’s machine learning models and infrastructure to enhance accuracy and reduce false triggers that led to account restrictions. “We’ve improved the precision and recall of our models, and as a result, there are fewer freezes,” Levi explained. While Coinbase will continue to freeze accounts when legally required—such as due to court orders or sanctions—Levi acknowledged that the overall user experience still falls short. “As a Coinbase customer myself, it doesn’t yet meet my own bar,” he said. Despite the improvements, some users remain frustrated. One reported being locked out of their account for over two years, while another said they left Coinbase entirely after an eight-month freeze. A third blamed the poor customer service experience, citing long wait times and difficulty speaking to live support staff. Security Concerns Still Linger After Breach The timing of this update comes as Coinbase attempts to restore user confidence following a mass data breach that compromised over 70,000 customer accounts . In that incident, malicious actors bribed overseas customer service contractors to access sensitive personal information, including government-issued IDs and home addresses. Although the breach occurred in December, it was only publicly disclosed in May. One X user even claimed their family friend lost Bitcoin and Ether due to a scam linked to the stolen data. Coinbase, which serves over 100 million users and is the largest custodian of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., has committed to reinforcing its security protocols. But for now, reducing account freezes is seen as a major step toward regaining trust among its global user base.

In a new video update, Lee shares a long-term chart for TSLA, which suggests that even after its 40% drop from all-time highs, the stock’s price is simply retouching a support level from previous years. “Tesla investors are used to this. If you take a step back and look at Tesla from its 2010 to now, when it went from $1 to $280 today, that decline that we’re seeing recently really looks like it’s just coming back to support, so I don’t think the long-term picture really has changed all that much for Tesla.” Source: Fundstrat Capital/YouTube Lee goes on to list what he believes are several bullish fundamental developments for Tesla, adding that Fundstrat isn’t “too concerned’ about TSLA’s price dip. “Let’s just review the competitive strength. Tesla has the lead in EV design, the lead in manufacturing electric vehicles, they have a robotaxi product coming soon – it’s going to start next week – and they have a competitive, vastly more competitive robotaxi design that costs roughly one-fourth that of the nearest competitor. And Tesla is planning to introduce Optimus Robots… And of course, there are drones potentially in the future. So when you look at the suite of products that Tesla has, it is pretty unmatched, and then there’s the possibility that they may merge xAI, which is their AI (artificial intelligence) unit that also owns the platform X.com, formerly known as Twitter. And with all that, I would say that Tesla of course, still holds all of its advantages, and so we aren’t too concerned about the decline.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-09T09:11:01,"Bitcoin Pepe price outlook as Cathie Wood sees BTC hitting $1.5M","The broader cryptocurrency market edged slightly higher on Monday, though sentiment remains fragile as last week’s volatility continues to cast a shadow over price action. Attention is now centred on the high-stakes US-China trade negotiations taking place in London. Scheduled talks between US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng are being closely watched by traders. Bitcoin is attempting to hold above the $105,000 level as it consolidates recent losses. At last check, BTC was trading at $105,628, still below the critical resistance at $106,058 — the highest closing level since December. A sustained move above that threshold could shift momentum back in favour of bulls, but absent a breakout, the threat of another leg lower persists. Amid this volatility, Cathie Wood, Founder and CEO of ARK Investment Management, has reiterated her ultra-bullish stance on Bitcoin, projecting that the cryptocurrency could reach a valuation of at least $1.5 million by 2030. Such a massive rally with not only benefit Bitcoin investors but also the broader cryptocurrency market. In a scenario where Bitcoin surpasses the $1 million, high-risk, high-reward tokens like Bitcoin Pepe could stand to gain disproportionately. The rally would likely reignite speculative fervour across the crypto market, driving capital toward smaller, meme-infused tokens with potential for explosive returns. Bitcoin Pepe, in particular, sits at a confluence of two potent narratives: infrastructure-level association with Bitcoin and meme-driven cultural momentum. This dual positioning enhances its appeal during bull runs, where investor appetite for novelty and asymmetric upside tends to spike. Cathie Wood’s Bitcoin prediction In a recent appearance on The Diary of a CEO, ARK Investment Management founder and CEO Cathie Wood reiterated her bold thesis that Bitcoin could surge to at least $1.5 million by 2030, citing a range of macro and structural tailwinds supporting long-term adoption. Wood identified institutional demand as a key growth catalyst, pointing to increased involvement from corporate entities. She argued that Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a credible investment vehicle rather than a speculative asset. “Bitcoin is more of an investment because it does appreciate over time,” Wood said. “Now you go through [it], it’s volatile. No question. And that’s the first thing people have to know about it. But it is becoming less volatile as more and more investors hold it.” According to her, institutions are only beginning to move into the Bitcoin market, suggesting the current level of adoption is still in its early stages. She expects accelerating demand as fund managers and corporate treasuries seek exposure to an asset that offers both diversification and growth potential. Wood also framed Bitcoin as the first new asset class in centuries, contrasting it with traditional categories like equities, bonds, real estate, and commodities that have dominated financial markets since the 1600s. In her view, this historical shift reinforces Bitcoin’s structural appeal and sets the stage for exponential price appreciation over the coming years. Bitcoin Pepe shows no signs of slowing A renewed surge in Bitcoin, driven largely by institutional capital inflows, is once again igniting risk appetite across the broader cryptocurrency market. Among the beneficiaries of this cycle is Bitcoin Pepe — a project positioning itself at the convergence of meme coin culture and infrastructure development. As the first meme-centric Layer 2 network on Bitcoin, Bitcoin Pepe seeks to combine the base layer security of Bitcoin with the scalability of Solana-like architectures. The project has garnered attention not only for its narrative but also for its execution. It has raised over $14 million in its ongoing presale ahead of a scheduled listing announcement on June 17, a figure that underscores investor interest as speculative capital shifts toward early-stage, high-upside plays. To strengthen its Layer 2 ecosystem, Bitcoin Pepe has secured strategic partnerships with projects such as Super Meme, Catamoto, and Plena Finance. Bitcoin Pepe is banking on sustained momentum and heightened visibility from Bitcoin’s rally to propel it into the spotlight as a serious contender in the next wave of crypto speculation.

2025-06-09T09:07:28,"AVL price spikes as Avalon Labs initiates deflationary cycle with 80M token burn","The altcoin market remained indecisive on Monday as Bitcoin oscillated around $105K. Meanwhile, AVL decoupled with substantial gains, driven by bullish ecosystem developments. On 9 June, Avalon Labs confirmed permanently removing 80 million AVL tokens from the circulating supply. The move comes as the project braces for the next chapter of business expansion and enriched demand. Avalon Labs 🎩🔮 @avalonfinance_ · Follow Avalon Labs has officially burned 80M $AVL , representing 44% of the circulating supply. These unclaimed airdrop tokens, worth approximately $16 million, have now been permanently removed from circulation. Over the past year, a total of $20M worth of $AVL has been claimed by 7:20 AM · Jun 9, 2025 72 Reply Copy link Read 12 replies AVL signaled bullishness before the announcement as it climbed from yesterday’s low of $0.1718. The coin saw a sharp 16% jump from $0.1864 to $0.2169 after Avalon Labs confirmed the burn, extending its gains by 26% since 8 June lows. This article analyzes what happened, why it matters for AVL holders, and what Avalonians and the Web3 community can anticipate in the upcoming times. Avalon Lab’s strategic token burn Avalon Lab’s asset incineration isn’t a usual token burn. While projects like Shiba Inu have periodic schedules for these events, Avalon plans to destroy $16 million in assets that users left untouched from last year’s airdrops. Rather than leaving 80 million coins lingering within the ecosystem, Avalon has removed them from circulation, making AVL’s scarcer. Notably, the burn represented 44% of AVL’s total circulating supply. That massive reduction welcomes the digital currency into a deflationary phase. Deflation is bullish as it tightens supply over time, often encouraging long-term holders as the token’s value increases. The team stated that the latest burn ushers in a new phase of Business expansion. They explained: As AVL enters a deflationary cycle, more value will be unlocked, aligning long-term incentives and strengthening the foundation of our ecosystem. Indeed, reduced asset supply could trigger upside pressure for AVL’s price, especially with increased utility and demand. The remaining coins now boast a little more strength due to scarcity. Moreover, Avalon Labs trusts this is the initial step toward a broader economic position. Tightened tokenomics likely set the stage for a sustainable and more robust ecosystem. Meanwhile, Avalon has distributed AVL assets worth over $20 million to more than 100K users in the previous year. The significant airdrop signals the project’s close ties with its community. Thus, the latest token burn isn’t about cleansing the house. The move looks to incentivize Avalon’s loyal followers, who have been supportive since its early stages. The project even referred to its loyal supporters as “key stakeholders.” AVL price outlook The native token hovers at $0.2108 after brief corrections from intraday highs. The massive 24-hour trading volume indicates revived optimism in AVL. Chart by Coinmarketcap However, the broad market outlook suggests limited rallies for Avalon’s token. Bears control the crypto space, and possible profit-taking could see AVL losing its latest gains. However, Bitcoin’s stability and rallies above $105K would support AVL’s continued surges.

2025-06-09T09:02:10,"Best Crypto to Buy Now as Bitcoin Eyes $115k in July Rally","The post Best Crypto to Buy Now as Bitcoin Eyes $115k in July Rally appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has rebounded strongly from its $100,000 support zone, holding steady above its 50-day moving average. Analysts believe Bitcoin could surge past $115,000 in June. The latest U.S. jobs data is expected to weaken, raising the odds of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in the coming months. Early investors are shifting focus to Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP), a rising star in the meme coin space. BPEP is pioneering the PEP-20 token standard, which will enable native asset minting on Bitcoin with the ease and efficiency of Solana’s architecture. Bitcoin is gearing up for another big breakout! After dipping to $74,420 in April, it bounced back strong, shooting up over 50% to hit a fresh all-time high of $112,000 . Over the past two weeks, though, it’s taken a 10% dip. But hey, most analysts think it’s just a healthy cooldown after that wild rally. Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s price has reached crucial support of $100,000, coinciding with a strong technical indicator: the 50-day moving average. A strong bounce from this support could propel the asset to a new high of $115k in the coming weeks. US employment data is an important indicator for financial markets that could impact Bitcoin’s price action. The data impacts the Fed’s interest rate decision, influencing sentiment toward Bitcoin and financial assets. While Bitcoin is aiming for a strong rebound, investors are scanning for the best crypto to buy now. If you’re seeking a project with strong fundamentals and explosive growth potential, here are the top picks: Bitcoin bounces off the strong support: Is a new ATH coming? On Friday, Bitcoin strongly rebounded from the $100k support level, due to growing optimism for a new all-time high for the asset. The rally could be fueled by continuous institutional buying, and US job data is “weaker-than-expected.” Bitfinex analysts recently commented on the report, “In a bullish scenario, driven by strong institutional interest and ETF inflows, Bitcoin could touch $115,000 or higher by early July.” Further adding, “A stronger-than-expected report might delay rate cuts, strengthening the dollar and possibly exerting downward pressure on Bitcoin,” Bitfinex analysts said. While short-term volatility may persist, investor confidence for long-term growth is strong. Savvy investors believe this is the right time to find potential opportunities before Bitcoin hits the $115k target. Bitcoin Pepe New Meme Coin Crypto Presale !!! Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) As Bitcoin retests a crucial support level, investors are rushing to Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) to get a running start with the continuation of the bull leg. It is the first meme-focused ICO on BTC, aiming to create a state-of-the-art meme trading platform that combines Solana’s speed and low gas fees with Bitcoin’s security and trust. Bitcoin is bringing “Solana on Bitcoin” with its revolutionary PEP-20 standard that will mimic the growth ERC-20 brought to the Ethereum blockchain. PEP-20 will enable everyone to mint assets natively on Bitcoin instantly without needing permission. This will bring all meme coins to Bitcoin and unlock the network’s $2 trillion dormant capital for unmatched liquidity. The team just released some leaked UI images, giving us a sneak peek at what they’ve been building—the BTC bridge, the Bitcoin Pepe DEX, and their slick new Layer 2 block explorer. It looks like things are really heating up behind the scenes! In its ongoing presale, BPEP has shattered records by raising over $13.9m. Currently, the BPEP token is available at $0.0396. The presale window is narrowing, and investors have a limited time to scoop up BPEP at this price until the next listing update on June 17. BPEP will list on major tier-1 CEXs after the presale, which is expected to provide a boost and take it to the moon in the 2025 bull run. Cardano (ADA) Cardano’s price delivered some highly welcome gains to its investors as the ADA rose over 40% YTD. The rise in Cardano’s price started with the announcement of the Strategic Crypto Fund and was supported by technical improvements being carried out in the ADA network. As one of the top crypto platforms, ADA is well known for its green policies and strong PoS protocols. Despite being known for scalability and eco-friendliness, ADA has been under pressure due to emerging technical challenges with higher network usage. These problems have impacted Cardano’s price performance, which has remained under pressure over the last few weeks. The future growth of Cardano’s price will depend on how well the ADA community receives its ongoing technical improvements. Currently, ADA is trading at $0.64, with a market value of $22.65 billion. The trading volume has increased by 74% in the last 24 hours, showing growing trading activity in ADA and a probable chance of a reversal. Sui Blockchain (SUI) SUI is a Layer-1 blockchain that focuses on the gaming community and offers its strong object-oriented design capabilities to ensure developers can build high-performance dApps. SUI coin plays a big role in the world of the Sui blockchain. People mostly use it to pay transaction fees, stake their tokens, and have a say in how the network runs. But that’s not all — SUI also powers DeFi apps, games, and NFT projects. Thanks to its speed and scalability, it’s got the muscle to handle a lot without slowing down. Pretty handy, right? As the trend moves towards utility-rich projects with real-world usage, names like SUI could grow continuously. SUI has faced a decline of over 30% in the market correction, which could take time to recover. The current SUI price is $3.02, which is down by 12% over the weekly charts. Best cryptocurrencies to watch before next BTC rally With big money pouring into Bitcoin ETFs and weak economic data likely on the way, Bitcoin is set to hit $115K soon. If that happens, we might be looking at the start of a full-blown altcoin season, just around the corner. As the crypto market prepares for a fresh bull run, the highest gain potential remains with the low-priced Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) , with its low entry point of $0.0396. If you’re looking to position ahead of the next rally, this may be the best crypto to buy right now, followed by ADA and SUI.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/best-crypto-to-buy-now-as-bitcoin-eyes-115k-in-july-rally/,"ADA|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|SUI","Information",cryptocompare

2025-06-09T09:00:22,"Best crypto to buy now as BTC remains wobbly above $105K","The broader cryptocurrency market ticked slightly higher on Monday, but underlying weakness continues to weigh on sentiment. Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple’s XRP are all struggling to sustain weekend gains, with price action showing signs of vulnerability following Thursday’s sharp pullback. Investor focus has now shifted to the US-China trade talks slated for Monday in London, which are emerging as a key volatility trigger. Markets remain wary after the May 12 Geneva discussions led to a temporary truce on tariffs, which sparked a quick rebound in US equities and a delayed lift in Bitcoin. This time, participants appear more cautious, likely due to fading confidence in sustained diplomatic progress. Bitcoin is currently consolidating above the $105,000 mark, attempting to stabilise after Thursday’s abrupt decline. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $105,621 — still struggling to breach the $106,058 resistance, which marks the highest monthly close since December. Unless bulls convincingly reclaim this level, the risk of another downside correction remains elevated. With Bitcoin potentially facing renewed volatility, retail investors are pivoting toward potentially high-reward tokens such as Bitcoin Pepe , now nearing the end of its presale phase. Speculative capital is flowing into early-stage crypto projects, as traders seek to capitalise on momentum-driven plays that offer outsized return potential. Amid this rotation, Bitcoin Pepe has emerged as a favoured choice for market participants. The trade talks in London US President Donald Trump announced Friday that a senior American delegation will meet Chinese officials in London, marking a fresh attempt to salvage trade relations between the world’s two largest economies. Beijing later confirmed that Vice Premier He Lifeng will lead the Chinese side at the negotiations. The planned meeting follows a phone call between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping last week, which Trump characterised as a “very good talk.” The conversation was their first since the trade dispute escalated in February and reportedly focused on finding a path forward on economic cooperation. Washington will send Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to the talks. Last month, the two nations agreed to a temporary truce that included a mutual reduction of import tariffs. However, tensions resurfaced as both sides accused each other of failing to uphold parts of the agreement. The upcoming talks are seen as critical in averting a full-scale trade breakdown. The meeting between US Trade Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng comes at a sensitive moment, with many crypto traders opting to de-risk in advance. The rotation out of major tokens signals a broader expectation that even minor setbacks in the talks could provoke another wave of sell-offs. Why Bitcoin Pepe is seeing continued momentum in this volatility Despite near-term turbulence in Bitcoin’s price action, its recent climb to new highs has lifted sentiment across the crypto landscape, conditions that have historically paved the way for broader market upswings. Within this risk-on environment, investors are once again gravitating toward speculative assets, with meme coins emerging early as key beneficiaries. Bitcoin Pepe is one such project gaining momentum, drawing interest for its effort to fuse viral internet culture with a blockchain infrastructure narrative. Now regarded as one of the most closely watched presales of 2025, Bitcoin Pepe has carved out a distinct identity through its stated mission to “build Solana on Bitcoin,” seeking to marry Bitcoin’s security with the scalability associated with Solana. Differentiating itself from meme coins that lean solely on community buzz, Bitcoin Pepe is emphasising a development roadmap with tangible technical goals. The presale has already brought in over $14 million, ahead of a listing announcement on June 17. With capital flowing into early-stage ventures, Bitcoin Pepe appears well-positioned to harness ongoing momentum as it approaches the close of its presale.

The company has announced plans to raise €300 million (around $340 million) to grow its Bitcoin treasury – marking one of the boldest crypto moves yet by a European firm. Already holding over $154 million in Bitcoin, Blockchain Group is now aiming to more than double down. It calls itself Europe’s first dedicated Bitcoin treasury company, and this new raise positions it to play a bigger role in shaping institutional crypto adoption across the region. The way they’re raising funds, who they’re partnering with, and what it says about Europe’s crypto market – it’s all worth a closer look. While the U.S. dominates headlines, Europe might be quietly setting up its own Bitcoin power players. Here’s what you must know. Borrowing from Wall Street’s Playbook Here’s what makes the move even more interesting – the structure of the raise. Inspired by the U.S. market’s At-The-Market (ATM) model, Blockchain Group will sell shares directly at market prices, in tranches, and only under certain limits. The shares won’t be dumped all at once, but released gradually, based on the previous day’s closing price or the volume-weighted average price, whichever is higher. There’s also a cap: no more than 21% of that day’s trading volume. It’s a mechanism designed to raise capital while maintaining market balance. The company plans to start small, with €500,000, and scale from there. This kind of fundraising isn’t commonly seen in European crypto firms. So, yes, it’s a clear sign that Blockchain Group wants to break out of the local mold and start playing on a much larger field. Source: Blockchain Group With TOBAM on Board, the Stakes Just Got Highe r The Blockchain Group isn’t going at it alone. It’s teamed up with TOBAM, a well-known asset manager, to handle the capital raise and ensure the funds are used smartly. TOBAM will help direct the new capital toward growth and profit-generating strategies. This move is about long-term business development with Bitcoin as the strategic core. Love to see it. Strategic Vision Comes from the Top Alexandre Laizet, the company’s Deputy CEO and head of Bitcoin strategy, has been vocal about the raise on social media. He’s made it clear: this is about more than just growing the treasury. It’s about global expansion. He mentioned that the company does not waver in managing Bitcoin investments, pointing to the group’s firm focus on yield and results. He believes the ATM program will further cement the company’s role as a top player in Europe’s Bitcoin market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market News Today: BTC, ETH & Top 10 Cryptos Consolidate, While KAIA and AB Lead the Markets , Valentin Kosanovic echoed the sentiment, calling the program a major step forward for the company’s global operations. For him, it’s about staying laser-focused – “121%,” in his words – on making Bitcoin a core driver of value. Move Aside, MicroStrategy! The timing is telling. Just days ago, MicroStrategy, still the largest corporate Bitcoin holder in the world, announced plans to raise $1 billion for more Bitcoin. Blockchain Group’s raise may be smaller, but it signals that Europe isn’t sitting this one out. Meanwhile, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have been seeing outflows – over $47 million on June 6 alone. But firms like Blockchain Group are pushing forward anyway, not reacting to short-term moves, but acting on long-term conviction. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Blockchain Group’s bold €300M Bitcoin treasury raise and strategic approach position it as a significant player, potentially leading institutional Bitcoin adoption in Europe similar to BlackRock’s influence in traditional finance. What happens if central banks adopt similar ATM-style raises for CBDCs? If central banks adopted ATM-style raises for CBDCs, it could significantly impact monetary policy transmission, financial stability, and the competitive landscape between central bank and commercial bank money. Can this capital raise influence macroeconomic policies around digital asset reserves in EU nations? Yes, this substantial capital raise by a European firm could encourage EU nations to re-evaluate and potentially formulate new macroeconomic policies regarding digital asset reserves and their role in national economies.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/europes-first-bitcoin-treasury-firm-plans-340m-btc-buy/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-09T08:47:42,"The Blockchain Group Starts 300M-Euro ATM Share Sale to Expand Bitcoin Holdings","The Blockchain Group (ALTBG), a tech firm that brands itself as Europe’s first Bitcoin Treasury Company, announced a share-issuance program worth up to 300 million euros ($342.5 million). The capital raise is structured as an at the market (ATM) program and backed by French asset manager TOBAM, a longtime investor in both bitcoin BTC and the Paris-listed company on behalf of clients, Blockchain Group said in a press release . The program allows TOBAM to buy new shares at its discretion, based on daily market conditions. The price of each tranche will be the higher of the previous day’s closing price or its volume-weighted average price, with purchase volume capped at 21% of the day’s trading activity, the firm said. Proceeds are expected to be used to purchase bitcoin, furthering the company’s stated goal of increasing its “bitcoins per share” metric over time. The Blockchain Group started buying bitcoin in November. Since then, it has amassed 1,471 BTC at an average price of $102,507, it said June 3. Unlike typical ATM programs in the U.S., which use brokers to sell stock into the market, TOBAM is acting in its own interest, not as an intermediary. It will decide whether to hold or sell the newly issued shares on its own criteria and won’t be compensated by the company for participating. If fully executed at recent market prices, TOBAM’s stake in the company could rise from 3% to over 39%. A shareholder vote scheduled for June 10 could expand the capital raise to 500 million euros. Shares in the company, which has a market cap of 543 million euros, have risen 20% today to 4.9 euros.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/09/the-blockchain-group-starts-300m-euro-atm-share-sale-to-expand-bitcoin-holdings,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Treasury Reserve Asset|Share sale|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-09T08:47:22,"Hyperliquid whales are stocking up on HYPE, pricing in another breakout rally","Whales are back to buying Hyperliquid’s HYPE token, awaiting a breakout as the token hovers close to its higher range. At least three whale wallets were spotted taking HYPE positions in recent days. Attention for Hyperliquid is increasing, as three more whale wallets accumulated HYPE. The token recovered to $34.88, still within a small rally to its all-time peak. Two whales allocated a total of $3.5M to acquire HYPE above $35. The buying happened on-chain, raising demand for spot HYPE. The whales acquired HYPE in a series of spot purchases. The third whale placed a limit buy order at $24.95, betting on a potential correction. According to Nansen, the whales are generally high-balance traders, with previous records of meme token buying. Most of their other balances are relatively small compared to their HYPE positions. The whales were not active on the derivative market, only buying spot HYPE. One of the buyers with over 224.2M HYPE was ranked 81st based on his whale-sized holdings. HYPE still traded near its three-month high, as the perpetual futures DEX continued to build its influence. The whale buying coincided with a small expansion of open interest to $1.39B. The open interest on HYPE trends toward long positions, at over 53% of all trades. The native HYPE token is used for rewards and liquidity, but recently also gained a position as a meme token. HYPE also expects some irrational buying and enthusiasm, in place of other memes. The token has relatively small insider holdings and is not threatened by selling pressure from VC backers. The token gains attention from the role of Hyperliquid in the crypto ecosystem. Public whale positions and trades, completely transparent with on-chain execution, are actually signaling the available liquidity on the DEX. HYPE expected to benefit from Hyperliquid growth One of the narratives for HYPE is that it would peak and crash. Hyperliquid achieved peak volumes and liquidity in May, coinciding with the token’s price records. In June, the question remains whether Hyperliquid can retain its growth pace or face a setback. Hyperliquid searches on Google slowed down, though HYPE saw a small uptick in interest. Searches for HYPE had an uptick, as the asset remains closely watched for its irrational rally potential. | Source: Google Trends Additionally, Hyperliquid lost some of its stablecoin liquidity. Since the peak 2.9B USDC in May, the available liquidity is down to $2.72B. In June to date, the DEX carried $45B in volumes, following the peak of over $248B in May. Hyperliquid is still gaining on Binance, currently making up around 45% of the spot volume on the leading centralized exchange. James Wynn still posts Hyperliquid positions The risky trader James Wynn still posts his high-leverage positions, though this time, posting a much smaller collateral. Previously, Wynn had been liquidated for $100M, but has currently switched to positions in the hundreds of dollars, mostly serving as engagement bait. Update: My $468.62 short position is in the hole approx $78.07c. #PrayForJamesWynn This is all I have. https://t.co/FVsrXVXmRh pic.twitter.com/F6RnTjaUJR — James Wynn (@JamesWynnReal) June 8, 2025 Previously, Wynn also explained that Hyperliquid was not paying or offering any rewards for his trading moves, despite the fact that they drew more attention to the DEX. Wynn admitted he only received around $34,000 from referrals. Currently, Wynn is still bullish on BTC, expecting a big breakout, while also promoting the Moonpig meme token.

2025-06-09T08:40:04,"Early Bitcoin Adopter to XRP Holders: Don’t Sell Your XRP for This Elon Musk Reason","An early Bitcoin adopter and crypto enthusiast, Pumpius issued a direct warning to XRP holders, urging them not to sell their assets amid what he describes as an orchestrated distraction involving public tensions between Elon Musk and Donald Trump. His tweet emphasizes that the perceived feud is not merely a spectacle, but rather a calculated diversion hiding a much deeper shift in the financial world. Pumpius began his statement with a strong message : “DON’T SELL YOUR $XRP. Not now. Not during this.” He dismissed the Elon vs Trump conflict as a distraction, characterizing it as “the smoke hiding something much bigger.” According to his view, this high-profile public drama is not organic or accidental, but rather part of a broader strategy designed to manipulate investor behavior during a pivotal transition in the financial system. Engineered Volatility and Distraction Tactics He pointed to a historic pattern: when billionaires engage in public disputes, significant developments are often unfolding behind the scenes. He contends that “market volatility is engineered” and “narratives are weaponized,” suggesting that media coverage and public debate are being used intentionally to steer the attention of retail investors away from structural changes happening in global finance. For Pumpius, these tactics are aimed at distracting and dividing investors so that they miss critical signals about the evolving financial landscape. DON’T SELL YOUR $XRP . Not now. Not during this. Elon vs Trump isn’t a distraction. It’s the smoke hiding something much bigger. And if you sell now, you’ll be exit liquidity for the next financial reset. Let me explain. pic.twitter.com/QvVyxW6lve — Pumpius (@pumpius) June 6, 2025 XRP’s Strategic Role in the New Financial System Central to his argument is the role of XRP. Pumpius stressed that XRP is not just a digital token, but rather a critical component of what he calls the “backbone of institutional liquidity rails.” He referenced recent developments, including regulatory approval for XRP in Dubai, the integration of RippleNet with central banks, the launch of RLUSD (Ripple’s new stablecoin), and the alignment of scheduled escrow unlocks with current global instability. According to the Pundit, these developments point to a broader transformation in cross-border financial infrastructure, for which XRP is designed. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Retail Exit Pressure as the Financial Reset Approaches He insisted that these events are not coincidental. “Musk vs Trump = perfect trigger,” he wrote, asserting that the clash is being used to “divide the retail crowd” and “suppress attention on what actually matters.” In his view, while investors are preoccupied with media narratives, the infrastructure for a new financial system is quietly being activated. Pumpius argued that the underlying goal is not to acquire XRP from retail holders, but rather to shake them out of their positions. He stated that engineered distractions are designed to instill fear, uncertainty, and doubt, leading individuals to sell prematurely. Those who exit their positions now, he warned, may serve as “exit liquidity for the next financial reset.” A Message of Patience and Strategic Awareness “Don’t get shaken out,” he warned, concluding with a call for resilience. He clarified that his perspective does not require belief in conspiracy theories, but rather an understanding of incentives. Institutions are not broadcasting XRP’s utility on mainstream platforms, he explained. Instead, they are building its foundational role in boardrooms and private sectors. While public focus remains fixed on the Musk-Trump conflict, Pumpius claimed that the XRP Ledger is already processing millions of transactions per second. He described this period as historically significant. A time when retail attention is being diverted, while a suppressed asset like XRP begins to assume a central role in the new financial framework. The message from Pumpius is clear: XRP holders should remain focused and resist selling during what he perceives as a critical moment. His conclusion was resolute: “HODL. Don’t get shaken out. Don’t sell XRP.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-06-09T08:36:16,"These Altcoins Pop as Bitcoin Battles to Reclaim $106,000 (Market Watch)","Crypto prices remained relativey calm during the weekend, especially for the larger-cap coins, most of which retained their valuations or are trending slightly higher. Bitcoin tested $106,000 but the bulls failed to sustain the price above that level, which was followed by a slight retrace to around $105,500. Nonetheless, the week is packed with important economic events, so let’s dive into it. Bitcoin Bulls Battle for $106,000 At the time of this writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $105,500, charting a very slight increase of around 0.2% throughout the past 24 hours. Its weekly gains are also comparable. As seen in the chart below, the leading cryptocurrency was able to stage a full recovery from the drops that it witnessed during the clash between Donald Trump and Elon Musk earlier last week. Over the past couple of days, it even managed to hit $106,500, but the bulls were unable to sustain the pressure. Source: TradingView The market seems to be equalizing, which is evident from the declining amount of liquidations across derivatives positions. During the past 24 hours, around $125 million worth of both long and short positions were wiped off, which is relatively low, as opposed to periods of more serious volatility. That all might be about to change, though, because this week is packed with important economic events that might boost the market turmoil. CPI numbers are expected on Wednesday, which will reveal how the country is faring against inflation. Typically, this is associated with heightened short-term volatility. The PPI report is also slated for later in the week. The US and China will continue their trade talks starting today. Any development in this regard is surely to ignite a response as well. These Altcoins Outperform While the majority of the large-cap cryptocurrencies are trading flat for the most part today, some altcoins are charting more considerable gains. For example, Internet Computer (ICP) is up by 8.3%, while the popular meme coins Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) and SPX69000 (SPX) are up by almost 7% each. All in all, the market remains mostly in red but, as we mentioned, the declines are not serious.

2025-06-09T08:30:05,"XRP Bull Trap Incoming? Analyst Sees $2.40 Fakeout Before Painful Crash","Pseudonymous analyst CryptoInsightUK has warned that the next major move for XRP could be a trap. In a video published on June 8, the analyst outlined a scenario where XRP surges toward $2.30–$2.40 in the short term—only to reverse violently into a sharp liquidity flush before any sustainable breakout occurs. XRP Bull Trap Looming? “I think XRP goes to sub-$2.0. I really do,” he said, adding: “It could come and sweep the highs here… could come up to like what, $2.30, and then push us down. That would be more pain for everyone, ‘cause everyone’s going to think we’re going to the upside.” The setup he describes is based on market structure and liquidity dynamics, particularly the buildup of resting orders beneath XRP’s current range. “This here is a concern, a real concern for me,” he said, referring to the growing pool of liquidity below current prices. According to his internal models, such liquidity zones are statistically touched “80% of the time.” Related Reading: XRP Must Crash First—Then Comes The $10 Rally, Says Analyst “Someone’s trying to trick someone here,” he warned. “I’m cautious.” Despite his near-total XRP allocation—he states he’s “95%+, probably more like 98%” positioned in XRP—CryptoInsightUK emphasized that he’s not rooting for a correction. “I don’t want it to come down,” he said. “I’m just showing you what I see.” The analyst proposed multiple structural paths: one in which XRP immediately breaks out, and another where it briefly rallies to sweep local highs before flushing downward to form a bullish divergence. “We’re in a range right now,” he said. “Do we come up, sweep the highs, then take the lows and go?” He elaborated on the bullish divergence pattern he is watching, where price forms a lower low while the RSI (Relative Strength Index) prints a higher low—a setup he uses to identify bottoming structures. “That’s what I would like to see,” he explained. Broader Macro Conditions Still Supportive Despite the bearish tactical setup, the video struck an upbeat macro tone. Will cited four near-term catalysts: the Genius Act on stablecoin oversight, the imminent filing deadline in the SEC’s remedies phase against Ripple, the July decision window for a spot-XRP ETF proposal, and a renewed expectation of accommodative fiscal policy sparked by last week’s televised Trump-Musk dialogue. “What this really tells us is there’s going to be money printing,” he argued. “Assets all over are going to explode to the upside and, for the other specific reasons, XRP probably does even better.” Turning to Bitcoin, the analyst observed an ongoing decline in trading volume, suggesting indecision or exhaustion. “There’s been no volume. There’s been nothing,” he said of recent BTC price action. Related Reading: XRP Wave Structure Predicts Wild Fluctuations On Its Way To $4 ATH He highlighted a CME futures gap around $92,000–$93,000 and added that fixed range volume analysis points to a possible pullback zone at $96,000–$97,000. “It’s probably coming imminently, maybe this week,” he said of a potential correction, projecting a scenario where BTC dips into this range before resuming its upward trajectory. “Does this mean we squeeze to the upside or come down and take this low and put in that bullish divergence structure?” he asked, noting a similar divergence setup at $75,000 earlier this year. XRP Spot Activity Raises Red Flags In the final hour before the video, XRP had “squeezed up with some volume,” but the analyst urged caution. While open interest had risen sharply, funding remained green—suggesting net long positioning—and aggregate premium had turned red. “This indicates to me that even though there are still some shorts coming in, more longs than shorts have entered,” he said. He warned that this imbalance could cause a sharp move lower if the market fails to hold current levels. “If we do now come down and lose this low, expect a more aggressive, faster move to the downside,” he said, pointing to the risk of liquidating leveraged positions. XRP’s relative performance against ETH and BTC also came under review. While it had begun testing resistance zones, neither the XRP/ETH nor the XRP/BTC charts had decisively broken out. “We could still be in this range chopping about,” he cautioned. “Could lose strength until we start to see some confirmations to the upside.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.23.

The filing, submitted on June 2, shows Nasdaq is planning to expand the index from five to nine cryptocurrencies by adding XRP, Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Stellar Lumens (XLM). The proposal could change the ETF from its current benchmark, the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index (NCIUS), to the broader Nasdaq Crypto Index (NCI). The SEC is expected to decide on this proposal by November 2, 2025. Nasdaq engages the SEC to expand the Hashdex Crypto Index Due to regulatory constraints, the Hashdex ETF holds only Bitcoin and Ethereum, even though the index it tracks, before the Form 8-K filing, included six cryptos. Hashdex is using a sampling mechanism to mitigate tracking errors, but the index’s market alignment is currently unattainable until regulatory clarity is achieved. Pending approval, the Nasdaq Crypto Index (NCI) now includes nine digital assets: Bitcoin , Ethereum, XRP, Solana, Cardano, Stellar Lumens, Chainlink, Litecoin, and Uniswap. Against the backdrop of Nasdaq’s SEC filing, XRP saw modest gains, moving above $2.23 during Monday’s early trading sessions, and is 3.1% up from its weekly lows. Solana pushed its price to near $155 after plummeting closer to the $140 mark last Friday. The token saw a gain of 0.2% intraday, and a 36% trading volume increase within the same period. Cardano continued its trend of weekly losses, now changing hands at the $0.67 range, while Stellar Lumens also recorded losses of over 1% in the week of Nasdaq’s announcement. Leadership changes at Hashdex Sponsor The Nasdaq filing also included news about two leadership changes at Hashdex Asset Management Ltd., the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF sponsor. On June 2, 2025, Bruno Leonardo Kmita de Oliveira Passos resigned from the sponsor’s Board of Directors position. His departure also ended his tenure as the Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer of the Trust. According to regulatory disclosures, Mr. Passos’s resignation was not linked to any disagreement with the Trust or the Sponsor on matters related to operations, policies, or practices. Effective the same day, Samir Elias Hachem Kerbage was appointed to replace Mr. Passos on the Board of Directors and in his executive roles. Kerbage currently serves as Chief Investment Officer at Hashdex and has led the firm’s investment strategy since 2018. Industry calls for change in SEC ETF Approval Process In other related news, leading asset managers are asking the SEC to change current ETF approval strategy. On June 6, VanEck, 21Shares, and Canary Capital co-signed a letter to the SEC calling for the agency to reinstate the “first-to-file, first-to-approve” policy for exchange-traded products (ETPs). SEC favoritism undermines innovation in the ETF market. pic.twitter.com/HM7P2Dm0XP — VanEck (@vaneck_us) June 6, 2025 The letter, published on VanEck’s official X account, lambasted the SEC for approving multiple crypto ETFs simultaneously, regardless of submission dates. The fund managers argue that this approach disadvantages early filers, and disproportionately benefits larger firms with more resources. “ When the Commission plays favourites, it costs ETP sponsors money and makes the ETP marketplace less fair ,” the letter read, referencing the 2021 approval of ProShares’ Bitcoin futures ETF. The product’s early approval gave it a dominant 90% market share within days of launch. The joint letter also mentioned the SEC’s January 10, 2024, approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs on the same day. Ethereum ETFs also received the “go-ahead” in a similar fashion months later. VanEck and 21Shares, among the earliest to file for Bitcoin and Ethereum spot products, were grouped with later applicants during final approvals. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

And Which Coin Will Rise From It? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News When Two Titans Collide, the Market Feels Every Shock Elon Musk and Donald Trump’s clash on X didn’t just light up headlines , it shook the financial world. Tesla stock nosedived, crypto took a hit, and within hours, Bitcoin dropped below $101,000 while Ethereum slipped over 6 percent. The fallout wiped out $170 billion from the market. It wasn’t just price drops. Over $950 million in long positions vanished as liquidations swept across exchanges. Trump mocked Musk’s leadership at Tesla, Musk clapped back, and traders scrambled. Was this genuine tension , or a carefully timed shakeup? The debate is on. Some see it as a market reset, designed to scare off weak hands. Others feel it’s just chaos as usual. But for those paying close attention, moments like this are where new opportunities begin. Crypto Markets Shudder as Two Power Players Go Head-to-Head Volatility Spikes, But a Few Investors Spot the Pattern The Musk-Trump fallout didn’t just stay on social media. It triggered a wave of panic in markets, especially crypto. While most ran for cover, a handful of investors stayed calm , and looked deeper. They saw beyond the red charts. Some believe this is more than a feud , it could be an intentional move to reset sentiment and prepare for bigger plays ahead. Whatever the truth, it sparked a wave of exits , and quietly, a wave of entries. Because while most were watching the drama, some were watching a new name rise.

2025-06-09T08:08:38,"Here’s How Bitcoin’s Price Gets to $1 Million (Adam Back)","Once, the idea of the price of Bitcoin (BTC) hitting $1 million sounded like moon-talk, but this notion seems to be changing from fringe speculation into a mainstream investment thesis, championed by some of crypto’s most influential figures. Fueled by growing institutional adoption and bold long-term forecasts, the pathway to this price target hinges on a seemingly simple, yet monumental, shift: Wall Street allocating a significant slice of its vast wealth to the number one digital asset. Wall Street is the Game-Changer At the recent Bitcoin 2025 event, Strategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor emphatically stated: “When Wall Street is 10% Bitcoin, Bitcoin will be $1,000,000 a coin.” According to him, this level of allocation would equate to as much as $20 trillion flowing into BTC markets, making a hostile takeover economically impossible as aggressive buying would only empower existing holders. The Bitcoin maxi isn’t alone in his mega-bullish outlook. Blockstream CEO Adam Back believes BTC could achieve the $1 million target way before Wall Street accumulates 10% of the cryptocurrency. He suggested that even a widespread 2% allocation across major asset managers like BlackRock would be enough to push Bitcoin’s price to that level. It is not the first time Saylor has predicted BTC’s price hitting seven figures. In a September 2024 interview with CNBC, he forecasted a long-term price for the king cryptocurrency of $13 million, calling it “perfect money” in contrast to fiat currencies, which he labeled “pseudoscience.” Other prominent voices such as former Binance chief Changpeng Zhao, popularly known as CZ, have echoed similar sentiment. The crypto entrepreneur previously projected BTC could end up anywhere between $500,000 and $2 million in this cycle. Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest is another entity sharing the optimism. In April, the firm revised its base case target for BTC to $1.2 million by 2030, with a bullish estimate of $2.4 million. ARK attributed the potential surge to institutional adoption, especially via spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as well as Bitcoin’s growing role as a decentralized, programmable store of value. In the company’s estimation, all bets would be off if BTC manages to capture at least 6.5% of the projected $200 trillion global investable assets market. This would dwarf gold’s current share at roughly 3.6%, a comparison backed by data that Bitcoin enthusiast and early stage angel investor Fred Krueger recently shared , showing that more Americans now own Bitcoin (49.6 million) than gold (36.7 million), with significantly higher average holdings. Price Performance Meanwhile, BTC’s price action reflects a market digesting its recent surge to a new all-time high of $111,814. At the time of this writing, the asset was trading at $105,466, after oscillating between $105,112 and $106,365 in the last 24 hours. On the weekly timeframe, it gained a modest 0.6% to outperform the broader crypto market, which dipped 0.8% in that period. Zooming out some more, BTC’s current price is a 2.1% improvement over the last month, while on a yearly basis, it has soared 52.2%, highlighting a long-term uptrend with brief pullbacks.

That would make Tether the 19th largest company in the world, ahead of giants Costco and Coca-Cola. Ardoino acknowledged that the figure was impressive, but said the estimate was “a bit cautious” given Tether’s growing Bitcoin and gold reserves. Tether’s IPO valuation is driven by the current market cap of Circle, one of its largest competitors in the industry, at $30 billion. According to internal financial models, Circle will reach $410 billion in EBITDA in 2025, which is priced at a 69.3 multiple. Related News: Whale Activity Indicator at Its Peak in On-Chain Data - Here Are the Altcoins They Are Trading Tether, which announced a net profit of $13 billion for 2024, is reported to have earned $7 billion of this profit from Treasury bonds and repo transactions. The remaining $5 billion in profit consists of unrealized gains on Bitcoin and gold assets; these gains are not included in EBITDA calculations. Over the next year, Tether is expected to increase its USDT supply by another $50 billion to $60 billion, and will operate with an average USDT supply of $170 billion. With an average Fed interest rate of 4.2%, this would translate into EBITDA of around $7.4 billion in 2025. Based on Circle’s valuation multiple, this EBITDA figure could give Tether a market cap of $515 billion. *This is not investment advice.

The company thanked its users for helping shape the ecosystem and said it remains focused on aligning incentives between the project and its community. Token burns are designed to reduce supply, potentially increasing scarcity and price over time. In this case, market response was swift. AVL surged over 18% shortly after the announcement and ranked #1 in futures buys on Bybit. Avalon Labs is a financial technology company that is building Bitcoin-backed on-chain capital markets. The platform has already disbursed more than $1.2 billion in overcollateralized BTC-backed loans. To extend this model to institutional clients, it recently obtained a $2 billion credit line from prominent Asian conglomerates.

Users can deposit FBTC, a 1:1 Bitcoin-pegged asset, and borrow Tether ( USDT ) at fixed rates, funds that are deployed into high-yield strategies via platforms like Ethena Labs ( ENA ). Avalon operates across 20+ public blockchains and 50+ isolated lending markets, with total value locked exceeding $1.1 billion, as per DefiLlama data . The burn follows several major developments for Avalon Labs. On May 26, YZi Labs, formerly Binance Labs, announced an undisclosed investment in Avalon, boosting the project’s institutional backing.

2025-06-09T07:43:17,"Nasdaq Adds XRP to Settlement Price Index — How Will XRP Price React?","Key Takeaways: XRP has been added to the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index. Current SEC restrictions prevent Hashdex’s ETF from holding XRP, though a rule change decision is pending. XRP price faces short-term bearish pressure, with key resistance at $2.30 and downside risk toward $2.14. XRP has joined the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, a move that could further open the door to institutional exposure and reshape liquidity across key markets. On June 6, asset manager Hashdex updated its Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), outlining changes to its benchmark. According to the filing, Nasdaq expanded the index on June 2 to include XRP, alongside Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Stellar Lumens (XLM). Previously, the index was limited to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Hashdex’s NCIQ ETF Tracks This Index Hashdex’s ETF, which trades under the ticker NCIQ, tracks this index, providing market-cap weighted exposure to BTC and ETH within a regulated framework. However, current SEC restrictions prevent the ETF from holding any digital assets beyond BTC and ETH, a limitation that may introduce tracking risk now that XRP and others are included in the benchmark. “Under current regulatory restrictions, the Trust is only permitted to hold bitcoin and ether, and is not permitted to hold the new index constituents,” the filing states. “As such, the risk of potential tracking error is increased.” Separately, Nasdaq submitted a proposed rule change in March that would allow the ETF to track the broader Nasdaq Crypto Index (NCI), which already includes XRP, SOL, ADA, XLM, Chainlink (LINK), Litecoin (LTC), and Uniswap (UNI). XRP was officially added to the NCI on June 3, 2024. Should the SEC approve Nasdaq’s rule change, Hashdex’s ETF would be able to hold all NCI constituents — a potential game-changer for XRP’s institutional footprint. A final SEC decision is expected by November 2. Bears Pressure XRP Despite Nasdaq Index Inclusion XRP is trading near $2.22 after a volatile weekend, with technical signals pointing toward bearish momentum in the short term. On the 2-hour chart, XRP faced strong resistance around $2.30 and failed to sustain upward momentum, retreating to the lower Bollinger Band at $2.14. RSI stands at 51.52, indicating neutral momentum but leaning toward overbought after recent rallies. The MACD remains flat, signaling indecision among traders. On the 30-minute chart, XRP shows a sharper downward trend. RSI is at 34.32, approaching oversold territory, while the MACD remains negative, reinforcing near-term bearish pressure. The price has struggled to stay above the $2.25 support, suggesting sellers remain in control. The 1-minute chart confirms short-term weakness, with RSI falling to 32.74 and MACD in negative territory. Buyers are failing to generate sustained volume, with recent bounces quickly sold off. Despite XRP’s inclusion in the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, institutional flows have yet to lift price action meaningfully. Unless XRP reclaims $2.30 with strong volume, further downside toward $2.14 remains likely. Traders should monitor broader market sentiment and upcoming SEC decisions that could affect institutional access to XRP-based products.

2025-06-09T07:21:31,"Cathie Wood: Bitcoin’s value will multiply 15x in the next five years","Founder and CEO of ARK Investment Management, Cathie Wood believes Bitcoin’s value will reach at least $1.5 million by the time 2030 rolls around, growing by 15x from its current price. In a recent interview on the YouTube channel The Diary of a CEO, Wood breaks down the main reasons why she believes BTC ( BTC )’s value is bound to skyrocket to at least $1.5 million within the next few years. The ARK Investment CEO mentioned several core pillars which make up the “building blocks” of BTC’s growth in the market. One of the major drivers is institutional investments from corporate holders such as Arkham, Strategy and Metaplanet. “Bitcoin is more of an investment because it does appreciate overtime. Now you go through [it], it’s volatile. No question. And that’s the first thing people have to know about it. But it is becoming less volatile as more and more investors hold it,” she said in the interview. According to Wood, a lot of institutional investors have just started to gravitating towards BTC. Therefore, she believes the crypto space will see a flurry of demand from institutional holders who see the appeal of Bitcoin as a new asset class that offers diversification for business portfolios. Wood remarked that the world has not had a new asset class since the 1600s with the introduction of equities. Since then, the global market’s has been occupied by the same traditional assets including stocks , bonds, commodities and real estate . However now, there is a recent shift towards Bitcoin as a desirable asset. “If this asset does not perform like other assets, in other words, it provides diversification for funds. And because it is behaving differently, institutions have to consider it,” said Wood. Price chart for Bitcoin in the past few hours of trading, June 9, 2025 | Source: crypto.news You might also like: Cathie Wood predicts Bitcoin’s $2t market cap will soon flip gold after hitting $100k milestone Wood believes the institutional players currently rushing to adopt Bitcoin are late, considering there is only 1 million BTC left to be minted by miners, which represents only around $100 billion worth of untapped capital. “So they’re [institutions] just now committing and there’s only $100 billion of new market cap that is going to be created. Whereas they have trillions of dollars under management,” said Wood. “And so we think there will be a lot of incremental demand, and to satisfy a lot of that demand. Someone’s going to have to sell,” she continued. Institutional appetite for Bitcoin Wood’s statement indicates a wider trend among institutional investors which are just now discovering the advantages of holding Bitcoin. Back in May, Matrixport analysts found that unlike previous bull markets, the rally that raised BTC to a new all-time high of $111,814 was mostly driven by institutional demand, instead of the retail investors. This means that more institutional investors such as major companies and financial management firms are crowding the market now more than ever before. In fact, at least 61 corporate treasuries currently hold a combined 3.2% of the total BTC supply according to Standard Chartered’s Bitcoin report. Most recently, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet announced its plans to acquire 210,000 BTC by 2027, aiming to own 1% of the total supply of global BTC. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s Strategy remains the largest corporate holder of BTC, possessing 580,955 BTC as of June 9, holding around 2.7% of the total Bitcoin supply. As previously reported by crypto.news, ARK Invest recently upped its Bitcoin price forecast in the firm’s April report to $2.4 million by 2030 if its on-chain financial services grow at a 60% annual rate.
