2025-06-09T13:50:07,"Bitcoin on Exchanges Hits 7-Year Low, Supply Shock Looms","Per Glassnode data, BTC on exchanges dropped below the 11% mark, a scenario last seen in March 2018. This significant decline to approximately 2.3 million BTC reflects a shift in investor behavior and market structure, with implications for Bitcoin's liquidity and price dynamics Why is a Hodling Trend Skyrocketing in the Bitcoin Ecosystem? Coins leaving exchanges in droves is deemed bullish because they are held for future purposes other than speculation. As a result, selling pressure decreases because cryptocurrencies are usually kept in exchanges for liquidation purposes. Since this trend is playing out in the BTC network with exchange balances being at a 7-year low, more holders are moving their coins to digital wallets and cold storage, showing long-term confidence. CryptoQuant data also shares similar insights that Bitcoin’s hodl level has hit a 2-year high, according to the Bitcoin exchange flows to network activity ratio. This measure, also known as the Fund Flow Ratio, is a key on-chain metric that measures the proportion of Bitcoin moving through exchanges relative to the total transaction volume on the network. It's calculated by dividing the total exchange inflows and outflows by the total amount of Bitcoin transferred across the entire network. One primary factor contributing to exchange balance dropping is the migration of Bitcoin holdings from exchanges to institutional custodians, particularly following the approval of Bitcoin Spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January 2024. Major asset managers, including BlackRock and Fidelity, have accumulated substantial Bitcoin reserves for their ETF products, often utilizing custodians like Coinbase. This movement has led to a reclassification of holdings, where assets previously counted as exchange balances are now under institutional custody. Banking giant JP Morgan recently revealed that it could accept Bitcoin ETF shares for loans , in the process, unlocking new credit lines. Delving Deeper into Bitcoin’s Supply Shock Scenario A supply shock occurs when the availability of an asset diminishes while demand remains steady or increases, often leading to a price surge. In Bitcoin's case, several converging factors have the potential of creating a notable supply shock: 1. Post-Halving Scarcity and ETFs Bitcoin's protocol includes a halving event approximately every four years, reducing the reward miners receive for adding new blocks to the blockchain. The most recent halving in April 2024 decreased the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, effectively halving the rate at which new bitcoins enter circulation. This reduction tightens supply, especially as demand continues to grow. The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs has provided institutional investors with a regulated avenue to gain exposure to Bitcoin. 2. Corporate Treasury Adoption An increasing number of companies are incorporating Bitcoin into their corporate treasuries as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. As of June 2025, 80 firms collectively own around 3.4% of the total Bitcoin supply. Notable examples include MicroStrategy, which holds approximately 580,000 BTC, and GameStop, which recently invested $500 million into Bitcoin. South Korean entertainment conglomerate K Wave Media recently revealed plans to roll out a $500 million Bitcoin treasury strategy with the aim of expanding its K-pop related business, including music distribution and concert management. 3. Macroeconomic Tailwinds Global macroeconomic factors are also contributing to Bitcoin's bullish outlook. The U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policies have led to an expected 18% increase in the global M2 money supply in 2025, from $107 trillion to over $127 trillion. This monetary expansion, coupled with a weakening U.S. dollar, enhances Bitcoin's appeal as a store of value. Conclusion The decline in exchange-held Bitcoin reduces the immediate supply available for trading, potentially leading to decreased selling pressure. In economic terms, a lower supply amid steady or increasing demand can exert upward pressure on prices. With BTC reserves on exchanges hitting a 7-year low, it remains to be seen whether a supply shock will jumpstart the apex cryptocurrency to the next level as Bitcoin traverses the $105,216 level.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9497/bitcoin-on-exchanges-hits-7-year-low-supply-shock-looms,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

Is this a signal the market is bracing for something explosive? Table of Contents Bitcoin price reclaims $107,000 as political jitters fade BTC options data shows strong bullish lean into June expiry BTC breakout gains traction with support from options flows Bitcoin price reclaims $107,000 as political jitters fade Bitcoin ( BTC ) has quietly stabilized after a volatile week in which political headlines briefly disrupted market sentiment. The public dispute between U.S. President Donald Trump and Elon Musk pushed BTC toward the $100,000 mark, raising concerns about short-term confidence. The decline, however, proved temporary. Over the weekend, Bitcoin began to recover, and as of Jun. 9, it is trading around $107,800, up nearly 2% in the past 24 hours. BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news Institutional activity appears to be reinforcing the rebound. A growing list of companies is renewing interest in Bitcoin as a long-term treasury asset, drawing renewed attention to its role beyond trading. MicroStrategy has re-entered the spotlight with a new capital raise. The company is issuing $1 billion in perpetual preferred stock and plans to allocate part of the proceeds toward additional Bitcoin purchases. Metaplanet, which has been gradually building its BTC reserves over the past year, introduced a more ambitious target on Jun. 6. The firm now aims to accumulate 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027, expanding its original goal of 21,000 BTC by a factor of ten. These developments come amid ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. U.S. inflation data is due this week, beginning with the Consumer Price Index on Wednesday, followed by the Producer Price Index on Thursday. Traders are watching both releases for signals that could influence the Federal Reserve’s next policy move. The CME FedWatch Tool currently shows an over 99% probability that the Fed will maintain interest rates between 4.25% and 4.50% at its Jun. 17 meeting. Against this backdrop, let’s unpack what current BTC options data reveals about momentum and whether traders are preparing for more upside or bracing for a pullback. BTC options data shows strong bullish lean into June expiry The Jun. 27 Bitcoin options expiry on Deribit reflects one of the most tightly concentrated setups in recent months. Bitcoin options (June expiry) | Source: Deribit Total open interest stands at 123,528 contracts, composed of 77,077 calls and 46,451 puts, resulting in a put/call ratio of 0.60. The ratio suggests a continued bullish lean in positioning. The Max Pain level, where the most aggregate losses would be realized across both calls and puts, is located at $100,000. Above that level, bullish positioning becomes more visible. A significant spike in open interest appears at the $120,000 strike, indicating that many traders are eyeing it as a short-term upside target. One of the most notable data points is the surge in call open interest at $300,000. While strikes at $200,000 and $220,000 show some activity, the aggressive positioning at $300,000 stands out. This type of exposure is likely tied to tail-risk hedging or asymmetric upside protection, potentially by institutions or large spot holders. On the downside, the $85,000 strike holds the most concentrated open interest. While some protection is built between $60,000 and $90,000, the volume drops sharply below $85,000. If Bitcoin trades within the $95,000 to $105,000 range as expiry nears, many options buyers on both sides may face decay-related losses. The Jul. 25 expiry offers a more evenly distributed structure. Total open interest is lower at 40,267 contracts, with 25,109 calls and 15,158 puts. The put/call ratio remains at 0.60, indicating a similar bullish inclination, though with a more measured approach. Bitcoin options (July expiry) | Source: Deribit Call open interest is spread across key levels at $120,000, $130,000, $140,000, and $150,000, with relatively even distribution. Unlike the June expiry, there are no outsized bets far beyond current spot prices. The Max Pain for July is positioned at $104,000, slightly higher than June’s $100,000, suggesting a gradual upward shift in pricing expectations. Much of the July call exposure becomes meaningful only above $110,000. Unless BTC breaks through and holds above that level, a large portion of bullish open interest may remain inactive. On the put side, July mirrors much of the structure seen in June. The $85,000 strike continues to act as the key downside hedge, now joined by increased activity at $100,000. Below $70,000, put interest remains minimal, indicating that sharp downside moves are not being actively priced in. Overall, both the June and July expiries suggest a market tilted toward the upside, though with different expressions. June shows more aggressive exposure at the high end, particularly at $120,000 and $300,000, while July reflects a more technical and layered positioning framework. Bearish hedging remains limited in both cases, with $85,000 acting as the key zone of downside defense. The absence of deeper hedging under $70,000 suggests a low probability market view of capitulation. BTC breakout gains traction with support from options flows Bitcoin has reclaimed the $107,000 level, prompting analysts to assess whether the recent move marks the beginning of a broader breakout. The return above this zone is being read as a short-term structural shift following several days of tight, bearish price action. Analyst ali_charts pointed to the breakout above $106,600 and identified immediate upside targets at $108,300 and $110,000. Resistance broke, and #Bitcoin $BTC could reach $108,300 or even $110,000! https://t.co/NJQGfyD5mX pic.twitter.com/oVF0rccXlE — Ali (@ali_charts) June 9, 2025 According to his chart, BTC is currently positioned between the breakout level and the next key resistance area. Sustained movement through this band may allow the price to extend higher without requiring fresh catalysts. Michaël van de Poppe also emphasized the importance of the $106,500 support. In his latest analysis, holding above this area could attract increased interest from short-term traders and pressure short sellers to exit. I mentioned before that I'm looking at $106,500 for #Bitcoin to break. It's happening and it's showing strength. I've added some more context of when I'm expecting to see the acceleration. As long as we start staying above crucial levels, we'll start to see: – More buying… pic.twitter.com/scRtgpbjqJ — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) June 9, 2025 A move toward $108,900, he noted, may trigger faster price acceleration due to reactive trading behavior. These outlooks are supported by recent options data. Open interest in the Jun. 27 expiry remains heavily concentrated at the $120,000 call strike, reflecting a clear bullish bias. If Bitcoin begins closing above $110,000, those positions start gaining delta exposure. Traders, in response, may hedge through spot or perpetual contracts, mechanically contributing to upward price momentum. On the downside, bearish positioning appears limited. The $85,000 strike holds the most meaningful put volume, acting as a key hedge.. Whether BTC can hold above these levels through macro data releases this week will determine whether this setup evolves into a trend or resets into consolidation.

The US dollar, by comparison, has slumped and is the worst performer. Bitcoin remains a winning asset since President Trump’s tariff announcement on Apr. 2 - “Liberation Day,” as he called it. In relative and absolute terms vs. the world’s primary markets, the cryptocurrency is outperforming by a wide margin, based on a set of ETFs through Friday’s close (June 6). The US dollar, by comparison, has slumped and is the worst performer. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) is up roughly 20% since Apr. 2. That’s well ahead of the second-best performer – foreign stocks in developed markets ex-US (VEA), which has rallied 10%. Gold ( GLD ) is up roughly 6% while the US dollar ( UUP ) has shed more than 3% since the US rolled out a dramatic change in its tariff policy on Apr. 2. US stocks ( VTI ) are posting a moderate 6.2% increase post-“Liberation Day,” while a portfolio of medium-term US Treasuries ( IEF ) has slipped 1.2%. US and China officials are set to meet in London today to discuss disagreements linked to a preliminary agreement announced last month that has cooled trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. Expectations are low for a major breakthrough, although news that both sides are talking will be viewed as a positive for setting the tone in markets this week. The longer-term stakes, however, are high, and the outcome is highly uncertain. The US and China “are locked in an existential battle at the moment,” said Rebecca Harding, chief executive of the Centre for Economic Security, in a CNBC interview today. “It’s much, much more than just about trade and what’s going on in that domain between the two countries.

2025-06-09T13:38:25,"Kenya’s Crypto Tax Threatens Africa’s Digital Economy to Halt Before It Can Unify","The post Kenya’s Crypto Tax Threatens Africa’s Digital Economy to Halt Before It Can Unify appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As Kenya imposes a 1.5% tax on every crypto transaction, it threatens to disrupt Africa’s digital integration. It can also jeopardize the region’s fintech leadership, driving startups and talent abroad. The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) sees 54 nations as a unified market incorporating digital assets. But new rules and regulations in different African countries threaten this vision of unity. Kenya risks more than revenue with new crypto tax With a revised 1.5% crypto transactions tax, the nation risks losing regional fintech leadership, startup businesses overseas, and fracturing Africa’s digital economy, along with undermining its crypto revenue. It also pushes young African crypto users and tech enthusiasts to pursue unregulated platforms and informal channels. Many Kenyans, whose primary income is from trading cryptocurrency, are at risk of losing income. Freelancers who converted crypto into money to pay rent or school fees might lose their income. It also threatens content creators, developers, stakers, validators, and NFT artists who use cryptocurrency assets as daily payment roots. The National Assembly Committee on Finance and National Planning suggests a fourth point path for adequate crypto tax regulation in Kenya. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Tax in India Is Crushing Profits, Here’s How Bitcoin ETFs Can Save You , Key highlights of the National Assembly Committee regarding tax Tax efficiency: Digital assets should be treated under existing property disposal rules to avoid double taxation rather than the customized tax of 1.5%. This also eases the daily utility of crypto assets. Balancing innovation and regulation: Kenya should open itself to blockchain experimentation– from carbon credits to stablecoins. Privacy compliance: Public audits and cryptographic proofs should be integrated to ensure customer privacy. With this approach, the privacy of the investors will not be compromised. Phased rollout: The national assembly committee suggests that Kenya should prioritize education and voluntary compensation. It will assist in building capacity before fully enforced. What’s next? Upcoming bills under consideration Besides crypto tax, Kenya is also considering the Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) Bill 2025. The bill aims to strengthen existing regulations, such as anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT), along with reducing illicit financial flows. However, Kenya’s current draft framework lacks privacy-preserving mechanisms, risking citizen privacy. The bill has been questioned by parliament about the data privacy clause in the Finance Bill 2025. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-09T13:31:37,"Bitcoin above $100k could spark institutional altcoin rally: MEXC","Wall Street has now set its sights on altcoins, and inflows could follow if Bitcoin holds above a key level, says MEXC COO. Recent crypto IPOs and treasury announcements highlight growing institutional interest in Bitcoin (BTC) . This demand could soon extend to proven, low-volatility altcoins, according to Tracy Jin, COO of MEXC, who spoke with crypto.news. However, such a shift will largely depend on whether Bitcoin maintains strength above a critical threshold. “Capital markets are reopening to digital asset firms with credible models, while financial engineering — like Strategy’s hybrid fixed-income Bitcoin offering — signals a maturing appetite for low-volatility crypto returns. If momentum sustains and BTC holds above key thresholds, a broader institutional rotation into altcoins could follow,” Tracy Jin, MEXC. You might also like: Europe’s first Bitcoin Treasury firm plans to raise $340m to buy more BTC Traditional markets are actively driving crypto: Tracy Jin Jin pointed to several key developments as evidence of rising institutional interest in crypto. One standout example was Circle’s successful IPO . Gemini has also taken similar steps, while companies like Metaplanet are expanding their Bitcoin treasuries, including a planned $1 billion BTC acquisition. “All of these moves together point to a big change: crypto companies are no longer just reacting to market trends; they’re actually influencing how institutions can access crypto. As IPO calendars fill up and more money is being put into crypto through the stock market, it’s becoming a bigger part of traditional finance,” Tracy Jin, MEXC. You might also like: Trump, Musk feud; Circle IPO prices above range, Strategy upsizes offering | Weekly Recap According to Jin, this trend is likely to persist—at least in the near term. The key risk factor remains Bitcoin’s price. If BTC drops below the psychological $100,000 level, a temporary institutional pullback becomes more likely. As long as Bitcoin stays above $100,000 and big investors keep wanting it, more companies will probably go public with it, buy more of it, and get more money flowing into it — and not just into BTC but eventually into the whole altcoin market as well, as more people feel confident about cryptocurrency.

2025-06-09T13:30:11,"BTC Perpetual Futures: Unlocking Crucial Long Short Ratio Insights","BitcoinWorld BTC Perpetual Futures: Unlocking Crucial Long Short Ratio Insights Hey there, crypto traders and enthusiasts! Navigating the often wild waves of the cryptocurrency market, especially when it comes to derivatives like BTC perpetual futures , requires more than just watching price charts. Understanding the underlying market sentiment – who’s betting on the price going up (long) and who’s betting on it going down (short) – is absolutely crucial. That’s where the long short ratio comes into play. This little metric can offer a powerful glimpse into the collective mindset of traders across major exchanges. Are traders feeling bullish and piling into long positions, or is fear creeping in, leading to more short bets? Let’s dive into the latest crypto futures data and see what the 24-hour long-short ratios for BTC perpetual futures are telling us right now. Understanding the Long Short Ratio in Crypto Before we look at the numbers, let’s quickly break down what the long short ratio actually represents. In simple terms, it’s the ratio of the total number of long positions versus the total number of short positions currently open on a specific asset, like Bitcoin (BTC), on a given exchange or across multiple exchanges. A ratio above 1 indicates that there are more long positions than short positions. This suggests a generally bullish sentiment among traders. A ratio below 1 indicates that there are more short positions than long positions. This points towards a more bearish sentiment. A ratio close to 1 (or 50% Long / 50% Short) suggests a relatively neutral or undecided market sentiment. It’s a key indicator that many traders use to gauge the prevailing Bitcoin trading sentiment in the derivatives market. Latest Crypto Futures Data : What Does it Tell Us? Looking at the 24-hour data for BTC perpetual futures across several prominent exchanges, we can see a slight lean towards the long side, but overall, the market appears quite balanced. Here’s a snapshot of the long-short ratios: Exchange/Total Long Positions Short Positions Total (Across Measured Exchanges) 51.07% 48.93% Binance 52.10% 47.90% Bybit 50.01% 49.99% Gate.io 50.52% 49.48% As you can see from this crypto futures data , the total ratio sits just above 51% long. This suggests that, on aggregate over the past day, slightly more traders were positioned for a price increase than a decrease. However, being so close to 50/50 indicates a relatively neutral stance overall, or perhaps a market lacking strong conviction in either direction at this exact moment. Interpreting Bitcoin Trading Sentiment from the Ratio How should we interpret this specific long short ratio data in terms of Bitcoin trading sentiment ? The key takeaway is balance, with a minor bullish tilt. Here are a few points to consider: Slight Long Bias: The fact that longs slightly outweigh shorts suggests a marginal preference for upward price movement among futures traders. Lack of Extreme Conviction: A ratio significantly skewed (e.g., 60%+ long or short) would indicate strong sentiment. The current numbers, being so close to 50/50, suggest the market is somewhat indecisive or waiting for a clearer signal. Exchange Variations: While the total is balanced, Binance shows a slightly stronger long bias compared to Bybit, which is almost perfectly balanced. These minor differences can sometimes reflect the dominant trading styles or demographics on different platforms. It’s important to remember that this ratio reflects *open positions*, not necessarily the volume or strength behind those positions. A few large ‘whale’ traders could potentially skew the ratio without representing the broader market sentiment accurately. Using the Ratio in Your Perpetual Futures Trading Strategy So, how can you use this long short ratio information in your own perpetual futures trading ? Think of it as one tool in your analytical toolbox, not the only one. Here are some actionable insights: Sentiment Confirmation: If you are considering a long trade based on other technical or fundamental analysis, a slightly long-biased ratio like this could offer minor confirmation of your view, suggesting you’re trading with the slight prevailing wind. Contrarian Indicator? Sometimes, extreme long or short ratios can be seen as a contrarian signal. If everyone is heavily long, who is left to buy to push the price higher? This current ratio isn’t extreme enough for a strong contrarian signal, but it’s a concept to keep in mind for future data points. Liquidation Risks: While not directly shown here, extreme ratios can build up ‘liquidity pools’ where a large number of stops or liquidations are clustered. A sudden move against the dominant side can trigger these, leading to cascading liquidations and rapid price swings. Monitoring ratios over time can give clues about where these clusters might be forming. Combine with Other Data: Never rely solely on the long-short ratio. Use it in conjunction with price action, volume analysis, funding rates (another key futures metric), and broader market news. Successful perpetual futures trading involves synthesizing multiple data points to form a complete picture. Beyond the Numbers: Limitations of the BTC Perpetual Futures Ratio While valuable, the long short ratio for BTC perpetual futures does have limitations: Lagging Indicator: The ratio reflects positions already taken. It doesn’t predict future entries or exits. Whale Influence: A few large positions can significantly impact the ratio, potentially masking the sentiment of smaller traders. Not Exchange-Inclusive: The ‘Total’ ratio is usually an aggregate of *some* major exchanges, but not necessarily *all* of them. Context is Key: A 51/49 ratio might mean different things depending on whether Bitcoin is trending strongly, ranging, or at a critical support/resistance level. Treat the ratio as a temperature check on market sentiment, not a definitive buy or sell signal. In Conclusion: What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Trading Sentiment Now? The latest 24-hour crypto futures data for BTC perpetual futures shows a market poised near equilibrium, with just a slight edge to the bulls based on the long short ratio . This suggests a period of relative indecision or consolidation among futures traders. While the sentiment isn’t overwhelmingly bullish or bearish, the slight lean towards long positions indicates that, on balance, more traders are betting on continued upward momentum or at least defending current price levels. For those engaged in perpetual futures trading , keeping an eye on how this ratio evolves, especially in response to price movements and news, can provide valuable context. Will the long bias strengthen, indicating growing confidence? Or will shorts start to increase, signaling potential downside pressure? Time, and continued data analysis, will tell.

2025-06-09T13:28:38,"Bitcoin, Ethereum & XRP Price Prediction This Week: Will CPI Data Trigger a Crypto Crash?","The post Bitcoin, Ethereum & XRP Price Prediction This Week: Will CPI Data Trigger a Crypto Crash? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The broader cryptocurrency market is on a rising spree over the last three days due to several optimistic factors, including positive US jobs report and a fresh restart of trade talks between the US and China. This has created a recovery path from the Thursday flash crash. However, this optimism is forecasted to have a short life, as the big shot cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple’s XRP are at a grave risk this week that could display similar movements like Thursday, June 5th. These outcomes are forecasted as the US-China trade talks on Monday in London, which is seen as a highly volatile catalyst, with the potential to cause sharp movements. Another most critical factor to watch is Wednesday’s CPI data , which is crucial for market sentiment. A Bloomberg survey suggests that inflation likely spiked in May due to tariffs. If the report shows a higher-than-expected number, it could trigger a bearish move, dampening crypto market sentiment by indicating a slowdown in consumer spending. Conversely, if the CPI comes in lower than expected, it could lead to significant gains for top cryptocurrencies and altcoins. Is $112K Coming In Bitcoin Price This Week? The Bitcoin price is exchanging hands at $107663, and it is recovering after it took support from the dynamic 50-day EMA band. It has broken the short-term declining trendline and is headed straight for the $112K mark. If the momentum continues and upcoming US CPI reports join in favour, then an ATH could be on its plate. Many experts are hoping for inflation to print soft, as the ongoing momentum looks strong and seems Bitcoin is not done yet. However, the platform Truflation highlights that inflation may be picking up, as in May it began with 1.35% and by month end it was 2.06%. If CPI prints similar to what the data’s are projecting, then the ongoing momentum could be short-lived and could risk falling around $100K or even to $95K. Additionally, on-chain data revealed a concerning trend: the Small wallets, holding up to 1 BTC, have been accumulating strongly. Historically, when the “small fish” holders buy with conviction, it often hints that whales could be preparing to sell into that liquidity. This retail fomo is considered by many as a fatal warning sign that a sell-off could be on its way. How XRP And ETH are Expected To Perform This Week? In the last three days, the Bitcoin price advancement has boosted altcoin’s prices too. Even XRP and Ethereum have risen 8% and 6% respectively. However, the gains are not enough to clear their bounded range; the XRP and ETH prices are facing key hurdles. If the CPI comes higher, then a fall in both altcoin prices seems likely, but if CPI comes soft then it could be a short-term catalyst to clear their nearest hurdles. If XRP price manages to rise, then $2.65 is this week’s target, and for Ethereum price , it is at $3066. On the downside, XRP could fall to $1.80, and ETH towards $2000, respectively. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-09T13:24:12,"CoinW Research: Navigating Value and Risk in the Blockchain Era","BitcoinWorld CoinW Research: Navigating Value and Risk in the Blockchain Era HONG KONG, June 9, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — In the fast-evolving cryptocurrency landscape, identifying high-quality assets while steering clear of hype-driven investments is a critical challenge for both investors and exchanges. As a key player in the industry, CoinW Research stands at the forefront of this task, committed to independence, integrity, and analytical rigor. With a data-driven and rational approach, it filters market noise, uncovers long-term value, and strengthens risk management frameworks. Serving as the core team for asset review and sector research, CoinW Research merges data science with industry expertise to offer insightful evaluations. Its work not only supports the platform’s sustainable development but also promotes the health of the broader blockchain ecosystem. Anchoring Value In a Shifting Market The early days of blockchain revolved around foundational innovations like Bitcoin and Ethereum—decentralized money and programmable smart contracts. Since its establishment in 2020, CoinW Research has witnessed the market’s transformation from speculative “aircoin” phases to a new era emphasizing fundamental value. Prior to the DeFi wave, the market was heavily influenced by ICOs, many of which prioritized hype over substance. This speculative bubble eventually gave way to the rise of DeFi—introducing practical financial utilities with transparency, composability, and real returns. CoinW Research emerged early as a value-oriented evaluator, developing its proprietary SCORE model—a comprehensive asset evaluation system that blends quantitative metrics with in-depth sectoral research. The model has become a benchmark for identifying quality assets. Its methodology evaluates factors like token distribution, vesting policies, and governance models. For example, the Institute’s recommendation of MYRO, a Solana-based meme coin, was based on its equitable tokenomics and active community. Its successful platform launch validated the Institute’s rigorous review process. The prevailing industry consensus is clear: sustainable blockchain growth hinges on technological innovation, not speculation. CoinW Research is committed to identifying enduring value and serving as a rational voice in a volatile market. The SCORE Model: A Holistic Approach to Asset Evaluation Built on principles of fairness, transparency, and deep market insight, the SCORE model assesses crypto assets across five key dimensions: Sector & Hype: Tracks market trends while filtering irrational speculation. Code & Security: Enforces strict security through smart contract audits and code transparency. Operations & Outreach: Evaluates project fundamentals such as economic models, marketing strategies, user growth, and community engagement to determine sustainability and market vitality. Resources & Teams: Assesses the experience and network strength of the project team as dual indicators of reliability. Evaluation & Data: Leverages on-chain analytics to reveal a project’s real value and activity. More than just a rating framework, SCORE embodies CoinW Research’s philosophy: identify real innovation, manage risk rigorously, and simplify decision-making for users and exchanges alike. From Strategy to Impact: Practical Success Stories SCORE is not theoretical—it delivers measurable outcomes. By leveraging this model, CoinW Research identifies promising opportunities ahead of the curve and shields users from high-risk or non-compliant projects. In 2020, CoinW Research analyzed early capital flows during the DeFi boom and listed top projects like YFI and YFII before they went mainstream—allowing users to ride the liquidity mining trend early. This proactive approach showcases the model’s predictive power and the Institute’s strategic foresight. Such results demonstrate CoinW Research’s value not just as an analytical team but as a market authority capable of guiding both users and platforms through complex industry cycles. Staying Ahead: Insight, Independence, and Execution Over years of experience, CoinW Research has adhered to four core principles: user-first thinking, independent judgment, industry foresight, and strategic execution. It acts as both a rigorous filter for listings and a benchmark in the Web3 space. When Sushiswap launched its now-famous “liquidity attack” on Uniswap in 2020, the Institute provided timely on-chain analysis, enabling CoinW to become one of the first exchanges to list SUSHI—reinforcing its leadership in data-informed decision-making. As DeFi evolved, CoinW Research deepened its technical research to help users identify sustainable, long-term opportunities. Navigating Hype: Caution During the BRC-20 Frenzy The BRC-20 boom in 2023 marked another speculative phase in the crypto market, as the Ordinals protocol introduced a novel way to inscribe data onto individual satoshis—creating a wave of inscription-based tokens on the Bitcoin network. As hype escalated and a flood of projects emerged, CoinW Research Institute maintained its disciplined approach. Upholding rigorous standards, the Institute approved only two projects—Ordi and SATS—after comprehensive security audits. This caution proved effective: SATS’s market cap skyrocketed from $10 million to over $2 billion, exemplifying the power of quality-over-quantity asset selection. By filtering out short-term noise and focusing on fundamentals, CoinW Research helps users navigate volatile markets—mitigating the 99% of risks to uncover the 1% of truly valuable opportunities. Decoding Meme Trends In 2024, CoinW identified early momentum within the Solana ecosystem, strategically backing meme coins like BOME and SLERF—which ultimately delivered outsized returns. While the broader market dismissed Pump.fun as a “junk coin factory,” CoinW Research recognized the underlying innovation in its auto-launch and burn mechanisms. Projects like MOODENG, which leveraged this infrastructure, gained early support from the Institute. This contrarian insight reflects CoinW Research’s willingness to challenge popular narratives and uncover value in unconventional places. The Rise of Decentralized AI and Infrastructure Partnerships In parallel, CoinW Research prioritized the rapidly emerging AI sector, listing projects like ARC and Virtual, which leverage AI to boost blockchain performance. CoinW Research anticipates that future breakthroughs—akin to Uniswap’s impact—may arise from decentralized AI protocols. Supporting public infrastructure also remains a priority. The Institute played a key role in launching Shardeum globally and formed strategic alliances with Solana to revitalize its ecosystem, reinforcing its commitment to long-term value creation. Its team—bringing together Web3 innovation and traditional finance experience—continues to transform conviction into disciplined research and strategic action. Finding Certainty Amid Market Uncertainty Over the past five years, CoinW Research Institute has consistently followed the principles of user focus, independence, industry insight, and future planning. It neither blindly chases trends nor remains complacent. Its success is rooted in a methodology that deeply integrates industry knowledge, data science, and risk management. In a noisy and chaotic market, truth lies in on-chain data and long-term trends. CoinW Research continues to illuminate the path to value discovery in cryptocurrency with clear-headed rationality.

2025-06-09T13:19:42,"Strategy announces 1,054 BTC purchase; price per Bitcoin now over $70K","Strategy bought another 1,054 BTC, extending the trend of relatively small, sustained purchases. The average price for the firm’s holdings is now $70,086, after several weeks of buying above $100,000. Strategy announced its latest weekly round of BTC purchases, this time adding 1,054 BTC. The last two weeks added under 2,000 BTC to the company’s treasury, raising the average purchase price to $70,086. In total, the Saylor-led firm also spent over $40B to date, while still seeking financing to add more BTC. Strategy has acquired 1,045 BTC for ~$110.2 million at ~$105,426 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 17.1% YTD 2025. As of 6/8/2025, we hodl 582,000 $BTC acquired for ~$40.79 billion at ~$70,086 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF $STRD https://t.co/blyWfRskjE — Strategy (@Strategy) June 9, 2025 The weekly purchases are not tied to specific BTC dips and often lead to price expansion. However, the size of purchases corresponds to the sale of one or more types of Strategy stock . The latest purchase follows the placement of $62.7M in STRK and $43.3M in STRF shares. No new MSTR shares were registered, per the latest filing . Strategy raised $112M per its latest filing, with no new MSTR common stock sold, avoiding the dilution of BTC per share. | Source: Strategy filings Since no new MSTR common stock was sold in the latest round, Strategy is still a leader by a factor of 10 when it comes to BTC per share. The company holds 0.02 BTC per share, though not all stock buyers have a claim on the treasury in the case of emergency compensation. From June 10 onward, Strategy will launch the sale of STRD , a new type of high-risk perpetual stock with a non-mandatory 10% dividend. The new shares are riskier in terms of returns and compensation, but may boost the sales of STRF and STRK. Strategy still inspires other BTC buyers Strategy continues to influence other companies, starting even with minimal BTC purchases. Only 26 other corporate holders have more than 1,000 BTC in their treasuries, with most of them retaining legacy holdings. Just seven entities hold more than 10,000 BTC, despite the on-chain evidence of close to 2,000 top whale wallets with even bigger holdings. In the past week, five other companies bought more BTC, while also using the purchase announcement to boost their social media presence. Already, 124 public companies have announced some form of BTC treasury, with even more setting up expectations of future purchases. Even with the relatively slow purchases, large-scale entities already hold 3.4M BTC, which by all indications will remain off the market. The corporate purchases, miner holdings and no more sales from government wallets also diminish the amount of easily available BTC. The latest data shows OTC desks only hold 123.5K BTC, down from 236K about a month ago. OTC desks are key for supplying ETFs, as well as potential corporate buyers. Coinbase Prime retains 63,537 BTC for sale, in addition to a falling balance on exchanges. Ahead of the latest Strategy announcement, BTC also rallied above $107,000 within an hour. The leading coin traded at $107,975, rising above the latest purchase price. MSTR recovered to $374.47, partially compensating for the fall of Tesla (TSLA).

2025-06-09T13:18:55,"Saylor Mocks Quantum Threat as a Scheme to Sell Tokens","Speaking on CNBC, Saylor said major tech companies like Google or Microsoft would never unleash quantum technology recklessly, as it would endanger the global digital infrastructure, including their own businesses. He added that Bitcoin is capable of upgrading its cryptographic systems if the need arises. While research firm Project Eleven warns millions of Bitcoin could be vulnerable if quantum computing advances, current machines are far from meeting the required qubit threshold. Meanwhile, Saylor continues his bullish stance, and recently teased Strategy’s ninth straight week of Bitcoin accumulation. The announcement was made after a $75 million BTC purchase and a $1 billion preferred stock offering to fund even more buys. Similarly, Europe’s Blockchain Group is planning to raise $342 million to grow its BTC treasury. Quantum Threat to Bitcoin Is Just Marketing Hype? Bitcoin bull and Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor dismissed the growing concerns about quantum computing’s potential threat to Bitcoin, and labeled it a marketing tactic that is designed to promote quantum-themed tokens. In a June 6 appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” Saylor stated bluntly that fears surrounding quantum computing’s ability to break Bitcoin’s cryptographic defenses are overblown and largely propagated by those who want to profit off hype. “It’s mainly marketing from people that want to sell you the next quantum yo-yo token,” he said. The crypto community has long speculated about whether future advances in quantum computing could undermine Bitcoin’s security by cracking its elliptic curve cryptography ( ECC ). Quantum research firm Project Eleven even warned that more than 10 million Bitcoin addresses with exposed public keys—and potentially over 6 million BTC—could be vulnerable if such computing power becomes a reality. Still, Saylor insists that if quantum computing ever evolves to the point of being a genuine threat, it wouldn’t be used recklessly. He argued that technology giants like Google or Microsoft will never release such a machine, as doing so could destabilize the global digital infrastructure, including their own businesses and even the US government. “Google and Microsoft aren’t going to sell you a computer that cracks modern cryptography,” he said, mainly due to the widespread damage that would ensue. In the hypothetical scenario where quantum machines do pose a real risk, Saylor believes the Bitcoin network will adapt, just as any modern digital system does. He also explained that Bitcoin’s open-source infrastructure allows for software and hardware upgrades, much like updates seen regularly across Microsoft, Google, and government systems. For now, quantum hardware is still far from capable of breaking Bitcoin’s ECC. Project Eleven estimates that roughly 2,000 error-corrected, or “logical,” qubits will be needed to crack a 256-bit Bitcoin key. IBM’s Heron chip and Google’s Willow currently only support 156 and 105 qubits respectively. Despite this, Project Eleven recently launched a “Q-Day Prize” competition to test how close the quantum threat really is. For now, Saylor believes that the bigger risk to Bitcoin holders is not quantum computing but phishing attacks. Strategy Nears Ninth Straight Week of Bitcoin Buys Michael Saylor’s confidence in Bitcoin is still very clear as he once again stirred speculation in the Bitcoin community after posting “Send more Orange” on X, alongside a chart of the company’s Bitcoin holdings. Saylor’s June 8 post led many to believe that yet another BTC purchase may be imminent. If confirmed, it will be the ninth consecutive week of Bitcoin accumulation by Strategy. The post was made after the company’s recent purchase of 705 BTC between May 26 and June 1, at an average price of $106,495 per coin. This $75 million acquisition pushed the firm’s total Bitcoin holdings to 580,955 BTC, which is valued at roughly $61.4 billion. According to data from SaylorTracker , the company has seen a return of approximately 50% on its investment. In tandem with the social media post, Strategy announced an expansion of its capital-raising efforts through a $1 billion stock offering . This move upsizes the previously announced $250 million raise. The company plans to sell 11.76 million shares of its 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock at $85 per share, with anticipated net proceeds of around $979 million after deducting underwriting and other associated costs. The preferred stock carries non-cumulative 10% dividends, and is designed to attract institutional and professional investors who are looking for yield while also making it possible for Strategy to expand its Bitcoin treasury. Strategy cemented itself as the largest known holder of Bitcoin globally, with more BTC in its possession than the United States and China combined. Its massive holdings are nearly twelve times bigger than those of the next-largest holder, Bitcoin miner Mara Holdings. As a result, many investors now vsee Strategy as a de facto Bitcoin holding company, serving as a proxy for institutional exposure to the cryptocurrency. Top Bitcoin holders (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) Blockchain Group Pushes Bitcoin Bet Paris-based cryptocurrency firm The Blockchain Group also has high expectations for Bitcoin, and announced plans to raise more than $340 million to expand its Bitcoin treasury. According to a June 10 news release , the company is seeking to raise 300 million euros, or approximately $342 million, by using a structure inspired by the US-style “At the Market” (ATM) offering. This model allows shares to be sold under market conditions set by a counterpart in a pre-agreed volume framework. The capital raise will take place in tranches, with pricing determined by the higher of either the previous day's closing price or the volume-weighted average price, capped at 21% of that day’s trading volume. This announcement was made after the company’s recent acquisition of $68 million worth of Bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 1,471 BTC. The Blockchain Group is Europe’s first dedicated Bitcoin treasury company, and appears to be following the footsteps of major US players like Michael Saylor’s Strategy. With more than $61 billion in Bitcoin on its balance sheet, Strategy holds about 2.76% of the total circulating BTC supply. These large-scale treasury allocations are playing an increasingly central role in sustaining Bitcoin’s long-term bullish narrative, even as the asset consolidates after its record high of $112,000 that was reached on May 22. According to Nexo’s Stella Zlatareva , institutional purchases and infrastructure investment are strong signals of enduring confidence, despite the recent short-term volatility. Bitcoin’s recent bounce from the $103,000 support level further proves that there is market resilience, with no widespread signs of forced selling or deleveraging.

2025-06-09T13:18:55,"Crypto Community Shocked as Neo Pepe $NEOP Challenges Bitcoin Pepe, Solaxy with Unmatched Innovation","The post Crypto Community Shocked as Neo Pepe $NEOP Challenges Bitcoin Pepe, Solaxy with Unmatched Innovation appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Neo Pepe’s Groundbreaking Launch Crypto analysts and investors are in a frenzy following the sensational June 2025 launch of Neo Pepe ($NEOP), a revolutionary project rapidly reshaping the cryptocurrency presale landscape. Positioned as a formidable competitor to prominent presale projects like Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) and Solaxy (SOLX), Neo Pepe’s combination of cutting-edge tokenomics, innovative liquidity mechanisms, and visionary community governance has triggered intense debate and curiosity throughout the crypto community. Could Neo Pepe be exactly the innovation investors have long sought? Advanced Tokenomics At the heart of Neo Pepe’s rapid ascent is its carefully structured 16-phase presale model, starting at a remarkably accessible $0.05 per token and incrementally climbing to $0.16 in the final phase. Unlike typical presales, Neo Pepe strategically locks tokens until the official launch, after which they unlock hourly in proportion to their presale phase. This ingenious token-release schedule dramatically reduces the volatility commonly associated with newly launched tokens. In comparison, presale projects such as Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) and Solaxy (SOLX), while popular, have yet to implement similar depth in their token-release strategies. Industry analysts have begun debating vigorously—does Neo Pepe’s sophisticated model set a transformative new benchmark for presale economics? Comparison of Neo Pepe ($NEOP) vs. Solaxy (SOLX) Feature Neo Pepe ($NEOP) Solaxy (SOLX) Tokenomics 16-phase incremental presale model to reduce volatility Basic token release without advanced phased approach Liquidity Mechanism 2.5% auto-allocation with immediate token burning for stability No comparable liquidity strategy Governance Structure Advanced decentralized governance (Governor contracts, multisig treasuries, Zodiac modules) Minimal governance involvement Price Stability Hourly token unlocking schedule post-launch to ensure gradual stability No structured approach to price stabilization Innovation & Vision Combines economics, governance, and liquidity innovation to redefine presale standards Primarily relies on general blockchain claims without detailed structural advancements Auto-Liquidity Innovation Neo Pepe further differentiates itself with an advanced liquidity mechanism unlike anything the presale market has seen. With each transaction, Neo Pepe automatically allocates 2.5% toward liquidity pools, immediately burning these liquidity tokens. This cutting-edge design ensures continual market stability, actively reducing volatility risks and securing long-term investor confidence. This distinct approach contrasts sharply with competing presale projects like Solaxy (SOLX) and Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP), which have yet to incorporate comparable liquidity innovations. Crypto experts are openly speculating whether Neo Pepe’s pioneering liquidity solution might compel competitors to adopt similar models, potentially reshaping presale project standards across the crypto industry. Governance Raises Investor Expectations Perhaps the most captivating feature driving investor enthusiasm around Neo Pepe is its sophisticated decentralized governance structure. Powered by advanced infrastructure—including Governor contracts, TimelockControllers, and multisignature treasury management with Zodiac Module integration—Neo Pepe empowers investors to actively influence critical project decisions, such as exchange listings and strategic initiatives. While presale projects like Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) and Solaxy (SOLX) focus primarily on meme-driven marketing or speculative appeal, Neo Pepe firmly emphasizes meaningful investor involvement and transparent governance. The broader crypto community now eagerly questions whether Neo Pepe’s commitment to genuine investor empowerment will redefine expectations for presale governance across the entire crypto ecosystem. Neo Pepe vs. Bitcoin Pepe, Solaxy By directly contrasting Neo Pepe’s revolutionary presale model with popular presale competitors Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) and Solaxy (SOLX), crypto analysts have quickly noted critical differences. Bitcoin Pepe leans heavily into the familiarity of Bitcoin’s brand appeal combined with meme-centric marketing, whereas Solaxy positions itself as an innovative blockchain platform yet lacks the sophisticated economic and governance structures Neo Pepe presents. These direct comparisons have sparked intense investor curiosity and vibrant community dialogue. Industry forums actively debate whether Neo Pepe’s superior structural integrity and innovative features will reshape investor expectations and force other presale coins to evolve accordingly. The powerful combination of advanced tokenomics, revolutionary liquidity strategies, and investor-centric governance positions Neo Pepe distinctly ahead of competitors in the presale landscape. Investors and industry experts alike are deeply intrigued, sparking broad discussion on whether Neo Pepe signals a transformative turning point for crypto presales, fundamentally changing the industry’s approach to token launches. How does Neo Pepe’s presale model reduce volatility?. Neo Pepe employs a unique 16-phase presale with tokens gradually unlocking hourly post-launch. This controlled approach significantly minimizes sudden price fluctuations often seen in typical presale launches. What makes Neo Pepe’s liquidity mechanism innovative? Neo Pepe automatically dedicates 2.5% of every transaction to liquidity pools, immediately burning these tokens. This innovative process maintains steady market stability and investor confidence long-term. How can investors actively participate in Neo Pepe’s governance? Neo Pepe leverages advanced decentralized governance systems, including multisignature treasury management and Zodiac Module integration, empowering token holders to directly influence strategic decisions, such as exchange listings and project developments. The crypto community now keenly debates whether Neo Pepe’s unique structure represents the future of sustainable and investor-friendly blockchain presales.

2025-06-09T13:15:10,"XRP and Solana Added to Nasdaq Crypto Index: Market Expansion Imminent?","The Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index (NCIUS) was updated on June 2 to include four new cryptocurrencies: Solana ($SOL), Cardano ($ADA), Stellar ($XLM), and XRP ($XRP). Earlier, it had only included $BTC and $ETH. While this is great news for the development of the broader crypto market, it ‘s caused an issue for the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF (NCIQ). This ETF tracks the NCIUS index to provide weighted exposure in $ETH and $BTC. Until now, it could replicate the index with precision and minimum divergence. However, even though the composition of NCIUS has now changed, the ETF isn’t permitted to track any assets other than Bitcoin and Ethereum. This has caused a mismatch between the fund’s objective and the index it is tracking. NASDAQ has submitted a proposal to let NCIQ track the Nasdaq Crypto Index (NCI) instead of the current NCIUS. The NCI index also includes $SOL, $ADA, $XLM, and $XRP, as well as $LINK, $LTC, and $UNI. The SEC is expected to respond by November 2, 2025. In any case, there’s no denying Wall Street is now adopting a more inclusive approach to crypto, looking at assets other than Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin is a Great Buy Even at $106K In other pro-crypto developments, John Deaton, an ace Bitcoin investor and XRP supporter, took to X to voice his analysis that $BTC ‘s a safer buy at $106K than it was at $20K.’ He believes that the risk-to-reward ratio is more favorable now than when Bitcoin was trading much lower. Deaton also said that the current macroeconomic conditions will gradually undermine people’s confidence in fiat currencies. For example, growing national debt and exorbitant tariffs are big red flags for the cash economy. In such a scenario, ‘digital gold’ emerges as a clear alternative. First, $BTC’s supply is limited, so corporations and governments can’t manipulate it. Secondly, companies and countries, both large and small, are racing to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets, pushing up the price. Michael Saylor’s Strategy, for instance, now owns more than 580K $BTC, and 16 firms added it to their balance sheets just last week. Governments across the board, like Ireland, Pakistan, and Ukraine, are considering creating their own Bitcoin reserves after the US announced it would pursue one. All these signals show that Bitcoin is here to stay and only goes from strength to strength. If you, too, are keen on milking $BTC to the last possible drop, we’d like to introduce you to BTC Bull Token . What Is BTC Bull Token? BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) has taken a simple idea – to cheer on the greatest digital asset, Bitcoin – and transformed it into one of the best meme coins on the market right now. With a muscular bull as its mascot and a website theme that mimics Bitcoin’s bright gold color, BTC Bull Token wears its Bitcoin bullish badge with pride. According to its whitepaper , it’s ‘the unstoppable force pushing Bitcoin towards $1M+.’ It does this by being the ONLY crypto today offering free (and completely legitimate) $BTC to its token holders. Every time Bitcoin claims a new major milestone, like $150K and $200K, $BTCBULL holders who have stored their tokens in Best Wallet will stand a chance to earn real Bitcoins. Note: the $BTC amount you receive will depend on the number of $BTCBULL tokens you bought in the Community Sale. Also, subscribe to BTC Bull Token’s social media ( X and Telegram ) for updates about the airdrop events, as you’ll have to opt in to qualify. Burn Tokens, Create Hype, and Enjoy Profits The developers have done everything to ensure the project’s success, including using a deflationary approach, also known as a token burn mechanism, which sees the project shaving off a part of the total token supply to push the price. These ‘token burn’ events will take place every time Bitcoin’s price increases by $50K, starting from $125K. Incentives like these, combined with a chunky 40% of the total supply reserved for PR and marketing, suggest BTC Bull Token could become one of the top trending cryptos after its launch. $BTCBULL Is Currently Cheaper than It Will Ever Be Hell-bent on backing Bitcoin to $1M and beyond? Get BTC Bull Token ! According to our research, $BTCBULL can surge past $0.0497 by 2030 – a mind-boggling rise of over 1,800% in less than five years. That’s aside from the chance to win real $BTC (currently worth over $105K) if you’re a $BTCBULL owner. The good news is the token is still in presale, meaning you can grab it for just $0.002555. The project has already raised around $7M in early investor funding and is raring to go once it launches. You can read all about it in our What is BTC Bull Token guide. More Cryptos Go Mainstream, but $BTC Remains the Greatest New ETFs supporting modern cryptocurrencies like Solana and XRP represent a healthy diversification in the market, but the fact remains, there’s only one Bitcoin. With an innovative approach towards airdrops, a classic token burn mechanism, and a lively community of crypto degens, BTC Bull Token nevertheless could emerge as the next big crypto coin to follow in Bitcoin’s footsteps. That said, make sure to do your own research before investing.

2025-06-09T13:13:34,"Major Announcement Concerning All Shiba Inu (SHIB) Users: Details","TL;DR Precision liquidity pools, multi-source staking rewards, and real-time on-chain token burns are among the new features of Shibarium. The protocol’s advancements are seen as vital for Shiba Inu’s ecosystem growth, with some experts suggesting it could reignite SHIB’s rally if adoption improves. The ‘Total Upgrade’ LUCIE, the pseudonymous marketing strategist of Shibarium, took it to X to disclose the latest improvements surrounding the layer-2 scaling solution. “This isn’t a cosmetic refresh. It’s a total upgrade to the engine that powers how you earn, trade, and burn inside the ecosystem,” the disclosure starts. Specifically, LUCIE explained that precision liquidity pools are live following the development. Liquidity providers can now choose exactly where to provide liquidity and target specific zones. The X user also revealed that individuals who stake tokens are enabled to earn from multiple sources simultaneously. “It’s compounding without the micromanagement. Keep it up all in one spot and let the rewards stack up,” they added. Perhaps the biggest improvement after the upgrade is related to the burning program. LUCIE unveiled that users will no longer need to wait for announcements to burn tokens as they will happen on-chain , in real-time. Subsequently, Shibarium’s lead said all major tools now run together “smoothly,” sharing five valuable tips for “real users:” “Lock LPs into price ranges for better APY. Combine rewards across protocols. Exit and re-enter LP zones without losing gains. Burn as you go. Stay agile when the market moves.” Shibarium’s Revival Shiba Inu’s layer-2 blockchain solution plays a vital role in Shiba Inu’s overall ecosystem growth. It officially came into existence in August 2023, aiming to reduce transaction costs, improve speed, and enhance scalability. Shibarium’s advancement is touted by some industry participants as a main factor that could give SHIB a boost for a renewed rally. Not long ago, the Bitcoin advocate Jeremie Davinci said: “I like Shiba Inu, as you know, and I think it will do relatively well in this cycle, but it may not go as high as you expect. I think Shiba Inu has a lot of utility now that they have Shibarium, and basically , it’s a chain that you can actually run all kinds of applications. However, nobody is using it, and there are no applications for using your tokens on Shibarium yet . If they get that solved, Shiba Inu will go to the moon.” Towards the end of May, the number of daily transactions processed on the protocol sharply collapsed . Nonetheless, over the weekend, there was a significant resurgence , and the figure is back in the millions.

2025-06-09T13:10:48,"Bitcoin Trading Volume Hits Shocking Low: What This Means for BTC Price and the Market","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Trading Volume Hits Shocking Low: What This Means for BTC Price and the Market Hey crypto enthusiasts! Have you noticed things feeling a bit… quiet in the Bitcoin trading world lately? Well, you’re not imagining it. A significant development has emerged from the data, showing that spot Bitcoin trading volume on centralized exchanges (CEXs) has plummeted to levels not seen in years. This isn’t just a minor dip; it’s a return to activity levels last observed way back in October 2020. Spot BTC Trading Volume Hits a Multi-Year Low According to analysis shared by crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr., the daily spot spot BTC trading activity on major centralized platforms recently dropped to a mere $965.6 million. To put that into perspective, this figure represents the lowest point since October 2020. This specific data point highlights a considerable slowdown in the immediate buying and selling of Bitcoin on the platforms where most retail and institutional spot trading typically occurs. Why is this data point so important? Trading volume is often seen as a health indicator for a market. High volume typically suggests strong interest and participation, while low volume can indicate a lack of conviction, uncertainty, or simply that participants are choosing to do something other than actively trade. The return to 2020 levels is particularly noteworthy because the crypto market, and Bitcoin specifically, has seen massive growth, adoption, and price appreciation since that time. For volume to regress to that point suggests a fundamental shift in current market behavior. Understanding the Dynamics Behind Low Bitcoin Trading Volume So, what exactly is causing this significant drop in Bitcoin trading volume ? Several factors could be contributing to this phenomenon: The ‘HODLing’ Mentality: One of the most widely cited reasons, and supported by the initial analysis, is that investors are simply choosing to hold onto their Bitcoin rather than trade it. The term ‘HODL’ (Hold On for Dear Life) is practically a mantra in the crypto community, especially during accumulation phases or in anticipation of future price increases or events like the Bitcoin halving. Lack of Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price has, at times, entered periods of consolidation or relatively low volatility following major moves. Low volatility can reduce trading opportunities for short-term traders and scalpers, leading to decreased volume. If the price isn’t moving much, there’s less incentive for active trading. Shift to Other Market Segments: While the data specifically points to spot trading on CEXs, some trading activity might be shifting to other areas, such as derivatives markets (futures, options) or decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. However, spot volume on major CEXs remains a crucial metric for overall market health. Market Fatigue or Uncertainty: Following periods of significant price swings or macroeconomic uncertainty, some market participants might simply step back and wait on the sidelines, reducing overall activity. Accumulation Phase: Low volume during a price consolidation period can sometimes indicate an accumulation phase, where larger players are slowly buying up supply without causing significant price spikes, waiting for the right moment for a markup. Implications for BTC Price and Crypto Market Trends The drop in spot BTC trading volume isn’t just a statistic; it has potential implications for the BTC price and broader crypto market trends . Historically, periods of low volume have sometimes preceded periods of increased volatility. When volume is low, a relatively small amount of buying or selling pressure can have a larger impact on price than it would in a high-volume environment. This means the market could be coiled, potentially awaiting a catalyst for a significant move in either direction. For those interested in Bitcoin analysis , low volume during a consolidation phase following a price increase is often interpreted as a sign that holders are strong and not selling into the minor dips. Conversely, low volume during a price decrease might suggest that selling pressure isn’t strong, but neither is buying interest picking up significantly yet. Benefits of a Low Volume Environment (from a HODLer perspective): May indicate strong holder conviction, suggesting potential for future price appreciation if demand returns. Can represent an accumulation phase for informed investors. Less noise and fewer impulsive trading decisions driven by high-frequency trading spikes. Challenges of a Low Volume Environment: Lack of immediate trading opportunities for short-term traders. Increased potential for price manipulation due to thinner order books. Can lead to wider bid-ask spreads on exchanges. Market direction can be less clear without strong volume confirmation. Is This a Long-Term Holding Strategy in Action? The prevailing narrative suggests that this low volume is a strong indicator of a widespread long-term holding strategy among Bitcoin investors. The fact that volume has dropped to October 2020 levels, a period well before the major bull run of late 2020/2021, reinforces this idea. Many investors who acquired BTC during or after that period seem reluctant to part with it, perhaps anticipating future price milestones or simply believing in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition as digital gold or a hedge against inflation. This ‘HODLing’ behavior reduces the available supply on exchanges, which, when combined with potential future demand, could create conditions ripe for significant price movements down the line. It suggests that a large portion of the circulating supply is currently illiquid, held in wallets not associated with active trading. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Current Crypto Market Trends Given the current low Bitcoin trading volume environment, what should investors and traders consider? Patience is Key: This is likely not a market phase for aggressive, high-frequency trading on the spot market. Patience and observation are crucial. Focus on Long-Term Strategy: If the low volume signals accumulation and HODLing, aligning your strategy with a long-term perspective might be prudent. Consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) if you are looking to increase your position. Monitor Key Levels: Pay close attention to significant support and resistance levels. A breakout from a consolidation range on increasing volume would be a strong signal. Diversify Information Sources: Look beyond just spot volume. Examine derivatives data, on-chain metrics (like exchange reserves, long-term holder supply), and macroeconomic factors for a more complete picture of crypto market trends . Risk Management: As always, employ sound risk management. Low volume can sometimes lead to swift, sharp moves. This period of low volume offers a moment for reflection rather than reaction. It prompts a deeper dive into Bitcoin analysis to understand the underlying forces at play. Summary: A Quiet Before a Potential Storm? The dramatic drop in spot Bitcoin trading volume to levels last seen in October 2020 is a compelling data point that suggests a significant shift in market dynamics. While it presents challenges for active traders seeking volatility, it strongly supports the narrative of widespread investor ‘HODLing’ and potential accumulation. This phase of low activity could be the market consolidating before its next major move, making it a critical period for observation and strategic positioning based on thorough Bitcoin analysis and understanding of prevailing crypto market trends . Whether this quiet period is the prelude to a bullish breakout or extended consolidation remains to be seen, but the current data points towards a market content to hold rather than hastily trade.

2025-06-09T13:07:25,"Is Bitcoin still bullish or trapped in a range? key market structure at risk","Bitcoin’s recent correction raises the question: is this just a pullback, or the beginning of a range-bound market? A breakdown in structure may hint at deeper retracements ahead. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has seen a notable shift in momentum following a strong uptrend that began at the $75,000 swing low. After reaching new all-time highs, recent price action has faltered, failing to sustain its bullish trajectory. This has prompted traders to ask whether Bitcoin is gearing up for further upside, or settling into a broader consolidation phase. Technically, both outcomes are plausible, but recent structural changes suggest that Bitcoin may now be trading within a range rather than in a continued uptrend. Key technical points: Market Structure Breach: After a new all-time high, a confirmed technical low has formed, breaking the trend of higher lows. Failed Auction at Highs: Price failed to hold the breakout above the previous range high, showing signs of exhaustion. Lower High Formation: Bitcoin appears to be forming a potential lower high, which could precede a deeper correction. BTCUSD (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s uptrend was initiated by a strong impulse candle from the $75,000 region, marking the start of a powerful bullish leg. This move shifted market structure and set the stage for new highs. However, after reaching a fresh all-time high, price failed to hold the breakout zone,leading to a rejection resembling a failed auction. This failed auction reflects a common reversal pattern: an attempted breakout that lacks volume or sustained demand, followed by a sharp retracement. The recent downside move has now confirmed a local low, signaling that the prior bullish structure may be deteriorating. You might also like: Tether mints $1b USDT on Tron: liquidity flood incoming? What traders must now watch for is the formation of a lower high. If this takes shape, it could be an early sign of a more substantial correction, possibly revisiting the $75,000 support zone. Such a development would suggest Bitcoin has shifted from a trending market into a defined range, with boundaries between the $75,000 low and the all-time high above. A bearish retest of the former range high, now acting as resistance, strengthens the case for consolidation. Until Bitcoin can reclaim this level with conviction, the risk of further downside remains elevated. What to expect in the coming price action Unless Bitcoin reclaims the range high with consecutive bullish candle closes and strong volume, the prevailing structure favors a move lower. A confirmed lower high would further validate the idea that BTC is now range-bound. Traders should remain cautious near the upper boundary of this range, where the probability of rejection is higher.

According to a June 9 press release, the Paris-based company will raise around $342 million using a method inspired by U.S. “At-the-Market” (ATM) offerings. The ATM-style raise allows shares to be sold based on market demand, with pricing determined by the higher of the previous day’s closing price or the volume-weighted average price, subject to a cap of 21% of daily trading volume. The capital will be raised in tranches, providing flexibility and scalability to fund strategic Bitcoin purchases. This announcement closely follows the firm’s recent $68 million acquisition of BTC , which boosted its total holdings to 1,471 Bitcoin—valued at over $154 million at current prices. Institutional Momentum Grows Across Borders The Blockchain Group is not alone in aggressively adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet. Michael Saylor’s Strategy recently increased its planned raise to nearly $1 billion to continue its Bitcoin buying spree. Strategy remains the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with over $61 billion in Bitcoin, amounting to 2.76% of all coins in circulation, according to Bitbo data. The trend reflects a shift in how institutions view Bitcoin—not just as a speculative asset, but as a long-term treasury reserve. Firms are embracing BTC as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty and as part of a broader diversification strategy. With Europe stepping into this narrative, the region could emerge as a major player in shaping the future of institutional crypto adoption. Bitcoin Outlook Remains Bullish Despite ETF Outflows Despite a recent cooldown in price following its record-breaking $112,000 all-time high on May 22, Bitcoin continues to show strength. The cryptocurrency rebounded firmly from the $103,000 support level, with no signs of panic selling or forced liquidations, according to Nexo’s Stella Zlatareva. She emphasized that strategic treasury buys and long-term corporate accumulation signal enduring institutional confidence. While U.S.-based Bitcoin ETFs recorded over $47 million in outflows on June 6, following $278 million in redemptions the day prior, long-term sentiment remains anchored in treasury-based buying. With companies like The Blockchain Group leading the charge, Bitcoin’s narrative as a corporate reserve asset continues to grow stronger, defying short-term market fluctuations.

2025-06-09T13:00:54,"Urgent Warning: Bitcoin Price Fragile as Analysts Say Market Sentiment Awaits Key Data","BitcoinWorld Urgent Warning: Bitcoin Price Fragile as Analysts Say Market Sentiment Awaits Key Data Is the recent stability in the Bitcoin price a sign of strength, or is it the calm before a potential storm? Despite holding relatively steady around the $105,000 level, leading analysts are sounding a note of caution, suggesting that the structure supporting this price point is more delicate than it appears. Why Analysts Say the Bitcoin Price is Unstable According to recent reports, market observers believe that the current position of BTC price is precarious. Kay Lu, CEO of HashKey Eco Labs, highlights that Bitcoin is trading within a “delicate” zone. This area is said to be closely intertwined with crucial support levels. The concern is that this delicate balance could easily be disrupted. Delicate Trading Zone: BTC is hovering near key support levels, making it vulnerable to downward pressure. Risk of Panic: A single piece of negative news could potentially trigger rapid selling. Structural Fragility: The underlying market structure is not seen as robust enough to withstand significant shocks. Understanding Current Market Sentiment The broader crypto market is currently characterized by a “wait-and-see” attitude. Dominick John, an analyst at Kronos Research, points to this cautious mood among traders and investors. This sentiment is often reflected in market indicators like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. As of the analysis, the index stands at 55, which falls into the “Greed” category, but is very close to the neutral zone (50). This indicates that while there isn’t widespread fear, there isn’t overwhelming bullishness either. It suggests a market poised, perhaps uncertain, about its next major move. How Upcoming Data Could Impact BTC Price A significant factor contributing to the current uncertainty, analysts say , is the impending release of key economic data from the United States. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) figures are highly anticipated this week. These inflation indicators are crucial because they influence macroeconomic policy, particularly interest rate decisions by the Federal Reserve. Higher-than-expected inflation could lead to expectations of tighter monetary policy, which is often seen as bearish for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, lower inflation could be interpreted positively. Key Economic Data to Watch: Data Point Significance Potential Market Impact (General) Consumer Price Index (CPI) Measures inflation from the consumer’s perspective. High CPI can signal potential rate hikes (negative for crypto). Low CPI can ease rate hike fears (positive for crypto). Producer Price Index (PPI) Measures inflation from the producer’s perspective. Often seen as a leading indicator for CPI. Similar impact potential. The reaction of traditional financial markets to this data often spills over into the crypto market , affecting the Bitcoin price and altcoins alike. What Does This Mean for Traders and Investors? Given the current assessment by analysts say , the market environment calls for caution. The potential for volatility around the CPI and PPI releases is high. While the price is holding, the underlying structure is viewed as susceptible to negative catalysts. This isn’t necessarily a call for panic, but rather an acknowledgment of the heightened risk in the short term. Monitoring news flow, especially concerning regulatory developments or major market events, alongside the economic data, will be crucial. Challenges and Risks Highlighted by Analysts The primary challenge identified is the market’s structural fragility at the current price level. The main risk is that a negative event or unfavorable economic data could trigger a rapid downturn. The “wait-and-see” market sentiment means that conviction on either side (bullish or bearish) is low, making the market susceptible to sudden shifts driven by external factors. In Conclusion: Navigating the Delicate Balance While Bitcoin continues to trade around the $105,000 mark, the consensus among some analysts is that this stability is resting on a fragile foundation. The combination of a delicate technical zone, cautious market sentiment , and the upcoming influence of crucial economic data like CPI and PPI means the near-term future for the Bitcoin price could be marked by increased volatility.

2025-06-09T13:00:13,"4 Best Long Term Cryptos 2025: BlockDAG, BTC Bull, Bitcoin Hyper & Snorter Bot Presales Gain Attention!","In 2025, crypto buyers are shifting their focus toward projects that show real progress. The best long-term cryptos are earning attention not by chance, but through solid achievements. BlockDAG is at the forefront with $291 million raised in the presale, 22.1 billion coins sold, and notable moves, such as its confirmed Inter Milan partnership and a potential upcoming NBA deal teaser. Instead of throwing ideas randomly, this project is following a clear path with solid direction. Close behind are other presales, BTC Bull, Bitcoin Hyper, and Snorter Bot. Each of these presales brings something new, ranging from BTC-based DeFi to interactive earning and AI-enhanced trading. For those looking past empty promises, these four names stand out among the best long-term cryptos. 1. BlockDAG: Over $291M Raised with Global Expansion Underway BlockDAG is not just gaining market attention. It’s locking in global recognition. With a confirmed partnership with Inter Milan and potential collaboration with the NBA, the team is following a clear and strategic outreach. This isn’t random exposure; it’s a detailed plan. The project has already raised $291 million, sold over 22.1 billion coins, and achieved a 2,520% ROI since stage 1. Currently, in stage 28, BDAG coins are available at $0.0262, but for a limited time, the price has been dropped to $0.0018. The presale momentum is backed by a focused growth plan and increasing public interest. Over 1.5 million users have joined the X1 mining app, proving BlockDAG’s reach. For those tracking the best long term cryptos, BlockDAG (BDAG) clearly sets a leading example. If the GO LIVE reveal happens, it could further boost its impact. 2. BTC Bull: Tapping Into Bitcoin’s Strength with Added Utility BTC Bull builds on Bitcoin’s strength but adds more use through a DeFi system. Rather than depending only on Bitcoin’s image, it supports BTC liquidity providers with useful tools. Early presale buyers gain access to farming features, easy staking options, and conversion tools that follow BTC’s market flow. The aim is to add a new layer of benefits while still using Bitcoin’s global name. While it’s still in its early phase, BTC Bull’s direct link to Bitcoin’s movement places it among the best long term cryptos gaining interest for 2025. 3. Bitcoin Hyper: Changing BTC Rewards Through Interactive Play Bitcoin Hyper changes the usual crypto holding method. It mixes BTC rewards with a gaming-style system where users finish tasks, unlock goals, and earn payouts. This gives people a more involved way to benefit from Bitcoin. Instead of just promoting its token details, Bitcoin Hyper uses behavior-based rewards to keep users engaged. This attracts both casual crypto fans and those with a long-term view, helping it reach a wide group. Its presale is active, and early buyers can get bonus allocations. That’s why Bitcoin Hyper is counted among the best long-term cryptos, blending engagement and financial gains. 4. Snorter Bot: Bringing AI Tools to Everyday Crypto Users Snorter Bot makes crypto trading easier using AI. It uses market data, trend signals, and volume activity to guide trading decisions. Those who hold the coin get benefits like shared profits and access to extra features. What makes Snorter Bot presale unique in the best long term crypto list is its simplicity. You don’t need trading knowledge, just holding the coin activates the benefits. The ongoing presale is pushing for early testers and more community members, offering a smart choice for people who want easy access to crypto trading tools. Summing Up! Solid actions are standing out over noise, and the best long term cryptos in 2025 are proving this with real movement. BlockDAG shows strong proof with 22.1 billion coins sold, a $291 million presale, and high user adoption. Deals like Inter Milan and the potential upcoming NBA collab show serious reach. BTC Bull builds on Bitcoin with DeFi functions, Bitcoin Hyper rewards activity through gamification, and Snorter Bot connects AI with passive rewards. Each one brings something solid to the table. But among all, BlockDAG’s clear strategy and public results make it a top name when talking about the best long term cryptos to follow in 2025.

Long-term forecasts estimate BTC prices could hit $900K by 2030. The Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 is turning increasingly bullish. This surge in optimism is driven by record-breaking inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, rising institutional interest, and strong political support, including Trump’s plan to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. With companies like GameStop and Trump Media adding BTC to their balance sheets, and the Fed signaling potential rate cuts, investors are asking one critical question: Will Bitcoin go back up and lead the next financial revolution? What is the Bitcoin price prediction for today? The BTC price may range between $$104,232.70 and $105,579.56 today.

Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 In April and May 2025, Bitcoin saw a strong and steady rally, driven by easing trade war tensions, pushing the price to a new all-time high of $112K . Now, in early June, BTC is trying to hold support near the previous May swing low after pulling back from its peak. On June 6th , a positive U.S. jobs report and the resumption of U.S.-China trade talks sparked a short-term bounce from the 50-day EMA’s dynamic support . However, Bitcoin is still facing resistance from a multi-month supply block . If it breaks above this level with strong momentum, BTC could retest $120K by the end of June .On the flip side, if bearish pressure increases, the swing support zone becomes critical . A breakdown below this level could drag the price down to the $100K–$95K range in the near term. Additionally, market sentiment remains firmly bullish. The BTC long/short ratio has climbed to 1.0404, signaling that long positions are outnumbering shorts — a strong indicator of growing investor confidence. Notably, retail investors are leading the charge. Wallets holding up to 1 BTC have been accumulating aggressively, reflecting renewed optimism among small holders. At the same time, rising funding rates and a steady increase in total open interest further support the case for short-term bullish momentum. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High June 2025 $95,000 $103,500 – $108,000 $120,000 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 A key factor driving the potential for higher Bitcoin prices is the relationship with global liquidity. Historical trends reveal that as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences dramatic price surges. Now, with global liquidity beginning to rise again after a prolonged period of stagnation, the stage seems set for another major rally in Bitcoin’s value. This shift in liquidity could create the perfect environment for Bitcoin to soar once more. Also, cryptoquant data suggest that accumulation is on top with exchange reserve declining at more alarming rates. When writing 2.4 Milliion BTC were in total on the exchange reserves, which is a strong decline from a year ago when reserves were 3.1 Million BTC. Source: CryptoQuant Talking about Bitcoin Price Prediction, if things turn bullish, BTC is expected to create a high of $175K. If things go south, we can expect a low of $70K.

2025-06-09T12:57:04,"Pi Network News Today: Analyst Reveals Strategy Behind Massive GCV vs Market Price Gap","The post Pi Network News Today: Analyst Reveals Strategy Behind Massive GCV vs Market Price Gap appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Pi Network’s one of the biggest challenges currently is the huge gap between its Global Consensus Value (GCV) and the real market price. While GCV values 1 Pi at a whopping $314,159, the actual market price is only around $1 or less. Pi Network stands out with its dual value system, but this unique setup is also raising concerns over its utility, transparency and growth potential. A Strategic Plan? Analyst Mr Spock belives that this may be part of a long-term strategic plan rather than a flaw. He says that this creates two separate economies – Inside the Pi ecosystem, apps and services use the high GCV price, and outside, on exchanges, Pi trades like a regular altcoin at market prices. The system keeps these values separate using controls like wallet locks and KYC, creating two linked but distinct economies. Analyst Notes Strengths and Risks of the Dual Value System He notes some key strengths of the dual value system like – it builds merchant trust, creates stability for apps, and protects against market volatility. But he also warned of major risks. People might exploit this by buying cheap Pi from exchanges and spending it at the much higher GCV rate within the ecosystem. Having two very different prices for Pi can confuse users and make outsiders doubt the project. Also, Pi’s dual-value model survives on community trust. If users favor market prices over GCV, its relevance could quickly fade. Can Pi Core Team Help? In order to protect the system, he also suggested the Pi Core Team to take actions like limiting access to KYC-verified users and enforcing GCV through smart contracts. He also suggested Pi lock-ups to limit supply, and slowly close the price gap as real use increases. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Network News: Users Outraged Over Missing Tokens Despite KYC Completion , Many pioneers in support of GCV note that smart contracts with GCV rates have been uploaded to GitHub, and communities in places like Thailand and Vietnam actively use the GCV in transactions. “This mission is alive because of all of us,” said Lumari, a committed Pioneer. The analyst noted that the real value of Pi comes from trust, utility, and community, not just price charts. Pi coin has dropped over 60% in May. With an estimated supply of 100 billion coins, valuing each at GCV would make Pi worth over $31 quadrillion, that would be far more than the world’s entire GDP. But still the users don’t seem to budge. Steady But Uneven Activity Dr. Altcoin said in a recent YouTube video that 3.35 million Pi were moved to the mainnet in the last 24 hours, and 7.9 million Pi were unlocked today. This shows steady but uneven activity because of KYC delays and migration backlogs. Pi is trading around $0.63, with a $4.63 billion market cap. In the short term, he expects Pi to trade between $0.618 and $0.641. If the price stays above $0.625, it could go up to $0.64. He says that how newly unlocked Pi is distributed, is key for price movement. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-09T12:52:06,"Tether mints $1b USDT on Tron: liquidity flood incoming?","Just months after its previous major mint event, Tether has once again minted a significant amount of tokens, likely in anticipation of increased demand. A recent move suggests Tether is preparing for a new wave of liquidity. On Monday, June 9, Tether minted $1 billion USDT on the Tron (TRX) blockchain, according to several blockchain analysts . This represents a sizable liquidity injection, even for the world’s largest stablecoin. Notably, the $1 billion mint accounts for more than 1% of all USDT supply on Tron, the blockchain that hosts the majority of USDT tokens. Currently, USDT supply on Tron stands at $76 billion, followed by Ethereum (ETH) with $63.2 billion. Tether’s total circulating supply is 156 billion. You might also like: Tether CEO denies reports as US probes and weighs sanctions Tether’s move is seen as a bullish signal by many traders. Historically, the stablecoin issuer mints USDT in anticipation of future demand for liquidity. While the freshly minted tokens have not yet entered circulation, their creation suggests that Tether expects rising demand and increased trading volume in the near term. This behavior has led to a recurring pattern: USDT issuance often coincides with bullish momentum across the crypto market. Tether’s last major mint occurred on May 21, when it issued 2 billion USDT on Tron. Just one day later, Bitcoin rose to its all-time high of $111,000.

Notably, analyst Jon Ma estimated that a Tether IPO would value the company at $515 billion. However, CEO Paolo Ardoino dismissed the idea, stating there is no need for the company to go public. Still, listing publicly would bring greater financial transparency—an area where Tether has faced longstanding criticism. Most recently, proposed U.S. stablecoin regulation has raised concerns that Tether could be pushed out of the market unless it adjusts its approach to disclosures.

2025-06-09T12:50:29,"Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will XRP Reach $5?","The post Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will XRP Reach $5? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights Live XRP Price: $ 2.24635117 . Predictions suggest XRP could reach $5.05 by the end of 2025. Long-term projections show XRP could hit $26.50 by 2030 and $526 by 2050. XRP, one of the top five crypto assets known for its role in cross-border payments, is drawing increased attention as institutional adoption grows and its long-standing legal battle nears a conclusion. Since President Trump took office, Ripple XRP has gained significant traction, fueled by rising on-chain activity, bullish market sentiment, and increasing speculation around a potential XRP ETF Approval in 2025. With these developments in play, XRP price prediction is becoming a major focus for investors. Can XRP reach $100? Is a $500 target realistic in the long term? This article dives deep into XRP price prediction for 2025 and beyond through 2030. Table of contents CoinPedia’s Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025 XRP Price Today XRP Crypto Price Prediction June 2025 XRP Price Prediction 2025 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 XRP Price Prediction 2026 Ripple Price Prediction 2027 XRP Price Prediction 2028 XRP Price Prediction 2029 XRP Price Prediction 2030 Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis Institutional XRP Price Targets for 2025 FAQs CoinPedia’s Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025 With regulatory clarity from the SEC case and Ripple accelerating its expansion, we at CoinPedia are optimistic about the XRP forecast. We expect the XRP coin price to reach $5.81 in 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 XRP Price Today Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 2.24635117 -1.24% Market cap $ 132,134,088,034.64 Circulating Supply 58,821,652,442.00 Trading Volume $ 2,617,809,139.3076 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Crypto Price Prediction June 2025 XRP is currently in a pullback phase after testing the upper boundary of a multi-month descending wedge at $2.65 in mid-May. Since then, it has slipped below a key high-volume profile level. In early June, XRP is trying to hold above the previous swing low of $2.10 . Over the past few days, the price has seen a modest bounce to $2.25 , but it’s facing resistance due to a bearish crossover between the 20-day and 50-day EMA . If selling pressure continues and XRP breaks below the $2.10 support —which aligns closely with the 200-day EMA —the price could decline further toward $1.88 or even $1.63 .On the upside, if XRP breaks past the short-term EMA crossover and reclaims the key $2.40 resistance , it could trigger a rally toward $2.80 , with a chance to retest the all-time high of $3.40 later in June . However, momentum depends heavily on rising volume and increased volatility —both of which have been lacking during the recent bounce. Without these, XRP may stay in a consolidation phase or continue its downtrend. But if buying interest returns with higher volume and volatility, a sharp price surge could follow this month. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High June 2025 $1.7 $2.45 $3.40 XRP Price Prediction 2025 If XRP successfully breaks its all-time high of $3.40 in May 2025—a major supply zone on the chart—it could realistically target $5 by year-end, fueled by growing optimism from banks , institutions, and potential ETF support. Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD , is now integrated into its cross-border payments system, Ripple Payments, further strengthening its position in global finance. Notably, institutional dominance is evident, with the top 100 addresses holding 70% of the circulating supply, positioning XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $138 billion. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.05 $3.45 $5.05 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.50 6.25 8.50 2027 7.00 9.0 13.25 2028 11.25 13.75 16.00 2029 14.25 16.50 21.50 2030 17.00 19.75 26.50 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP cost will likely witness strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.50 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum price of XRP will be around $5.50, with an average trading price of $6.25. Ripple Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP coin price will range between $7.00 to $13.25. XRP price might record an average level of $9.00. XRP Price Prediction 2028 As per our XRP price prediction 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases. We expect the XRP future price to range between $11.25 to $16.00. The average trading price of Ripple could be around $13.75. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The price of XRP might record a trading range between $14.25 to $21.50, with an average price of $16.50. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The XRP prediction 2030 depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the Ripple coin price could scale between $17.00 to $26.50. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.75. Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Based on historic price sentiments and XRP’s rising popularity, here are the XRP future price projections for 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, and 2050. Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2031 25.00 29.50 35.25 2032 31.50 36.75 41.25 2033 35.75 42.25 47.75 2040 97.50 135.50 179.00 2050 219.25 331.50 526.00 Market Analysis Firm Name 2025 2026 2030 Changelly $2.05 $3.49 $17.76 Coincodex $2.38 $1.83 $1.66 Binance $2.16 $2.27 $2.76 Institutional XRP Price Targets for 2025 Name Target Standard Chartered $5.50 Sistine Research $33 to $50 Final Thoughts: Is XRP Still a Good Investment? Yes, XRP is still a good investment for those with a long-term view. With the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit nearing settlement, increasing institutional interest, and rising on-chain activity, XRP’s fundamentals remain strong. The integration of RLUSD and potential ETF listings further boosts its utility and market potential. While short-term volatility may persist, XRP price prediction models point to significant upside. If regulatory clarity continues, XRP could be well-positioned to reach ambitious targets like $100—or even higher—in the coming years. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-09T12:50:06,"Spot ETH ETFs See Astonishing $281M Inflows, Extending Winning Streak","BitcoinWorld Spot ETH ETFs See Astonishing $281M Inflows, Extending Winning Streak Get ready for some exciting news from the world of crypto finance! The U.S. Spot ETH ETFs are continuing their impressive run, pulling in hundreds of millions in fresh capital. This isn’t just a one-off event; it signals growing confidence and momentum in the market. Understanding the Significance of Ethereum ETF Inflows When we talk about Ethereum ETF inflows , we’re referring to the net amount of money flowing into these regulated investment products designed to track the price of Ethereum. Think of an ETF like a basket of assets you can buy and sell on traditional stock exchanges. A spot ETH ETF specifically holds actual Ethereum as its underlying asset. Why are these inflows so significant? Institutional Interest: Large inflows often indicate that big players – like asset managers, hedge funds, and institutional investors – are putting money into these products. This is crucial for mainstream adoption. Market Validation: Consistent inflows provide validation for Ethereum as an investable asset class within traditional financial frameworks. Accessibility: ETFs make it easier for everyday investors to get exposure to Ethereum without directly buying and storing the cryptocurrency themselves. The recent data paints a clear picture: investors are increasingly comfortable accessing Ethereum through regulated ETF structures. Recent Performance: Spot ETH ETFs Maintain Momentum According to data tracked by SoSoValue, U.S. Spot ETH ETFs collectively saw a net inflow of a substantial $281 million last week. This follows a pattern of positive activity that has now extended for four consecutive weeks. Let’s break down the key numbers: Weekly Net Inflow: $281 million Consecutive Positive Weeks: Four Total Assets Under Management (AUM): Approximately $9.4 billion This consistent positive flow is a strong indicator of sustained demand and positive sentiment surrounding Ethereum and its regulated investment vehicles. Which Funds Are Leading the Way? While multiple issuers offer Spot ETH ETFs, one fund stood out last week: BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust, trading under the ticker BlackRock ETHA . This fund accounted for a significant portion of the total inflows. Last week, BlackRock ETHA recorded approximately $249 million in net inflows. This dominant performance highlights the influence and reach of major asset managers in attracting investor capital to the crypto space via ETFs. How Do These Inflows Compare to the Broader Crypto ETF Market? The performance of the Crypto ETF Market has been closely watched, especially since the launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. While Bitcoin ETFs initially saw massive inflows followed by periods of outflows, the recent trend for Ethereum ETFs has been steadily positive since their launch. Comparing the two: Bitcoin ETFs paved the way, establishing the framework for spot crypto products in the U.S. The success and investor familiarity with Bitcoin ETFs likely contributed to a smoother reception for Spot ETH ETFs. The consistent inflows into Ethereum products suggest that investors are now broadening their crypto exposure beyond just Bitcoin through these regulated avenues. What Do These ETH ETF Inflows Signal for the Future? The sustained ETH ETF inflows carry several potential implications for the market: Increased Liquidity: More capital flowing into the ETFs can increase their trading volume and liquidity, making them more attractive to larger investors. Potential Price Impact: While not a direct one-to-one correlation, consistent buying pressure from large funds managing these ETFs can contribute to upward price momentum for Ethereum itself. Validation of Ethereum’s Ecosystem: The interest in ETH ETFs underscores the growing recognition of Ethereum’s role as the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and numerous other blockchain applications. Regulatory Comfort: The approval and successful launch of these products signal increasing regulatory comfort, which could pave the way for other crypto-related investment products in the future. However, it’s important to remember that the crypto market remains volatile. While inflows are positive, prices can still fluctuate based on broader market sentiment, regulatory news, and macroeconomic factors. Challenges and Considerations Despite the positive inflow trend, the Crypto ETF Market , including ETH ETFs, still faces challenges: Market Volatility: Ethereum’s price is subject to significant swings, which directly impacts the value of the ETFs. Regulatory Landscape: While approved, the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies and related products continues to evolve globally. Investor Education: Ensuring investors understand the specific risks associated with crypto assets, even within an ETF wrapper, is crucial. These factors mean that while the trend is encouraging, investors should approach ETH ETFs with a clear understanding of the associated risks. Actionable Insights for Investors For those watching the Spot ETH ETFs space, here are some takeaways: Monitor Inflow Trends: Consistent inflows suggest positive sentiment and potential buying pressure. Observe BlackRock ETHA’s Performance: As a leading fund, its activity can be a bellwether for broader institutional interest. Understand the Product: Know how ETH ETFs work and compare different offerings in terms of fees and structure. Consider Your Risk Tolerance: Investing in crypto-linked products means accepting a higher level of risk compared to traditional assets. The current trend indicates robust demand, but informed decision-making is always key. Conclusion: A Bullish Signal for Ethereum and the Crypto ETF Market The sustained $281 million net inflow into U.S. Spot ETH ETFs last week, marking the fourth consecutive week of gains, is a powerful signal. Led by significant contributions like those seen in BlackRock ETHA , these inflows underscore growing institutional and retail interest in accessing Ethereum through regulated, traditional finance products. The expanding AUM of nearly $9.4 billion further solidifies the presence of Ethereum within the mainstream investment landscape. This positive momentum for Ethereum ETF Inflows is not just good news for the individual funds but also reflects increasing confidence in the broader Crypto ETF Market and the underlying Ethereum network itself. While challenges remain, the current trajectory points towards continued integration of crypto assets into global financial portfolios.

2025-06-09T12:46:50,"Ethereum No Longer Just Hype, Moving to Real-World Use, Says Bernstein Analyst","The post Ethereum No Longer Just Hype, Moving to Real-World Use, Says Bernstein Analyst appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, seems to be at a turning point. While Bitcoin still grabs most of the headlines, some experts believe that Ethereum is quietly stepping into the spotlight. Analysts at Bernstein believe Ethereum is no longer just a playground for speculation but is starting to show real-world value as financial activity on blockchain networks grows. Bitcoin Remains Strong, But Ethereum’s Role Expands For years, Bitcoin has been the poster child of digital money, and it’s not slowing down. In fact, analysts at Bernstein expect it to reach a whopping $200,000 this cycle, a figure they still call conservative. But analysts say there’s more to watch in crypto now, with Ethereum playing a bigger role. Unlike Bitcoin, which is mostly seen as a digital store of value, Ethereum acts as a “decentralized computer,” hosting stablecoins and tokenized assets. It’s already the main blockchain for stablecoin transactions and new financial experiments, which could be a sign of things to come. Ethereum ETFs Gaining Investor Attention So far, Ethereum’s U.S. spot ETFs haven’t gotten the same attention as Bitcoin’s. Since launching in July, they’ve gathered about $9 billion, compared to Bitcoin ETFs’ $120 billion. However, in the past three weeks alone, ETH ETFs have seen $815 million in new money, suggesting that interest is picking up. The growing flow of investment is seen as a signal that more investors are taking Ethereum seriously. Analysts believe this could be the early stage of a major shift for the crypto market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Prediction: Will This Week’s CPI Report Trigger a Rally? , Real Companies Turn to Ethereum Meanwhile, Bernstein points out that major payment giants like Visa and Mastercard are already working on projects that use stablecoins running on Ethereum’s blockchain. Even big names in crypto, like Coinbase and Robinhood, are building services on Ethereum rather than just offering trading. The analysts argue that if companies and financial institutions are using blockchain technology, Ethereum, as the main network powering these activities, should benefit in the long run. Hype to Real Financial Tools Experts say this moment marks a change in how people see crypto. Ethereum is no longer just for speculation. It’s becoming part of how payments, investing, and financial products might work in the future. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Table of contents Overview Polygon Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Polygon Price Action 2026 POL Price Prediction 2027 Polygon Crypto Price Forecast 2028 MATIC Coin Price Projection 2029 Polygon Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Polygon Token MATIC Price $ 0.21819891 2.88% Market Cap $ 0.00 Trading Volume $ 1,217,344.7306 Circulating Supply 0.00 All-time High $1.29 Mar 14, 2024 All-time Low $0.1533 Apr 07, 2025 Polygon Price Prediction 2025 As evident on the POL/USD daily chart on COINBASE, its price fell in Q1 2025, along with other altcoins in the market, due to trade deal problems in the US. This led investors to refrain from investing in the entire market and watch from the sidelines. However, in Q2 2025’s April month onwards, momentum started as investors got a glimpse of improving geopolitical situations and other positive factors. However, like every other altcoin, POL price action didn’t have a big rise in early May, and it lost its strength early on after reaching $0.269. Even the RSI has slipped below the median line and has taken rejection from the 14-day SMA smoothing line. Despite the loss in momentum, the bears have not been dominant yet, and it is consolidating near the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands and key support zone. But if it breaks the support zone’s low of $0.194, then bearish forces will take control and push it down to the $0.15 level. However, if the conditions improve, then the 0.5 Fibonacci level at $0.4572 could act as a magnet for the POL price to rise. This level also aligns with early 2025’s price action-based high-volume profile level. If it successfully clears the $0.4572 level in June, there is a higher chance that the POL price might hit the Fibonacci 0.786 level at $0.6336 and the other at $0.7655 by the end of the year 2025. On the contrary, if the $0.4572 proves to be too strong to break, then there is a strong chance for bears to take over the trend and repel the price from the fibonacci 0.5 level to the lows of 2025.

2025-06-09T12:42:32,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Smart Money Is Watching These Two Levels – Are You?","Bitcoin (BTC) has snapped its two-week losing streak, rebounding from a low of $100,200 to trade above $107,600. This upward shift follows BTC’s decisive break through a multi-week descending trendline on the 4-hour chart, a move that technical traders view as a short-term momentum reversal. What triggered the move? A bullish engulfing candle pierced through $106,800, a key resistance level now acting as short-term support. Additionally, BTC is posting higher lows, forming a textbook bullish pattern. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 66.76, suggesting the current rally is gaining strength but is approaching overbought territory. The next critical resistance is $108,905. If that breaks, Bitcoin price prediction could target $110,565 and even $111,987 in a bullish continuation. Smart Money Eyes $103,700 and $95,600 Beyond the technicals, on-chain metrics are painting a clear picture of where smart money is watching. According to Glassnode ‘s Spendable Supply Distribution (SSD), 95% of all circulating BTC was purchased at a price below $103,700. That level now acts as a psychological and statistical floor, which analysts often refer to as “cost-basis support.” Bitcoin Quantiles Cost Basis. Source: Glassnode Another critical level lies at $95,600, where 85% of the Bitcoin supply has a lower acquisition price. These quantile thresholds create “value zones” where institutional and long-term investors are likely to step in and defend the price. If Bitcoin pulls back from current levels, expect these two price areas to serve as buffers before any deeper correction. Key Support Zones: $103,700: 95% SSD threshold $95,600: 85% SSD cost basis $106,800: Trendline retest zone Bitcoin Outlook: Bullish Setup with Short-Term Caution Despite increased pressure from long-term holders (LTHs) taking profits, historical data signals that June is usually favorable for Bitcoin. The median monthly return stands at +2.58%, signaling that the current rebound may still have legs. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Traders should, however, approach the current setup with discipline. The breakout just above $106,800 is promising; however, a failed break over $108,905 could lead to a solid retracement. The relative strength index (RSI) levels signal a cooldown that might be needed before bulls can clear the next hurdle. Trade Idea: Entry: Wait for a confirmed 4-hour close above $108,905 Stop-loss: Place below $106,800 Target 1: $110,565 Target 2: $111,987 Note: Avoid entering prematurely; RSI is approaching overbought In short, smart money is tracking both the $103,700 and $95,600 zones for value, while the breakout structure signals a bullish bias, provided BTC holds its ground Bitcoin Hyper Presale Hits $821K—Layer 2 Just Got a Meme-Sized Upgrade Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is taking off as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2, combining speed, scalability, and meme culture.

2025-06-09T12:40:11,"US spot Bitcoin ETFs Face Shocking Net Outflows Totaling $128.81M Last Week","BitcoinWorld US spot Bitcoin ETFs Face Shocking Net Outflows Totaling $128.81M Last Week Hey crypto enthusiasts and investors! Let’s dive into the latest buzz from the world of institutional Bitcoin adoption. While the launch of US spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year was met with immense excitement and saw billions pour in, the flow isn’t always one-way. Recent data reveals a notable shift, with these investment vehicles experiencing net outflows. Understanding the Recent Bitcoin ETF Outflows According to fresh data compiled by SoSoValue, the cohort of US spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively recorded a net outflow of $128.81 million over the past week. This figure represents the total amount of money leaving these funds exceeding the amount entering them during that period. It’s a key metric that investors and market watchers use to gauge sentiment and demand for Bitcoin exposure via these regulated products. While the overall number shows money exiting the category, the picture is more nuanced when you look at individual funds. Not all ETFs experienced the same fate: BlackRock’s IBIT: Standing out against the trend, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) actually saw positive flows. It attracted a net inflow of $81 million last week, indicating continued demand for this specific product. Fidelity’s FBTC: On the other side of the spectrum, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) faced the largest net outflow, with $168 million exiting the fund. Other ETFs: Other smaller US spot Bitcoin ETFs also contributed to the net outflow figure, though IBIT and FBTC represent the most significant movements in either direction. Why Are We Seeing These Flows? Understanding the drivers behind Bitcoin ETF outflows is crucial. Several factors can influence whether investors are buying or selling shares in these funds: Market Volatility and Price Action: Bitcoin’s price movements significantly impact investor sentiment. Periods of price consolidation or downturns can lead some investors to take profits or reduce exposure, resulting in outflows. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic indicators, interest rate expectations, and global market sentiment can influence appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. Profit-Taking: Many early investors in these ETFs, or those who converted from GBTC (which saw significant outflows upon conversion), might be cashing out after significant gains since the ETFs launched. Competition and Fund-Specific Dynamics: While less likely to cause net category outflows, competition among ETFs or specific news related to a fund manager could influence flows between different products like IBIT and FBTC. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin AUM ? Despite the recent net outflows, the total assets under management (AUM) held within US spot Bitcoin ETFs remains substantial. As of June 6th, these funds collectively managed an impressive $125.58 billion in assets. This figure highlights the significant amount of institutional and retail capital that has flowed into the Bitcoin ecosystem through these regulated investment vehicles since their inception. While a week of outflows is worth noting, it’s important to view it in the context of the overall picture. The rapid accumulation of over $125 billion in Bitcoin AUM in just a few months demonstrates the strong underlying demand and the success of these products in providing accessible Bitcoin exposure. IBIT vs. FBTC : A Closer Look The contrasting performance of IBIT and FBTC last week is particularly interesting. BlackRock’s continued ability to attract inflows, even as others face redemptions, could be attributed to various factors, including their vast distribution network, brand recognition, and potentially lower fees or specific fund structures that appeal to certain investor segments. Conversely, FBTC experiencing the largest outflow could be due to a variety of reasons, including specific investor bases within Fidelity taking profits or rebalancing portfolios. Here’s a quick look at the key numbers from last week: ETF Issuer Net Flow Last Week Overall US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Various -$128.81 million IBIT BlackRock +$81 million FBTC Fidelity -$168 million Data Source: SoSoValue (as referenced) Actionable Insights for Investors So, what should you take away from this news? Here are a few actionable insights: Monitor Flows: Keep an eye on weekly and daily flow data for US spot Bitcoin ETFs . While one week isn’t a trend, sustained outflows could signal shifting sentiment. Look Beyond the Headline: Understand which specific ETFs are seeing flows. The performance of IBIT and FBTC can offer clues about different investor segments. Context is Key: Evaluate ETF flows alongside other market indicators like price action, on-chain data, and macroeconomic news. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that ETFs provide a long-term investment vehicle. Short-term fluctuations in flows are normal market behavior. The significant Bitcoin AUM still reflects strong long-term interest. Concluding Thoughts The past week saw US spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively experience net outflows, a notable shift after months of significant inflows. While the $128.81 million figure represents a relatively small percentage of the total $125.58 billion in Bitcoin AUM , it serves as a reminder that market dynamics are constantly evolving. The contrasting flows between funds like IBIT (inflows) and FBTC (outflows) highlight the diverse strategies and investor bases within the ETF ecosystem. Monitoring these flows provides valuable insights into institutional and retail interest in Bitcoin, but it’s essential to consider the broader market context and maintain a long-term perspective on Bitcoin’s adoption journey.

2025-06-09T12:32:02,"Restaking Bitcoin: Unlocking Productive Capital Without Compromise (Interview With SatLayer’s CEO)","As the field of decentralized finance (DeFi) continues evolving, Bitcoin’s role within it is being quietly (or not so much) redefined. While the primary cryptocurrency has long stood (and perhaps, continues to) as a passive store of value, newer frameworks like restaking protocols are emerging to unlock its tremendous economic potential without altering its base-layer integrity. In this exciting interview with Luke Xie, the co-founder and CEO of SatLayer, we explore how the concept of Bitcoin restaking could reshape its utility across DeFi. From programmable slashing logic to multi-chain security coordination, however, restaking presents both technical hurdles and considerable opportunities. So stay tuned and let’s dive right into it. What role do you think the Bitcoin Reserve in the US will play in decentralized finance? The U.S. Bitcoin Reserve symbolizes mainstream validation of Bitcoin’s long-term value. While it may not directly participate in DeFi, its existence underpins trust in Bitcoin as a pristine, censorship-resistant collateral asset. This trust creates a stronger foundation for decentralized finance built on Bitcoin. The more confidence institutions and sovereign entities have in BTC, the more likely DeFi protocols are to adopt it as a core asset — unlocking composability, liquidity, and programmability that respects Bitcoin’s ethos. What are the biggest technical challenges in bringing restaking to Bitcoin? Xie summarized the challenges into three main groups. Slashing programmability across diverse BVSs Unlike traditional staking, which is typically binary (you either sign correctly or not), restaking introduces service-specific enforcement. Each BVS — whether it’s an oracle, bridge, DEX, or rollup — has its own definition of misbehavior. The challenge lies in designing slashing logic that is not only programmable and verifiable, but also flexible enough to adapt to the needs of each individual service. Secure multi-BVS coordination Operators often secure multiple BVSs at the same time, each with its own rules and risk parameters. Ensuring that slashing and reward logic is correctly isolated or cross-enforced — without compromising security or fairness — is a critical part of restaking infrastructure design. Vault design and isolation guarantees Restakers deposit BTC LSTs into vaults that connect to one or more BVSs. Each vault inherits that service’s specific slashing conditions and risk exposure. The challenge is ensuring restakers have full visibility into what risks they’re opting into, with clearly encoded slashing logic, predictable withdrawal flows, and transparent grace period mechanics. What advantages does Bitcoin restaking offer compared to traditional staking in proof-of-stake ecosystems? Bitcoin’s market cap is at $2.1T (as of May 23, 2025) and yet over 90% of Bitcoin sits idle — stored but unused, with its economic potential untapped. Restaking changes that. It transforms BTC from passive capital into productive, yield-generating collateral, unlocking powerful economic utility without altering Bitcoin’s base layer. Bitcoin restaking pairs BTC’s unmatched economic credibility with a fee-based, utility-driven yield model. Unlike traditional proof-of-stake systems that rely on inflationary emissions and dilute token holders, Bitcoin restaking is built on real services and real demand. Restaked BTC is used to secure Bitcoin Validated Services (BVSs) — decentralized use-cases like on-chain insurance coverage and liquidity float provisioning — that generate protocol-level fees from day one. This means restakers earn sustainable, non-inflationary yield based on the actual economic value they contribute, not just for locking up capital. With SatLayer, restaked BTC doesn’t just secure a single chain — it can support a modular, multi-chain ecosystem, from rollups and bridges to oracles and appchains. Restakers gain exposure to multiple sources of real yield without being tied to any one protocol’s inflation schedule. What does a “productive BTC” world look like in the next 2–3 years, and what needs to happen to get there? A “productive BTC” world is one where Bitcoin is no longer just a passive store of value — it’s actively securing decentralized systems, earning real yield, and serving as pristine collateral across DeFi and real-world applications. In this future, BTC is restaked to secure critical infrastructure like oracles, rollups, bridges, and appchains. The rewards aren’t driven by inflation or speculative tokenomics, but by delivering tangible, economically valuable security to networks that need it. The yield is real — paid by users and applications that derive genuine utility and trust from Bitcoin’s economic weight. At the center of this transformation is SatLayer — the protocol that connects BTC holders, emerging protocols, and real economic activity. To make this future a reality, SatLayer is, from day one, onboarding Bitcoin Validated Services (BVSs) — revenue generating decentralized services that rely on Bitcoin-backed restaking to function securely — in order to generate sustainable, real, protocol-level fees. This design promotes a crucial mindset shift: BTC holders are no longer just “hodling” — they’re empowered to put their assets to work and earn sustainable, ecosystem-driven yield. As this takes hold, it sets off a self-sustaining, incentives-aligned flywheel: BTC enters productive restaking via SatLayer. Protocols gain Bitcoin-backed security, boosting their credibility and resilience. Restakers earn real sustainable yield, increasing Bitcoin’s utility and appeal. That yield attracts more BTC into the system, amplifying its security guarantees. More projects choose to build on Bitcoin-backed security, unlocking even more yield opportunities. With SatLayer as the foundation, BTC evolves from digital gold into the economic engine of a secure, decentralized future. How is SatLayer approaching security and slashing risks in a modular, multi-chain restaking model? Built with a security-first mindset, SatLayer’s core infrastructure undergoes quarterly third-party audits by leading security firms, along with continuous testing and formal verification of critical components. But SatLayer’s real innovation lies in how it handles risk: through programmable, application-specific slashing. Unlike traditional staking models with one-size-fits-all penalties, SatLayer enables each Bitcoin Validated Service (BVS) to define its own slashing logic — customized to its specific use case, security requirements, and threat model. Example : In the context of an on-chain coverage BVS, Bitcoin restakers provide security guarantees for underwriting smart contract risk or protocol failures. In the event that an insured protocol fails — due to a hack, smart contract bug, liquidation shortfall, or depeg — programmable logic can trigger a slash and initiate payouts. Essentially, BVSs act as decentralized claims adjudicators — ingesting on-chain events, oracle data, and even off-chain proofs to verify claims and execute coverage. This modular, opt-in security model ensures that Bitcoin restakers are only ever exposed to risks they explicitly accept, with full visibility into each BVS’s slashing logic and parameters before delegating capital. By combining audit-grade infrastructure with programmable risk management, SatLayer brings Bitcoin-grade assurance to a dynamic, restaking environment — all while preserving sovereignty and minimizing unintended exposure. How can Bitcoin’s credibility and SatLayer’s infrastructure help rebuild trust in decentralized finance? The 2022–2023 wave of DeFi failures exposed the dangers of over-financialization and opaque, mispriced risk. Bitcoin offers a counterweight — with monetary clarity, fixed supply, and a neutral, non-inflationary baseline. And SatLayer extends that clarity into DeFi. By enabling BTC to secure protocols through restaking — in a transparent, opt-in way — it replaces governance-heavy systems with code-enforced trust. When decentralized services are underpinned by Bitcoin’s credibility and SatLayer’s modular, verifiable economic layer, they gain stronger guarantees, are fundamentally more resilient — and become more aligned with the original values of decentralization: trustless execution, transparent logic, user sovereignty, and censorship resistance. What’s a major misconception the crypto community has about Bitcoin’s potential role in DeFi? A major misconception in the crypto community is that Bitcoin can’t play an active role in DeFi — that it’s only useful as a passive store of value, not as programmable collateral. This belief stems from Bitcoin’s deliberately minimal scripting model and the absence of native smart contracts. As a result, many assume that BTC must be wrapped, bridged, or fundamentally compromised to participate in decentralized applications. But that’s changing. Protocols like SatLayer challenge this assumption head on — introducing restaking and slashing mechanisms that extend Bitcoin’s utility without sacrificing its core principles. Through opt-in vaults, verifiable operator behavior, and programmable economic enforcement, Bitcoin can now provide r eal, cryptoeconomic security to services like oracles, insurance, bridges, and liquidity layers — without being bridged or reissued. The real misconception is underestimating how far credibility, transparency, and programmable enforcement can go when composed with intention. With a modular framework like SatLayer, Bitcoin transforms from passive digital gold into an active foundation for a new financial economy — one that’s secure, programmable, and trustless by design.
