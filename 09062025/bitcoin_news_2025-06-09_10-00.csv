2025-06-09T07:43:17,"Nasdaq Adds XRP to Settlement Price Index — How Will XRP Price React?","Key Takeaways: XRP has been added to the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index. Current SEC restrictions prevent Hashdex’s ETF from holding XRP, though a rule change decision is pending. XRP price faces short-term bearish pressure, with key resistance at $2.30 and downside risk toward $2.14. XRP has joined the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, a move that could further open the door to institutional exposure and reshape liquidity across key markets. On June 6, asset manager Hashdex updated its Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), outlining changes to its benchmark. According to the filing, Nasdaq expanded the index on June 2 to include XRP, alongside Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Stellar Lumens (XLM). Previously, the index was limited to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Hashdex’s NCIQ ETF Tracks This Index Hashdex’s ETF, which trades under the ticker NCIQ, tracks this index, providing market-cap weighted exposure to BTC and ETH within a regulated framework. However, current SEC restrictions prevent the ETF from holding any digital assets beyond BTC and ETH, a limitation that may introduce tracking risk now that XRP and others are included in the benchmark. “Under current regulatory restrictions, the Trust is only permitted to hold bitcoin and ether, and is not permitted to hold the new index constituents,” the filing states. “As such, the risk of potential tracking error is increased.” Separately, Nasdaq submitted a proposed rule change in March that would allow the ETF to track the broader Nasdaq Crypto Index (NCI), which already includes XRP, SOL, ADA, XLM, Chainlink (LINK), Litecoin (LTC), and Uniswap (UNI). XRP was officially added to the NCI on June 3, 2024. Should the SEC approve Nasdaq’s rule change, Hashdex’s ETF would be able to hold all NCI constituents — a potential game-changer for XRP’s institutional footprint. A final SEC decision is expected by November 2. Bears Pressure XRP Despite Nasdaq Index Inclusion XRP is trading near $2.22 after a volatile weekend, with technical signals pointing toward bearish momentum in the short term. On the 2-hour chart, XRP faced strong resistance around $2.30 and failed to sustain upward momentum, retreating to the lower Bollinger Band at $2.14. RSI stands at 51.52, indicating neutral momentum but leaning toward overbought after recent rallies. The MACD remains flat, signaling indecision among traders. On the 30-minute chart, XRP shows a sharper downward trend. RSI is at 34.32, approaching oversold territory, while the MACD remains negative, reinforcing near-term bearish pressure. The price has struggled to stay above the $2.25 support, suggesting sellers remain in control. The 1-minute chart confirms short-term weakness, with RSI falling to 32.74 and MACD in negative territory. Buyers are failing to generate sustained volume, with recent bounces quickly sold off. Despite XRP’s inclusion in the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index, institutional flows have yet to lift price action meaningfully. Unless XRP reclaims $2.30 with strong volume, further downside toward $2.14 remains likely. Traders should monitor broader market sentiment and upcoming SEC decisions that could affect institutional access to XRP-based products.

2025-06-09T07:21:31,"Cathie Wood: Bitcoin’s value will multiply 15x in the next five years","Founder and CEO of ARK Investment Management, Cathie Wood believes Bitcoin’s value will reach at least $1.5 million by the time 2030 rolls around, growing by 15x from its current price. In a recent interview on the YouTube channel The Diary of a CEO, Wood breaks down the main reasons why she believes BTC ( BTC )’s value is bound to skyrocket to at least $1.5 million within the next few years. The ARK Investment CEO mentioned several core pillars which make up the “building blocks” of BTC’s growth in the market. One of the major drivers is institutional investments from corporate holders such as Arkham, Strategy and Metaplanet. “Bitcoin is more of an investment because it does appreciate overtime. Now you go through [it], it’s volatile. No question. And that’s the first thing people have to know about it. But it is becoming less volatile as more and more investors hold it,” she said in the interview. According to Wood, a lot of institutional investors have just started to gravitating towards BTC. Therefore, she believes the crypto space will see a flurry of demand from institutional holders who see the appeal of Bitcoin as a new asset class that offers diversification for business portfolios. Wood remarked that the world has not had a new asset class since the 1600s with the introduction of equities. Since then, the global market’s has been occupied by the same traditional assets including stocks , bonds, commodities and real estate . However now, there is a recent shift towards Bitcoin as a desirable asset. “If this asset does not perform like other assets, in other words, it provides diversification for funds. And because it is behaving differently, institutions have to consider it,” said Wood.

Whereas they have trillions of dollars under management,” said Wood. “And so we think there will be a lot of incremental demand, and to satisfy a lot of that demand. Someone’s going to have to sell,” she continued. Institutional appetite for Bitcoin Wood’s statement indicates a wider trend among institutional investors which are just now discovering the advantages of holding Bitcoin. Back in May, Matrixport analysts found that unlike previous bull markets, the rally that raised BTC to a new all-time high of $111,814 was mostly driven by institutional demand, instead of the retail investors. This means that more institutional investors such as major companies and financial management firms are crowding the market now more than ever before. In fact, at least 61 corporate treasuries currently hold a combined 3.2% of the total BTC supply according to Standard Chartered’s Bitcoin report. Most recently, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet announced its plans to acquire 210,000 BTC by 2027, aiming to own 1% of the total supply of global BTC. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s Strategy remains the largest corporate holder of BTC, possessing 580,955 BTC as of June 9, holding around 2.7% of the total Bitcoin supply. As previously reported by crypto.news, ARK Invest recently upped its Bitcoin price forecast in the firm’s April report to $2.4 million by 2030 if its on-chain financial services grow at a 60% annual rate.

2025-06-09T07:18:40,"Blockchain Group Taps TOBAM for $342M Capital Raise to Boost Bitcoin Holdings","Blockchain Group, listed on Euronext Growth Paris, on Monday announced a $342m capital raise in partnership with asset manager TOBAM, aiming to expand its Bitcoin reserves and solidify its position as Europe’s first dedicated Bitcoin Treasury Company. The company will issue new shares through a structure similar to an “at-the-market” program, widely used in the US. TOBAM will subscribe to shares at the market price, with each tranche capped at 21% of the previous day’s trading volume. The offering is designed to gradually increase the number of bitcoins held per share on a fully diluted basis, reinforcing Blockchain Group’s Bitcoin-first balance sheet strategy. TOBAM Could Overtake Fulgur Ventures and Adam Back in Shareholding Under the arrangement, TOBAM will consolidate its weekly requests, and Blockchain Group will publish the total number of shares issued and the Bitcoin purchases made from each round. The Blockchain Group Launches a €300 Million “ATM-type” Capital Increases Program with TOBAM Full Press Release (EN): https://t.co/DbXXbb6OT8 Full Press Release (FR): https://t.co/XbaTfaOqfn BTC Strategy (EN): https://t.co/EiVKw8s4zB pic.twitter.com/dZQCIckgK8 — The Blockchain Group (@_ALTBG) June 9, 2025 TOBAM, an early institutional supporter of Bitcoin since 2017, is participating in the deal. However, it is not acting as a financial intermediary and will not receive a fee. The fund manager retains the option to hold or sell its subscribed shares. If TOBAM takes up its full allocation and chooses to retain the shares, it could own over 39% of Blockchain Group’s capital. That would make it the company’s largest single shareholder. Currently, Blockchain Group’s investor base includes notable names like cryptographer Adam Back and venture firm Fulgur Ventures. Source: The Blockchain Group Blockchain Group Ramps Up Bitcoin Strategy After $68.6M BTC Buy The announcement follows Blockchain Group’s $68.6m purchase of 624 Bitcoins last week, accelerating its expansion into digital assets. This acquisition brought the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 1,437, now valued at more than $150m. It also marked one of the largest Bitcoin treasury allocations by a publicly traded firm in Europe. The move follows a shareholder resolution passed in February. That resolution approved capital raises targeting strategic investors in areas like Web3 and AI. Now, a second resolution under review could raise the limit from $40.4m to $538.5m. If passed, it would give the board greater flexibility to extend the program. Amid rising inflation and broader economic uncertainty, firms are rethinking traditional treasury models. Against that backdrop, Blockchain Group’s aggressive shift toward Bitcoin reflects growing institutional belief in the asset as a long-term store of value.

2025-06-09T07:15:46,"Michael Saylor dismissed claims on the threat posed by quantum computers to virtual currencies","Michael Saylor, executive chairman of Strategy, has expressed his views on the potential threat quantum computing poses to cryptocurrencies. He described the concerns as partly a marketing tactic by those promoting new quantum concept tokens. Saylor believes that major firms like Google and Microsoft would not support the development of quantum computers that could break modern encryption. He argued that such developments could undermine the security of their systems and operations. Saylor expects Bitcoin to counter quantum threat with software upgrades NEW‼️- ARE YOU WORRIED QUANTUM COMPUTING WILL BREAK BITCOIN? 💥 MICHAEL SAYLOR: pic.twitter.com/CVeFWXML4H — Neil Jacobs (@NeilJacobs) June 6, 2025 BlackRock considers Quantum computers, with their ability to outperform classical binary computers and break traditional encryption, a threat to crypto. Michael Saylor dismissed Quantum’s threat to Bitcoin, saying that the BTC protocol would implement a software upgrade when the threat becomes imminent. Saylor responded to concerns about the threat of computers soon being able to break the encryption that enables the scarcity of Bitcoin. He also believes that major tech companies can’t sell to customers a computer that can breach BTC’s cryptography because it would destroy them and the entire banking industry. “It’s mainly marketing from people that want to sell you the next quantum yo-yo token. Google and Microsoft aren’t going to sell you a computer that cracks modern cryptography because it would destroy Google and Microsoft – and the U.S. Government and the banking system.” -Michael Saylor, CEO at Strategy. The quantum sector has had several proposals about how to secure Proof of Work against the quantum threat, including from BTQ Technologies, a startup building quantum-proof crypto hardware. One BTC developer has also introduced a draft Bitcoin Improvement Protocol that proposes a hard fork to move everyone’s wallets to quantum-secure addresses. Saylor argued that the bigger security threat for Bitcoin is phishing, noting that the digital asset is a protocol that gets upgraded yearly. Presto Research also acknowledged in a recent report that the crypto industry is unprepared for the coming quantum threat. Google also suggested in new research that RSA encryption, a critical security feature used in securing Bitcoin, may be more susceptible to quantum computing attacks than previously anticipated. The Quantum AI researcher Craig Gidney, published a new report indicating that RSA encryption could be broken with 20 times fewer quantum resources than previously estimated. He noted that a quantum computer could theoretically break the 2048-bit RSA encryption with 1 million qubits running for one week. Gidney did not mention digital assets, although the Elliptic Curve Cryptographic algorithm, which secures transactions on BTC with public and private keys, is similar in principle to the RSA. A previous study also suggested that despite Elliptic Curve Cryptography being secure against classical computers, a strong enough quantum computer could effectively crack it in the years to come. Google’s latest next-generation quantum chip, Willow, has also ignited concerns over Bitcoin’s cryptography. The firm said the chip could solve a standard benchmark computation in under five minutes, a task that would take the world’s fastest supercomputers 10 septillions years to solve. Hunter wants the BTC community to focus on preparedness rather than denial A study led by the University of Kent’s School of Computing suggested that BTC might need to undergo a costly and time-consuming update process to counter the threat of quantum computing in the future. CTO and co-founder of self-custody service Casa, Jameson Lopp, also argued that Bitcoin’s community has less than a decade to implement contingency plans. According to a study published by Deloitte, 25% of BTC’s circulating supply is vulnerable to quantum attacks because their associated wallets’ keys have been exposed. The firm also found that the sum totaling 4 million Bitcoin at the time is worth nearly $42 billion, based on current prices. Anduro Senior Protocol Engineer Hunter Beast and Marathon Director of Engineering Michael B. Casey suggested that Bitcoin’s algorithms could be cracked with zero warning. The experts also argued that attackers would get far less in the case of a breach. They believe that if BTC’s algorithms are cracked, it could immediately depress the asset’s price during a liquidation event. Beast and Casey acknowledged that Bitcoin can be secured against quantum threats by moving funds to a wallet that hasn’t had its public key exposed yet. They also noted it could be impossible for actors that have lost their keys or impractical for exchanges that let the public make on-chain deposits. Beast emphasized that the community should lean towards preparedness instead of denial.

2025-06-09T07:04:25,"Analyst Says Bitcoin Has ‘Pretty Good’ Chance of Hitting Massive Price Target in 2026, Citing Three Technical Signals","An analyst known for making timely Bitcoin calls believes that BTC will surge to an astronomical price level next year based on three technical signals. In a new strategy session, pseudonymous analyst Cheds tells his 49,700 YouTube subscribers that Bitcoin looks strong on the weekly chart after breaking out from a cup-and-handle pattern. In technical analysis, a cup-and-handle pattern is a bullish continuation structure indicating that an asset is primed to move higher after a period of consolidation. The second bullish signal, according to Cheds, is that the uptrend appears technically sound based on how much time Bitcoin spent forming a solid base between $16,000 and $70,000. And third, the trader says the depth of the consolidation range in the last three years is likely enough to sustain rallies above $200,000 in 2026. “It’s still my base case, and this is just a very general outline. I think we have a pretty good chance of mid-$250,000 in 2026. That seems kind of aggressive, I know. But the funny thing is that this has been a conservative target for some people because people are talking about [hitting $250,000] this year. Absolutely not. That’s crazy… There is zero chance of $250,000 this year, but I think it’s a decent chance of mid-$250,000 just based on the height of the cup-and-handle [pattern], and the time interval and the consolidation range… That’s still my general idea, just based on the weekly trajectory.” Source: Cheds/YouTube At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $105,706.

2025-06-09T07:00:49,"Bitcoin Price Risks Crash To $31,000 Amid 5-Wave Impulse Completion","Over the last few weeks, the Bitcoin price has been on an upward trajectory, propelled forward mainly by institutional adoption and buying. This has seen the Bitcoin price rally to new all-time highs at $111,900, and has remained above $100,000 despite a turn in market sentiment toward the negative. However, this support has not bolstered confidence, with one analyst predicting that the leading cryptocurrency has seen the end of this bull cycle. Bitcoin Price Completes Elliot Wave Theory The Elliot Wave Theory is a chart pattern that has been widely used as Bitcoin has become more mainstream in an effort to predict where the price may be headed next. The theory consists of five full waves, at the end of which lies a bearish trend for the digital asset. So far, the Bitcoin price has been moving through different waves according to different analysts. But Sniper Academy on the TradingView platform has revealed that the five waves have been completed. Related Reading: Ethereum Head & Shoulders Pattern Breakdown: Can Bulls Reclaim Control? Using the 1-month Bitcoin price chart, the crypto analyst shows that there have been five different waves completed. The latest all-time high peak above $111,900 is shown to have been the fifth and final wave, suggesting that this bullish impulse is complete. Given that the Bitcoin price has now completed this theory, the crypto analyst explains that this means that the cryptocurrency has now hit the upper boundary of a long-term ascending channel. Simply put, this is very bearish for the digital asset as this means an end to its upward trajectory. Right now, the analyst showed that the Bitcoin price is already forming divergence after the completion of the fifth wave. This has triggered a weakness in the momentum and has come as a result of resistance forming between $76,000 and $111,000. This trend shows that a potential double top has been created, and that means that there is nowhere for the Bitcoin price to go now but down. BTC Price Targets $31,000 Bottom Given the fact that the crypto analyst believes that the Elliot Wave Theory has played out and the five waves have been completed, the next expectation is a sharp drop in the Bitcoin price. The first move is expected toward $66,000, which would be an almost 50% decline in price from here. Related Reading: Dogecoin’s Growth Pattern Hints At Massive June–July Rally After 5-Month Pullback However, this is not the worst of it, as the crypto analyst sees the cryptocurrency still breaking down to $53,000. Then, if this level does fail to hold, then a fall all the way down to as low as $31,000, serving as the bottom of the channel. This also coincides with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. Once the Bitcoin price is back at $31,000, the crypto analyst believes that accumulation would begin at this key zone. This will then serve as the important level that will drive the start of the next major bull cycle.

An Experienced Analyst Shares His Insights","Cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe made remarkable statements regarding the question “when is the altcoin season?” which is frequently asked by investors. Van de Poppe said that the current cycle is quite different from previous years and that investor psychology is one of the most important determinants of this process. According to Van de Poppe, the term altcoin season has a much deeper meaning than it seems on the surface. “If you enter the market as an investor during the altcoin season, you are probably missing out on the biggest profit opportunities,” the analyst said, arguing that the real profits are made by those who take positions at the lowest levels of the market. Van de Poppe reminded that there was a memecoin craze throughout 2024, but many altcoins lost value. The analyst said that the first quarter of 2025 was also quite weak for altcoins, and that this process exhausted the patience of investors. Related News: Experienced Analyst Reveals 4 Essential Conditions for the Mega Altcoin Season Van de Poppe stated that there are two main views in the current market, one group arguing that we are still in a bear market, while the other group believes that we are at the beginning of a bull market. He stated that this separation has led many investors to take the wrong position. According to the analyst, the current weak performance of altcoins against Bitcoin, central banks signaling changes in their monetary policies, and fundamental advances in areas such as DeFi may be harbingers of a transformation. The absence of altcoin season signals is thought-provoking, according to Van de Poppe. “The market bottom is usually the point where people are most insecure. But that’s when the biggest gains are made in the long run,” said the analyst, arguing that investors who see this period as an opportunity should be patient. *This is not investment advice.

By the close of Friday, June 6, gold had fallen to $3,309.998, marking a 2.21% drop from Monday’s close. Notably, in just the last two days of the week, the gold price slipped by 1.92%, intensifying concerns of a short-term bearish trend. Van de Poppe highlighted this movement in a recent post, suggesting that the late-week drop may confirm the beginning of a broader short-term downtrend. Investors May Shift from Gold to Crypto The analyst points out that continued weakness in gold could lead investors to reallocate capital toward risk-on assets. In today’s market landscape, crypto is increasingly becoming the preferred choice for such investments. A decline in gold prices often reflects reduced demand for safe-haven assets, prompting investors to seek higher returns in more volatile sectors like digital assets. Possible Catalyst Behind Gold’s Downtrend While the exact reason for gold’s recent decline remains unclear, analysts, including van de Poppe, suspect it may be linked to speculation around leadership changes at the U.S. Federal Reserve . Reports suggest that the White House, under President Donald Trump, may be considering replacing Fed Chair Jerome Powell with former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh. If true, this development could have wide-ranging effects on market sentiment and monetary policy, indirectly influencing gold prices. Gold Price Forecast: Critical Levels to Watch Van de Poppe predicts that if gold fails to reclaim the $3,365 level in the short term, the market could face a further decline of 4% to 10% over the next few weeks. Conversely, a strong rebound above this level could open the door to new all-time highs for the yellow metal. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : US-China Trade Talks Begin Today — Will Bitcoin and Ethereum React? , Crypto Market Shows Signs of Strength While the broader cryptocurrency market saw a 4% decline earlier in the week, it staged a recovery by week’s end. On Friday, the market posted a 2.49% gain. Over the weekend, the total crypto market cap increased from $3.21 trillion to $3.26 trillion, reflecting a 1.59% rise. This suggests that some investors may already be reallocating funds from gold into cryptocurrencies in response to market shifts. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Gold and Crypto As uncertainty looms over the Federal Reserve’s leadership and macroeconomic conditions remain volatile, both gold and crypto markets are at a turning point. Should gold continue its downtrend, cryptocurrencies could benefit from increased inflows. Investors and analysts alike will be closely monitoring price action this week to assess whether this rotation gains further momentum. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Gold’s recent decline is linked to speculation about U.S. Federal Reserve leadership changes and a potential shift in investor sentiment from “risk-off” to “risk-on” assets. How might gold’s performance impact the broader market? A sustained downtrend in gold could signal reduced demand for safe-haven assets, potentially redirecting significant liquidity into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. How is gold’s performance connected to the crypto market? As gold weakens, investors may move capital from gold (risk-off) to crypto (risk-on) seeking higher returns, creating an inverse relationship between the two. Is it better to invest in gold or Bitcoin right now?

2025-06-09T06:29:55,"CEX Spot Volumes Drop to 2020 Lows as Market Shifts into HODL Mode: CryptoQuant Analyst","Spot trading activity on centralized exchanges (CEX) has dropped to levels last seen in Oct. 2020, according to data shared by CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr on Monday. The sharp decline reflects a broader market shift, with fewer coins being sold or moved on-chain as crypto investors choose to hold their assets rather than actively trade. Musk and Trump Stir Market Turbulence The slowdown in activity follows a volatile week marked by macroeconomic uncertainty and high-profile social media moments. Bitcoin remained largely range-bound until midweek, when volatility spiked following a fallout between Elon Musk and Donald Trump that caught the market’s attention . The average spot trading volume on CEXs has dropped to October 2020 levels. Coins are not being sold on spot or moved on-chain – the market has shifted into HODL mode. pic.twitter.com/9bl1PejBVD — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) June 9, 2025 The public clash between Donald Trump and Elon Musk injected a fresh wave of uncertainty into the crypto market. Both figures hold outsized influence over investor sentiment, particularly within tech and digital asset circles. Their dispute unsettled markets, contributing to volatility across asset classes. Tesla shares saw a historic drop, while traders braced for potential shifts in policy direction and regulatory tone. Sentiment was further shaken ahead of the release of the US Non-Farm Payrolls report . While BTC briefly dropped by 5%, it quickly recovered on the back of stronger-than-expected labor market data. Traders Pull Back as Risk Aversion Grows and Sell-Side Imbalance Builds Despite the rebound, market signals remain cautious. According to Hyblock Capital, orderbook data shows a growing bearish skew. The bid-ask ratio has turned negative across spot, perpetual futures, and combined exchange platforms, meaning more sellers are placing limit orders near the current price than buyers. Historically, this pattern has preceded local tops and short-term declines in Bitcoin’s price. A key factor behind the drop in CEX volumes is investor risk aversion. Following years of turbulence, from the collapse of FTX in 2022 to regulatory crackdowns on Binance and Coinbase in 2023, traders have become more cautious. Many have chosen to move assets off exchanges and into long-term storage. With DEX Adoption Rising, CEX Face Ongoing Outflows Adding to the shift is the rise of decentralized exchanges. In May 2025, DEXs claimed a record 25% share of global spot trading volume, up from 20% earlier in the year. The jump reflects both improved wallet usability and growing dissatisfaction with centralized platforms. Permissionless access and composable trading environments have made DEXs increasingly attractive to more experienced users. Analysts say this “HODL mode” is unlikely to reverse without a material change in sentiment or stronger market catalysts. Liquidity clusters are now forming around the $107,000 level, while a key support zone remains below, potentially acting as a magnet for price if bearish pressure builds. For now, low activity and rising caution define the landscape. With volatility simmering just beneath the surface, traders appear more inclined to watch from the sidelines than to chase short-term gains.

2025-06-09T06:14:06,"Global Crime Wave Forces Bitcoin Family to Go Underground","Despite the growing global concerns about kidnappings and assaults linked to digital assets, major players like Strategy continue to aggressively accumulate Bitcoin. In fact, Michael Saylor hinted at another purchase after a recent $1 billion stock offering. Meanwhile, the crypto community is pressuring Elon Musk to fully embrace Bitcoin as tensions grow between him and Donald Trump. Bitcoin Family Overhauls Security Didi Taihuttu, the patriarch of the well-known “Bitcoin Family,” implemented a sweeping overhaul of his digital asset security measures in response to the growing wave of violent crimes targeting cryptocurrency holders. The Taihuttu family famously committed to an all-Bitcoin lifestyle in 2017, and took drastic steps to safeguard their crypto assets by spreading their private key information across four continents. In a recent interview with CNBC, Taihuttu revealed that the family no longer relies solely on hardware wallets. Instead, they now employ a hybrid security model that includes blockchain-based storage systems and physically distributed components of their seed phrases. Bitcoin Family According to Taihuttu, their seed phrase has been encrypted, divided into four parts, and stored using a combination of fireproof metal plates and blockchain solutions. These plates are hidden in undisclosed physical locations worldwide. To strengthen the setup even more, Taihuttu altered some of the words in the seed phrase. This means that even if someone were to obtain part of it, they wouldn’t be able to access the assets without knowing the correct contextual modifications. He also pointed out that even under coercion, he could not give away more than what is immediately accessible on his phone or wallet, which contains only a small portion of their holdings. (Source: CNBC ) The shift in strategy happened due to a surge in crypto-linked crimes. Over the past few months, there has been a disturbing increase in kidnappings, extortion, and violent assaults on crypto users around the world. Taihuttu and his family chose to stop posting real-time updates of their travels due to safety concerns, as threats from individuals who tracked their movements online became too serious to ignore. Although the family continues to live a global, nomadic lifestyle, they now take better precautions to shield their movements and protect their digital wealth. Under their new model, about 65% of the family’s crypto assets are secured in cold storage, while their hot wallets, which are used for trading and daily expenses, are guarded using multisignature protocols. Between late 2024 and early 2025, several high-profile cases made headlines across the globe, including a January conviction of gang members in the UK for kidnapping and torturing a crypto investor. There was also a February case in Chicago where six men abducted a family and demanded $15 million in digital assets. In March, popular streamer Kaitlyn Siragusa, who is known online as “Amouranth,” endured a terrifying home invasion where armed intruders demanded crypto transfers. One of the most alarming incidents occurred on May 13 in Paris, when three masked men tried to kidnap the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium. Noizat’s daughter bravely resisted the attackers, and even managed to disarm one of them before bystanders intervened. Strategy Signals New Bitcoin Buy Despite this very concerning rise in crypto-targeted crimes, people and companies are still accumulating Bitcoin. Michael Saylor, the co-founder and executive chairman of Strategy, caused speculation of another major Bitcoin purchase after posting a cryptic message, “Send more Orange,” on X on June 8. Saylor is known for teasing Bitcoin acquisitions through posts like these, and if history repeats, Strategy could soon announce another buy. The timing follows Strategy’s recent acquisition of 705 BTC between May 26 and June 1 for approximately $75 million at an average price of $106,495 per coin. This brought the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 580,955 BTC, which is valued at roughly $61.4 billion. According to SaylorTracker , the firm is currently sitting on an unrealized profit of about $20.6 billion. This is a 50% gain on its Bitcoin investment. Strategy’s aggressive accumulation continues to be fueled by capital raises, with the latest being a $1 billion stock offering . This greatly expands on its initial $250 million raise and is aimed at financing even more Bitcoin purchases as well as general corporate needs. The new offering includes 11.76 million shares of its 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock, priced at $85 each. After expenses, the company expects to net approximately $979 million. The preferred shares feature non-cumulative 10% dividends, appealing to institutional investors seeking yield while giving Strategy predictable financing to deepen its Bitcoin exposure. The company’s bold approach makes it the largest known Bitcoin holder in the world, surpassing even the combined Bitcoin reserves of the United States and China. Strategy’s holdings are nearly 12 times bigger than those of the second-largest public Bitcoin holder, mining firm Mara Holdings. As a result, many investors now see Strategy as a de facto Bitcoin ETF alternative that offers direct exposure to the asset through corporate equity. Elon Musk Pressured to Go All In on Bitcoin Members of the Bitcoin community are also urging Tesla CEO Elon Musk to go all in on Bitcoin as tensions escalate between Musk and US President Donald Trump. The public feud became a lightning rod for crypto advocates, who see it as an opportunity for Musk to strike back by embracing Bitcoin more aggressively. Crypto analyst Will Clemente posted on X that “the best way for Elon to get back at Trump is by full porting Bitcoin.” JAN3 CEO Samson Mow directly called on Musk to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy and resume accepting BTC for Tesla purchases. Mow also suggested that Musk’s space venture, SpaceX, offer launch discounts to customers who pay in Bitcoin. He said that it’s time to “force a hard money standard on the money printers.” This follows his criticism of Trump for failing to follow through after signing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve executive order. He also pointed out that the US has yet to acquire more Bitcoin and risks falling behind other nations. Mow even warned Musk to act before facing potential financial restrictions, and suggested that “at least do it before they freeze your fiat assets.” Others in the crypto space speculated that if Musk truly committed to Bitcoin, it would be on a massive scale. Boyd Cohen , CEO of Lomob, said Musk would likely pursue the biggest BTC treasury in the world and integrate Bitcoin across all his companies. He added that Musk could emerge as a leading global advocate for Bitcoin. The backdrop to this renewed push for Musk’s Bitcoin alignment is a growing personal and political rift with Trump. Their feud reignited after Musk publicly criticized Trump’s tax bill on June 3 by calling it a “disgusting abomination,” and intensified when Musk warned that Trump’s proposed global tariffs could trigger a recession later this year. In response, Trump claimed that canceling Musk’s federal subsidies and contracts could save the government billions of dollars. Musk has long shown interest in cryptocurrency,and recently announced that X will roll out XChats , a messaging feature with “Bitcoin-style encryption.” Although Tesla discontinued Bitcoin payments in 2021 due to environmental concerns, the company still holds digital assets, though the value of its holdings fell from $1.076 billion to $951 million in the first quarter of this year.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9484/global-crime-wave-forces-bitcoin-family-to-go-underground,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

US-China Trade Battle The trade war between the US and China started earlier this year when President Trump raised taxes on products from China by 125% . China fought back with higher taxes on US products, and tensions between the two countries kept growing. At one point, trade tariffs climbed as high as 145%, creating massive uncertainty for businesses and financial markets worldwide. Perhaps, in May, a temporary truce was reached in Switzerland, with the US reducing tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% and China slashing its tariffs to 10%. Trade’s Impact On Crypto Market While all eyes are on these talks, crypto experts have a special reason to watch. In past trade disputes, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have acted as a haven when markets felt shaky. If Monday’s talks go well and the US and China agree to ease trade tensions, it could calm investors and lead to more stable crypto prices. But if talks collapse or tariffs rise again, Bitcoin and altcoins might see a surge as people look for assets that aren’t tied to governments or global politics. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Trump Coin & Tesla Stock Crash Big Amid Elon Musk & Donald Trump Feud: Here’s What’s Next! , Sentiment Shifting Towards Crypto On top of that, data from Santiment shows that more people are buying crypto than ever.

2025-06-09T06:01:00,"Top crypto price predictions: Quant, Bonk, Hedera Hashgraph","Crypto prices held steady on Monday morning as investors eyed the upcoming US and China trade talks and the US consumer inflation data. Bitcoin price was trading at $105,500, while the market capitalization of all tokens stood at $3.3 trillion. This article provides a forecast for top tokens like Quant (QNT), Bonk (BONK), and Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR). Quant price forecast QNT price chart | Source: TradingView Quant is a top cryptocurrency project that aims to provide institutions with the technology they need in building programmable money. It recently came into the spotlight after being selected as a participant in the digital euro project. Quant is also used by top companies like Oracle and Hitachi that deploy its Overledger solution. Overledger allows these companies to build tools that are interoperable across multiple blockchains. The daily chart shows that the Quant token price has been in a strong rally in the past few months, moving from $58 in April to $118 today. It is hovering at its highest point since January 18 this year. Quant token remains above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), a sign that bulls are in control. Oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD continue rising. Quant price is attempting to move above the key resistance level at $119.55, a move that will invalidate the forming double-top patter, whose neckline is at $103.25. A double-top is one of the most bearish chart patterns in technical analysis. QNT token has also moved above the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level. Therefore, moving above that level will point to more gains, potentially to the psychological point at $150. A move below the support at $103.25 will invalidate the bullish outlook. Read more: Ethereum price prediction: 4 charts that point to a surge to $4k Bonk price technical analysis Bonk price chart | Source: TradingView The Bonk token price has crashed in the past few weeks, moving from a high of $0.00002575 in May to $0.00001554 today. This retreat happened after the token formed a double-top pattern at $0.00002575. It has now moved below the neckline point at $0.00001830. Bonk price has also plunged below the 50-day and 100-day EMAs, which have formed a mini death cross pattern. It has also formed a small bearish flag pattern, a common continuation sign. Therefore, the token will likely continue falling as sellers target the key psychological point at $0.000010. The bearish outlook will become invalid if the Bonk price rises above the key resistance level at $0.00001830. Hedera price analysis HBAR price chart | Source: TradingView Hedera Hashgraph’s HBAR token has been in a strong downtrend in the past few months, moving from a high of $0.40 in January to $0.1687 today. This plunge coincided with the ongoing decline in the supply of stablecoins on its network, a sign that activity is falling. The supply has dropped to $80 million from $180 million earlier last month. HBAR price remains below the descending trendline that connects the highest swings since January. It has also remained below the 50-day and 100-day EMA and the support at $0.1705. Hedera Hashgraph price will likely continue falling, with the next target being at $0.1250, its lowest point on April 7. A move above the resistance at $0.1895 will invalidate the bearish view.

2025-06-09T05:54:38,"Binance Proof-of-Reserves Highlights Investor Move from BTC to ETH","The post Binance Proof-of-Reserves Highlights Investor Move from BTC to ETH appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Binance has released its 31st Proof-of-Reserves (PoR) snapshot as of June 1, showing minor shifts in user holdings across top assets. The numbers reflect routine market adjustments but offer a pulse on investor sentiment heading into mid-2025. BTC Down, ETH Up, USDT Slightly Lower According to the report, Binance users now collectively hold 593,000 BTC, representing a 1.82% drop from May 1. In contrast, Ethereum holdings have risen by 1.05% to 5.337 million ETH, signaling slight investor confidence in ETH despite recent market turbulence. USDT balances saw a mild dip of 0.77%, now totaling 28.83 billion, marking a decline of $223 million over the past month. These figures come amid market fluctuations and ongoing demand for transparency from major exchanges. Binance remains the second-largest crypto reserve holder globally, with approximately $110 billion across BTC, ETH, USDT, and USDC. Coinbase still leads the pack with $129 billion under custody, as noted in earlier reports. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple Launches Japan-Focused Web3 Program Backed by JETRO , BNB Dips Below $650 Post-Report Following the update, Binance’s native token BNB slipped below $650, currently trading at $649.89, despite posting a modest 0.15% gain over 24 hours. The price dip suggests investors are digesting the report with caution, even though Binance continues to show strong reserve backing. PoR Continues to Anchor Trust This update is part of Binance’s ongoing push to reinforce transparency and user confidence after a turbulent period for the industry. Though no major red flags surfaced, these numbers will be closely watched as regulatory scrutiny intensifies and trading activity picks up for the second half of the year. Binance’s consistency in publishing PoR reports shows a clear intent to stay ahead on trust, something traders and regulators alike are paying close attention to. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Pavel, what first pulled you into crypto? And how did you become such an early builder and investor specifically within Telegram’s blockchain ecosystem? It was Bitcoin in early 2017 that first pulled me into crypto, but what truly captured my interest was the underlying technology. That curiosity led me to follow Telegram’s blockchain efforts from the early days of the GRAM ICO in 2018. I’ve been tracking it closely ever since. In 2022, I invested in TON, driven by the conviction that its deep integration with Telegram could unlock massive potential. I dove deeper into the ecosystem, and soon began contributing, starting with the launch of the first liquid staking platform on TON in early 2023. That experience paved the way for our next chapter: building TAC. It’s been a natural evolution of our belief in TON and its future as a core part of the Telegram ecosystem. 2.

2025-06-09T05:46:46,"Cryptocurrency Presale of the Year: Bitcoin Solaris Offers Early Investors 233% Returns Before Becoming the Next Bitcoin","The post Cryptocurrency Presale of the Year: Bitcoin Solaris Offers Early Investors 233% Returns Before Becoming the Next Bitcoin appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Every few years, crypto history repeats itself. A low-priced token appears out of nowhere, gathers a loyal following, and then explodes, creating millionaires in the process. It happened with Bitcoin. It happened with Ethereum. And now, many believe it’s happening again, with a newcomer that might just be the smartest blockchain upgrade we’ve seen: Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S). While the price is still in presale, early investors are already calculating a jaw-dropping 233% return before the token even hits exchanges. Can Bitcoin’s Original Vision Still Compete? Bitcoin is a legend—and rightly so. It introduced the world to decentralized money and a fixed-supply model that revolutionized finance. But despite its strength as digital gold, Bitcoin’s limitations are clear: slow transaction speeds, minimal scalability, and no built-in support for smart contracts. In contrast, Bitcoin Solaris takes that core legacy and injects it with 2025-grade innovation, delivering not just security and scarcity but speed, programmability, and broad usability. The Powerhouse Behind Bitcoin Solaris’s Rise At its heart, Bitcoin Solaris is built for one thing: evolution. It doesn’t aim to replace Bitcoin—it aims to finish what it started. The network uses a dual-layer architecture to solve the trilemma of decentralization, scalability, and speed. The Base Layer runs on SHA-256, the same algorithm that powers Bitcoin, and supports standard mining hardware with a 5-minute block time. Above it, the Solaris Layer operates using Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)—featuring 21 rotating validators, dynamic 32MB blocks, and 15-second confirmations. Together, these layers achieve over 10,000 TPS while staying energy-efficient and secure. And that’s not all. Validator elections, slashing mechanisms, and synchronization between layers ensure stability and fairness across the board. While traditional chains struggle with either speed or security, Bitcoin Solaris bridges both with technical mastery. The Future of Decentralization Is Already Mining—Start with BTC-S Why the Presale Is Gaining Serious Momentum With less than 8 weeks left before its official launch, the Bitcoin Solaris presale is turning heads fast: Current Price: $6 Next Phase: $7 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 10% Over 11,000 users have already joined the presale, and more than $3 million has been raised. This makes it one of the shortest and most explosive presales in recent memory. Investors are chasing a projected 1,900% return, and today marks the final day of Phase 6. The clock is ticking. In a recent in-depth review, Ben Crypto highlighted why so many crypto enthusiasts are calling this the presale of the year, diving into both the scalability and security features that set BTC-S apart. Smart Contracts That Actually Do Something While many chains talk about smart contracts , Bitcoin Solaris builds them for the real world. Rust-based contracts bring enterprise-grade flexibility to the network. DeFi lending, borrowing, tokenized real estate, play-to-earn economies, supply chain tracking—BTC-S supports them all from day one. Here’s what makes it truly special: Rust-based contracts, deployed using Solana’s toolset for seamless developer adoption Cross-chain bridges to connect with Ethereum, Solana, and others Near-instant finality with 2-second confirmation speeds Application support spanning DeFi, gaming, IoT, healthcare, education, and digital identity. The Hidden Wealth Engine Here’s where Bitcoin Solaris really earns its title as the next Bitcoin: mining. But not as you know it. Two-thirds of BTC-S (66.67%) is allocated to mining rewards over time. Mining requires users to hold BTC-S, reducing sell pressure and strengthening long-term value Accessible via desktop, browser, and through the upcoming Solaris Nova app, which is designed for everyday users Unlike traditional systems where whales and server farms dominate, BTC-S distributes opportunity through design. Even holding tokens can power the network and generate returns. It’s a wealth system engineered for mass participation, not just the elite. Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Solaris: What’s Actually Different? Feature Bitcoin Bitcoin Solaris Transaction Speed ~7 TPS 10,000+ TPS Smart Contracts None Full Rust-based support Energy Consumption High 99.95% Lower Validator Governance None On-chain, DPoS validator system Mining Method PoW only PoW + DPoS hybrid Mobile Accessibility None Mining via browser + app Use Case Focus Digital gold Full ecosystem (DeFi, NFTs, etc.) How Bitcoin Solaris Could Make You Rich Bitcoin Solaris isn’t promising overnight riches. It’s offering architecture that rewards smart participation. It’s built with value-holders in mind, not just hype-chasers. With a fixed 21M cap, long-term staking and mining incentives, and a scarcity design straight from Bitcoin’s playbook, it’s not hard to see how early holders could win big. As adoption increases and the ecosystem grows, the upward pressure on BTC-S will come not from marketing—but from function. From holding, using, and participating.

The firm currently holds 580,955 BTC, worth approximately $61.4 billion at current values, according to Bitcoin Treasuries data . Michael Saylor has a history of posting on Sundays before his Bitcoin purchases. However, a recent report from K33 Research revealed that Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, appears to have slowed down its Bitcoin buys. This is due to a declining premium for MSTR shares relative to the company’s Bitcoin holdings, K33 Head of Research Vetle Lunde attributed. ’Strategy Is Fully Torqued Bitcoin’: Michael Saylor On June 7, Saylor posted a victorious message on X, sharing an infographic on how Bitcoin has helped Strategy outperform other major tech titans, including Tesla, Meta and Nvidia. “Strategy is fully torqued Bitcoin,” he wrote on X, with a 126% increase in terms of a year return growth. Strategy is fully torqued Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/Dqu6RKY7b7 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 6, 2025 The posts follow Strategy’s announcement of a $1 billion stock offering , and using the proceeds to fund additional Bitcoin purchases and general corporate expenses. Per the announcement, the company aims to issue 11,764,700 shares of 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock, at a public offering price of $85.00 per share. “Strategy intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin and for working capital,” the announcement read. Bitcoin Treasury Race Heats Up: What Could Be Next? Following Strategy’s lead, there has been an intensifying competition among corporations entering the Bitcoin treasury space. Japan’s Metaplanet, for instance, has been stochpiling Bitcoin continuously, with a new target to accumulate 210,000 BTC by 2027 . The Tokyo-listed investment firm currently holds 8,888 BTC, placing it tenth globally in corporate Bitcoin holdings. Michael Saylor’s Sunday endorsement could signal sustained positive sentiment among traders and potentially increase institutional accumulation.

2025-06-09T05:30:06,"Bitcoin Volatility Ahead? 3 Things That Could Move Crypto Markets This Week","Last week’s weak PMI reports showed manufacturing activity contracting for a third month in a row and services activity shrinking for the first time in 11 months. Additionally, crypto markets have settled a little following the volatility in the wake of the spat between US President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk late last week. However, some of that may return this week when key inflation and consumer sentiment reports are released. On top of this, the next round of US-China trade talks is scheduled to begin on Monday, commented the Kobeissi Letter. Economic Events June 9 to 13 The most impactful report of the week is May’s Consumer Price Index CPI which is one of the two key measures of inflation. Central bank policymakers and investors closely monitor the CPI report as it reflects price trends across the economy and shapes sentiment. The May CPI report is likely to confirm that price pressures remain elevated, according to analysts. May’s Producer Price Index (PPI) report will follow the CPI on Thursday, reflecting input costs for producers and manufacturers. PPI measures the cost of producing consumer goods, which ultimately impacts retail prices, and is viewed as a leading indicator of inflationary pressures. June’s Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index and Consumer Inflation Expectations preliminary readings are due on Friday. These reports summarize consumer confidence and long-term inflation expectations, which can impact spending and overall economic growth. Key Events This Week: 1. Atlanta Fed GDPNow data – Monday 2. May CPI Inflation data – Wednesday 3. 10-Year Note Auction -Wednesday 4. May PPI Inflation data – Thursday 5. Michigan Inflation Expectations data – Friday 6. Michigan Consumer Sentiment data – Friday This marks… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) June 8, 2025 This marks the last week of inflation data before the June Fed meeting. According to the CME Fed Watch tool, there is a 99.9% probability that interest rates will remain unchanged at the June 18 central bank meeting. Crypto Market Outlook Crypto markets have dipped a little over the past 24 hours, with a 2% decline in total capitalization, which dropped to $3.41 trillion during Monday morning trading in Asia. Overall, markets remain range-bound bound having recovered from their Friday fall and holding steady over the weekend. Bitcoin topped $106,000 during late trading on Sunday but declined a little to $105,600 on Monday, June 9. Aside from Friday’s dip, it has remained within this tight trading channel since the end of May. Ethereum is holding steady around the $2,500 price zone, failing to break resistance above $2,700 but also not slumping back towards $2,000. Most of the altcoins are generally flat with minor gains for XRP and ICP, and further losses for memecoins.

2025-06-09T05:00:00,"Coinbase Reduces Account Freezes and Launches DeFi Access for XRP and DOGE","Coinbase is making meaningful changes to improve both user experience and product offerings. The crypto exchange announced the launch of wrapped XRP and Dogecoin on its Layer-2 Base network, giving holders access to decentralized finance (DeFi) opportunities. At the same time, CEO Brian Armstrong reported an 82% reduction in unnecessary account freezes, addressing a long-standing user concern through improved machine learning infrastructure. Coinbase Slashes Account Freezes by 82% Amid Growing User Pressure and Data Breach Fallout Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong says the company has made major strides in solving one of its most persistent and controversial issues: unnecessary user account freezes. In a June 6 post on X, Armstrong revealed that the crypto exchange has successfully reduced such incidents by 82%, attributing the improvement to recent internal changes and new investments in technology. “For longer than is acceptable, account restrictions have been a major pain point for Coinbase users,” Armstrong admitted. “We’ve now made it a top priority to fix it.” He added that the company is continuing to roll out improvements and encouraged users with frozen accounts to contact Coinbase Support directly. For years, Coinbase users have complained about sudden and prolonged account freezes—often without clear explanations. Many said they were locked out of their funds for months, and in some cases, even years. These restrictions led to widespread user dissatisfaction, with some customers abandoning the platform altogether. One X user, responding to Armstrong’s post, claimed they had been locked out for over two years, while another described enduring an eight-month freeze before giving up on Coinbase entirely. A common theme in these accounts is frustration with Coinbase’s customer service infrastructure. “It is extremely hard to speak to a live customer service person,” one user wrote. “It can take forever to track someone down.” This customer service bottleneck has been compounded by another major blow to user trust: a recent data breach that compromised the personal details of over 70,000 Coinbase accounts. Illicit actors reportedly bribed overseas customer support agents to gain access to sensitive information such as government-issued IDs and home addresses. The breach occurred in December 2024 but was only disclosed in mid-May 2025. Machine Learning and Internal Reforms Coinbase credits much of the improvement in account freeze issues to new machine learning models and infrastructure upgrades spearheaded by Dor Levi, a product team member who joined the company just nine weeks ago. In a separate X post, Levi explained that Coinbase had made “significant investments” to enhance the precision and recall of its fraud detection and compliance models. These efforts have directly resulted in fewer account restrictions and false positives. Despite these advancements, both Armstrong and Levi emphasized that Coinbase will continue to impose account restrictions when legally required—such as in response to court orders or government sanctions—to remain in compliance with international laws. Coinbase is also under intense scrutiny following revelations about a major data leak that exposed customer identities. According to reports, bad actors bribed international contractors to access Coinbase’s support systems, allowing them to download ID photos and sensitive contact information. The fallout from this breach has been severe. One user claimed that a family friend lost both Bitcoin and Ether in a scam they believe was connected to the incident. Armstrong previously addressed the breach in a May 15 X post, promising that Coinbase would be “significantly strengthening” its internal controls and agent access protocols. The Stakes Are High With over 100 million registered users, Coinbase remains one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world. It is also the primary custodian for spot Bitcoin ETFs, making its operational integrity a crucial matter not just for individual users but also for institutional investors. The company’s move to fix account freezes could go a long way toward restoring user trust, but only if followed through with consistent action. For now, the 82% reduction is a promising sign, but the platform’s critics are likely to remain skeptical until the remaining 18% of issues are also addressed and security practices are fully overhauled. Coinbase Brings XRP and Dogecoin to DeFi on Base With New Wrapped Tokens In related news, Coinbase , has also taken a major step toward expanding the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem on its Layer-2 blockchain, Base. The company announced last week that wrapped versions of XRP and Dogecoin—cbXRP and cbDOGE—are now live on the Base network, opening the door for millions of token holders to generate yield through DeFi strategies. This development allows holders of the original XRP and DOGE assets to earn returns from decentralized applications (dApps) without having to leave the Coinbase ecosystem. It’s a powerful blend of accessibility, interoperability, and scalability—three key pillars Coinbase has touted as central to Base’s vision since its launch. A New Frontier for XRP and Dogecoin Wrapped tokens are tokenized representations of cryptocurrencies that exist on networks where they are not natively supported. In this case, cbXRP and cbDOGE are ERC-20 compliant tokens on Base, backed 1:1 by their underlying assets, which Coinbase holds in secure custody. This ensures the wrapped tokens are fully collateralized and redeemable. XRP, best known as the payments token powering Ripple’s cross-border settlement rails, and Dogecoin, the meme-born cryptocurrency that has developed a robust following and ecosystem, both historically lacked deep integration with Ethereum-compatible DeFi ecosystems. Base’s introduction of wrapped versions now changes that. Coinbase said the move allows holders to participate in yield farming, liquidity provision, lending, and other DeFi protocols natively available on Base. Importantly, it means users can retain exposure to XRP and DOGE while layering on additional sources of yield. Within just 24 hours of their launch, cbXRP and cbDOGE saw strong market interest. Data from blockchain explorer BaseScan shows that cbXRP surpassed a $5 million market cap, while cbDOGE is approaching the $2 million mark. These rapid inflows suggest significant demand from token holders eager to unlock new use cases beyond simple holding or trading. The adoption of wrapped tokens for DeFi use is not new—Coinbase previously launched wrapped Bitcoin (cbETH and later cbBTC) on Base in September 2024, which has now grown into a major asset on the chain with a market cap of over $4.7 billion. With the success of cbBTC as a precedent, cbXRP and cbDOGE are expected to follow a similar growth trajectory, especially as Base becomes a more attractive hub for DeFi applications and developer activity. Why Base? Launched by Coinbase in early 2023, Base is a Layer-2 network built on the OP Stack, developed by Optimism. The network was created to offer a scalable, low-cost, and developer-friendly alternative to Ethereum’s mainnet while staying compatible with the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Base has been instrumental in Coinbase’s strategy to bridge centralized finance (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). By bringing wrapped assets onto Base, Coinbase is ensuring that even holders of non-EVM-native assets like XRP and DOGE can participate in Web3 without the traditional pain points of complex bridging or high fees. In doing so, Coinbase is also strengthening Base’s positioning against other Layer-2 contenders such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync. For XRP and Dogecoin communities, the move represents a major step forward in utility expansion. While XRP has long been used in traditional financial infrastructure through RippleNet and its ODL (On-Demand Liquidity) product, its availability in DeFi has been limited. Dogecoin, often dismissed as a meme coin, has steadily carved out a real presence in the market, backed by a passionate user base and integration into tipping systems and merchant payments. Its new wrapped version could reinvigorate interest from developers and DeFi projects looking to capture Dogecoin’s broad user appeal. Both tokens now stand to benefit from liquidity pools, lending markets, staking derivatives, and DEX listings that can dramatically increase their functionality and relevance in the current DeFi landscape. The Bigger Picture Coinbase’s continued expansion into wrapped assets and Base integration is part of a broader strategic pivot toward Web3 infrastructure and passive income services. As traditional trading revenues face pressure from competition and regulation, DeFi and on-chain products represent a growth avenue for the exchange. By offering a seamless pathway for retail and institutional users to explore DeFi with familiar assets like XRP, DOGE, and BTC, Coinbase is reducing the technical and psychological friction that has long slowed DeFi’s adoption.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9486/coinbase-reduces-account-freezes-and-launches-de-fi-access-for-xrp-and-doge,"BTC|DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|XRP","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-09T04:54:32,"Coinbase Cuts Account Lockouts by 82% – Can It Finally Win Back Trader Trust?","Coinbase says it has slashed unnecessary account restrictions by 82%, following widespread criticism over long-standing issues that left users locked out of their accounts for weeks or even months. CEO Brian Armstrong acknowledged the issue in a June 6 post on X, calling account freezes a “major issue” that had persisted “for longer than is acceptable.” He said resolving it has become a priority for the company. “The issue has been reduced by 82% so far, with more improvements coming,” Armstrong said. He also encouraged users still affected to contact Coinbase Support. Coinbase Tries to Rebuild Trust After Long-Standing Account Freeze Issues The improvements come after years of frustration among users, some of whom reported being locked out for extended periods with limited ability to reach support. Many cited abrupt freezes with no clear explanation, while others reported abandoning the platform altogether due to poor service and a lack of recourse. Account freezing has been a major issue at Coinbase for longer than is acceptable. I could list a bunch of the underlying reasons why it got so bad in the first place, but what's more important is that we've made it a priority to fix, and we have been making good progress. Shout… https://t.co/Emrq6KQhpD — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) June 6, 2025 These challenges have contributed to eroding user confidence, compounded recently by a data breach that exposed personal details of over 70,000 customers . Armstrong credited the progress to Dor Levi, a recent hire on the Coinbase product team. Levi, who joined nine weeks ago, said the company had invested heavily in upgrading its machine learning models and internal infrastructure. These changes improved the accuracy of automated systems that flag accounts for potential violations, thereby reducing false positives and unnecessary restrictions. System Fixes Continue but Users Say Customer Service Still Falls Short While the company aims to minimize disruptions, Armstrong and Levi noted that some freezes will continue in cases involving legal obligations, sanctions, or fraud prevention. Still, Levi admitted that Coinbase’s handling of account access “doesn’t meet [his] own bar,” and pledged further refinement. The public response remains mixed. In replies to Armstrong’s post, some users said they remain locked out, with one claiming to have been denied access to their account for over two years. Another said they left the exchange after an eight-month freeze. Others complained about difficulty reaching human support, echoing a long-running complaint about customer service delays. The timing of the update follows scrutiny over Coinbase’s handling of a data breach disclosed in May. According to Reuters, attackers bribed overseas support contractors last December to obtain access to sensitive user information, including government-issued ID and home addresses. Exchange Tries to Reset, But Consistency and Transparency Will Be the Real Test So, can Coinbase win back trader trust? The 82% reduction is a meaningful start. However, trust in crypto is hard-won and easily lost. For many retail users who left after prolonged freezes, one announcement is not enough. They need consistent action to believe the change is real. What matters now is whether Coinbase follows through with consistent improvements, transparent communication, and a more responsive support system. As the largest custodian of spot Bitcoin ETFs and a major US exchange with over 100m users, Coinbase has much at stake. The company’s efforts to resolve user pain points are being closely watched, both by retail traders and also by regulators and institutions evaluating the security and reliability of crypto infrastructure.

A new version of the CLARITY Act was recently released , setting the stage for a key markup session this week. The latest draft of the CLARITY Act, known as the Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute (ANS), was recently released. It includes some updates and changes to the original bill. FOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett, in a recent X post, shared that this version is set to be the foundation for Tuesday’s crucial markup session in the House Financial Services Committee. NEW: The Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute (ANS) for the CLARITY Act was posted this evening. The ANS is an updated version of the introduced bill with recent amendments and additions.

There is another version from the House Agriculture Committee, which it will mark up separately. Both committees will review and make changes to their versions on Tuesday. After that, the two versions will be merged into one final bill. Franc Corva shared in an X Post that this update has some good news for crypto developers and wallet providers. It says that developers who don’t control the blockchain will not be treated like money transmitters. Also, DeFi activities and software that help users keep their own private keys won’t be regulated under this act. NEW: Here are three important segments from The Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute (ANS) for the CLARITY Act (H.R. 3633), which was posted this evening.

This gives more freedom to developers and users in the crypto world. The update also adds new banking rules in Section 312(b)-(c) about using digital assets and blockchain. National banks can use digital assets and blockchain to offer any legal services, but they still need to follow existing rules. Insured state banks and their subsidiaries have the same permissions. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : SEC to Hold Roundtable Meeting On 9 June: “Defi and the American Spirit” , The bill mainly tries to clarify how U.S. laws apply to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins .

It provides clarity on the classification of digital assets, the role of regulatory bodies, and what rules companies must follow, which will help build a safer, more predictable space for innovation and growth. Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve Plan Moves to Congress Recently, the U.S. took a big step toward embracing Bitcoin. Rep. Tim Burchett introduced a new bill, H.R. 3798 , to officially turn Trump’s plan for a strategic Bitcoin reserve into law. If passed, the U.S. government would start building its own Bitcoin stash. The bill is now being reviewed by the House Financial Services Committee.

2025-06-09T04:13:58,"MEXC Unveils New Launchpad Featuring BTC to Kick Off BTC Trading Month","BitcoinWorld MEXC Unveils New Launchpad Featuring BTC to Kick Off BTC Trading Month VICTORIA , Seychelles , June 9, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — In a bold move to restore fairness in early-stage token investing, MEXC , a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, has officially launched its new Launchpad. The platform is designed to offer users fair and transparent access to high-quality tokens. By removing barriers to entry and offering discounted subscriptions to premium assets, it gives equal opportunity to all users, regardless of account status, trading volume, or social influence. The first subscription event under this new model will feature Bitcoin (BTC), marking a high-trust starting point and kicking off its BTC Trading Month. While many launchpads promise community access, most have evolved into tiered, opaque systems where venture capitalists, influencers, and VIPs secure favorable allocations — leaving regular users with scraps. MEXC’s new launchpad model challenges this status quo by removing lotteries, VIP tiers, and preferential pools. Instead, it introduces a fully transparent, contribution-based allocation mechanism that puts retail users and large investors on equal footing. “The spirit of launchpads has been lost in recent years,” said Tracy Jin , COO of MEXC. “We’re bringing it back — by making early-stage investing truly community-first again.” Participation in the MEXC Launchpad is open to everyone . Users can directly subscribe to project offerings using USDT or other designated tokens. Allocations are distributed on a purely proportional basis, with simple tasks, point farming, or influencer-driven campaigns involved. There are two primary models available: full subscription, where tokens are allocated directly based on the invested amount, and oversubscription, where allocations are shared proportionally among participants when demand exceeds supply. Building on this structure, participants will also be able to subscribe to tokens at discounted rates below the expected market price, increasing their potential upside. MEXC Launchpad is not limited to early-stage projects; it will also provide access to premium, well-established tokens with strong fundamentals and market appeal. The first subscription event under this new model will feature Bitcoin (BTC), marking a high-trust starting point. The subscription period will run from June 6 to June 20 and includes exclusive offers tailored to different user segments. New users will be able to purchase BTC at a discount of up to 90%, with individual allocations ranging from 5 to 55 USDT, and a total pool capped at 4 BTC. Existing users will receive a 20% discount, with allocation limits set between 25 and 250 USD1 , and a total cap of 3 BTC. To further encourage participation, a referral rewards program offers 5 USDT for each new user referred, up to a maximum of 100 USDT per participant. MEXC Launchpad will focus on selecting high-quality projects, particularly in trending and high-growth sectors such as Real World Assets, AI, and the TON ecosystem. Each project is evaluated in collaboration with MEXC Ventures, which provides further support and funding to help innovative ideas scale. Most significantly, no venture capital or KOL pools exist within MEXC Launchpad. All allocations happen on-chain, using a transparent algorithm based solely on each user’s actual contribution. This removes the structural favoritism that has plagued traditional launchpads. “We believe innovation should be accessible to everyone,” MEXC’s Jin said. “You shouldn’t have to be a whale, influencer, or VC to get early access to good projects. Our goal is to level the playing field and empower all users to access high-quality projects at favorable terms. With the new Launchpad, we’re making it easier for real users to engage with real innovation, without the usual barriers or preferential treatment.” As the crypto market continues to heat up, MEXC Launchpad offers something rare: a chance for everyday users to participate in the next wave of innovation, without being pushed aside by insiders. About MEXC Founded in 2018, MEXC is committed to being “Your Easiest Way to Crypto.” Serving over 40 million users across 170+ countries, MEXC is known for its broad selection of trending tokens, everyday airdrop opportunities, and low trading fees. Our user-friendly platform is designed to support both new traders and experienced investors, offering secure and efficient access to digital assets. MEXC prioritizes simplicity and innovation, making crypto trading more accessible and rewarding.

Michael van de Poppe Says It’s Time to Accumulate appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News With Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency, recently hitting an all-time high of $111,980 and taking over 64.64% of the market, many in the crypto community are starting to wonder: When will the altcoin season finally arrive? Meanwhile, Veteran Crypto expert Michael van de Poppe explained why he thinks the altcoins season is about to start soon. Altcoins Have Been Slow for Years Michael says that altcoins have not been doing well since late 2021. He remembers that the last big altcoin season was in 2017, when almost every altcoin was going up fast. In 2021, older altcoins didn’t do as well as newer tokens. In 2024, most of the hype was about memecoins, not the usual altcoins. He also points out that in the past four years, Bitcoin went as high as $65,000, and during that time, around 95% of altcoin gains were already done. But after that, altcoins kept falling, and many people stopped caring about them. Global Factors Holding Back Altcoins Van de Poppe believes this cycle is different. He says that altcoins are underperforming because we’re still in a “Bitcoin season,” and people are afraid to take risks. When #Altseason ? One of the most asked questions, as people are looking to make a large return, willing to bet everything on it. Altseason hasn't come for a long time, the question is: when will this start to appear?

Michael shares that people are eagerly waiting for altcoin season, asking, “When will it start?” He says there are two types of people right now, some think the market is still in a bear phase, while others believe the next big rise is just beginning. He feels that now is a good time to pick up altcoins. Many of them are priced low and have strong teams. Michael says this is the chance to buy them quietly, before the rest of the world catches on. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-09T03:51:03,"Bitcoin Struggles as Hang Seng Cheers U.S.-China Trade Talks; U.S. Inflation Eyed","Major cryptocurrencies showed little bullish momentum Monday, even as hopes for the U.S.-China trade talks lifted Asian stocks. Bitcoin BTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, traded flat-to-negative near $105,650, having carved out a doji candle, a sign of indecision, on Sunday, according to data source TradingView. Data from Blockchain.com showed a marked slowdown in network activity, with the seven-day moving average of daily on-chain transactions falling to 315.48K, the lowest in at least a year. Payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP XRP struggled to gather upside traction despite topping a bearish trendline from the mid-May highs. The cryptocurrency changed hands at $2.24 at press time, down over 1% on the day (UTC). Volatility may increase this week as the XRP Ledger's APEX 2025 conference kicks off in Singapore. Meme cryptocurrency dogecoin DOGE traded nearly 2% lower, closing in on 18 cents, having failed to establish a foothold above the 100-day simple moving average (SMA) over the weekend. Hang Seng tops 24K Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 1.3%, topping the 24,000 mark for the first time since March 24, according to data source TradingView. The move came in response to the optimism about the U.S.-China trade talks this week. ""Optimism is as high as it's been since Trump's election as top trade deputies will meet in London starting on Monday. There are indications that talks will go all week and Trump himself is optimistic,"" ForexLive's Chief Currency Analyst Adam Button said in a blog post. ""The meeting should go very well,"" President Donald Trump said on Truth Social Friday, announcing the new round of trade talks in London. Other Asian indices, such as South Korea's KOSPI and China's Shanghai Composite, also gained ground despite the deepening consumer and factory gate deflation in China. China's deflation worsens China's consumer prices fell 0.1% year-over-year in May, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics released on Monday. The CPI first turned negative in February. Meanwhile, the producer price index, or factory gate prices, fell 3.3% year-over-year in May, registering a sharper decline than the 3.2% drop analysts had expected. Factory gate prices have been in deflation since October 2022. According to Robin Brooks, senior fellow in the Global Economy and Development program at the Brookings Institution, the U.S. tariffs are generating a deflationary shock for major exporters like China. ""China's producer price inflation for consumer goods is down to its lowest level since the 2008 crisis. U.S. tariffs will now push China into full-on deflation. All necessary conditions for deflation are there: weak consumption and a debt overhang. U.S. tariffs are now the catalyst...,"" Brooks said on X. The worsening deflation could prompt China to stimulate domestic demand with further liquidity easing. China’s central bank in May cut the key interest rates by 10 basis points to a historic low while reducing the reserve requirement ratio, releasing liquidity into the market. Last week, the state-run China Securities Journal reported that the People's Bank of China may lower the reserve requirement ratio further later this year to support growth and restart government bond trading. More Chinese stimulus could bode well for financial markets, including cryptocurrencies. Focus on U.S. CPI The U.S. consumer price index for May due Wednesday will be scrutinized by markets for clues that Trump's tariffs are adding to price pressures in the economy. The headline CPI is seen matching April's pace of 0.2% month-on-month growth, equating to an annualized 2.5% rise versus April's 2.3% increase, according to FXStreet. Meanwhile, the core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy component, is forecast to have ticked higher to 2.9% in May from 2.8% in April. Economists at Barclays expect the data to show first signs of tariffs-related price increases across wide range of core goods. A hotter-than-expected print could dent Fed rate cuts, potentially injecting downside volatility in financial markets.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/09/bitcoin-struggles-as-hopes-for-u-s-china-trade-talks-lift-hang-seng-to-highest-since-march-china-s-deflation-worsens,"ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Markets|Bitcoin|XRP|DOGE|Markets|market analysis|News",cryptocompare
