2025-06-09T01:50:47,"Crypto Market Meltdown: Bitcoin Spikes as Trump-Elon Chaos Hits The Market, Is A Bigger Crash Coming?","With the crypto market in a meltdown, Bitcoin (BTC) is seeing a dramatic spike in volatile price movements ignited by a public feud between US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, even as FloppyPepe (FPPE) emerges as a key focus for investors. The volatility has pulled focus away from traditional assets and cast fresh doubt on Bitcoin’s (BTC) near-term stability, sparking fears of a wider market crash. According to Coinglass , over $967 million in crypto market liquidations have occurred, confirming that bullish traders were caught off guard. The sheer scale of the chaos underscores the crypto market’s volatile nature and its reaction to macro headlines, particularly those stirred by Donald Trump or Elon Musk. Trump vs Musk: The Feud Behind the Bitcoin (BTC) Plunge Donald Trump and Elon Musk have turned the crypto market into their battlefield, igniting a wave of panic selling across Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins. Their explosive exchange sent Bitcoin (BTC) plummeting, shedding nearly 3% and pushing it to retest the crucial $100,000 threshold once more. This political clash has pulled the entire crypto market into chaos. Data shows long liquidations for Bitcoin (BTC) totaled over $345 million, fueling analyst speculation regarding the potential for a bigger crash. With Donald Trump and Elon Musk commanding so much public attention, the fallout continues to weigh on sentiment and market direction.

2025-06-09T01:47:16,"XRP Lawyer urges followers to purchase Bitcoin at $106K","John Deaton, a prominent cryptocurrency lawyer and vocal XRP supporter, is sending a powerful signal to investors: Bitcoin is still a buy — even at $106,000. On social media platform X , Deaton recently sought to explain why he thinks today’s lofty prices carry more opportunity than risks. His approach flies in the face of the notion that one should “buy low.” He makes the case, by contrast, that macro conditions and long-term potential count for more than short-term price tags. Deaton disclosed that 80% of his net worth is in BTC, and his average purchase cost is less than $25,000. Nonetheless, he does not think the current six-figure range is too late. Instead, he says they’re “more asymmetrical,” meaning there’s more upside based on what he deems are more potential gains versus potential losses—despite the more expensive price. He said this in response to Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey’s appeal for people to find some money and purchase BTC today. Deaton also echoed Bailey’s call but cautioned that citizens living paycheck-to-paycheck should not risk their homes or take out loans to spend money to invest in crypto. Regardless, he maintains that Bitcoin is one of the best current stores for value. Deaton’s criticisms are rooted in larger concerns about the global economy. He cited growing national debt levels in the US, the re-imposition of Trump-era tariffs, and endless money printing from central banks as major red signs. In his view, these are gradually undermining confidence in fiat currencies. For Deaton, BTC is the answer. It’s decentralized, with only 21 million coins ever to be produced, and it can’t be manipulated by governments or printed into infinity. “Bitcoin is a hedge against the collapse of fiat,” Deaton said in a podcast interview last month. Institutions and countries are jumping in Another element of Deaton’s argument is the wave of institutional and even state adoption of Bitcoin. Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) is leading the charge. The company has been in the news for its aggressive purchase of BTC. The firm now owns more than 200,000 BTC, the equivalent of tens of billions of dollars, and is adding to its holdings each week. In the last seven days alone,16 companies have been added to an expanding list of businesses incorporating Bitcoin into their corporate treasury. But businesses are not the only ones being buoyed. Governments are also starting to take Bitcoin more seriously. Rep.Tim Burchett introduced a bill in Congress to codify Trump’s executive order into a law that created a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Countries such as Pakistan, Ukraine, and Ireland are also eyeing similar proposals and exploring the possibility of utilizing BTC n their reserves or foreign exchange plans. Critics groan as studies take off But not everyone is as sanguine as Deaton, even as the movement gathers steam. Dr. Peter Schiff, economist, gold supporter, and outspoken critic of Bitcoin, argued on Twitter that Bitcoin’s moonshot is nothing more than hype. He thinks it still has no inherent value and is far too erratic to be a true haven. But Deaton isn’t fazed. He acknowledges that he has “confirmation and wealth-preservation bias.” Still, he maintains that Bitcoin is the most secure long-term asset in our current political instability and economic storm world. Deaton tells investors to look past price charts. He says they should instead wonder: Where is the world headed? The solution, according to Deaton, is none other than BTC.

In a new YouTube update, Wood shares a Bitcoin-to-gold chart that she says is still in an uptrend, partially due to BTC’s “anti-fragile” nature in recent years. “This uptrend has not been broken. Again, this aligns with the net bullish risk-on kind of market that we think we’re in, and I guess you could call the markets anti-fragile, which is a description used in Bitcoin. It’s been able to withstand all kinds of turmoil and we think that the markets, the equities markets, are following Bitcoin in this regard.” Source: ARK Invest/YouTube Wood is also optimistic about the crypto industry given regulatory clarity from the Trump administration and what she believes is an incoming reconfiguration of the financial services space. “We think this is a very powerful movement. We think the financial services sector is going to reconfigure completely in the next five to ten years, and that of course Bitcoin and now Circle and of course Coinbase as well. Robinhod, [and] others… SoFi is now moving back into crypto in a big way now that regulatory clarity is here.

2025-06-08T23:39:28,"Asia Morning Briefing: Michael Saylor Downplays BTC's Quantum Threat","Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. BlackRock calls Quantum computers, with their ability to outperform classical binary computers and break traditional encryption, a threat to crypto . So surely BTC would price this in, as the threat of computers soon being able to break the encryption that enables the scarcity of bitcoin is an existential one. But on a recent CNBC appearance, Strategy's Michael Saylor downplayed quantum's threat to BTC, arguing that the Bitcoin protocol would implement a software upgrade – just like any other tech company – when the threat becomes imminent. ""It's mainly marketing from people that want to sell you the next quantum yo-yo token,"" Saylor said on CNBC. ""Google and Microsoft aren't going to sell you a computer that cracks modern cryptography because it would destroy Google and Microsoft – and the U.S. Government and the banking system."" Already, there are a number of proposals about how to secure Proof of Work against the quantum threat, including from BTQ , a startup building quantum-proof crypto hardware. One Bitcoin developer has put forward a draft Bitcoin Improvement Protocol that proposes a hard fork which would move everyone's wallets to quantum-secure addresses. ""Bitcoin is a protocol; the software gets upgraded every year,"" Saylor concluded, arguing that the bigger security threat for bitcoin is phishing. Saylor's view isn't a universal one, however. A recent report from Presto Research argued that the crypto industry is ""unprepared"" for the coming quantum threat. With BTC above $100K and the market getting ready to challenge another all-time high, traders just don't seem to be concerned. As CRCL has a Blockbuster IPO, the True Market Size of Stablecoins Remains a Mystery. Circle recently had a blockbuster initial public offering, and is set to open the U.S. trading week Monday at over $107 – an impressive rally over its opening price of $69. The number of stablecoins in circulation – the market cap of the asset category – is a well-known fact. Issuance can be seen on-chain after all, and that number comes in at $254 billion, according to CoinGecko data . But figuring out the volume of stablecoins used in payments is a little trickier. In a recent thread on X , Nic Carter, partner at Castle Island Ventures and the cofounder of blockchain data aggregator Coinmetrics, parsed through the available data and found that there's a huge discrepancy in the numbers. Estimating the genuine share of stablecoin transactions driven by payments rather than trading is complicated due to challenges like MEV bot interference, duplicative on-chain transactions, and spam activity designed purely to inflate metrics. Recent analyses illustrate this uncertainty starkly. A top-down heuristic from Visa and Allium estimates stablecoin transaction volumes at roughly $9 trillion annually as of May 2025. However, this figure broadly encompasses trading, DeFi activity, and settlements—not purely payments. In contrast, more detailed bottom-up analyses offer narrower but clearer insights. Fireblocks, a major custody provider, reported annual verified stablecoin payments of around $232 billion, compared with a significantly larger $2.12 trillion in trading volumes among its clients, suggesting that genuine payment transactions represent about 10% of their total stablecoin activity. Similarly, a targeted joint study by Artemis and Dragonfly sampled 20 stablecoin-focused payment providers directly. It calculated a conservative annualized payment volume of approximately $72.3 billion, acknowledging this as a probable undercount given limited sampling. In comparison to that $72.3 billion figure at the high end, Carter writes, is $232 billion, underscoring the substantial uncertainty around how extensively stablecoins are genuinely used as a payment mechanism. As for Circle, the stablecoin issuer doesn't provide a figure in its IPO filing on how much USDC is used for payments, only pointing to general transaction volume. News Roundup Coinbase, BiT Global Settle Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) Delisting Lawsuit BiT Global and Coinbase have settled their legal dispute over Coinbase's delisting of wrapped bitcoin (wBTC), CoinDesk previously reported . According to a joint court filing, BiT Global agreed to dismiss its lawsuit with prejudice—meaning the case cannot be refiled—and each company will cover its own legal costs. BiT Global initially sued Coinbase last year, claiming the delisting unfairly damaged wBTC's liquidity and reputation, while favoring Coinbase’s competing token, cbBTC. Coinbase cited concerns over crypto billionaire Justin Sun’s involvement with wBTC, labeling it an ""unacceptable risk,"" though specific settlement terms beyond the dismissal were not disclosed. Winklevoss Twins' Crypto Exchange Gemini Files Confidentially With SEC for IPO Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange and custody platform founded by billionaires Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has confidentially filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to go public, CoinDesk previously reported . The IPO details, including the size and valuation, remain undisclosed, but Gemini has already engaged Goldman Sachs and Citigroup as financial advisors, positioning itself prominently among crypto-native firms entering traditional markets. This filing follows the successful IPO of stablecoin issuer Circle, whose shares surged dramatically upon debuting on the New York Stock Exchange. Gemini's planned IPO represents a significant step for crypto companies seeking broader acceptance in mainstream finance, although the timing of the offering will depend on the SEC's review and market conditions.

2025-06-08T20:59:50,"Best Crypto to Buy Now with Web3 IPOs and Venture Capital on the Rise","Despite some early momentum, Bitcoin’s price these past few days has mostly hovered in place, uninspiring at the surface. But price alone doesn’t always tell the full story. In the background, foundational shifts are playing out as the buzz around a stablecoin giant’s public debut has spilled beyond crypto circles and into Wall Street chatter. Another major exchange has quietly filed to go public, engaging heavyweight advisors and signaling serious institutional intent. And while this unfolds, venture capital is pouring into crypto-native startups at a pace that few expected in what’s supposedly a shaky market. The price may be sleepy, but everything else is stirring. From boardrooms to browser tabs, crypto’s relevance is being negotiated loudly and in plain view. What These Developments Signal for Crypto’s Next Chapter The stablecoin company Circle’s public debut has forced both traditional investors and crypto skeptics to pay attention. The stock opened at $31 and is now trading around $107 , marking a gain of more than 200% in just a few days. This is not a speculative token pump. It is a regulated company with a stablecoin product, being priced and traded on the New York Stock Exchange like any other major financial player. Its IPO is already being discussed across investment desks, and it has set the tone for what could become a wave of listings. ⚡️ NEW: Gemini has confidentially submitted a draft registration statement for a proposed initial public offering (IPO). pic.twitter.com/4hAKWanCD0 — Crypto Briefing (@Crypto_Briefing) June 6, 2025 Top crypto exchange Gemini is likely to be next. The exchange has confidentially submitted its paperwork to the SEC and is working with advisors like Goldman Sachs and Citigroup to take the company public. This is a firm that has already resolved multiple regulatory issues and is now positioning itself to enter public markets just as confidence in crypto-linked businesses begins to return. Outside public listings, venture capital activity is building quickly. The last week of May alone saw over $160 million raised across at least fifteen different crypto startups. The deals spanned everything from Bitcoin treasury services to AI-focused applications and stablecoin infrastructure. These are not meme projects or NFT drops. They are backed by established funds and include serious institutional names. The return of this kind of funding, especially in a market where asset prices are flat, suggests that long-term bets are already being placed and that key players see this as a time to build, not to wait. Best Crypto to Buy Now – Using the Current Market Sentiment for 10x Profits Snorter While most Layer 2 projects are racing to rebrand Bitcoin with abstract ideas and speculative jargon, Snorter takes a different approach. It leans into the absurdity of internet culture while offering real-time trading tools that mimic what users have come to expect from more established platforms. That contrast is its advantage. In a time when crypto startups are attracting major venture capital and traditional firms are walking into the space with IPO filings, Snorter reads like an experiment gone right. It doesn’t need a billion-dollar valuation or a polished PR team to feel relevant. Its chart movement, community interaction, and growing user activity do that job. Behind the memes and irreverent tone is a bot-powered architecture that lets users monitor and mimic token activity across Solana’s Pump.fun ecosystem. It is a bot, yes, but one with a brain wired to sentiment and market flow. And when VC interest points toward AI-linked and automation-driven crypto tools, Snorter quietly checks the boxes that investors are hunting for. It is still early, both in terms of development and visibility, but the mechanics are in place. Still in its presale phase, the project has managed to garner attention from major publications while being covered by top crypto YouTubers like ClayBro and many others which is usually a move that generates publicity and trust among investors. Price-wise, the project’s SNORT token may be likely to see a huge surge in demand in the coming weeks as the concept gains popularity and demand for AI-powered bots in the space increases. SUBBD Circle’s IPO was a milestone, not just for the company but for the creator economy’s ongoing shift toward ownership and autonomy. That same transition is already being explored from a different angle by SUBBD , a project built around giving creators control over their audiences, their monetization structures, and their long-term value. With traditional platforms still focused on ad revenue and short-term views, SUBBD builds something closer to a marketplace where creators are the product and the platform simultaneously. Its native token is also called the SUBBD token, a currency that allows fans to invest directly in a creator’s potential. Think of it as a public listing, but for individuals instead of corporations. That premise has found unexpected support during a time when investors are clearly looking for utility-led projects. The recent surge in venture capital for crypto startups working with AI and financial tools suggests there is appetite for models that break existing norms, and SUBBD sits neatly within that thesis. It is structured, measurable, and entirely blockchain-native. There’s also a growing awareness that Web3 needs real engagement tools, not just gimmicks. SUBBD’s structure allows creators to build income streams that are recurring, transparent, and not subject to arbitrary platform decisions. In a moment when investors are rewarding crypto products that operate with real-world use cases and tangible incentives, SUBBD brings both. It is not about replacing YouTube or Twitch. It is about changing who benefits when someone clicks subscribe. Solaxy Solaxy may not be walking into a stock exchange like Circle, but the structure it is building is just as relevant for the long game. Designed as a Layer 2 protocol bridging Solana and Ethereum, Solaxy is tuned for a world where cross-chain compatibility is no longer optional. With major crypto companies filing for IPOs and stablecoins being discussed in mainstream financial circles, infrastructure is becoming the priority. That is precisely where Solaxy fits in. The project operates with a focus on fast, low-fee transactions across major ecosystems. But its deeper value is in how it treats staking. Solaxy’s token, SOLX, is not just a placeholder or a governance label. It is wired into the network’s operations, offering users the ability to earn through high-yield staking mechanisms that support liquidity and engagement. At a time when capital is moving back into crypto, projects with meaningful, self-sustaining utility tend to rise above the rest. $SOLX has got what YOU need. 🛸🪐45M Raised! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/hamUNI7Hgz — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) June 6, 2025 Solaxy is also taking cues from institutional preferences. Transparency, layered security, and sustainable yield mechanics are increasingly what separate serious platforms from short-lived trends. Set to launch soon, the SOLX token’s presale is likely to gain traction due to it being one of the most successful ones this quarter, having raised more than $45 million at the time of writing. Solaxy incorporates those ideas with a model that doesn’t overpromise or lean on hype. It may not grab headlines like a public offering, but it is being quietly built for longevity. In a cycle where speed and scalability will again become central topics, and as big names like Apple and Uber explore crypto payments, a protocol like Solaxy feels unusually well-timed. Bitcoin Hyper The market rarely rewards ideas that arrive too early or too late. Bitcoin Hyper is trying to land exactly in the middle. It’s not trying to replace Bitcoin but to fix where it falls short: transaction speed and scalability. As the space watches IPO filings, venture capital flows, and traditional companies dipping into stablecoins, there is renewed focus on infrastructure that can actually support growth. Bitcoin Hyper sees this as its entry point. The project uses a multi-pronged approach, pulling in technology from Optimistic and ZK Rollups along with Solana-based speed via a smart contract validation layer. That setup allows Bitcoin to move as if it were built for high-speed DeFi without losing its original security logic. This type of architecture is the kind that VCs are looking for now. Not hype, but technical models that answer clear problems. That is part of the reason Bitcoin Hyper’s presale has already drawn early attention, with steady capital inflow and ongoing community interest. Utility-wise, the token is designed for actual usage within its Layer 2 environment. It has functions tied to gas savings, staking incentives, and cross-chain interoperability. While most projects still depend on marketing spikes, Bitcoin Hyper is shaped more like a tool than a trend. And in a cycle where companies are going public, raising hundreds of millions, and launching ETFs, that practical angle could be the difference between fading away and getting picked up for something much bigger. Conclusion The current stream of developments points to a market that may be entering a structurally bullish phase, even if price charts have yet to reflect it. Institutional interest is no longer theoretical, with crypto firms actively going public and venture capital returning in strength across multiple layers of the ecosystem. This kind of momentum often precedes broader rallies, especially when backed by real funding and regulatory progress. The projects mentioned above each reflect aspects of that shift from AI integration and token utility to infrastructure and staking innovation. If this pro-crypto wave continues to gather pace, they could be among the strongest gainers in the weeks ahead, making them well worth tracking now rather than later.

This positive trend mirrors the shift in sentiment amongst Ethereum investors since the start of the year’s second quarter. Ethereum ETFs Hit 15 Consecutive Days Of Capital Inflows According to data from SoSoValue, the US Ethereum ETFs registered a net inflow of $25.22 million on Friday, June 6. This latest daily performance marked the 15th straight day of capital inflows — the second-longest such streak since launch in July 2024 — for exchange-traded funds. BlackRock’s iShare Ethereum Trust (with the ticker ETHA) accounted for the majority of the inflows on Friday, posting $15.86 million to close the week. Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust (ETH) was the only other US-based Ethereum ETF fund to record any activity, with a total daily net inflow of $9.37 million. This $25.22 million single-day performance brought the total net weekly inflow to a little over $281 million in the past week, representing the fourth consecutive week of capital influx for the Ethereum-based products. In the previous trading week (May 26 to May 30), the Ethereum ETFs posted a similar $285.84 million total net inflow. According to market data, the US-based spot Ethereum ETFs have registered $856.81 million in total net inflows over the span of these four weeks. Ultimately, these positive performances show a change in the way investors are looking at Ethereum at the moment. Unsurprisingly, this positive shift in investor sentiment has been reflected in the price performance of ETH over the past few weeks. The altcoin has witnessed renewed interest and demand , with its value up by more than 15% in the last 30 days. As of this writing, the Ethereum price stands at around $2,521, reflecting an over 1% in the last 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the altcoin’s value is down by 0.8% in the last seven days. Inflows For Bitcoin ETFs Slowing Down The spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US also had their own streak going for the majority of the last month before it ended on Friday , May 29. The crypto-linked financial products have had a mixed performance of daily inflows and outflows since then. According to data from SoSoValue, the Bitcoin exchange-traded funds recorded a net outflow of $128.81 million in the past week. On Friday, the BTC ETFs saw a total of $47.82 million withdrawn, bringing the trading week to a close on a negative note.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etfs-record-four-weeks-of-positive-inflows/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Ethereum|ETH|ETH Price|Ethereum ETFs|ethereum price",cryptocompare
2025-06-08T20:00:43,"JPMorgan Warns Slowdown Gradually Seeping Up and Spreading Across US Economy Despite Job Growth Topping Estimates","Banking giant JPMorgan Chase warns that cracks are beginning to appear in various sectors of the US economy, even as the headlines remain upbeat. In a new CNBC interview, JPMorgan chief global strategist David Kelly says that hard data is suggesting that the US economy is losing steam despite adding 139,000 jobs in May, beating expectations, and keeping the unemployment rate steady at 4.2%. But under the hood, Kelly points out that the Labor Department revised down job gains in March and April, while noting that the US lost hundreds of thousands of jobs last month. “This was a lot softer than the headlines suggested. To me, the one issue is that we saw over 600,000 jobs lost according to the Household Survey. That’s very volatile, but that was a negative signal. The other thing is cutting 95,000 [jobs] out of the prior two months. So we’ve only averaged 124,000 jobs so far this year, per month, for the first five months of the year. It was 168,000 last year. When I’m looking at a lot of data, this slowdown is gradually seeping up and spreading across the economy. I think we’re missing it because we’re looking at headline payroll numbers or the weirdness in terms of trade and GDP. But this economy is gradually slowing down here.” Data from the Pennsylvania-based lender PNC Bank shows that the number of adults working or looking for work dropped by 625,000 in May, effectively negating the number of jobs lost in the same month. According to the bank, the labor force contraction may indicate that “potential workers are becoming discouraged.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-08T20:00:39,"Tether’s USDT Gains Traction in LATAM as IPO Valuation Buzz Grows","Tether (USDT) is consolidating its hold on the stablecoin market with massive expansion into Latin America. In a significant move, the stablecoin giant made inroads into Bolivia in October 2024 when Banco BISA, a banking giant, secured custody services for Tether . Now, Tether is gaining traction among retail users. USDT Now Accepted in Bolivia as Inflation Drives Adoption Notably, Bolivian merchants are now listing goods prices directly in USDT, suggesting the stablecoin’s payment acceptance. This marks Tether’s shift from speculative investment to everyday practical use. The development is practical for users in a Latin American country where fiat currency volatility and the high inflation rate are challenging. The stablecoin offers better predictability and provides a stable digital alternative. Tether’s decision to allow local merchants to price goods in USDT could boost consumer confidence and enable stablecoin to gain traction as a medium of exchange. Consumers could easily adapt, see it as the new normal, and embrace it for convenience. Tether’s USDT could help lower the losses incurred from inflation and currency devaluation by positioning itself as both a transactional currency and a store of value. This might serve as a catalyst to its adoption by consumers outside of crypto. Tether’s Market Cap Surges to $154.85B Amid Valuation Speculation As per CoinMarketCap data , USDT is the leading stablecoin with a market cap of $154.85 billion, with high liquidity and trust in the crypto industry. Its expansionary move could further grow its value to a higher level, given that in the last quarter of 2024, its market cap was just about $120 billion . Meanwhile, Jon Ma, a fintech analyst, has provided insights into Tether’s valuation should the stablecoin giant decide to go public. According to Ma, Tether could be worth approximately 515 billion based on its massive unrealized gains from Bitcoin and gold reserves. With an assumed public valuation of $515 billion, Tether could become one of the top 20 largest companies globally. Paolo Ardoino Downplays IPO Necessity Interestingly, Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, referred to the projections as potentially conservative. This suggests that the figures could rank higher if Tether decides to go public. However, Ardoino maintains there is no need for the stablecoin giant to go public via an initial public offering (IPO). Unlike Circle, which has officially filed for an IPO , Tether appears determined to maintain its current private ownership structure.

2025-06-08T19:47:59,"Expert Says Bitcoin and XRP Could Push Cardano (ADA) to Top Five. Here’s how","Cardano (ADA) is garnering new attention from market analysts who believe it may soon emerge as one of the leading assets in the cryptocurrency space. Among the most vocal is analyst Tim Warren, who recently stated that ADA could significantly benefit from its increasing association with Bitcoin and XRP, two of the most prominent blockchain ecosystems. Speaking during a recent episode of the Investing Broz podcast, Warren suggested that Cardano is well-positioned to capitalize on the upcoming altcoin rally. He emphasized that its growing engagement with cross-chain projects could enable the asset to outperform competitors in the medium term. According to Warren, this renewed momentum could potentially elevate Cardano into the top five digital assets by market capitalization. Mending Fences With the XRP Army The Cardano network, under the leadership of founder Charles Hoskinson, has recently adopted a more collaborative approach within the broader blockchain sector. One major focus has been on cultivating productive relationships with other established networks. In particular, Cardano has taken meaningful steps to align itself with Ripple. After years of hostility, Hoskinson has made public efforts to mend past tensions with the XRP community. He has expressed interest in working with Ripple and XRP and potentially integrating RLUSD , Ripple’s stablecoin, into the Cardano ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This shift toward collaboration has also coincided with the release of a promotional Ripple video that briefly included Cardano’s logo, a detail that many observers interpret as a confirmation of collaboration. The Connection With Bitcoin Parallel to these developments, Cardano has been working on infrastructure that would allow it to access liquidity from Bitcoin. Through ongoing improvements to its native Lace wallet and planned protocol upgrades, the project aims to introduce decentralized finance capabilities to users holding Bitcoin, thereby expanding the utility of both chains. Warren believes these initiatives may have a transformative impact on Cardano’s position in the market. By integrating aspects of both XRP and Bitcoin into its strategy, Cardano could see a rise in developer activity, higher total value locked in its ecosystem, and increased investor confidence. For ADA to reach the top five, its market capitalization would need to grow by nearly 300%, with price levels approaching $2.60. Cardano (ADA) has shown short-term strength after rebounding from $0.619 to $0.669. The asset is now trading at $0.665, and Warren sees continued bullish momentum, with a potential rise to $1 by June. Positive weekly indicators and multi-chain growth support this outlook. Some forecasts even predict that Cardano (ADA) could hit $10 . Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-06-08T19:26:06,"Michael Saylor is Back in the Spotlight: Bitcoin Move Could Be Announced Tomorrow","Michael Saylor, founder of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), the company with the largest Bitcoin holding in the world, signaled that he will buy Bitcoin today as part of a Sunday tradition. Saylor cited a chart showing each BTC purchase by the company as an orange dot, asking for “more orange to be posted” on the chart. This suggests that the company will announce that it will be purchasing BTC, likely tomorrow. The company has likely already made the purchase and will announce it tomorrow.

2025-06-08T18:55:00,"Trump, Musk feud; Circle IPO prices above range, Strategy upsizes offering | Weekly Recap","This week’s crypto roundup captures a whirlwind of activity across markets, politics, and policy. Tech mogul Elon Musk is feuding with President Donald Trump, and meme coin prices tumbled, while Circle made headlines with a stronger-than-expected initial public offering. Institutional appetite for Bitcoin intensified as Strategy and Semler Scientific bolstered their treasuries, and Japan’s Metaplanet unveiled a massive $5.3 billion BTC acquisition plan. Meanwhile, regulatory shifts took shape, with the UK lifting its retail crypto ETN ban and Ripple’s RLUSD gaining approval in Dubai. From Robinhood’s European expansion to Yuga Labs proposing the end of ApeCoin governance, the week revealed growing divides between legacy players and new strategies reshaping the crypto economy. Trump, Musk conflict weighs on meme coin performance Tensions between Trump and Musk reached a boiling point Thursday and continued over the weekend. Musk, who reportedly contributed $295 million to Republicans in the 2024 election year (most of that money going to Trump), grew angry with the GOP for its attempts to pass a sweeping budget bill. When Trump criticized Musk publicly, the Tesla CEO alleged on X that the president is named in confidential criminal files involving sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The public dispute has negatively impacted meme coins associated with both figures, with the Official Trump ( TRUMP ) and Dogecoin ( DOGE ) ranking among the 10 worst-performing cryptocurrencies over 24 hours, according to CoinGecko. Also from MAGA world… The Trump family has reportedly issued a cease-and-desist letter to entities behind a disputed Trump-branded crypto wallet. Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and Barron Trump have all publicly disavowed the $TRUMP Wallet project. Circle prices IPO above expected range Circle announced on Wednesday that the price of its IPO would be $31. This debut raised about $1.1 billion , above the estimated range of $24-26. Circle expanded from the initial proposal of 24 million Class A shares to approximately 34 million.

Semler Scientific also adds Bitcoin to its coffer Semler Scientific bought 185 BTC for $20 million in the ten days ending June 3. They paid around $107,974 per Bitcoin. This purchase brings the company’s total holdings to 4,449 BTC. UK proposes lifting retail crypto ETN ban The Financial Conduct Authority has announced proposals to lift limitations on cryptocurrency exchange-traded notes (cETNs) for retail users.

Yuga Labs proposes ending ApeCoin DAO governance The inventor of Bored Apes proposed terminating the ApeCoin ( APE ) DAO governance structure in favor of a new operating paradigm. CEO Greg Solano slammed the current structure in Thursday’s proposal, saying “ApeCoin DAO was a bold experiment, but one born of a different era” that has devolved into “sluggish, noisy, and often unserious governance theater.” Singapore court rejects WazirX restructuring plan The Singapore High Court declined WazirX’s proposed restructuring plan aimed at recovering from last year’s $230 million security exploit.

In a new press release , the New York Department of Transportation (DOT) warns the city about the scam, which uses fraudulent QR codes to steal victims’ payment data. Authorities say that the QR codes lead to malicious third-party websites that ask for credit card data, while noting that the legitimate ways to pay for parking in New York are through the ParkNYC app or on the meters themselves. Source: New York DOT As stated by New York DOT Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, “Consumers beware: scammers are targeting parking meters, and we want you to be vigilant. If you see a QR code on a parking meter, do not scan it, and please report it. This is a scam to collect your payment information, and we are working with law enforcement to hold those responsible accountable.” According to the press release, authorities have started aggressively combating the scheme by conducting city-wide inspections, removing the QR codes and setting up ways for residents to report fake QR codes. If a fake QR code is spotted, residents are asked to tear it down and contact ParkNYC.

2025-06-08T18:38:08,"A Saudi Prince Has Been an XRP Holder Since 2017, VivoPower CEO Confirms","In a recent interview highlighted by crypto commentator Crypto Eri Carpe Diem on X, VivoPower CEO Kelvin Chin confirmed that a Saudi Arabian prince has been an XRP holder since 2017. This revelation comes amid VivoPower’s broader initiative to integrate XRP into its treasury strategy —a pioneering move that captures global attention. VivoPower’s Bold XRP-Centric Strategy VivoPower International PLC, a Nasdaq-listed clean energy firm, recently announced a groundbreaking private placement that raised $121 million. Its primary objective: to become the first publicly traded company with a treasury strategy centered on XRP. This capital infusion was largely led by His Royal Highness Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki bin Talal Al Saud, who committed approximately $100 million through Eleventh Holding Company. CEO Kevin Chin emphasized the move’s significance for both VivoPower and the broader XRP community, stating that the company aims not only to acquire XRP but also to build decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). Exclusive #2 Interview with @Vivo_Power SCOOP #XRP Holders: This company has a vision, beyond just ""holding"". SCOOP #XRP Builders: Capital allocated to builders to grow the XRPL Ecosystem. POWERFUL strategy Find them at @xrplapex #UtilityMatters More Scoop Imminent pic.twitter.com/4yFGKJSlyj — Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) June 7, 2025 A Long-Term XRP Holder: The Saudi Royal’s Investment In the interview, Chin recounted that when VivoPower explored potential partners for its XRP treasury initiative, they connected with a member of the Saudi royal family, who disclosed their early adoption of XRP, dating back to 2017. This revelation aligned with the prince’s statement in the VivoPower press release: “We have been investors in the digital asset sector for a decade and have been long‑term holders of XRP”. Strategic Timing and Political Context This moment carries geopolitical resonance. Prince Abdulaziz’s support appears to be influenced by conversations during a recent meeting with U.S. political leadership, including President Donald Trump. According to the prince, those high-level discussions helped affirm that the present time is ideal for rolling out digital assets and blockchain solutions in Saudi Arabia. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Adding weight to the strategy, the VivoPower capital raise echoes the playbook pioneered by Bitcoin’s advocacy through Strategy, the so-called “XRP for corporate treasury” vision. VivoPower is aiming to replicate such a treasury-led approach, now focused on XRP. What Comes Next A shareholder vote scheduled for June 18 remains a key pending step. If approved, VivoPower intends to allocate the bulk of the funds to XRP accumulation and development of XRPL-based DeFi applications, while also addressing corporate debt and supporting operations. Broader Implications for XRP and Institutional Adoption This development marks a significant milestone for XRP’s institutional narrative. It signals a departure from public companies favoring Bitcoin and Ethereum for treasury allocation, opening a new precedent with XRP as the focal asset. The engagement of a Middle Eastern royal investor, combined with high-level U.S. discussions, underscores rising geopolitical and financial interest in XRP. For XRP holders and observers, VivoPower’s move, anchored by a committed long-term investor and Ripple ecosystem expertise, is poised to be a defining moment in crypto treasury diversification.

2025-06-08T18:12:04,"Bitcoin Pushes Toward $107K Even as Trump Sends National Guard to Los Angeles","Bitcoin (BTC) BTC maintained a steady climb Saturday as U.S. domestic tensions intensified. Markets remained focused on crypto resilience despite unsettling headlines, including an immigration-related standoff in Los Angeles. According to a report by CNBC, over 100 arrests have been reported as clashes continued between protesters and federal agents, prompting President Trump to authorize the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops. By Sunday morning, elements of the 79th Infantry Brigade had arrived on-site, according to Northern Command. Further escalation came with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warning that U.S. Marines at Camp Pendleton could also be mobilized if violence persists. Still, Bitcoin’s stability at $106,332 suggests crypto investors remain unfazed, treating the unrest as a regional event rather than a market-moving crisis. Bitcoin traded within a narrow $1,057 range, from $105,043 to $106,101, and is currently hovering at $106,332. The price action showed a strong rebound after briefly dipping below $105,100, as buying interest re-emerged around the $105,400 support level, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. An early breakout attempt above $106,100 ran into selling pressure, creating a high-volume resistance zone. That move was short-lived as profit-taking set in, though the coin held onto its gains. The consolidation structure remains bullish, with the pattern of higher lows hinting at a potential push toward $107,000 if resistance breaks cleanly. Despite broader macro headwinds, BTC continues to attract buyers during dips, underscoring its role as a perceived hedge amid rising uncertainty. Technical Analysis Highlights BTC traded within a $1,288 range (1.22%) between a low of $105,043.65 and a 24-hour high of $106,332. Resistance around $105,900–$106,100 was broken as price surged beyond this zone with strong volume during the early afternoon. Support at $105,400 held firm through several retests, reinforcing bullish sentiment. A breakout to $106,332 occurred around 13:48, followed by minor profit-taking and stabilization above $106,000. The hourly chart shows an ascending trend with consistent higher lows, invalidating the earlier ""pump and dump"" interpretation. With momentum intact, BTC may test the $107,000 resistance level if current support near $105,800 holds.

2025-06-08T18:11:09,"Experienced Analyst Reveals 4 Essential Conditions for the Mega Altcoin Season","Cryptocurrency analyst Miles Deutscher made a remarkable assessment about the altcoin season, which altcoin investors are eagerly awaiting, in his latest statement. Deutscher, who claimed that he could predict when the altcoin season would start thanks to the artificial intelligence model he developed, stated that he tested this model by comparing it with previous cycles and that the results were “surprising.” Deutscher recalled that the altcoin seasons in 2017 and 2021 offered increases of 1,000% to 10,000%, and said that such major movements have not yet been seen in the current cycle. He noted that apart from the partial increases experienced in April and November-December of last year, major altcoins generally performed poorly against Bitcoin. According to the analyst, there are several key reasons why this cycle is different from previous periods: Macroeconomic Conditions: While the pandemic-induced stimulus packages in the 2020-2021 period provided serious liquidity to the crypto market, this situation has been reversed in the current environment with the FED's balance sheet reduction policies. Institutional Bitcoin Investments: Bitcoin ETFs and the entry of giants like BlackRock are keeping capital in Bitcoin, which is leading to a weakening of the “capital flow from Bitcoin to altcoins” effect seen in previous cycles. Ethereum’s Weak Performance: Ethereum’s failure to make a strong breakout against Bitcoin is preventing the start of a large-scale altcoin rally. Low Individual Interest: Scandals such as UST, FTX and the losses experienced in the recent memecoin frenzy caused individual investors to move away from the market. Related News: Crypto Users Beware: Hackers' New Methods Have Emerged - What Steps Are Necessary to Prevent the Loss of All Assets? Miles Deutscher stated that the model called Altcoin Rally Score (ARS), which he developed by taking this data into account, consists of four basic indicators that will trigger the altcoin season: Bitcoin Dominance: Bitcoin dominance must fall below 60% and show a decline of 4 points in the 21-day period. Ethereum's Leadership: The ETH/BTC ratio must break above the 200-day moving average and make a new 90-day high. Altcoin Seasonal Index: If this index rises above 40 and rises for two consecutive weeks, it will indicate a broad-based rally. Trends and Individual Interest: Market sentiment, trend momentum, and stablecoin liquidity should show a positive trend. Deutscher predicts that the new altcoin season, which he defines as 3.0, will be shorter and more selective (sector-based) than previous cycles. He cited both the global liquidity crunch and the fact that the supply of newly released altcoins is much higher than in previous years as the main reasons for this. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-08T18:00:16,"Bitcoin (BTC) Can’t Break Out, Meanwhile This AI Project Is Quietly Making Its Holders Rich","Bitcoin, the king of cryptocurrencies, is showing signs of fatigue. Despite its iconic status, Bitcoin is struggling to break out of its current price stagnation. Meanwhile, a promising new project, Ruvi AI , is quietly making its early investors wealthier by the day. This AI-driven blockchain project is combining innovation with real-world utility, creating a unique opportunity for those seeking high return on investment. Here’s why Ruvi AI is emerging as a standout in the crypto space. Bitcoin’s Stagnation Leaves Investors Frustrated Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market remains undeniable, but it’s no longer the profit powerhouse it used to be. Recent months have seen Bitcoin moving sideways, caught between resistance levels and market indecision. While still a reliable store of value, Bitcoin’s price action lacks the dramatic momentum that attracted speculative investors in the past. For those looking for explosive growth, this lack of movement is a signal to explore emerging projects. Ruvi AI’s Explosive Presale Offers Unmatched Growth Potential Enter Ruvi AI , a project at the intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence . Unlike Bitcoin, Ruvi AI is in its early stages, offering significant room for growth. The ongoing presale has already raised an impressive $1.5 million , with almost 135 million tokens sold . Priced at just $0.015 per token during Phase 2, Ruvi AI represents an enticing entry point for investors looking for outsized returns. What makes Ruvi AI particularly exciting is its structured valuation. Unlike speculative price predictions, its planned $0.07 valuation post-presale is a clear feature of the project roadmap. Additionally, analysts forecast a $1 valuation post-listing , ensuring that investors can see the potential for substantial upside before the year is out. Real-World Applications That Set Ruvi AI Apart While Bitcoin’s utility is primarily focused on its use as a decentralized currency, Ruvi AI offers real-world applications that solve immediate problems. This focus makes the project not only a compelling investment but also a viable solution for industries in need of disruption. Healthcare : Ruvi AI improves patient care by enabling faster, more accurate diagnostics and streamlining medical processes. Logistics : The platform optimizes supply chain management, reducing costs and increasing operational efficiency for businesses. Finance : Ruvi AI enhances fraud detection while safeguarding transactions, introducing new levels of trust and reliability to financial ecosystems. This practical utility ensures that Ruvi AI is positioned for widespread adoption across industries, giving it a competitive edge over stagnating projects focused on abstract goals. VIP Investment Tiers Offer Outstanding Returns Ruvi AI’s presale doesn’t just promise growth; it rewards early adopters with its lucrative VIP investment tier system . This tiered structure offers generous token bonuses, maximizing returns for those who commit early to the project. Here’s a detailed look at how the tiers work: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900 . Value at $1 per token: $70,000 . VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680 . Value at $1 per token: $224,000 . VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600 . Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000 . This reward structure demonstrates Ruvi AI’s commitment to making its early investors a top priority, solidifying its reputation as a high-potential project. Why Ruvi AI Is Quietly Leading the Way For investors seeking profit potential that Bitcoin can no longer deliver, Ruvi AI is the project to watch. Its explosive presale, combined with its focus on solving real-world problems, positions it as a standout in a crowded market. Ruvi AI is more than just another cryptocurrency; it’s a platform built with scalability and practical impact in mind.

2025-06-08T18:00:00,"Top cryptocurrencies to watch this week: Flare, Aptos, Pi Network","Cryptocurrency prices retreated last week as investors locked profits, Bitcoin ( BTC ) and most altcoins will likely react to the upcoming U.S. consumer inflation data, which will impact the next action by the Federal Reserve. A lower-than-expected inflation figure could pressure the bank to cut interest rates. Some of the top coins to watch will be Flare ( FLR ), Aptos ( APT ), and Pi Network ( PI ). Flare Flare is a fast-growing layer-1 network whose token is valued at over $1 billion. It will be in the spotlight this week as it unlocks tokens worth over $35 million on Monday. In addition, its ecosystem is experiencing strong growth, with the total value locked at $188 million, up from $51 million in January. Also, its stablecoin market cap has jumped to $150 million from $5.2 million in May. The daily chart shows that the FLR token has pulled back in the past few weeks, moving from a high of $0.02220, to $0.018. It has formed a falling wedge, a popular bullish reversal sign. Therefore, it will likely have a bullish breakout, with the target being at $0.0220. Flare price chart | Source: crypto.news Aptos Aptos, a top layer-1 blockchain network, will be in focus this week as it unlocks tokens worth $53 million, equivalent to 1.8% of its float. Also, the market cap of all stablecoins in the network has jumped to a record high of $1.32 billion. APT token has been in a strong downtrend in the past few days, forming a descending channel. It has moved below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, while the MACD and the Relative Strength Index have moved downwards. Aptos token will likely remain in this range, and possibly bounce back to the upper side of the range at $6. A drop below the lower side of the channel will point to further downside to $3.5. You might also like: Flipping Uniswap, Flopping on Price: PancakeSwap Paradox Aptos price chart | Source: crypto.news Pi Network The Pi Network token will be watched this week for two reasons. First, the network will continue unlocking over 68 million tokens this week, increasing the number in circulation.
