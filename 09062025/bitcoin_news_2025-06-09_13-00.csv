2025-06-09T10:56:09,"According to CoinShares Report, Digital Assets Inflows Reach 7th Consecutive Week! Here Are the Cryptocurrencies with the Most Inflows","According to the latest data from CoinShares, digital asset investment products recorded net inflows of $224 million last week, marking the seventh consecutive week of positive inflows, bringing the total for this period to $11 billion. Ethereum Dominates Digital Asset Flows Amid Policy Uncertainty and Bitcoin’s Continual Outflows However, the pace of inflows slowed as investors remained cautious as they awaited key policy signals from the US Federal Reserve. Ethereum finished the week as the leader with $296.4 million in inflows, showing its strongest performance since the US elections in November 2024. Ethereum has recorded $1.5 billion in inflows over the past seven weeks, accounting for 10.5% of total assets under management (AUM). This represents a significant recovery in investor sentiment towards Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. In contrast, Bitcoin saw $56.5 million in outflows, the second straight week of losses. Short Bitcoin investment products also saw small outflows, reflecting waning interest in bearish bets as the market awaits greater clarity on inflation and interest rate decisions. Altcoins remained relatively calm. Sui (SUI) saw a modest inflow of $1.1 million, while XRP continued the negative sentiment with an outflow of $6.6 million, extending its withdrawal streak to a third week. Regional Distribution Entries were widely distributed across regions: United States: $175 million Germany: $47.8 million Switzerland: $15.7 million Canada: $9.8 million Australia: $6.5 million Meanwhile, Brazil (-$9.2 million) and Hong Kong (-$14.6 million) saw small increases, with Hong Kong seeing a sharp reversal after record inflows. The slowdown in inflows reflects increased investor caution amid macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly as the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates looms. Analysts suggest that despite the recovery in sentiment towards Ethereum, the overall market may remain in a holding mode until inflation and interest rate expectations become clearer. Despite these headwinds, the continued weekly inflows highlight the resilience of institutional interest in digital assets even in a fragile macroeconomic environment. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-09T10:52:00,"Bitcoin Price Could Explode After June 11 CPI Report, Says Analyst","The post Bitcoin Price Could Explode After June 11 CPI Report, Says Analyst appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin could be on the verge of a massive breakout, according to popular crypto analyst Doctor Profit , who predicts a potential price surge of up to 170% in the coming months. With a Golden Cross formation , key support near $100K , and a pivotal CPI inflation report just days away, the market may be heading for explosive gains. Bitcoin Eyes Breakout as Key Resistance Is Tested At the start of June, Bitcoin was trading at $104,588.85, but briefly dipped 4.10% between June 3–5. However, it bounced back sharply from $100,400 on June 6 , rising 2.74% in a single day. Since then, BTC has gained another 5.07% , currently sitting around $106,663.68. Doctor Profit shared on X (formerly Twitter) that Bitcoin is attempting to break a diagonal resistance line —a move he believes could launch BTC into a new all-time high soon . “A confirmed Golden Cross and strong $100K support signal a bullish breakout. BTC could rise 70–170% if macro factors align,” he wrote. Why CPI Inflation Data Could Make or Break BTC Rally All eyes are on the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data release scheduled for June 11, 2025 . In April, CPI rose from 319.799 to 320.795 points. This month, it’s projected to reach 321.9 , according to TEForecast. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : U.S. CPI Report to Decide Crypto’s Next Move – Will the Fed Hold Back? , More importantly, the U.S. inflation rate , which dropped to 2.3% in April, is expected by Wall Street to rise slightly to 2.5% . However, Doctor Profit believes the number could surprise to the downside —possibly between 2.1% and 2.3% . A lower-than-expected CPI could spark optimism, increasing chances of a Fed rate cut —a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin. Next Bitcoin Price Target: $108K–$110K? Doctor Profit also notes a liquidity cluster between $108K and $110K , which may be BTC’s next short-term target before a bigger breakout. If Bitcoin pushes through that zone, it could open the path for a sustained rally. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-09T10:42:06,"Best Crypto to Buy Now As Japan Follows USA In New Bitcoin Buying Push","Japan has been making steady progress in crypto adoption, and the signs are becoming difficult to ignore. While the United States has captured most of the attention with its institutional moves and political involvement, Japan has quietly aligned itself with similar intent. Investors in the country have become increasingly active in acquiring digital assets, and recent company behavior has brought more attention to this shift. Japan’s Legal and Market Changes Reflect a Structured Approach to Crypto Growth Recent data from Japan shows a rise in both activity and participation. There are now over 12 million crypto exchange accounts registered in the country. Spot trading volumes have touched 1.9 trillion yen , with margin trading close behind. These are not signs of early experimentation. The infrastructure is in place, and usage is rising. At the regulatory level, several developments suggest a push toward creating a more functional crypto economy. A new classification has been introduced for service providers who facilitate transactions but do not hold customer funds. These intermediaries are no longer required to meet capital thresholds, since the responsibility for compliance lies with the licensed platforms they connect users to. The Payment Services Act has been amended to allow up to half of a stablecoin issuer’s backing reserves to be held in low-risk assets. This makes operations more efficient without removing the requirement for reliability. It could also help Japanese stablecoin issuers compete with better-resourced projects in the West. Japan is laser focused on $BTC . pic.twitter.com/V79lz8KzPV — Dylan LeClair (@DylanLeClair_) June 8, 2025 MetaPlanet, a MicroStrategy-like entity based in Japan, serves as a relevant case. The company has been purchasing Bitcoin at regular intervals and has stated its ambition to own one percent of the total supply. This goal alone has sparked significant interest. It has also been trending in Google search results across Japan, suggesting that public awareness is expanding. The pattern is consistent, with interest is growing on both institutional and retail fronts. Taxation is under review as well. Policymakers are discussing a change from the current progressive system to a flat 20% tax on crypto gains . There is also a proposal to allow investors to carry losses forward for up to three years, which would align crypto assets with other investment classes. Alongside these efforts, Japan is considering the legal path to crypto-based ETFs. If passed, this could open the way for more accessible exposure through regulated financial products. These legal changes do not rely on speculation, but rather represent a deliberate policy shift. If other countries in the region respond with similar measures, altcoins with clear utility and early-stage pricing may benefit from this growing attention. Best Crypto to Buy Now That Could Gain Traction in Japan and Rest of Asia SUBBD SUBBD is building a model that breaks away from the usual creator-token gimmickry. Instead of relying on promises about future features or vague mentions of decentralization, it has focused early on utility and access. The $SUBBD token is not just for staking or speculation. It acts as a pass into a platform built for creators, analysts, artists, and niche internet personalities who want more control over how they earn and interact with their audience. The token is already in use. Holders gain access to gated content, analytics tools, and creator-run digital storefronts. What makes this concept stronger is the platform’s design to function across regions, including those where traditional monetization platforms face friction. That makes it easier for creators in Asia and elsewhere to plug into the ecosystem without chasing partnerships with foreign ad networks or donation platforms that rarely work in their favor. SUBBD also operates with its own smart filtering system that helps content surface organically instead of relying on ad-backed recommendation algorithms. This gives users more freedom and creators better visibility. With adoption in Asia gaining pace and regulators opening the door to projects with utility, platforms that create local relevance may find early traction. The token’s presale is still open, giving early buyers a price advantage before further listings are announced. Whether or not Japan becomes a direct target for rollout, SUBBD’s model is well positioned for countries seeking alternatives to platform monopolies. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper is a technical project with a very specific mission. It does not try to reinvent Bitcoin but focuses on extending its usability. Most Bitcoin holders are familiar with the limitations that come with the network’s speed and fees. Bitcoin Hyper works around this by functioning as a secondary network designed to process transactions faster without requiring changes to Bitcoin itself. The architecture draws influence from multiple sources. It uses techniques borrowed from zero-knowledge computation and optimistic validation to process blocks faster. Settlements are still rooted in Bitcoin’s security layer, but the actual transfers happen on Bitcoin Hyper’s layer. This dual setup means faster confirmation times, smaller fees, and broader use cases. Bitcoin Hyper also introduces a system where users can send Bitcoin to a smart contract address, receive an equivalent on the secondary network, and spend it almost instantly. This idea has existed in fragments before, but the execution here is smoother, with fewer dependencies on bridges or manual claims. There is also a meme element that ties into its branding, but that is mostly cosmetic. However, it has helped the project gain major traction across social media channels, with even some top crypto YouTubers having covered it and speculating it to be a high-potential token, with one example being ClayBro . The project has leaned into community-building without letting that distract from its functionality. For markets like Japan, where both meme interest and practical use are respected in equal measure, Bitcoin Hyper might find an audience willing to experiment. The presale is still ongoing, and the early stages suggest healthy traction among crypto participants looking for a project that does something specific and does it well. Snorter Snorter offers a utility-focused trading companion that keeps things simple but effective. Designed to operate entirely through Telegram, it delivers AI-generated trade signals based on a mix of social sentiment, exchange activity, and volume shifts. The model does not promise guaranteed profits or use overhyped language. It observes, analyzes, and delivers signals in plain format, which has made it attractive to early-stage users who are not looking for heavy dashboards or complex setups. What separates Snorter from similar tools is its learning loop. The AI continuously processes trade outcomes and sentiment trends, refining its call accuracy in real time. It supports major tokens and is gradually expanding its list based on user demand and performance data. The utility of the token extends beyond simple access. Holding Snorter’s native token unlocks faster alerts, deeper analytics, and advanced filters that retail traders would typically only get from paid terminals. This makes it more than just a bot; it becomes an affordable, token-driven platform for rapid trade insight. In a country like Japan, where the Financial Services Agency has begun refining the legal framework for crypto services and where traders are increasingly exploring token analytics, Snorter could be well suited for adoption. Telegram usage is widespread, and the local investor base is already showing interest in fast, mobile-first trading companions that do not require heavy technical understanding. If Snorter continues to evolve its AI system and respects data transparency, Japan could become one of its most responsive early markets. Solaxy Solaxy is a Layer 2 project designed to reduce congestion and cost on both Ethereum and Solana, but its approach to the problem is what sets it apart. Instead of launching with lofty promises about being faster or cheaper than everything else, Solaxy focuses on practical compatibility. It allows developers and users to carry out transactions across both chains without needing two wallets, multiple bridges, or token conversions that often confuse users. The system works through a smart transfer mechanism that recognizes the source network and completes the process in the destination format. Gas fees are adjusted automatically, and contracts are pre-verified on both chains. This cuts down on delays and lowers the cost of managing digital assets across platforms. $SOLX has got what YOU need. 🛸🪐45M Raised! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/hamUNI7Hgz — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) June 6, 2025 Having raised more than $45 million at the time of writing, Solaxy also provides a built-in staking module with flexible options. Unlike locked pool models that require long commitments, Solaxy lets users withdraw their funds at preset intervals without incurring penalties. It supports both SOL and ETH-based tokens, which makes it appealing to users who operate in multichain environments. This type of flexibility is likely to gain attention in regions where adoption is tied to convenience and user familiarity. With Japanese regulators showing interest in crypto products that follow structured models and reduce user friction, projects like Solaxy may find support from both developers and investors looking for scalable infrastructure. The token, SOLX, is already gaining interest from several early-stage funds, and the project’s roadmap suggests that it is preparing for regional partnerships once testing phases are complete. BTC Bull BTC Bull is a memecoin with direction. It does not attempt to reshape blockchain infrastructure or build an exchange. It exists to amplify the Bitcoin philosophy through cultural symbols, staking mechanics, and fixed-supply tokenomics. The tone is light, but the structure is deliberate. Its tokenomics are capped and publicly audited. Rewards are distributed based on participation, and staking is built to refresh consistently, avoiding long-term locking or confusing yield curves. While many community tokens rely purely on social traction, BTC Bull merges that approach with simplicity in design. The token runs on a clean model. There are no taxes, no burns, no liquidity traps. It allows early participants to enter with clarity, while maintaining a system that is self-contained and easy to audit. Japan’s rising interest in Bitcoin and its newly introduced regulatory adjustments provide a potential backdrop for a project like BTC Bull to catch attention. Investors in the country have been steadily increasing their crypto exposure, and with public companies like MetaPlanet committing to Bitcoin accumulation, cultural alignment with Bitcoin is growing stronger. Projects that mirror that alignment without the baggage of overengineering may find support from Japanese retail investors who value community but still prefer transparency. BTC Bull remains early in its presale stage. The fundamentals are visible, the audits are done, and the structure is complete. As countries like Japan continue to expand access to crypto in structured ways, projects with clear intent and clean delivery could find the path to adoption far smoother. Conclusion The increase in Japan’s institutional interest and retail participation, along with a steady rise in crypto-related activity across Asia, shows that digital assets are no longer a Western-dominated trend. With regulatory clarity improving and local demand expanding, the market is opening up on multiple fronts. This shift could bring more attention and capital to undervalued altcoins.

The firm, calling itself Europe’s first Bitcoin treasury company, will raise funds using a method similar to the U.S. “At the Market” (ATM) model. Shares will be issued under market conditions by a designated counterparty, with pricing based on the higher of the previous day’s close or the volume-weighted average, and limited to 21% of daily trading volume. Just last week, the company added $68 million in Bitcoin to its treasury, pushing its total stash to 1,471 BTC—currently worth more than $154 million. Other major players are also ramping up their BTC holdings. Strategy, led by Michael Saylor, is targeting $1 billion in fresh funds to expand its already massive Bitcoin position. The company currently holds over $61 billion in BTC, accounting for 2.76% of all Bitcoin in circulation. Despite Bitcoin cooling off after hitting a record $112,000 on May 22, industry experts say institutional interest remains strong. According to Nexo’s Stella Zlatareva, strategic accumulation and infrastructure investments continue to support the long-term bullish case. Bitcoin has recently bounced from the $103,000 level, showing resilience.

2025-06-09T10:34:00,"Democratizing AI: Google Cloud’s Powerful Vision for Agent Development","BitcoinWorld Democratizing AI: Google Cloud’s Powerful Vision for Agent Development In the dynamic world where technology constantly pushes boundaries, the convergence of fields like AI and digital assets is creating new possibilities. At Bitcoin World Sessions: AI, a key theme emerged: the critical need for accessible artificial intelligence. Google Cloud’s Iliana Quinonez shed light on the company’s vision for democratizing AI agent development , emphasizing its importance for organizational progress and collaborative workflows. This isn’t just a technical discussion; it’s about unlocking potential for businesses and innovators everywhere. Why is Democratizing AI Agent Development Crucial? Historically, creating sophisticated AI solutions required specialized skills, significant investment, and complex infrastructure. This limited the benefits of AI to large corporations or research institutions. Google Cloud believes that for AI to truly transform industries, it must be accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical background or company size. The rationale behind democratizing AI is multifaceted: Accelerated Innovation: More people building AI agents means more diverse ideas and faster development cycles. Increased Adoption: Easier tools lead to wider use of AI across different sectors and business functions. Level Playing Field: Small and medium-sized businesses can compete by leveraging AI without needing massive R&D budgets. Addressing Talent Gap: Simplified platforms help bridge the shortage of highly specialized AI engineers. What Exactly Are AI Agents? Before diving deeper, it’s helpful to understand what an AI agent is. Unlike a simple program that follows explicit instructions, an AI agent is designed to: Perceive its environment: It can take in information from various sources. Make decisions: Based on its programming and learned data, it chooses actions. Act to achieve goals: It performs tasks to reach a specific objective. Learn and adapt (often): Many agents can improve their performance over time through experience. Think of them as intelligent assistants capable of handling complex tasks, automating workflows, or interacting with users or other systems autonomously to achieve defined outcomes. This capability is fundamental for modern AI for business applications. How Google Cloud AI is Enabling Accessibility Google Cloud is building the foundation to make AI agent development more accessible. Their approach involves providing a suite of tools, platforms, and infrastructure designed to lower the technical barriers. Key aspects include: Managed Services: Offering services that handle the complexities of infrastructure management, allowing developers to focus on building the AI logic. Pre-trained Models: Providing access to powerful, pre-built AI models that can be customized or used off-the-shelf, reducing the need to train models from scratch. Intuitive Development Environments: Creating user-friendly interfaces and tools that simplify the process of designing, building, testing, and deploying AI agents. Scalable Infrastructure: Providing the necessary computing power and storage that can scale with the needs of AI applications, from small projects to large-scale deployments. This focus by Google Cloud AI is transforming the landscape, making sophisticated AI capabilities available to a broader audience. Tangible Benefits of Accessible AI Agents Making AI agent development easier translates into real-world benefits for organizations: Increased Efficiency: Automate repetitive or complex tasks. Streamline workflows across departments. Improve data processing and analysis speed. Enhanced Collaboration: Agents can act as intelligent intermediaries between systems or teams. Facilitate better communication and information sharing. Support human decision-making with data-driven insights. Accelerated Innovation: Rapid prototyping and testing of new AI-powered services. Easier experimentation with different AI models and approaches. Faster deployment of innovative solutions to market. Improved Customer Experiences: Deploy intelligent chatbots or virtual assistants. Personalize services based on user behavior. Provide faster and more accurate support. These benefits highlight why accessible AI for business is not just a technical goal, but a strategic imperative. What Does This Mean for the Future of AI? The push towards democratized AI agent development is shaping the future of AI in profound ways. We can expect to see: Ubiquitous AI: AI agents will become integrated into more software, services, and devices. Specialized Agents: A proliferation of highly specific agents designed for niche tasks or industries. Human-AI Collaboration: Increased focus on how humans and AI agents can work together effectively, rather than AI simply replacing human roles. New Business Models: The emergence of companies built around providing or utilizing easily developed AI agents. This future envisions a world where AI is not a mysterious black box but a powerful, flexible tool available to a much wider population of creators and users. Navigating the Path to Accessible AI: Challenges and Considerations While the vision of democratized AI is exciting, challenges remain. Organizations adopting or building AI agents must consider: Data Privacy and Security: Ensuring sensitive data is handled responsibly and securely by AI agents. Ethical AI Development: Building agents that are fair, transparent, and accountable. Skill Development: Even with simpler tools, understanding AI concepts and best practices is necessary. Integration Complexity: Integrating new AI agents into existing systems and workflows can still be challenging. Addressing these points is crucial for realizing the full potential of accessible AI. Getting Started with Accessible AI Agent Development For individuals and organizations looking to explore this space, Google Cloud and others are providing resources. Start by exploring available platforms and tools, experimenting with simple agent tasks, and focusing on clear business problems that AI can solve. Learning basic AI concepts and understanding data requirements are valuable first steps. Conclusion: Unlocking Potential Through Accessibility Google Cloud’s vision for democratizing AI agent development , as highlighted at Bitcoin World Sessions: AI, is a significant step towards a future where the transformative power of AI is available to a much broader audience. By lowering barriers to entry, providing robust tools through Google Cloud AI , and fostering innovation, the path is being cleared for organizations of all sizes to leverage AI for business advancement. This accessibility is not just changing how we build AI; it’s fundamentally reshaping the future of AI itself, promising increased efficiency, enhanced collaboration, and unprecedented innovation across industries.

As of Monday, June 9, 2025, Bitcoin is trading at $106,830, up 1.6% over the past 24 hours, according to the latest market data. Daily trading volume currently stands at $39.45 billion, a healthy 9.67% increase, reflecting building interest around a potential breakout. Bitcoin 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold Crypto strategist Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) highlighted the importance of the $106,500 level, calling it a key technical barrier that BTC must clear to reignite its uptrend. “I assume that we’ll be starting to see a strong rally the moment that Bitcoin breaks through the crucial barrier of $106,500,” van de Poppe commented. In a recent chart update, van de Poppe explained that this level previously acted as strong support after Bitcoin’s first all-time high of the cycle. However, after multiple failed breakout attempts in recent sessions, it has flipped into resistance. “Break above this level is vital as this was the support level after the first ATH,” he wrote. “As you can see, multiple tests have been done to break through it and sellers have been winning. The next time the test happens, we’re likely going to see a strong breakout resulting in the next uptrend and new ATHs.” Bitcoin critical resistance. Source: Michaël van de Poppe Classic Bitcoin support and resistance The pattern reflects classic technical dynamics, where former support becomes resistance. A decisive move through $106,500 to perhaps turning $107,000 into support could signal renewed momentum for Bitcoin, with bulls eyeing new highs in the coming weeks. For now, traders and investors are watching closely as BTC hovers just below this pivotal level, poised for what could be a crucial breakout attempt.

2025-06-09T10:20:35,"NASDAQ pushes for an XRP ETF","On June 2, NASDAQ filed a rule change proposal with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking to expand the benchmark for the Hashdex NASDAQ Crypto Index US ETF (NCIQ). Currently tracking only Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), the updated exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) would instead follow the more inclusive NASDAQ Crypto Index (NCI), also comprising ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ), and Cardano ( ADA ), among others. The SEC is reviewing the proposal under Rule 19b-4 and has until November 2, 2025, to make a decision. At press time, XRP is trading at $2.24, a modest 1.70% gain over the past 24 hours, and 5% as in the week since June 2, potentially fueled by optimism over potential index inclusion. XRP 24-day price performance. Source: Finbold Potential XRP ETFs If approved, the fund could mark a significant step forward toward mainstream altcoin inclusion in regulated investment products. Recall that a federal court reaffirmed that XRP does not qualify as a security in April this year, so any new developments are a hot topic among investors. For example, Matt Hougan, the chief investment officer at Bitwise, recently stated that institutional investors were looking to expand beyond just BTC and expressed hope we might see altcoin ETFs by the end of the year. Bitcoin, Hougan argued, is a ‘great hedge’, and investors are happy to embrace it, but blockchain has more to offer in terms of exposure. XRP, for instance, is a popular choice for cross-border payments, while SOL tends to be leveraged for scalable smart contracts. The NASDAQ filing also revealed two leadership changes at Hashdex Asset Management Ltd., the sponsor of the Hashdex NASDAQ Crypto Index US ETF. It remains to be seen whether these changes will affect the outcome.

Altcoins saw mixed action, with XRP jumping 3%, Solana and Avalanche ticking higher, but BNB and Dogecoin slipping by around 2%. All eyes are on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) data for May, which could shape market sentiment and impact the Federal Reserve’s next move.

This comes as the effects of the Trump-era tariffs begin to show, with businesses passing on higher import costs to consumers. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy, is estimated to have increased by 0.3% in May, its biggest rise in four months. The PPI report will follow a day later, offering further insights into inflation at the producer level. If the data comes in hotter than expected, it could reduce the chances of the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates during its policy meeting on June 17–18. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : US-China Trade Talks Begin Today — Will Bitcoin and Ethereum React? , Bitcoin and Ethereum Stay Calm Despite Big Week Even with all these macro signals, the crypto market is staying calm.

Both BTC and ETH are holding steady as investors wait for clearer signals from the Fed and inflation data. Key Crypto Events This Week Moreover, this week isn’t just about inflation. On June 9, the SEC will host a roundtable called “DeFi and the American Spirit,” discussing how decentralized finance fits into the U.S. financial system. Meanwhile, lawmakers will discuss the Crypto Market Structure Bill, which could define how digital assets are regulated moving forward. A decision on the proposed Litecoin Spot ETF is also expected, though likely to be delayed. Lastly, MicroStrategy plans to raise $1 billion to grow its Bitcoin holdings. Together, these events make this a critical week for both crypto prices and policy. Investors are now keeping an eye on tariffs with Trump’s trade deal deadline coming up next month. Meanwhile, the Senate is focusing on Trump’s “ Big, Beautiful ” budget plan, which has drawn criticism from Elon Musk. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Higher-than-expected CPI often signals inflation, potentially leading the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, which can make riskier assets like crypto less attractive.

2025-06-09T10:16:33,"Ethereum June price prediction: Key levels to watch right now","Just six months ago, in December 2024, Ethereum was riding high at around $4,000 — right in the middle of a major crypto rally as Bitcoin soared past $100,000. Fast forward to early June 2025, and things aren’t quite as rosy. Still, it’s a big improvement from April, when ETH dropped all the way down to $1,580. So, where could ETH be headed next? To help you make sense of the current market and plan your next move, we’ve put together this short-term Ethereum June price prediction. Table of Contents What is Ethereum? ETH price factors for June Ethereum crypto price prediction: general outlook Ethereum price prediction: June 2025 What is Ethereum? Put simply, Ethereum is a blockchain-based platform for building all kinds of apps and services using smart contracts — self-executing code that runs without the need for middlemen. The cryptocurrency that powers this system is also called Ethereum ( ETH ). Ethereum isn’t just a digital coin — it’s the foundation for a wide range of blockchain projects. Think of it as the internet for decentralized apps, and ETH as the fuel that keeps it running. As of June 9th 2025, ETH is trading at $2,523, up about 0.61% in the past 24 hours and 1.25% in the last week. ETH 1-day chart, June 2025 | Source: crypto.news What’s going to shape the Ethereum price prediction for June? Is Ethereum a good investment? ETH price factors for June As of June 4, 2025, Ethereum’s price is being influenced by some big moves.The Pectra upgrade, which launched on May 7, brought key improvements like higher validator staking limits and faster, more efficient transactions. Not only did this give ETH’s price a quick boost, but it also made the network stronger and more scalable for the long haul. On top of that, excitement around spot Ethereum ETFs is getting institutions more interested, which is adding some positive vibes to the market. Of course, bigger factors like inflation, interest rates, and how strong the U.S. dollar is still play a big role in how investors feel and how ETH moves. You might also like: Ethereum price eyes breakout from Ascending Triangle with $3,760 in sight So, what can we expect from ETH throughout the rest of June? Will Ethereum go up or down? Ethereum crypto price prediction: general outlook About a month after the Pectra upgrade, ETH’s price has risen by 42.5%. However, over the past week, it has dipped slightly, down by 1.5%. As of today, June 4, as mentioned earlier, the price is sitting at $2,613. According to analysis by crypto.news, Ethereum is now in a critical phase, forming an ascending triangle — a bullish pattern characterized by higher lows and a horizontal resistance. With momentum building and resistance at $2,800, a breakout could be imminent. If ETH breaks above this level with strong volume, it could trigger a rally toward the next major target around $3,760. Given these factors, what does the Ethereum price prediction for June 2025 look like according to analytical sites? Ethereum price prediction: June 2025 CoinCodex’s Ethereum coin price prediction suggests that ETH could rise this month, with the potential to gain 7.2% and reach $2,830.10 by July 3. The ETH price prediction for June 5 leans bullish, with 25 technical indicators signaling a potential rebound, while only 4 suggest a possible decline. According to DigitalCoinPrice’s Ethereum price forecast, ETH could increase by approximately 27.2% by the end of June, reaching a price of $3,318.5. Wallet Investor’s ETH projections are positive as well, suggesting that the coin could reach a maximum price of $3,155.90 by early July. Should you invest in Ethereum? The recent Pectra upgrade gave the network a solid boost. And even though ETH dipped slightly over the past week, it’s still up an impressive 42.5% this past month, currently trading at $2,613. Chart watchers are seeing signs of a potential breakout above $2,800 — and if that happens, ETH could climb toward $3,760. Forecasts from sites like CoinCodex, DigitalCoinPrice, and Wallet Investor are leaning bullish too. Of course, there are always risks, but ETH expectations for June look promising, especially if you’re keeping an eye on short-term opportunities.

2025-06-09T10:15:47,"Clarity Act heads to Tuesday’s vote with new amendments","The CLARITY Act, aimed at providing a more stable regulatory framework for digital assets, received a major overhaul on the evening of June 8. The Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute (ANS) was released ahead of Tuesday’s high-stakes markup in the House Financial Services Committee. According to a recent post on X by FOX Business reporter Eleanor Terrett, this updated version of the CLARITY Act will serve as the foundation for the committee’s deliberations. She also clarified that this version is the most recent version from the House Financial Services Committee. There is another version from the House Agriculture Committee, which will be marked up separately. Both committees will review and make changes to their versions on Tuesday. After that, the two versions will be merged into one final bill. The new version features fresh definitions and tweaks expected to significantly influence agencies’ oversight of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and decentralized finance. This hearing will set the direction for future crypto regulation as the bill moves into a key stage in lawmaking. New crypto law clarifies token classification and empowers agencies This new framework of the CLARITY Act defines which digital tokens are “digital commodities” and which ones are “securities” to identify the responsibilities between the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). These new and clear roles make it easier for companies to comply with the rules and for regulators to enforce them because they reduce confusion and disagreements about how tokens should be classified under existing laws. The amendment introduces an “investment contract asset” that avoids classifying certain digital tokens as securities contracts to define rules more appropriate for their function. It also creates a system of provisional registration under the CFTC for digital commodity brokers, exchanges, dealers, and custodians. This allows these firms to continue operating legally while the new rules are implemented during the transition period. Additionally, the amendment clarifies that certain decentralized finance (DeFi) activities are exempt from registration requirements to promote innovation in the DeFi space. This is because developers, validators, and non-custodial service providers can build and run their projects without permission from the SEC or the CFTC. The CLARITY Act helps protect investors from unfair practices with its new restrictions on insider sales for tokens in the early stages before they become stable and widely used (blockchain maturity). To ensure each agency focuses on its roles, the law gives the CFTC full control over spot markets that trade digital commodities and some stablecoins. At the same time, the SEC keeps authority over securities offerings and cases of fraud. Furthermore, the amendment reverses the SAB 121 guidance by demanding companies provide better disclosures to consumers about the risks and details of digital assets. It also improves how companies must hold and protect digital assets in custody and introduces safeguards that prevent companies from treating user assets as liabilities on their balance sheets. The amendment to the CLARITY Act also unites companies and regulators to work on new technologies by adding “innovation” to the SEC’s public interest mission and making the LabCFTC program a permanent resource. Revised CLARITY Act heads to crucial Committee vote The new substitute text of the CLARITY Act was uploaded to the website on June 8, 2025. This provides members sufficient time to study the revised bill and consider its contents with stakeholders and affected parties before the critical mark-up on June 10 within the House Financial Services Committee. If the amendment passes, it would become the underlying text for lawmakers to debate and vote on further in the committee. That would be a very serious step toward clear, sensible regulation of cryptocurrency and digital assets in the US. This new amendment proves that lawmakers across political parties are willing to work together on this issue despite previous partisan disagreements. The sponsors include Representative Republican from Arkansas, French Hill, who has gained bipartisan support from New York Democrat Representative Ritchie Torres. Many policy observers and industry leaders compare the bill to the Senate’s GENIUS Act . This bill also aims to close regulatory gaps that have left the market vulnerable to fraud and uncertainty with its rules that cover the full range of digital assets. The revised CLARITY Act reduces confusion and overlaps that caused problems in the past by addressing demands for legal certainty and innovation-friendly regulations. It also gives a clear division of regulatory responsibilities between the SEC and CFTC. Tuesday’s vote will reveal the House Financial Services Committee has enough willpower to move past gridlock. It will also make meaningful progress toward creating a regulatory framework that protects consumers, supports innovation, and strengthens the crypto industry.

Bitcoin (BTC) started the day with a marginal increase, trading around $105,490. The flagship currency faced a significant decline last week, plunging to a low of $100,424 before rebounding. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) fell below $2,500 as selling pressure intensified. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is down nearly 1%, trading at around $2,490. Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL) have bucked the bearish trend, up 2.39% and 0.50%. Cardano (ADA) is also marginally up, while Dogecoin (DOGE) is down over 1%, trading around $0.181. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable declines, while Toncoin (TON) and Hedera (HBAR) registered marginal increases. Argentinian Authorities Rule Out Foul Play In President Javier Milei’s Crypto Promo Argentina’s federal anti-corruption authority has ruled out foul play in President Javier Milei’s support of the Libra token. The anti-corruption office stated that Milei’s endorsement of the token was made in a personal capacity and did not use federal resources. The office, which operates under a government ministry, stated that Milei’s promotion of the token did not violate federal ethics laws governing public officials. However, a separate investigation remains ongoing. President Milei had posted about the Libra token minutes after its launch, sending its value soaring. He also called it an endeavor to boost Argentine economic expansion by assisting startups and small enterprises with investments made possible through blockchain technology. However, the buzz around the token was short-lived as the token’s founders, who controlled 70% of the supply, liquidated their holdings. The selloff triggered a massive collapse, causing losses between $100 million and $250 million. House Democrats Concerned About CLARITY Act House Democrats on the House Financial Services Committee held a “minority day” hearing on Friday to discuss a pending crypto market structure bill and concerns about its wide-ranging implications for the US securities markets. The Committee’s Republican majority convened most hearings about the bill. The “minority day” hearing allows Democrats to highlight the perceived flaws of the proposed legislation. Democrat witnesses highlighted concerns about the knock-on effects of such a strategy, with Amanda Fischer, Policy Director at Better Markets stating during testimony that the bill’s “regulatory gaps will not be quarantined to crypto.” Fischer stated that by carving crypto from US securities laws that have existed since the 1930s, the CLARITY Act would incentivize traditional financial institutions to shoehorn functions like capital raising onto blockchain networks to dodge regulation and lower costs. She highlighted comments by Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, who stated, “The cost of running a crypto business is an order of magnitude lower. You don’t have to squint too hard to imagine a world where stocks are on blockchains.” Fischer countered stating, “He doesn't have to pay for customer protection, SEC exams, or SIPC insurance. Of course, it's cheaper.” The panel also flagged the act’s two-tiered system for categorizing crypto assets. The bill classifies most crypto tokens as digital commodities, exempting them from SEC regulation. However, token issuers who want to engage in activities resembling a traditional securities offering can register as “mature blockchain systems” with the SEC, a process with more stringent compliance requirements. Fischer argues that few token issuers will engage with a rigorous compliance process, given the CLARITY Act offers many loopholes for issuers. “Crypto issuers will claim they're DeFi; claim that they're not offering investment contracts; claim that they're collectibles or meme coins; claim that they’re airdrops, or claim that they're subject to the [bill’s] grandfathering provision.” Department Of Justice Files Civil Forfeiture Claim Seeking $7.7M In Crypto The US Department of Justice has filed a civil forfeiture claim for over $7.7 million in crypto laundered by North Korean IT workers who gained employment with companies in the US using fraudulent means. The funds were seized as part of an operation against a North Korean plot to evade sanctions. Authorities had indicted a North Korean Foreign Trade Bank representative, Sim Hyon Sop, in connection with the operation. According to the Department of Justice, North Korean IT workers used fraudulent identities to gain employment with US crypto firms. They then laundered their income through Sim, sending it to the regime in Pyongyang. The forfeiture complaint also states that North Korean IT workers had been deployed in several locations across the world, including China, Russia, and Laos. Sue J. Bai, the head of the DOJ’s National Security Division, stated, “For years, North Korea has exploited global remote IT contracting and cryptocurrency ecosystems to evade U.S. sanctions and bankroll its weapons programs.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has made a muted start to the week, with the price marginally down. Despite subdued price action, BTC has maintained its position above $105,000. However, the flagship cryptocurrency risks a drop below $105,000, with the US-China trade talks setting the tone for the week. The trade talks could become a highly volatile catalyst for BTC and the broader crypto market, with the potential to create sharp price movements. Analysts believe that BTC’s current price action is unstable. Dominick John, an analyst at Kronos Research, stated, “Trading above $105K signals strength, but the structure remains fragile. With the Fear & Greed Index at 55, sentiment has balanced markets in a wait-and-see mode, looking for a macro trigger or confirmation of trend.” Kay Lu, CEO of HashKey Eco Labs believes BTC is trading within a delicate range around key support levels. Investors are also nervous and could sell their holdings at the hint of bearish market developments. However, on-chain data shows that Bitcoin’s price support of above $105,000 has been bolstered by institutions adopting the asset and adding it to their corporate treasuries. Min Jung, an analyst at Presto Research, stated, “BTC has been supported by the ‘BTC for Corporations’ narrative, with more companies following Strategy’s playbook.” BTC’s short-term price action and volatility will be shaped by upcoming macroeconomic events. Volatility will pick up midweek, with the US Consumer Price Index and the Producer Price Index numbers due to be published. “We could see volatility pick up mid-week … Both CPI and PPI are on the calendar, and any upside surprise in inflation data could weigh on risk assets broadly, including crypto.” These indicators could provide insights into whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates during its next meeting. However, analysts expect the Fed to leave interest rates unchanged. BTC registered a sharp decline as it entered the previous weekend, dropping over 2% on Thursday (May 29) and 1.51% on Friday to slip below the 20-day SMA and $105,000 and settle at $104,067. Despite the selling pressure, the price recovered over the weekend, rising 0.69% on Saturday and 0.95% on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,779. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $103,768 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $105,902. The price was back in the red on Tuesday, falling 0.44% to $105,436. Source: TradingView Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC fell almost 1%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,752. Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as the price fell 3%, dropping to an intraday low of $100,424 before settling at $101,614. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Friday, rising almost 3% to recoup most of its losses and settle at $104,378. The price continued to push higher on Saturday, increasing 1.15% to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,575. BTC could only register a marginal increase on Sunday and has fallen back into the red during the ongoing session, trading around $105,596. A drop below $105,000 could cause BTC to plunge to $100,000 or lower. On the other hand, buyers will look to regain control and push the price towards $110,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum’s (ETH) decline continued as it extended Sunday’s losses, falling below $2,500. ETH has been subdued in recent sessions after struggling to recover from a substantial 7% drop on Thursday, which saw the price plunge to a low of $2,393. ETH investors are cautiously consolidating as the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency tests a key support level at $2,500. Despite ETH’s subdued price action, institutional interest in the asset has registered a notable uptick. Ethereum ETFs have registered consistent inflows, with data from SoSoValue revealing inflows worth $281 million just last week alone. Institutional interest goes beyond ETFs, with companies beginning to buy ETH for their treasuries. SharpLink Gaming, a Nasdaq-listed company, recently announced a $425 million funding round to buy ETH. US-based Abraxas Capital also increased its ETH holdings to over $800 million. The altcoin is trading at the lower end of its trading range but has strong support at these levels. ETH raced to an intraday high of $2,790 on Thursday (May 29) as buyers attempted a move past $2,800. It lost momentum at this level and fell nearly 2% to $2,632. Bearish sentiment intensified on Friday as ETH plunged almost 4%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $2,600 to $2,532. The price registered a marginal decline on Saturday before rising 0.44% to end the weekend at $2,539. ETH rebounded on Monday, rising 2.66% to reclaim $2,600, cross the 20-day SMA and settle at $2,607. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped 0.53% on Tuesday to settle at $2,593. Source: TradingView ETH recovered on Wednesday, reaching an intraday high of $2,679 before settling at $2,607, ultimately registering a marginal increase. Bearish sentiment returned on Thursday as ETH plunged over 7%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $2,415, but not before hitting an intraday low of $2,415. However, it recovered on Friday, rising nearly 3% to $2,479. The price continued to push higher on Saturday, increasing 1.87% to reclaim $2,500 and settle at $2,525. Price action turned bearish on Sunday as ETH registered a marginal decline and fell to $2,511. The current session sees ETH down almost 1%, trading around $2,492. If ETH regains momentum, it could push towards $2,600. A break above this level could see the price surge to $2,800. However, if support does not hold, ETH could slip below $2,400. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) continued its upward trajectory over the weekend but has lost momentum during the ongoing session, starting the week in the red. SOL registered a sharp decline on Thursday, plunging to a low of $141 before recovering over the weekend to reclaim $150 and end Sunday at $152. If bullish sentiment returns, analysts predict a move to $160. However, if sellers retain control, the price could continue to decline and test $140. SOL has traded downwards since being rejected from $180 and the 200-day SMA. The altcoin registered a sharp decline on Wednesday (May 28) and Thursday, falling to $166. Bearish sentiment intensified on Friday as the price plunged over 6%, slipping below $160 and settling at $156. The weekend saw volatility as sellers attempted to overwhelm buyers. However, SOL registered a marginal increase on Saturday and rose almost 1% on Sunday despite falling to a low of $150 to settle at $157. Price action turned bearish on Monday, and SOL registered a marginal decline to settle at $156, but not before dropping to a low of $151. The price raced to an intraday high of $164 on Tuesday but lost momentum, falling over 1% to $155. Source: TradingView Sellers retained control on Wednesday as SOL fell 1.29% to $153. Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as the price plunged nearly 6%, slipping below $150 and settling at $144. Despite the bearish sentiment, SOL recovered on Friday, rising 2.47% and settling at $147. Price action remained bullish over the weekend as SOL rose 1.51% on Saturday and 1.56% on Sunday to reclaim $150 and settle at $152. However, it is back in the red during the ongoing session, with the price down over 1%, as sellers look to drive it below $150. Bittensor (TAO) Price Analysis Bittensor (TAO) fell below the 20-day SMA on Thursday (May 29) and settled at $414. Selling pressure intensified on Friday as the price fell over 9%, slipping below $400 and the 200-day SMA and settling at $376. TAO recovered on Saturday, surging over 14% to reclaim $400, cross the 200-day SMA and settle at $430. However, it could not cross the 20-day SMA and was back in the red on Sunday, dropping almost 4% to end the weekend at $414. The price declined on Monday, falling 2.51% to $403. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as TAO fell over 4%, slipping below $400 and the 200-day SMA and settling at $386. Source: TradingView Buyers attempted a recovery on Wednesday as the price reached an intraday high of $399 but lost momentum after reaching this level, ultimately settling at $380.

2025-06-09T10:05:39,"Trump family makes peace with wallet team post-public fallout","Donald Trump’s crypto brand has been hogging headlines all week, thanks to the public spat between his family and the team behind a wallet project tied to the president. However, following all the drama, tensions seem to be easing. The crypto wallet saga involving Donald Trump’s sons and Gettrumpmemes, the company in charge of the memecoin tied to the president recently took a new turn, when Eric Trump took to social media platform X with a reconciliation post. “I am proud to announce the $TRUMP Meme Coin has aligned with @WorldLibertyFi,” he wrote . Eric’s post came only a few days after the family publicly rallied against the firm for launching a crypto wallet tied to their brand without authorization. At the time, the Trumps accused Gettrumpmeme’s partnership with Magic Eden of having “zero involvement” with their organization, even resorting to l egal action to thwart the initiative. You might also like: Bitcoin leads crypto market slump as Trump and Musk trade punches While he confirmed that the wallet project itself will not move forward, the shift in tone came alongside his announcement that their DeFi venture, World Liberty Financial, will acquire a significant stake in the $TRUMP memecoin. According to him, this symbolizes the duo’s joint “vision for crypto, patriotism, and long-term success.” However, Eric’s announcement has once again sparked criticism around the family’s crypto ventures. Skeptics argue that the majority of the projects involved lack transparency and are riddled with inconsistencies, questioning whether they are primarily driven by personal profit rather than genuine interest in the crypto industry. ""Plans to acquire"". Yes, they warn you before buying, just for them to buy higher afterwards…. Makes sense. Such nice people lol. Another obvious manipulation to grab more cash from retail. Even if it pumps and you have a bag, I would advice ou to take profit as soon as you… — Miles (@Miles__Tweet) June 7, 2025 This sentiment reflects the broader skepticism across the community, with many viewing the ventures as more opportunistic than authentic. Despite the announcement, the $TRUMP token has recorded no notable price movement. At press time, it trades around 77% below its all-time high and is down nearly 30% over the past 30 days.

2025-06-09T10:00:04,"Ethiopia prepares to regulate crypto despite ongoing ban","Ethiopia’s Financial Intelligence Service is preparing to regulate virtual currencies, despite their ongoing ban in the country. As initially reported by The Reporter Ethiopia, Ethiopia’s Financial Intelligence Service has announced that preparations are underway to regulate virtual currencies, despite their continued illegality under current Ethiopian law. The announcement was made by FIS Director Muluken Amare during a recent meeting of the Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group (ESAAMLG) in Addis Ababa, which brought together financial security officials from across the region to address emerging risks in the financial sector, including those posed by virtual assets. The FIS’s preparedness efforts are being conducted in collaboration with international partners, including the United Nations, Russia, and member states of ESAAMLG. The training focuses on equipping financial investigators and intelligence units with the skills to detect and respond to illegal uses of crypto, such as tax evasion , money laundering , and the financing of terrorism . The regional concern over the misuse of virtual currencies has been a key driver of these efforts. Muluken Yirga, a senior legal advisor to ESAAMLG, who also spoke at the meeting, said that terrorist organizations in the region have been using virtual currencies to bypass traditional financial systems, making it harder for authorities to trace and block illicit transactions. “There are different terrorist organizations operating in our region, including Al-Shabaab, Al-Qaeda, ISIL, and Daesh. These groups are increasingly using virtual currencies to raise and transfer funds,” said Muluken. You might also like: African crypto revolution continues as Ethiopia ranks among global BTC mining leaders While crypto trading is officially banned in Ethiopia, some transactions might still be taking place in the country. However, Amare noted that it cannot be assumed that all transactions involving virtual currencies are criminal unless they are tied to other offenses such as terrorism financing or fraud. “… As crypto technology is still new, some transactions may be occurring. That said, it cannot be assumed that all such transactions are illegal. The official currency of Ethiopia is Birr, and any virtual transactions conducted in other currencies are not authorized. If such transactions are linked to crimes such as terrorism or other illegal activities, investigations will be carried out accordingly.” Whether virtual currencies are eventually legalized or remain banned, the officials made it clear that the country must have mechanisms in place either to regulate them effectively or to enforce existing prohibitions.

2025-06-09T09:55:33,"John Deaton Reveals Major XRP Holdings Amid Bitcoin Debate","The post John Deaton Reveals Major XRP Holdings Amid Bitcoin Debate appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto community is buzzing as pro-Ripple attorney John Deaton discloses that he holds a “substantial” amount of XRP. His statement comes after he was challenged on X over his recent pro-Bitcoin comments, prompting the former Massachusetts Senate candidate to clarify where he truly stands. The post I’m quoting is about BTC so my comment is. I clearly own a substantial amount of XRP. I’m just not someone who sees the two as mutually exclusive. We will operate in a world of more than one coin. — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) June 9, 2025 More on this below! Bitcoin at $106K? Deaton Calls It the Safer Bet Deaton stirred conversation by stating that Bitcoin is a safer investment at $106,000 than it was at $20,000, a bold stance backed by his macroeconomic outlook. He points to rising debt levels and relentless fiat money printing as key reasons for Bitcoin’s long-term potential. He also cited recent U.S. policy shifts, including the pro-Bitcoin BITCOIN Act and growing institutional and state-level adoption, as signals of a strong bullish trend for the top cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Bonanza: Deaton’s Daring Investment Call Still, Deaton isn’t married to just one narrative. In a recent post, he emphasized that Bitcoin and XRP are not mutually exclusive, stating , “We will function in a realm with multiple coins.” His sentiment echoes that of Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, who recently urged XRP holders not to view the Bitcoin community as adversaries. This balanced stance reflects Deaton’s broader view of a multi-chain future, where competition doesn’t overshadow collaboration. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple Launches Japan-Focused Web3 Program Backed by JETRO , From Paycheck Struggles to Crypto Power Move Adding depth to his story, Deaton shared a personal anecdote – just 15 years ago, he lived paycheck to paycheck. Today, he has 80% of his net worth in Bitcoin and is actively involved in real estate deals to increase his BTC holdings, despite already buying at sub-$25,000 prices. While many speculate on aggressive Bitcoin strategies, Deaton draws a firm line: he does not support mortgaging homes to buy BTC – a statement he clarified wasn’t directed at industry figure David Bailey. What Deaton’s Dual Strategy Signals for Crypto Deaton’s approach captures the evolving dynamic of today’s crypto market: one where XRP’s regulatory win, which confirmed it as a non-security, now coexists with Bitcoin’s explosive 150% rise this year, driven by economic uncertainty and legislative momentum like the GENIUS Act . By backing both XRP and Bitcoin, Deaton stands as a bridge between two powerhouse communities, promoting strategic thinking. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-09T09:44:08,"The future of non-custodial models in a post-Coinbase world | Opinion","Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. As the dust settles from the latest wave of phishing attacks, breaches, and increasing regulatory pressure, one thing is becoming abundantly clear: the era of centralized custody in crypto is reaching an inflection point. Coinbase may still stand tall as the poster child of exchange-driven adoption, but its growing vulnerabilities expose a systemic flaw. Users are still being asked to trust a third party with their assets, privacy, and safety. In a post-Coinbase world, this trust model is no longer sustainable. You might also like: Rethinking money in the web3 era: From capital to code, narrative, and moral design | Opinion The next chapter of crypto centers around non-custodial infrastructure—models that return control to the user without sacrificing security, usability, or speed. The “not your keys, not your coins” ethos is evolving from a rallying cry into an architectural blueprint for the next generation of crypto platforms. The trust crisis and its ripple effects Recent events, such as the estimated $300 million in phishing-related losses on Coinbase , as highlighted by investigators like ZachXBT, indicate that centralized platforms are being pushed to serve as banks, tech firms, and compliance officers all at once. But in doing so, they inherit the worst vulnerabilities of each model. The trust users place in these intermediaries becomes a single point of failure, exploited not just by hackers but by misaligned incentives and opaque systems. We are now seeing users, especially the next wave of adopters, demanding platforms that work like Coinbase, but without the custody. They want seamless on/off ramps, intuitive UI, and fast swaps—but without giving up sovereignty over their funds. What a post-Coinbase model looks like Most so-called “non-custodial” platforms still expect users to jump through hoops just to do the basics. Meanwhile, centralized giants like Coinbase built empires by prioritizing ease of use over core crypto principles. That tradeoff is no longer acceptable. The real opportunity now is to build platforms that don’t ask users to choose between control and convenience. Crypto should be as simple as swapping tokens in seconds. No logins, no account creation, no handing over your identity to a black box. Most fiat on-ramps still funnel users through third parties that operate like banks in disguise. The future is wallet-native, not broker-driven. We need KYC and payments infrastructure that supports sovereignty, not platforms that treat users like liabilities to be monetized. And let’s kill the fantasy that users are going to “bridge,” “wrap,” and “unwrap” every time they move across chains. No one has time for that. Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), and Cosmos Hub ( ATOM ), they should all work from one interface, no jargon, no jumping through tabs. If your product still requires a tutorial, it’s not ready for mass adoption. Lastly, security can’t mean telling people “don’t forget your seed phrase” and calling it a day. That’s lazy. Non-custodial platforms must bake in real protection—recovery options, phishing defense, smart defaults, without turning every user into their own IT department. To get there, the tooling layer must evolve. Non-custodial platforms can’t just mimic Coinbase’s front end; they need an entirely different backend philosophy. That means embedded wallets that users don’t have to manually manage, programmable permissions that can restrict risky transactions, and cryptographic recovery mechanisms that don’t rely on centralized email resets or paper backups. This is not about dumbing down crypto; it’s about abstracting the complexity without obscuring the control. Technical breakthroughs exist, from threshold signatures and stealth addresses to social recovery, but they need to be productized in a way that puts real power in users’ hands without overwhelming them. Equally important is shifting the narrative from fear-based adoption to empowerment. Centralized platforms preyed on users’ uncertainty: “Let us handle it, it’s too complicated.” The next wave will win by saying, “You’ve got this, and we’ve got your back.” That mindset shift will define which wallets, dApps, and protocols earn user loyalty in the post-Coinbase era. Crypto’s first decade was built on the backs of early adopters willing to navigate clunky interfaces, obscure terminology, and high-friction workflows. But the next billion users won’t tolerate that. They expect web3 to meet the standards set by their favorite apps. This means fast, clean, intuitive, and secure by design. The infrastructure that powers non-custodial finance must learn from the best of web2, without importing its exploitative models. That means prioritizing UX alongside protocol design, and treating users not as endpoints, but as co-owners of the network. We cannot afford to be rebranding the old playbook anymore. The real shift is happening—in tools that feel as seamless as Coinbase, but don’t ask you to hand over your keys, your data, or your trust.

2025-06-09T09:39:00,"Coinbase Slashes Account Freezes by 82% Amid User Backlash","Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced that the cryptocurrency exchange has significantly reduced unnecessary user account freezes —by 82%—after acknowledging that the issue had persisted far too long. In a June 6 post on X, Armstrong admitted that addressing the problem had become a “top priority” and invited affected users to contact Coinbase Support directly. “For longer than is acceptable, account freezes have been a major issue,” Armstrong said . “We’ve now reduced this by 82%, with more improvements coming.” AI Drives Drop in Coinbase Account Freezes The substantial progress comes after Coinbase brought in Dor Levi, a product team member, nine weeks ago with a dedicated mission to fix the problem. Levi revealed that the team made “significant investments” in improving the company’s machine learning models and infrastructure to enhance accuracy and reduce false triggers that led to account restrictions. “We’ve improved the precision and recall of our models, and as a result, there are fewer freezes,” Levi explained. While Coinbase will continue to freeze accounts when legally required—such as due to court orders or sanctions—Levi acknowledged that the overall user experience still falls short. “As a Coinbase customer myself, it doesn’t yet meet my own bar,” he said. Despite the improvements, some users remain frustrated. One reported being locked out of their account for over two years, while another said they left Coinbase entirely after an eight-month freeze. A third blamed the poor customer service experience, citing long wait times and difficulty speaking to live support staff. Security Concerns Still Linger After Breach The timing of this update comes as Coinbase attempts to restore user confidence following a mass data breach that compromised over 70,000 customer accounts . In that incident, malicious actors bribed overseas customer service contractors to access sensitive personal information, including government-issued IDs and home addresses. Although the breach occurred in December, it was only publicly disclosed in May. One X user even claimed their family friend lost Bitcoin and Ether due to a scam linked to the stolen data. Coinbase, which serves over 100 million users and is the largest custodian of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., has committed to reinforcing its security protocols. But for now, reducing account freezes is seen as a major step toward regaining trust among its global user base.

In a new video update, Lee shares a long-term chart for TSLA, which suggests that even after its 40% drop from all-time highs, the stock’s price is simply retouching a support level from previous years. “Tesla investors are used to this. If you take a step back and look at Tesla from its 2010 to now, when it went from $1 to $280 today, that decline that we’re seeing recently really looks like it’s just coming back to support, so I don’t think the long-term picture really has changed all that much for Tesla.” Source: Fundstrat Capital/YouTube Lee goes on to list what he believes are several bullish fundamental developments for Tesla, adding that Fundstrat isn’t “too concerned’ about TSLA’s price dip. “Let’s just review the competitive strength. Tesla has the lead in EV design, the lead in manufacturing electric vehicles, they have a robotaxi product coming soon – it’s going to start next week – and they have a competitive, vastly more competitive robotaxi design that costs roughly one-fourth that of the nearest competitor. And Tesla is planning to introduce Optimus Robots… And of course, there are drones potentially in the future. So when you look at the suite of products that Tesla has, it is pretty unmatched, and then there’s the possibility that they may merge xAI, which is their AI (artificial intelligence) unit that also owns the platform X.com, formerly known as Twitter. And with all that, I would say that Tesla of course, still holds all of its advantages, and so we aren’t too concerned about the decline.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-09T09:11:01,"Bitcoin Pepe price outlook as Cathie Wood sees BTC hitting $1.5M","The broader cryptocurrency market edged slightly higher on Monday, though sentiment remains fragile as last week’s volatility continues to cast a shadow over price action. Attention is now centred on the high-stakes US-China trade negotiations taking place in London. Scheduled talks between US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng are being closely watched by traders. Bitcoin is attempting to hold above the $105,000 level as it consolidates recent losses. At last check, BTC was trading at $105,628, still below the critical resistance at $106,058 — the highest closing level since December. A sustained move above that threshold could shift momentum back in favour of bulls, but absent a breakout, the threat of another leg lower persists. Amid this volatility, Cathie Wood, Founder and CEO of ARK Investment Management, has reiterated her ultra-bullish stance on Bitcoin, projecting that the cryptocurrency could reach a valuation of at least $1.5 million by 2030. Such a massive rally with not only benefit Bitcoin investors but also the broader cryptocurrency market. In a scenario where Bitcoin surpasses the $1 million, high-risk, high-reward tokens like Bitcoin Pepe could stand to gain disproportionately. The rally would likely reignite speculative fervour across the crypto market, driving capital toward smaller, meme-infused tokens with potential for explosive returns. Bitcoin Pepe, in particular, sits at a confluence of two potent narratives: infrastructure-level association with Bitcoin and meme-driven cultural momentum. This dual positioning enhances its appeal during bull runs, where investor appetite for novelty and asymmetric upside tends to spike. Cathie Wood’s Bitcoin prediction In a recent appearance on The Diary of a CEO, ARK Investment Management founder and CEO Cathie Wood reiterated her bold thesis that Bitcoin could surge to at least $1.5 million by 2030, citing a range of macro and structural tailwinds supporting long-term adoption. Wood identified institutional demand as a key growth catalyst, pointing to increased involvement from corporate entities. She argued that Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a credible investment vehicle rather than a speculative asset. “Bitcoin is more of an investment because it does appreciate over time,” Wood said. “Now you go through [it], it’s volatile. No question. And that’s the first thing people have to know about it. But it is becoming less volatile as more and more investors hold it.” According to her, institutions are only beginning to move into the Bitcoin market, suggesting the current level of adoption is still in its early stages. She expects accelerating demand as fund managers and corporate treasuries seek exposure to an asset that offers both diversification and growth potential. Wood also framed Bitcoin as the first new asset class in centuries, contrasting it with traditional categories like equities, bonds, real estate, and commodities that have dominated financial markets since the 1600s. In her view, this historical shift reinforces Bitcoin’s structural appeal and sets the stage for exponential price appreciation over the coming years. Bitcoin Pepe shows no signs of slowing A renewed surge in Bitcoin, driven largely by institutional capital inflows, is once again igniting risk appetite across the broader cryptocurrency market. Among the beneficiaries of this cycle is Bitcoin Pepe — a project positioning itself at the convergence of meme coin culture and infrastructure development. As the first meme-centric Layer 2 network on Bitcoin, Bitcoin Pepe seeks to combine the base layer security of Bitcoin with the scalability of Solana-like architectures. The project has garnered attention not only for its narrative but also for its execution. It has raised over $14 million in its ongoing presale ahead of a scheduled listing announcement on June 17, a figure that underscores investor interest as speculative capital shifts toward early-stage, high-upside plays. To strengthen its Layer 2 ecosystem, Bitcoin Pepe has secured strategic partnerships with projects such as Super Meme, Catamoto, and Plena Finance. Bitcoin Pepe is banking on sustained momentum and heightened visibility from Bitcoin’s rally to propel it into the spotlight as a serious contender in the next wave of crypto speculation.

2025-06-09T09:07:28,"AVL price spikes as Avalon Labs initiates deflationary cycle with 80M token burn","The altcoin market remained indecisive on Monday as Bitcoin oscillated around $105K. Meanwhile, AVL decoupled with substantial gains, driven by bullish ecosystem developments. On 9 June, Avalon Labs confirmed permanently removing 80 million AVL tokens from the circulating supply. The move comes as the project braces for the next chapter of business expansion and enriched demand. Avalon Labs 🎩🔮 @avalonfinance_ · Follow Avalon Labs has officially burned 80M $AVL , representing 44% of the circulating supply. These unclaimed airdrop tokens, worth approximately $16 million, have now been permanently removed from circulation. Over the past year, a total of $20M worth of $AVL has been claimed by 7:20 AM · Jun 9, 2025 72 Reply Copy link Read 12 replies AVL signaled bullishness before the announcement as it climbed from yesterday’s low of $0.1718. The coin saw a sharp 16% jump from $0.1864 to $0.2169 after Avalon Labs confirmed the burn, extending its gains by 26% since 8 June lows. This article analyzes what happened, why it matters for AVL holders, and what Avalonians and the Web3 community can anticipate in the upcoming times. Avalon Lab’s strategic token burn Avalon Lab’s asset incineration isn’t a usual token burn. While projects like Shiba Inu have periodic schedules for these events, Avalon plans to destroy $16 million in assets that users left untouched from last year’s airdrops. Rather than leaving 80 million coins lingering within the ecosystem, Avalon has removed them from circulation, making AVL’s scarcer. Notably, the burn represented 44% of AVL’s total circulating supply. That massive reduction welcomes the digital currency into a deflationary phase. Deflation is bullish as it tightens supply over time, often encouraging long-term holders as the token’s value increases. The team stated that the latest burn ushers in a new phase of Business expansion. They explained: As AVL enters a deflationary cycle, more value will be unlocked, aligning long-term incentives and strengthening the foundation of our ecosystem. Indeed, reduced asset supply could trigger upside pressure for AVL’s price, especially with increased utility and demand. The remaining coins now boast a little more strength due to scarcity. Moreover, Avalon Labs trusts this is the initial step toward a broader economic position. Tightened tokenomics likely set the stage for a sustainable and more robust ecosystem. Meanwhile, Avalon has distributed AVL assets worth over $20 million to more than 100K users in the previous year. The significant airdrop signals the project’s close ties with its community. Thus, the latest token burn isn’t about cleansing the house. The move looks to incentivize Avalon’s loyal followers, who have been supportive since its early stages. The project even referred to its loyal supporters as “key stakeholders.” AVL price outlook The native token hovers at $0.2108 after brief corrections from intraday highs. The massive 24-hour trading volume indicates revived optimism in AVL. Chart by Coinmarketcap However, the broad market outlook suggests limited rallies for Avalon’s token. Bears control the crypto space, and possible profit-taking could see AVL losing its latest gains. However, Bitcoin’s stability and rallies above $105K would support AVL’s continued surges.

Analysts believe Bitcoin could surge past $115,000 in June. The latest U.S. jobs data is expected to weaken, raising the odds of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in the coming months. Early investors are shifting focus to Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP), a rising star in the meme coin space. BPEP is pioneering the PEP-20 token standard, which will enable native asset minting on Bitcoin with the ease and efficiency of Solana’s architecture. Bitcoin is gearing up for another big breakout! After dipping to $74,420 in April, it bounced back strong, shooting up over 50% to hit a fresh all-time high of $112,000 . Over the past two weeks, though, it’s taken a 10% dip. But hey, most analysts think it’s just a healthy cooldown after that wild rally. Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s price has reached crucial support of $100,000, coinciding with a strong technical indicator: the 50-day moving average. A strong bounce from this support could propel the asset to a new high of $115k in the coming weeks. US employment data is an important indicator for financial markets that could impact Bitcoin’s price action. The data impacts the Fed’s interest rate decision, influencing sentiment toward Bitcoin and financial assets. While Bitcoin is aiming for a strong rebound, investors are scanning for the best crypto to buy now. If you’re seeking a project with strong fundamentals and explosive growth potential, here are the top picks: Bitcoin bounces off the strong support: Is a new ATH coming? On Friday, Bitcoin strongly rebounded from the $100k support level, due to growing optimism for a new all-time high for the asset. The rally could be fueled by continuous institutional buying, and US job data is “weaker-than-expected.” Bitfinex analysts recently commented on the report, “In a bullish scenario, driven by strong institutional interest and ETF inflows, Bitcoin could touch $115,000 or higher by early July.” Further adding, “A stronger-than-expected report might delay rate cuts, strengthening the dollar and possibly exerting downward pressure on Bitcoin,” Bitfinex analysts said. While short-term volatility may persist, investor confidence for long-term growth is strong. Savvy investors believe this is the right time to find potential opportunities before Bitcoin hits the $115k target. Bitcoin Pepe New Meme Coin Crypto Presale !!! Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) As Bitcoin retests a crucial support level, investors are rushing to Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) to get a running start with the continuation of the bull leg. It is the first meme-focused ICO on BTC, aiming to create a state-of-the-art meme trading platform that combines Solana’s speed and low gas fees with Bitcoin’s security and trust. Bitcoin is bringing “Solana on Bitcoin” with its revolutionary PEP-20 standard that will mimic the growth ERC-20 brought to the Ethereum blockchain. PEP-20 will enable everyone to mint assets natively on Bitcoin instantly without needing permission. This will bring all meme coins to Bitcoin and unlock the network’s $2 trillion dormant capital for unmatched liquidity. The team just released some leaked UI images, giving us a sneak peek at what they’ve been building—the BTC bridge, the Bitcoin Pepe DEX, and their slick new Layer 2 block explorer. It looks like things are really heating up behind the scenes! In its ongoing presale, BPEP has shattered records by raising over $13.9m. Currently, the BPEP token is available at $0.0396. The presale window is narrowing, and investors have a limited time to scoop up BPEP at this price until the next listing update on June 17. BPEP will list on major tier-1 CEXs after the presale, which is expected to provide a boost and take it to the moon in the 2025 bull run. Cardano (ADA) Cardano’s price delivered some highly welcome gains to its investors as the ADA rose over 40% YTD. The rise in Cardano’s price started with the announcement of the Strategic Crypto Fund and was supported by technical improvements being carried out in the ADA network. As one of the top crypto platforms, ADA is well known for its green policies and strong PoS protocols. Despite being known for scalability and eco-friendliness, ADA has been under pressure due to emerging technical challenges with higher network usage. These problems have impacted Cardano’s price performance, which has remained under pressure over the last few weeks. The future growth of Cardano’s price will depend on how well the ADA community receives its ongoing technical improvements. Currently, ADA is trading at $0.64, with a market value of $22.65 billion. The trading volume has increased by 74% in the last 24 hours, showing growing trading activity in ADA and a probable chance of a reversal. Sui Blockchain (SUI) SUI is a Layer-1 blockchain that focuses on the gaming community and offers its strong object-oriented design capabilities to ensure developers can build high-performance dApps. SUI coin plays a big role in the world of the Sui blockchain. People mostly use it to pay transaction fees, stake their tokens, and have a say in how the network runs. But that’s not all — SUI also powers DeFi apps, games, and NFT projects. Thanks to its speed and scalability, it’s got the muscle to handle a lot without slowing down. Pretty handy, right? As the trend moves towards utility-rich projects with real-world usage, names like SUI could grow continuously. SUI has faced a decline of over 30% in the market correction, which could take time to recover. The current SUI price is $3.02, which is down by 12% over the weekly charts. Best cryptocurrencies to watch before next BTC rally With big money pouring into Bitcoin ETFs and weak economic data likely on the way, Bitcoin is set to hit $115K soon. If that happens, we might be looking at the start of a full-blown altcoin season, just around the corner. As the crypto market prepares for a fresh bull run, the highest gain potential remains with the low-priced Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) , with its low entry point of $0.0396. If you’re looking to position ahead of the next rally, this may be the best crypto to buy right now, followed by ADA and SUI.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/best-crypto-to-buy-now-as-bitcoin-eyes-115k-in-july-rally/,"ADA|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|SUI","Information",cryptocompare

2025-06-09T09:00:22,"Best crypto to buy now as BTC remains wobbly above $105K","The broader cryptocurrency market ticked slightly higher on Monday, but underlying weakness continues to weigh on sentiment. Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple’s XRP are all struggling to sustain weekend gains, with price action showing signs of vulnerability following Thursday’s sharp pullback. Investor focus has now shifted to the US-China trade talks slated for Monday in London, which are emerging as a key volatility trigger. Markets remain wary after the May 12 Geneva discussions led to a temporary truce on tariffs, which sparked a quick rebound in US equities and a delayed lift in Bitcoin. This time, participants appear more cautious, likely due to fading confidence in sustained diplomatic progress. Bitcoin is currently consolidating above the $105,000 mark, attempting to stabilise after Thursday’s abrupt decline. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $105,621 — still struggling to breach the $106,058 resistance, which marks the highest monthly close since December. Unless bulls convincingly reclaim this level, the risk of another downside correction remains elevated. With Bitcoin potentially facing renewed volatility, retail investors are pivoting toward potentially high-reward tokens such as Bitcoin Pepe , now nearing the end of its presale phase. Speculative capital is flowing into early-stage crypto projects, as traders seek to capitalise on momentum-driven plays that offer outsized return potential. Amid this rotation, Bitcoin Pepe has emerged as a favoured choice for market participants. The trade talks in London US President Donald Trump announced Friday that a senior American delegation will meet Chinese officials in London, marking a fresh attempt to salvage trade relations between the world’s two largest economies. Beijing later confirmed that Vice Premier He Lifeng will lead the Chinese side at the negotiations. The planned meeting follows a phone call between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping last week, which Trump characterised as a “very good talk.” The conversation was their first since the trade dispute escalated in February and reportedly focused on finding a path forward on economic cooperation. Washington will send Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to the talks. Last month, the two nations agreed to a temporary truce that included a mutual reduction of import tariffs. However, tensions resurfaced as both sides accused each other of failing to uphold parts of the agreement. The upcoming talks are seen as critical in averting a full-scale trade breakdown. The meeting between US Trade Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng comes at a sensitive moment, with many crypto traders opting to de-risk in advance. The rotation out of major tokens signals a broader expectation that even minor setbacks in the talks could provoke another wave of sell-offs. Why Bitcoin Pepe is seeing continued momentum in this volatility Despite near-term turbulence in Bitcoin’s price action, its recent climb to new highs has lifted sentiment across the crypto landscape, conditions that have historically paved the way for broader market upswings. Within this risk-on environment, investors are once again gravitating toward speculative assets, with meme coins emerging early as key beneficiaries. Bitcoin Pepe is one such project gaining momentum, drawing interest for its effort to fuse viral internet culture with a blockchain infrastructure narrative. Now regarded as one of the most closely watched presales of 2025, Bitcoin Pepe has carved out a distinct identity through its stated mission to “build Solana on Bitcoin,” seeking to marry Bitcoin’s security with the scalability associated with Solana. Differentiating itself from meme coins that lean solely on community buzz, Bitcoin Pepe is emphasising a development roadmap with tangible technical goals. The presale has already brought in over $14 million, ahead of a listing announcement on June 17. With capital flowing into early-stage ventures, Bitcoin Pepe appears well-positioned to harness ongoing momentum as it approaches the close of its presale.
