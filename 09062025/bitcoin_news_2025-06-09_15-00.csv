2025-06-09T12:52:06,"Tether mints $1b USDT on Tron: liquidity flood incoming?","Just months after its previous major mint event, Tether has once again minted a significant amount of tokens, likely in anticipation of increased demand. A recent move suggests Tether is preparing for a new wave of liquidity. On Monday, June 9, Tether minted $1 billion USDT on the Tron (TRX) blockchain, according to several blockchain analysts . This represents a sizable liquidity injection, even for the world’s largest stablecoin. Notably, the $1 billion mint accounts for more than 1% of all USDT supply on Tron, the blockchain that hosts the majority of USDT tokens. Currently, USDT supply on Tron stands at $76 billion, followed by Ethereum (ETH) with $63.2 billion. Tether’s total circulating supply is 156 billion. You might also like: Tether CEO denies reports as US probes and weighs sanctions Tether’s move is seen as a bullish signal by many traders. Historically, the stablecoin issuer mints USDT in anticipation of future demand for liquidity. While the freshly minted tokens have not yet entered circulation, their creation suggests that Tether expects rising demand and increased trading volume in the near term. This behavior has led to a recurring pattern: USDT issuance often coincides with bullish momentum across the crypto market. Tether’s last major mint occurred on May 21, when it issued 2 billion USDT on Tron. Just one day later, Bitcoin rose to its all-time high of $111,000.

Notably, analyst Jon Ma estimated that a Tether IPO would value the company at $515 billion. However, CEO Paolo Ardoino dismissed the idea, stating there is no need for the company to go public. Still, listing publicly would bring greater financial transparency—an area where Tether has faced longstanding criticism. Most recently, proposed U.S. stablecoin regulation has raised concerns that Tether could be pushed out of the market unless it adjusts its approach to disclosures.

2025-06-09T12:50:29,"Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will XRP Reach $5?","The post Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will XRP Reach $5? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights Live XRP Price: $ 2.26512146 . Predictions suggest XRP could reach $5.05 by the end of 2025. Long-term projections show XRP could hit $26.50 by 2030 and $526 by 2050. XRP, one of the top five crypto assets known for its role in cross-border payments, is drawing increased attention as institutional adoption grows and its long-standing legal battle nears a conclusion. Since President Trump took office, Ripple XRP has gained significant traction, fueled by rising on-chain activity, bullish market sentiment, and increasing speculation around a potential XRP ETF Approval in 2025. With these developments in play, XRP price prediction is becoming a major focus for investors. Can XRP reach $100? Is a $500 target realistic in the long term? This article dives deep into XRP price prediction for 2025 and beyond through 2030. Table of contents CoinPedia’s Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025 XRP Price Today XRP Crypto Price Prediction June 2025 XRP Price Prediction 2025 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 XRP Price Prediction 2026 Ripple Price Prediction 2027 XRP Price Prediction 2028 XRP Price Prediction 2029 XRP Price Prediction 2030 Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis Institutional XRP Price Targets for 2025 FAQs CoinPedia’s Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025 With regulatory clarity from the SEC case and Ripple accelerating its expansion, we at CoinPedia are optimistic about the XRP forecast. We expect the XRP coin price to reach $5.81 in 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 XRP Price Today Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 2.26512146 0.26% Market cap $ 133,238,187,445.32 Circulating Supply 58,821,652,442.00 Trading Volume $ 2,748,281,625.3967 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Crypto Price Prediction June 2025 XRP is currently in a pullback phase after testing the upper boundary of a multi-month descending wedge at $2.65 in mid-May. Since then, it has slipped below a key high-volume profile level. In early June, XRP is trying to hold above the previous swing low of $2.10 . Over the past few days, the price has seen a modest bounce to $2.25 , but it’s facing resistance due to a bearish crossover between the 20-day and 50-day EMA . If selling pressure continues and XRP breaks below the $2.10 support —which aligns closely with the 200-day EMA —the price could decline further toward $1.88 or even $1.63 .On the upside, if XRP breaks past the short-term EMA crossover and reclaims the key $2.40 resistance , it could trigger a rally toward $2.80 , with a chance to retest the all-time high of $3.40 later in June . However, momentum depends heavily on rising volume and increased volatility —both of which have been lacking during the recent bounce. Without these, XRP may stay in a consolidation phase or continue its downtrend. But if buying interest returns with higher volume and volatility, a sharp price surge could follow this month. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High June 2025 $1.7 $2.45 $3.40 XRP Price Prediction 2025 If XRP successfully breaks its all-time high of $3.40 in May 2025—a major supply zone on the chart—it could realistically target $5 by year-end, fueled by growing optimism from banks , institutions, and potential ETF support. Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD , is now integrated into its cross-border payments system, Ripple Payments, further strengthening its position in global finance. Notably, institutional dominance is evident, with the top 100 addresses holding 70% of the circulating supply, positioning XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $138 billion. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.05 $3.45 $5.05 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.50 6.25 8.50 2027 7.00 9.0 13.25 2028 11.25 13.75 16.00 2029 14.25 16.50 21.50 2030 17.00 19.75 26.50 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP cost will likely witness strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.50 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum price of XRP will be around $5.50, with an average trading price of $6.25. Ripple Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP coin price will range between $7.00 to $13.25. XRP price might record an average level of $9.00. XRP Price Prediction 2028 As per our XRP price prediction 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases. We expect the XRP future price to range between $11.25 to $16.00. The average trading price of Ripple could be around $13.75. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The price of XRP might record a trading range between $14.25 to $21.50, with an average price of $16.50. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The XRP prediction 2030 depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the Ripple coin price could scale between $17.00 to $26.50. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.75. Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Based on historic price sentiments and XRP’s rising popularity, here are the XRP future price projections for 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, and 2050. Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2031 25.00 29.50 35.25 2032 31.50 36.75 41.25 2033 35.75 42.25 47.75 2040 97.50 135.50 179.00 2050 219.25 331.50 526.00 Market Analysis Firm Name 2025 2026 2030 Changelly $2.05 $3.49 $17.76 Coincodex $2.38 $1.83 $1.66 Binance $2.16 $2.27 $2.76 Institutional XRP Price Targets for 2025 Name Target Standard Chartered $5.50 Sistine Research $33 to $50 Final Thoughts: Is XRP Still a Good Investment? Yes, XRP is still a good investment for those with a long-term view. With the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit nearing settlement, increasing institutional interest, and rising on-chain activity, XRP’s fundamentals remain strong. The integration of RLUSD and potential ETF listings further boosts its utility and market potential. While short-term volatility may persist, XRP price prediction models point to significant upside. If regulatory clarity continues, XRP could be well-positioned to reach ambitious targets like $100—or even higher—in the coming years. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-09T12:50:06,"Spot ETH ETFs See Astonishing $281M Inflows, Extending Winning Streak","BitcoinWorld Spot ETH ETFs See Astonishing $281M Inflows, Extending Winning Streak Get ready for some exciting news from the world of crypto finance! The U.S. Spot ETH ETFs are continuing their impressive run, pulling in hundreds of millions in fresh capital. This isn’t just a one-off event; it signals growing confidence and momentum in the market. Understanding the Significance of Ethereum ETF Inflows When we talk about Ethereum ETF inflows , we’re referring to the net amount of money flowing into these regulated investment products designed to track the price of Ethereum. Think of an ETF like a basket of assets you can buy and sell on traditional stock exchanges. A spot ETH ETF specifically holds actual Ethereum as its underlying asset. Why are these inflows so significant? Institutional Interest: Large inflows often indicate that big players – like asset managers, hedge funds, and institutional investors – are putting money into these products. This is crucial for mainstream adoption. Market Validation: Consistent inflows provide validation for Ethereum as an investable asset class within traditional financial frameworks. Accessibility: ETFs make it easier for everyday investors to get exposure to Ethereum without directly buying and storing the cryptocurrency themselves. The recent data paints a clear picture: investors are increasingly comfortable accessing Ethereum through regulated ETF structures. Recent Performance: Spot ETH ETFs Maintain Momentum According to data tracked by SoSoValue, U.S. Spot ETH ETFs collectively saw a net inflow of a substantial $281 million last week. This follows a pattern of positive activity that has now extended for four consecutive weeks. Let’s break down the key numbers: Weekly Net Inflow: $281 million Consecutive Positive Weeks: Four Total Assets Under Management (AUM): Approximately $9.4 billion This consistent positive flow is a strong indicator of sustained demand and positive sentiment surrounding Ethereum and its regulated investment vehicles. Which Funds Are Leading the Way? While multiple issuers offer Spot ETH ETFs, one fund stood out last week: BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust, trading under the ticker BlackRock ETHA . This fund accounted for a significant portion of the total inflows. Last week, BlackRock ETHA recorded approximately $249 million in net inflows. This dominant performance highlights the influence and reach of major asset managers in attracting investor capital to the crypto space via ETFs. How Do These Inflows Compare to the Broader Crypto ETF Market? The performance of the Crypto ETF Market has been closely watched, especially since the launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. While Bitcoin ETFs initially saw massive inflows followed by periods of outflows, the recent trend for Ethereum ETFs has been steadily positive since their launch. Comparing the two: Bitcoin ETFs paved the way, establishing the framework for spot crypto products in the U.S. The success and investor familiarity with Bitcoin ETFs likely contributed to a smoother reception for Spot ETH ETFs. The consistent inflows into Ethereum products suggest that investors are now broadening their crypto exposure beyond just Bitcoin through these regulated avenues. What Do These ETH ETF Inflows Signal for the Future? The sustained ETH ETF inflows carry several potential implications for the market: Increased Liquidity: More capital flowing into the ETFs can increase their trading volume and liquidity, making them more attractive to larger investors. Potential Price Impact: While not a direct one-to-one correlation, consistent buying pressure from large funds managing these ETFs can contribute to upward price momentum for Ethereum itself. Validation of Ethereum’s Ecosystem: The interest in ETH ETFs underscores the growing recognition of Ethereum’s role as the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and numerous other blockchain applications. Regulatory Comfort: The approval and successful launch of these products signal increasing regulatory comfort, which could pave the way for other crypto-related investment products in the future. However, it’s important to remember that the crypto market remains volatile. While inflows are positive, prices can still fluctuate based on broader market sentiment, regulatory news, and macroeconomic factors. Challenges and Considerations Despite the positive inflow trend, the Crypto ETF Market , including ETH ETFs, still faces challenges: Market Volatility: Ethereum’s price is subject to significant swings, which directly impacts the value of the ETFs. Regulatory Landscape: While approved, the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies and related products continues to evolve globally. Investor Education: Ensuring investors understand the specific risks associated with crypto assets, even within an ETF wrapper, is crucial. These factors mean that while the trend is encouraging, investors should approach ETH ETFs with a clear understanding of the associated risks. Actionable Insights for Investors For those watching the Spot ETH ETFs space, here are some takeaways: Monitor Inflow Trends: Consistent inflows suggest positive sentiment and potential buying pressure. Observe BlackRock ETHA’s Performance: As a leading fund, its activity can be a bellwether for broader institutional interest. Understand the Product: Know how ETH ETFs work and compare different offerings in terms of fees and structure. Consider Your Risk Tolerance: Investing in crypto-linked products means accepting a higher level of risk compared to traditional assets. The current trend indicates robust demand, but informed decision-making is always key. Conclusion: A Bullish Signal for Ethereum and the Crypto ETF Market The sustained $281 million net inflow into U.S. Spot ETH ETFs last week, marking the fourth consecutive week of gains, is a powerful signal. Led by significant contributions like those seen in BlackRock ETHA , these inflows underscore growing institutional and retail interest in accessing Ethereum through regulated, traditional finance products. The expanding AUM of nearly $9.4 billion further solidifies the presence of Ethereum within the mainstream investment landscape. This positive momentum for Ethereum ETF Inflows is not just good news for the individual funds but also reflects increasing confidence in the broader Crypto ETF Market and the underlying Ethereum network itself. While challenges remain, the current trajectory points towards continued integration of crypto assets into global financial portfolios.

2025-06-09T12:46:50,"Ethereum No Longer Just Hype, Moving to Real-World Use, Says Bernstein Analyst","The post Ethereum No Longer Just Hype, Moving to Real-World Use, Says Bernstein Analyst appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, seems to be at a turning point. While Bitcoin still grabs most of the headlines, some experts believe that Ethereum is quietly stepping into the spotlight. Analysts at Bernstein believe Ethereum is no longer just a playground for speculation but is starting to show real-world value as financial activity on blockchain networks grows. Bitcoin Remains Strong, But Ethereum’s Role Expands For years, Bitcoin has been the poster child of digital money, and it’s not slowing down. In fact, analysts at Bernstein expect it to reach a whopping $200,000 this cycle, a figure they still call conservative. But analysts say there’s more to watch in crypto now, with Ethereum playing a bigger role. Unlike Bitcoin, which is mostly seen as a digital store of value, Ethereum acts as a “decentralized computer,” hosting stablecoins and tokenized assets. It’s already the main blockchain for stablecoin transactions and new financial experiments, which could be a sign of things to come. Ethereum ETFs Gaining Investor Attention So far, Ethereum’s U.S. spot ETFs haven’t gotten the same attention as Bitcoin’s. Since launching in July, they’ve gathered about $9 billion, compared to Bitcoin ETFs’ $120 billion. However, in the past three weeks alone, ETH ETFs have seen $815 million in new money, suggesting that interest is picking up. The growing flow of investment is seen as a signal that more investors are taking Ethereum seriously. Analysts believe this could be the early stage of a major shift for the crypto market. Real Companies Turn to Ethereum Meanwhile, Bernstein points out that major payment giants like Visa and Mastercard are already working on projects that use stablecoins running on Ethereum’s blockchain. Even big names in crypto, like Coinbase and Robinhood, are building services on Ethereum rather than just offering trading. The analysts argue that if companies and financial institutions are using blockchain technology, Ethereum, as the main network powering these activities, should benefit in the long run. Hype to Real Financial Tools Experts say this moment marks a change in how people see crypto. Ethereum is no longer just for speculation. It’s becoming part of how payments, investing, and financial products might work in the future.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ethereum-no-longer-just-hype-moving-to-real-world-use-says-bernstein-analyst/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE","News",cryptocompare

The MATIC price could reach a maximum of $0.47181 in 2025. POL price with a potential surge may reach a high of $4.94731 by 2030. Polygon (POL) has a mind-blowing Layer-2 scaling solution project for Ethereum, which is primarily designed to address slow speeds and the network’s high transaction fees. As a result, Polygon is seen as a revolutionary framework for developers and users, as it attracts by offering a more efficient Ethereum experience, which is the reason contributing to POL’s price value, too. Through, POL, which is its native token (formerly MATIC), is utilized for transaction fees and network governance, in the framwork of interconnected Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. Its use case makes it an attractive altcoin, and even its token POL price is attracting attention. The coin is expected to show a surge in the coming sessions, but it would require a technical eye to understand. Therefore, if you are curious about whether the POL price can rebound to $1. Will Polygon go up? And is Polygon a good investment? We bring our Polygon Price Prediction for 2025 – 2030 to explore the POL price prediction. Table of contents Overview Polygon Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Polygon Price Action 2026 POL Price Prediction 2027 Polygon Crypto Price Forecast 2028 MATIC Coin Price Projection 2029 Polygon Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Polygon Token MATIC Price $ 0.21819891 2.88% Market Cap $ 0.00 Trading Volume $ 1,217,344.7306 Circulating Supply 0.00 All-time High $1.29 Mar 14, 2024 All-time Low $0.1533 Apr 07, 2025 Polygon Price Prediction 2025 As evident on the POL/USD daily chart on COINBASE, its price fell in Q1 2025, along with other altcoins in the market, due to trade deal problems in the US. This led investors to refrain from investing in the entire market and watch from the sidelines. However, in Q2 2025’s April month onwards, momentum started as investors got a glimpse of improving geopolitical situations and other positive factors. However, like every other altcoin, POL price action didn’t have a big rise in early May, and it lost its strength early on after reaching $0.269. Even the RSI has slipped below the median line and has taken rejection from the 14-day SMA smoothing line. Despite the loss in momentum, the bears have not been dominant yet, and it is consolidating near the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands and key support zone. But if it breaks the support zone’s low of $0.194, then bearish forces will take control and push it down to the $0.15 level. However, if the conditions improve, then the 0.5 Fibonacci level at $0.4572 could act as a magnet for the POL price to rise. This level also aligns with early 2025’s price action-based high-volume profile level. If it successfully clears the $0.4572 level in June, there is a higher chance that the POL price might hit the Fibonacci 0.786 level at $0.6336 and the other at $0.7655 by the end of the year 2025. On the contrary, if the $0.4572 proves to be too strong to break, then there is a strong chance for bears to take over the trend and repel the price from the fibonacci 0.5 level to the lows of 2025.

2025-06-09T12:43:03,"Dogecoin and Pepe Millionaire Keeps Buying Crypto – Best Meme Coins to 100x in 2025","Glauber Contessoto, famously known as the ‘Dogecoin Millionaire’ (for obvious reasons ) has shifted his interest to $PEPE. He has also injected $10K into $WIF, $BRETT, and $FLOKI, highlighting his belief that investing in the best meme coins can unlock substantial wealth. Will he continue his millionaire trend, or will his journey meet an abrupt end? Let’s discuss how his latest moves put some of the best altcoin investment opportunities into perspective. Dogecoin Millionaire Puts Hundreds of Thousands Into $PEPE In February 2025, Contessoto sold his entire Ethereum portfolio and dumped everything into $PEPE. [It was] hundreds of thousands of dollars,’ he laughed. ‘I was like, you know what? Fuck it. I sold out all of my $ETH, completely sold everything, and put it all into Pepe — Contessoto, Binance The decision paid off in the end. $PEPE spiked by 36.96% at the end of February, causing his position to be valued at ~$1.116M across six verified wallets. Despite $DOGE dumping by ~19% compared to last month, he claims to still hold around $920K worth of Dogecoin (~$27B). Considering he never sold up his $DOGE, you might ponder, ‘Where’s the capital for his crypto investments coming from?’ When he shot to crypto fame in 2021, he earned $10K/month through YouTube videos and voiceovers for HipHopDX . And that’s what funded his $PEPE, $WIF, $BRETT, and $FLOKI investments. Contessoto’s journey shows that meme coins can deliver life-changing gains. But timing is everything. That’s why coins like $WIF, $SNORT , and $HYPER could be the best crypto to buy now . 1. Dogwifhat ($WIF) – Shiba Inu-Themed Coin That’s Surged 5% This Week Having nearly jumped by 5% over the past week , Dogwifhat ($WIF) might be one of the best buys right now, as its price possibly climbs even higher in the coming days. $WIF’s central theme revolves around a Shiba Inu dog wearing a cute pink knitted hat – an image that has since become a viral meme. One of its benefits is its Solana foundation, which means fast transactions ( up to 65K per second ) and low fees ( ~$0.0005 ), making it accessible for frequent trading and broader adoption. Moreover, it boasts a community-driven governance model. Following an initial incident in which the project faced rug pull accusations, the community successfully took back control. Its decentralized model significantly contributes to its appeal for transparency-loving traders. As a fast, community-owned token, $WIF stands out as a serious contender in the meme coin space. You can buy $WIF for around $0.91 on some of the best crypto exchanges , including MEXC , Bybit , and Binance . 2. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Trading Bot Designed to Outpace Its Competitors With 0.85% Trading Fees Snorter Token ($SNORT) powers Snorter Bot, a high-speed training assistant that will run directly on Telegram by Q3 2025. Designed for degens who live for the next meme coin moonshot, the bot will soon help you to identify, track, and trade the best new cryptocurrency projects . Featuring a playful aardvark mascot, the project will ‘snort’ through Solana’s data to deliver real-time insights and automated trading tools: sniping, stop-losses, copy-trading, and instant swaps. Additionally, it’ll offer low trading fees of just 0.85%, compared to the standard 1.5%. Already, it boasts about being more cost-effective than other crypto trading bots, such as Maestro, Trojan, Banana Gun, Bonk Bot, and SOL Trading Bot. The bot will also feature MEV protection , plus honeypot and rug pull detection, helping you steer clear of scam tokens. In 2024, American citizens alone lost a staggering $9.32B to crypto scams , making security-focused tools like Snorter Bot increasingly important. Demonstrating the project’s success, Snorter Token has raised $145K within hours of going on presale, and $628K ever since. You can buy $SNORT for just $0.0949, the lowest you’ll ever get it before the next price increase. You can stake your tokens at an appealing 504% APY, which offers passive income potential ahead of broader adoption. 3. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Bitcoin Layer 2 Powered By Solana Virtual Machine, Launching Q3 2025 Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the backbone of an upcoming Bitcoin Layer 2 (L2) network, scheduled to go live in Q3 2025. By integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and a canonical bridge , it aims to facilitate seamless and secure Bitcoin L1-L2 transfers. Moreover, through SVM-integrated smart contracts (for ultra-fast, scalable dApps), it will address some of Bitcoin’s biggest challenges, including slow transaction speeds, high fees, and a lack of programmability. Another standout feature is the settlement of all transactions on the Bitcoin L1. This will provide unmatched security and a permanent audit trail without slow and unnecessary cryptographic proofs. You can get early access to the Bitcoin L2 by purchasing $HYPER on presale, currently for just $0.011825. Driven by major CEX listings, it could reach $0.32 by the end of the year, so now’s a great time to join the presale for potential gains of ~2,607%. $HYPER can also be staked at a hefty 914% APY. This percentage will likely decrease as more users join the staking pool, so there’s no better time to lock in $HYPER than now. $WIF, $SNORT & $HYPER Might 100x in the Next Bull Run Contessoto’s journey from being a Dogecoin millionaire to a multi-meme coin investor highlights a key lesson: in crypto, timing and narrative are crucial decision factors. With $WIF up 5% at a favorable price and $SNORT and $HYPER available on presale at their lowest current prices, you might not find better investment opportunities this year. If you’re looking to 100x in the next crypto cycle, these coins might be your best bet in the coming rally. Of course, you must always do your research and never invest more than you can afford to lose.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/best-meme-coins-to-100x-in-2025/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News",cryptocompare
2025-06-09T12:42:32,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Smart Money Is Watching These Two Levels – Are You?","Bitcoin (BTC) has snapped its two-week losing streak, rebounding from a low of $100,200 to trade above $107,600. This upward shift follows BTC’s decisive break through a multi-week descending trendline on the 4-hour chart, a move that technical traders view as a short-term momentum reversal. What triggered the move? A bullish engulfing candle pierced through $106,800, a key resistance level now acting as short-term support. Additionally, BTC is posting higher lows, forming a textbook bullish pattern. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 66.76, suggesting the current rally is gaining strength but is approaching overbought territory. The next critical resistance is $108,905. If that breaks, Bitcoin price prediction could target $110,565 and even $111,987 in a bullish continuation. Smart Money Eyes $103,700 and $95,600 Beyond the technicals, on-chain metrics are painting a clear picture of where smart money is watching. According to Glassnode ‘s Spendable Supply Distribution (SSD), 95% of all circulating BTC was purchased at a price below $103,700. That level now acts as a psychological and statistical floor, which analysts often refer to as “cost-basis support.” Bitcoin Quantiles Cost Basis. Source: Glassnode Another critical level lies at $95,600, where 85% of the Bitcoin supply has a lower acquisition price. These quantile thresholds create “value zones” where institutional and long-term investors are likely to step in and defend the price. If Bitcoin pulls back from current levels, expect these two price areas to serve as buffers before any deeper correction. Key Support Zones: $103,700: 95% SSD threshold $95,600: 85% SSD cost basis $106,800: Trendline retest zone Bitcoin Outlook: Bullish Setup with Short-Term Caution Despite increased pressure from long-term holders (LTHs) taking profits, historical data signals that June is usually favorable for Bitcoin. The median monthly return stands at +2.58%, signaling that the current rebound may still have legs. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Traders should, however, approach the current setup with discipline. The breakout just above $106,800 is promising; however, a failed break over $108,905 could lead to a solid retracement. The relative strength index (RSI) levels signal a cooldown that might be needed before bulls can clear the next hurdle. Trade Idea: Entry: Wait for a confirmed 4-hour close above $108,905 Stop-loss: Place below $106,800 Target 1: $110,565 Target 2: $111,987 Note: Avoid entering prematurely; RSI is approaching overbought In short, smart money is tracking both the $103,700 and $95,600 zones for value, while the breakout structure signals a bullish bias, provided BTC holds its ground Bitcoin Hyper Presale Hits $821K—Layer 2 Just Got a Meme-Sized Upgrade Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is taking off as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2, combining speed, scalability, and meme culture. Built to fix Bitcoin’s most significant flaws—slow transactions and high fees—it leverages the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to bring fast, low-cost smart contracts to the BTC ecosystem. With over $821,823 already raised, early adopters are betting big on its blend of tech innovation and meme appeal. Core Features That Set It Apart What makes Bitcoin Hyper different? It’s the only Bitcoin-based Layer 2 that combines the speed of SVM with the security of BTC’s base layer. The Canonical Bridge allows seamless BTC transfers, while low-cost gas fees and high-speed execution empower dApps, meme coins, payments, and more. Audited by Consult, it’s built for speed, trust, and scale. Staking Rewards and Utility $HYPER isn’t just a token; it powers the ecosystem. Users can stake it for high APY rewards post-launch, use it for gas fees, and access premium decentralized applications (dApps). Plus, active holders can earn bonuses via governance and early adoption initiatives. That’s real utility in a meme-capable package. Presale Now Live—Don’t Miss the Price Jump The public presale is now live, with 1 $HYPER priced at $0.011825. Over 90% of the funding goal has already been raised.

2025-06-09T12:40:11,"US spot Bitcoin ETFs Face Shocking Net Outflows Totaling $128.81M Last Week","BitcoinWorld US spot Bitcoin ETFs Face Shocking Net Outflows Totaling $128.81M Last Week Hey crypto enthusiasts and investors! Let’s dive into the latest buzz from the world of institutional Bitcoin adoption. While the launch of US spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year was met with immense excitement and saw billions pour in, the flow isn’t always one-way. Recent data reveals a notable shift, with these investment vehicles experiencing net outflows. Understanding the Recent Bitcoin ETF Outflows According to fresh data compiled by SoSoValue, the cohort of US spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively recorded a net outflow of $128.81 million over the past week. This figure represents the total amount of money leaving these funds exceeding the amount entering them during that period. It’s a key metric that investors and market watchers use to gauge sentiment and demand for Bitcoin exposure via these regulated products. While the overall number shows money exiting the category, the picture is more nuanced when you look at individual funds. Not all ETFs experienced the same fate: BlackRock’s IBIT: Standing out against the trend, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) actually saw positive flows. It attracted a net inflow of $81 million last week, indicating continued demand for this specific product. Fidelity’s FBTC: On the other side of the spectrum, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) faced the largest net outflow, with $168 million exiting the fund. Other ETFs: Other smaller US spot Bitcoin ETFs also contributed to the net outflow figure, though IBIT and FBTC represent the most significant movements in either direction. Why Are We Seeing These Flows? Understanding the drivers behind Bitcoin ETF outflows is crucial. Several factors can influence whether investors are buying or selling shares in these funds: Market Volatility and Price Action: Bitcoin’s price movements significantly impact investor sentiment. Periods of price consolidation or downturns can lead some investors to take profits or reduce exposure, resulting in outflows. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic indicators, interest rate expectations, and global market sentiment can influence appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. Profit-Taking: Many early investors in these ETFs, or those who converted from GBTC (which saw significant outflows upon conversion), might be cashing out after significant gains since the ETFs launched. Competition and Fund-Specific Dynamics: While less likely to cause net category outflows, competition among ETFs or specific news related to a fund manager could influence flows between different products like IBIT and FBTC. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin AUM ? Despite the recent net outflows, the total assets under management (AUM) held within US spot Bitcoin ETFs remains substantial. As of June 6th, these funds collectively managed an impressive $125.58 billion in assets. This figure highlights the significant amount of institutional and retail capital that has flowed into the Bitcoin ecosystem through these regulated investment vehicles since their inception. While a week of outflows is worth noting, it’s important to view it in the context of the overall picture. The rapid accumulation of over $125 billion in Bitcoin AUM in just a few months demonstrates the strong underlying demand and the success of these products in providing accessible Bitcoin exposure. IBIT vs. FBTC : A Closer Look The contrasting performance of IBIT and FBTC last week is particularly interesting. BlackRock’s continued ability to attract inflows, even as others face redemptions, could be attributed to various factors, including their vast distribution network, brand recognition, and potentially lower fees or specific fund structures that appeal to certain investor segments. Conversely, FBTC experiencing the largest outflow could be due to a variety of reasons, including specific investor bases within Fidelity taking profits or rebalancing portfolios. Here’s a quick look at the key numbers from last week: ETF Issuer Net Flow Last Week Overall US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Various -$128.81 million IBIT BlackRock +$81 million FBTC Fidelity -$168 million Data Source: SoSoValue (as referenced) Actionable Insights for Investors So, what should you take away from this news? Here are a few actionable insights: Monitor Flows: Keep an eye on weekly and daily flow data for US spot Bitcoin ETFs . While one week isn’t a trend, sustained outflows could signal shifting sentiment. Look Beyond the Headline: Understand which specific ETFs are seeing flows. The performance of IBIT and FBTC can offer clues about different investor segments. Context is Key: Evaluate ETF flows alongside other market indicators like price action, on-chain data, and macroeconomic news. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that ETFs provide a long-term investment vehicle. Short-term fluctuations in flows are normal market behavior. The significant Bitcoin AUM still reflects strong long-term interest. Concluding Thoughts The past week saw US spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively experience net outflows, a notable shift after months of significant inflows. While the $128.81 million figure represents a relatively small percentage of the total $125.58 billion in Bitcoin AUM , it serves as a reminder that market dynamics are constantly evolving. The contrasting flows between funds like IBIT (inflows) and FBTC (outflows) highlight the diverse strategies and investor bases within the ETF ecosystem. Monitoring these flows provides valuable insights into institutional and retail interest in Bitcoin, but it’s essential to consider the broader market context and maintain a long-term perspective on Bitcoin’s adoption journey.

While the primary cryptocurrency has long stood (and perhaps, continues to) as a passive store of value, newer frameworks like restaking protocols are emerging to unlock its tremendous economic potential without altering its base-layer integrity. In this exciting interview with Luke Xie, the co-founder and CEO of SatLayer, we explore how the concept of Bitcoin restaking could reshape its utility across DeFi. From programmable slashing logic to multi-chain security coordination, however, restaking presents both technical hurdles and considerable opportunities. So stay tuned and let’s dive right into it. What role do you think the Bitcoin Reserve in the US will play in decentralized finance? The U.S. Bitcoin Reserve symbolizes mainstream validation of Bitcoin’s long-term value. While it may not directly participate in DeFi, its existence underpins trust in Bitcoin as a pristine, censorship-resistant collateral asset. This trust creates a stronger foundation for decentralized finance built on Bitcoin. The more confidence institutions and sovereign entities have in BTC, the more likely DeFi protocols are to adopt it as a core asset — unlocking composability, liquidity, and programmability that respects Bitcoin’s ethos. What are the biggest technical challenges in bringing restaking to Bitcoin? Xie summarized the challenges into three main groups. Slashing programmability across diverse BVSs Unlike traditional staking, which is typically binary (you either sign correctly or not), restaking introduces service-specific enforcement. Each BVS — whether it’s an oracle, bridge, DEX, or rollup — has its own definition of misbehavior. The challenge lies in designing slashing logic that is not only programmable and verifiable, but also flexible enough to adapt to the needs of each individual service. Secure multi-BVS coordination Operators often secure multiple BVSs at the same time, each with its own rules and risk parameters. Ensuring that slashing and reward logic is correctly isolated or cross-enforced — without compromising security or fairness — is a critical part of restaking infrastructure design. Vault design and isolation guarantees Restakers deposit BTC LSTs into vaults that connect to one or more BVSs. Each vault inherits that service’s specific slashing conditions and risk exposure. The challenge is ensuring restakers have full visibility into what risks they’re opting into, with clearly encoded slashing logic, predictable withdrawal flows, and transparent grace period mechanics. What advantages does Bitcoin restaking offer compared to traditional staking in proof-of-stake ecosystems? Bitcoin’s market cap is at $2.1T (as of May 23, 2025) and yet over 90% of Bitcoin sits idle — stored but unused, with its economic potential untapped. Restaking changes that. It transforms BTC from passive capital into productive, yield-generating collateral, unlocking powerful economic utility without altering Bitcoin’s base layer. Bitcoin restaking pairs BTC’s unmatched economic credibility with a fee-based, utility-driven yield model. Unlike traditional proof-of-stake systems that rely on inflationary emissions and dilute token holders, Bitcoin restaking is built on real services and real demand. Restaked BTC is used to secure Bitcoin Validated Services (BVSs) — decentralized use-cases like on-chain insurance coverage and liquidity float provisioning — that generate protocol-level fees from day one. This means restakers earn sustainable, non-inflationary yield based on the actual economic value they contribute, not just for locking up capital. With SatLayer, restaked BTC doesn’t just secure a single chain — it can support a modular, multi-chain ecosystem, from rollups and bridges to oracles and appchains. Restakers gain exposure to multiple sources of real yield without being tied to any one protocol’s inflation schedule. What does a “productive BTC” world look like in the next 2–3 years, and what needs to happen to get there? A “productive BTC” world is one where Bitcoin is no longer just a passive store of value — it’s actively securing decentralized systems, earning real yield, and serving as pristine collateral across DeFi and real-world applications. In this future, BTC is restaked to secure critical infrastructure like oracles, rollups, bridges, and appchains. The rewards aren’t driven by inflation or speculative tokenomics, but by delivering tangible, economically valuable security to networks that need it. The yield is real — paid by users and applications that derive genuine utility and trust from Bitcoin’s economic weight. At the center of this transformation is SatLayer — the protocol that connects BTC holders, emerging protocols, and real economic activity. To make this future a reality, SatLayer is, from day one, onboarding Bitcoin Validated Services (BVSs) — revenue generating decentralized services that rely on Bitcoin-backed restaking to function securely — in order to generate sustainable, real, protocol-level fees. This design promotes a crucial mindset shift: BTC holders are no longer just “hodling” — they’re empowered to put their assets to work and earn sustainable, ecosystem-driven yield. As this takes hold, it sets off a self-sustaining, incentives-aligned flywheel: BTC enters productive restaking via SatLayer. Protocols gain Bitcoin-backed security, boosting their credibility and resilience. Restakers earn real sustainable yield, increasing Bitcoin’s utility and appeal. That yield attracts more BTC into the system, amplifying its security guarantees. More projects choose to build on Bitcoin-backed security, unlocking even more yield opportunities. With SatLayer as the foundation, BTC evolves from digital gold into the economic engine of a secure, decentralized future. How is SatLayer approaching security and slashing risks in a modular, multi-chain restaking model? Built with a security-first mindset, SatLayer’s core infrastructure undergoes quarterly third-party audits by leading security firms, along with continuous testing and formal verification of critical components. But SatLayer’s real innovation lies in how it handles risk: through programmable, application-specific slashing. Unlike traditional staking models with one-size-fits-all penalties, SatLayer enables each Bitcoin Validated Service (BVS) to define its own slashing logic — customized to its specific use case, security requirements, and threat model. Example : In the context of an on-chain coverage BVS, Bitcoin restakers provide security guarantees for underwriting smart contract risk or protocol failures. In the event that an insured protocol fails — due to a hack, smart contract bug, liquidation shortfall, or depeg — programmable logic can trigger a slash and initiate payouts. Essentially, BVSs act as decentralized claims adjudicators — ingesting on-chain events, oracle data, and even off-chain proofs to verify claims and execute coverage. This modular, opt-in security model ensures that Bitcoin restakers are only ever exposed to risks they explicitly accept, with full visibility into each BVS’s slashing logic and parameters before delegating capital. By combining audit-grade infrastructure with programmable risk management, SatLayer brings Bitcoin-grade assurance to a dynamic, restaking environment — all while preserving sovereignty and minimizing unintended exposure. How can Bitcoin’s credibility and SatLayer’s infrastructure help rebuild trust in decentralized finance? The 2022–2023 wave of DeFi failures exposed the dangers of over-financialization and opaque, mispriced risk. Bitcoin offers a counterweight — with monetary clarity, fixed supply, and a neutral, non-inflationary baseline. And SatLayer extends that clarity into DeFi. By enabling BTC to secure protocols through restaking — in a transparent, opt-in way — it replaces governance-heavy systems with code-enforced trust. When decentralized services are underpinned by Bitcoin’s credibility and SatLayer’s modular, verifiable economic layer, they gain stronger guarantees, are fundamentally more resilient — and become more aligned with the original values of decentralization: trustless execution, transparent logic, user sovereignty, and censorship resistance. What’s a major misconception the crypto community has about Bitcoin’s potential role in DeFi? A major misconception in the crypto community is that Bitcoin can’t play an active role in DeFi — that it’s only useful as a passive store of value, not as programmable collateral. This belief stems from Bitcoin’s deliberately minimal scripting model and the absence of native smart contracts. As a result, many assume that BTC must be wrapped, bridged, or fundamentally compromised to participate in decentralized applications. But that’s changing. Protocols like SatLayer challenge this assumption head on — introducing restaking and slashing mechanisms that extend Bitcoin’s utility without sacrificing its core principles. Through opt-in vaults, verifiable operator behavior, and programmable economic enforcement, Bitcoin can now provide r eal, cryptoeconomic security to services like oracles, insurance, bridges, and liquidity layers — without being bridged or reissued. The real misconception is underestimating how far credibility, transparency, and programmable enforcement can go when composed with intention. With a modular framework like SatLayer, Bitcoin transforms from passive digital gold into an active foundation for a new financial economy — one that’s secure, programmable, and trustless by design.

2025-06-09T12:28:26,"Crypto Tax in India Is Crushing Profits, Here’s How Bitcoin ETFs Can Save You","The post Crypto Tax in India Is Crushing Profits, Here’s How Bitcoin ETFs Can Save You appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News India’s crypto investment scene is under pressure. Despite ₹1 crore in current Bitcoin trading volume, the Indian tax regime is stifling growth with its harsh tax policies. Investors once enjoyed a massive 123% gain on Bitcoin holdings in recent years — but now, they’re calling the current tax system “daylight robbery.” The Harsh Reality of India’s Crypto Tax Under India’s current tax regime, crypto profits are taxed at a flat 30% , plus a 4% surcharge . To make matters worse, every crypto trade — regardless of profit or loss — is subject to a 1% TDS (Tax Deducted at Source). But that’s not all: No set-off : Crypto losses can’t be set off against any other income. No carry-forward : Losses also can’t be carried forward to future tax years. No holding distinction : Whether you hold Bitcoin long-term or trade short-term, the tax rate stays the same. This leaves Indian crypto investors with no room for tax planning and no protection for losses , making the landscape extremely restrictive. The Tax-Saving Loophole: Bitcoin ETFs Amid this tough environment, Bitcoin ETFs are emerging as a smart alternative for Indian investors looking to save on taxes. Here’s why Bitcoin ETFs are treated more favorably : Not classified as VDAs : Bitcoin ETFs are considered foreign mutual fund units , not Virtual Digital Assets. Lower tax rate : If held for more than 24 months, they are taxed at just 12.5% as long-term capital gains , compared to the 30% flat on direct crypto. No TDS : Bitcoin ETFs are not subject to the 1% TDS rule. Set-off & carry forward : Losses can be set off against other capital gains and carried forward into future years. According to some HNIs (High-Net-Worth Individuals), Bitcoin ETF structures can save up to 60% in taxes compared to direct Bitcoin investments. But Is Bitcoin Still Safe? Counterparty Risks Explained While ETFs provide a structured route, direct Bitcoin investments still come with regulatory and security concerns : Bitcoin remains unregulated by SEBI, and investor protection is minimal. Platforms like Vauld and WazirX have been in the spotlight for lack of local investor protection . WazirX even stated recently that ₹5,000 crore worth of investor funds were “company-owned,” raising serious red flags. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Europe’s First Bitcoin Treasury Firm Plans $340M BTC Buy , What’s Next for Indian Crypto Investors?

2025-06-09T12:20:45,"Bitcoin: Jump Crypto Executes Massive $105M Transfer to Galaxy Digital","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Jump Crypto Executes Massive $105M Transfer to Galaxy Digital The world of institutional cryptocurrency is constantly buzzing with activity, and large transfers between major players often signal underlying strategies or market positioning. A recent notable event caught the eye of market observers: a significant Bitcoin transfer involving two prominent firms, Jump Crypto and Galaxy Digital. Understanding the Jump Crypto and Galaxy Digital Transfer According to on-chain data shared by The Data Nerd on X, Jump Crypto , the digital asset arm of the renowned trading firm Jump Trading Group, recently transferred a substantial amount of Bitcoin to Galaxy Digital , the financial services and investment management firm founded by Mike Novogratz. Let’s break down the details: Approximately two hours prior to the report, 501 BTC were moved from a wallet associated with Jump Crypto to one linked to Galaxy Digital. At the time of the transfer, this 501 BTC was valued at roughly $53 million. This wasn’t an isolated event. Over the three days leading up to the report, Galaxy Digital had accumulated a total of 1,001 BTC from Jump Crypto. The cumulative value of these transfers over the three days amounted to approximately $105.32 million. This series of transactions highlights the active relationship and potential operational needs between these major institutional entities within the crypto ecosystem. Why Are These Institutional Bitcoin Transfers Significant? When large players like Jump Crypto and Galaxy Digital move substantial amounts of cryptocurrency, it’s rarely arbitrary. These movements can offer insights into their strategies, market outlook, or operational requirements. Tracking such on-chain activity is a key part of understanding the institutional landscape in crypto. Potential reasons behind large institutional Bitcoin transfer events include: Over-the-Counter (OTC) Trading: Firms often conduct large trades off public exchanges to minimize market impact. One party might transfer assets to another as part of a pre-arranged OTC deal. Custody Solutions: Galaxy Digital offers custody services. Jump Crypto might be moving assets into Galaxy’s custody for secure storage or management. Liquidity Management: Assets might be moved between wallets or entities for various liquidity needs, such as preparing for trading activities, meeting client demands, or rebalancing portfolios. Strategic Positioning: Accumulation or distribution of assets could signal a firm’s bullish or bearish stance, although a single transfer doesn’t provide the full picture. Internal Transfers: While less likely between two distinct major firms unless part of a partnership or service agreement, sometimes large movements are simply internal restructuring. Without direct confirmation from the firms, the exact reason for this specific Jump Crypto to Galaxy Digital transfer remains speculative, but the volume indicates a purposeful action. Galaxy Digital’s Growing Bitcoin Holdings: A Closer Look The report also shed light on Galaxy Digital’s current Institutional Bitcoin holdings. Following the accumulation of 1,001 BTC from Jump Crypto over three days, Galaxy Digital’s reported wallet now holds a total of 4,377 BTC. At the time of the report, this impressive holding was valued at approximately $462.37 million. This substantial holding underscores Galaxy Digital’s significant presence in the Bitcoin market. As a firm heavily involved in cryptocurrency investment management and financial services, maintaining a large reserve of BTC is likely integral to their business model, supporting trading operations, investment products, and potentially balance sheet holdings. Comparing the figures: Transaction/Holding Amount (BTC) Approximate Value (USD) Recent Transfer (Single) 501 $53 million Transferred over 3 Days (Total) 1,001 $105.32 million Galaxy Digital’s Reported Total Holding 4,377 $462.37 million These figures illustrate the scale at which institutional players like Galaxy Digital operate within the crypto trading and investment space. What Can We Learn from Institutional Crypto Trading Activity? Observing the movements of large players like Jump Crypto and Galaxy Digital offers valuable insights for anyone interested in the cryptocurrency market. While not direct trading signals, they highlight the increasing maturity and institutional adoption of digital assets. Key takeaways often include: Confirmation of active institutional participation. Indications of potential supply/demand dynamics forming off-exchange. Understanding the relationships and flow of assets between major market participants. Contextualizing market volatility – sometimes large moves are operational, not purely directional bets. Tracking wallets associated with known institutional players, like the one holding Galaxy Digital’s reported balance, is a common practice for analysts trying to gauge institutional sentiment and activity levels in Institutional Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Challenges and Considerations While tracking institutional flows is informative, it’s not without challenges. Wallet attribution isn’t always definitive, and the exact purpose of a transfer is rarely publicly disclosed. Furthermore, large players can execute complex strategies involving multiple wallets and entities, making it difficult to piece together the full picture from on-chain data alone. There are also considerations around market impact and transparency. Large OTC deals, while necessary for volume, can sometimes make price discovery on public exchanges less efficient in the short term. Regulatory scrutiny on large transfers and institutional activity is also an ongoing factor in the market. Conclusion: The Pulse of Institutional Crypto The recent substantial Bitcoin transfer from Jump Crypto to Galaxy Digital is more than just a transaction; it’s a snapshot of the dynamic and rapidly evolving institutional crypto landscape. It underscores the significant capital and assets being managed and moved by major financial players. With over $105 million in BTC transferred over three days and Galaxy Digital now holding a reported $462 million in Bitcoin in one wallet, the scale of operations among these firms is clear. Whether these transfers are for trading, custody, or other strategic reasons, they are a testament to the growing integration of Bitcoin and other digital assets into traditional finance structures and sophisticated crypto trading strategies. Keeping an eye on these large institutional movements remains a crucial way to understand the undercurrents shaping the cryptocurrency market and the increasing adoption of Institutional Bitcoin .

The medical device company closed Friday’s session up 205% at $1.56 and is now up 213% over the past week. That momentum hasn’t slowed, with shares soaring another 100% in Monday’s pre-market trading to $3.13. KNW one-day stock price chart. Source: Google Finance The rally is fueling the announcement that Goldeneye 1995 LLC, an investment vehicle tied to Greg Kidd, former chief risk officer at Ripple, is acquiring a controlling stake in Know Labs using 1,000 Bitcoin and additional cash. At current prices, the Bitcoin component alone is worth over $105 million. Particulars of Know Labs acquisition Under the terms of the deal, Goldeneye will purchase common stock by dividing the total value of the 1,000 Bitcoin by Know Labs’ share price at the time of the agreement—$0.335. This structure significantly increases Goldeneye’s equity stake in the company. At the same time, Know Labs plans to retain Bitcoin as part of its treasury reserves, exposing investors to the digital currency . Once the acquisition is finalized, Kidd will take over as CEO and also assume the role of chairman of the board. “I’m thrilled to deploy a Bitcoin treasury strategy with the support of a forward-looking organization like Know Labs at a time when market and regulatory conditions are particularly favorable. We believe this approach will generate sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value,” Kidd said. Notably, the Seattle-based company specializes in noninvasive health monitoring technology . Its flagship product in development, KnowU, is a wearable, continuous glucose monitor that helps people with diabetes manage their blood sugar without needles. The device can be worn on the wrist, forearm, or as an adhesive patch with a removable sensor, offering a discreet and convenient alternative to traditional glucose testing.

2025-06-09T11:50:11,"Metaplanet Stock Soars 22% After Ambitious Bitcoin Buying Plan","Shares of Japanese investment firm Metaplanet (3350T) surged at the start of the June 9 trading session, following the company’s announcement of a bold new plan to raise $5.4 billion to purchase Bitcoin. The stock climbed over 12% early in the day, hitting 1,505 yen ($10.42), and peaked at 1,641 yen ($11.36), a 22% jump from the previous session. This surge comes as Metaplanet revises its Bitcoin strategy to target 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027—ten times its original goal. In an announcement dated June 6, Metaplanet unveiled this updated target under a new “stock acquisition rights program,” replacing its previous goal of 21,000 BTC. If the plan succeeds, Metaplanet would become the world’s second-largest corporate Bitcoin holder, trailing only Strategy, led by Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor. The “555 Million Plan” and Corporate BTC Trend Metaplanet’s revised target forms the foundation of what it calls the “555 million plan,” under which the company aims to acquire 201,112 BTC over the next few years—estimated to cost more than $21 billion at current prices. By the end of 2026, the firm hopes to hold at least 100,000 BTC. Currently, Metaplanet owns 8,888 BTC , including 1,088 acquired in its most recent purchase announced on June 2. This isn’t the first time the firm’s Bitcoin moves have influenced its share price. Since first disclosing BTC purchases in July 2024, Metaplanet’s stock has skyrocketed over 1,700%. It joins a growing list of companies globally adopting BTC as a treasury asset. South Korea’s K Wave Media recently joined the trend, while data from Bitbo shows corporate Bitcoin holdings now exceed three million BTC—about 3.2% of all BTC that will ever exist. Mixed Market Reactions to Bitcoin Strategies While Metaplanet’s shares have responded positively, other companies have experienced mixed outcomes after announcing Bitcoin acquisitions. Paris-based Blockchain Group’s stock rose 225% after BTC buys , and DigiAsia Corp saw a 91% increase. However, Norway’s K33 saw its share price dip by nearly 2% after similar news. Even GameStop, after announcing and executing its Bitcoin purchase , faced volatile market reactions. As Metaplanet pushes ahead with its ambitious acquisition roadmap, investor optimism appears high—but whether this translates into long-term value will depend on Bitcoin’s performance and broader market sentiment.

2025-06-09T11:48:49,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Will This Week’s CPI Report Trigger a Rally?","The post Bitcoin Price Prediction: Will This Week’s CPI Report Trigger a Rally? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin traders are on alert this week as U.S.-China trade talks begin and key U.S. inflation and job reports are set to be released. If inflation heats up, it could shake markets and impact Bitcoin’s price. Everyone’s watching closely over what’s next for Bitcoin. Bitcoin slightly recovered today and is currently trading at $107,423, up 1.8% in the past day. It traded flat near $105,650 after forming a doji candle on Sunday. Its network activity has also slowed with daily on-chain transactions dropping to a one-year low, according to Blockchain.com . Altcoins like XRP and DOGE also fell 1-2%. But they have recovered slightly today and are trading in green. Bitcoin Stuck In a Tight Range QCP Capital in a latest note shared that traders are keeping a close eye on Bitcoin as it stays stuck in a tight range heading into the summer. Even though implied volatility is at 1-year lows and looks cheap, actual price moves are even smaller. Historically, the short term volatility usually drops more by July, just like last year when Bitcoin struggled to break $70K and the volatility fell sharply. They pointed out that if Bitcoin breaks below $100K or jumps above $110K, it could spark fresh interest in the market. But for now, there is no clear event to push it that way. While the recent macro news caused quick and short live reactions for a moment, but those moves quickly faded without any lasting effect. Bitcoin Up For a Big Move In the Long Term? After the strong US jobs report boosted the stock market and caused gold prices to fall, Bitcoin was mostly unchanged and showed signs of slowing down. The trading activity in Bitcoin futures is increasing and fewer investor are putting money into Bitcoin ETFs. Traders are now betting on Bitcoin to do well later in the year, not anytime soon. Bitcoin might be gearing up for a move higher as fresh data shows a big liquidity zone around $106,736. These zones often pull price action like a magnet, and with BTC already testing $105K, a breakout could be on the way. New All-time Highs Soon? Also, Bitcoin’s realized profit/loss has dropped 90% since June 4, which means that fewer investors are selling at a loss. This reduces the selling pressure and supports a potential rise. With Bitcoin showing no clear direction on the daily chart, analysts believe that it might dip further before making a move toward new all-time highs. Analsyts at Swissblock warn that rising inflation could trigger volatility, and BTC may test support around $104K. Analyst Mickybull Crypto also sees a possible drop to $101,500 due to a head-and-shoulders pattern. If BTC loses the $100K level, it could face a deeper correction. ““Short-term correction, then new all-time highs,” he said. Bitcoin, what is the plan? Inflation data in the week ahead could unleash volatility. Bulls are slowly rebuilding structure and regrouping, eager to flip the game. First steps are in, but a short-term test of the lower range ($104k) looks likely. Stay sharp. pic.twitter.com/PI6HBSVyhL — Swissblock (@swissblock__) June 9, 2025 Analysts say that any price dip will be short-lived because the long-term uptrend is strong. Once it breaks the 2021 trendline, it could quickly climb to $140K–$150K. Bitcoin’s weekly chart also shows strong bullish signs with both a cup-and-handle and a bull flag pattern, pointing to a possible breakout above $109,000. These patterns suggest BTC could surge about 35%, reaching around $143,000. Key Events This Week- Market optimism is high as the U.S. China trade talks kick off in London, with Trump saying the meeting “should go very well.” All eyes are now on Wednesday’s US inflation report to see if the tariffs are pushing prices higher. If inflation is hotter than expected, it could reduce chances of Fed rate cuts and shake up markets.

Bitcoin Pepe: Meme Culture Meets Market Momentum Bitcoin PEPE has found a unique space in the presale crypto tokens market by combining humor with macro narratives. Its branding blends meme coin appeal with a speculative Bitcoin-linked theme, which has drawn strong attention across social platforms. So far, it has raised $13,934,128, with the token currently priced at $0.0396. Tokens are selling fast, and the limited supply is driving urgency. If it maintains momentum, it could mirror the success of past meme coins that delivered 100x gains. However, while Bitcoin PEPE has strong community backing, it lacks the utility and infrastructure offered by more technically grounded projects like Nexchain. For investors looking for short-term excitement, it has potential. But for those who want sustainable growth, utility-focused pre sale cryptocurrency projects may offer better upside. BlockDAG: High-Stakes Presale With Big Rewards BlockDAG is turning heads in the crypto ICO presale space with its “Buyer Battles” concept. Every day, the biggest buyer wins a share of 150 million BDAG tokens, making it a high-action presale that rewards bold participation. At just $0.0018 per token, BlockDAG offers one of the lowest entry points among all crypto coins on presale. The upcoming “GO LIVE” event on June 13 is expected to drive price shifts. Daily winners are already earning millions, creating urgency among sidelined investors. While it excels in presale gamification, BlockDAG is still early in terms of infrastructure and long-term utility. For thrill-seekers, it’s a compelling project. But when compared to a robust platform like Nexchain, it offers more risk and less foundational strength. Final Thoughts: Which Crypto Presale Stands Out? Each of these token presales brings a different appeal. Bitcoin PEPE leads in meme coin virality, while BlockDAG adds high-stakes excitement to the crypto presale scene. But when it comes to real-world tech, enterprise readiness, and long-term ROI, Nexchain is in a class of its own. Nexchain has raised nearly $4 million, built a live testnet, and already enables smart automation across industries. With a strong AI backbone, scalable performance, and active development, it offers much more than speculation. If you’re scanning the crypto presale list or researching the best crypto presale to buy right now, Nexchain stands out. It’s the only project in this comparison that blends utility, accessibility, and long-term vision, making it the smart pick in 2025’s crowded crypto presale market.

2025-06-09T11:40:34,"Crucial Economic Events This Week: What Crypto Investors Must Watch","BitcoinWorld Crucial Economic Events This Week: What Crypto Investors Must Watch Hello crypto enthusiasts! Navigating the cryptocurrency market isn’t just about tracking Bitcoin charts and altcoin news. Macroeconomic factors play a significant role, often driving volatility across all financial assets, including digital ones. This week brings several key US economic events this week that demand your attention. Understanding these releases can provide crucial insights into potential market movements. Why Do US Economic Events Matter for Crypto? You might wonder why data from the traditional US economy affects decentralized digital currencies. The answer lies in global market sentiment, liquidity, and interest rate expectations. Data indicating inflation trends or labor market health can influence the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions. Changes in interest rates and quantitative easing/tightening directly impact the flow of capital, affecting investor risk appetite. When investors are cautious due to economic uncertainty or rising rates, riskier assets like cryptocurrencies can see outflows. Conversely, signs of economic weakness might sometimes lead to expectations of dovish policy, potentially boosting risk assets. Therefore, keeping an eye on the economic events this week is essential for informed trading and investment decisions in the crypto space. Inflation Watch: Understanding CPI and PPI Data Inflation data is perhaps the most closely watched economic indicator right now, as it heavily influences central bank policy. This week features two major inflation reports: Wednesday, June 11th (12:30 UTC): U.S. Core CPI (YoY) (May) Thursday, June 12th (12:30 UTC): U.S. PPI (YoY) (May) The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. The Core CPI excludes volatile items like food and energy to give a clearer picture of underlying inflation trends. The Producer Price Index (PPI) measures the average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. It can be a leading indicator for CPI, as producer costs often pass on to consumers. Both reports are released on a Year-over-Year (YoY) basis, comparing prices to the same month in the previous year. This provides a broader perspective than monthly changes, smoothing out short-term fluctuations. What Does This Inflation Data Mean for Crypto? Higher-than-expected CPI data or PPI data can signal persistent inflation, potentially leading the Federal Reserve to maintain a hawkish stance (higher interest rates, tighter liquidity). This environment is generally seen as negative for risk assets like crypto. Conversely, data showing inflation is cooling could increase hopes for future rate cuts or a more dovish stance, which can be positive for crypto markets. Pay close attention to how these numbers compare to market expectations. Labor Market Insights: Keeping an Eye on Jobless Claims Beyond inflation, labor market health is another key indicator of economic momentum. While major reports like Non-Farm Payrolls are monthly, weekly data provides a continuous pulse: Thursday, June 12th (12:30 UTC): U.S. Initial Jobless Claims Initial Jobless Claims measure the number of individuals who filed for unemployment benefits for the first time during the past week. It’s a timely indicator of the health of the labor market. A significant increase in jobless claims can signal a weakening economy, potentially leading to reduced consumer spending and overall economic slowdown. How Do Jobless Claims Impact the Crypto Market? While not as directly impactful as inflation data, persistently rising jobless claims can contribute to recession fears. In such a scenario, investors might become more risk-a-averse, potentially pulling funds from speculative assets like crypto. However, significant labor market weakness could also increase the likelihood of the Fed cutting rates to stimulate the economy, which could eventually be seen as positive for risk assets. It’s a complex interplay, but monitoring this data provides another piece of the economic puzzle. Preparing for Potential Volatility With these crucial economic events this week on the calendar, market participants should prepare for potential volatility, particularly around the release times (12:30 UTC on Wednesday and Thursday). Unexpected results from the CPI data , PPI data , or jobless claims can trigger rapid price swings in both traditional markets and cryptocurrencies. Actionable Insights: Stay Informed: Keep these release times noted in your calendar. Monitor Reactions: Observe how markets, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, react immediately following the data releases. Manage Risk: If you are actively trading, consider adjusting position sizes or using stop-loss orders to manage potential sudden moves. Look Beyond the Headlines: Understand the context – is the data a one-off anomaly or part of a developing trend? Understanding the macroeconomic backdrop is a vital skill for anyone serious about navigating the crypto landscape. These upcoming US economic reports offer a chance to gauge the current state of inflation and the labor market, providing valuable context for potential shifts in market sentiment and monetary policy expectations, which ultimately influence the crypto market impact . Summary: Eyes on the Data This week presents key US economic data points that crypto investors and traders should monitor closely. The May Core CPI and PPI reports will offer fresh insights into inflation trends, while weekly Initial Jobless Claims will provide a snapshot of the labor market’s health. The outcomes of these releases, especially relative to expectations, can significantly influence market sentiment and potentially lead to increased volatility in the cryptocurrency market. Staying informed about these economic events this week is crucial for making more informed decisions in the dynamic world of digital assets.

2025-06-09T11:40:07,"Cetus and Alex Protocol Restore Services Following Major Exploits","In a challenging period for decentralized finance platforms, both Cetus Protocol and Alex Protocol have suffered major exploits, highlighting ongoing vulnerabilities in emerging DeFi ecosystems. Operating on the Sui and Stacks blockchains respectively, the two platforms lost a combined $231 million in recent attacks. Each has since announced user reimbursement plans and protocol upgrades, signaling a renewed commitment to security and resilience as the Bitcoin DeFi landscape matures. Cetus Protocol Relaunches After $223M Hack, Restores Majority of Liquidity Pools and Charts Path Forward In a major comeback for one of the most severely affected decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms this year, Cetus Protocol — a cross-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) operating on the Sui and Aptos blockchains — officially relaunched on Sunday following a devastating $223 million exploit on May 22. The protocol has not only restored full platform functionality but also managed to replenish between 85% and 99% of user funds in affected liquidity pools, according to an announcement from the Cetus team. The attack, which leveraged a critical integer overflow vulnerability in a shared math library used by Cetus’ smart contracts, allowed an unknown hacker to deposit a single token and have it appear as millions in value. The manipulation effectively enabled the draining of liquidity pools on the Sui side of the protocol in what has become the largest DeFi exploit of May 2025. Emergency Response and Partial Recovery In the immediate aftermath of the breach, Sui validators quickly moved to freeze $162 million of the stolen funds — a rare and controversial move in decentralized ecosystems. These funds have since been returned to Cetus Protocol. Combined with the platform’s remaining $7 million in treasury reserves and a substantial $30 million USDC loan provided by the Sui Foundation, Cetus was able to replenish the majority of user funds and bring the protocol back online. The team also confirmed that any remaining balances owed to liquidity providers (LPs) will be distributed in the form of CETUS tokens, the protocol’s native governance and utility token, over a 12-month linear vesting schedule. This repayment schedule is contingent on no further recovery of stolen assets from the hacker. According to blockchain security firm SlowMist, the attack was not spontaneous but carefully premeditated. The hacker funded a dedicated wallet two days prior to the incident, ensuring sufficient gas to carry out the exploit. An earlier attempt to execute the same exploit failed, signaling a high level of technical sophistication and iterative planning. The exploit hinged on the checked_shlw function, which was manipulated using highly specific parameters to create the illusion of massive token deposits. While the damage was extensive, it was limited solely to the Sui-based pools. Cetus’ Aptos-based pools remained untouched, as the vulnerability did not exist in those smart contracts. Ongoing Challenges and Asset Laundering Despite the successful relaunch and partial recovery, the protocol faces an uphill battle in reclaiming tens of millions of dollars still under the attacker’s control. The hacker has reportedly moved some of the assets to an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) address and initiated transfers through Tornado Cash, a well-known transaction obfuscation tool. “The attacker ignored our previous whitehat offer and has begun attempting to launder assets — a futile and traceable act,” Cetus wrote in its official statement. “We are highly confident that successful arrest and recovering the remaining assets is only a matter of time.” In an effort to rebuild trust with users and the broader DeFi community, Cetus Protocol has pledged to launch another round of extensive smart contract audits. Additionally, the team plans to upgrade the platform’s real-time monitoring systems and introduce a new white-hat bounty program aimed at proactively identifying and resolving vulnerabilities. “This restart signifies more than just a relaunch, but a renewal,” the team stated, signaling a broader transformation in how the protocol approaches security and development going forward. While the relaunch is being hailed as a resilient response in a sector still haunted by high-profile exploits, it hasn't spared CETUS from bearish market reactions. The token has declined approximately 44% since the day before the attack, according to data from CoinGecko. However, renewed confidence from the community, strengthened governance, and strategic backing from the Sui Foundation could help support a long-term recovery. A Cautionary Tale with Lessons for All of DeFi The Cetus incident serves as yet another reminder of the fragility of DeFi protocols and the devastating consequences of even the smallest unchecked vulnerability in smart contracts. While the protocol’s swift action and transparent communications have helped soften the blow for many users, the event shows the need for continuous auditing, better tooling for anomaly detection, and stricter internal security frameworks in the world of permissionless finance. The success or failure of Cetus Protocol’s revival may ultimately depend on how well it can turn this painful experience into a springboard for reform — and on whether it can recover the remaining assets still circulating in dark corners of the blockchain. SUI Price Jumps 3% The SUI price responded positively to the news, with CoinMarketCap data showing the altcoin gained over 3% in the last 24 hours. As a result, the crypto is trading at $3.32 at press time, and is around 37% away from the all-time high (ATH) of $5.35 that it set on Jan. 6, 2025. Alex Protocol Suffers $8.3M Exploit on Stacks Blockchain, Promises Full Reimbursement to Users In another serious setback for DeFi, Alex Protocol—a flagship DeFi platform built on the Stacks blockchain—confirmed it had fallen victim to a significant exploit on June 6, 2025, resulting in the loss of approximately $8.3 million in digital assets. The attack has emerged as one of the most damaging hacks to date on the Stacks network and has once again raised pressing questions around security in the growing Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem. The exploit was caused by a vulnerability in the protocol’s self-listing verification logic, which the attacker leveraged to siphon off funds from several liquidity pools. In a statement on X , Alex Protocol said it had identified the breach and was working with relevant stakeholders to mitigate further fallout. Millions Drained Across Multiple Assets The attacker managed to extract a diverse array of assets, including: 8.4 million Stacks (STX) tokens 21.85 Stacks Bitcoin (sBTC) 149,850 USDC and USDT stablecoins 2.8 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) Based on prevailing prices at the time, the total haul amounted to more than $8.3 million—a sum that underscores the gravity of the exploit and represents a substantial hit to liquidity providers on the platform. Despite the scale of the incident, Alex Protocol moved quickly to assure its user base that affected funds would be fully reimbursed using the organization’s treasury reserves. The reimbursement plan, coordinated by the Alex Lab Foundation, aims to restore user trust and prevent a mass exodus from the protocol amid growing concerns over smart contract vulnerabilities. Alex Lab announced that all compensation will be issued in USDC, a widely used stablecoin, and calculated based on average onchain exchange rates between 10:00 am and 2:00 pm UTC on the day of the attack. The foundation stated that it believes this time window provides a fair and representative basis for restoring lost value. Affected wallets are expected to receive an onchain notification by June 8, along with a personalized claim form. Users must fill out the form with a preferred receiving wallet address by June 10. The team has committed to verifying claims and distributing the reimbursements within seven days of claim confirmation. Users who do not receive a notification were encouraged to contact the team via email. Lack of Technical Disclosure — For Now While the team has been transparent in acknowledging the attack and outlining reimbursement plans, it has not yet released a technical post-mortem. The community is currently awaiting a detailed report that will provide insight into how the flaw in the self-listing logic was exploited and what changes will be implemented to prevent a recurrence. The incident has drawn attention from the broader crypto community, with many questioning whether current smart contract auditing practices on Stacks-based DeFi platforms are sufficient to handle increasingly sophisticated threats. This is not the first time Alex Protocol has been hit by a significant exploit. In May 2024, the platform experienced a $4.3 million hack involving its cross-chain bridge infrastructure. That exploit led to unauthorized withdrawals of assets and was later linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group, one of the most notorious state-sponsored cybercrime operations in the world. Following the 2024 attack, Alex Protocol partnered with prominent blockchain investigator ZachXBT to trace the stolen funds. The group had also worked with various analytics platforms and law enforcement agencies to identify wallet addresses involved in the theft, but full recovery of funds was never publicly confirmed. The recurrence of high-profile breaches raises alarm bells not only for Alex Protocol but also for the Stacks ecosystem, which aims to bring smart contract functionality and DeFi capabilities to the Bitcoin blockchain. With increased attention from regulators and investors alike, the pressure is mounting on DeFi platforms to drastically improve their security posture. Looking Ahead: Reputation on the Line For now, the Alex Lab Foundation’s swift pledge to reimburse users has helped ease the initial shock. But the long-term survival and reputation of the protocol will hinge on its ability to patch vulnerabilities, enhance internal security processes, and rebuild user confidence through transparency and strong governance. With over $12 million in total losses across two major attacks in just over a year, the platform faces an uphill battle. Whether it can bounce back will depend on how effectively it addresses both the technical shortcomings and the growing perception that it remains a soft target in an increasingly hostile DeFi landscape.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9492/cetus-and-alex-protocol-restore-services-following-major-exploits,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MINING|TRADING|SUI","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-09T11:39:49,"Bitcoin (BTC) Hits a New ATH, But It’s Not What You Think","TL;DR One important BTC metric reached a new all-time high, highlighting strong adoption and optimism across investors. Analysts see potential for BTC to hit nearly $120K, but with RSI nearing 70, a short-term correction could be looming. Not the Peak the Bulls Expected Despite the retreat after hitting a new historical peak of almost $112,000 on May 22 , Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has been booming in the past several months. Currently, it is worth just over $107,000, representing a 53% increase on a yearly basis. The bull run coincides with the rising number of BTC holders, which, according to the crypto analytics platform, reached a new all-time high of 55.39 million. The development can be interpreted as an optimistic sign, as it indicates growing adoption and higher demand for the primary cryptocurrency. As crypto markets attempt to rally at the end of the work week, crypto networks continue to grow over time.

The X user Captain Faibik recently claimed that the valuation could surge to a new all-time high of over $113,000 should it break the resistance level of $105,700. CryptoBullet chipped in, too. They noted BTC’s recent resurgence above $107,000, suggesting that the price “is ready to go higher” and set a target of $119,000. On the other hand, investors should keep an eye on Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index, which neared overbought territory at almost 70. This signals that the asset’s valuation has increased too rapidly over a short period, which could be a precursor to a correction.

2025-06-09T11:35:07,"Europe’s first Bitcoin Treasury firm plans to raise $340m to buy more BTC","Adam Back-supported Bitcoin Treasury firm, Blockchain Group, wants to raise $340 million through ‘ATM-type’ shares as a way to raise capital with the intention of boosting its BTC holdings. In a recent press release , the Paris-based company declared that it will be partnering with asset manager TOBAM to raise capital to boost its Bitcoin ( BTC ) Treasury. By allowing TOBAM to subscribe to ordinary shares issued by Blockchain Group, the firm hopes to raise a total revenue of $340 million which they will use to boost its BTC holdings. “The Program allows TOBAM, on a daily basis, to subscribe to ordinary shares of the Company by submitting a subscription request after market close. Each request is subject to pricing and volume limits based on the market conditions,” wrote Blockchain Group. At press time, BTC has gone up by nearly 2% and is currently trading at $107,126. In the past week, BTC has gone up nearly 2.5%. If Blockchain Group does manage to raise $340 million, then it stands a chance to add more than 3171.46 BTC to its Bitcoin Treasury. The Blockchain Group currently owns a total of 1,471 BTC ($157.5 million), including 624 BTC acquired in a recent purchase and 847 BTC held previously. The program follows a structure called “At The Market” pricing, which is similar to the a model usually affiliated with U.S. companies. Instead of releasing all the shares into the market, Blockchain Group intends to sell shares directly at market prices, in tranches, and only under certain limits.

According to the press release, the company plans to sell the share price at a limit that’s either higher than the stock market closing price or at the volume weighted average price of the trading day before TOBAM’s request. Based on the company’s shareholder general meeting results, the firm has agreed to issue a maximum nominal amount of €500 million ($570 million) in nominal value. Although, the increase will only take place if it is authorized by the Blockchain Group’s board. Blockchain Group has adopted a Bitcoin accumulation strategy since November 2024, becoming the first European company to start a Bitcoin Treasury.

The final leg of the decline on June 5th saw over $875 million in long liquidations in a single day—highlighting the extent of deleveraging. With over $1.9 billion in total liquidations across the past week, leverage has now been forcefully reset. Technical structure shows that BTC’s ascent was underpinned by genuine demand, as shown by a spot-led stair-step rally , with key accumulation clusters forming at $93,000–96,000, and $102,000–104,000. On-chain indicators now point to rising sell pressure as older holders begin to distribute. The Spent Supply Distribution (SSD) quantiles and Short-Term Holder (STH) Cost Basis bands offer a clear roadmap. The SSD 0.95 quantile at $103,700 marks the first support zone, followed by $97,100 (STH Cost Basis) and $95,600 (SSD 0.85), with $83,200 as the key risk-off level. These levels are crucial as they reflect cost basis zones for large holders and recent buyers, serving as potential demand re-entry points or liquidation triggers. In a nutshell, Bitcoin is now at a crossroads—balanced between structural support and waning bullish momentum, waiting for its next macro cue. The US macroeconomic landscape continues to show signs of strain as job growth slowed in May, reflecting early pressure from ongoing trade tensions and tariff uncertainty. While wage gains remained solid, a shrinking labour force and downward revisions to past employment data suggest the labour market’s resilience is beginning to erode. At the same time, both the manufacturing and services sectors contracted , driven by rising input costs and declining demand, underscoring the widespread impact of tariffs across the economy. Construction spending has also declined for three straight months, and inflationary pressures are mounting as businesses struggle to absorb higher costs. On the trade front, the US deficit narrowed due to falling imports—particularly from China—but this decline signals weakening demand rather than strength, raising concerns about future inventory shortages and inflation. Meanwhile, investor appetite for long-term US debt is faltering , with auction data and futures markets pointing to skepticism about fiscal stability. Crypto adoption is accelerating on multiple fronts, with IG Group becoming the first UK-listed company to offer spot crypto trading to retail investors. Partnering with Uphold, IG now enables direct purchases of bitcoin and other tokens, marking a shift from speculative derivatives to true asset ownership. This move coincides with the UK Financial Conduct Authority’s proposal to lift its ban on crypto exchange-traded notes (cETNs) for retail investors, signalling broader regulatory support for digital assets. Meanwhile, Japan’s Metaplanet announced a ¥850 billion ($5.4 billion) equity raise to aggressively expand its bitcoin holdings, aiming for 210,000 BTC by 2027—underscoring Asia’s growing role in institutional crypto adoption.

In response, the latter has made its stance clear. According to recent comments by CEO Paolo Ardoino, Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin USDT, has no plans to go public. Ardoino shared the company’s position in a conversation on X, responding to questions about whether plans for an IPO might be in the works. “No need to go public,” Ardoino said .

2025-06-09T11:30:37,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Holds Firm at 62: Navigating the Greed Zone","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index Holds Firm at 62: Navigating the Greed Zone In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, understanding the prevailing mood of market participants can be as crucial as analyzing price charts. One popular tool for gauging this collective emotion is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . This index provides a simple snapshot of whether the market is leaning towards fear or greed, offering insights into potential shifts in momentum. What Exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, developed by Alternative.me, is designed to visualize the current crypto market sentiment . It aggregates various data sources to distill the overall feeling among crypto investors into a single number between 0 and 100. Think of it as a market mood ring. A value close to 0 indicates ‘Extreme Fear’. This often suggests investors are overly worried, potentially leading to panic selling. Historically, extreme fear periods can sometimes present buying opportunities for those with a higher risk tolerance. A value close to 100 indicates ‘Extreme Greed’. This typically means investors are overly optimistic, possibly experiencing FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), which can lead to excessive buying and potentially an overheated market ripe for a correction. The index serves as a temperature check, helping market participants understand the emotional state driving short-term price movements. Current Status: Holding Steady in the Greed Zone As of the latest update, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index stands at 62. Importantly, this reading remains unchanged from the previous day. This score places the index squarely in the ‘Greed’ zone. Staying at 62 indicates a consistent level of positive sentiment and buying interest in the market. While not in the ‘Extreme Greed’ territory (typically above 75), a reading of 62 still reflects a market where optimism is prevalent and participants are generally comfortable taking on more risk. What Factors Drive the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index isn’t just a random number; it’s calculated based on a weighted average of six key factors, each designed to capture different aspects of crypto market sentiment : Volatility (25%): This measures the current market’s price swings compared to average historical values. Higher volatility in an upward trend can indicate a greedy market, while high volatility during a downturn points to fear. It helps assess current crypto volatility levels. Market Momentum / Volume (25%): This factor looks at the current trading volume and market momentum compared to historical averages. High buying volume in a positive market suggests greed, while high selling volume indicates fear. Social Media (15%): This analyzes sentiment and engagement on social media platforms related to cryptocurrencies. Positive sentiment and high interaction often correlate with greed. Surveys (15%): While currently paused by Alternative.me, this component historically involved weekly sentiment surveys to gauge investor feelings directly. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin dominance measures Bitcoin’s market cap share relative to the total crypto market cap. An increasing Bitcoin dominance can sometimes signal fear (as investors flee altcoins to the perceived safety of Bitcoin), while decreasing dominance can indicate greed (as investors move funds into riskier altcoins hoping for higher returns). Google Trends (10%): This analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on Google Trends. Rising search interest, especially for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “crypto crash,” can indicate fear, while terms like “buy crypto” or specific coin names might suggest greed. By combining these diverse data points, the index aims to provide a more holistic view of the market’s emotional state. Understanding What the ‘Greed Zone’ Signifies Being in the greed zone , particularly at a level like 62, suggests several things about the current market environment: Optimism is High: Investors are generally feeling positive about the market’s prospects. Increased Buying Pressure: There is likely significant demand, potentially driven by positive news, price increases, or FOMO. Potential for Overextension: While not extreme, being in the upper half of the index suggests the market might be getting ahead of itself, increasing the risk of a sudden pullback or correction. FOMO is Present: The fear of missing out on potential gains can drive irrational buying behavior. It’s important to remember that ‘greed’ in this context isn’t necessarily a moral judgment, but rather a descriptor of the market’s collective emotional state and associated behavior patterns. Navigating the Greed Zone: Actionable Insights for Investors When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index sits comfortably in the greed zone , it’s a signal to approach the market with thoughtful consideration rather than impulsive action. Here are some actionable insights: Practice Caution: While the trend may be positive, a greedy market can reverse quickly. Avoid making decisions based purely on emotion or FOMO. Revisit Your Strategy: Use this time to review your investment plan. Are you sticking to your long-term goals, or are short-term gains tempting you to deviate? Consider Risk Management: High greed can coincide with increased crypto volatility . Ensure you have stop-loss orders in place or consider taking some profits if that aligns with your strategy. Focus on Fundamentals: Don’t let positive sentiment blind you to the underlying fundamentals of the projects you’re invested in. Avoid Leverage if Unexperienced: High greed periods can be particularly dangerous for leveraged trading due to potential sharp reversals. Look at Other Indicators: The index is just one tool. Combine its insights with technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and macro factors. Navigating a greedy market requires discipline. The goal is to avoid getting swept up in the euphoria and make rational decisions. Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a Crystal Ball? No, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is not a predictive tool. It doesn’t tell you where the price will go next. It’s a sentiment indicator, reflecting the *current* emotional state of the market based on historical patterns. Its value lies in highlighting potential extremes. When the index is at 80+ (Extreme Greed) or below 20 (Extreme Fear), it often correlates with significant market tops or bottoms, respectively. However, a mid-range greed score like 62 suggests a strong positive bias, but not necessarily an imminent crash. It’s a piece of the puzzle, not the whole picture. Conclusion: Keeping an Eye on Crypto Market Sentiment The fact that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index remains unchanged at 62, firmly within the greed zone , signals continued optimism and strong positive crypto market sentiment . While this reflects current upward momentum, it also serves as a reminder that caution is warranted in any market experiencing significant greed. Understanding the factors that influence the index, from crypto volatility to Bitcoin dominance , provides valuable context. By using the index as one of many tools in your analysis, you can gain a better perspective on the market’s emotional temperature and make more informed decisions when navigating the greed zone .

The cryptocurrency was trading below $106,000 throughout the morning session but the bulls took control and pushed the price up, liquidating around $60 million worth of short positions in the past four hours alone.

The delegations of both countries have arrived in London and are about to commence talks to stabilize the fragile trade truce, according to Walter Bloomberg on X.

2025-06-09T11:22:31,"Why Cathie Wood Sees Bitcoin at $1.5 Million in Next 5 Years","The post Why Cathie Wood Sees Bitcoin at $1.5 Million in Next 5 Years appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood has made another bold call: Bitcoin could hit $1.5 million by 2030. That’s a 15x surge from its current price, and she says it’s not just a guess. It’s based on growing demand from some of the world’s biggest investors. Speaking on the YouTube show The Diary of a CEO , Wood laid out her reasons, pointing to a sharp rise in institutional interest and Bitcoin’s role as a new kind of financial asset. Institutional Investors Are Driving Bitcoin’s Rise Wood emphasized that large institutions are now entering the Bitcoin market in a big way. Companies like Arkham, Strategy, and Metaplanet are among the major names moving into BTC, signaling a shift in how traditional finance views crypto. She explained that Bitcoin’s volatility is decreasing as more investors hold it long-term. Compared to stocks, bonds, real estate, or commodities, Bitcoin behaves differently – making it a valuable tool for diversifying investment portfolios. Wood also noted that Bitcoin is unlike any asset we’ve seen since the introduction of equities in the 1600s. That makes it especially attractive to financial institutions managing trillions of dollars. Bitcoin’s Unique Role as a Diversifier Since Bitcoin doesn’t move in the same patterns as traditional assets, it’s catching the attention of institutional players looking for better ways to spread risk. Wood believes this unique quality is forcing big funds to take Bitcoin seriously, even those who were previously hesitant. According to her, institutional investors are only now realizing Bitcoin’s full potential, and they’re starting to act fast. Supply Is Shrinking While Demand Rises One of Wood’s key arguments is based on Bitcoin’s limited supply. Only about one million BTC remain to be mined, which translates to roughly $100 billion in new market value. That’s not much when you consider the trillions of dollars sitting in institutional funds. “There’s a lot of incremental demand, and someone’s going to have to sell,” she noted. She warned that this supply crunch is likely to drive prices much higher. As demand builds, someone will have to sell, creating strong upward pressure on price. 2025 Bull Run Fueled by Institutions This shift is already happening. Analysts at Matrixport found that Bitcoin’s recent rally to $111,814 was largely driven by institutions, not retail traders like in past bull markets. Supporting this trend, a report from Standard Chartered revealed that 61 corporate treasuries now hold a combined 3.2% of the total Bitcoin supply. Japan-based Metaplanet recently announced plans to acquire 210,000 BTC by 2027. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s company Strategy already holds 580,955 BTC – around 2.7% of all Bitcoin in circulation. Cathie Wood’s Top 10 Investment Picks In the same interview , Wood shared her top 10 investment picks. Tesla was her number one choice. She believes the company will bounce back despite its recent dip. Other names on her list included Coinbase, Robinhood, and Roku – further showing her preference for innovative, high-growth companies. ARK Invest Raises Its Target ARK Invest has also raised its long-term Bitcoin price target. In its April report, the firm projected a $2.4 million price by 2030 – if on-chain financial services continue growing at an annual rate of 60%. If these conditions hold, Wood believes Bitcoin is on track to become a major pillar of global finance. Final Thoughts? Cathie Wood’s $1.5 million Bitcoin prediction may seem extreme, but it’s backed by strong reasoning and market data. With institutional adoption rising and supply getting tighter, Bitcoin’s future could be even bigger than most expect. Bitcoin is no longer on the sidelines. It’s fast becoming a serious force in the world of finance.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-cathie-wood-sees-bitcoin-at-1-5-million-in-next-5-years/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ARKM","News",cryptocompare
