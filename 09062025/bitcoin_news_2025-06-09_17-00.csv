2025-06-09T14:56:13,"Analyst Says This Rejection Is Dangerous for Bitcoin","Bitcoin (BTC) is once again at a crucial technical crossroads, with market participants closely watching the $106,900 resistance level. According to Ali, a respected crypto analyst known for his data-driven insights on X, Bitcoin’s current price behavior demands caution. In a recent post, he emphasized the significance of this key threshold, warning that a failure to break above it convincingly could trigger a substantial retracement for the flagship cryptocurrency. A Decisive Resistance Barrier At the heart of Ali’s analysis is the $106,900 price level, which has emerged as a decisive resistance point for Bitcoin. While BTC has made several attempts to reclaim this territory, each rally toward this zone has been met with increasing selling pressure. Wait for a sustained close above $106,900 before you turn bullish on #Bitcoin $BTC because a rejection here could send it back to $105,000 or even $103,500. pic.twitter.com/ojwWu7pKdG — Ali (@ali_charts) June 9, 2025 Ali urges traders and investors to refrain from a bullish stance until the asset can produce a sustained close above this threshold. His caution stems from the likelihood that rejection at this level could result in a sharp correction, potentially driving the price down to $105,000, or even lower, toward $103,500. This resistance has become a psychological and technical barrier, particularly as Bitcoin continues to trade in a relatively tight range amid broader market uncertainty. A clean break and hold above $106,900, according to Ali, would signify renewed bullish momentum and likely open the door to higher highs. However, absent that confirmation, the risk of downside cannot be overlooked. Short-Term Risk of Rejection Ali’s post is backed by an on-chain and technical overview that suggests bearish undertones beneath Bitcoin’s surface-level stability. While volatility remains suppressed relative to the explosive moves witnessed earlier in the year, the threat of a sudden downturn looms. If the price is rejected at $106,900, it would confirm bearish dominance at this resistance level and potentially trigger a wave of sell-offs from traders who were anticipating a breakout. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 His warning comes at a time when Bitcoin is already under pressure from several macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. Regulatory uncertainty in key markets, investor repositioning amid changing U.S. interest rate expectations, and fluctuating institutional inflows have all contributed to Bitcoin’s recent hesitations. These elements, combined with the technical resistance described by Ali, reinforce the idea that a premature bullish bias could lead to painful consequences. Market Context and Broader Implications The stakes are particularly high at this juncture . A successful breakout would likely boost investor confidence, attracting new institutional investment and improving overall market sentiment. Conversely, a failed attempt to break higher could reinforce bearish structures on higher timeframes, leading to a reevaluation of near-term bullish theses. It is also worth noting that this rejection point aligns with liquidity zones that have historically seen high-volume rejections, suggesting that large entities might be using this level to offload or short BTC positions. If this behavior continues, it could further weaken Bitcoin’s short-term outlook. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-06-09T14:54:15,"Tether to start open-sourcing its Bitcoin mining OS","Stablecoin issuer Tether plans to open-source its Bitcoin Mining Operating System, allowing companies of all sizes to access and operate mining infrastructure independently, without relying on proprietary third-party software. The announcement was made by Tether ( USDT ) CEO Paolo Ardoino, who described the initiative as a push to “make mining great again.” Tether’s MOS is built with a scalable, peer-to-peer IoT architecture that can adapt from small setups using Raspberry Pi boards to large mining sites managing hundreds of thousands of machines. It already supports a wide array of mining hardware vendors, air-cooled and immersion containers, and electrical components such as thermostats. By open-sourcing the platform, Tether aims to reduce barriers to entry for new and smaller mining firms . Ardoino said this could help decentralize the Bitcoin ( BTC ) network by enabling more participants to contribute to mining, thereby enhancing security and reducing the concentration of power held by publicly listed mining giants. “New Bitcoin mining companies will be able to enter the game and compete to keep the network safe,” Ardoino said on X. “MOS will create an even playing field.” You might also like: Strategy adds 1,045 Bitcoin worth $110m, bringing total to 582,000 BTC Custom plugins A key feature of the open-source MOS is its modular plugin system. Developers will be able to create and share custom plugins tailored to specific hardware or site needs, fostering a collaborative development environment. Tether also envisions integrating MOS with its internal data platform QVAC and artificial intelligence tools for performance optimization based on mining data. The open-sourcing could prove especially impactful for small-to-mid-sized enterprises producing their own energy, such as solar or hydro-powered businesses, who may now find it easier to participate in Bitcoin mining using surplus electricity. Tether is preparing the MOS release for Q4 2025, including documentation and user guides. The move signals a broader shift in the mining industry toward open access and decentralized control of infrastructure.

2025-06-09T14:52:40,"Michael Saylor’s Strategy Scoops 1,045 BTC for $110M – Trove Tops $40B Near Record Highs","Strategy, led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, announced on Monday that it has once again increased its Bitcoin holdings, acquiring 1,045 BTC for approximately $110.2 million. This latest purchase, disclosed in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing on June 9, 2025, was made at an average price of $105,426 per coin, just as Bitcoin flirts with its all-time high (ATH). The move marks the ninth week the company has added to its Bitcoin reserves, continuing its aggressive accumulation strategy. Strategy has acquired 1,045 BTC for ~$110.2 million at ~$105,426 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 17.1% YTD 2025. As of 6/8/2025, we hodl 582,000 $BTC acquired for ~$40.79 billion at ~$70,086 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF $STRD https://t.co/9cpK5vtVwW — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 9, 2025 Strategy’s Bitcoin Trove Now Valued at Over $40B With this latest buy, Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings have reached about 582,000 BTC. The company has spent approximately $40.79 billion to amass its crypto treasury, with an average purchase price of around $70,086 per Bitcoin. As BTC trades near its record highs, Strategy’s holdings are not only historic in size but potentially highly profitable—especially given the company’s early and consistent buying behavior through various market cycles. The firm’s commitment to Bitcoin, initially spearheaded by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, has transformed it into the largest corporate holder of the digital asset. Strategy’s BTC approach has become a core part of its identity, drawing both institutional interest and market scrutiny. Institutional Confidence Grows as Crypto Matures This recent acquisition suggests more than just bullish sentiment—it reflects a broader institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Strategy’s ongoing accumulation suggests it views BTC as a strategic treasury asset, comparable to digital gold. By continuing its at-the-market offering programs and funneling proceeds into Bitcoin, the company is effectively doubling down on its bet that Bitcoin will continue to appreciate and outperform traditional assets over time. As the crypto market matures and regulatory clarity slowly improves, Strategy’s moves may inspire other firms to adopt similar treasury allocation models. Saylor’s Cryptic ‘Send More Orange’ Message On Sunday, Saylor posted a chart of the company’s BTC holdings, saying that Strategy plans to increase its Bitcoin purchases. “Send more Orange,” his message read, as Orange is widely recognized as a symbol for Bitcoin among the crypto community. Saylor has a history of posting on Sundays before his Bitcoin purchases. However, a recent report from K33 Research revealed that Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, appears to have slowed down its Bitcoin buys. K33 Head of Research Vetle Lunde attributed this to a declining premium for MSTR shares relative to the company’s Bitcoin holdings.

2025-06-09T14:40:02,"Bitcoin Price: 5 Crucial Factors Shaping the Market This Week","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price: 5 Crucial Factors Shaping the Market This Week Are you watching the Bitcoin price ? The cryptocurrency market is always dynamic, and staying informed about the key drivers can make a significant difference in understanding potential price movements. This week, several critical factors are on the radar, according to analysis highlighted by Cointelegraph. Let’s dive into the details that could influence the trajectory of BTC price . Watching Key Bitcoin Price Levels One of the most fundamental aspects of Bitcoin analysis involves monitoring key support and resistance levels. This week, the focus is sharply on two specific price points: Support at $100,000: Can Bitcoin hold this significant psychological and technical level? Maintaining support here is crucial for preventing further downside momentum. Resistance at $106,600: Breaking through this resistance level is seen as a necessary step for bulls to regain control and potentially push the price higher. A successful breach could signal a shift in short-term sentiment. These levels act like battlegrounds between buyers and sellers. A failure to hold support or break resistance can often dictate the market’s direction in the short term. Understanding BTC Price Liquidations Liquidation levels represent price points where leveraged trading positions are automatically closed out. Large clusters of liquidations can act as magnets for price, as cascading closures can accelerate moves up or down. Cointelegraph’s analysis points to key areas this week: Concentrated long liquidations near $100,000: This reinforces the importance of the $100k support. If this level is breached, a cascade of long liquidations could amplify the downward move. Short liquidations around $112,000: On the upside, a move towards $112k could trigger short liquidations, potentially fueling a rapid upward spike as short sellers are forced to buy back their positions. Monitoring these liquidation maps provides insight into where significant volatility might occur if these price levels are tested. How US CPI Data Impacts the Crypto Market Macroeconomic data, particularly related to inflation, has a significant impact on the broader financial markets, including the crypto market . This week, two crucial U.S. inflation indicators are scheduled for release: May Consumer Price Index (CPI): This is a key measure of inflation from the consumer’s perspective. May Producer Price Index (PPI): This tracks inflation at the wholesale level. Why is this important for Bitcoin price ? Bitcoin is often discussed as an inflation hedge. High inflation numbers can sometimes boost this narrative, potentially increasing demand. Conversely, cooling inflation might reduce the urgency for such hedges. More importantly, inflation data heavily influences the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions regarding interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect liquidity and investor appetite for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Is the Short-Term Holder Cost Basis a Key Bitcoin Analysis Point? On-chain metrics provide unique insights into market behavior. One such metric is the short-term holder cost basis, which represents the average price at which Bitcoin was acquired by entities holding BTC for less than 155 days. This week, the level to watch is $106,200. Reclaiming the short-term holder cost basis is often considered a bullish signal. It suggests that recent buyers, who are typically more sensitive to price fluctuations, are, on average, no longer underwater. This can reduce selling pressure from this cohort and potentially pave the way for further price appreciation. External Factors Influencing the Crypto Market Beyond technical levels and economic data, external developments can sometimes inject volatility or noise into the crypto market . While the direct impact can be hard to predict, market sentiment can be swayed by prominent figures or geopolitical events. Cointelegraph specifically mentioned potential market impact from external developments, including tensions between U.S. President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. While the direct link to BTC price might seem tenuous, comments or actions from influential figures, especially those with a history of impacting crypto sentiment (like Musk), can sometimes trigger reactions in the market, particularly in a news cycle-driven environment. Bringing It All Together: Actionable Insights So, what does this all mean for you as a market observer or participant? This week requires vigilance across multiple fronts: Watch the $100k support and $106.6k resistance levels closely for technical breakouts or breakdowns. Be aware of the liquidation zones and how price action near them could trigger accelerated moves. Pay close attention to the U.S. CPI and PPI releases and understand how they might influence broader market sentiment and expectations for monetary policy. Monitor if Bitcoin reclaims the short-term holder cost basis around $106,200, as this could signal improving market structure. Stay generally aware of major external news events, recognizing they can sometimes add unpredictable volatility. Navigating the crypto market successfully often involves considering a confluence of factors, not just one. This week’s watch points highlight the interplay between technical indicators, on-chain data, macroeconomic forces, and even external news. Conclusion: Stay Informed, Stay Ahead The coming week presents a complex picture for the Bitcoin price , influenced by critical technical levels, significant liquidation clusters, key economic data releases like CPI data , important on-chain metrics, and potential external noise. By keeping an eye on these five crucial factors, market participants can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the forces currently shaping the crypto market and be better prepared for potential price swings.

2025-06-09T14:39:41,"IXS crypto surges on user spike, but pullback could follow","IX Swap token price surged for four consecutive days, reaching its highest level since March 4. IX Swap ( IXS ) climbed to a high of $0.2692, marking a 155% increase from its April low. The rally coincided with a sharp rise in on-chain activity, as the number of active addresses jumped to 300, the highest since February. This spike in engagement likely reflects increased retail participation driven by fear of missing out. A good example of this is that its social dominance soared to 0.024%, the highest point since June last year. Also, the network growth soared to 176, up from last week’s low of 12. IXS token on-chain metrics | Source: Santiment There was no specific news catalyst behind the IXS surge. As such, the move may be part of a pump-and-dump pattern, which is common among low-cap, thinly traded tokens. IXS currently has a market capitalization of $42 million, with most of its trading volume concentrated on Uniswap ( UNI ). The token is not listed on major tier-1 exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, or Upbit. You might also like: Shiba Inu price plot thickens as whales dump continues Another potential factor behind the move could be anticipation of a major announcement, such as a new partnership or exchange listing. It’s common for crypto tokens to rally in advance of such news. Fundamentally, the IXS ecosystem remains relatively weak, with total value locked (TVL) in the network at just $449,844. IXS’s platform allows Bitcoin ( BTC ) holders to monetize idle assets by earning yields between 4% and 10% without selling. Users pledge BTC as collateral, receive USDT, and deploy it into regulated, fixed-income real-world assets. IXS crypto price technical analysis IXS price chart | Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that IXS bottomed at $0.1370 last week before rallying to $0.2676 on Monday, its highest point since March. The token briefly traded above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages, as well as the Ichimoku cloud indicator. Given this sharp move, a near-term pullback appears likely as traders begin to take profits. If this occurs, price could fall toward the lower boundary of the channel near $0.1398. Conversely, a breakout above the channel’s upper bound at $0.2676 would open the door for further gains, with the next resistance sitting at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.3980.

2025-06-09T14:32:34,"Why Gleec Transitioned From Secure Communications To Payments & Tokenized Art","The post Why Gleec Transitioned From Secure Communications To Payments & Tokenized Art appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News For most blockchain developers these days, the focus of their efforts is no longer just about digital assets. Rather, it’s about building an ecosystem around those assets as a way of making them more “useful” for the people who own them. With an expansive blockchain ecosystem, cryptocurrencies gain more purpose and utility, and that will often translate to increased demand. And if a digital asset is in high demand, there’s every chance its value will increase, much to the delight of anyone who owns it. In the context of blockchain ecosystems, cryptocurrencies become a kind of “digital oil” that greases the wheels, allowing people to access the various products and services that are built on that network. For instance, the most famous blockchain ecosystem is Ethereum, and to use a decentralized application built on that network you’ll need to hold some ETH, as that’s the primary token used to pay the “gas fees” required to transact with any Ethereum-based dApp. This is why the quality of the goods and services within a blockchain ecosystem has a direct impact on the asset’s value. The better those products and services are, the more people want to use them, and that means stacking up on those native assets. Those crypto assets are scarce, and so a broad ecosystem with tons of high-quality services is sure to help drive their price up. In other words, if you’re looking for a good token as an investment, it’s essential to consider the broader ecosystem around that asset and understand what value it actually provides. That means exploring the various protocols and dApps within that ecosystem to see what they have to offer, how unique they are, and whether or not they’re likely to grow. The best developers understand this and focus on building out novel ecosystems that can offer something that other networks don’t, and that has led to an explosion of decentralized networks all doing their own thing. An Evolving Ecosystem Take a look at Gleec , one of the oldest blockchain ecosystems around. It began life in 2015 as a network for secure communications, and that’s still a major focus of the project through Gleec Chat, which provides a secure, blockchain-based platform for encrypted messages. Having embraced blockchain in 2017 and created a native token, GLEEC, that same year, Gleec has since launched numerous initiatives that aim to increase the utility of its native asset. Looking to build up an ecosystem that functioned around its communications platform and the GLEEC token, it first created Gllec Wallet. This later morphed to become the Gleec BTC Exchange, which makes the asset accessible to a global audience. It has since added a global payments infrastructure with services such as Gleec Pay, which enables businesses to accept crypto payments, and Gleec Card, which makes it possible for crypto holders to spend their tokens at any store that accepts Visa cards. The company was notably one of the first to seize on the opportunity created by El Salvador’s decision to legalize Bitcoin, securing a license to convert Bitcoin payments into U.S. dollars at any store via the Gleec BTC Exchange. Gleec also dabbled in play-to-earn games with Gleec Racing, a blockchain-based game that was created in collaboration with the Buggyra racing team. It was a comprehensive, adrenaline-fueled racing simulator where players could deposit GLEEC to compete in weekly Grand Prix races, with the winners taking home a significant prize pot paid out in GLEEC. Diversity is a key theme for Gleec, and its latest initiative has seen it venture into the world of tokenized art with Raphael Coin , or the RAPH token. It’s a novel digital asset that represents a share of the recently rediscovered Rafaello masterpiece “Recto: Study for the Battle of the Milvian Bridge”. By purchasing RAPH tokens with GLEEC, users can become fractional owners of the authenticated artwork through Gleec’s transparent blockchain infrastructure, helping to preserve a cultural masterpiece for future generations. Enhancing Utility & Value Gleec’s strategy of exploring different use cases and applications makes a lot of sense, and has had a dramatic effect on the platform’s adoption. Previously, with its laser-focus on building a secure communications platform, it could only attract a very limited audience – and it was also competing in a very tough industry, with heavyweights like WhatsApp also offering encryption. By expanding its horizons, it appeals to far more than just techno-geeks interested in encrypting their communications, with art enthusiasts becoming its newest target demographic. And now it’s taking that even further, once again reaching out to racing enthusiasts with its sponsorship of the Emirati rally car driver Aliyyah Koloc . Such initiatives showcase the flexibility of Gleec’s regulated blockchain infrastructure and allow it to attract a much wider audience. With its growing ecosystem, Gleec offers a wide range of very useful services, enabling people to actually spend their crypto, use it to play games and invest. Such a strategy has also increased the visibility of Gleec, helping it to target new markets like El Salvador and grow its user base. Having a broad blockchain ecosystem fosters more innovation, with insights from one area being applied to other projects building on the same infrastructure. It also ensures more efficient utilization of blockchain resources, supporting multiple applications and services. Meanwhile, Gleec’s regulatory-compliant infrastructure becomes more adaptable and versatile, making it easier to embrace new use cases for blockchain technology as they arise. As Gleec’s ecosystem expands, it creates positive network effects that benefit every participant, with increased transaction volume for the GLEEC token meaning more liquidity and enhanced value for token holders. By evolving from secure communications into a comprehensive payments infrastructure and an experimental platform for art tokenization, Gleec has transformed GLEEC’s utility and created greater value for token holders. It culminates in more positive network effects that benefit every participant, creating much brighter prospects for the blockchain’s future.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/why-gleec-transitioned-from-secure-communications-to-payments-tokenized-art/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|TRADING","Information",cryptocompare

In a post on the social media platform X, Ardoino responds to Artemis CEO Jon Ma, who estimates that Tether as a company is valued at around $515 billion. According to Ma, Tether would be the 19th-largest company in the world if it went public today, making it bigger than Costco and Coca-Cola. Says Ardoino, “Tether valuation at $515 billion is a beautiful number. Maybe a bit bearish considering our current (and increasing) Bitcoin + Gold treasury, yet I’m very humbled. Also truly excited for the next phase of growth of our company.” But the CEO says that Tether has “no need to go public” – even in the wake of the overwhelming success of the initial public offering (IPO) of Circle, the second-largest stablecoin issuer. Last week, the firm behind USDC launched as a publicly-traded company, debuting on the New York Stock Exchange with an opening price of $69 per share, up by 122% from the IPO price of $31.00 per share. CRCL continued to rally to above $123, nearly a 300% gain from the IPO price in just two trading days.

2025-06-09T14:30:15,"Bitcoin Weekly Chart Flexes Strength—Is The Moonshot Just Getting Started?","Bitcoin is making waves once again, flashing strength on the weekly chart as it closes well above key moving averages. With momentum indicators still favoring the bulls and no signs of exhaustion in sight, the current setup hints that the rally might be far from over. Could this be the beginning of an even bigger breakout? Bitcoin Stays Elevated: Bulls Show No Signs of Fatigue In a recent update shared on X, Shaco AI highlighted Bitcoin’s continued bullish momentum, pointing to strong weekly performance on the BTC/USDT chart. The analyst noted that BTC has “ballooned past recent expectations,” closing the week at an impressive $105,700. Related Reading: Bitcoin At A Crossroads: $97,000 Cost Basis Holds Key To Next Breakout This places the asset well above its 25-week Simple Moving Average (SMA) of $95,009.55 and the 50-week SMA at $83,318.12, an encouraging technical signal that suggests Bitcoin’s uptrend remains firmly intact. As Shaco AI put it, “The party isn’t over yet,” hinting that bullish sentiment could carry BTC even higher. Technical indicators further support this upbeat outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently reads 63.51, indicating that buying momentum remains robust without entering overbought territory. This suggests that traders are still comfortable accumulating at current levels, and the market hasn’t yet reached a point of exhaustion. Furthermore, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) remains firmly in positive territory at 5835.33. The MACD’s positioning reflects steady buyer interest and a favorable trend structure, both of which are crucial for sustaining an upward move. Volume Slackens While Price Nears Critical Resistance Zone The analyst went on to point out that despite the bullish setup currently seen on Bitcoin’s chart, the enthusiasm might be tempered by softening trading volume. Specifically, trading volume has only reached 95,302, significantly lower than the average volume of 179,421. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Slips Again, Triggering Fresh Fears of a Deeper Correction This discrepancy signals a noticeable dip in market participation, raising the question of whether the ongoing price rally has enough fuel to sustain its momentum in the short term. As the analyst emphasized, this drop in volume is worth watching closely since it may influence the momentum of next week’s price action. Looking at the broader picture, Bitcoin is approaching a major resistance level at $111,980. This key barrier represents a potential turning point; either it gets broken and paves the way for further upside, or it holds and prompts a short-term correction. Should a pullback occur, the analyst noted that BTC appears to have a comfortable support zone at $49,000, which could act as a solid cushion. In any case, the analyst suggests keeping a close eye on how these technical levels play out, as they could dictate Bitcoin’s next big move.

2025-06-09T14:22:51,"The End of Bitcoin Maximalism","The launch of Bitcoin in 2009 created a resilient and decentralized monetary asset. Early adherents rallied around it as a singular innovation — immutable, fixed-supply, and leaderless. Over time, this coalesced into a belief system: Bitcoin maximalism. The argument was simple. Bitcoin came first. It had the most Proof-of-Work security. The most conservative monetary policy. All other assets were distractions or regressions. But that framing increasingly diverges from how Bitcoin is now being applied in practice. Interoperability Becomes the New Norm Today, the crypto ecosystem is no longer a collection of isolated silos or, at least, it needn’t be. Interoperability is the backbone of Web3. The same technologies that maximalists once dismissed, like wrapped bitcoin and cross-chain bridges, are now exposing the limitations of that worldview. While these technologies are far from perfect, they prove that users want more than ideological purity; they want utility and functionality. This evolution is particularly significant for Bitcoin, which has historically been limited by its transaction speeds and a lack of smart contract functionality. The watershed moment came with the emergence and explosive growth of DeFi, offering yield farming, lending, and trading opportunities that Bitcoin — at least in its native form — couldn’t directly participate in (most early DeFi activity was concentrated on Ethereum). To bridge this gap, solutions like wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) were conceived and launched, tokenizing BTC for use on Ethereum and other chains. While this was a step forward, wrapped tokens came with associated risks, such as centralized custodians, potential security vulnerabilities and an overall departure from Bitcoin’s trustless ethos. New systems, including trust-minimized tunneling and Bitcoin-anchored consensus proofs, are enabling BTC to be integrated into smart contract environments without compromising its core properties. These architectures avoid the need for wrapping. Instead, they treat Bitcoin as a foundational, external settlement layer that can interact directly with the rest of the blockchain ecosystem — through tunneling and specialized Bitcoin-aware virtual machines. The result is simple: Bitcoin is no longer isolated. And it no longer needs to be. Maximalism vs. Infrastructure Bitcoin maximalism asserts that BTC alone is sufficient. But the infrastructure now being deployed across the ecosystem proves otherwise. BTC is being used in DeFi. BTC is supporting NFT standards. BTC is moving across chains. And it is doing so without compromising its consensus layer or monetary properties. The future of crypto belongs to collaboration, not isolation. Blockchain infrastructure will be shaped by interoperability and modular design. Bitcoin need not compete for dominance in such an ecosystem; rather, it can complement and secure a broader multi-chain ecosystem. As developers build bridges between chains rather than walls, they prove that Bitcoin can coexist with other networks, enhancing its utility instead of competing for dominance. In this environment, the maximalist mentality of “one coin to rule them all” already feels out of touch. Regular crypto users want flexibility and different options to stake, lend, or trade their assets across multiple platforms, which interoperability enables — unlike Bitcoin maximalism that restricts all out-of-the-box use cases. As multi-chain ecosystems mature, users are increasingly drawn to infrastructure that supports cross-chain utility, including secure integrations of BTC. Finally, Bitcoin maximalism has always been rooted mostly in ideology — but the crypto industry is driven by innovation, and new technologies are proving that BTC can evolve without losing its importance or advantages. This way, maximalists risk being left behind if they dismiss these advancements as mere “distractions.” The Core of A Multi-Chain Stack Bitcoin continues to serve as the most secure and censorship-resistant settlement network in the world. That is not changing. What is changing is the environment around it. Decentralized systems are growing more interoperable. The expectation that networks will remain isolated is no longer viable. BTC is becoming a core layer in a multi-chain stack, and more integrated into systems it once stood apart from. Where once Bitcoin maximalism offered clarity during crypto’s early phases of growth, the ecosystem has evolved. Today, Bitcoin can serve as a cornerstone in a broader system emphasizing security, interconnectivity, and composability. As this trend continues to gain momentum, Bitcoin maximalism may fade because the idea that one coin must dominate all others ignores the power of collaboration and innovation. Interoperability isn’t a threat to Bitcoin — it’s a catalyst for growth. The future of crypto isn’t about choosing a single winner but rather about building a decentralized world where every chain, including Bitcoin, plays a vital role. The decentralized future will rely on systems that are secure, interoperable, and modular. Bitcoin’s role as a resilient base layer ensures that it will persist as an integral component of that future, not as the only chain, but a fundamental cornerstone among others.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/06/09/the-end-of-bitcoin-maximalism,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|TRADING","Opinion|Opinion",cryptocompare

However, after the waters between Trump and Musk calmed down, BTC held on to the $105,000 level and is consolidating within a certain range. Despite the tension, while expectations for an increase continue, analysts said that Bitcoin is holding on at a certain level but is structurally unstable and fragile. HashKey Eco Labs CEO Kay Lu said that BTC is currently trading in a sensitive area with significant support. Lu noted that all it takes is one bearish news event for Bitcoin to suddenly crash and trigger panic selling. Dominick John, an analyst at crypto trading firm Kronos Research, also noted that the market remains in a wait-and-see mood. Noting that the Crypto Fear and Greed Index is at 55, John added that a macro trigger event or a possible uptrend needs to be confirmed for the rise. At this point, he said that the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI), which are scheduled to be published this week, will determine the near-term direction of Bitcoin and altcoins. Finally, Presto Research Analyst Min Jung also said that the short-term volatility of Bitcoin and altcoins will be shaped depending on macroeconomic developments in the coming period. “We could see increased volatility in the middle of the week… Any upside surprises in both CPI and PPI calendar and inflation data could impact risk assets in general, including crypto.” *This is not investment advice.

Accordingly, van de Poppe argued on June 9, that is only a matter of time until we see a new all-time high for SUI. “SUI remains to be one of the core pillars of the upcoming bull cycle… It’s a matter of time until this one continues to rally towards a new ATH.” — Michaël van de Poppe. Michaël van de Poppe’s SUI prediction. Source: X As per CoinMarketCap, SUI now ranks as the 9th highest blockchain by total value locked (TVL). Suilend, a decentralized lending protocol built on Sui, has also seen no less than a 90% increase in TVL over the past month, locking in a total of $700 million. Likewise, Bitcoin ( BTC )-related assets now account for over 10% of SUI’s TVL, while multiple financial institutions have filed for a SUI-based exchange-traded fund ( ETF ). SUI performance While a significant portion of Sui’s growth is due to BTC-pegged assets and protocols like Babylon and Lombard, the network also boasts over $1.1 billion in circulating stablecoins. The relative strength indicator ( RSI ) remains neutral at 44. Moreover, its weighted funding rate has remained positive for nine consecutive days, and the SUI token is breaking out of a long wedge pattern. Both these facts indicate a consistent bullish trend. Even more notably, SUI has recently shown a golden cross pattern . That is, its short-term (50-day) moving average crosses above the longer-term (200-day) moving average. This pattern is widely regarded as an early indicator of a sustained uptrend. In 2024, it preceded SUI’s 380% rally. However, traders should remain cautious. Regulatory uncertainty around the delayed SUI ETF approval, for example, remains a near-term risk. What’s more, the golden cross pattern is not an infallible benchmark.

2025-06-09T14:11:38,"Is Bitcoin a Better Buy Now Than it Was at $20K? (Lawyer Explains)","TL;DR Bitcoin at its current value is seen by some as a “safer buy” than at $20,000, supported by expectations of rising debt from new economic policies and accelerating institutional and nation-state adoption. Factors like negative exchange netflows, a stable MVRV ratio, and a record 55 million BTC holders point to potential for further price growth. Is BTC Now a ‘Safer Buy?’ John Deaton, an American attorney who represents thousands of XRP investors in the lawsuit between Ripple and the US SEC, recently expressed an interesting opinion regarding the primary cryptocurrency. He shared a post by David Bailey (Chairman of Bitcoin Magazine), who recently urged people to “get as much capital” and use it to purchase Bitcoin (BTC). While Deaton said he is not in favor of telling individuals to take out loans to buy crypto, he argued that the leading digital asset at a price of $106,000 seems like a “safer buy” than it was at $20,000. He backed his theory with the likely passage of the Build Back Better (BBB) economic initiative and the GENIUS Act, predicting they would lead to the printing of fiat money and “skyrocketing” debt. The lawyer added that this possible development, combined with rapid institutional and nation-state adoption, makes buying BTC at current prices “more asymmetrical” than it was at $25,000. “But I’ll fully admit I suffer from both confirmation and wealth-preservation bias,” Deaton concluded. Further Pump Incoming? BTC trading above the psychological level of $100,000 might still seem surreal to some members of the crypto community, who have been waiting for that milestone for years. Moreover, some key factors suggest that the asset may experience an additional rally in the short term. For instance, the BTC exchange netflow has been predominantly negative in the past months, suggesting that investors have shifted from centralized exchanged toward self-custody methods. This , in turn, reduces the immediate selling pressure. BTC Exchange Netflow, Source: CryptoQuant Bitcoin’s MVRV, which compares the asset’s market capitalization to its realized capitalization and helps traders identify whether the asset is undervalued or overvalued, is also worth observing. Over the past few weeks, the ratio has been fluctuating within the healthy range of 2 to 2.5, suggesting there is still potential for further appreciation. According to CryptoQuant, historical data shows that readings above 3.70 have typically signaled market peaks, whereas values below 1 have indicated bottoms. BTC MVRV, Source: CryptoQuant Last but not least, the total number of BTC holders recently hit a new all-time high of over 55 million, signaling growing adoption and higher demand for the asset.

2025-06-09T14:10:32,"New Crypto Coins Analysis: Bitcoin Solaris Mobile Mining App Allows Anyone to Mine from Their Phone, Unlike Bitcoin’s $15,000 Equipment","The post New Crypto Coins Analysis: Bitcoin Solaris Mobile Mining App Allows Anyone to Mine from Their Phone, Unlike Bitcoin’s $15,000 Equipment appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News For years, Bitcoin mining has been a game for the wealthy. As ASIC machines skyrocketed in price, the average person was locked out of the rewards. Today, a competitive Bitcoin mining setup can cost $15,000 or more—just for the hardware. But in 2025, a quiet revolution is underway. Enter Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S): a next-generation blockchain that allows anyone to participate in mining using a device they already own—thanks to the upcoming release of its mobile-first mining experience. And this isn’t just a minor innovation. It could completely reshape how wealth is distributed in crypto—removing the barriers that Bitcoin’s infrastructure never solved. Bitcoin Set the Standard—But Only for the Few Bitcoin created the blueprint for digital wealth. But over time, it became increasingly centralized. Mining power was consumed by massive farms in energy-rich regions. Hardware became harder to access, louder, hotter, and more expensive. That’s why Bitcoin’s system, while still effective, has become a gated playground for the ultra-prepared. Bitcoin Solaris changes the rules. It brings mining back to the people—without compromising on security, decentralization, or profitability. Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Solaris: The Mining Gap Feature Bitcoin Bitcoin Solaris Mining Access ASIC-only, ~$15K hardware Desktop, browser, mobile-ready Consensus Proof-of-Work PoW (Base) + DPoS (Solaris Layer) Energy Consumption Very high 99.95% lower Smart Contract Support None Rust-based, fully audited Validator Rotation Not applicable Every 24 hours Entry Barrier High Minimal The Architecture That Makes It All Work At the core of Bitcoin Solaris is a dual-layer consensus design that solves the blockchain trilemma—speed, security, and decentralization—in a single structure. Proof-of-Work Base Layer: Runs on SHA-256, making it compatible with traditional Bitcoin mining gear Delegated Proof-of-Stake Solaris Layer: 21 validators elected by stakers, rotating every 24 hours Block Time: 15 seconds on the Solaris Layer, with finality in 2 seconds Scalability: Supports over 100,000 transactions per second Energy Efficiency: Uses 99.95% less energy than Bitcoin while maintaining PoW integrity Crypto Mining Just Got Simpler, Smarter, and Mobile—Join BTC-S This setup ensures that mobile users can securely contribute to the network without needing industrial-grade tools. Technical Proof and Audit-Backed Confidence One of the most important differentiators for Bitcoin Solaris is its credibility. Its smart contracts have been independently audited by Cyberscope and Freshcoins , and passed with flying colors. These audits covered everything from block finality mechanisms to staking logic and validator incentives—ensuring the network is ready for real-world scale and enterprise-grade reliability. The Presale Is Heating Up Fast Bitcoin Solaris is now in Phase 7 of its limited-time presale , with the token currently priced at $7. The next phase will raise the price to $8, and a $20 launch price is confirmed. Investors are moving quickly, drawn in by: More than $3.8 million already raised Over 11,000 unique users onboarded Less than 8 weeks left before the presale ends One of the shortest and most explosive crypto launches of the year Unlike Bitcoin, which was mined before most people even knew what it was, Bitcoin Solaris is being adopted in real time—before the full release. How Bitcoin Solaris Is Creating a New Class of Wealth Builders The biggest opportunity in crypto is early participation. But until now, early access meant complex staking, expensive rigs, or deep technical knowledge. Bitcoin Solaris simplifies everything. You can mine or stake using a standard device Validators rotate, giving smaller users real opportunity Block rewards go to contributors—not just large-scale farms Network mechanics reward time-weighted engagement and active participation It’s not about hype. It’s about utility. As 2Bit Crypto noted in a recent video , Bitcoin Solaris is built to generate wealth for those who plug in—not just those who hold. The Road Ahead: What’s Next for BTC-S Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just a whitepaper—it’s a working ecosystem with a defined roadmap and a team hitting milestone after milestone. Here’s a quick summary of what’s happening: Q2–Q4 2025: Token launched, presale opens, protocol development underway Q1 2026: Testnet launches, validator tools and wallets released, bridge to Solana finalized Q2 2026: Mainnet deployment prep and developer ecosystem opens Q3 2026 and beyond: Mainnet live, DEX launches, Fortune 500 partnerships in progress Every step brings more infrastructure online—and pushes Bitcoin Solaris closer to its vision of universal, accessible blockchain power. Crypto Isn’t Just for Whales Anymore Bitcoin was revolutionary—but it required heavy upfront investment to benefit. Bitcoin Solaris takes that foundation and rewires it for accessibility. With the ability to mine and earn from your browser, laptop, or phone, this blockchain is giving everyday users the tools they were previously denied. It’s fast. It’s fair. And it’s only just getting started.

2025-06-09T14:10:28,"Coinbase Lawsuit: BiT Global Abruptly Ends wBTC Delisting Legal Battle","BitcoinWorld Coinbase Lawsuit: BiT Global Abruptly Ends wBTC Delisting Legal Battle In a rather unexpected turn of events within the often-contentious world of cryptocurrency legal battles, a significant Coinbase lawsuit has come to an abrupt end. BiT Global, a crypto exchange with ties to TRON founder Justin Sun, has decided to drop its legal action against the major U.S. exchange, Coinbase. What Was the Coinbase Lawsuit All About? The now-dropped legal challenge stemmed from Coinbase’s decision to delist Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC). BiT Global initially filed the lawsuit in December, taking issue with Coinbase’s move regarding the popular token. While the specifics of BiT Global’s original complaint weren’t extensively detailed in the initial reports, lawsuits of this nature often revolve around claims of improper procedure, lack of sufficient notice, or potential damages incurred by the delisting party due to the exchange’s action. Delisting can impact liquidity, trading volume, and the perceived legitimacy of an asset, which could potentially affect businesses that hold or facilitate trading of that asset. The filing of the suit itself highlighted the increasing frequency of legal disputes within the crypto industry as platforms and protocols navigate complex relationships and operational decisions in a largely unregulated or newly regulated landscape. Who is BiT Global and Why Does it Matter? BiT Global is a cryptocurrency exchange based in Hong Kong. Its significance in this context is largely amplified by its prominent backing: none other than Justin Sun, the well-known founder of the TRON blockchain and a figure often involved in various crypto ventures and public discussions. Sun’s involvement often brings additional attention to projects and disputes. As a vocal and active participant in the crypto space, his backing of BiT Global meant this particular lawsuit against a major player like Coinbase garnered notable interest from the community and industry observers. It wasn’t just a dispute between two exchanges; it involved a personality with significant influence. Understanding wBTC Delisting and Its Impact To grasp why a wBTC delisting would trigger a lawsuit, it’s important to understand what wBTC is. Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) is an ERC-20 token that represents Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain. It’s designed to bring Bitcoin’s liquidity and value into the Ethereum ecosystem, allowing it to be used in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications like lending, borrowing, and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Key points about wBTC: It’s backed 1:1 by Bitcoin held in custody. It enables BTC holders to participate in Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem. Merchants (like custodians and exchanges) mint and burn wBTC. When a major exchange like Coinbase decides to delist an asset, even one as significant as wBTC (in terms of its underlying value), it can have several consequences: Reduced Liquidity: Traders on that specific platform lose the ability to easily buy or sell the asset. Price Impact: Delisting can sometimes lead to price volatility or a drop on other platforms if users rush to sell. Accessibility Issues: Users holding the asset on the delisting exchange must transfer it elsewhere, potentially incurring fees or facing inconvenience. Signal to Market: While wBTC’s core function remains, a delisting by a major player might be interpreted in various ways by the market, though given wBTC’s nature, a single exchange delisting is less impactful than for a smaller altcoin. For a business like BiT Global, which operates as an exchange itself, a delisting on a platform like Coinbase could potentially affect their users who interact with wBTC or create ripple effects in the broader market that impact their operations or holdings. The Abrupt End: Why Drop the Crypto Lawsuit ? The decision by BiT Global to drop the crypto lawsuit against Coinbase is perhaps the most intriguing part of this story. Lawsuits, especially between significant entities, are often lengthy, costly, and complex affairs. Dropping a suit after filing typically suggests one of several possibilities: Settlement: The parties may have reached an out-of-court settlement. The terms of such settlements are usually confidential, but it would involve some form of agreement or compensation resolving the dispute. Lack of Strong Case: BiT Global’s legal team may have reviewed the case further and determined that their claims were unlikely to succeed in court. Continuing would be a waste of resources. Strategic Decision: The lawsuit may have served its purpose (e.g., drawing attention to the issue, opening a channel for negotiation), and continuing the legal battle was no longer strategically beneficial for BiT Global or Justin Sun. Cost Considerations: Litigation is expensive. The potential costs of pursuing the lawsuit through trial may have outweighed the potential benefits or recovery. Without official statements from either party regarding the reason for dropping the suit, the exact cause remains speculative. However, the swiftness with which the suit was dropped (filed in December, dropped relatively soon after) might suggest an early settlement or a rapid strategic reassessment. The Role of Justin Sun in the Legal Landscape Justin Sun is no stranger to legal or regulatory attention. His various projects, including TRON and the stablecoin USDD, have sometimes been the subject of scrutiny or legal challenges. His involvement in this BiT Global case adds another layer to his public profile as a figure actively navigating the complex and sometimes fraught legal environment surrounding cryptocurrency. While he was not the direct plaintiff (BiT Global was), his backing of the exchange makes him an influential figure behind the scenes of this particular legal skirmish. The decision to drop the suit would almost certainly have had his involvement or approval. What Does This Mean Going Forward? For Coinbase, the dropping of the suit means one less legal challenge to contend with. While they face various regulatory and legal pressures, the resolution of this specific dispute allows them to focus on other operational and legal matters. For BiT Global and Justin Sun, it signifies the end of a particular legal strategy related to the wBTC delisting. It doesn’t necessarily indicate a change in their stance on the importance of asset accessibility but rather the conclusion of this specific approach to address the issue. More broadly, this incident serves as a reminder of the dynamic and often unpredictable legal landscape in the crypto industry. Exchanges’ listing and delisting decisions can have real-world consequences and sometimes lead to legal challenges, though these challenges don’t always proceed to a full trial. Conclusion The Coinbase lawsuit initiated by BiT Global over the wBTC delisting has concluded with BiT Global dropping its claims. This decision, likely influenced by factors ranging from potential settlement talks to strategic considerations or legal assessments, brings a swift end to a legal battle that highlighted the complexities faced by crypto exchanges and related businesses. While the exact reasons remain private, the outcome avoids a potentially protracted and costly legal fight for both parties, adding another notable chapter to the evolving history of crypto lawsuit cases involving major industry figures like Justin Sun .

2025-06-09T14:00:54,"Bitcoin Treasury Boost: The Blockchain Group Secures Strategic €300M ATM Deal","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasury Boost: The Blockchain Group Secures Strategic €300M ATM Deal In a significant move underscoring the growing trend of companies integrating digital assets into their financial strategies, The Blockchain Group, a prominent French blockchain technology company, has announced a substantial financial agreement aimed at bolstering its Bitcoin reserves. This development is particularly noteworthy as it involves a considerable sum and a specialized funding mechanism. Who is The Blockchain Group and Why This Deal Matters? The Blockchain Group operates in the dynamic blockchain sector, focusing on various applications of distributed ledger technology. For any company in a rapidly evolving market, securing flexible and substantial funding is crucial for growth and strategic initiatives. This €300 million ($342.78 million) agreement represents a major financial injection that signals strong intent regarding their balance sheet strategy. The deal, formalized through an At The Market (ATM) capital increase agreement with asset manager TOBAM, is designed specifically to support the company’s strategic decision to increase its holdings of Bitcoin (BTC). By doing so, The Blockchain Group aims to enhance its Bitcoin treasury strategy, effectively increasing the amount of BTC held per share. Understanding the ATM Capital Increase Mechanism An ATM capital increase is a type of public offering where a company can sell newly issued shares into the existing market over a period of time at prevailing market prices. Unlike traditional underwritten offerings where shares are sold at a fixed price to a group of investors, an ATM offering provides companies with flexibility and control over the timing and volume of shares sold. Here’s a simple breakdown of how an ATM works: Flexibility: The company can choose when and how many shares to sell, reacting to market conditions. Efficiency: It can be a cost-effective way to raise capital compared to other methods. Market Price: Shares are sold at or near the current market price, avoiding the need for a large discount often required in traditional offerings. Gradual Funding: Capital is raised incrementally over time rather than in one lump sum. For The Blockchain Group , this €300 million ATM agreement allows them to raise funds gradually by selling shares, with the explicit purpose of using the proceeds to acquire Bitcoin for their Bitcoin treasury. This method provides the company with the means to accumulate BTC strategically over a period, potentially mitigating the impact of short-term price volatility compared to a single large purchase. The Strategic Shift: Building a Bitcoin Treasury The concept of a Bitcoin treasury involves a corporation holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet as a reserve asset, similar to how companies have historically held cash, gold, or other traditional assets. This strategy gained significant traction in recent years, popularized by companies like MicroStrategy. Companies adopting a Bitcoin treasury strategy often cite several key reasons: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply is seen by many as protection against the devaluation of fiat currencies due to inflation. Store of Value: It is viewed as a digital form of gold, capable of preserving value over the long term. Potential Appreciation: Companies anticipate that the value of Bitcoin will increase over time, boosting their balance sheet strength. Attracting Talent/Investors: Holding Bitcoin can appeal to a growing segment of employees and investors who are bullish on digital assets. By increasing its Bitcoin treasury, The Blockchain Group is positioning itself within this forward-thinking corporate trend, signaling confidence in Bitcoin as a long-term asset and potentially offering its shareholders exposure to BTC’s performance. Broader Implications for Corporate Bitcoin Adoption This €300 million ATM deal is not just significant for The Blockchain Group ; it also contributes to the broader narrative of corporate Bitcoin adoption. When publicly traded companies utilize sophisticated financial instruments like ATM offerings specifically to fund Bitcoin acquisitions, it lends further legitimacy to Bitcoin as a viable corporate asset. While pioneers like MicroStrategy aggressively converted large portions of their cash reserves into Bitcoin, other companies have taken more measured approaches. Deals like this one by The Blockchain Group demonstrate alternative, flexible methods companies can employ to build their Bitcoin treasury over time, using equity financing rather than solely relying on existing cash reserves. However, the path of holding corporate Bitcoin is not without its challenges. Companies must navigate accounting complexities, regulatory uncertainties, and, perhaps most significantly, the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. A sudden downturn in Bitcoin’s price can negatively impact a company’s balance sheet and stock price, as seen with some early adopters. What This Means for Crypto Investment and the Market From the perspective of crypto investment , this deal is a positive signal. A €300 million commitment, even if deployed over time, represents substantial institutional demand for Bitcoin. Such large-scale corporate buying can contribute to price stability and growth by reducing the available supply on exchanges. For investors interested in gaining exposure to Bitcoin through traditional equity markets, companies like The Blockchain Group that hold significant BTC on their balance sheets can become attractive options. The value of their shares may, to some extent, become correlated with the performance of Bitcoin itself, offering a different avenue for crypto investment. The involvement of TOBAM, an asset manager, in facilitating this ATM agreement also highlights the increasing comfort level of traditional financial institutions in participating in deals related to digital assets. This collaboration between a blockchain company, an asset manager, and the public markets via an ATM offering showcases the evolving landscape of corporate finance intersecting with the world of crypto investment. Benefits of the Deal Funding for Strategic Asset Acquisition: Provides substantial capital specifically earmarked for increasing Bitcoin holdings. Flexibility in Execution: ATM structure allows for opportunistic buying based on market conditions. Potential Balance Sheet Enhancement: Successful Bitcoin treasury strategy can increase asset value. Shareholder Alignment: Appeals to shareholders bullish on Bitcoin and digital assets. Potential Challenges and Risks Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price fluctuations directly impact the value of the treasury holdings. Share Dilution: Selling new shares via the ATM can dilute the ownership stake of existing shareholders. Execution Risk: Successfully deploying €300M into BTC requires careful market timing and execution. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for corporate crypto holdings is still evolving. Conclusion The Blockchain Group ‘s €300 million ATM agreement with TOBAM marks a significant milestone in its strategic development and the broader trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption. By leveraging this flexible funding mechanism, the company is positioning itself to substantially increase its Bitcoin treasury, signaling strong conviction in the digital asset’s long-term value. While challenges related to market volatility and potential dilution exist, this move underscores the increasing integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional corporate finance and represents a notable crypto investment strategy by a publicly listed company. This deal serves as a compelling example of how companies are finding innovative ways to incorporate Bitcoin into their financial architecture, potentially paving the way for further corporate adoption in the future.

2025-06-09T13:50:07,"Bitcoin on Exchanges Hits 7-Year Low, Supply Shock Looms","Per Glassnode data, BTC on exchanges dropped below the 11% mark, a scenario last seen in March 2018. This significant decline to approximately 2.3 million BTC reflects a shift in investor behavior and market structure, with implications for Bitcoin's liquidity and price dynamics Why is a Hodling Trend Skyrocketing in the Bitcoin Ecosystem? Coins leaving exchanges in droves is deemed bullish because they are held for future purposes other than speculation. As a result, selling pressure decreases because cryptocurrencies are usually kept in exchanges for liquidation purposes. Since this trend is playing out in the BTC network with exchange balances being at a 7-year low, more holders are moving their coins to digital wallets and cold storage, showing long-term confidence. CryptoQuant data also shares similar insights that Bitcoin’s hodl level has hit a 2-year high, according to the Bitcoin exchange flows to network activity ratio. This measure, also known as the Fund Flow Ratio, is a key on-chain metric that measures the proportion of Bitcoin moving through exchanges relative to the total transaction volume on the network. It's calculated by dividing the total exchange inflows and outflows by the total amount of Bitcoin transferred across the entire network. One primary factor contributing to exchange balance dropping is the migration of Bitcoin holdings from exchanges to institutional custodians, particularly following the approval of Bitcoin Spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January 2024. Major asset managers, including BlackRock and Fidelity, have accumulated substantial Bitcoin reserves for their ETF products, often utilizing custodians like Coinbase. This movement has led to a reclassification of holdings, where assets previously counted as exchange balances are now under institutional custody. Banking giant JP Morgan recently revealed that it could accept Bitcoin ETF shares for loans , in the process, unlocking new credit lines. Delving Deeper into Bitcoin’s Supply Shock Scenario A supply shock occurs when the availability of an asset diminishes while demand remains steady or increases, often leading to a price surge. In Bitcoin's case, several converging factors have the potential of creating a notable supply shock: 1. Post-Halving Scarcity and ETFs Bitcoin's protocol includes a halving event approximately every four years, reducing the reward miners receive for adding new blocks to the blockchain. The most recent halving in April 2024 decreased the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC, effectively halving the rate at which new bitcoins enter circulation. This reduction tightens supply, especially as demand continues to grow. The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs has provided institutional investors with a regulated avenue to gain exposure to Bitcoin. 2. Corporate Treasury Adoption An increasing number of companies are incorporating Bitcoin into their corporate treasuries as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. As of June 2025, 80 firms collectively own around 3.4% of the total Bitcoin supply. Notable examples include MicroStrategy, which holds approximately 580,000 BTC, and GameStop, which recently invested $500 million into Bitcoin. South Korean entertainment conglomerate K Wave Media recently revealed plans to roll out a $500 million Bitcoin treasury strategy with the aim of expanding its K-pop related business, including music distribution and concert management. 3. Macroeconomic Tailwinds Global macroeconomic factors are also contributing to Bitcoin's bullish outlook. The U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policies have led to an expected 18% increase in the global M2 money supply in 2025, from $107 trillion to over $127 trillion. This monetary expansion, coupled with a weakening U.S. dollar, enhances Bitcoin's appeal as a store of value. Conclusion The decline in exchange-held Bitcoin reduces the immediate supply available for trading, potentially leading to decreased selling pressure. In economic terms, a lower supply amid steady or increasing demand can exert upward pressure on prices. With BTC reserves on exchanges hitting a 7-year low, it remains to be seen whether a supply shock will jumpstart the apex cryptocurrency to the next level as Bitcoin traverses the $105,216 level.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9497/bitcoin-on-exchanges-hits-7-year-low-supply-shock-looms,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

This move, confirmed on 9 June, has caught the attention of traders and regulators alike, as it continues a trend of high-volume minting by the world’s largest stablecoin issuer. Whale Alert @whale_alert · Follow 💵 💵 💵 💵 💵 💵 💵 💵 💵 💵 1,000,000,000 #USDT (1,000,799,999 USD) minted at Tether Treasury whale-alert.io/transaction/tr… 2:52 PM · Jun 9, 2025 2.8K Reply Copy link Read 141 replies The latest mint represents more than 1% of all USDT currently issued on Tron, where most of Tether’s supply is concentrated. As questions grow about stablecoin transparency and oversight, this issuance adds to the scrutiny facing Tether’s operations and market influence. Tron dominates as USDT supply crosses $76 billion The new $1 billion mint has brought Tether’s total USDT supply on Tron to $76 billion. That surpasses the $63.2 billion in USDT supply on Ethereum, cementing Tron’s status as the leading blockchain for USDT transactions. Overall, Tether’s circulating supply now exceeds 156 billion across chains. The scale of minting on Tron reflects both user preferences and cost considerations. Tron offers cheaper and faster transactions compared to Ethereum, making it a preferred network for stablecoin transfers, particularly for high-frequency traders and centralised exchanges. However, the concentration of such large volumes on a single chain also exposes systemic risks in the event of a disruption. Market timing sparks renewed speculation Tether’s minting pattern has frequently aligned with bullish moves in the broader crypto market. When 2 billion USDT were issued on Tron on 21 May, Bitcoin surged to a record high of $111,000 the following day. As of now, the freshly minted $1 billion has not yet entered circulation, remaining in Tether’s treasury. But the anticipation of deployment has already fuelled discussions about whether this signals another wave of buying activity or market volatility. USDT is often used to move funds into cryptocurrencies quickly, giving traders flexibility during times of high momentum. Still, without clear disclosures from Tether about how and when it injects liquidity, market participants are left to speculate on the implications. Calls for IPO dismissed despite valuation estimates Tether remains privately held, but recent estimates suggest it would rank among the most valuable firms in crypto if it chose to list. Analyst Jon Ma pegged Tether’s hypothetical IPO valuation at $515 billion, a figure that would make it one of the largest public offerings globally. Despite this, CEO Paolo Ardoino has publicly dismissed any plans for an IPO. The company maintains that it does not require external capital or a public listing to sustain its operations. However, remaining private means Tether avoids the level of financial scrutiny required of public companies—an issue that continues to draw criticism from regulators. Tether has long been at the centre of debates around stablecoin reserves and auditing. Although it now releases quarterly assurance reports, critics argue these fall short of the transparency required to fully assess systemic risk. With the US exploring new stablecoin legislation, the pressure on Tether to increase its disclosures may intensify. Regulatory spotlight returns as stablecoin rules loom The latest mint also arrives amid renewed focus from US lawmakers on stablecoin oversight. Draft regulations currently under discussion could impose reserve requirements, transparency standards, and potential restrictions on issuers who do not comply. Given Tether’s dominant position in the market and its limited disclosure compared to rivals like Circle’s USDC, it could face challenges under a stricter regulatory regime. While it continues to maintain that its reserves are fully backed, the absence of third-party audits remains a sticking point. Whether the $1 billion mint is a sign of bullish activity ahead or a strategic liquidity manoeuvre, it once again places Tether in the centre of the stablecoin debate—where questions of trust, scale, and regulation intersect.

Is this a signal the market is bracing for something explosive? Table of Contents Bitcoin price reclaims $107,000 as political jitters fade BTC options data shows strong bullish lean into June expiry BTC breakout gains traction with support from options flows Bitcoin price reclaims $107,000 as political jitters fade Bitcoin ( BTC ) has quietly stabilized after a volatile week in which political headlines briefly disrupted market sentiment. The public dispute between U.S. President Donald Trump and Elon Musk pushed BTC toward the $100,000 mark, raising concerns about short-term confidence. The decline, however, proved temporary. Over the weekend, Bitcoin began to recover, and as of Jun. 9, it is trading around $107,800, up nearly 2% in the past 24 hours. BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news Institutional activity appears to be reinforcing the rebound. A growing list of companies is renewing interest in Bitcoin as a long-term treasury asset, drawing renewed attention to its role beyond trading. MicroStrategy has re-entered the spotlight with a new capital raise. The company is issuing $1 billion in perpetual preferred stock and plans to allocate part of the proceeds toward additional Bitcoin purchases. Metaplanet, which has been gradually building its BTC reserves over the past year, introduced a more ambitious target on Jun. 6. The firm now aims to accumulate 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027, expanding its original goal of 21,000 BTC by a factor of ten. These developments come amid ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment. U.S. inflation data is due this week, beginning with the Consumer Price Index on Wednesday, followed by the Producer Price Index on Thursday. Traders are watching both releases for signals that could influence the Federal Reserve’s next policy move. The CME FedWatch Tool currently shows an over 99% probability that the Fed will maintain interest rates between 4.25% and 4.50% at its Jun. 17 meeting. Against this backdrop, let’s unpack what current BTC options data reveals about momentum and whether traders are preparing for more upside or bracing for a pullback. BTC options data shows strong bullish lean into June expiry The Jun. 27 Bitcoin options expiry on Deribit reflects one of the most tightly concentrated setups in recent months. Bitcoin options (June expiry) | Source: Deribit Total open interest stands at 123,528 contracts, composed of 77,077 calls and 46,451 puts, resulting in a put/call ratio of 0.60. The ratio suggests a continued bullish lean in positioning. The Max Pain level, where the most aggregate losses would be realized across both calls and puts, is located at $100,000. Above that level, bullish positioning becomes more visible. A significant spike in open interest appears at the $120,000 strike, indicating that many traders are eyeing it as a short-term upside target. One of the most notable data points is the surge in call open interest at $300,000. While strikes at $200,000 and $220,000 show some activity, the aggressive positioning at $300,000 stands out. This type of exposure is likely tied to tail-risk hedging or asymmetric upside protection, potentially by institutions or large spot holders. On the downside, the $85,000 strike holds the most concentrated open interest. While some protection is built between $60,000 and $90,000, the volume drops sharply below $85,000. If Bitcoin trades within the $95,000 to $105,000 range as expiry nears, many options buyers on both sides may face decay-related losses. The Jul. 25 expiry offers a more evenly distributed structure. Total open interest is lower at 40,267 contracts, with 25,109 calls and 15,158 puts. The put/call ratio remains at 0.60, indicating a similar bullish inclination, though with a more measured approach. Bitcoin options (July expiry) | Source: Deribit Call open interest is spread across key levels at $120,000, $130,000, $140,000, and $150,000, with relatively even distribution. Unlike the June expiry, there are no outsized bets far beyond current spot prices. The Max Pain for July is positioned at $104,000, slightly higher than June’s $100,000, suggesting a gradual upward shift in pricing expectations. Much of the July call exposure becomes meaningful only above $110,000. Unless BTC breaks through and holds above that level, a large portion of bullish open interest may remain inactive. On the put side, July mirrors much of the structure seen in June. The $85,000 strike continues to act as the key downside hedge, now joined by increased activity at $100,000. Below $70,000, put interest remains minimal, indicating that sharp downside moves are not being actively priced in. Overall, both the June and July expiries suggest a market tilted toward the upside, though with different expressions. June shows more aggressive exposure at the high end, particularly at $120,000 and $300,000, while July reflects a more technical and layered positioning framework. Bearish hedging remains limited in both cases, with $85,000 acting as the key zone of downside defense. The absence of deeper hedging under $70,000 suggests a low probability market view of capitulation. BTC breakout gains traction with support from options flows Bitcoin has reclaimed the $107,000 level, prompting analysts to assess whether the recent move marks the beginning of a broader breakout. The return above this zone is being read as a short-term structural shift following several days of tight, bearish price action. Analyst ali_charts pointed to the breakout above $106,600 and identified immediate upside targets at $108,300 and $110,000. Resistance broke, and #Bitcoin $BTC could reach $108,300 or even $110,000! https://t.co/NJQGfyD5mX pic.twitter.com/oVF0rccXlE — Ali (@ali_charts) June 9, 2025 According to his chart, BTC is currently positioned between the breakout level and the next key resistance area. Sustained movement through this band may allow the price to extend higher without requiring fresh catalysts. Michaël van de Poppe also emphasized the importance of the $106,500 support. In his latest analysis, holding above this area could attract increased interest from short-term traders and pressure short sellers to exit. I mentioned before that I'm looking at $106,500 for #Bitcoin to break. It's happening and it's showing strength. I've added some more context of when I'm expecting to see the acceleration. As long as we start staying above crucial levels, we'll start to see: – More buying… pic.twitter.com/scRtgpbjqJ — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) June 9, 2025 A move toward $108,900, he noted, may trigger faster price acceleration due to reactive trading behavior. These outlooks are supported by recent options data. Open interest in the Jun. 27 expiry remains heavily concentrated at the $120,000 call strike, reflecting a clear bullish bias. If Bitcoin begins closing above $110,000, those positions start gaining delta exposure. Traders, in response, may hedge through spot or perpetual contracts, mechanically contributing to upward price momentum. On the downside, bearish positioning appears limited. The $85,000 strike holds the most meaningful put volume, acting as a key hedge.. Whether BTC can hold above these levels through macro data releases this week will determine whether this setup evolves into a trend or resets into consolidation.

It can also jeopardize the region’s fintech leadership, driving startups and talent abroad. The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) sees 54 nations as a unified market incorporating digital assets. But new rules and regulations in different African countries threaten this vision of unity. Kenya risks more than revenue with new crypto tax With a revised 1.5% crypto transactions tax, the nation risks losing regional fintech leadership, startup businesses overseas, and fracturing Africa’s digital economy, along with undermining its crypto revenue. It also pushes young African crypto users and tech enthusiasts to pursue unregulated platforms and informal channels. Many Kenyans, whose primary income is from trading cryptocurrency, are at risk of losing income. Freelancers who converted crypto into money to pay rent or school fees might lose their income. It also threatens content creators, developers, stakers, validators, and NFT artists who use cryptocurrency assets as daily payment roots. The National Assembly Committee on Finance and National Planning suggests a fourth point path for adequate crypto tax regulation in Kenya. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Tax in India Is Crushing Profits, Here’s How Bitcoin ETFs Can Save You , Key highlights of the National Assembly Committee regarding tax Tax efficiency: Digital assets should be treated under existing property disposal rules to avoid double taxation rather than the customized tax of 1.5%. This also eases the daily utility of crypto assets. Balancing innovation and regulation: Kenya should open itself to blockchain experimentation– from carbon credits to stablecoins. Privacy compliance: Public audits and cryptographic proofs should be integrated to ensure customer privacy. With this approach, the privacy of the investors will not be compromised. Phased rollout: The national assembly committee suggests that Kenya should prioritize education and voluntary compensation. It will assist in building capacity before fully enforced. What’s next? Upcoming bills under consideration Besides crypto tax, Kenya is also considering the Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) Bill 2025. The bill aims to strengthen existing regulations, such as anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT), along with reducing illicit financial flows.

In Kenya, a 1.5% tax is imposed on every crypto transaction, which applies to transfers and exchanges regardless of whether a gain is made. This is a revised rate from an earlier 3%. Is cryptocurrency legal in Kenya? While cryptocurrency is not explicitly banned in Kenya, it is also not recognized as legal tender. The Central Bank of Kenya has historically issued warnings about its risks. However, Kenya is currently moving towards establishing a comprehensive legal and regulatory framework for digital assets, including the Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) Bill 2025.

2025-06-09T13:31:37,"Bitcoin above $100k could spark institutional altcoin rally: MEXC","Wall Street has now set its sights on altcoins, and inflows could follow if Bitcoin holds above a key level, says MEXC COO. Recent crypto IPOs and treasury announcements highlight growing institutional interest in Bitcoin (BTC) . This demand could soon extend to proven, low-volatility altcoins, according to Tracy Jin, COO of MEXC, who spoke with crypto.news. However, such a shift will largely depend on whether Bitcoin maintains strength above a critical threshold. “Capital markets are reopening to digital asset firms with credible models, while financial engineering — like Strategy’s hybrid fixed-income Bitcoin offering — signals a maturing appetite for low-volatility crypto returns. If momentum sustains and BTC holds above key thresholds, a broader institutional rotation into altcoins could follow,” Tracy Jin, MEXC. You might also like: Europe’s first Bitcoin Treasury firm plans to raise $340m to buy more BTC Traditional markets are actively driving crypto: Tracy Jin Jin pointed to several key developments as evidence of rising institutional interest in crypto. One standout example was Circle’s successful IPO . Gemini has also taken similar steps, while companies like Metaplanet are expanding their Bitcoin treasuries, including a planned $1 billion BTC acquisition. “All of these moves together point to a big change: crypto companies are no longer just reacting to market trends; they’re actually influencing how institutions can access crypto. As IPO calendars fill up and more money is being put into crypto through the stock market, it’s becoming a bigger part of traditional finance,” Tracy Jin, MEXC. You might also like: Trump, Musk feud; Circle IPO prices above range, Strategy upsizes offering | Weekly Recap According to Jin, this trend is likely to persist—at least in the near term. The key risk factor remains Bitcoin’s price. If BTC drops below the psychological $100,000 level, a temporary institutional pullback becomes more likely. As long as Bitcoin stays above $100,000 and big investors keep wanting it, more companies will probably go public with it, buy more of it, and get more money flowing into it — and not just into BTC but eventually into the whole altcoin market as well, as more people feel confident about cryptocurrency.

2025-06-09T13:30:11,"BTC Perpetual Futures: Unlocking Crucial Long Short Ratio Insights","BitcoinWorld BTC Perpetual Futures: Unlocking Crucial Long Short Ratio Insights Hey there, crypto traders and enthusiasts! Navigating the often wild waves of the cryptocurrency market, especially when it comes to derivatives like BTC perpetual futures , requires more than just watching price charts. Understanding the underlying market sentiment – who’s betting on the price going up (long) and who’s betting on it going down (short) – is absolutely crucial. That’s where the long short ratio comes into play. This little metric can offer a powerful glimpse into the collective mindset of traders across major exchanges. Are traders feeling bullish and piling into long positions, or is fear creeping in, leading to more short bets? Let’s dive into the latest crypto futures data and see what the 24-hour long-short ratios for BTC perpetual futures are telling us right now. Understanding the Long Short Ratio in Crypto Before we look at the numbers, let’s quickly break down what the long short ratio actually represents. In simple terms, it’s the ratio of the total number of long positions versus the total number of short positions currently open on a specific asset, like Bitcoin (BTC), on a given exchange or across multiple exchanges. A ratio above 1 indicates that there are more long positions than short positions. This suggests a generally bullish sentiment among traders. A ratio below 1 indicates that there are more short positions than long positions. This points towards a more bearish sentiment. A ratio close to 1 (or 50% Long / 50% Short) suggests a relatively neutral or undecided market sentiment. It’s a key indicator that many traders use to gauge the prevailing Bitcoin trading sentiment in the derivatives market. Latest Crypto Futures Data : What Does it Tell Us? Looking at the 24-hour data for BTC perpetual futures across several prominent exchanges, we can see a slight lean towards the long side, but overall, the market appears quite balanced. Here’s a snapshot of the long-short ratios: Exchange/Total Long Positions Short Positions Total (Across Measured Exchanges) 51.07% 48.93% Binance 52.10% 47.90% Bybit 50.01% 49.99% Gate.io 50.52% 49.48% As you can see from this crypto futures data , the total ratio sits just above 51% long. This suggests that, on aggregate over the past day, slightly more traders were positioned for a price increase than a decrease. However, being so close to 50/50 indicates a relatively neutral stance overall, or perhaps a market lacking strong conviction in either direction at this exact moment. Interpreting Bitcoin Trading Sentiment from the Ratio How should we interpret this specific long short ratio data in terms of Bitcoin trading sentiment ? The key takeaway is balance, with a minor bullish tilt. Here are a few points to consider: Slight Long Bias: The fact that longs slightly outweigh shorts suggests a marginal preference for upward price movement among futures traders. Lack of Extreme Conviction: A ratio significantly skewed (e.g., 60%+ long or short) would indicate strong sentiment. The current numbers, being so close to 50/50, suggest the market is somewhat indecisive or waiting for a clearer signal. Exchange Variations: While the total is balanced, Binance shows a slightly stronger long bias compared to Bybit, which is almost perfectly balanced. These minor differences can sometimes reflect the dominant trading styles or demographics on different platforms. It’s important to remember that this ratio reflects *open positions*, not necessarily the volume or strength behind those positions. A few large ‘whale’ traders could potentially skew the ratio without representing the broader market sentiment accurately. Using the Ratio in Your Perpetual Futures Trading Strategy So, how can you use this long short ratio information in your own perpetual futures trading ? Think of it as one tool in your analytical toolbox, not the only one. Here are some actionable insights: Sentiment Confirmation: If you are considering a long trade based on other technical or fundamental analysis, a slightly long-biased ratio like this could offer minor confirmation of your view, suggesting you’re trading with the slight prevailing wind. Contrarian Indicator? Sometimes, extreme long or short ratios can be seen as a contrarian signal. If everyone is heavily long, who is left to buy to push the price higher? This current ratio isn’t extreme enough for a strong contrarian signal, but it’s a concept to keep in mind for future data points. Liquidation Risks: While not directly shown here, extreme ratios can build up ‘liquidity pools’ where a large number of stops or liquidations are clustered. A sudden move against the dominant side can trigger these, leading to cascading liquidations and rapid price swings. Monitoring ratios over time can give clues about where these clusters might be forming. Combine with Other Data: Never rely solely on the long-short ratio. Use it in conjunction with price action, volume analysis, funding rates (another key futures metric), and broader market news. Successful perpetual futures trading involves synthesizing multiple data points to form a complete picture. Beyond the Numbers: Limitations of the BTC Perpetual Futures Ratio While valuable, the long short ratio for BTC perpetual futures does have limitations: Lagging Indicator: The ratio reflects positions already taken. It doesn’t predict future entries or exits. Whale Influence: A few large positions can significantly impact the ratio, potentially masking the sentiment of smaller traders. Not Exchange-Inclusive: The ‘Total’ ratio is usually an aggregate of *some* major exchanges, but not necessarily *all* of them. Context is Key: A 51/49 ratio might mean different things depending on whether Bitcoin is trending strongly, ranging, or at a critical support/resistance level. Treat the ratio as a temperature check on market sentiment, not a definitive buy or sell signal. In Conclusion: What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Trading Sentiment Now? The latest 24-hour crypto futures data for BTC perpetual futures shows a market poised near equilibrium, with just a slight edge to the bulls based on the long short ratio . This suggests a period of relative indecision or consolidation among futures traders. While the sentiment isn’t overwhelmingly bullish or bearish, the slight lean towards long positions indicates that, on balance, more traders are betting on continued upward momentum or at least defending current price levels. For those engaged in perpetual futures trading , keeping an eye on how this ratio evolves, especially in response to price movements and news, can provide valuable context. Will the long bias strengthen, indicating growing confidence? Or will shorts start to increase, signaling potential downside pressure? Time, and continued data analysis, will tell.

2025-06-09T13:28:38,"Bitcoin, Ethereum & XRP Price Prediction This Week: Will CPI Data Trigger a Crypto Crash?","The post Bitcoin, Ethereum & XRP Price Prediction This Week: Will CPI Data Trigger a Crypto Crash? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The broader cryptocurrency market is on a rising spree over the last three days due to several optimistic factors, including positive US jobs report and a fresh restart of trade talks between the US and China. This has created a recovery path from the Thursday flash crash. However, this optimism is forecasted to have a short life, as the big shot cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple’s XRP are at a grave risk this week that could display similar movements like Thursday, June 5th. These outcomes are forecasted as the US-China trade talks on Monday in London, which is seen as a highly volatile catalyst, with the potential to cause sharp movements. Another most critical factor to watch is Wednesday’s CPI data , which is crucial for market sentiment. A Bloomberg survey suggests that inflation likely spiked in May due to tariffs. If the report shows a higher-than-expected number, it could trigger a bearish move, dampening crypto market sentiment by indicating a slowdown in consumer spending. Conversely, if the CPI comes in lower than expected, it could lead to significant gains for top cryptocurrencies and altcoins. Is $112K Coming In Bitcoin Price This Week? The Bitcoin price is exchanging hands at $107663, and it is recovering after it took support from the dynamic 50-day EMA band. It has broken the short-term declining trendline and is headed straight for the $112K mark. If the momentum continues and upcoming US CPI reports join in favour, then an ATH could be on its plate. Many experts are hoping for inflation to print soft, as the ongoing momentum looks strong and seems Bitcoin is not done yet. However, the platform Truflation highlights that inflation may be picking up, as in May it began with 1.35% and by month end it was 2.06%. If CPI prints similar to what the data’s are projecting, then the ongoing momentum could be short-lived and could risk falling around $100K or even to $95K. Additionally, on-chain data revealed a concerning trend: the Small wallets, holding up to 1 BTC, have been accumulating strongly. Historically, when the “small fish” holders buy with conviction, it often hints that whales could be preparing to sell into that liquidity. This retail fomo is considered by many as a fatal warning sign that a sell-off could be on its way. How XRP And ETH are Expected To Perform This Week? In the last three days, the Bitcoin price advancement has boosted altcoin’s prices too. Even XRP and Ethereum have risen 8% and 6% respectively. However, the gains are not enough to clear their bounded range; the XRP and ETH prices are facing key hurdles. If the CPI comes higher, then a fall in both altcoin prices seems likely, but if CPI comes soft then it could be a short-term catalyst to clear their nearest hurdles. If XRP price manages to rise, then $2.65 is this week’s target, and for Ethereum price , it is at $3066. On the downside, XRP could fall to $1.80, and ETH towards $2000, respectively. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-09T13:24:12,"CoinW Research: Navigating Value and Risk in the Blockchain Era","BitcoinWorld CoinW Research: Navigating Value and Risk in the Blockchain Era HONG KONG, June 9, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — In the fast-evolving cryptocurrency landscape, identifying high-quality assets while steering clear of hype-driven investments is a critical challenge for both investors and exchanges. As a key player in the industry, CoinW Research stands at the forefront of this task, committed to independence, integrity, and analytical rigor. With a data-driven and rational approach, it filters market noise, uncovers long-term value, and strengthens risk management frameworks. Serving as the core team for asset review and sector research, CoinW Research merges data science with industry expertise to offer insightful evaluations. Its work not only supports the platform’s sustainable development but also promotes the health of the broader blockchain ecosystem. Anchoring Value In a Shifting Market The early days of blockchain revolved around foundational innovations like Bitcoin and Ethereum—decentralized money and programmable smart contracts. Since its establishment in 2020, CoinW Research has witnessed the market’s transformation from speculative “aircoin” phases to a new era emphasizing fundamental value. Prior to the DeFi wave, the market was heavily influenced by ICOs, many of which prioritized hype over substance. This speculative bubble eventually gave way to the rise of DeFi—introducing practical financial utilities with transparency, composability, and real returns. CoinW Research emerged early as a value-oriented evaluator, developing its proprietary SCORE model—a comprehensive asset evaluation system that blends quantitative metrics with in-depth sectoral research. The model has become a benchmark for identifying quality assets. Its methodology evaluates factors like token distribution, vesting policies, and governance models. For example, the Institute’s recommendation of MYRO, a Solana-based meme coin, was based on its equitable tokenomics and active community. Its successful platform launch validated the Institute’s rigorous review process. The prevailing industry consensus is clear: sustainable blockchain growth hinges on technological innovation, not speculation. CoinW Research is committed to identifying enduring value and serving as a rational voice in a volatile market. The SCORE Model: A Holistic Approach to Asset Evaluation Built on principles of fairness, transparency, and deep market insight, the SCORE model assesses crypto assets across five key dimensions: Sector & Hype: Tracks market trends while filtering irrational speculation. Code & Security: Enforces strict security through smart contract audits and code transparency. Operations & Outreach: Evaluates project fundamentals such as economic models, marketing strategies, user growth, and community engagement to determine sustainability and market vitality. Resources & Teams: Assesses the experience and network strength of the project team as dual indicators of reliability. Evaluation & Data: Leverages on-chain analytics to reveal a project’s real value and activity. More than just a rating framework, SCORE embodies CoinW Research’s philosophy: identify real innovation, manage risk rigorously, and simplify decision-making for users and exchanges alike. From Strategy to Impact: Practical Success Stories SCORE is not theoretical—it delivers measurable outcomes. By leveraging this model, CoinW Research identifies promising opportunities ahead of the curve and shields users from high-risk or non-compliant projects. In 2020, CoinW Research analyzed early capital flows during the DeFi boom and listed top projects like YFI and YFII before they went mainstream—allowing users to ride the liquidity mining trend early. This proactive approach showcases the model’s predictive power and the Institute’s strategic foresight. Such results demonstrate CoinW Research’s value not just as an analytical team but as a market authority capable of guiding both users and platforms through complex industry cycles. Staying Ahead: Insight, Independence, and Execution Over years of experience, CoinW Research has adhered to four core principles: user-first thinking, independent judgment, industry foresight, and strategic execution. It acts as both a rigorous filter for listings and a benchmark in the Web3 space. When Sushiswap launched its now-famous “liquidity attack” on Uniswap in 2020, the Institute provided timely on-chain analysis, enabling CoinW to become one of the first exchanges to list SUSHI—reinforcing its leadership in data-informed decision-making. As DeFi evolved, CoinW Research deepened its technical research to help users identify sustainable, long-term opportunities. Navigating Hype: Caution During the BRC-20 Frenzy The BRC-20 boom in 2023 marked another speculative phase in the crypto market, as the Ordinals protocol introduced a novel way to inscribe data onto individual satoshis—creating a wave of inscription-based tokens on the Bitcoin network. As hype escalated and a flood of projects emerged, CoinW Research Institute maintained its disciplined approach. Upholding rigorous standards, the Institute approved only two projects—Ordi and SATS—after comprehensive security audits. This caution proved effective: SATS’s market cap skyrocketed from $10 million to over $2 billion, exemplifying the power of quality-over-quantity asset selection. By filtering out short-term noise and focusing on fundamentals, CoinW Research helps users navigate volatile markets—mitigating the 99% of risks to uncover the 1% of truly valuable opportunities. Decoding Meme Trends In 2024, CoinW identified early momentum within the Solana ecosystem, strategically backing meme coins like BOME and SLERF—which ultimately delivered outsized returns. While the broader market dismissed Pump.fun as a “junk coin factory,” CoinW Research recognized the underlying innovation in its auto-launch and burn mechanisms. Projects like MOODENG, which leveraged this infrastructure, gained early support from the Institute. This contrarian insight reflects CoinW Research’s willingness to challenge popular narratives and uncover value in unconventional places. The Rise of Decentralized AI and Infrastructure Partnerships In parallel, CoinW Research prioritized the rapidly emerging AI sector, listing projects like ARC and Virtual, which leverage AI to boost blockchain performance. CoinW Research anticipates that future breakthroughs—akin to Uniswap’s impact—may arise from decentralized AI protocols. Supporting public infrastructure also remains a priority. The Institute played a key role in launching Shardeum globally and formed strategic alliances with Solana to revitalize its ecosystem, reinforcing its commitment to long-term value creation. Its team—bringing together Web3 innovation and traditional finance experience—continues to transform conviction into disciplined research and strategic action. Finding Certainty Amid Market Uncertainty Over the past five years, CoinW Research Institute has consistently followed the principles of user focus, independence, industry insight, and future planning. It neither blindly chases trends nor remains complacent. Its success is rooted in a methodology that deeply integrates industry knowledge, data science, and risk management. In a noisy and chaotic market, truth lies in on-chain data and long-term trends. CoinW Research continues to illuminate the path to value discovery in cryptocurrency with clear-headed rationality.

2025-06-09T13:19:42,"Strategy announces 1,054 BTC purchase; price per Bitcoin now over $70K","Strategy bought another 1,054 BTC, extending the trend of relatively small, sustained purchases. The average price for the firm’s holdings is now $70,086, after several weeks of buying above $100,000. Strategy announced its latest weekly round of BTC purchases, this time adding 1,054 BTC. The last two weeks added under 2,000 BTC to the company’s treasury, raising the average purchase price to $70,086. In total, the Saylor-led firm also spent over $40B to date, while still seeking financing to add more BTC. Strategy has acquired 1,045 BTC for ~$110.2 million at ~$105,426 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 17.1% YTD 2025. As of 6/8/2025, we hodl 582,000 $BTC acquired for ~$40.79 billion at ~$70,086 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF $STRD https://t.co/blyWfRskjE — Strategy (@Strategy) June 9, 2025 The weekly purchases are not tied to specific BTC dips and often lead to price expansion. However, the size of purchases corresponds to the sale of one or more types of Strategy stock . The latest purchase follows the placement of $62.7M in STRK and $43.3M in STRF shares. No new MSTR shares were registered, per the latest filing . Strategy raised $112M per its latest filing, with no new MSTR common stock sold, avoiding the dilution of BTC per share. | Source: Strategy filings Since no new MSTR common stock was sold in the latest round, Strategy is still a leader by a factor of 10 when it comes to BTC per share. The company holds 0.02 BTC per share, though not all stock buyers have a claim on the treasury in the case of emergency compensation. From June 10 onward, Strategy will launch the sale of STRD , a new type of high-risk perpetual stock with a non-mandatory 10% dividend. The new shares are riskier in terms of returns and compensation, but may boost the sales of STRF and STRK. Strategy still inspires other BTC buyers Strategy continues to influence other companies, starting even with minimal BTC purchases. Only 26 other corporate holders have more than 1,000 BTC in their treasuries, with most of them retaining legacy holdings. Just seven entities hold more than 10,000 BTC, despite the on-chain evidence of close to 2,000 top whale wallets with even bigger holdings. In the past week, five other companies bought more BTC, while also using the purchase announcement to boost their social media presence. Already, 124 public companies have announced some form of BTC treasury, with even more setting up expectations of future purchases. Even with the relatively slow purchases, large-scale entities already hold 3.4M BTC, which by all indications will remain off the market. The corporate purchases, miner holdings and no more sales from government wallets also diminish the amount of easily available BTC. The latest data shows OTC desks only hold 123.5K BTC, down from 236K about a month ago. OTC desks are key for supplying ETFs, as well as potential corporate buyers. Coinbase Prime retains 63,537 BTC for sale, in addition to a falling balance on exchanges. Ahead of the latest Strategy announcement, BTC also rallied above $107,000 within an hour. The leading coin traded at $107,975, rising above the latest purchase price. MSTR recovered to $374.47, partially compensating for the fall of Tesla (TSLA).

2025-06-09T13:18:55,"Crypto Community Shocked as Neo Pepe $NEOP Challenges Bitcoin Pepe, Solaxy with Unmatched Innovation","The post Crypto Community Shocked as Neo Pepe $NEOP Challenges Bitcoin Pepe, Solaxy with Unmatched Innovation appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Neo Pepe’s Groundbreaking Launch Crypto analysts and investors are in a frenzy following the sensational June 2025 launch of Neo Pepe ($NEOP), a revolutionary project rapidly reshaping the cryptocurrency presale landscape. Positioned as a formidable competitor to prominent presale projects like Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) and Solaxy (SOLX), Neo Pepe’s combination of cutting-edge tokenomics, innovative liquidity mechanisms, and visionary community governance has triggered intense debate and curiosity throughout the crypto community. Could Neo Pepe be exactly the innovation investors have long sought? Advanced Tokenomics At the heart of Neo Pepe’s rapid ascent is its carefully structured 16-phase presale model, starting at a remarkably accessible $0.05 per token and incrementally climbing to $0.16 in the final phase. Unlike typical presales, Neo Pepe strategically locks tokens until the official launch, after which they unlock hourly in proportion to their presale phase. This ingenious token-release schedule dramatically reduces the volatility commonly associated with newly launched tokens. In comparison, presale projects such as Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) and Solaxy (SOLX), while popular, have yet to implement similar depth in their token-release strategies. Industry analysts have begun debating vigorously—does Neo Pepe’s sophisticated model set a transformative new benchmark for presale economics? Comparison of Neo Pepe ($NEOP) vs. Solaxy (SOLX) Feature Neo Pepe ($NEOP) Solaxy (SOLX) Tokenomics 16-phase incremental presale model to reduce volatility Basic token release without advanced phased approach Liquidity Mechanism 2.5% auto-allocation with immediate token burning for stability No comparable liquidity strategy Governance Structure Advanced decentralized governance (Governor contracts, multisig treasuries, Zodiac modules) Minimal governance involvement Price Stability Hourly token unlocking schedule post-launch to ensure gradual stability No structured approach to price stabilization Innovation & Vision Combines economics, governance, and liquidity innovation to redefine presale standards Primarily relies on general blockchain claims without detailed structural advancements Auto-Liquidity Innovation Neo Pepe further differentiates itself with an advanced liquidity mechanism unlike anything the presale market has seen. With each transaction, Neo Pepe automatically allocates 2.5% toward liquidity pools, immediately burning these liquidity tokens. This cutting-edge design ensures continual market stability, actively reducing volatility risks and securing long-term investor confidence. This distinct approach contrasts sharply with competing presale projects like Solaxy (SOLX) and Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP), which have yet to incorporate comparable liquidity innovations. Crypto experts are openly speculating whether Neo Pepe’s pioneering liquidity solution might compel competitors to adopt similar models, potentially reshaping presale project standards across the crypto industry. Governance Raises Investor Expectations Perhaps the most captivating feature driving investor enthusiasm around Neo Pepe is its sophisticated decentralized governance structure. Powered by advanced infrastructure—including Governor contracts, TimelockControllers, and multisignature treasury management with Zodiac Module integration—Neo Pepe empowers investors to actively influence critical project decisions, such as exchange listings and strategic initiatives. While presale projects like Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) and Solaxy (SOLX) focus primarily on meme-driven marketing or speculative appeal, Neo Pepe firmly emphasizes meaningful investor involvement and transparent governance. The broader crypto community now eagerly questions whether Neo Pepe’s commitment to genuine investor empowerment will redefine expectations for presale governance across the entire crypto ecosystem. Neo Pepe vs. Bitcoin Pepe, Solaxy By directly contrasting Neo Pepe’s revolutionary presale model with popular presale competitors Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) and Solaxy (SOLX), crypto analysts have quickly noted critical differences. Bitcoin Pepe leans heavily into the familiarity of Bitcoin’s brand appeal combined with meme-centric marketing, whereas Solaxy positions itself as an innovative blockchain platform yet lacks the sophisticated economic and governance structures Neo Pepe presents. These direct comparisons have sparked intense investor curiosity and vibrant community dialogue. Industry forums actively debate whether Neo Pepe’s superior structural integrity and innovative features will reshape investor expectations and force other presale coins to evolve accordingly. The powerful combination of advanced tokenomics, revolutionary liquidity strategies, and investor-centric governance positions Neo Pepe distinctly ahead of competitors in the presale landscape. Investors and industry experts alike are deeply intrigued, sparking broad discussion on whether Neo Pepe signals a transformative turning point for crypto presales, fundamentally changing the industry’s approach to token launches. How does Neo Pepe’s presale model reduce volatility?. Neo Pepe employs a unique 16-phase presale with tokens gradually unlocking hourly post-launch. This controlled approach significantly minimizes sudden price fluctuations often seen in typical presale launches. What makes Neo Pepe’s liquidity mechanism innovative? Neo Pepe automatically dedicates 2.5% of every transaction to liquidity pools, immediately burning these tokens. This innovative process maintains steady market stability and investor confidence long-term. How can investors actively participate in Neo Pepe’s governance? Neo Pepe leverages advanced decentralized governance systems, including multisignature treasury management and Zodiac Module integration, empowering token holders to directly influence strategic decisions, such as exchange listings and project developments. The crypto community now keenly debates whether Neo Pepe’s unique structure represents the future of sustainable and investor-friendly blockchain presales. Neo Pepe’s Revolutionary Crypto Movement Investors inspired by Neo Pepe’s revolutionary vision and seeking meaningful participation in what could be crypto’s most groundbreaking presale yet are invited to join the community through Neo Pepe’s official Website .

2025-06-09T13:18:55,"Saylor Mocks Quantum Threat as a Scheme to Sell Tokens","Speaking on CNBC, Saylor said major tech companies like Google or Microsoft would never unleash quantum technology recklessly, as it would endanger the global digital infrastructure, including their own businesses. He added that Bitcoin is capable of upgrading its cryptographic systems if the need arises. While research firm Project Eleven warns millions of Bitcoin could be vulnerable if quantum computing advances, current machines are far from meeting the required qubit threshold. Meanwhile, Saylor continues his bullish stance, and recently teased Strategy’s ninth straight week of Bitcoin accumulation. The announcement was made after a $75 million BTC purchase and a $1 billion preferred stock offering to fund even more buys. Similarly, Europe’s Blockchain Group is planning to raise $342 million to grow its BTC treasury. Quantum Threat to Bitcoin Is Just Marketing Hype? Bitcoin bull and Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor dismissed the growing concerns about quantum computing’s potential threat to Bitcoin, and labeled it a marketing tactic that is designed to promote quantum-themed tokens. In a June 6 appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” Saylor stated bluntly that fears surrounding quantum computing’s ability to break Bitcoin’s cryptographic defenses are overblown and largely propagated by those who want to profit off hype. “It’s mainly marketing from people that want to sell you the next quantum yo-yo token,” he said. The crypto community has long speculated about whether future advances in quantum computing could undermine Bitcoin’s security by cracking its elliptic curve cryptography ( ECC ). Quantum research firm Project Eleven even warned that more than 10 million Bitcoin addresses with exposed public keys—and potentially over 6 million BTC—could be vulnerable if such computing power becomes a reality. Still, Saylor insists that if quantum computing ever evolves to the point of being a genuine threat, it wouldn’t be used recklessly. He argued that technology giants like Google or Microsoft will never release such a machine, as doing so could destabilize the global digital infrastructure, including their own businesses and even the US government. “Google and Microsoft aren’t going to sell you a computer that cracks modern cryptography,” he said, mainly due to the widespread damage that would ensue. In the hypothetical scenario where quantum machines do pose a real risk, Saylor believes the Bitcoin network will adapt, just as any modern digital system does. He also explained that Bitcoin’s open-source infrastructure allows for software and hardware upgrades, much like updates seen regularly across Microsoft, Google, and government systems. For now, quantum hardware is still far from capable of breaking Bitcoin’s ECC. Project Eleven estimates that roughly 2,000 error-corrected, or “logical,” qubits will be needed to crack a 256-bit Bitcoin key. IBM’s Heron chip and Google’s Willow currently only support 156 and 105 qubits respectively. Despite this, Project Eleven recently launched a “Q-Day Prize” competition to test how close the quantum threat really is. For now, Saylor believes that the bigger risk to Bitcoin holders is not quantum computing but phishing attacks. Strategy Nears Ninth Straight Week of Bitcoin Buys Michael Saylor’s confidence in Bitcoin is still very clear as he once again stirred speculation in the Bitcoin community after posting “Send more Orange” on X, alongside a chart of the company’s Bitcoin holdings. Saylor’s June 8 post led many to believe that yet another BTC purchase may be imminent. If confirmed, it will be the ninth consecutive week of Bitcoin accumulation by Strategy. The post was made after the company’s recent purchase of 705 BTC between May 26 and June 1, at an average price of $106,495 per coin. This $75 million acquisition pushed the firm’s total Bitcoin holdings to 580,955 BTC, which is valued at roughly $61.4 billion. According to data from SaylorTracker , the company has seen a return of approximately 50% on its investment. In tandem with the social media post, Strategy announced an expansion of its capital-raising efforts through a $1 billion stock offering . This move upsizes the previously announced $250 million raise. The company plans to sell 11.76 million shares of its 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock at $85 per share, with anticipated net proceeds of around $979 million after deducting underwriting and other associated costs. The preferred stock carries non-cumulative 10% dividends, and is designed to attract institutional and professional investors who are looking for yield while also making it possible for Strategy to expand its Bitcoin treasury. Strategy cemented itself as the largest known holder of Bitcoin globally, with more BTC in its possession than the United States and China combined. Its massive holdings are nearly twelve times bigger than those of the next-largest holder, Bitcoin miner Mara Holdings. As a result, many investors now vsee Strategy as a de facto Bitcoin holding company, serving as a proxy for institutional exposure to the cryptocurrency. Top Bitcoin holders (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) Blockchain Group Pushes Bitcoin Bet Paris-based cryptocurrency firm The Blockchain Group also has high expectations for Bitcoin, and announced plans to raise more than $340 million to expand its Bitcoin treasury. According to a June 10 news release , the company is seeking to raise 300 million euros, or approximately $342 million, by using a structure inspired by the US-style “At the Market” (ATM) offering. This model allows shares to be sold under market conditions set by a counterpart in a pre-agreed volume framework. The capital raise will take place in tranches, with pricing determined by the higher of either the previous day's closing price or the volume-weighted average price, capped at 21% of that day’s trading volume. This announcement was made after the company’s recent acquisition of $68 million worth of Bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 1,471 BTC. The Blockchain Group is Europe’s first dedicated Bitcoin treasury company, and appears to be following the footsteps of major US players like Michael Saylor’s Strategy. With more than $61 billion in Bitcoin on its balance sheet, Strategy holds about 2.76% of the total circulating BTC supply. These large-scale treasury allocations are playing an increasingly central role in sustaining Bitcoin’s long-term bullish narrative, even as the asset consolidates after its record high of $112,000 that was reached on May 22. According to Nexo’s Stella Zlatareva , institutional purchases and infrastructure investment are strong signals of enduring confidence, despite the recent short-term volatility. Bitcoin’s recent bounce from the $103,000 support level further proves that there is market resilience, with no widespread signs of forced selling or deleveraging. Bitcoin ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) However, the US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs faced renewed outflows . Data from Farside Investors showed that these ETFs recorded $47 million in outflows on Friday after a painful $278 million outflow the previous day.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9494/saylor-mocks-quantum-threat-as-a-scheme-to-sell-tokens,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-06-09T13:15:10,"XRP and Solana Added to Nasdaq Crypto Index: Market Expansion Imminent?","The Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index (NCIUS) was updated on June 2 to include four new cryptocurrencies: Solana ($SOL), Cardano ($ADA), Stellar ($XLM), and XRP ($XRP). Earlier, it had only included $BTC and $ETH. While this is great news for the development of the broader crypto market, it ‘s caused an issue for the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF (NCIQ). This ETF tracks the NCIUS index to provide weighted exposure in $ETH and $BTC. Until now, it could replicate the index with precision and minimum divergence. However, even though the composition of NCIUS has now changed, the ETF isn’t permitted to track any assets other than Bitcoin and Ethereum. This has caused a mismatch between the fund’s objective and the index it is tracking. NASDAQ has submitted a proposal to let NCIQ track the Nasdaq Crypto Index (NCI) instead of the current NCIUS. The NCI index also includes $SOL, $ADA, $XLM, and $XRP, as well as $LINK, $LTC, and $UNI. The SEC is expected to respond by November 2, 2025. In any case, there’s no denying Wall Street is now adopting a more inclusive approach to crypto, looking at assets other than Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin is a Great Buy Even at $106K In other pro-crypto developments, John Deaton, an ace Bitcoin investor and XRP supporter, took to X to voice his analysis that $BTC ‘s a safer buy at $106K than it was at $20K.’ He believes that the risk-to-reward ratio is more favorable now than when Bitcoin was trading much lower. Deaton also said that the current macroeconomic conditions will gradually undermine people’s confidence in fiat currencies. For example, growing national debt and exorbitant tariffs are big red flags for the cash economy. In such a scenario, ‘digital gold’ emerges as a clear alternative. First, $BTC’s supply is limited, so corporations and governments can’t manipulate it. Secondly, companies and countries, both large and small, are racing to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets, pushing up the price. Michael Saylor’s Strategy, for instance, now owns more than 580K $BTC, and 16 firms added it to their balance sheets just last week. Governments across the board, like Ireland, Pakistan, and Ukraine, are considering creating their own Bitcoin reserves after the US announced it would pursue one. All these signals show that Bitcoin is here to stay and only goes from strength to strength. If you, too, are keen on milking $BTC to the last possible drop, we’d like to introduce you to BTC Bull Token . What Is BTC Bull Token? BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) has taken a simple idea – to cheer on the greatest digital asset, Bitcoin – and transformed it into one of the best meme coins on the market right now. With a muscular bull as its mascot and a website theme that mimics Bitcoin’s bright gold color, BTC Bull Token wears its Bitcoin bullish badge with pride. According to its whitepaper , it’s ‘the unstoppable force pushing Bitcoin towards $1M+.’ It does this by being the ONLY crypto today offering free (and completely legitimate) $BTC to its token holders. Every time Bitcoin claims a new major milestone, like $150K and $200K, $BTCBULL holders who have stored their tokens in Best Wallet will stand a chance to earn real Bitcoins. Note: the $BTC amount you receive will depend on the number of $BTCBULL tokens you bought in the Community Sale. Also, subscribe to BTC Bull Token’s social media ( X and Telegram ) for updates about the airdrop events, as you’ll have to opt in to qualify. Burn Tokens, Create Hype, and Enjoy Profits The developers have done everything to ensure the project’s success, including using a deflationary approach, also known as a token burn mechanism, which sees the project shaving off a part of the total token supply to push the price. These ‘token burn’ events will take place every time Bitcoin’s price increases by $50K, starting from $125K. Incentives like these, combined with a chunky 40% of the total supply reserved for PR and marketing, suggest BTC Bull Token could become one of the top trending cryptos after its launch. $BTCBULL Is Currently Cheaper than It Will Ever Be Hell-bent on backing Bitcoin to $1M and beyond? Get BTC Bull Token ! According to our research, $BTCBULL can surge past $0.0497 by 2030 – a mind-boggling rise of over 1,800% in less than five years. That’s aside from the chance to win real $BTC (currently worth over $105K) if you’re a $BTCBULL owner. The good news is the token is still in presale, meaning you can grab it for just $0.002555. The project has already raised around $7M in early investor funding and is raring to go once it launches. You can read all about it in our What is BTC Bull Token guide. More Cryptos Go Mainstream, but $BTC Remains the Greatest New ETFs supporting modern cryptocurrencies like Solana and XRP represent a healthy diversification in the market, but the fact remains, there’s only one Bitcoin. With an innovative approach towards airdrops, a classic token burn mechanism, and a lively community of crypto degens, BTC Bull Token nevertheless could emerge as the next big crypto coin to follow in Bitcoin’s footsteps. That said, make sure to do your own research before investing.

2025-06-09T13:13:34,"Major Announcement Concerning All Shiba Inu (SHIB) Users: Details","TL;DR Precision liquidity pools, multi-source staking rewards, and real-time on-chain token burns are among the new features of Shibarium. The protocol’s advancements are seen as vital for Shiba Inu’s ecosystem growth, with some experts suggesting it could reignite SHIB’s rally if adoption improves. The ‘Total Upgrade’ LUCIE, the pseudonymous marketing strategist of Shibarium, took it to X to disclose the latest improvements surrounding the layer-2 scaling solution. “This isn’t a cosmetic refresh. It’s a total upgrade to the engine that powers how you earn, trade, and burn inside the ecosystem,” the disclosure starts. Specifically, LUCIE explained that precision liquidity pools are live following the development. Liquidity providers can now choose exactly where to provide liquidity and target specific zones. The X user also revealed that individuals who stake tokens are enabled to earn from multiple sources simultaneously. “It’s compounding without the micromanagement. Keep it up all in one spot and let the rewards stack up,” they added. Perhaps the biggest improvement after the upgrade is related to the burning program. LUCIE unveiled that users will no longer need to wait for announcements to burn tokens as they will happen on-chain , in real-time. Subsequently, Shibarium’s lead said all major tools now run together “smoothly,” sharing five valuable tips for “real users:” “Lock LPs into price ranges for better APY. Combine rewards across protocols. Exit and re-enter LP zones without losing gains. Burn as you go. Stay agile when the market moves.” Shibarium’s Revival Shiba Inu’s layer-2 blockchain solution plays a vital role in Shiba Inu’s overall ecosystem growth. It officially came into existence in August 2023, aiming to reduce transaction costs, improve speed, and enhance scalability. Shibarium’s advancement is touted by some industry participants as a main factor that could give SHIB a boost for a renewed rally. Not long ago, the Bitcoin advocate Jeremie Davinci said: “I like Shiba Inu, as you know, and I think it will do relatively well in this cycle, but it may not go as high as you expect. I think Shiba Inu has a lot of utility now that they have Shibarium, and basically , it’s a chain that you can actually run all kinds of applications. However, nobody is using it, and there are no applications for using your tokens on Shibarium yet . If they get that solved, Shiba Inu will go to the moon.” Towards the end of May, the number of daily transactions processed on the protocol sharply collapsed . Nonetheless, over the weekend, there was a significant resurgence , and the figure is back in the millions.
