2025-06-09T11:48:49,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Will This Week’s CPI Report Trigger a Rally?","The post Bitcoin Price Prediction: Will This Week’s CPI Report Trigger a Rally? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin traders are on alert this week as U.S.-China trade talks begin and key U.S. inflation and job reports are set to be released. If inflation heats up, it could shake markets and impact Bitcoin’s price. Everyone’s watching closely over what’s next for Bitcoin. Bitcoin slightly recovered today and is currently trading at $107,423, up 1.8% in the past day. It traded flat near $105,650 after forming a doji candle on Sunday. Its network activity has also slowed with daily on-chain transactions dropping to a one-year low, according to Blockchain.com . Altcoins like XRP and DOGE also fell 1-2%. But they have recovered slightly today and are trading in green. Bitcoin Stuck In a Tight Range QCP Capital in a latest note shared that traders are keeping a close eye on Bitcoin as it stays stuck in a tight range heading into the summer. Even though implied volatility is at 1-year lows and looks cheap, actual price moves are even smaller. Historically, the short term volatility usually drops more by July, just like last year when Bitcoin struggled to break $70K and the volatility fell sharply. They pointed out that if Bitcoin breaks below $100K or jumps above $110K, it could spark fresh interest in the market. But for now, there is no clear event to push it that way. While the recent macro news caused quick and short live reactions for a moment, but those moves quickly faded without any lasting effect. Bitcoin Up For a Big Move In the Long Term? After the strong US jobs report boosted the stock market and caused gold prices to fall, Bitcoin was mostly unchanged and showed signs of slowing down. The trading activity in Bitcoin futures is increasing and fewer investor are putting money into Bitcoin ETFs. Traders are now betting on Bitcoin to do well later in the year, not anytime soon. Bitcoin might be gearing up for a move higher as fresh data shows a big liquidity zone around $106,736. These zones often pull price action like a magnet, and with BTC already testing $105K, a breakout could be on the way. New All-time Highs Soon? Also, Bitcoin’s realized profit/loss has dropped 90% since June 4, which means that fewer investors are selling at a loss. This reduces the selling pressure and supports a potential rise. With Bitcoin showing no clear direction on the daily chart, analysts believe that it might dip further before making a move toward new all-time highs. Analsyts at Swissblock warn that rising inflation could trigger volatility, and BTC may test support around $104K. Analyst Mickybull Crypto also sees a possible drop to $101,500 due to a head-and-shoulders pattern. If BTC loses the $100K level, it could face a deeper correction. ““Short-term correction, then new all-time highs,” he said. Bitcoin, what is the plan? Inflation data in the week ahead could unleash volatility. Bulls are slowly rebuilding structure and regrouping, eager to flip the game. First steps are in, but a short-term test of the lower range ($104k) looks likely. Stay sharp. pic.twitter.com/PI6HBSVyhL — Swissblock (@swissblock__) June 9, 2025 Analysts say that any price dip will be short-lived because the long-term uptrend is strong. Once it breaks the 2021 trendline, it could quickly climb to $140K–$150K. Bitcoin’s weekly chart also shows strong bullish signs with both a cup-and-handle and a bull flag pattern, pointing to a possible breakout above $109,000. These patterns suggest BTC could surge about 35%, reaching around $143,000. Key Events This Week- Market optimism is high as the U.S. China trade talks kick off in London, with Trump saying the meeting “should go very well.” All eyes are now on Wednesday’s US inflation report to see if the tariffs are pushing prices higher. If inflation is hotter than expected, it could reduce chances of Fed rate cuts and shake up markets.

Citing data from Goldman Sachs, macro analyst Adam Kobeissi reports that $37 billion left US equities in May, which is the most in at least 12 months. “This marks the 2nd consecutive monthly net withdrawal after -$7 billion in April. Year-to-date, foreign investors have withdrawn a net -$31 billion from US equities. By comparison, these same investors bought a net +$201 billion in November and December last year. This comes even as the market recovers and the 90-day reciprocal tariff pause that began on April 10th. Foreigners are rotating out of US stocks.” Source: The Kobeissi Letter/X However, Kobeissi also reports that retail investors are picking up the slack, buoying markets, potentially compensating for foreign investors’ capital flight. Citing data from JPMorgan Chase, the analyst reports that retail investors are gobbling up tens of billions of dollars worth of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and individual equities. “Retail investors bought +$23 billion of US equities in May, adding to +$40 billion in March and April. This is roughly in-line with $25 billion in average monthly net purchases this year, according to JPMorgan. Year-to-date, individual investors have bought a record +$150 billion in ETFs and single stocks. Over the last week, retail traders purchased $6.8 billion, with $4.4 billion flowing into Tesla, TSLA.

2025-06-09T11:40:34,"Crucial Economic Events This Week: What Crypto Investors Must Watch","BitcoinWorld Crucial Economic Events This Week: What Crypto Investors Must Watch Hello crypto enthusiasts! Navigating the cryptocurrency market isn’t just about tracking Bitcoin charts and altcoin news. Macroeconomic factors play a significant role, often driving volatility across all financial assets, including digital ones. This week brings several key US economic events this week that demand your attention. Understanding these releases can provide crucial insights into potential market movements. Why Do US Economic Events Matter for Crypto? You might wonder why data from the traditional US economy affects decentralized digital currencies. The answer lies in global market sentiment, liquidity, and interest rate expectations. Data indicating inflation trends or labor market health can influence the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions. Changes in interest rates and quantitative easing/tightening directly impact the flow of capital, affecting investor risk appetite. When investors are cautious due to economic uncertainty or rising rates, riskier assets like cryptocurrencies can see outflows. Conversely, signs of economic weakness might sometimes lead to expectations of dovish policy, potentially boosting risk assets. Therefore, keeping an eye on the economic events this week is essential for informed trading and investment decisions in the crypto space. Inflation Watch: Understanding CPI and PPI Data Inflation data is perhaps the most closely watched economic indicator right now, as it heavily influences central bank policy. This week features two major inflation reports: Wednesday, June 11th (12:30 UTC): U.S. Core CPI (YoY) (May) Thursday, June 12th (12:30 UTC): U.S. PPI (YoY) (May) The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. The Core CPI excludes volatile items like food and energy to give a clearer picture of underlying inflation trends. The Producer Price Index (PPI) measures the average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. It can be a leading indicator for CPI, as producer costs often pass on to consumers. Both reports are released on a Year-over-Year (YoY) basis, comparing prices to the same month in the previous year. This provides a broader perspective than monthly changes, smoothing out short-term fluctuations. What Does This Inflation Data Mean for Crypto? Higher-than-expected CPI data or PPI data can signal persistent inflation, potentially leading the Federal Reserve to maintain a hawkish stance (higher interest rates, tighter liquidity). This environment is generally seen as negative for risk assets like crypto. Conversely, data showing inflation is cooling could increase hopes for future rate cuts or a more dovish stance, which can be positive for crypto markets. Pay close attention to how these numbers compare to market expectations. Labor Market Insights: Keeping an Eye on Jobless Claims Beyond inflation, labor market health is another key indicator of economic momentum. While major reports like Non-Farm Payrolls are monthly, weekly data provides a continuous pulse: Thursday, June 12th (12:30 UTC): U.S. Initial Jobless Claims Initial Jobless Claims measure the number of individuals who filed for unemployment benefits for the first time during the past week. It’s a timely indicator of the health of the labor market. A significant increase in jobless claims can signal a weakening economy, potentially leading to reduced consumer spending and overall economic slowdown. How Do Jobless Claims Impact the Crypto Market? While not as directly impactful as inflation data, persistently rising jobless claims can contribute to recession fears. In such a scenario, investors might become more risk-a-averse, potentially pulling funds from speculative assets like crypto. However, significant labor market weakness could also increase the likelihood of the Fed cutting rates to stimulate the economy, which could eventually be seen as positive for risk assets. It’s a complex interplay, but monitoring this data provides another piece of the economic puzzle. Preparing for Potential Volatility With these crucial economic events this week on the calendar, market participants should prepare for potential volatility, particularly around the release times (12:30 UTC on Wednesday and Thursday). Unexpected results from the CPI data , PPI data , or jobless claims can trigger rapid price swings in both traditional markets and cryptocurrencies. Actionable Insights: Stay Informed: Keep these release times noted in your calendar. Monitor Reactions: Observe how markets, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, react immediately following the data releases. Manage Risk: If you are actively trading, consider adjusting position sizes or using stop-loss orders to manage potential sudden moves. Look Beyond the Headlines: Understand the context – is the data a one-off anomaly or part of a developing trend? Understanding the macroeconomic backdrop is a vital skill for anyone serious about navigating the crypto landscape. These upcoming US economic reports offer a chance to gauge the current state of inflation and the labor market, providing valuable context for potential shifts in market sentiment and monetary policy expectations, which ultimately influence the crypto market impact . Summary: Eyes on the Data This week presents key US economic data points that crypto investors and traders should monitor closely. The May Core CPI and PPI reports will offer fresh insights into inflation trends, while weekly Initial Jobless Claims will provide a snapshot of the labor market’s health. The outcomes of these releases, especially relative to expectations, can significantly influence market sentiment and potentially lead to increased volatility in the cryptocurrency market. Staying informed about these economic events this week is crucial for making more informed decisions in the dynamic world of digital assets.

2025-06-09T11:40:07,"Cetus and Alex Protocol Restore Services Following Major Exploits","In a challenging period for decentralized finance platforms, both Cetus Protocol and Alex Protocol have suffered major exploits, highlighting ongoing vulnerabilities in emerging DeFi ecosystems. Operating on the Sui and Stacks blockchains respectively, the two platforms lost a combined $231 million in recent attacks. Each has since announced user reimbursement plans and protocol upgrades, signaling a renewed commitment to security and resilience as the Bitcoin DeFi landscape matures. Cetus Protocol Relaunches After $223M Hack, Restores Majority of Liquidity Pools and Charts Path Forward In a major comeback for one of the most severely affected decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms this year, Cetus Protocol — a cross-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) operating on the Sui and Aptos blockchains — officially relaunched on Sunday following a devastating $223 million exploit on May 22. The protocol has not only restored full platform functionality but also managed to replenish between 85% and 99% of user funds in affected liquidity pools, according to an announcement from the Cetus team. The attack, which leveraged a critical integer overflow vulnerability in a shared math library used by Cetus’ smart contracts, allowed an unknown hacker to deposit a single token and have it appear as millions in value. The manipulation effectively enabled the draining of liquidity pools on the Sui side of the protocol in what has become the largest DeFi exploit of May 2025. Emergency Response and Partial Recovery In the immediate aftermath of the breach, Sui validators quickly moved to freeze $162 million of the stolen funds — a rare and controversial move in decentralized ecosystems. These funds have since been returned to Cetus Protocol. Combined with the platform’s remaining $7 million in treasury reserves and a substantial $30 million USDC loan provided by the Sui Foundation, Cetus was able to replenish the majority of user funds and bring the protocol back online. The team also confirmed that any remaining balances owed to liquidity providers (LPs) will be distributed in the form of CETUS tokens, the protocol’s native governance and utility token, over a 12-month linear vesting schedule. This repayment schedule is contingent on no further recovery of stolen assets from the hacker. According to blockchain security firm SlowMist, the attack was not spontaneous but carefully premeditated. The hacker funded a dedicated wallet two days prior to the incident, ensuring sufficient gas to carry out the exploit. An earlier attempt to execute the same exploit failed, signaling a high level of technical sophistication and iterative planning. The exploit hinged on the checked_shlw function, which was manipulated using highly specific parameters to create the illusion of massive token deposits. While the damage was extensive, it was limited solely to the Sui-based pools. Cetus’ Aptos-based pools remained untouched, as the vulnerability did not exist in those smart contracts. Ongoing Challenges and Asset Laundering Despite the successful relaunch and partial recovery, the protocol faces an uphill battle in reclaiming tens of millions of dollars still under the attacker’s control. The hacker has reportedly moved some of the assets to an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) address and initiated transfers through Tornado Cash, a well-known transaction obfuscation tool. “The attacker ignored our previous whitehat offer and has begun attempting to launder assets — a futile and traceable act,” Cetus wrote in its official statement. “We are highly confident that successful arrest and recovering the remaining assets is only a matter of time.” In an effort to rebuild trust with users and the broader DeFi community, Cetus Protocol has pledged to launch another round of extensive smart contract audits. Additionally, the team plans to upgrade the platform’s real-time monitoring systems and introduce a new white-hat bounty program aimed at proactively identifying and resolving vulnerabilities. “This restart signifies more than just a relaunch, but a renewal,” the team stated, signaling a broader transformation in how the protocol approaches security and development going forward. While the relaunch is being hailed as a resilient response in a sector still haunted by high-profile exploits, it hasn't spared CETUS from bearish market reactions. The token has declined approximately 44% since the day before the attack, according to data from CoinGecko. However, renewed confidence from the community, strengthened governance, and strategic backing from the Sui Foundation could help support a long-term recovery. A Cautionary Tale with Lessons for All of DeFi The Cetus incident serves as yet another reminder of the fragility of DeFi protocols and the devastating consequences of even the smallest unchecked vulnerability in smart contracts. While the protocol’s swift action and transparent communications have helped soften the blow for many users, the event shows the need for continuous auditing, better tooling for anomaly detection, and stricter internal security frameworks in the world of permissionless finance. The success or failure of Cetus Protocol’s revival may ultimately depend on how well it can turn this painful experience into a springboard for reform — and on whether it can recover the remaining assets still circulating in dark corners of the blockchain. SUI Price Jumps 3% The SUI price responded positively to the news, with CoinMarketCap data showing the altcoin gained over 3% in the last 24 hours. As a result, the crypto is trading at $3.32 at press time, and is around 37% away from the all-time high (ATH) of $5.35 that it set on Jan. 6, 2025. Alex Protocol Suffers $8.3M Exploit on Stacks Blockchain, Promises Full Reimbursement to Users In another serious setback for DeFi, Alex Protocol—a flagship DeFi platform built on the Stacks blockchain—confirmed it had fallen victim to a significant exploit on June 6, 2025, resulting in the loss of approximately $8.3 million in digital assets. The attack has emerged as one of the most damaging hacks to date on the Stacks network and has once again raised pressing questions around security in the growing Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem. The exploit was caused by a vulnerability in the protocol’s self-listing verification logic, which the attacker leveraged to siphon off funds from several liquidity pools. In a statement on X , Alex Protocol said it had identified the breach and was working with relevant stakeholders to mitigate further fallout. Millions Drained Across Multiple Assets The attacker managed to extract a diverse array of assets, including: 8.4 million Stacks (STX) tokens 21.85 Stacks Bitcoin (sBTC) 149,850 USDC and USDT stablecoins 2.8 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) Based on prevailing prices at the time, the total haul amounted to more than $8.3 million—a sum that underscores the gravity of the exploit and represents a substantial hit to liquidity providers on the platform. Despite the scale of the incident, Alex Protocol moved quickly to assure its user base that affected funds would be fully reimbursed using the organization’s treasury reserves. The reimbursement plan, coordinated by the Alex Lab Foundation, aims to restore user trust and prevent a mass exodus from the protocol amid growing concerns over smart contract vulnerabilities. Alex Lab announced that all compensation will be issued in USDC, a widely used stablecoin, and calculated based on average onchain exchange rates between 10:00 am and 2:00 pm UTC on the day of the attack. The foundation stated that it believes this time window provides a fair and representative basis for restoring lost value. Affected wallets are expected to receive an onchain notification by June 8, along with a personalized claim form. Users must fill out the form with a preferred receiving wallet address by June 10. The team has committed to verifying claims and distributing the reimbursements within seven days of claim confirmation. Users who do not receive a notification were encouraged to contact the team via email. Lack of Technical Disclosure — For Now While the team has been transparent in acknowledging the attack and outlining reimbursement plans, it has not yet released a technical post-mortem. The community is currently awaiting a detailed report that will provide insight into how the flaw in the self-listing logic was exploited and what changes will be implemented to prevent a recurrence. The incident has drawn attention from the broader crypto community, with many questioning whether current smart contract auditing practices on Stacks-based DeFi platforms are sufficient to handle increasingly sophisticated threats. This is not the first time Alex Protocol has been hit by a significant exploit. In May 2024, the platform experienced a $4.3 million hack involving its cross-chain bridge infrastructure. That exploit led to unauthorized withdrawals of assets and was later linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group, one of the most notorious state-sponsored cybercrime operations in the world. Following the 2024 attack, Alex Protocol partnered with prominent blockchain investigator ZachXBT to trace the stolen funds. The group had also worked with various analytics platforms and law enforcement agencies to identify wallet addresses involved in the theft, but full recovery of funds was never publicly confirmed. The recurrence of high-profile breaches raises alarm bells not only for Alex Protocol but also for the Stacks ecosystem, which aims to bring smart contract functionality and DeFi capabilities to the Bitcoin blockchain. With increased attention from regulators and investors alike, the pressure is mounting on DeFi platforms to drastically improve their security posture. Looking Ahead: Reputation on the Line For now, the Alex Lab Foundation’s swift pledge to reimburse users has helped ease the initial shock. But the long-term survival and reputation of the protocol will hinge on its ability to patch vulnerabilities, enhance internal security processes, and rebuild user confidence through transparency and strong governance. With over $12 million in total losses across two major attacks in just over a year, the platform faces an uphill battle. Whether it can bounce back will depend on how effectively it addresses both the technical shortcomings and the growing perception that it remains a soft target in an increasingly hostile DeFi landscape.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9492/cetus-and-alex-protocol-restore-services-following-major-exploits,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MINING|TRADING|SUI","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Analysts see potential for BTC to hit nearly $120K, but with RSI nearing 70, a short-term correction could be looming. Not the Peak the Bulls Expected Despite the retreat after hitting a new historical peak of almost $112,000 on May 22 , Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has been booming in the past several months. Currently, it is worth just over $107,000, representing a 53% increase on a yearly basis. The bull run coincides with the rising number of BTC holders, which, according to the crypto analytics platform, reached a new all-time high of 55.39 million. The development can be interpreted as an optimistic sign, as it indicates growing adoption and higher demand for the primary cryptocurrency. As crypto markets attempt to rally at the end of the work week, crypto networks continue to grow over time.

The X user Captain Faibik recently claimed that the valuation could surge to a new all-time high of over $113,000 should it break the resistance level of $105,700. CryptoBullet chipped in, too. They noted BTC’s recent resurgence above $107,000, suggesting that the price “is ready to go higher” and set a target of $119,000. On the other hand, investors should keep an eye on Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index, which neared overbought territory at almost 70. This signals that the asset’s valuation has increased too rapidly over a short period, which could be a precursor to a correction.

2025-06-09T11:35:07,"Europe’s first Bitcoin Treasury firm plans to raise $340m to buy more BTC","Adam Back-supported Bitcoin Treasury firm, Blockchain Group, wants to raise $340 million through ‘ATM-type’ shares as a way to raise capital with the intention of boosting its BTC holdings. In a recent press release , the Paris-based company declared that it will be partnering with asset manager TOBAM to raise capital to boost its Bitcoin ( BTC ) Treasury. By allowing TOBAM to subscribe to ordinary shares issued by Blockchain Group, the firm hopes to raise a total revenue of $340 million which they will use to boost its BTC holdings. “The Program allows TOBAM, on a daily basis, to subscribe to ordinary shares of the Company by submitting a subscription request after market close. Each request is subject to pricing and volume limits based on the market conditions,” wrote Blockchain Group. At press time, BTC has gone up by nearly 2% and is currently trading at $107,126. In the past week, BTC has gone up nearly 2.5%. If Blockchain Group does manage to raise $340 million, then it stands a chance to add more than 3171.46 BTC to its Bitcoin Treasury. The Blockchain Group currently owns a total of 1,471 BTC ($157.5 million), including 624 BTC acquired in a recent purchase and 847 BTC held previously. The program follows a structure called “At The Market” pricing, which is similar to the a model usually affiliated with U.S. companies. Instead of releasing all the shares into the market, Blockchain Group intends to sell shares directly at market prices, in tranches, and only under certain limits.

According to the press release, the company plans to sell the share price at a limit that’s either higher than the stock market closing price or at the volume weighted average price of the trading day before TOBAM’s request. Based on the company’s shareholder general meeting results, the firm has agreed to issue a maximum nominal amount of €500 million ($570 million) in nominal value. Although, the increase will only take place if it is authorized by the Blockchain Group’s board. Blockchain Group has adopted a Bitcoin accumulation strategy since November 2024, becoming the first European company to start a Bitcoin Treasury.

The final leg of the decline on June 5th saw over $875 million in long liquidations in a single day—highlighting the extent of deleveraging. With over $1.9 billion in total liquidations across the past week, leverage has now been forcefully reset. Technical structure shows that BTC’s ascent was underpinned by genuine demand, as shown by a spot-led stair-step rally , with key accumulation clusters forming at $93,000–96,000, and $102,000–104,000. On-chain indicators now point to rising sell pressure as older holders begin to distribute. The Spent Supply Distribution (SSD) quantiles and Short-Term Holder (STH) Cost Basis bands offer a clear roadmap. The SSD 0.95 quantile at $103,700 marks the first support zone, followed by $97,100 (STH Cost Basis) and $95,600 (SSD 0.85), with $83,200 as the key risk-off level. These levels are crucial as they reflect cost basis zones for large holders and recent buyers, serving as potential demand re-entry points or liquidation triggers. In a nutshell, Bitcoin is now at a crossroads—balanced between structural support and waning bullish momentum, waiting for its next macro cue. The US macroeconomic landscape continues to show signs of strain as job growth slowed in May, reflecting early pressure from ongoing trade tensions and tariff uncertainty. While wage gains remained solid, a shrinking labour force and downward revisions to past employment data suggest the labour market’s resilience is beginning to erode. At the same time, both the manufacturing and services sectors contracted , driven by rising input costs and declining demand, underscoring the widespread impact of tariffs across the economy. Construction spending has also declined for three straight months, and inflationary pressures are mounting as businesses struggle to absorb higher costs. On the trade front, the US deficit narrowed due to falling imports—particularly from China—but this decline signals weakening demand rather than strength, raising concerns about future inventory shortages and inflation. Meanwhile, investor appetite for long-term US debt is faltering , with auction data and futures markets pointing to skepticism about fiscal stability. Crypto adoption is accelerating on multiple fronts, with IG Group becoming the first UK-listed company to offer spot crypto trading to retail investors. Partnering with Uphold, IG now enables direct purchases of bitcoin and other tokens, marking a shift from speculative derivatives to true asset ownership. This move coincides with the UK Financial Conduct Authority’s proposal to lift its ban on crypto exchange-traded notes (cETNs) for retail investors, signalling broader regulatory support for digital assets. Meanwhile, Japan’s Metaplanet announced a ¥850 billion ($5.4 billion) equity raise to aggressively expand its bitcoin holdings, aiming for 210,000 BTC by 2027—underscoring Asia’s growing role in institutional crypto adoption.

2025-06-09T11:33:06,"“No need to go public:” Tether brushes off IPO talk post Circle debut","The public listing of USDC issuer Circle has raised questions about whether Tether could pursue an IPO of its own. In response, the latter has made its stance clear. According to recent comments by CEO Paolo Ardoino, Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin USDT, has no plans to go public. Ardoino shared the company’s position in a conversation on X, responding to questions about whether plans for an IPO might be in the works. “No need to go public,” Ardoino said . He further commented on a community member’s evaluation of what a potential Tether IPO could look like, estimating a $515 billion valuation based on the company’s reported profits.

This places Tether among the top 20 most valuable companies in the world, ahead of giants like Coca-Cola and Costco. Tether valuation at 515B is a beautiful number.

2025-06-09T11:30:37,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index Holds Firm at 62: Navigating the Greed Zone","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index Holds Firm at 62: Navigating the Greed Zone In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, understanding the prevailing mood of market participants can be as crucial as analyzing price charts. One popular tool for gauging this collective emotion is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . This index provides a simple snapshot of whether the market is leaning towards fear or greed, offering insights into potential shifts in momentum. What Exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, developed by Alternative.me, is designed to visualize the current crypto market sentiment . It aggregates various data sources to distill the overall feeling among crypto investors into a single number between 0 and 100. Think of it as a market mood ring. A value close to 0 indicates ‘Extreme Fear’. This often suggests investors are overly worried, potentially leading to panic selling. Historically, extreme fear periods can sometimes present buying opportunities for those with a higher risk tolerance. A value close to 100 indicates ‘Extreme Greed’. This typically means investors are overly optimistic, possibly experiencing FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), which can lead to excessive buying and potentially an overheated market ripe for a correction. The index serves as a temperature check, helping market participants understand the emotional state driving short-term price movements. Current Status: Holding Steady in the Greed Zone As of the latest update, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index stands at 62. Importantly, this reading remains unchanged from the previous day. This score places the index squarely in the ‘Greed’ zone. Staying at 62 indicates a consistent level of positive sentiment and buying interest in the market. While not in the ‘Extreme Greed’ territory (typically above 75), a reading of 62 still reflects a market where optimism is prevalent and participants are generally comfortable taking on more risk. What Factors Drive the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index isn’t just a random number; it’s calculated based on a weighted average of six key factors, each designed to capture different aspects of crypto market sentiment : Volatility (25%): This measures the current market’s price swings compared to average historical values. Higher volatility in an upward trend can indicate a greedy market, while high volatility during a downturn points to fear. It helps assess current crypto volatility levels. Market Momentum / Volume (25%): This factor looks at the current trading volume and market momentum compared to historical averages. High buying volume in a positive market suggests greed, while high selling volume indicates fear. Social Media (15%): This analyzes sentiment and engagement on social media platforms related to cryptocurrencies. Positive sentiment and high interaction often correlate with greed. Surveys (15%): While currently paused by Alternative.me, this component historically involved weekly sentiment surveys to gauge investor feelings directly. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin dominance measures Bitcoin’s market cap share relative to the total crypto market cap. An increasing Bitcoin dominance can sometimes signal fear (as investors flee altcoins to the perceived safety of Bitcoin), while decreasing dominance can indicate greed (as investors move funds into riskier altcoins hoping for higher returns). Google Trends (10%): This analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on Google Trends. Rising search interest, especially for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “crypto crash,” can indicate fear, while terms like “buy crypto” or specific coin names might suggest greed. By combining these diverse data points, the index aims to provide a more holistic view of the market’s emotional state. Understanding What the ‘Greed Zone’ Signifies Being in the greed zone , particularly at a level like 62, suggests several things about the current market environment: Optimism is High: Investors are generally feeling positive about the market’s prospects. Increased Buying Pressure: There is likely significant demand, potentially driven by positive news, price increases, or FOMO. Potential for Overextension: While not extreme, being in the upper half of the index suggests the market might be getting ahead of itself, increasing the risk of a sudden pullback or correction. FOMO is Present: The fear of missing out on potential gains can drive irrational buying behavior. It’s important to remember that ‘greed’ in this context isn’t necessarily a moral judgment, but rather a descriptor of the market’s collective emotional state and associated behavior patterns. Navigating the Greed Zone: Actionable Insights for Investors When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index sits comfortably in the greed zone , it’s a signal to approach the market with thoughtful consideration rather than impulsive action. Here are some actionable insights: Practice Caution: While the trend may be positive, a greedy market can reverse quickly. Avoid making decisions based purely on emotion or FOMO. Revisit Your Strategy: Use this time to review your investment plan. Are you sticking to your long-term goals, or are short-term gains tempting you to deviate? Consider Risk Management: High greed can coincide with increased crypto volatility . Ensure you have stop-loss orders in place or consider taking some profits if that aligns with your strategy. Focus on Fundamentals: Don’t let positive sentiment blind you to the underlying fundamentals of the projects you’re invested in. Avoid Leverage if Unexperienced: High greed periods can be particularly dangerous for leveraged trading due to potential sharp reversals. Look at Other Indicators: The index is just one tool. Combine its insights with technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and macro factors. Navigating a greedy market requires discipline. The goal is to avoid getting swept up in the euphoria and make rational decisions. Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a Crystal Ball? No, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is not a predictive tool. It doesn’t tell you where the price will go next. It’s a sentiment indicator, reflecting the *current* emotional state of the market based on historical patterns. Its value lies in highlighting potential extremes. When the index is at 80+ (Extreme Greed) or below 20 (Extreme Fear), it often correlates with significant market tops or bottoms, respectively. However, a mid-range greed score like 62 suggests a strong positive bias, but not necessarily an imminent crash. It’s a piece of the puzzle, not the whole picture. Conclusion: Keeping an Eye on Crypto Market Sentiment The fact that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index remains unchanged at 62, firmly within the greed zone , signals continued optimism and strong positive crypto market sentiment . While this reflects current upward momentum, it also serves as a reminder that caution is warranted in any market experiencing significant greed. Understanding the factors that influence the index, from crypto volatility to Bitcoin dominance , provides valuable context. By using the index as one of many tools in your analysis, you can gain a better perspective on the market’s emotional temperature and make more informed decisions when navigating the greed zone .

2025-06-09T11:22:31,"Why Cathie Wood Sees Bitcoin at $1.5 Million in Next 5 Years","The post Why Cathie Wood Sees Bitcoin at $1.5 Million in Next 5 Years appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood has made another bold call: Bitcoin could hit $1.5 million by 2030. That’s a 15x surge from its current price, and she says it’s not just a guess. It’s based on growing demand from some of the world’s biggest investors. Speaking on the YouTube show The Diary of a CEO , Wood laid out her reasons, pointing to a sharp rise in institutional interest and Bitcoin’s role as a new kind of financial asset. Institutional Investors Are Driving Bitcoin’s Rise Wood emphasized that large institutions are now entering the Bitcoin market in a big way. Companies like Arkham, Strategy, and Metaplanet are among the major names moving into BTC, signaling a shift in how traditional finance views crypto. She explained that Bitcoin’s volatility is decreasing as more investors hold it long-term. Compared to stocks, bonds, real estate, or commodities, Bitcoin behaves differently – making it a valuable tool for diversifying investment portfolios. Wood also noted that Bitcoin is unlike any asset we’ve seen since the introduction of equities in the 1600s. That makes it especially attractive to financial institutions managing trillions of dollars. Bitcoin’s Unique Role as a Diversifier Since Bitcoin doesn’t move in the same patterns as traditional assets, it’s catching the attention of institutional players looking for better ways to spread risk. Wood believes this unique quality is forcing big funds to take Bitcoin seriously, even those who were previously hesitant. According to her, institutional investors are only now realizing Bitcoin’s full potential, and they’re starting to act fast. Supply Is Shrinking While Demand Rises One of Wood’s key arguments is based on Bitcoin’s limited supply. Only about one million BTC remain to be mined, which translates to roughly $100 billion in new market value. That’s not much when you consider the trillions of dollars sitting in institutional funds. “There’s a lot of incremental demand, and someone’s going to have to sell,” she noted. She warned that this supply crunch is likely to drive prices much higher. As demand builds, someone will have to sell, creating strong upward pressure on price. 2025 Bull Run Fueled by Institutions This shift is already happening. Analysts at Matrixport found that Bitcoin’s recent rally to $111,814 was largely driven by institutions, not retail traders like in past bull markets. Supporting this trend, a report from Standard Chartered revealed that 61 corporate treasuries now hold a combined 3.2% of the total Bitcoin supply. Japan-based Metaplanet recently announced plans to acquire 210,000 BTC by 2027. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s company Strategy already holds 580,955 BTC – around 2.7% of all Bitcoin in circulation. Cathie Wood’s Top 10 Investment Picks In the same interview , Wood shared her top 10 investment picks. Tesla was her number one choice. She believes the company will bounce back despite its recent dip. Other names on her list included Coinbase, Robinhood, and Roku – further showing her preference for innovative, high-growth companies. ARK Invest Raises Its Target ARK Invest has also raised its long-term Bitcoin price target. In its April report, the firm projected a $2.4 million price by 2030 – if on-chain financial services continue growing at an annual rate of 60%. If these conditions hold, Wood believes Bitcoin is on track to become a major pillar of global finance. Final Thoughts? Cathie Wood’s $1.5 million Bitcoin prediction may seem extreme, but it’s backed by strong reasoning and market data. With institutional adoption rising and supply getting tighter, Bitcoin’s future could be even bigger than most expect. Bitcoin is no longer on the sidelines. It’s fast becoming a serious force in the world of finance.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-cathie-wood-sees-bitcoin-at-1-5-million-in-next-5-years/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ARKM","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-09T11:20:42,"Bitcoin Futures See Astonishing $1,490 Jump on CME Open","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Futures See Astonishing $1,490 Jump on CME Open Cryptocurrency markets are always buzzing, but sometimes specific events stand out, offering unique insights into market sentiment and potential future movements. One such event grabbing attention is the opening of Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). What Happened with CME Bitcoin Futures? Today’s open for Bitcoin futures on the CME showed a notable discrepancy compared to Friday’s close. Specifically, the futures contract opened at $106,550 on a four-hour chart. This open price was a significant $1,490 higher than the previous week’s closing price of $105,060. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as a ‘gap’ in trading, occurring when the opening price of an asset is considerably different from its previous closing price. In the case of CME Bitcoin futures , these gaps often form over the weekend when the traditional futures market is closed, but the underlying spot crypto market trades 24/7. The gap reflects the collective market sentiment and price movement that occurred while the CME futures were offline. Why Does a CME Gap Matter for the Bitcoin Price? The CME is a major regulated derivatives exchange, and its Bitcoin futures contracts are often seen as a bellwether for institutional interest and activity in the cryptocurrency space. Therefore, a significant gap up on the CME open is interpreted by many traders and analysts as a sign of strong buying pressure and positive sentiment accumulating over the weekend. It suggests that participants trading the underlying Bitcoin price on spot exchanges pushed the price up considerably during hours when the futures market was closed. Here are a few key takeaways from a significant CME gap up: Strong Momentum: It indicates that the bullish momentum from the previous week’s close carried through the weekend, or even accelerated. Institutional Sentiment: While not exclusively institutional, CME futures are heavily utilized by larger players. A gap suggests this cohort was net bullish over the weekend. Potential Price Magnet: Some traders believe that gaps, especially large ones, tend to get ‘filled’ eventually, meaning the price might revisit the levels within the gap. However, this is not guaranteed and can take varying amounts of time. Understanding Futures Trading and the Crypto Market Futures trading involves contracts to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price at a specific time in the future. For Bitcoin futures on the CME, this allows participants to speculate on the future Bitcoin price without owning the underlying asset directly. The existence and activity on platforms like CME add liquidity and different types of participants to the broader crypto market ecosystem. While the spot market for Bitcoin trades continuously, the CME futures market has specific trading hours (typically Sunday evening to Friday afternoon in the US). This difference in trading hours is precisely why these gaps can occur. When the spot market makes a large move outside of CME hours, the futures contract has to open at a price reflecting this new reality, creating the gap. Challenges and Opportunities Presented by CME Gaps Opportunities: A gap up can confirm bullish sentiment for traders looking for entry points or validation of long positions. Aggressive traders might try to trade the gap itself, betting on it filling or continuing in the direction of the gap. Challenges: Gaps can be volatile areas. Prices can quickly move to ‘fill’ the gap, potentially leading to losses for those positioned incorrectly. Predicting whether and when a gap will fill is difficult and adds an element of uncertainty. False signals can occur; sometimes gaps are quickly reversed. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Market For those participating in the crypto market , monitoring CME Bitcoin futures opens is a useful practice. While not the only factor influencing the Bitcoin price , a significant gap provides immediate insight into weekend sentiment. Traders often look at the size of the gap and the subsequent price action after the open to gauge the strength of the move. Will the price consolidate, continue moving higher, or start to retrace and fill the gap? Keeping an eye on charts, understanding market structure, and combining this information with other technical and fundamental analysis is crucial when interpreting events like this CME gap. It serves as a reminder that the market is a dynamic environment, constantly reacting to news, sentiment, and trading activity across various platforms. Conclusion: A Bullish Signal to Start the Week? The $1,490 gap higher on the CME Bitcoin futures open is a clear indication of robust buying activity during the weekend. It injects a dose of positive sentiment into the start of the trading week for the crypto market . While gaps present both opportunities and risks, this specific gap up signals that market participants were eager to buy Bitcoin at higher prices even when the traditional futures market was closed. How the Bitcoin price reacts in the coming hours and days will be key to understanding if this bullish signal has lasting power.

Investors are shifting focus to utility-driven tokens with long-term growth potential. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) is the first ICO on Bitcoin, offering meme coin energy with real infrastructure utility. With $14m raised and major Tier-1 exchange listings on the horizon, BPEP is gaining massive traction. The crypto market is heating up in June 2025 as Bitcoin gears up for its next big bull run. Investor mood is clearly shifting—more folks are now chasing projects that solve real problems and promise long-term growth. Astute investors are pivoting to crypto projects that offer actual utility and high ROI. With continuously increasing adoption from major institutions, government, and retailers, a new class of strong utility crypto projects is poised for breakout success. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) , the first ICO on Bitcoin, is leading the best crypto presales pack with its unique infrastructure that addresses Bitcoin’s speed and scalability limitations. Experts are calling BPEP a leveraged bet on Bitcoin, and with predictions of BTC reaching $1 million in the next few years, Bitcoin Pepe could be the biggest opportunity of the decade. With immense investor support, the project has already raised over $14m. Bitcoin Pepe now allows investors to enjoy both Bitcoin’s long-term growth and security, as well as an explosive price surge like meme coins. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP): Best crypto presale to buy before major listing Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) is emerging as a dark horse in the presale sector thanks to its blockbuster presale success and an efficient blockchain architecture. Bitcoin holders have been missing out on the lucrative gains of altcoins because Bitcoin faces technical difficulties like speed and scalability, which drive the performance of meme coins and viral tokens. Finally, Bitcoin Pepe has cracked it with its revolutionary PEP-20 standard token, which brings Bitcoin a speed of over 1000 TPS and enables the launch of meme coins on its $2 trillion dormant liquidity. Expert developers are calling it “Solana on Bitcoin” as it repeats a similar supercycle to Solana on the Bitcoin network. Now, for the first time, anyone can launch tokens natively on Bitcoin with the help of the PEP-20 token, essentially bringing the entire meme ecosystem to Bitcoin's foundation. Furthermore, the BPEP team's upcoming launch announcement on June 17th is generating immense excitement. Word on the street is that the BPEP token might be landing on some top-tier exchanges imminently. Recently, some development images were leaked, further fueling the community's excitement and demand for the token. Sitting at $0.0396 in its final presale stages, BPEP is just days away from a mega announcement and probably an exchange debut. Major Tier 1 listings are already locked in, big money's already piling in, and even Bitcoin holders are jumping on board—finally getting in on the viral trading action without giving up the security they count on. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum has always been the backbone of altcoin innovation, leading the market with its innovative blockchain infrastructure. Currently, it is the second-biggest cryptocurrency, with a market cap of $299 billion, serving users from DeFi and NFTs to the meme coins retail traders can’t get enough of. After a consistent downtrend for three months, the Ethereum price has finally broken out of the bearish rally. On Sunday, it took support from the lower support of the consolidation pattern. However, due to erratic volatility, the Ethereum price has again dropped to $2,485, which is nearly the same support. Source: TradingView Once the Ethereum price decisively breaks from the local resistance of $2,800, it could invalidate the consolidation and form a trend rally. If the upside break comes with increased volume, it could mean the Ethereum price is ready to touch $3,000. Ripple (XRP) The recent XRP price action shows investors are cautious after falling below a critical support level. Ripple is currently at $2.22, after a correction from a high of $2.65. While investors enjoy a positive weekly trend, long-term holders remain cautious about recent monthly performance. The Ripple price is consolidating close to the $2.00 support level after a steady decline over the last few days. The altcoin price soared to $2.65 during the market pump. By this time, Ripple’s appeal was previously driven by its capabilities within the traditional financial sector and cross-border payments. However, market sentiment has changed due to ongoing regulatory challenges. As a result, investors are reconsidering their portfolios and going toward early-stage investments that may offer stronger potential. Smart positioning in the best crypto presales opportunities The cryptocurrency market is full of opportunities, but timing the projects in their early stages is as important as picking the right one. Bitcoin Pepe's coming listing is when the market is in a strong rebound position, solidifying its position as the best cryptocurrency available. Among the top contenders, BPEP is particularly compelling due to a revolutionary platform addressing a $2 trillion market and a presale that has already raised over $14m. Bitcoin Pepe checks all the boxes that today’s astute investor looks for: mind-blowing utility, revolutionary tech, and community backing. It’s not just an ordinary crypto project; it's a market-ready solution. Visit the official Bitcoin Pepe website to secure tokens before the June 17 announcement moons the price.

As debt surges, more of it needs to be refinanced, which means more bond buyers are needed, which puts pressure on the bond markets. On June 6, the Financial Times reported that investor demand for long-term government debt is weakening, as evidenced by recent auctions of 20-year bonds in Japan and the US, which were poorly received, triggering sharp price drops and rising yields. Prominent investors such as BlackRock’s Larry Fink and billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio warned of unsustainable deficits, especially in the US, which is considering a $2.4 trillion debt increase, prompting fears of a path to insolvency. Long-term bond yields serve as benchmarks for corporate debt, and higher yields will raise borrowing costs for businesses, risking growth. Additionally, a debt market dominated by hedge funds and short-term players may become more volatile. Bitcoin The Beneficiary Store-of-value assets like Bitcoin could benefit significantly from the unfolding global bond market strain and loss of faith in sovereign debt. If government debt becomes less attractive due to high yields, poor auction performance, and credit rating downgrades, investors may seek alternatives to store capital. Governments may also increasingly rely on inflation to erode the real value of debt, and BTC has often been considered an inflation hedge. Being non-sovereign and decentralized, Bitcoin also offers a parallel financial system that is immune to political manipulation or debt monetization. As countries and investors diversify away from US Treasuries and the dollar, Bitcoin could also be part of a new neutral reserve asset basket, especially in emerging markets.

2025-06-09T11:15:00,"Crypto Daybook Americas: Bitcoin Options Point to Gains as Bullish Flow Builds Ahead of CPI Data","By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin BTC rose over the weekend, offering a reprieve after a week of market jitters. It is now trading around $106,600 after gaining 1.2% in the past 24 hours, while the broader CoinDesk 20 ( CD20 ) index added nearly 1.7%. The recovery appeared driven less by headlines and more their absence, marking a shift from the public feud between U.S. President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk that rattled investors. As tensions cooled, markets recovered. Even developments that might be seen as negative did not appear to sway markets. These include Taiwan-based crypto exchange BitoPro confirming being hacked , and data from Blockchain.com showing a slowdown in BTC’s network activity to the lowest level in a year. Meanwhile, the Hang Seng index jumped 1.6% as traders reacted to U.S. President Donald Trump expressing optimism for talks with China in London that start today, saying the meeting “should go very well.” Still, concerns are mounting over deflation in China. Consumer prices fell 0.1% year-over-year in May and factory gate prices dropped 3.3%, the steepest decline since October 2022. The People's Bank of China has already responded by trimming interest rates, reducing reserve requirements, and injecting liquidity into the market. That may eventually benefit cryptocurrencies, which often trade in tandem with liquidity conditions in traditional markets. All that may recede in importance on Wednesday, when the U.S. announces the latest inflation figures. May’s consumer price index report is expected to show a rise in core inflation to 2.9%, up from 2.8% in April. A stronger-than-expected reading could delay the Federal Reserve’s next rate cut and inject volatility across financial markets. In a note published Monday, Spanish bank Bankinter warned that rising inflation and U.S. bond yields could pressure equity valuations and weaken the ""fear of missing out"" momentum that’s been propping up global stocks and other risk assets. The yield on the 10-year Treasury has already climbed to 4.5%, a level that could begin to weigh on market sentiment if inflation surprises to the upside. Crypto markets, for now, are caught in the crossfire. Stay alert!

The Token Generation Event (TGE) marks the public debut of the token, with listings on Binance Alpha, Bybit and MEXC. Formerly known as Range Protocol, Skate is building a framework that allows decentralized applications (dapps) to run across multiple virtual machines like Ethereum, Solana and TON without needing separate deployments. The token lies at the heart of the system, supporting governance, staking and liquidity provision through the network’s automated market maker (AMM). Out of a fixed 1 billion token supply, 10% is being distributed via airdrops to early users, ecosystem contributors and NFT campaign participants. Claiming and staking the tokens immediately may boost rewards by 30%. MEXC’s pre-market trading started on June 4, with prices initially jumping 33% to $0.20 before dropping back down to $0.12 at the time of writing. Derivatives Positioning BTC options open interest on Deribit is $32.9B, with calls significantly outweighing puts at 200,000 contracts versus 110,000. The put/call volume ratio stands at 0.54, indicating continued demand for upside exposure. The $140K strike leads all others with 16,100 calls open, representing $1.79B in notional value. The 27 June expiry is the main focal point, accounting for $13.1B in notional open interest or 41% of the total. Daily notional flow is highest at this expiry with $206M traded, followed by $194M at the 13 June expiry. Monday flow data from Deribit shows 31% of contracts were calls bought and 17% were puts bought. The rest of the activity came from call and put selling, suggesting traders are combining bullish positioning with yield strategies at higher strikes. Coinglass liquidation heatmaps show high concentrations of long leverage near $104K and $107K. A total of $39M in liquidation leverage is stacked around $104.7K, making it a key downside level to watch for potential forced selling. Funding rates from Velo are steady, with BTC annualized funding holding near 6.2%. This reflects a moderately bullish stance, with no signs of excessive leverage in perpetual markets.

Price action has broken out of the downward trendline, signaling a potential shift in momentum. However, it remains within a key daily order block, which may act as resistance. For a bullish continuation, it's crucial for the BTC price to hold above these reclaimed EMAs and secure a weekly close above $109,400, which would invalidate the current weekly swing failure pattern and confirm the cryptocurrency's strength.

2025-06-09T11:10:40,"Mexico’s President Slams Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ Over 3.5% Remittance Tax","The post Mexico’s President Slams Trump’s ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ Over 3.5% Remittance Tax appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Mexico’s President, Claudia Sheinbaum, has strongly condemned U.S. President Donald Trump’s controversial ‘ Big Beautiful Bill’ , which proposes a 3.5% tax on remittances sent by immigrants to their home countries. Sheinbaum labeled the bill unfair and vowed that Mexico would stand united in opposition . Big Beautiful Bill Sparks Fresh Tensions Between U.S. and Mexico Despite revisions from an earlier 15% tax proposal, the new 3.5% remittance tax remains a flashpoint between the two nations. Sheinbaum warned that the bill could have severe repercussions on Mexican immigrants working in the U.S., calling it an unjust move to block money flowing back to families in Mexico. She stated that Mexican officials are staying alert , anticipating the hardships this bill could trigger. Mexico Mobilizes Against the Remittance Tax In May, Sheinbaum expressed firm opposition, saying : “Mexican citizens in America work hard to pay their bills. We don’t want this tax to affect the remittances of our countrymen, who tend to the needy.” She urged Mexicans to write letters and emails to the U.S. Senate, emphasizing that Mexico will mobilize if necessary to defend the interests of its people. She also revealed an upcoming countermeasure: an alternative bill named ‘Finabien’ , aimed at reducing fees on future remittances. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : U.S. CPI Report to Decide Crypto’s Next Move – Will the Fed Hold Back? , U.S. Senator Escalates Tensions With Sharp Remarks Missouri Senator Eric Schmitt intensified the dispute, dismissing Mexico’s concerns and suggesting an even harsher version of the bill . In a recent social media post, Schmitt stated : “I’m introducing legislation to quadruple the proposed remittance tax — from 3.5% to 15%. America is not the world’s piggy bank. And we don’t take kindly to threats.” He claimed the U.S. is not a “shopping mall” for Mexico and vowed to push the bill forward. What’s Next? Crypto Emerges as a Lifeline for Mexico Amid growing concerns, crypto may become a workaround for Mexicans facing the new remittance tax. Experts point out that unhosted crypto wallets make it harder for U.S. authorities to track or tax cross-border transactions.Analysts now describe crypto as a potential lifeline for Mexican immigrants , providing a decentralized alternative to bypass future financial restrictions. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-09T11:05:08,"4 U.S. Economic Reports This Week That Could Make or Break Bitcoin","The post 4 U.S. Economic Reports This Week That Could Make or Break Bitcoin appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News If you’re watching crypto charts this week, you’ll want to keep one eye on Washington. A powerful lineup of U.S. economic data is set to roll out – Consumer Price Index (CPI), Initial Jobless Claims, Producer Price Index (PPI), and Consumer Sentiment. For traders, this could be a narrative shift. Each release could send Bitcoin into motion, depending on how the market reads the Fed’s next step. As of now, Bitcoin is hovering near $105,448, nearly flat on the day. That could change fast. CPI Sets the Tone It all kicks off on Wednesday with the May CPI report, arguably the most influential macro event for markets this week. CPI is the Fed’s go-to gauge on inflation, and for crypto investors, it’s a litmus test for rate cut prospects. Economists are expecting a small uptick: Core CPI is projected to rise 0.3% after April’s 0.2%. Annual inflation might edge up to 2.5%, according to MarketWatch , which would interrupt the recent cooling trend. That’s a delicate line. If inflation continues to ease, it could signal a more flexible Fed and renew appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. On the flip side, if inflation runs hotter – even slightly – the Fed may have to stay cautious. That could mean holding off on rate cuts, or worse, tightening further. And markets won’t like that. Andrea Lisi of Lisi Quant Analysis put it plainly: “I believe it’s premature to expect a meaningful uptick in core CPI… I anticipate the earliest signals of rising inflation to emerge in July.” Still, in crypto, timing is everything. A 2.5% print might not panic the Fed, but it could shake expectations and that’s where volatility lives. Jobless Claims Next up: Thursday’s Initial Jobless Claims report. Normally a footnote, this one’s gaining weight. With inflation appearing sticky, the labor market is now taking center stage in shaping Fed policy. Jobless claims from last week came in at 247,000, and economists are forecasting a slight drop to 242,000. That’s after May’s Non-Farm Payrolls came in stronger than expected. But if claims unexpectedly rise, that could mark the beginning of a softer labor market – a development that historically boosts Bitcoin. Why? Because weaker jobs data tends to fuel rate cut hopes, which can soften the dollar and drive capital into higher-risk assets. Bitcoin doesn’t just follow tech stocks anymore. It’s increasingly reacting to macro cues and jobless claims have quietly become one of them. PPI: Inflation’s Early Warning System Also due Thursday, the Producer Price Index is often overshadowed by CPI, but it shouldn’t be. PPI reflects wholesale prices and often gives the first signal of where inflation is headed. April’s data showed annual PPI at 2.4%, down from 3.4% in March. If that trend holds, it may reinforce the idea that inflation is cooling across the supply chain – a bullish backdrop for Bitcoin. As one trader noted on X , CPI and PPI combined “should give us a very good idea as to what we’re going to see with PCE prices at the end of the month.” In other words, this week’s data may set the tone not just for June, but for Q3 positioning. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market News Today: BTC, ETH & Top 10 Cryptos Consolidate, While KAIA and AB Lead the Markets , Consumer Sentiment: The Mood That Moves Markets Finally, Friday’s Consumer Sentiment report gives us something markets often underestimate – how regular people are feeling. The May reading dropped to 52.2, one of the lowest on record. Expectations for June are modestly higher at 55.0, but still deeply pessimistic by historical standards. If sentiment drops further, it could add pressure on the Fed to act, boosting the outlook for assets like Bitcoin. A stronger-than-expected print, however, might tell a different story, suggesting resilience and delaying any policy easing. Sentiment data doesn’t usually make headlines. This week, it should. Why This Week Feels Different Bitcoin is no stranger to volatility. But this week, it’s not about ETFs, miners, or memecoins – it’s about macro data, policy shifts, and the recalibration of investor risk. When inflation, jobs, wholesale prices, and consumer confidence all land in the same week, it sets the backdrop for Bitcoin’s next directional move. The Fed may not be speaking this week. But these numbers? They’re saying plenty. We’ll keep you updated right here on Coinpedia.

About a third of all top 100 coins have seen their prices increase over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency market capitalization has decreased by 1.9% to $3.41 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $71.9 billion, decreasing over the past few days. TLDR: After a brief rise, most coins record additional decreases; The market still moves within the typical post-ATH pullback area; BTC is largely unchanged in a day, moving within the $105,000 zone; There is still a chance for BTC to hit $136,000 by the year’s end; US spot BTC ETFs breaks brief inflow streak, spot ETH ETFs record a fifteen-day inflow streak; The dip is expected but may go lower still. Crypto Winners & Losers Looking at the top 10 coins per market cap, we find four up and four down (excluding the two stablecoins), but with minimal changes over the past 24 hours. At the time of writing, Bitcoin (BTC) has increased by 0.1%, meaning it’s unchanged, currently trading at $105,660. Ethereum (ETH) decreased by 0.9%, now changing hands at $2,492. This is also a slight fall from the intraday high of $2,537. The category’s highest gainer is XRP , which increased by 0.9% to $2.24, while the biggest drop is Dogecoin (DOGE)’s 1.3% to the price of $0.1818. Notably, XRP has joined the Nasdaq Crypto US Settlement Price Index . This is a significant move that brings more institutions to XRP and vice versa.

On Friday, the price bounced off the overnight lows, but the CIO didn’t think this corrective move lower was done. “I expect that wave (ii) pullback will complete in the $88,000 to $93,000 region before the next leg up. This corrective move should finish in mid-to-late summer, followed by an impulsive wave (iii) higher, so if you’re looking to add, the wave (ii) target is a good level,” Glover argued. He added, however, that wave (i) can be completely retraced by wave (ii), so a retest of the $74,500 low of Wave IV is “not out of the question. But my expectations continue to be for a rally to $133,000-$136,000 into the end of this year/beginning of next.” Source: Ledn Meanwhile, per TradingView , Bitcoin’s exchange review has fallen to a record low of 2.3 million on centralized exchanges. This is the result of institutional buying and an increase in spot ETFs, limiting BTC supply. Dom Harz, the co-founder of Layer-2 BOB , also noted that this is the lowest reserves level since 2018, pointing to growing investor confidence in BTC’s long-term future, including as a strategic asset. “But the question remains, what’s next? Will billions in capital sit idle in treasuries and wallets for years to come? We would suggest this is unlikely. With this scale of investment, it’s only natural that holders, both institutions and individuals, will want to put their Bitcoin to work,” Harz says. “Thankfully, appetite for sustainable BTC yield is on a collision course with technical breakthroughs that will truly unlock secure, scalable Bitcoin DeFi. The next era of finance isn’t theoretical anymore, it’s already taking shape.” Why Is Crypto Down Today: Levels & Events to Watch Next BTC currently trades at $105,660, managing to hold the $105,000 level after several failed attempts last week. This is a pullback from the intraday high of $106,352. Compared to its all-time high of $111,814, the coin is down 5.5%.

It stands at 55 today . This level indicates investor caution in the market. This may drop into the fear range. Meanwhile, on 6 June, US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded a net outflow of $47.82 million , with BlackRock alone bleeding $130.49 million. The two-day outflow streak has broken the brief, two-day inflow streak. At the same time, US ETH spot ETFs have continued the inflows streak of fifteen consecutive days, gaining another $25.22 million. BlackRock leads this list with $15.86 million. Notably, despite the recent crypto market pullback, major TradFi players are still entering the space. The stablecoin space has seen significant interest lately. One of the latest examples is Deutsche Bank , which is e xploring stablecoins and tokenized deposit solutions to modernize payments. The bank is considering its options: issuing its own stablecoin or participating in a broader industry initiative, per Sabih Behzad, the head of digital assets and currencies transformation.

While the crypto market recorded a wide, albeit minor decrease over the past 24 hours, the stock market saw an increase overall on Friday. Monday data is not yet available. On Friday, the S&P 500 increased by 1.03%, the Nasdaq-100 is up 0.99%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 1.05%. Stocks reacted to the monthly labor market report, which indicated resilience amid concerns about the impact of US President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Is this dip sustainable? It still seems that the ongoing dip is a part of a usual pullback following a BTC all-time high. The coin is currently attempting to hold higher levels, but the analysts stress that the market overall is at a junction – positive moves could provide a significant boost, but negative news could lead to a bearish pull-down as well.

2025-06-09T11:00:49,"Bitcoin Transaction Activity: Why the Surprising 19-Month Low Matters","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Transaction Activity: Why the Surprising 19-Month Low Matters Hey crypto enthusiasts! Have you noticed things feeling a little quieter on the Bitcoin front lately? It turns out that feeling is backed up by data. Recent reports show that Bitcoin transaction activity has dipped significantly, reaching a low not seen in over a year and a half. Let’s dive into what this means for the Bitcoin network and the broader landscape. According to data from The Block, the seven-day moving average (7DMA) of Bitcoin transactions has fallen to 316,720 as of June 6th. This marks a 19-month low, the lowest level since October 2023, when the 7DMA touched 269,000. This metric gives us a smoother view of network usage, ironing out daily spikes and dips to show underlying trends. A sustained drop like this suggests a notable shift in how people are interacting with the chain. Understanding the Dip in Bitcoin Transaction Activity So, why the slowdown? Several factors could be contributing to this decrease in Bitcoin transaction activity : Reduced Ordinals/Inscriptions Volume: A major driver of high transaction counts in the past year was the boom in Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens. As the initial hype cools or activity shifts to other chains or Layer 2 solutions, the number of these specific transactions decreases. Market Consolidation: Following significant price movements, markets often enter periods of consolidation. During such times, traders and investors might be holding assets rather than actively moving them, leading to fewer transactions. Shift to Layer 2 Solutions: While the core network sees a dip, some activity might be moving to Layer 2 scaling solutions like the Lightning Network, which aren’t always reflected in the main chain transaction count. Increased Transaction Fees (Historically): Although fees have recently been lower, periods of high fees earlier in the year might have discouraged smaller transactions, potentially establishing a trend of fewer, larger movements. This isn’t necessarily a sign of trouble, but rather an indicator of evolving usage patterns on the Bitcoin network . What Does Lower Blockchain Activity Mean? A dip in Blockchain activity , specifically on Bitcoin, has several implications: Lower Fees for Users: With less congestion, the competition for block space decreases, resulting in lower transaction fees. This is a direct benefit for users who need to move Bitcoin. Impact on Miners: Transaction fees are a significant part of miner revenue, especially as the block subsidy halves over time. Lower fee volume means miners rely more heavily on the block reward, potentially impacting profitability for less efficient operations. Network Congestion: Less activity means less congestion, potentially leading to faster confirmation times for standard transactions, even those with lower fees. User Behavior Insight: It can indicate whether users are primarily in ‘accumulation’ or ‘distribution’ phases, or simply utilizing the network less for speculative or inscription-based activities. While high activity often signals growth and demand, lower activity isn’t inherently negative; it can sometimes point to increased efficiency or a shift in how the network is being used. The Developer’s Perspective: Encouraging Bitcoin Transactions Interestingly, in light of this slowdown, several Bitcoin Core developers issued a statement. They encouraged nodes (the computers that validate and relay transactions) to continue relaying low-fee and non-standard transactions. Why is this important? Nodes play a crucial role in the network’s decentralization and censorship resistance. By relaying all valid transactions, regardless of fee amount or type (as long as miners are willing to include them in blocks), they ensure that the network remains open and accessible to everyone. Discouraging the relay of certain transaction types could inadvertently lead to centralization or make the network less permissionless for specific use cases. This developer statement highlights the ongoing effort to maintain the core principles of the Bitcoin network even as usage patterns fluctuate and new types of Bitcoin transactions emerge. Looking Ahead: What Could Boost Crypto Market Trends and Bitcoin Transactions? Predicting future Crypto market trends and network activity is always challenging, but several factors could lead to an increase in Bitcoin transactions again: Renewed Market Bull Run: Significant upward price movement often correlates with increased on-chain activity as people buy, sell, and move assets. Novel Use Cases: Development of new applications or protocols built on or interacting with Bitcoin could drive transaction volume. Increased Adoption: Broader institutional or retail adoption, especially for payments or transfers, would naturally lead to more transactions. Protocol Upgrades: Future Bitcoin protocol improvements could impact transaction types or efficiency, potentially influencing volume. While the current dip is notable, the underlying infrastructure of the Bitcoin network remains robust, ready to handle increased activity when it returns. Actionable Insights from the Current Bitcoin Transaction Activity For those navigating the current environment, here are a few takeaways: Users: Take advantage of lower transaction fees if you need to move Bitcoin. Understand that confirmation times are likely faster for standard transactions right now. Miners: Monitor the balance between block subsidy and transaction fees. Network activity directly impacts your revenue stream. Developers & Node Operators: The call from core developers underscores the importance of maintaining node decentralization and relaying diverse transaction types to support the network’s open nature. Understanding these metrics helps us gauge the pulse of the Bitcoin network and its current phase. Conclusion: Navigating the Quiet Period on the Bitcoin Network The dip in Bitcoin transaction activity to a 19-month low is a significant data point, reflecting shifts in network usage, potentially influenced by factors like reduced Ordinals activity and market dynamics. While it results in lower fees and impacts miner revenue, it also highlights the network’s ability to adapt and provides a period of less congestion. The encouragement from core developers to continue relaying all transaction types reinforces the commitment to Bitcoin’s foundational principles of decentralization and censorship resistance. As Crypto market trends evolve, monitoring on-chain data like transaction counts remains essential for understanding the health and usage patterns of the Bitcoin network .

Here Are the Cryptocurrencies with the Most Inflows","According to the latest data from CoinShares, digital asset investment products recorded net inflows of $224 million last week, marking the seventh consecutive week of positive inflows, bringing the total for this period to $11 billion. Ethereum Dominates Digital Asset Flows Amid Policy Uncertainty and Bitcoin’s Continual Outflows However, the pace of inflows slowed as investors remained cautious as they awaited key policy signals from the US Federal Reserve. Ethereum finished the week as the leader with $296.4 million in inflows, showing its strongest performance since the US elections in November 2024. Ethereum has recorded $1.5 billion in inflows over the past seven weeks, accounting for 10.5% of total assets under management (AUM). This represents a significant recovery in investor sentiment towards Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. In contrast, Bitcoin saw $56.5 million in outflows, the second straight week of losses. Short Bitcoin investment products also saw small outflows, reflecting waning interest in bearish bets as the market awaits greater clarity on inflation and interest rate decisions. Altcoins remained relatively calm. Sui (SUI) saw a modest inflow of $1.1 million, while XRP continued the negative sentiment with an outflow of $6.6 million, extending its withdrawal streak to a third week. Regional Distribution Entries were widely distributed across regions: United States: $175 million Germany: $47.8 million Switzerland: $15.7 million Canada: $9.8 million Australia: $6.5 million Meanwhile, Brazil (-$9.2 million) and Hong Kong (-$14.6 million) saw small increases, with Hong Kong seeing a sharp reversal after record inflows. The slowdown in inflows reflects increased investor caution amid macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly as the Federal Reserve's next move on interest rates looms. Analysts suggest that despite the recovery in sentiment towards Ethereum, the overall market may remain in a holding mode until inflation and interest rate expectations become clearer. Despite these headwinds, the continued weekly inflows highlight the resilience of institutional interest in digital assets even in a fragile macroeconomic environment. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-09T10:54:09,"The Upcoming Meta $10B AI Investment Is Promising for AI Coins","Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta is pushing for another major milestone in the AI sector, with a massive $10B investment. According to a Bloomberg report, Meta is in talks with Scale AI, looking for a bill of $10B . This would be Meta’s largest investment to date and one of the largest tags associated with a private company. Scale AI is a major player in the AI industry, currently valued at over $13.8B, based on their recent Series F funding . The company also racked in approximately $860M in revenue in 2024 and is projected to reach $2B in 2025. Let’s discuss why Meta’s $10B AI investment is promising for AI coins, especially overachieving ones like SUBBD Token ($SUBBD). Meta’s Interest in Scale AI is Part of a Global Trend in AI Adoption While Meta’s upcoming $10B investment is hitting the news hard, this isn’t the first time that the company has dipped its toes into the AI sector. Llama 3 and, more recently, Llama 4, are advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) that represent one of Meta’s most important breakthroughs in this sector. Llama 4 is especially noteworthy, along with its two models, Scout and Maverick, as it comes with ‘superior text and industry-leading intelligence.’ Meta’s interest in Scale AI makes sense from two perspectives. The first is the fact that Meta and Scale AI have a history together (given Scale AI’s Defense Llama, built based on Meta’s Llama 3). Scale AI’s trademark LLM has military applications and: ‘Was trained on a vast dataset, including military doctrine, international humanitarian law, and relevant policies designed to align with the Department of Defense (DoD) guidelines for armed conflict as well as the DoD’s Ethical Principles for Artificial Intelligence.’ —The Scale Team, Defense Llama: The LLM Purpose-Built for American National Security The second perspective links to the growing trend of global AI adoption, with several noteworthy mentions: Sam Altman’s World has produced Orb, the AI-based eye-scanning tool designed to counter deepfakes and is currently available in 1,500+ public locations worldwide The Stargate Project has Arm, Microsoft, OpenAi, Oracle, and Nvidia investing in a $500B project over the next four years to build a new AI infrastructure in the US Elon Musk’s generative AI startup, xAI , raised $6B in May, 2024, from investors like Tribe Capital, Sequoia Capital, and Lightspeed Venture Partners Amazon spent $19B on AI data centers in 2024, but plans to bump that price tag to $100B in 2025 To end on a high note, Zuckerberg himself declared that he expects Meta AI to become an industry-leading force, with Llama 4 as the tip of the spear. This is why Meta is planning a massive $60-$65B investment in Capital Expenditures (CapEx) in 2025. All this means that we should expect an explosive 2025 for AI coins and the crypto market as a whole. Especially in the presale sector, where we can sometimes find innovative projects that exploit exciting market niches. One such project is SUBBD Token ($SUBBD). SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – AI-Driven Project Designed to Streamline the Content Creation Process SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is an AI-driven platform that aims to improve creators’ post-production workflow. This allows them to focus more on producing more and better-quality content and create more meaningful relationships with their fans. With SUBBD, content creators can not only produce more content, but can token-gate exclusive content as well, and even develop entire online personas thanks to specialized native AI agents. For instance, the AI Creator lets you produce and monetize your own digital influencer, lowering the entry level into the content creation industry. The project is currently in presale, having accumulated over $631K so far, with a token price of $0.055625. Considering that SUBBD Token has already onboarded 2,000+ of the top earning creators, with a combined following of 250M+, and based on its long-term utility and vision , we believe that the altcoin will become a staple in the content creation industry. Our analysts predict a price point for $SUBBD of $0.301 by the end of 2025. This translates to an ROI of 441% at the current price. With increased post-launch adoption and continuous development, we could be looking at a price point of $2.50 by the end of 2030. This will turn your $100 investment into $5,000 for an ROI of 4,934%. These numbers, if they’ll come true in the months to come, would make $SUBBD one of the best presales of 2025 . You can buy SUBBD Token through the presale page of via Best Wallet . Meta’s AI Move Could Flare Up Huge Investor Interest With the AI sector increasingly overlapping the crypto market, Meta’s coming $10B investment not only makes sense, but it seems unavoidable. This would place Meta in the same boat as other big tech, like Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia, which are already neck-deep in the AI pool. This is good news for projects like SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) , which aim to innovate underdeveloped niches like AI-based content creation. Don’t take this as financial advice.

2025-06-09T10:52:00,"Bitcoin Price Could Explode After June 11 CPI Report, Says Analyst","The post Bitcoin Price Could Explode After June 11 CPI Report, Says Analyst appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin could be on the verge of a massive breakout, according to popular crypto analyst Doctor Profit , who predicts a potential price surge of up to 170% in the coming months. With a Golden Cross formation , key support near $100K , and a pivotal CPI inflation report just days away, the market may be heading for explosive gains. Bitcoin Eyes Breakout as Key Resistance Is Tested At the start of June, Bitcoin was trading at $104,588.85, but briefly dipped 4.10% between June 3–5. However, it bounced back sharply from $100,400 on June 6 , rising 2.74% in a single day. Since then, BTC has gained another 5.07% , currently sitting around $106,663.68. Doctor Profit shared on X (formerly Twitter) that Bitcoin is attempting to break a diagonal resistance line —a move he believes could launch BTC into a new all-time high soon . “A confirmed Golden Cross and strong $100K support signal a bullish breakout. BTC could rise 70–170% if macro factors align,” he wrote. Why CPI Inflation Data Could Make or Break BTC Rally All eyes are on the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data release scheduled for June 11, 2025 . In April, CPI rose from 319.799 to 320.795 points. This month, it’s projected to reach 321.9 , according to TEForecast. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : U.S. CPI Report to Decide Crypto’s Next Move – Will the Fed Hold Back? , More importantly, the U.S. inflation rate , which dropped to 2.3% in April, is expected by Wall Street to rise slightly to 2.5% . However, Doctor Profit believes the number could surprise to the downside —possibly between 2.1% and 2.3% . A lower-than-expected CPI could spark optimism, increasing chances of a Fed rate cut —a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin. Next Bitcoin Price Target: $108K–$110K? Doctor Profit also notes a liquidity cluster between $108K and $110K , which may be BTC’s next short-term target before a bigger breakout. If Bitcoin pushes through that zone, it could open the path for a sustained rally. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The Blockchain Group @_ALTBG · Follow 🟠 The Blockchain Group Launches a €300 Million “ATM-type” Capital Increases Program with TOBAM⚡️Full Press Release (EN): theblockchain-group.com/wp-content/upl… Full Press Release (FR): theblockchain-group.com/wp-content/upl… BTC Strategy (EN): theblockchain-group.com/wp-content/upl… 11:53 am · 9 Jun 2025 593 Reply Copy link Read 44 replies With existing holdings worth over $154 million, the company now aims to more than double its reserve, positioning itself as a leading corporate Bitcoin holder in the region. This latest fundraising initiative signals growing institutional interest in Bitcoin outside the United States, and could mark a turning point in Europe’s approach to corporate crypto strategies. Innovative ATM fundraising model draws from US markets Rather than opting for a traditional capital raise, Blockchain Group has taken a page from the United States’ playbook by adopting an “At-The-Market” (ATM) share issuance strategy. Under this model, the company will issue shares directly into the market at current prices but in tranches, not all at once. Each tranche will be sold at either the previous day’s closing price or the volume-weighted average price, whichever is higher, providing more control over price stability. To prevent market disruption, daily issuance will be limited to 21% of that day’s total trading volume. The programme will launch with a modest €500,000 tranche, scaling gradually over time. Partnership with TOBAM enhances institutional credibility Blockchain Group has secured a partnership with TOBAM, a French asset manager known for its quantitative investment strategies, to manage the fundraising and deployment of capital. TOBAM will assist in allocating proceeds towards initiatives that increase profitability while keeping Bitcoin as the strategic core of the company’s operations. The collaboration adds institutional credibility to the initiative and signals a shift toward more structured, regulated, and strategic investments in digital assets within the European financial landscape. It also highlights the rising interest among traditional asset managers in integrating crypto into long-term portfolios. Executive leadership frames it as a long-term Bitcoin strategy Alexandre Laizet, Deputy CEO of Blockchain Group and head of Bitcoin strategy, has been vocal on social media about the firm’s long-term ambitions. He framed the capital raise as a move toward broader global expansion and not merely a treasury boost. According to Laizet, the ATM programme allows for capital flexibility while reinforcing the firm’s commitment to holding and actively managing Bitcoin. Chief Executive Valentin Kosanovic has also emphasised the strategic shift, noting that the group remains “121%” focused on building Bitcoin as a core business driver. This public positioning underscores how Blockchain Group views Bitcoin not just as a hedge or store of value, but as a key pillar in its financial operations and growth strategy.

2025-06-09T10:42:06,"Best Crypto to Buy Now As Japan Follows USA In New Bitcoin Buying Push","Japan has been making steady progress in crypto adoption, and the signs are becoming difficult to ignore. While the United States has captured most of the attention with its institutional moves and political involvement, Japan has quietly aligned itself with similar intent. Investors in the country have become increasingly active in acquiring digital assets, and recent company behavior has brought more attention to this shift. Japan’s Legal and Market Changes Reflect a Structured Approach to Crypto Growth Recent data from Japan shows a rise in both activity and participation. There are now over 12 million crypto exchange accounts registered in the country. Spot trading volumes have touched 1.9 trillion yen , with margin trading close behind. These are not signs of early experimentation. The infrastructure is in place, and usage is rising. At the regulatory level, several developments suggest a push toward creating a more functional crypto economy. A new classification has been introduced for service providers who facilitate transactions but do not hold customer funds. These intermediaries are no longer required to meet capital thresholds, since the responsibility for compliance lies with the licensed platforms they connect users to. The Payment Services Act has been amended to allow up to half of a stablecoin issuer’s backing reserves to be held in low-risk assets. This makes operations more efficient without removing the requirement for reliability. It could also help Japanese stablecoin issuers compete with better-resourced projects in the West. Japan is laser focused on $BTC . pic.twitter.com/V79lz8KzPV — Dylan LeClair (@DylanLeClair_) June 8, 2025 MetaPlanet, a MicroStrategy-like entity based in Japan, serves as a relevant case. The company has been purchasing Bitcoin at regular intervals and has stated its ambition to own one percent of the total supply. This goal alone has sparked significant interest. It has also been trending in Google search results across Japan, suggesting that public awareness is expanding. The pattern is consistent, with interest is growing on both institutional and retail fronts. Taxation is under review as well. Policymakers are discussing a change from the current progressive system to a flat 20% tax on crypto gains . There is also a proposal to allow investors to carry losses forward for up to three years, which would align crypto assets with other investment classes. Alongside these efforts, Japan is considering the legal path to crypto-based ETFs. If passed, this could open the way for more accessible exposure through regulated financial products. These legal changes do not rely on speculation, but rather represent a deliberate policy shift. If other countries in the region respond with similar measures, altcoins with clear utility and early-stage pricing may benefit from this growing attention. Best Crypto to Buy Now That Could Gain Traction in Japan and Rest of Asia SUBBD SUBBD is building a model that breaks away from the usual creator-token gimmickry. Instead of relying on promises about future features or vague mentions of decentralization, it has focused early on utility and access. The $SUBBD token is not just for staking or speculation. It acts as a pass into a platform built for creators, analysts, artists, and niche internet personalities who want more control over how they earn and interact with their audience. The token is already in use. Holders gain access to gated content, analytics tools, and creator-run digital storefronts. What makes this concept stronger is the platform’s design to function across regions, including those where traditional monetization platforms face friction. That makes it easier for creators in Asia and elsewhere to plug into the ecosystem without chasing partnerships with foreign ad networks or donation platforms that rarely work in their favor. SUBBD also operates with its own smart filtering system that helps content surface organically instead of relying on ad-backed recommendation algorithms. This gives users more freedom and creators better visibility. With adoption in Asia gaining pace and regulators opening the door to projects with utility, platforms that create local relevance may find early traction. The token’s presale is still open, giving early buyers a price advantage before further listings are announced. Whether or not Japan becomes a direct target for rollout, SUBBD’s model is well positioned for countries seeking alternatives to platform monopolies. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper is a technical project with a very specific mission. It does not try to reinvent Bitcoin but focuses on extending its usability. Most Bitcoin holders are familiar with the limitations that come with the network’s speed and fees. Bitcoin Hyper works around this by functioning as a secondary network designed to process transactions faster without requiring changes to Bitcoin itself. The architecture draws influence from multiple sources. It uses techniques borrowed from zero-knowledge computation and optimistic validation to process blocks faster. Settlements are still rooted in Bitcoin’s security layer, but the actual transfers happen on Bitcoin Hyper’s layer. This dual setup means faster confirmation times, smaller fees, and broader use cases. Bitcoin Hyper also introduces a system where users can send Bitcoin to a smart contract address, receive an equivalent on the secondary network, and spend it almost instantly. This idea has existed in fragments before, but the execution here is smoother, with fewer dependencies on bridges or manual claims. There is also a meme element that ties into its branding, but that is mostly cosmetic. However, it has helped the project gain major traction across social media channels, with even some top crypto YouTubers having covered it and speculating it to be a high-potential token, with one example being ClayBro . The project has leaned into community-building without letting that distract from its functionality. For markets like Japan, where both meme interest and practical use are respected in equal measure, Bitcoin Hyper might find an audience willing to experiment. The presale is still ongoing, and the early stages suggest healthy traction among crypto participants looking for a project that does something specific and does it well. Snorter Snorter offers a utility-focused trading companion that keeps things simple but effective. Designed to operate entirely through Telegram, it delivers AI-generated trade signals based on a mix of social sentiment, exchange activity, and volume shifts. The model does not promise guaranteed profits or use overhyped language. It observes, analyzes, and delivers signals in plain format, which has made it attractive to early-stage users who are not looking for heavy dashboards or complex setups. What separates Snorter from similar tools is its learning loop. The AI continuously processes trade outcomes and sentiment trends, refining its call accuracy in real time. It supports major tokens and is gradually expanding its list based on user demand and performance data. The utility of the token extends beyond simple access. Holding Snorter’s native token unlocks faster alerts, deeper analytics, and advanced filters that retail traders would typically only get from paid terminals. This makes it more than just a bot; it becomes an affordable, token-driven platform for rapid trade insight. In a country like Japan, where the Financial Services Agency has begun refining the legal framework for crypto services and where traders are increasingly exploring token analytics, Snorter could be well suited for adoption. Telegram usage is widespread, and the local investor base is already showing interest in fast, mobile-first trading companions that do not require heavy technical understanding. If Snorter continues to evolve its AI system and respects data transparency, Japan could become one of its most responsive early markets. Solaxy Solaxy is a Layer 2 project designed to reduce congestion and cost on both Ethereum and Solana, but its approach to the problem is what sets it apart. Instead of launching with lofty promises about being faster or cheaper than everything else, Solaxy focuses on practical compatibility. It allows developers and users to carry out transactions across both chains without needing two wallets, multiple bridges, or token conversions that often confuse users. The system works through a smart transfer mechanism that recognizes the source network and completes the process in the destination format. Gas fees are adjusted automatically, and contracts are pre-verified on both chains. This cuts down on delays and lowers the cost of managing digital assets across platforms. $SOLX has got what YOU need. 🛸🪐45M Raised! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/hamUNI7Hgz — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) June 6, 2025 Having raised more than $45 million at the time of writing, Solaxy also provides a built-in staking module with flexible options. Unlike locked pool models that require long commitments, Solaxy lets users withdraw their funds at preset intervals without incurring penalties. It supports both SOL and ETH-based tokens, which makes it appealing to users who operate in multichain environments. This type of flexibility is likely to gain attention in regions where adoption is tied to convenience and user familiarity. With Japanese regulators showing interest in crypto products that follow structured models and reduce user friction, projects like Solaxy may find support from both developers and investors looking for scalable infrastructure. The token, SOLX, is already gaining interest from several early-stage funds, and the project’s roadmap suggests that it is preparing for regional partnerships once testing phases are complete. BTC Bull BTC Bull is a memecoin with direction. It does not attempt to reshape blockchain infrastructure or build an exchange. It exists to amplify the Bitcoin philosophy through cultural symbols, staking mechanics, and fixed-supply tokenomics. The tone is light, but the structure is deliberate. Its tokenomics are capped and publicly audited. Rewards are distributed based on participation, and staking is built to refresh consistently, avoiding long-term locking or confusing yield curves. While many community tokens rely purely on social traction, BTC Bull merges that approach with simplicity in design. The token runs on a clean model. There are no taxes, no burns, no liquidity traps. It allows early participants to enter with clarity, while maintaining a system that is self-contained and easy to audit. Japan’s rising interest in Bitcoin and its newly introduced regulatory adjustments provide a potential backdrop for a project like BTC Bull to catch attention. Investors in the country have been steadily increasing their crypto exposure, and with public companies like MetaPlanet committing to Bitcoin accumulation, cultural alignment with Bitcoin is growing stronger. Projects that mirror that alignment without the baggage of overengineering may find support from Japanese retail investors who value community but still prefer transparency. BTC Bull remains early in its presale stage. The fundamentals are visible, the audits are done, and the structure is complete. As countries like Japan continue to expand access to crypto in structured ways, projects with clear intent and clean delivery could find the path to adoption far smoother. Conclusion The increase in Japan’s institutional interest and retail participation, along with a steady rise in crypto-related activity across Asia, shows that digital assets are no longer a Western-dominated trend. With regulatory clarity improving and local demand expanding, the market is opening up on multiple fronts. This shift could bring more attention and capital to undervalued altcoins. For those looking to enter at a time when momentum is building, tokens with strong utility or early-stage availability, like the ones mentioned above, may offer a timely opportunity.
