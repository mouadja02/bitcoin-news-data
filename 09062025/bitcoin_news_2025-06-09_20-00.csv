2025-06-09T17:37:50,"Can Ethereum Keep Outshining Bitcoin and XRP in the Race for Big Money?","Ethereum is emerging as the preferred digital asset for institutional investors, outpacing both Bitcoin and XRP in capital inflows. According to CoinShares’ latest fund flows report dated June 2, 2025, Ether recorded $321 million in weekly inflows—more than any other crypto asset. Ether’s Institutional Surge Over the past six weeks, Ethereum has attracted $1.19 billion in institutional funds, including $889 million in the last month. Ether’s total assets under management (AUM) now exceed $14 billion, fueled by strong demand for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and a boost from spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. The $321 million inflow marks Ethereum’s strongest week since December 2024. With the digital asset market experiencing its seventh consecutive week of net inflows—$286 million this week alone—Ether’s dominance signals a trend of institutional diversification away from Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s Inflow Dilemma While the broader crypto market saw positive sentiment, Bitcoin bucked the trend. The asset posted $8 million in outflows, despite major purchases by firms like Michael Saylor’s Strategy. On June 3, Strategy added 705 BTC , bringing its holdings to 580,955 BTC. Japanese firm Metaplanet also acquired more BTC in the same week. Bitcoin prices dropped from a high of $111,000 to $106,000 following a New York court’s decision on former President Trump’s tariff proposal. The ruling triggered investor caution and contributed to Bitcoin’s tepid flow data. Yet, the decline does not suggest a mass exit. Instead, it indicates institutional hesitation amid macroeconomic uncertainties. XRP, once favored for its promise in cross-border payments, saw $28 million in outflows last week. The delay in the U.S. SEC decisions on its anticipated ETF hurt momentum. Despite positive year-to-date figures, monthly flows turned negative. Regulatory ambiguity remains a major hurdle. Source: Coinshares CoinShares also reported shifting geographic investment patterns. While the U.S. remained dominant with $199 million in inflows, other regions showed strength. Germany attracted $42.9 million, Australia $21.5 million, and Hong Kong reported $54.8 million—the highest since launching its crypto exchange-traded products over a year ago. What’s Next for Ethereum? Ethereum’s strong position comes amid broader market growth and rising utility in DeFi. Its advantage lies in active network use cases and growing adoption of ETH-based products. While dominant in market cap, Bitcoin now faces stiffer competition for institutional attention. XRP’s case highlights the influence of regulatory clarity on investment behavior. Until its legal status is resolved, XRP will likely trail its more established peers. Ethereum’s performance indicates a shift in institutional strategy. As DeFi platforms evolve and spot ETFs mature, ETH could remain a leader in the crypto investment race. Still, Bitcoin’s long-term appeal and XRP’s cross-border potential cannot be ruled out.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/can-ethereum-keep-outshining-bitcoin-and-xrp-in-the-race-for-big-money/,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Ethereum News|XRP News",cryptocompare

2025-06-09T17:30:00,"Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) Won’t 10x in 2025, But This Coin Will","While Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) remain dominant forces in the market, many investors are beginning to question whether the two giants can still deliver exponential returns. BTC and ETH have already seen massive growth, making a 10x rally in 2025 increasingly unlikely without a major macro shift. As a result, traders are now hunting for the next big cryptocurrency coins that offer low entry points and explosive upside. One new crypto catching serious attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , priced at $0.03, and positioned as one of the best cryptos to buy now thanks to its ambitious DeFi utility and early-stage potential. Over $10.2 million has been raised and the project now has 11700 holders. For those wondering what crypto to buy now, the next breakout may come from beyond the top 10. In a market where returns matter more than legacy, the shift toward undervalued altcoins may define the top crypto investments of the year. Why Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) Won’t 10x in 2025 Bitcoin (BTC) is traded at $103,799 and Ethereum (ETH) at about $2,415, both representing mature but consistent market positions. With current valuations, both BTC and ETH have huge mountains to climb in order to provide a 10x move within the year since such methamphetamine-type gains would necessitate out-of-the-box market changes or developments. Bitcoin’s price is showing consolidation above $100,000, which is a more established phase, while Ethereum, despite recent network upgrades, is in a rather constricted trading range. For the high-returning investor, newer altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) — under $1 and rooted in DeFi innovation — are becoming the next potential next big cryptocurrency with more explosive potential. Transforming DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Model Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending by merging both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model allows users to lock stablecoins like USDT in liquidity pools backed by smart contracts, receiving passive income while making it easy for borrowers to borrow money easily. Meanwhile, the P2P model eliminates middlemen, allowing lenders and borrowers to directly negotiate with each other. Mutuum Finance stablecoin will launch on the Ethereum blockchain, fully collateralized and USD-pegged. Thanks to the safe, open and Certik-audited nature of this project, blockchain investors enjoy stability. Through the merger of modern finance tech and powerful infrastructure, Mutuum Finance is turning the future of decentralized finance upside down. A DeFi Disruptor Drawing Massive Investor Interest Still in presale, Mutuum Finance has already surpassed more than $10.2 million in funding and has amassed nearly 11,700 investors, making it a solid altcoin ready to experience a major breakthrough. Early Investors Rewarded, Community Continues to Grow With greater growth Mutuum Finance doesn’t forget its early supporters and continues rewarding them. From the investors 10 will be chosen to share a $100,000 giveaway each getting $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens for being part of the project from the beginning. After drawing in funding of over $10.2 million from 11,700 investors, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is growing rapidly and is predicted to be a leading DeFi project priced at only $0.03. Investors entering the round will gain at least a 2x reward as soon as the token is listed on the exchange for $0.06 and the unique lending model and strong Certik auditing provide support for the company’s future success. Since BTC and ETH are no longer growing at the same rate, MUTM is now a choice that investors might find attractive in 2025.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) climbed to $108,000, its highest level since May 29, marking a 7.55% gain from its monthly low. Venice Token ( VVV ) rose to $3.52, sharply up from this month’s low of $2.56. Similarly, Kaia ( KAIA ), Ravencoin ( RVN ), Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ), and SPX6900 ( SPX ) jumped by over 10% on Monday. This surge brought the market capitalization of all coins to over $3.35 trillion. The likely catalyst was the easing of trade tensions between the United States and China, with negotiations beginning in London on Monday afternoon. Talks are expected to extend into Tuesday. Markets are hopeful that the two sides will reach an agreement to ease export controls and possibly reduce tariffs. Such an outcome would likely temper investor fears that have lingered for months amid escalating trade restrictions.

2025-06-09T17:25:15,"As Crypto Press in LATAM Took a Hit, Outset PR Found Where It’s Still Worth Showing Up in 2025","In 2024, Latin America became the world’s second-fastest-growing crypto market. From hyperinflation-driven adoption in Argentina to innovation hubs in Brazil, the appetite for crypto is accelerating in the region. But that momentum isn’t reflected in media visibility. In Q1 2025, LATAM’s crypto-covering newsrooms showed signs of collapse. According to data from Outset PR , a boutique agency specializing in data-driven organic campaigns for Web3, nearly 73% of 55 active publishers lost traffic between January and March — exposing deep instability in the ecosystem meant to amplify crypto’s narrative. Specifically: Traffic across the analyzed sites dropped from 94.48 million visits in January to 81.53 million in February — a steep 13.71% decline. March brought some recovery, up to 85.59M, but most outlets remained below January levels. The Q1 dip coincided with Bitcoin’s 17% price drop and significant losses in altcoins, driven by exchange hacks, meme coin controversies, and tightening U.S. policy signals, alongside a major Google core update in March. Traffic Gainers Exist — But There’s a Catch Only 15 outlets recorded positive traffic growth during Q1. However, many of these aren’t true crypto-native sources. For example, El Diario and Money Times — both drawing millions of visitors month-over-month — are general finance or news portals that tend to boost crypto coverage only during market highs, leaving gaps when volatility kicks in. They’re also less useful for consistent storytelling or long-term Web3 brand building. Crypto-native growth was rare — but telling. A few dedicated outlets posted strong percentage gains: DiarioBitcoin: +204.31% CriptoTendencia: +98.86% Cripto247: +36.17% Yet their total reach still lagged far behind generalist publications . Even after these surges, the listed outlets operated in the 100,000–400,000 monthly visit range, not in the millions. And the cherry on top? Nearly half of Q1’s gainers averaged fewer than 91,000 monthly visitors. Bitcoin Mexico, Blocknews, and Criptomonedas.eu even sat in the sub-10,000 range, making them suitable for SEO or local targeting — but effectively irrelevant for scalable PR or distribution. The Real Crypto Influence Is in the Hands of a Few Sites — Even as They Decline Notably, the top crypto-focused outlets saw traffic declines in February, and many didn’t recover by March. These included: CriptoNoticias Cointelegraph Brasil Livecoins CriptoFacil BitFinanzas Portal do Bitcoin While their grip on attention is no longer stable, their reach remains unmatched . The report reveals a striking concentration: these six sites were the only publishers to surpass 400,000 average monthly visits in Q1 — together accounting for 69% of total crypto-native traffic. The mid-tier segment, represented by seven outlets including DiarioBitcoin, CriptoTendencia, and Cripto247, captured just 23% of crypto audiences. The remaining 8% was spread across 24 low-traffic sites, which consistently failed to exceed 110,000 monthly visits. Outset PR highlights that this long-tail fragmentation limits the utility of many “full coverage” PR packages — where legacy media lists include outlets that are not just declining, but becoming invisible. A prime example is CryptoNews Brasil, which lost its LATAM visibility entirely — likely due to growing regulatory friction, including domain filtering and stricter rules around betting-related advertising. What Crypto PR Needs in LATAM Now Outset PR’s findings highlight a fundamental shift: media performance is no longer predictable , and past reputation doesn’t guarantee present relevance. To build meaningful traction, crypto brands need to evolve their approach. Here’s what Outset PR recommends. Right moves Wrong moves Diversify across crypto-native outlets with proven stability and/or growth Rely on static media kits or outdated lists — focus on your goals and plan accordingly Mix niche crypto and finance portals for layered visibility during bullish cycles Assume high traffic means high crypto engagement — vet editorial consistency Track Google algorithm updates and local regulatory changes regularly Expect one or two publishers to carry your campaign — scale horizontally across tiers How Outset PR Does It Differently Outset PR doesn’t pitch blind. It audits the media landscape quarter by quarter, using a proprietary system to map reach, relevance, and algorithmic shifts across the markets. Campaigns are built with live performance data Each media outlet is hand-selected based on audience quality, not just quantity Market timing and platform resilience are factored into publishing decisions This data-driven, boutique model ensures that PR is a strategic asset aligned with your roadmap and resources.

2025-06-09T17:15:26,"Bitcoin climbs past $107K as U.S.–China trade talks resume, KAIA, SPX lead gains","Bitcoin extended its rebound through the weekend and into Monday, supported by resurgent macro tailwinds that lifted broader risk sentiment. Market sentiment improved sharply, with the Fear and Greed Index rising from 46 on June 6 to 55 by June 10, its highest in early June. Over the same period, total crypto market capitalisation jumped 5.8%, climbing from $3.28 trillion to $3.47 trillion as capital flowed back into digital assets. Altcoin markets had also flipped positive at the time of writing, with gains seen across nearly all of the top 99 cryptocurrencies. Why is Bitcoin going up? Bitcoin’s latest rally comes amid renewed optimism over the outcome of high-stakes trade talks between the United States and China. As officials from both sides meet in London today, markets are hoping for signs of easing tensions in the long-running tariff standoff. The talks, led by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, are expected to focus on key tariff barriers that have weighed on global trade. Traders are closely watching for any post-meeting statements from President Donald Trump, who last week signalled confidence, saying, “The meeting should go very well.” A meaningful breakthrough could help stabilise risk sentiment, with Bitcoin increasingly viewed as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty. For many, the success of Circle’s listing is a broader vote of confidence in the digital asset industry. Beyond geopolitics, institutional tailwinds are also fuelling the recovery. Circle, the issuer of USDC, officially began trading on the New York Stock Exchange last week and saw overwhelming demand that forced underwriters to upsize the offering by one-third.. The long-awaited public debut is being seen as a vote of confidence in digital asset infrastructure, boosting investor sentiment around crypto’s integration with traditional finance. In another key development, The Blockchain Group, a Paris-based firm positioning itself as Europe’s first Bitcoin treasury company, announced plans to raise over $340 million to expand its BTC holdings, just one week after purchasing $68 million worth of Bitcoin. Together, these catalysts have helped Bitcoin regain momentum after last week’s decline. If macro conditions continue to stabilise, analysts say BTC could soon test resistance levels last seen before the recent slump. What’s next for Bitcoin? Bitcoin managed to push past $106,000 over the weekend and reached as high as $107,000 on Monday, before encountering seller pressure near key resistance. The weekly close brought BTC/USD back near its opening level, effectively marking a full-circle recovery that traders say could carry technical significance. Analyst Rekt Capital noted that Bitcoin had broken its two-week downtrend and identified $106,600 as a key resistance level that needed to be flipped into support.

Bitcoin’s recent performance also marked its fourth consecutive weekly close in the green. Rekt Capital pointed to $104,400 as an important level that held, though a definitive bull market structure still appeared to be developing. Others see signs that Bitcoin may be building strength after its recent dip to $100,000. Trader CryptoKing described Bitcoin’s current structure as the “calm before the storm,” noting that Bitcoin was compressing just below $107,800 in what they called a classic volatility squeeze, with higher lows, fading volume, and a cooling RSI suggesting a breakout could be imminent. BTC/USD 1-day chart. Source: CryptoKing/X Market participants are also keeping a close eye on liquidity patterns. Over the past month, Bitcoin’s price has frequently moved sharply in both directions to tap into thick liquidity zones. Daan Crypto Trades said the $100,000 mark now represents the key level to watch on the downside, warning that a break below it could “really accelerate” the correction. Daan Crypto Trades @DaanCrypto · Follow The $BTC Liquidation chart is telling the same story as the charts where the big liquidity clusters are lining up nicely with important key levels.Below $100K and Thursday’s low is where things can really accelerate and see continuation of this current correction.But above 9:32 PM · Jun 8, 2025 309 Reply Copy link Read 63 replies However, they also flagged upside liquidity near all-time highs at $112,000 as a likely target if bulls maintain momentum. Beyond technicals, macro factors are expected to impact Bitcoin’s trajectory. This week’s release of U.S. inflation data, including the May CPI and PPI prints on June 11–12, will serve as a crucial gauge of market sentiment. Although inflation has been gradually slowing in 2025, Fed officials have remained hesitant to commit to rate cuts. That reluctance has drawn criticism from President Trump and left risk asset traders anxiously watching the central bank’s next move. According to CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, markets are not expecting a cut at the upcoming June or July FOMC meetings. However, the possibility of a 25-basis-point cut in September remains open. Analysts say any signs of softer inflation could revive expectations of looser monetary policy, potentially serving as a tailwind for Bitcoin and other risk assets. According to Swissblock, a private wealth management firm, inflation data due this week could “unleash volatility” across risk markets. In a June 9 post on X, the firm noted that while Bitcoin bulls are “slowly rebuilding structure and regrouping,” a short-term pullback to the $104,000 range remains likely. That cautious outlook was echoed by Mickybull Crypto, who pointed to a head-and-shoulders formation emerging on the daily chart. The analyst projected a possible retracement to $101,500 before any renewed push to fresh highs. Some analysts argue that any short-term downside is unlikely to affect the long-term uptrend. Fellow analyst SuperBro noted that Bitcoin has now held above its highest weekly close from 2021 for four consecutive weeks and hasn’t fallen below the five-week EMA since early May. According to the analyst, these structural signals suggest that “bulls are fully in control,” and once Bitcoin decisively breaks the long-term trendline stretching back to 2021, the next leg higher could take it to the $140,000–$150,000 range.

Ethereum (ETH), the largest altcoin by market cap, rose 0.85% over the past day to trade at $2,541 at the time of writing. Other major altcoins like Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and Hyperliquid (HYPE) saw gains ranging from 0.5% to 7%, while XRP (XRP) and Tron (TRX) recorded slight losses of 1.1% and 0.76%, respectively.

2025-06-09T17:15:12,"Wall Street Cheers Circle IPO, But Bitcoin Sentiment Still Flat","Wall Street is piling into crypto equities, but markets haven’t responded with similar excitement. In fact, Bitcoin funding rates remain low, which is indicative of a continued caution as the world’s leading crypto asset trades around the $107K mark. Bitcoin Traders Remain Cautious There’s a growing disconnect between public market enthusiasm for crypto equities and the underlying digital asset market. Circle’s IPO, which pushed its valuation to $24 billion – nearly $20 billion higher than Coinbase’s prior offer – has renewed Wall Street’s appetite for crypto-related stocks. However, Bitcoin’s muted funding rate, which has even turned negative, suggests that crypto traders remain cautious. According to Matrixport’s latest report , some investors may be betting on crypto stocks while shorting Bitcoin to hedge exposure. Despite the renewed institutional interest in equity markets, this optimism has yet to translate into a significant uptick in demand or price momentum within the broader crypto asset space. Signs Of Fatigue QCP Capital also pointed to the growing signs of stagnation in the Bitcoin market as implied volatility continues to decline ahead of summer. Implied vols are now at one-year lows and appear relatively cheap, yet realized volatility is even lower, which indicates a lack of price movement. Past data indicates that front-end volatility typically continues to decline as the market moves deeper into July. A similar pattern occurred last year, when 1-month at-the-money vols fell sharply from 80% in March to 40% by July, as Bitcoin repeatedly failed to break past the $70,000 resistance level. This year, QCP noted that no immediate macro catalyst is present to push Bitcoin meaningfully above $110,000 or below $100,000 levels, which it believes would be necessary to reignite market interest. While US equities rallied and gold dipped following a stronger-than-expected jobs report, Bitcoin remained largely unresponsive. As such, “signs of fatigue” are evident, with perpetual open interest weakening and spot Bitcoin ETF inflows beginning to slow. Options market activity mirrors this indecision, as traders roll their bullish positions from July to September in significant size, indicating a delay in expectations for any major upside move.

Dogecoin Price Prediction: ‘DOGE Millionaire’ Doubles Down on Memes – Which Coin is He Buying Now? Contessoto actually invested in PEPE back in February, ditching his Ethereum holdings and putting $1 million into the frog-themed meme token. $PEPE is at a $6 Billion dollar mcap 3 months after I posted this… Is it too early to revisit this tweet? My $PEPE is currently worth $1.5 Million https://t.co/y02LBflUw3 — SlumDOGE Millionaire (@ProTheDoge) May 12, 2025 The Doge Millionaire has also opened positions in BRETT and WIF in recent weeks, with the trader posting a couple of weeks ago that he switched from TOSHI to BRETT . But as mentioned above, he continues to hold just over 5 million DOGE , or about $925,000 at today’s prices. This stands as a big vote of confidence in the long-running meme token, which despite underwhelming in the first half of 2025 may have the potential to have a stronger second half of the year. And if we look at its chart today, we see that it’s potentially in a very bullish position, with its indicators bottoming out recently. Source: TradingView Its RSI (purple), for example, touched 30 a few days ago and now appears to have begun a climb upwards. At the same time, DOGE’s 30-day average (orange) is about to bottom out in relation to the 200-day (blue), another signal that we could be in for an upwards correction. But we may have to wait for the Dogecoin price to fall a little further before it has a sustained recovery, given that some whales have been sending the coin to exchanges in the past week . After that, it should return to $0.20 by the end of June, and $0.50+ by August. New Meme Tokens with Strong Fundamentals If DOGE still seems a little too uncertain for some traders, they may prefer to investigate newer meme tokens, with several new examples boasting interesting fundamentals. New ERC-20 token Bitcoin Bull (BULL) is capturing serious attention as it combines meme coin energy with real Bitcoin utility — including BTC airdrops for holders. With nearly $7 million raised and just 20 days left in its presale, investors are rushing to secure their bags before the next price increase. Hold tight, bulls. When Bitcoin hits $150K, BTCBULL airdrop goes live. Step by step. Candle by candle. pic.twitter.com/d9ctOBDSDn — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) June 4, 2025 What sets BTCBULL apart is its unique tokenomics: Bitcoin airdrops are distributed to $BTCBULL holders each time BTC hits a $50K milestone, starting at $150,000 . A token burn is triggered for every $25K BTC rise — beginning with a major burn at $125,000 — slashing supply and boosting scarcity. This dual reward structure not only incentivizes holding but also positions BTCBULL as one of the most explosive presale opportunities of the year. Built on Ethereum with a total supply of 21 billion tokens, BTCBULL is also fully stakeable , offering dynamic APYs during and after the presale. To join the sale before it’s too late, you need simply go to the Bitcoin Bull website and connect a wallet, such as Best Wallet . BTCBULL is available at $0.002555, a price which could end up seeming very cheap when the token goes live.

2025-06-09T17:11:06,"Huge Move Concerning XRP and Three Major Altcoins from Nasdaq!","While interest in Bitcoin and altcoins has increased significantly recently, a major move regarding XRP and three major altcoins came from the major US stock exchange Nasdaq. Accordingly, technology exchange Nasdaq added four more altcoins to its cryptocurrency index, increasing the total number of assets from 5 to 9. Accordingly, Nasdaq filed Form 8-K with the SEC to add four altcoins, namely XRP, Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Stellar (XLM), to its crypto index. If Nasdaq’s application to the SEC for NCIUSS, which is a reference index, is accepted, XRP, SOL, XLM and ADA will be added to the fund, excluding Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Chainlink (LINK), Litecoin (LTC) and Uniswap (UNI). Hashdex’s ETF, which trades under the ticker NCIQ, also tracks this index and only offers investment in BTC and ETH due to regulations in the US, as restrictions imposed by the SEC prevent the ETF from holding digital assets other than BTC and ETH. However, if the SEC approves the application, Hasdex's NCIQ ETF will also be able to invest in all nine cryptocurrencies in the index. The SEC's final decision deadline is November 2, 2025, and a decision must be made by that date. *This is not investment advice.

Eight major crypto policy organizations and firms have voiced strong support for the inclusion of the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act in the updated version of the CLARITY Act , a U.S. legislative proposal focused on digital asset market structure. The move signals growing consensus in the blockchain industry around creating clear regulatory distinctions between custodial financial institutions and non-custodial software developers. In a joint statement issued June 5 , entities including Coin Center, the DeFi Education Fund, Solana Policy Institute, Uniswap Labs, Jump, Paradigm, and others endorsed the BRCA’s provisions. You might also like: Can XRP price realistically hit $27 as one pundit predicts? Non-custodial exemptions The companies argue that developers of peer-to-peer, non-custodial blockchain technologies should not be classified as money transmitters under current financial regulations, as they do not handle or control customer funds. The BRCA, originally introduced by Representatives Tom Emmer and Ritchie Torres, draws upon a 2019 advisory from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which clarified that developers who merely write code or provide infrastructure without accessing user funds should not be subject to money transmission laws. By incorporating this logic into statutory law, the updated CLARITY Act seeks to remove longstanding legal ambiguity that many developers say hinders innovation. Supporters of the BRCA maintain that this legal clarity is necessary to foster innovation in decentralized finance and other blockchain-based systems, while still allowing regulators to supervise custodial entities that manage users’ assets. The updated bill is seen as striking a careful balance, encouraging domestic blockchain development without weakening consumer safeguards. The joint statement also thanked Chairmen French Hill and Bryan Steil, Majority Whip Tom Emmer, and Representative Ritchie Torres for their roles in crafting and advancing the legislation.

The latest numbers from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights show that 36,659 Americans are affected by a hacking/IT incident at Cumberland County Hospital (CCH). CCH says that an unknown attacker breached its systems and stole patient and employee data, which may include names, dates of birth, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, ethnicities, Social Security numbers, medications, diagnoses, treatment notes, dates of service, medical record numbers, health plan numbers, claims and billing records. The hospital also says that the thief may have siphoned the employment data of current and former employees, including driver’s licenses, birth certificates, background check records, W-4 and W-2 tax forms and bank account numbers. “On April 3, 2025, CCH discovered unauthorized access by a third party to our computer system. We immediately shut down all computers, disabled data sharing connections, contacted law enforcement, and began investigating… Cybersecurity experts determined that the unauthorized access to our computer system began on February 21, 2025, and ended on April 3, 2025. The electronic medical records system that CCH and its partners use to record and bill for patient care was not involved or accessed in this incident. “ CCH is a Kentucky-based hospital offering outpatient and inpatient healthcare services. The hospital says it immediately sent letters of notification to affected individuals to shed more light on the data breach, while offering free identity monitoring services for 12 months. For now, CCH says that its IT team has revamped the hospital’s security protocols to prevent a similar incident from happening again.

2025-06-09T16:38:41,"Tether solves compatibility challenges with third-party OS","Today, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino revealed that the company plans to open-source its Bitcoin mining OS (MOS). He aims to create an even playing field and close the gap between publicly traded and smaller companies. MOS is a highly scalable, resilient, and modular OS built with a peer-to-peer IoT architecture at its core. Ardoino said new Bitcoin mining companies will be able to enter the market and enjoy a competitive environment to keep the network safe. Third-party hosted software will no longer be required since the OS can scale from a Raspberry PI connected to several miners to full site deployments with multiple redundant mainframes monitoring a vast number of miners. Tether targets Q4 2025 for MOS launch The development team at Teather is currently working on documentation, user guides, and repository preparation for community access, with the release targeted for Q4 2025. According to Ardoino, MOS has built-in plugins for monitoring and interacting with many popular mining machines and vendors. The operating system can also interact with and monitor a variety of containers, such as air-cooled and immersion, multiple types of electrical equipment, and thermostats. He revealed that developers can create custom plugins for other specific equipment and contribute to the main codebase. Tether will work towards open-sourcing its Bitcoin Mining OS (MOS).

MOS will create an even playing field reducing the… — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) June 9, 2025 The CEO plans to use QuantumVerse Automatic Computer (QVAC) integration to build better reports and enhance production based on custom AI tools that learn from massive datasets generated by Mining OS. He said MOS will make life easier for small and mid-sized businesses that produce their electricity and will soon start mining with the OS. Tether announced QVAC last month, a development platform for Infinite Intelligence designed for humans and machines alike. QVAC enables highly scalable AI applications and agents to run directly on local devices without dependence on centralized services and cloud infrastructure. Ardoino said that AI should empower society and humanity’s next wave of growth, not delegating more control to corporations that already own servers and access keys. The announcement came just two days after the company said it had no intention of going public. Ardoino argued that Artemis CEO Jon Ma’s valuation speculation would be too low, considering the company’s current Bitcoin and gold treasury. Ma claimed that if Tether were to go public, it would rank as the 19th largest company globally with a valuation of $515 billion, which is larger than multinational giants like Costco and Coca-Cola. Tether solves compatibility challenges with third-party OS Paolo Ardoino , Tether’s CEO, stated that compatibility and efficiency are notable challenges with third-party OS platforms. Some OSes, such as Hive OS, do not support older GPU models, such as Nvidia RTX series or modern AMD graphics cards, which limits their use for GPU-based mining setups. Another instance is the ASIC-specific OSes like Braiins OS, which are limited to ASIC models, excluding miners from using non-supported hardware. He believes Tether can help solve the problem by allowing developers to create specific plugins and modular support for various hardware. Ardoino said Tether has invested $5 billion in Bitcoin mining and energy-related businesses. “In the last 2 years Tether Group reinvested almost 5 billion USD of its profits within the United States economy and into US-based companies. Some examples: Rumble, Blackrock Neurotech, XXI and different Bitcoin mining ventures.” – Paolo Ardoino , Tether CEO Tether revealed last month that it will soon launch the first QVAC-based AI apps, focusing mainly on privacy preservation and self-sovereignty. The company will launch QVAC Translate, which delivers text, speech, and image translation without reliance on the cloud. QVAC Health, also set for launch, is a private wellness tracker that will keep sensitive health data locally on the device. Tether aims to use QVAC to build the first open and universal AI agent ecosystem at the service of humans and machines. Tether’s CEO sees making MOS open-source as a way to strengthen network decentralization and security, as more participants can join the network and keep it safe.

2025-06-09T16:33:44,"XRP Price Prediction: Breakout Chart Identical to 2017 Rally Sparks Bullish Frenzy","The XRP price has reclaimed $2.23 today, with its 1% increase coming as the cryptocurrency market as a whole falls by 2% in the past 24 hours. XRP is now up by 3% in a week , and while it remains down by 6% in the last 30 days it boasts an impressive 350% increase in a year. And what’s bullish today is that its chart is producing a pattern we last saw in 2017, prior to enjoying a huge breakout to its still-current ATH of $3.40. This could mean that something similar is about to happen again, and given Ripple’s strong fundamentals, the long-term XRP price prediction looks very promising. XRP Price Prediction: Breakout Chart Identical to 2017 Rally Sparks Bullish Frenzy If we zoom out and look at XRP’s one-week chart, it becomes clear that it may be on the same path as it followed in 2017, albeit on a bigger scale. Back in 2017, XRP experienced an initial rally to about $0.4 in May, before correcting a little over the summer and then launching a surge towards $3.40 in December and January. We could therefore argue that something similar is happening this year: after reaching a seven-year high of $3.31 in January, the XRP price has corrected to $2.23 but now appears to be regathering the momentum whereby it could rise even higher. Source: TradingView Of course, history does not always repeat itself, so trader’s shouldn’t take the reproduction of past patterns as a given. But if we zoom in and look at the coin’s one-day chart, we see that its support (green) and resistance (red) levels have formed a bullish pennant. Source: TradingView We could see the XRP price break out from the increasingly narrow band it has been occupying in recent weeks, potentially rising towards $3 by the end of the summer. Analysts also suspect that XRP is close to doing something big, with Dark Defender predicting that the coin will hit a new all-time high this year. This will depend on the coin breaking through its current resistance level at around $2.50, while it will also depend on the fate of numerous XRP ETF applications . Don't think much about #XRP . The ones who thought much can now buy 10% of what they could have purchased when XRP was at 20 Cents. The same will happen in the upcoming days. People will be able to secure less and less XRP. Remember remember! ""Our Road for All Time High Is… pic.twitter.com/RWuhPX2SpV — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) June 8, 2025 But with Ripple expanding its cross-border payment business recently, the XRP price is certainly in a good position to continue rising throughout the rest of the year. New Altcoins Bring Big-Rally Potential While XRP remains one of the most bullish major tokens in the market, it won’t be the only altcoin gaining strongly in the second half of the year. There will also be a variety of newer tokens that will do well, with certain presale coins in a good position now to outpace the market once they launch. One of these is Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL), an ERC-20 token that has now raised $6.9 million in its soon-to-be-ending sale. Last chance to buy BTCBULL before launch! The countdown ends on June 30th. Here’s what’s coming: BTCBULL token burns BTC airdrops at price milestones BTCBULL airdrop when Bitcoin hits $250K Join the herd: https://t.co/FQZXEzFwWu pic.twitter.com/aeUmLJcSOC — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) June 2, 2025 With 20 days left to run, BTCBULL’s presale has been gaining momentum, with investors very enthusiastic about the coin’s deflationary tokenomics. In particular, it will have a hard cap of 21 billion BTCBULL, with the coin’s team planning to conduct token burns whenever Bitcoin (BTC) reaches new price milestones. The first burn will take place when BTC hits $125,000, with subsequent burns taking place with each additional $25,000 gained. On top of this, Bitcoin Bull will also host airdrops – of BTC itself – whenever Bitcoin hits a new $50,000 milestone, beginning with $150,000. This could make BTCBULL incredibly profitable to hold, with owners also able to stake the token for a passive income. While its sale is ending soon, investors can still join by going to the Bitcoin Bull website and connecting a wallet. BTCBULL is selling at its final presale price of $0.002555, although the success of its sale suggests that it could have a very strong listing.

On June 6, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) confirmed that it will allow individual investors to buy these sanctioned crypto products, previously only open to professionals on sanctioned investment exchanges like the London Stock Exchange. The policy shift, overturning a ban that's been on the books since 2019, forms part of a broader post-Brexit strategy to boost competitiveness and attract fintech innovation. Crypto ETNs and ETFs tracking the value of assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum will be available to retail buyers if they're traded on FCA-listed venues and in accordance with strict financial promotion and risk disclosure rules. Despite this, the retail crypto derivatives ban continues to stand, mirroring concerns regarding volatility and consumer protection in the marketplace. David Geale, the FCA's executive director of payments and digital assets, was keen to note the regulator's new stance: ”We want to rebalance our approach to risk, and lifting the ban would allow people to make their own decision on whether such a high-risk investment was right for them, in the context of the fact that they might lose all their money.” The industry leaders welcomed the move as a signal that Britain is ”open for crypto,” with Bivu Das of Kraken UK labelling it a ”major milestone” and a sign that old restrictions no longer serve their function. The new products that have been authorized are crypto ETNs and ETFs on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major tokens, under FCA standards and being traded on authorized exchanges. This means British investors can now include digital assets in traditional investment portfolios, without the need to go to offshore or unregulated platforms. It is predicted by analysts that this will trigger significant inflows into UK-listed crypto funds, aligning with US, EU, and Hong Kong. Industry reaction has been swift and generally positive. Ian Taylor of CryptoUK termed the action as ”welcome a move by the FCA, acknowledging that the market has matured significantly.” Laurent Kssis of CEC Capital further added the update will help to replace the previous over-reliance on offshore exchanges, while Duncan Moir of 21Shares believes it will ”enhance legitimacy and increase allocations from traditional financial institutions.”. However, the UK's new regime does have robust safeguards. The FCA will require clear risk warnings, ban inappropriate marketing incentives, and monitor the market for signs of consumer harm. The government's wider crypto regulation overhaul, introducing as early as 2026, will place exchanges, custodians, and brokers in line with traditional finance — ushering in a new era of due diligence and institutional gravitas. Adoption of crypto in the UK is already in progress, with ownership levels doubling to 12% in 2024 from 4% in 2021. As London rivals as a potential hub for Europe's crypto market, removal of the ETN prohibition is considered an action of utmost significance to bring in retail investors and overseas fintech entrants. The FCA's evolving stance is also set to trigger further innovation in stablecoins, DeFi, and tokenized securities, making the UK competitive again as the EU's MiCA regime comes into force.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9500/uk-lifts-crypto-ban-will-london-become-europe-s-bitcoin-hub,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Legal",cryptocompare
2025-06-09T16:24:10,"Strategy Boosts Corporate Stash With $110 Million Bitcoin Top-Up As Total Holdings Reach 582,000 BTC","Michael Saylor-led Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, expanded its Bitcoin coffers with its most recent purchase. According to a Monday US Securities and Exchange (SEC) filing, Strategy scooped up 1,045 Bitcoin between June 2 and June 8 at an average price of $105,426 per coin. The Tysons, a Virginia-based firm, is the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, controlling 582,000 Bitcoin worth roughly $62.7 billion based on current prices. Strategy started accumulating Bitcoin in August 2020 with an initial purchase of 21,454 BTC for $250 million. It now owns the equivalent of 2.8% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply. Bitcoin was changing hands at $107,687 at press time, up about 1.9% over the past 24 hours, according to crypto market data provider CoinGecko. Last month, the apex crypto climbed to an all-time high of $111,000 before giving up those gains. Strategy’s total cache was purchased at an average price of $70,086 per Bitcoin for a total cost of around $40.8 billion, including fees and expenses. Strategy’s most recent Bitcoin acquisition was financed with proceeds from at-the-market sales of its perpetual Strike preferred stock, STRK, and perpetual Strife preferred stock, STRF. The company raised $66.4 million and $45.8 million by selling STRF and STRK, respectively. “Strategy is fully torqued Bitcoin,” Strategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor posited Friday on X, highlighting the Bitcoin Treasury company’s comparatively impressive performance compared to Tesla, Bitcoin, Meta, and gold, among other companies and assets over the past year. The company’s market capitalization stands at $102.3 billion, up from the $1.2 billion reported in July 2020 before kicking off its Bitcoin accumulation spree. Its success story has inspired a long list of other publicly traded companies to follow suit. With Trump Media and Gamestop recently joining the likes of Metaplanet (nicknamed “Japan’s MicroStrategy”) and Semler Scientific in adopting Saylor’s Bitcoin playbook and building their own BTC treasuries.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/strategy-boosts-corporate-stash-with-110-million-bitcoin-top-up-as-total-holdings-reach-582000-btc/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|STRK","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|MicroStrategy",cryptocompare

The recovery gained momentum through consecutive higher lows, potentially pointing to accumulation at lower levels. However, bitcoin's BTC performance will likely dictate the next major move for altcoins such as LINK. LINK rose 1.4% over the past 24 hours in line with the price action of the broader digital asset market. The crypto market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index was up 1.1%. Technical Indicators Point to Continued Strength: LINK experienced a sharp 14.4% correction from $13.972 to $13.557, followed by a strong recovery with high-volume support at $13.582. Notable resistance emerged at $13.960-13.970, where selling pressure intensified twice during the trading session. At 10:00 UTC, price action marked a decisive breakout with the highest volume of the period (1,061,645 LINK). A new trading range established between $13.800-13.950, indicating potential continuation of the uptrend if volume remains supportive. V-shaped recovery pattern formed with strong buying at the $13.785-13.790 support zone. The $13.830-13.840 range now establishes itself as a potential new support zone for continued upward movement.

Fewer Than You Might Think","As of June 2025, fewer than 3% of U.S. Congress members have reported owning any form of cryptocurrency. Only 13 lawmakers have disclosed crypto exposure, and just nine of them own Bitcoin directly. Senator Cynthia Lummis, Senator Ted Cruz, and Vice President J.D.

Despite a growing number of pro-Bitcoin voices in the U.S. Congress, only a handful of lawmakers currently report owning any form of cryptocurrency.

2025-06-09T16:14:36,"Strategy Buys Bitcoin Worth $110M, Pushes Holdings to 582,000 BTC","Strategy has added 1,045 more BTC to its already massive treasury. This news comes from a recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. With this latest purchase, the Nasdaq-listed firm continues to lead the charge among public companies embracing Bitcoin as a long-term asset. Strategy Nearly Holds 3% of Bitcoin Fixed Supply As shared in an X post, Strategy bought 1,045 BTC for $110.2 million between June 2 and 8 at an average price of $105,426. This brings its total holdings to 582,000 BTC, worth over $62 billion. The company has spent $40.8 billion overall, with an average cost of $70,086 per coin. The company now has about $21 billion in unrealized gains and owns almost 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply . Strategy keeps buying Bitcoin regularly. Just before the latest purchase, it bought 705 BTC for $75.1 million between May 26 and June 1, at an average price of $106,495. Chairman Michael Saylor has also hinted at further Bitcoin buys . Strategy Funds Bitcoin Latest Buy With Preferred Stock Strategy paid for its recent Bitcoin buys by selling two types of preferred stock: STRK and STRF. Last week, it sold 626,639 STRK shares for $66.4 million and 432,679 STRF shares for $45.8 million. The company still has $20.6 billion worth of STRK and $2 billion of STRF left to sell. It did not sell any of its regular MSTR shares last week, though $18.6 billion is still available under that plan. Strategy’s preferred stock programs are part of a larger blueprint it calls the “42/42” plan. This plan aims to raise $84 billion by 2027 to buy more Bitcoin. This plan initially started as “21/21,” with a $42 billion goal, but was doubled later. Last week, Strategy also launched a new stock, STRD , which pays a 10% yearly dividend. STRD is non-convertible and non-cumulative. In contrast, STRK is a convertible stock with an 8% fixed annual dividend, while STRF is non-convertible and offers a 10% cumulative dividend. A Trend Other Companies Are Following Strategy is not alone in building a bitcoin treasury. A total of 144 companies have adopted this model, with 114 of them publicly traded. Newer entrants include Tether-backed Twenty One, Trump Media, GameStop, and Basel Medical group , joining earlier adopters like Metaplanet and Semler Scientific. Analysts at Bernstein believe these companies, led by Strategy, could collectively add $330 billion in Bitcoin over the next five years. They see a more crypto-friendly U.S. government as a potential driver of this trend. Despite some investor concerns, the Strategy is doing well. Its market cap is $102.4 billion, and it has low debt with no big payments due until 2028. MSTR stock rose 1.5% on Friday to $374.47 and was up 2.3% Monday morning.

His statement relates to the proposed expansion plans on the network, which Mow believes could erode BTC’s status as a currency. Samson Mow Speaks Against Bitcoin Core Developers In an X post , Samson Mow declared that the Bitcoin core developers have become a risk to Bitcoin. Mow was responding to a comment by developer Jamesob, in which he explained why the core developers have more authority over the BTC ecosystem than some might think. This indicates that they could easily move ahead with the expansion plans, which Mow is wary of. Jamesob stated that the Bitcoin Core developers have a tremendous amount of latent power for at least two reasons. Firstly, he noted that every business has basically hardcoded the use of that implementation with levels of risk aversion surpassing “never got fired for buying IBM.” The developer claimed that this has created an amazing de facto monopoly on economic nodes. Simply put, these Core developers have so much autonomy over how the network runs. Secondly, Jamesob stated that the Bitcoin network is so complicated that any non-developer inherently must delegate to some technical authority they trust. He added that the Core developers have ended up being the target of that delegation. The developer remarked that this is a “tremendous amount of sticky power,” and that anyone who fails to realize it is naive. These comments come amid the spam wars debate. Bitcoinist reported that the Bitcoin Core developers have taken a stance, with plans to proceed with the OP_RETURN expansion. The developers declared that they won’t step in to stop “harmless” data from entering the network, as this negates Bitcoin’s purpose as a tool against censorship. However, maximalists like Samson Mow argue that this could undermine BTC’s status as Sound Money. Mow Alludes To Past Comments Against The Proposal Samson Mow also alluded to past comments against Bitcoin developer Greg Maxwell and the proposed OP-RETURN expansion on the network. Mow stated that Greg was being disingenuous in his support of the proposal and that it is too bad that most people worshipped him too much to see the truth. Greg remarked that the actually proposed change is insubstantial and that it allows traffic that appears today as fake outputs, which bloat the UTXO set, to become non-bloating traffic. However, Samon Mow holds a different opinion and declared that Greg is either “intellectually dishonest or doesn’t understand the current reality.” Meanwhile, Samson Mow also responded to the recent statement that the Bitcoin Core Developers put out. He alleged that the developers have been changing the network gradually to enable spam, and now seem focused on also removing barriers for spammers. At the time of writing, the BTC price is trading at around $105,400, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-core-product-risk/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Coinmarketcap|Greg Maxwell|Jamesob|OP-RETURN Expansion|Samson Mow|UTXO",cryptocompare

He’s put about 80% of his net worth into BTC at an average price below $25,000. Rather than fret over today’s high sticker, he says the odds favor more gains ahead than losses. Related Reading: Blank Pi Network Wallets Spark Outcry—What’s The Network Hiding? Deaton’s Big Bet According to Deaton, buying at six figures isn’t too late. He calls today’s price range “more asymmetrical,” meaning the upside is greater than the downside. He’s put 80% of his wealth into Bitcoin. His average entry cost was less than $25,000. Still, he sees room to run even from around $106,000. Macro Concerns Drive Interest Based on reports, Deaton worries about soaring national debt in the US and fresh tariffs from US President Donald Trump’s time in office. He flags endless money printing by central banks as a red flag. I’m not in favor of telling people living paycheck to paycheck (me until 15 years ago) to take out a mortgage on their primary home to buy Bitcoin (I’m not suggesting that that’s what David is recommending either), but I am in the process of selling real estate, and although my… https://t.co/JMB1zgeazW — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) June 8, 2025 He says all these moves are chipping away at trust in fiat cash. With only 21 million BTC ever to be mined, Bitcoin can’t be inflated away. That fixed supply, he argues, makes it a solid hedge against a shaky dollar. Corporate And State Adoption Institutional demand is also on the rise. MicroStrategy—now called Strategy—holds more than 200,000 BTC, worth tens of billions of dollars. And in the last seven days, 16 companies have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. On the government side, Rep. Tim Burchett introduced a bill to turn a Trump executive order into law, creating a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Countries like Pakistan, Ukraine, and Ireland are weighing similar steps. They want to see if holding Bitcoin could protect their foreign exchange plans. Skeptics Voice Worries Not everyone agrees with Deaton’s rosy outlook. Economist Peter Schiff, a gold advocate, says Bitcoin has no real value and is too wild to be a safe haven. He tweeted that today’s rally is just hype. Deaton doesn’t shy away from such criticism. He admits he has “confirmation and wealth-preservation bias.” He still insists Bitcoin is the best store of value during today’s economic storms. Related Reading: Elon Musk ‘Will Do Anything’ To Make XRP King, Tech Mogul Says Deaton warns against buying with money you can’t afford to lose. He tells people living paycheck-to-paycheck not to risk their homes or take out loans just to buy crypto. His basic message is simple: look past daily price swings and ask where the world’s money is headed. If you share his concerns about the dollar and believe institutions will keep piling in, his bet on Bitcoin could pay off. But anyone on the sidelines should be ready for big swings and should only invest what they can handle.

The move will see President Trump’s backed entities make deeper inroads into the crypto asset markets. Institutional investors increase their appetite for crypto products, leading to a new cycle as prices flash new highs. Trump Media Readies Huge Purchase According to sources familiar with the matter, Trump Media Group, the firm behind Truth Social, plans a $3 billion raise to buy multiple crypto assets. The Financial Times reported that the company seeks to raise $2 billion in equity and $1 billion in a convertible bond sale . If the deal goes through, Trump-related companies will extend their foray into digital assets to the delight of most crypto users. President Trump’s backing has fueled institutional and retail sentiments since the start of his second term in the White House. In January, Trump Media announced plans to roll out a fintech arm as part of a crypto-linked diversification process. At the time, the firm sought to purchase $250 million of digital assets and subsequently struck a deal with Crypto.com. Since his inauguration, the President has spurred innovation with crypto-friendly policies like forming a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a crypto task force. World Liberty Financial (WLF), another Trump family entity, has recently struck global partnerships. The company partnered with the Pakistan Crypto Council to boost digital asset adoption and accelerate Bitcoin innovation. “The WLF … has signed a landmark Letter of Intent with the PCC to accelerate blockchain innovation, stablecoin adoption and decentralised finance integration across Pakistan,” the statement read. This month, USD1, WLF stablecoin facilitated MGX, Abu Dhabi’s investment firm $2 billion venture into Binance. The move sparked diverse reactions with industry experts projecting more institutional backing for the stablecoin while Democratic lawmakers called for investigations into Trump’s crypto dealings. Recall that Trump launched a meme coin before his inauguration and promised to make the United States the world’s Bitcoin capital. Institutional Investors Are Not Slowing Down Large-scale holders pushed Bitcoin price to an all-time high above $111k and are not showing fear signals.
