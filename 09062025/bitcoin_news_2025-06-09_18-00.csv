2025-06-09T15:36:53,"Presidential Crypto Push: Trump Media’s $3 Billion Fundraise Could Spark Institutional FOMO","Trump Media & Technology Group is plotting a $3 billion raise to purchase Bitcoin (BTC) and several altcoins. The move will see President Trump’s backed entities make deeper inroads into the crypto asset markets. Institutional investors increase their appetite for crypto products, leading to a new cycle as prices flash new highs. Trump Media Readies Huge Purchase According to sources familiar with the matter, Trump Media Group, the firm behind Truth Social, plans a $3 billion raise to buy multiple crypto assets. The Financial Times reported that the company seeks to raise $2 billion in equity and $1 billion in a convertible bond sale . If the deal goes through, Trump-related companies will extend their foray into digital assets to the delight of most crypto users. President Trump’s backing has fueled institutional and retail sentiments since the start of his second term in the White House. In January, Trump Media announced plans to roll out a fintech arm as part of a crypto-linked diversification process. At the time, the firm sought to purchase $250 million of digital assets and subsequently struck a deal with Crypto.com. Since his inauguration, the President has spurred innovation with crypto-friendly policies like forming a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a crypto task force. World Liberty Financial (WLF), another Trump family entity, has recently struck global partnerships. The company partnered with the Pakistan Crypto Council to boost digital asset adoption and accelerate Bitcoin innovation. “The WLF … has signed a landmark Letter of Intent with the PCC to accelerate blockchain innovation, stablecoin adoption and decentralised finance integration across Pakistan,” the statement read. This month, USD1, WLF stablecoin facilitated MGX, Abu Dhabi’s investment firm $2 billion venture into Binance. The move sparked diverse reactions with industry experts projecting more institutional backing for the stablecoin while Democratic lawmakers called for investigations into Trump’s crypto dealings. Recall that Trump launched a meme coin before his inauguration and promised to make the United States the world’s Bitcoin capital. Institutional Investors Are Not Slowing Down Large-scale holders pushed Bitcoin price to an all-time high above $111k and are not showing fear signals. Michael Saylor’s Strategy bagged an additional 4,020 BTC, taking total holdings to 580,250 bought at an average price of $69,979.

2025-06-09T15:34:49,"How Neo Pepe $NEOP’s Launch Could Shape Crypto Investing Strategies","Savvy Crypto Enthusiasts Pay Attention Since the beginning of 2025, crypto investors have faced a crypto market filled with opportunities, but few projects have attracted so much anticipation as Neo Pepe ($NEOP). As blockchain technology adoption grows, the crypto industry has become complex and competitive. Investors are now looking for projects that promise rewards, development, and decentralization. Neo Pepe is a project that focuses on meme coins with serious actions against centralized traditional platforms. Neo Pepe presents a strong movement, community backing, and profitable interest rates. Investors have also been monitoring its presale because of its plans to change the blockchain investment ecosystem and redefine crypto strategies. Boundless Excitement Surrounding Neo Pepe The excitement surrounding the Neo Pepe project is not built on hype–it is grounded in the platform’s design and the involvement of its community. Its presale structure provides profits for early investors, rewarding them as the price of the token continues to rise. In addition, the platform’s auto-liquidity and governance mechanism positions Neo Pepe not as another opportunity to make profits, but as a foundational digital asset that will be in the market for the long term. With this approach, Neo Pepe is in line with what investors want, providing them with security and dynamism in an unpredictable market. Those interested in the opportunity to make profits from tokens with potential should consider purchasing this digital asset. Mind-blowing Tokenomics Revealed Neo Pepe’s tokenomics have been designed to push community engagement, sustain the token’s growth, and increase investor confidence in the project. Its presale is structured across 16 phases, offering investors the opportunity to enter from a price of $0.05 to $0.16, with the developers targeting a total fundraising of $50 million. Step Action Quick Guide 1 Wallet Setup Get ERC-20 wallet (e.g., MetaMask) 2 Fund Wallet Add ETH, USDT, or USDC from an exchange 3 Connect to Presale Go to NeoPepe.ai and connect 4 Purchase Tokens Swap ETH/USDT/USDC for $NEOP tokens 5 Confirm Transaction Verify details and approve transaction 6 Secure Storage Store tokens securely in your wallet After its launch, $NEOP will unlock hourly, ensuring immediate circulation and avoiding price volatility, a feature that is expected to attract investors. In addition, every transaction is expected to add 2.5% to the liquidity, ensuring that a portion of its LP tokens are burnt to stabilize the price of the token and boost investor assurance. Neo Pepe has also adopted a community governance model, allowing holders to vote on several aspects concerning the project, including which exchanges should list $NEOP next, showing that the platfhe platform is decentralized. Unbeatable Market Advantage Neo Pepe has outperformed most presales, including Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) and Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL). Unlike Bitcoin Pepe’s focus on only the meme narrative, Neo Pepe is mixing that meme coin narrative with a move towards decentralization and financial freedom. In comparison to Bitcoin Bull, Neo Pepe’s hourly unlock and transparent liquidity protocol ensures the price of the token is stable. Such developments make Neo Pepe a promising investment and a standard for projects looking to launch tokens in the future. Furthermore, Neo Pepe also had a better advantage than established projects like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) due to its governance and liquidity moves. While Ethereum has been dominating most networks in the crypto market, its high transaction fees remain an issue. Also, the liquidity process and low entry of Neo Pepe allow investors to take advantage of its present price. BNB’s reliance on centralized exchanges puts it a little bit below Neo Pepe, which focuses on its community governance, allowing investors to make decisions. Swift Entry to Neo Pepe Entering the project at this early stage requires a straightforward process: You need to set up a wallet compatible with ERC-20 tokens like MetaMask. You will need to deposit funds in USDT, USDC, or ETH. Connect your wallet using the Neo Pepe presale platform. Swap your choice of crypto for $NEOP Confirm the transaction details and keep your tokens secure. Each step is easy, allowing even new investors to participate in the presale. In addition, the platform also has guides and resources to support new users readily available, showing its commitment to stress-free investments. Ironclad Value Proposition Neo Pepe is positioning itself as one of the best crypto investments in the crypto market. It is taking advantage of the power of decentralization, its tokenomics, and community governance. Its platform is also designed to eliminate traditional financial challenges, making it the best choice in the crypto industry. Investors need tokens that are not just built on hype but are also designed to adapt to the market conditions. Neo Pepe solves this problem, using the best mechanisms to protect investor wealth while helping its token grow. Traders that invest in this project will not just be getting immediate rewards but also strong long-term profits. Unveiling Crypto’s Next Big Shift Neo Pepe’s launch is expected to set the stage for how crypto investment opportunities are created in the industry, setting the standards for transparency, liquidity, and community engagement. Investors might be moving towards projects that provide clear values while helping their community. Such a move could push existing and new projects to adopt similar structures, changing the standards investors use when seeking out new assets. As the market continues to develop, Neo Pepe represents the shift investors have been looking for. Its launch is expected to be a turning point in crypto investments, pushing investors to rethink their investment strategies. For investors looking to explore the platform and engage directly with Neo Pepe’s community, materials are available to provide insights into the next steps. Participation in this best new crypto presale could also help your portfolio, ensuring you enjoy developments in the crypto market.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/how-neo-pepe-neops-launch-could-shape-crypto-investing-strategies/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Press Release",cryptocompare

2025-06-09T15:30:17,"Experts Reveal The 4 Most Undervalued Cryptos In June 2025: Dogecoin, Chainlink, Remittix and Pi Network","According to a group of leading analysts, even though Dogecoin, Chainlink, Remittix, and Pi Network seem unlikely together, they are considered the most undervalued cryptos in June 2025. Dogecoin is being held back by a huge liquidity wall, Chainlink is much lower than its promise to institutions, and Remittix , backed by $15.6 million raised, is just $2.4 million short of its $18 million soft-cap and provides a cheap way to use PayFi in the real world. Furthermore, Pi Network’s chart suggests that a surprise rebound will take place as soon as its token-unlock phase ends. Dogecoin: Liquidity Walls and Classic Reversal Setups Source: Alphratical . DOGE currently trades near $0.19 People engaged in Dogecoin trading are closely watching Alphractal’s heat-map, where they see a $380 million group of short liquidations waiting at $0.50. Over time, Dogecoin has always seen a big surge after briefly dropping below such a liquidity level. A new inverse Head-and-Shoulders shape is visible on the chart; the price hit the $0.17 support level, revisited it, and started using it as support. On the Elliott Wave theory, analysts have Dogecoin in Wave 4, and Wave 5 may send the price past the half-dollar level. People who buy coins continue to look at the coin’s green support band, which has remained steady since 2021. A climb in Bitcoin could lead to a surge in buyers among the short-sellers, causing Dogecoin to shoot up fast and reach the heights it saw in 2021. However, there’s another question: Will investors pick Dogecoin again, or should they focus on other low-cost projects that have more use? It could decide if Dogecoin once again becomes the top meme-coin or if PayFi joins it as a main story in the crypto world. Chainlink: Institutional Bridges to the Real-World Asset Boom Source: coingecko. Chainlink currently trades near $13.93 Chainlink keeps attracting institutional investments, and each news story makes it clear that the price near $13.94 is still a bargain. Mentioning tokenized real estate in fiat by BlackRock means Chainlink oracles are making it possible for off-line payments to affect on-chain ownership records. Using Chainlink CCIP, Maple Finance makes it possible for liquidity to move between Solana and 57 other blockchains, something that Chainlink is the only one able to do on a large scale. Even the regulators agree: EU MiCA programs mention Chainlink’s data standards, and the SEC has started including Chainlink in its drafts on RWA. The market price is not catching up to expectations; the 50-day SMA is stopping any major gains and traders seek a close above $14.00. Whenever volume increases, Chainlink is usually the first to rise, thanks to Bitcoin or Ethereum. Remittix: The Wallet-Ready PayFi Gem Racing Past XRP Dogecoin tries to find more investors while Chainlink searches for more users, but Remittix is already getting momentum. The new wallet introduced by the team lets Bitcoin, Ether, or XRP be transferred to a bank account in under ten seconds and for very little cost. PayFi uses Ethereum gas and returns micro-fees to RTX holders, thereby removing tokens every day. As bonuses are set to end in less than two weeks, buyers who use $2.4 million get an extra 50 percent tokens and pay only about 5 cents per token. PayFi’s public launch is scheduled for Q3 2025, and two deals in Asia and Latin America are being investigated by due diligence. The fact that early whales have moved from $0.08 to one dollar with a 12× increase shows that Remittix could easily reach this milestone. If we finish the soft-cap in this month, marketing and trading will be activated as soon as the wallet is live, so RTX will be ahead of similar coins in the market. Pi Network: Triple-Bottom Tension Versus Token-Unlock Gravity Source: crypto.news . PI currently trades near $0.63 Pi Network is now watched by contrarians because of its slanted triple-bottom and bullish divergence on the eight-hour chart. Bulls are counting on these signals to cause a big move, but the amount of tokens being released, 68 million this week and 275 million more in the next 30 days, makes everything more complicated. Net exchange inflows indicate that people are selling and withdrawing coins, but Banxa’s link to fiat and a new $100 million fund for Pi Network Ventures should attract additional developers. Pi can reach the same level of growth as Dogecoin, Chainlink, or Remittix by being listed on major exchanges, which has not happened yet. Why Remittix Tops June’s Value List If Dogecoin’s liquidity overhead is finally removed, its price could skyrocket; Chainlink is in a good position to lead in tokenization, and Pi Network could see its chart turn up if pressure to unlock eases. However, only Remittix has a very low entry point, plus a specific launch date, constant burning, and a closing window for bonuses that ensures the project will be scarce right away. When it comes to the market’s focus on gains and key events, Remittix leaves June’s top crypto far behind, so now is the best time to invest in RTX before PayFi takes off and others follow from behind.

Tether mints $1B USDT, fueling ongoing debates about stablecoins’ impact on Bitcoin prices. Ripple CTO David “JoelKatz” Schwartz has responded to several questions on social media about his involvement with Evan “all the money” Schwartz. The user “DegenXRPHolder” wondered if the two had a relationship. Schwartz pointed out that just because they have the same last name, they are not related. However, he acknowledged that there is another Evan connected to Interledger who is a member of his family. The discussion then shifted to the current functioning of Interledger. Schwartz stated that the protocol may have been too advanced for its time. He added that being too soon can sometimes be as bad as being too late. In his view, the team made some strategic mistakes, though he noted they weren’t significant enough to impact the project’s long-term potential seriously.

2025-06-09T15:20:28,"Unlocking Korean Crypto Community Trends: Top Tokens Revealed","BitcoinWorld Unlocking Korean Crypto Community Trends: Top Tokens Revealed The South Korean market holds significant sway in the global cryptocurrency landscape. Known for its active trading community and keen interest in emerging digital assets, tracking sentiment and popular topics within the Korean crypto community can offer valuable insights into potential market movements and developing narratives. This report delves into the data from Bitcoin World’s K-Community for the week of May 29 to June 4, highlighting the top crypto tokens that captured the community’s attention, both in terms of search interest and active discussion. What Were the Top Crypto Tokens Searched? Search volume often indicates initial interest or research into a particular asset. It shows what people are actively looking up, perhaps considering for investment or simply trying to understand. For the specified week, the Bitcoin World data reveals a clear hierarchy in search interest among the K-Community crypto users. Here are the tokens that saw the highest search counts: Rank Token Search Count 1 XRP 39,809 2 BTC 18,379 3 ETH 17,312 4 UXLINK 10,689 5 SOPH 9,736 6 WCT 9,460 7 POKT 7,707 8 ONDO 7,495 9 LPT 7,221 10 ME 5,702 It’s immediately apparent that XRP dominated search queries by a significant margin. While Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) consistently hold high positions due to their market leadership, XRP’s prominence suggests ongoing interest, likely tied to its legal developments or specific news circulating within the community. The presence of tokens like UXLINK, SOPH, WCT, POKT, ONDO, LPT, and ME in the top searched list indicates strong curiosity around these specific altcoins during this period. These could be projects with recent news, upcoming events, or simply gaining traction within certain K-Community circles. Which Tokens Were Most Discussed in the K-Community? Mentions, on the other hand, reflect active discussion and sentiment within the community forums and chats. This data provides a snapshot of what people are talking about, debating, or sharing opinions on. The list of most mentioned tokens offers a slightly different perspective on K-Community crypto focus areas for the same week: Rank Token Mention Count 1 BTC 1,907 2 ETH 724 3 TRUMP 204 4 XRP 168 5 SOL 161 6 UXLINK 114 7 SOPH 82 8 PEPE 71 9 STMX 60 10 ME 59 Here, BTC and ETH reclaim the top spots, reinforcing their status as central discussion points in any crypto community. Interestingly, TRUMP appears at number three, highlighting the community’s engagement with politically-themed tokens or broader political discussions intersecting with crypto. XRP is still present but much lower than its search rank, suggesting high initial curiosity but perhaps less ongoing debate compared to BTC or ETH. Solana (SOL) and Pepe (PEPE) also enter the top mentioned list, indicating discussions around the Solana ecosystem and the enduring popularity of memecoins. UXLINK, SOPH, and ME appear on both lists, showing consistent interest from initial search to active discussion. Comparing Search vs. Mention Data: What Does it Reveal About Crypto Trends Korea? Analyzing both lists side-by-side provides deeper insights into the crypto trends Korea . The discrepancy between search and mention volume for certain tokens is particularly telling. XRP’s high search volume but moderate mention volume could imply that many users were researching it, perhaps due to recent news or price movements, but the active conversation wasn’t as intense as for BTC or ETH. Conversely, BTC and ETH are consistently high on both lists, signifying their foundational role in community discussions and research. The appearance of tokens like TRUMP and PEPE solely on the mentioned list (or significantly higher on mentioned than searched) suggests that these are topics driven more by current narratives, social buzz, or speculative interest being actively discussed rather than fundamental research. Tokens like UXLINK, SOPH, and ME appearing on both lists indicate projects that are successfully generating both curiosity and active conversation within the Korean crypto community . Understanding these differences helps paint a more nuanced picture of community interest. High search volume might signal potential future discussion or investment, while high mention volume indicates where the current energy and sentiment lie. Actionable Insights from Bitcoin World Data For anyone looking to understand or engage with the Korean crypto market, this Bitcoin World data offers valuable clues. Tracking these lists weekly can help identify: Emerging Narratives: The sudden appearance of specific altcoins or token categories (like political tokens or memecoins) in the top lists can signal shifting interests or new trends gaining traction. Key Discussion Points: High mention volumes indicate what the community is actively debating, which can be a proxy for sentiment or areas of potential volatility. Research Focus: High search volumes show what users are actively trying to learn about, pointing to potential areas of future investment or adoption. This data is a snapshot and should be used as a starting point for further research. It highlights which tokens are top-of-mind for the K-Community crypto users, but understanding *why* they are popular requires diving into the specific news, events, and discussions surrounding those tokens during that period. Summary: Navigating Korean Crypto Trends The week of May 29 to June 4 provided a fascinating look into the priorities of the South Korean Korean crypto community . While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain evergreen topics, the data clearly showed strong interest in XRP searches and active discussions around diverse tokens ranging from newer altcoins like UXLINK and SOPH to narrative-driven assets like TRUMP and PEPE. By analyzing both search and mention data from platforms like Bitcoin World, observers can gain a competitive edge in understanding the dynamic and influential Korean market, potentially spotting top crypto tokens and emerging crypto trends Korea before they become globally apparent.

2025-06-09T15:19:24,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Crosses $107,000 As Momentum Returns","Bitcoin (BTC) has registered a significant uptick after starting the day on a sluggish note. The flagship cryptocurrency reclaimed $107,000 as momentum returned after a subdued weekend that saw the price retake $105,000. However, analysts have warned that BTC still risks a drop below $105,000, depending on the outcome of US-China trade talks. BTC is up over 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $107,192. However, US CPI and PPI numbers could help bears retake control. Strategy Revises STRD Preferred Stock Offering Strategy has increased its $250 million offering of perpetual Stride preferred stock to $1 billion. It also increased the product’s pricing. Strategy announced the changes in a company blog post published on Friday. The product will pay investors a 10% non-cumulative dividend and will be offered at $85 per share. The offering will allow Strategy to raise $979 million to fund Bitcoin purchases. STRD is the third preferred stock established by the company this year, besides the STRF and STRK products. Each stock offering has unique features and benefits, including redemption features and the ability for dividends to accrue. Strategy had initially planned to offer STRD to investors at $100 per share. STRD does not allow for the accrual of missed dividend payments, unlike Strategy’s STRF offering. It also does not allow an investor to convert the preferred stock into common shares at a later date. The stock is also non-callable for life, meaning it has no associated maturity date. Strategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor stated, ""It's our high-yield credit instrument. Compared to STRK or STRF, it should be a higher-yielding preferred instrument.” Saylor also stated that the STRD stock has limited sensitivity to the Bitcoin price. STRD shareholders will rank behind STRF and STRK holders but come before common shareholders. Saylor added, “STRD represents the fourth gear in our Bitcoin engine. The point of our engine is to generate BTC torque via surgical management of our [at-the-money offering programs].” Strategy currently holds 580,995 BTC worth over $60 billion. The Blockchain Group Plans $340 Million Raise For Bitcoin Treasury Paris-based crypto company The Blockchain Group is planning to raise $340 million for its Bitcoin treasury, indicating growing institutional adoption of crypto in Europe. The Blockchain Group claims to be Europe’s first Bitcoin treasury company. The $340 million fundraise is inspired by the US practice of “At the Market” offerings. Shares will be sold at market conditions initiated by the company’s counterparty. The group will carry out the raise in tranches, with prices based on the “higher of the previous day’s closing price or the volume-weighted average price,” capped at 21% of the day’s trading volume. The announcement comes only a week after the group announced the acquisition of $68 million worth of Bitcoin, taking its total Bitcoin holdings to 1,471 BTC . Strategic Treasuries Driving Bitcoin Higher Bitcoin (BTC) has been consolidating since the last week of May, trading around $105,000. However, it saw a substantial decline last week when it plunged to a low of $100,424 before recovering and reclaiming $105,000 over the weekend. Despite Bitcoin’s recent sluggishness, growing institutional adoption and strategic treasury moves have anchored the long-term bullish sentiment around the asset. Stella Zlatareva, Nexo dispatch editor, stated, “Strategic buys, treasury allocations, and infrastructure investment paint a picture of long-term confidence — regardless of short-term price action.” According to Zlatareva, Bitcoin’s recovery from $100,000 suggests high resilience levels with “no signs of mass deleveraging or forced selling.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is witnessing a sharp uptick during the ongoing session as bullish sentiment takes hold. The flagship cryptocurrency is up nearly 2% and has reclaimed $107,000 after a sluggish start to the week. Despite the jump, analysts have warned BTC risks a drop below $105,000, with US-China trade talks setting the tone for the week. Dominick John, an analyst at Kronos Research, stated, “Trading above $105K signals strength, but the structure remains fragile. With the Fear & Greed Index at 55, sentiment has balanced markets in a wait-and-see mode, looking for a macro trigger or confirmation of trend.” Traders are waiting for key inflation data, with the CPI due on Wednesday and the PPI set to be released on Thursday. Recent job data came in stronger than expected, and economists have predicted CPI inflation data to be higher at 2.5%, up from 2.3% last month, thanks to escalating trade tensions. PPI data is also predicted to be higher at 2.6%, up from the previous month’s 2.4%. Market watchers are hopeful of a fresh price increase after BTC’s resurgence. However, it faces immediate resistance around $107,600. A close above this level could send the price to $110,000 or higher. BTC registered a sharp drop on Thursday (May 29), dropping over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,662. Sellers retained control as the price fell 1.51% on Friday, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,067. BTC recovered over the weekend, rising 0.69% on Saturday and nearly 1% on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,779. The price plunged to an intraday low of $103,768 on Monday. It recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $105,902. However, BTC lost momentum on Tuesday, falling 0.44% to $105,436. Source: TradingView Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell almost 1%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,752. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC plunged 3%, dropping to a low of $100,424 before settling at $101,614. However, it rebounded on Friday, rising nearly 3% to $104,378. Buyers retained control on Saturday as the price rose 1.15% to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,575. BTC continued to push higher on Sunday, registering a marginal increase to end the weekend at $105,784. The current session has seen bullish sentiment return, with the price up almost 2%, trading around $107,670. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-09T15:10:36,"Urgent: Nearly Half of Korean Crypto Investors Demand Tax Relief from New Government","BitcoinWorld Urgent: Nearly Half of Korean Crypto Investors Demand Tax Relief from New Government Are you a crypto enthusiast wondering what’s happening in one of Asia’s major crypto markets? Recent insights from a survey shed light on the sentiment and crucial policy priorities of Korean crypto investors , particularly regarding the contentious issue of cryptocurrency taxation under the new administration. Understanding Korean Crypto Investors ‘ Sentiment A weekly survey tracking trends among South Korean cryptocurrency investors, conducted by Bitcoin World and Cratos from June 4 to 6, provided valuable data on market expectations and policy preferences. The survey captured the views of a significant portion of the market, offering a snapshot of investor sentiment. Interestingly, the optimism around Bitcoin’s immediate future saw a slight dip compared to the previous week: Expecting Increase/Significant Jump: 41.7% (down from 51.9% last week) Predicting Stable Market: 25.3% (down from 33.9% last week) Anticipating Decline/Sharp Drop: 33.0% (up significantly from 14.2% last week) This shift indicates a more cautious short-term outlook for Bitcoin price South Korea , with a notable increase in those expecting a downturn. Overall market sentiment was mixed, leaning towards neutral, though fear slightly outweighed optimism: Neutral: 37% Optimistic/Extreme Optimism: 30.6% Fear/Extreme Fear: 32.4% What Do Investors Want from South Korea Crypto Policy ? With South Korea’s 21st president recently taking office, the survey also delved into the crypto-related policies investors hope the new administration will prioritize. The results were striking and highlighted key areas of concern and opportunity for the market. The overwhelming top priority for nearly half of the respondents was related to taxation: Delay or Exempt Cryptocurrency Taxes: 48.8% Stronger Investor Protection: 25.9% Relaxed Regulations (ICOs, Crypto ETFs): 13% Promoting Security Token Offerings (STOs): 6.5% Introduction of Korean Won-Pegged Stablecoins: 5.8% This clearly shows that addressing the South Korea crypto tax framework is the most pressing issue for investors. The current plan to tax crypto gains has been a point of contention, and investors are vocal in their desire for either a delay in implementation or a complete exemption. The Crucial Call for South Korea Crypto Tax Reform The fact that nearly half of Korean crypto investors are prioritizing tax relief sends a strong message to the new government. Implementing a fair and clear taxation system is crucial for the growth and stability of the market, but investors appear to feel that the current proposals may be premature or overly burdensome. Delaying the tax could allow the market and regulatory framework to mature further, while exemption would signal a more crypto-friendly stance, potentially attracting more investment and innovation. While tax is paramount, the significant support for stronger investor protection (over a quarter of respondents) underscores the need for robust safeguards in the rapidly evolving crypto space. The call for relaxed regulations, particularly regarding ICOs and crypto ETFs, indicates a desire for greater market access and diversification options currently limited under existing rules. Support for STOs and stablecoins points to interest in specific, potentially regulated, areas of the crypto ecosystem. These survey results provide valuable insights into the expectations of Korean crypto investors and the key areas the new administration needs to consider as it shapes future crypto regulation South Korea . How the government responds to these calls, especially concerning the South Korea crypto tax , will likely have a significant impact on the local market’s trajectory.

2025-06-09T15:09:48,"BTC, Ether, XRP, Solana, USDT, RLUSD — Social Media is Going Crazy for These 6 Crypto Assets, Here’s Why","The week ended on a promising note for several cryptocurrencies as social sentiments turned positive this Thursday. According to data from the on-chain analytical platform Santiment, market participants are collectively expressing excitement about several crypto assets, notably BTC , ETH , XRP , SOL , USDT, and RLUSD . Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin appears to be trending due to an increase in bullish BTC price predictions despite the asset’s drop to $100,000, treasury acquisition by leading companies, and new Spot Bitcoin ETF filings, among other reasons. Notably, President Trump’s Truth Social announced the launch of a Spot Bitcoin ETF, with excerpts of the filing noting that “The assets of the Trust consist primarily of bitcoin held by a custodian on behalf of the Trust.” Similarly, conversations regarding ETH and the Ethereum blockchain highlight its staking security model and rising institutional interest rates, with key players like Grayscale, BlackRock, and Fidelity backing ETH. Right behind ETH, XRP, and SOL are now leading altcoin-based conversations. While cross-border payment discourse and institutional adoption by Ripple partners are making up a huge part of the ongoing discussions for XRP, the recent move by a Chinese-based firm, Webus, to raise $300 million for an XRP treasury plan has become a trending topic. On the other hand, Solana’s high transaction speed and significant Total Value Locked (TVL), the Layer-1 blockchain and its native token SOL have earned it a spot in the conversation pit this week, with traders and investors showing keen interest in SOL. Ripple’s RLUSD and Tether’s USD are stablecoins heating up this week.

2025-06-09T15:08:20,"Interview | Bitcoin price target hinges on Fed pivot and ETF flows: Bitunix analyst","In a conversation with Dean Chen, Analyst at Bitunix, we discussed key macroeconomic and crypto market developments after a week of increased volatility and policy speculation. With U.S. private payroll growth missing expectations and U.S. President Trump doubling down on calls for rate cuts, Chen provided thoughtful insights into how these dynamics could impact Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other digital assets. As markets weigh the prospect of a Fed pivot against rising recession risks, Chen outlined how sentiment-driven price moves could either boost or destabilize crypto in the short term. We also explored Bitcoin’s evolving role during economic downturns, Ethereum’s ( ETH ) relative underperformance, and what’s really behind the recent institutional-led crypto rally. Chen broke down the conditions needed to support bullish BTC forecasts, the significance of crypto ETFs, and the trade-offs between direct asset ownership and traditional vehicles. As regulatory momentum builds in Washington and state-backed stablecoins emerge, Chen’s analysis helps clarify how Bitunix and the broader market are preparing for a new era of institutional integration and policy clarity. Below is the full Q&A with Dean Chen. Editor’s note: This interview was conducted prior to the release of the U.S. non-farm payrolls report referenced in the first question. crypto.news: The US labor market is flashing signs of cooling, private payrolls rose just 37,000 in May vs. 110,000 expected (a two-year low). This weakness has even prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to renew pressure on the Fed for rate cuts. If the upcoming non-farm payrolls report this Friday also dramatically undershoots expectations, what impact do you anticipate on Bitcoin and the broader crypto market? Would another weak jobs print prove to be a major catalyst for crypto on hopes of an earlier Fed pivot, or could it spook investors about the economy and actually hurt risk assets like crypto in the short term? Dean Chen: If the data shows weakness, it could temporarily boost market expectations of an early Fed rate cut, as lower rates typically increase liquidity and enhance the appeal of risk assets, thereby driving crypto prices higher. However, overly weak data could also trigger concerns about the overall health of the economy, potentially signaling a recession risk and prompting investors to shift toward safer assets. As such, the market reaction could be mixed. In this context, if markets believe the Fed will act quickly to support the economy, optimism around a “Fed pivot” may dominate sentiment, pushing crypto prices upward. CN: Trump argues the U.S. economy is in a “downward spiral”, pushing for immediate rate cuts. Markets are already pricing in at least one Fed rate cut by September. If the economy does slip toward recession, do you expect Bitcoin to behave more like digital gold (rallying as a safe haven) or like a high-risk asset (falling alongside stocks)? In 2022, crypto tumbled during recession fears despite high inflation, which challenged the “inflation hedge” thesis. Has Bitcoin proven itself yet as a recession-resistant asset, or is its fate still tied to economic growth and liquidity? DC: Bitcoin has so far behaved more like a high-risk asset than a safe-haven “digital gold” during economic downturns. The experience of 2022 showed that even amid high inflation, crypto assets fell sharply, challenging the narrative of Bitcoin as an “inflation hedge.” Bitcoin’s value fluctuations are closely tied to global liquidity, investor risk appetite, and economic growth. In times of economic contraction, investors typically turn to cash or traditional safe havens like gold and the U.S. dollar, rather than high-volatility assets like Bitcoin, indicating it has yet to prove itself as a recession-resistant asset. CN: We’ve seen extremely bullish calls from some market pundits calling for Bitcoin to hit $200,000 by the end of the year. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee goes even higher (although he always seemed to be an outlier) at $250,000 due to expanding liquidity and the post-halving supply squeeze. Do you agree with these optimistic targets? What fundamental drivers would need to materialize to justify Bitcoin climbing to ~$150,000+ DC: While a year-end Bitcoin price target of $200,000 or even $250,000 is exciting, I believe we should evaluate its feasibility with caution. To achieve a price above $150,000, several fundamental drivers must align. First, sustained institutional inflows—especially consistent net inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs—are crucial to support prices. Second, a pivot by global central banks toward monetary easing would inject liquidity into markets, favoring risk assets like Bitcoin. Additionally, the post-halving supply squeeze, if met with stable or growing demand, would further lift prices. The macroeconomic environment also plays a vital role. A “soft landing” scenario—where inflation is under control, economic growth slows, and the Fed cuts rates without triggering a recession—would be ideal for Bitcoin. On the regulatory front, clear and innovation-friendly crypto regulations in major economies would attract more traditional capital into the market. Lastly, technological advancements within the Bitcoin network and broader crypto ecosystem—such as greater adoption of the Lightning Network and the growth of DeFi applications—will increase Bitcoin’s utility and long-term value. While the outlook is optimistic, it should be approached with measured expectations. CN: While Bitcoin is still within striking distance of its all-time highs, Ethereum is still 40–50% below its record peak. Ethereum is down ~23% year-to-date despite the broader crypto recovery. Why do you think ETH has underperformed BTC in this cycle? Is it simply lagging and poised for a catch-up rally, or are there fundamental factors, like the post-Merge shift to staking, regulatory concerns around deeming ETH a security, competition from other L1s/L2s, that are keeping Ethereum’s gains more muted? Furthermore, with Ethereum’s network upgrades ongoing, what’s your outlook for ETH for the rest of the year? DC: Bitcoin, being the largest and most liquid cryptocurrency, typically attracts capital first during market upswings and serves as a “market indicator.” Ethereum often lags behind and catches up later once Bitcoin’s momentum is established. Following Ethereum’s Merge and transition to a Proof-of-Stake model, a large volume of ETH has been staked, reducing circulating supply and temporarily limiting price flexibility. This has likely led some speculative capital to flow into assets with higher short-term upside. On the regulatory front, uncertainty over whether ETH will be classified as a security by the U.S. SEC has suppressed institutional demand. Competition is another factor. Other Layer 1s (like Solana and Avalanche) and Layer 2 solutions (such as Arbitrum and Optimism) offer lower fees and higher throughput, diverting users and developers. Despite these headwinds, Ethereum’s long-term outlook remains strong. Its ongoing upgrades are significantly reducing Layer 2 transaction costs and enhancing scalability, reinforcing its network utility. Ethereum remains the backbone of DeFi and NFTs, backed by a vibrant developer ecosystem. As the market recovers, these use cases will continue driving ETH demand. In summary, Ethereum has long-term growth potential supported by its technical innovation, robust ecosystem, and improving scalability. If bullish sentiment persists, ETH may eventually follow BTC toward new highs. CN: We now have a plethora of crypto ETFs on the market, including a new Trump-branded “Truth Social Bitcoin ETF”. To what extent do you think the recent Bitcoin rally has been driven by institutional investors allocating via ETFs and other vehicles, versus retail traders? Do you think institutional adoption is reaching a tipping point that fundamentally changes market dynamics? DC: The recent Bitcoin rally has been largely driven by institutional investors allocating through ETFs and other structured products, rather than by retail traders alone. Institutional adoption is indeed approaching a critical inflection point. Increasing numbers of traditional asset managers, hedge funds, and even corporations are incorporating Bitcoin into their portfolios or balance sheets. This institutional capital not only helps stabilize market volatility but also strengthens Bitcoin’s legitimacy as an asset class. It marks a profound shift in market structure and sets the foundation for more sustainable long-term growth in the crypto space. CN: Why might an investor choose direct ownership of Bitcoin or other digital currencies over gaining exposure through ETFs or equities, and how do the trade-offs compare in terms of relative risk profiles, expected returns and correlation to the underlying asset? DC: Investors who prioritize true ownership, maximum control, and participation in on-chain ecosystems—and who are comfortable with the responsibility of self-custody—typically prefer direct ownership. On the other hand, those who seek exposure through familiar and regulated traditional financial instruments, and who prefer operational simplicity, may opt for ETFs or equities. Each method has trade-offs: direct ownership offers greater decentralization and autonomy but involves higher custody risk and complexity. ETFs provide convenience and regulatory protections but may carry tracking errors and lack full utility of the underlying digital asset. CN: After years of uncertainty and enforcement-driven policy, the U.S. is finally seeing moves toward clearer crypto regulation. In late May, lawmakers introduced the bipartisan Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025, which would split oversight between the SEC and CFTC and even provide safe harbors for DeFi protocols. And over at the SEC, the new Chairman Paul Atkins told Congress he will pursue “notice-and-comment” rulemaking (not just lawsuits) to craft “clear rules of the road” for crypto assets. How optimistic are you that we’ll see meaningful regulatory clarity in the near future? If comprehensive legislation like the CLARITY Act advances, and the SEC shifts to formal rulemaking, what impact would that have on the market and on firms like Bitunix? Are investors already pricing in a more friendly regulatory environment under the current administration, or is skepticism still warranted until actual laws and rules take effect? DC: I remain cautiously optimistic about achieving meaningful regulatory clarity in the U.S. in the near term. The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025 and new policy direction under SEC Chairman Paul Atkins represent strong momentum toward establishing a more defined regulatory framework for digital assets. This would be crucial for fostering innovation, attracting institutional capital, and protecting consumers. That said, challenges remain. Legislative complexity and diverging stakeholder interests may slow progress, and even after passage, rule implementation could take time. For platforms like Bitunix, this legislation offers several positives. It would provide legal certainty for digital asset trading, allowing for long-term planning and expansion. Clear regulations would also attract more traditional financial participants, accelerating market growth and ecosystem development. Although initial compliance costs may rise, this shift would ultimately enhance competitiveness and build trust. Transparent and rigorous regulation would boost Bitunix’s credibility and reputation in the market. While expectations of friendlier regulation are growing, caution is still warranted. Only once clear and enforceable legal frameworks are in place can the market fully price in the implications. CN: Stablecoins continue to play a critical role in crypto markets, and now they’re entering mainstream finance. Notably, Circle has filed for an IPO on the NYSE aiming for roughly a $6 billion valuation. At the same time, novel experiments are emerging: the state of Wyoming is launching a fully-reserved, fiat-backed “Wyoming Stable Token” in July, the first state-issued stablecoin in the US. What do these developments signal about the future of stablecoins? Does Circle going public indicate that regulated stablecoin providers will become as common as banks, integrating with traditional markets? How might a government or central-bank-linked stablecoin (whether a state token like WYST or a potential Fed CBDC down the line) compete with private coins like USDC or Tether? And speaking of Tether, it’s still the market’s largest stablecoin, do you see any risks around USDT’s dominance in a more regulated future, or will it continue to thrive despite perennial transparency concerns? DC: Stablecoins are playing an increasingly vital role in both crypto markets and mainstream finance, signaling their potential to become foundational infrastructure for global payments and settlement. Circle’s IPO highlights how seriously Wall Street now takes regulated stablecoin providers, accelerating the convergence of crypto and traditional finance. Going forward, legitimacy and regulatory compliance will be key drivers of mainstream adoption. Government- or central bank-issued stablecoins—like WYST or a future Fed CBDC—have sovereign trust advantages and benefit from regulatory clarity, making them easier to integrate into existing financial systems. This presents competitive pressure for private stablecoins like USDC and USDT. To remain competitive, private issuers will need to enhance reserve transparency and innovate in services, particularly in blockchain-native applications and cross-border payments. Tether, despite being the largest stablecoin, may face regulatory risks if it doesn’t address transparency concerns. In a more regulated environment, USDT will either need to adjust its reserve practices to meet rising disclosure standards or focus on markets with less stringent oversight.",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/interview-bitcoin-price-target-hinges-on-fed-pivot-and-etf-flows-bitunix-analyst/,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Interviews|Bitcoin|Bitcoin ETF|Donald Trump|ETF|Ethereum|Federal Reserve",cryptocompare
2025-06-09T15:07:08,"Bitcoin (BTC) Summer Rally Shelved! Analysis Firm Points to This Month for Rally!","Bitcoin broke new records in recent weeks, exceeding $111,000. However, BTC, which has withstood the subsequent pullbacks well, is now moving within a certain range. At this point, while the expectations for an increase are decreasing, the question of “Will there be a summer rally in BTC and altcoins?” comes to the fore with the arrival of the summer months. Analyzing the current state of Bitcoin, QCP Capital said that investors have postponed their rally expectations to September. Analysts stated that Bitcoin volatility has decreased as the market shows signs of fatigue, and that volatility has reached yearly lows as the BTC price movement remains stuck in a certain range. Analysts said that historical data suggests that Bitcoin volatility could fall further by July, and that the price could also fall. Analysts have warned that Bitcoin’s price could fall sharply as no clear bullish catalyst is in sight and recent macro events have failed to generate momentum. QCP analysts also noted that investors are postponing bullish bets, pushing back July options to September. Without a break above $110,000 or below $100,000, Bitcoin is more likely to remain in its current range, analysts say. All eyes will be on the US CPI and PPI data to be released this week for any upward or downward movements in Bitcoin. “A clean break below $100,000 or above $110,000 would likely rekindle broader market interest, but we do not currently see any obvious near-term catalysts to drive such a move. So we expect Bitcoin to move within a certain range. Investors are also uncertain about Bitcoin’s movements. Options flows over the past week also reflect this indecision. We have seen expectations for a July peak being postponed until September. Key events to watch this week: US CPI on Wednesday, US PPI on Thursday, Jobless Claims *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-09T14:56:13,"Analyst Says This Rejection Is Dangerous for Bitcoin","Bitcoin (BTC) is once again at a crucial technical crossroads, with market participants closely watching the $106,900 resistance level. According to Ali, a respected crypto analyst known for his data-driven insights on X, Bitcoin’s current price behavior demands caution. In a recent post, he emphasized the significance of this key threshold, warning that a failure to break above it convincingly could trigger a substantial retracement for the flagship cryptocurrency. A Decisive Resistance Barrier At the heart of Ali’s analysis is the $106,900 price level, which has emerged as a decisive resistance point for Bitcoin. While BTC has made several attempts to reclaim this territory, each rally toward this zone has been met with increasing selling pressure. Wait for a sustained close above $106,900 before you turn bullish on #Bitcoin $BTC because a rejection here could send it back to $105,000 or even $103,500. pic.twitter.com/ojwWu7pKdG — Ali (@ali_charts) June 9, 2025 Ali urges traders and investors to refrain from a bullish stance until the asset can produce a sustained close above this threshold. His caution stems from the likelihood that rejection at this level could result in a sharp correction, potentially driving the price down to $105,000, or even lower, toward $103,500. This resistance has become a psychological and technical barrier, particularly as Bitcoin continues to trade in a relatively tight range amid broader market uncertainty. A clean break and hold above $106,900, according to Ali, would signify renewed bullish momentum and likely open the door to higher highs. However, absent that confirmation, the risk of downside cannot be overlooked. Short-Term Risk of Rejection Ali’s post is backed by an on-chain and technical overview that suggests bearish undertones beneath Bitcoin’s surface-level stability. While volatility remains suppressed relative to the explosive moves witnessed earlier in the year, the threat of a sudden downturn looms. If the price is rejected at $106,900, it would confirm bearish dominance at this resistance level and potentially trigger a wave of sell-offs from traders who were anticipating a breakout. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 His warning comes at a time when Bitcoin is already under pressure from several macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. Regulatory uncertainty in key markets, investor repositioning amid changing U.S. interest rate expectations, and fluctuating institutional inflows have all contributed to Bitcoin’s recent hesitations. These elements, combined with the technical resistance described by Ali, reinforce the idea that a premature bullish bias could lead to painful consequences. Market Context and Broader Implications The stakes are particularly high at this juncture . A successful breakout would likely boost investor confidence, attracting new institutional investment and improving overall market sentiment. Conversely, a failed attempt to break higher could reinforce bearish structures on higher timeframes, leading to a reevaluation of near-term bullish theses. It is also worth noting that this rejection point aligns with liquidity zones that have historically seen high-volume rejections, suggesting that large entities might be using this level to offload or short BTC positions. If this behavior continues, it could further weaken Bitcoin’s short-term outlook. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-06-09T14:54:15,"Tether to start open-sourcing its Bitcoin mining OS","Stablecoin issuer Tether plans to open-source its Bitcoin Mining Operating System, allowing companies of all sizes to access and operate mining infrastructure independently, without relying on proprietary third-party software. The announcement was made by Tether ( USDT ) CEO Paolo Ardoino, who described the initiative as a push to “make mining great again.” Tether’s MOS is built with a scalable, peer-to-peer IoT architecture that can adapt from small setups using Raspberry Pi boards to large mining sites managing hundreds of thousands of machines. It already supports a wide array of mining hardware vendors, air-cooled and immersion containers, and electrical components such as thermostats. By open-sourcing the platform, Tether aims to reduce barriers to entry for new and smaller mining firms . Ardoino said this could help decentralize the Bitcoin ( BTC ) network by enabling more participants to contribute to mining, thereby enhancing security and reducing the concentration of power held by publicly listed mining giants. “New Bitcoin mining companies will be able to enter the game and compete to keep the network safe,” Ardoino said on X. “MOS will create an even playing field.” You might also like: Strategy adds 1,045 Bitcoin worth $110m, bringing total to 582,000 BTC Custom plugins A key feature of the open-source MOS is its modular plugin system. Developers will be able to create and share custom plugins tailored to specific hardware or site needs, fostering a collaborative development environment. Tether also envisions integrating MOS with its internal data platform QVAC and artificial intelligence tools for performance optimization based on mining data. The open-sourcing could prove especially impactful for small-to-mid-sized enterprises producing their own energy, such as solar or hydro-powered businesses, who may now find it easier to participate in Bitcoin mining using surplus electricity. Tether is preparing the MOS release for Q4 2025, including documentation and user guides.

As of 6/8/2025, we hodl 582,000 $BTC acquired for ~$40.79 billion at ~$70,086 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF $STRD https://t.co/9cpK5vtVwW — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 9, 2025 Strategy’s Bitcoin Trove Now Valued at Over $40B With this latest buy, Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings have reached about 582,000 BTC. The company has spent approximately $40.79 billion to amass its crypto treasury, with an average purchase price of around $70,086 per Bitcoin. As BTC trades near its record highs, Strategy’s holdings are not only historic in size but potentially highly profitable—especially given the company’s early and consistent buying behavior through various market cycles. The firm’s commitment to Bitcoin, initially spearheaded by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, has transformed it into the largest corporate holder of the digital asset. Strategy’s BTC approach has become a core part of its identity, drawing both institutional interest and market scrutiny. Institutional Confidence Grows as Crypto Matures This recent acquisition suggests more than just bullish sentiment—it reflects a broader institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Strategy’s ongoing accumulation suggests it views BTC as a strategic treasury asset, comparable to digital gold. By continuing its at-the-market offering programs and funneling proceeds into Bitcoin, the company is effectively doubling down on its bet that Bitcoin will continue to appreciate and outperform traditional assets over time. As the crypto market matures and regulatory clarity slowly improves, Strategy’s moves may inspire other firms to adopt similar treasury allocation models. Saylor’s Cryptic ‘Send More Orange’ Message On Sunday, Saylor posted a chart of the company’s BTC holdings, saying that Strategy plans to increase its Bitcoin purchases. “Send more Orange,” his message read, as Orange is widely recognized as a symbol for Bitcoin among the crypto community. Saylor has a history of posting on Sundays before his Bitcoin purchases. However, a recent report from K33 Research revealed that Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, appears to have slowed down its Bitcoin buys. K33 Head of Research Vetle Lunde attributed this to a declining premium for MSTR shares relative to the company’s Bitcoin holdings.

2025-06-09T14:40:02,"Bitcoin Price: 5 Crucial Factors Shaping the Market This Week","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price: 5 Crucial Factors Shaping the Market This Week Are you watching the Bitcoin price ? The cryptocurrency market is always dynamic, and staying informed about the key drivers can make a significant difference in understanding potential price movements. This week, several critical factors are on the radar, according to analysis highlighted by Cointelegraph. Let’s dive into the details that could influence the trajectory of BTC price . Watching Key Bitcoin Price Levels One of the most fundamental aspects of Bitcoin analysis involves monitoring key support and resistance levels. This week, the focus is sharply on two specific price points: Support at $100,000: Can Bitcoin hold this significant psychological and technical level? Maintaining support here is crucial for preventing further downside momentum. Resistance at $106,600: Breaking through this resistance level is seen as a necessary step for bulls to regain control and potentially push the price higher. A successful breach could signal a shift in short-term sentiment. These levels act like battlegrounds between buyers and sellers. A failure to hold support or break resistance can often dictate the market’s direction in the short term. Understanding BTC Price Liquidations Liquidation levels represent price points where leveraged trading positions are automatically closed out. Large clusters of liquidations can act as magnets for price, as cascading closures can accelerate moves up or down. Cointelegraph’s analysis points to key areas this week: Concentrated long liquidations near $100,000: This reinforces the importance of the $100k support. If this level is breached, a cascade of long liquidations could amplify the downward move. Short liquidations around $112,000: On the upside, a move towards $112k could trigger short liquidations, potentially fueling a rapid upward spike as short sellers are forced to buy back their positions. Monitoring these liquidation maps provides insight into where significant volatility might occur if these price levels are tested. How US CPI Data Impacts the Crypto Market Macroeconomic data, particularly related to inflation, has a significant impact on the broader financial markets, including the crypto market . This week, two crucial U.S. inflation indicators are scheduled for release: May Consumer Price Index (CPI): This is a key measure of inflation from the consumer’s perspective. May Producer Price Index (PPI): This tracks inflation at the wholesale level. Why is this important for Bitcoin price ? Bitcoin is often discussed as an inflation hedge. High inflation numbers can sometimes boost this narrative, potentially increasing demand. Conversely, cooling inflation might reduce the urgency for such hedges. More importantly, inflation data heavily influences the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions regarding interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect liquidity and investor appetite for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Is the Short-Term Holder Cost Basis a Key Bitcoin Analysis Point? On-chain metrics provide unique insights into market behavior. One such metric is the short-term holder cost basis, which represents the average price at which Bitcoin was acquired by entities holding BTC for less than 155 days. This week, the level to watch is $106,200. Reclaiming the short-term holder cost basis is often considered a bullish signal. It suggests that recent buyers, who are typically more sensitive to price fluctuations, are, on average, no longer underwater. This can reduce selling pressure from this cohort and potentially pave the way for further price appreciation. External Factors Influencing the Crypto Market Beyond technical levels and economic data, external developments can sometimes inject volatility or noise into the crypto market . While the direct impact can be hard to predict, market sentiment can be swayed by prominent figures or geopolitical events. Cointelegraph specifically mentioned potential market impact from external developments, including tensions between U.S. President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. While the direct link to BTC price might seem tenuous, comments or actions from influential figures, especially those with a history of impacting crypto sentiment (like Musk), can sometimes trigger reactions in the market, particularly in a news cycle-driven environment. Bringing It All Together: Actionable Insights So, what does this all mean for you as a market observer or participant? This week requires vigilance across multiple fronts: Watch the $100k support and $106.6k resistance levels closely for technical breakouts or breakdowns. Be aware of the liquidation zones and how price action near them could trigger accelerated moves. Pay close attention to the U.S. CPI and PPI releases and understand how they might influence broader market sentiment and expectations for monetary policy. Monitor if Bitcoin reclaims the short-term holder cost basis around $106,200, as this could signal improving market structure. Stay generally aware of major external news events, recognizing they can sometimes add unpredictable volatility. Navigating the crypto market successfully often involves considering a confluence of factors, not just one. This week’s watch points highlight the interplay between technical indicators, on-chain data, macroeconomic forces, and even external news. Conclusion: Stay Informed, Stay Ahead The coming week presents a complex picture for the Bitcoin price , influenced by critical technical levels, significant liquidation clusters, key economic data releases like CPI data , important on-chain metrics, and potential external noise. By keeping an eye on these five crucial factors, market participants can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the forces currently shaping the crypto market and be better prepared for potential price swings.

2025-06-09T14:39:41,"IXS crypto surges on user spike, but pullback could follow","IX Swap token price surged for four consecutive days, reaching its highest level since March 4. IX Swap ( IXS ) climbed to a high of $0.2692, marking a 155% increase from its April low. The rally coincided with a sharp rise in on-chain activity, as the number of active addresses jumped to 300, the highest since February. This spike in engagement likely reflects increased retail participation driven by fear of missing out. A good example of this is that its social dominance soared to 0.024%, the highest point since June last year. Also, the network growth soared to 176, up from last week’s low of 12. IXS token on-chain metrics | Source: Santiment There was no specific news catalyst behind the IXS surge. As such, the move may be part of a pump-and-dump pattern, which is common among low-cap, thinly traded tokens. IXS currently has a market capitalization of $42 million, with most of its trading volume concentrated on Uniswap ( UNI ). The token is not listed on major tier-1 exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, or Upbit. You might also like: Shiba Inu price plot thickens as whales dump continues Another potential factor behind the move could be anticipation of a major announcement, such as a new partnership or exchange listing. It’s common for crypto tokens to rally in advance of such news. Fundamentally, the IXS ecosystem remains relatively weak, with total value locked (TVL) in the network at just $449,844. IXS’s platform allows Bitcoin ( BTC ) holders to monetize idle assets by earning yields between 4% and 10% without selling. Users pledge BTC as collateral, receive USDT, and deploy it into regulated, fixed-income real-world assets. IXS crypto price technical analysis IXS price chart | Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that IXS bottomed at $0.1370 last week before rallying to $0.2676 on Monday, its highest point since March. The token briefly traded above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages, as well as the Ichimoku cloud indicator. Given this sharp move, a near-term pullback appears likely as traders begin to take profits. If this occurs, price could fall toward the lower boundary of the channel near $0.1398. Conversely, a breakout above the channel’s upper bound at $0.2676 would open the door for further gains, with the next resistance sitting at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.3980.

2025-06-09T14:32:34,"Why Gleec Transitioned From Secure Communications To Payments & Tokenized Art","The post Why Gleec Transitioned From Secure Communications To Payments & Tokenized Art appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News For most blockchain developers these days, the focus of their efforts is no longer just about digital assets. Rather, it’s about building an ecosystem around those assets as a way of making them more “useful” for the people who own them. With an expansive blockchain ecosystem, cryptocurrencies gain more purpose and utility, and that will often translate to increased demand. And if a digital asset is in high demand, there’s every chance its value will increase, much to the delight of anyone who owns it. In the context of blockchain ecosystems, cryptocurrencies become a kind of “digital oil” that greases the wheels, allowing people to access the various products and services that are built on that network. For instance, the most famous blockchain ecosystem is Ethereum, and to use a decentralized application built on that network you’ll need to hold some ETH, as that’s the primary token used to pay the “gas fees” required to transact with any Ethereum-based dApp. This is why the quality of the goods and services within a blockchain ecosystem has a direct impact on the asset’s value. The better those products and services are, the more people want to use them, and that means stacking up on those native assets. Those crypto assets are scarce, and so a broad ecosystem with tons of high-quality services is sure to help drive their price up. In other words, if you’re looking for a good token as an investment, it’s essential to consider the broader ecosystem around that asset and understand what value it actually provides. That means exploring the various protocols and dApps within that ecosystem to see what they have to offer, how unique they are, and whether or not they’re likely to grow. The best developers understand this and focus on building out novel ecosystems that can offer something that other networks don’t, and that has led to an explosion of decentralized networks all doing their own thing. An Evolving Ecosystem Take a look at Gleec , one of the oldest blockchain ecosystems around. It began life in 2015 as a network for secure communications, and that’s still a major focus of the project through Gleec Chat, which provides a secure, blockchain-based platform for encrypted messages. Having embraced blockchain in 2017 and created a native token, GLEEC, that same year, Gleec has since launched numerous initiatives that aim to increase the utility of its native asset. Looking to build up an ecosystem that functioned around its communications platform and the GLEEC token, it first created Gllec Wallet. This later morphed to become the Gleec BTC Exchange, which makes the asset accessible to a global audience. It has since added a global payments infrastructure with services such as Gleec Pay, which enables businesses to accept crypto payments, and Gleec Card, which makes it possible for crypto holders to spend their tokens at any store that accepts Visa cards. The company was notably one of the first to seize on the opportunity created by El Salvador’s decision to legalize Bitcoin, securing a license to convert Bitcoin payments into U.S. dollars at any store via the Gleec BTC Exchange. Gleec also dabbled in play-to-earn games with Gleec Racing, a blockchain-based game that was created in collaboration with the Buggyra racing team. It was a comprehensive, adrenaline-fueled racing simulator where players could deposit GLEEC to compete in weekly Grand Prix races, with the winners taking home a significant prize pot paid out in GLEEC. Diversity is a key theme for Gleec, and its latest initiative has seen it venture into the world of tokenized art with Raphael Coin , or the RAPH token. It’s a novel digital asset that represents a share of the recently rediscovered Rafaello masterpiece “Recto: Study for the Battle of the Milvian Bridge”. By purchasing RAPH tokens with GLEEC, users can become fractional owners of the authenticated artwork through Gleec’s transparent blockchain infrastructure, helping to preserve a cultural masterpiece for future generations. Enhancing Utility & Value Gleec’s strategy of exploring different use cases and applications makes a lot of sense, and has had a dramatic effect on the platform’s adoption. Previously, with its laser-focus on building a secure communications platform, it could only attract a very limited audience – and it was also competing in a very tough industry, with heavyweights like WhatsApp also offering encryption. By expanding its horizons, it appeals to far more than just techno-geeks interested in encrypting their communications, with art enthusiasts becoming its newest target demographic. And now it’s taking that even further, once again reaching out to racing enthusiasts with its sponsorship of the Emirati rally car driver Aliyyah Koloc . Such initiatives showcase the flexibility of Gleec’s regulated blockchain infrastructure and allow it to attract a much wider audience. With its growing ecosystem, Gleec offers a wide range of very useful services, enabling people to actually spend their crypto, use it to play games and invest. Such a strategy has also increased the visibility of Gleec, helping it to target new markets like El Salvador and grow its user base. Having a broad blockchain ecosystem fosters more innovation, with insights from one area being applied to other projects building on the same infrastructure. It also ensures more efficient utilization of blockchain resources, supporting multiple applications and services. Meanwhile, Gleec’s regulatory-compliant infrastructure becomes more adaptable and versatile, making it easier to embrace new use cases for blockchain technology as they arise. As Gleec’s ecosystem expands, it creates positive network effects that benefit every participant, with increased transaction volume for the GLEEC token meaning more liquidity and enhanced value for token holders. By evolving from secure communications into a comprehensive payments infrastructure and an experimental platform for art tokenization, Gleec has transformed GLEEC’s utility and created greater value for token holders. It culminates in more positive network effects that benefit every participant, creating much brighter prospects for the blockchain’s future.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/why-gleec-transitioned-from-secure-communications-to-payments-tokenized-art/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|TRADING","Information",cryptocompare

In a post on the social media platform X, Ardoino responds to Artemis CEO Jon Ma, who estimates that Tether as a company is valued at around $515 billion. According to Ma, Tether would be the 19th-largest company in the world if it went public today, making it bigger than Costco and Coca-Cola. Says Ardoino, “Tether valuation at $515 billion is a beautiful number. Maybe a bit bearish considering our current (and increasing) Bitcoin + Gold treasury, yet I’m very humbled. Also truly excited for the next phase of growth of our company.” But the CEO says that Tether has “no need to go public” – even in the wake of the overwhelming success of the initial public offering (IPO) of Circle, the second-largest stablecoin issuer. Last week, the firm behind USDC launched as a publicly-traded company, debuting on the New York Stock Exchange with an opening price of $69 per share, up by 122% from the IPO price of $31.00 per share. CRCL continued to rally to above $123, nearly a 300% gain from the IPO price in just two trading days.

2025-06-09T14:30:15,"Bitcoin Weekly Chart Flexes Strength—Is The Moonshot Just Getting Started?","Bitcoin is making waves once again, flashing strength on the weekly chart as it closes well above key moving averages. With momentum indicators still favoring the bulls and no signs of exhaustion in sight, the current setup hints that the rally might be far from over. Could this be the beginning of an even bigger breakout? Bitcoin Stays Elevated: Bulls Show No Signs of Fatigue In a recent update shared on X, Shaco AI highlighted Bitcoin’s continued bullish momentum, pointing to strong weekly performance on the BTC/USDT chart. The analyst noted that BTC has “ballooned past recent expectations,” closing the week at an impressive $105,700. Related Reading: Bitcoin At A Crossroads: $97,000 Cost Basis Holds Key To Next Breakout This places the asset well above its 25-week Simple Moving Average (SMA) of $95,009.55 and the 50-week SMA at $83,318.12, an encouraging technical signal that suggests Bitcoin’s uptrend remains firmly intact. As Shaco AI put it, “The party isn’t over yet,” hinting that bullish sentiment could carry BTC even higher. Technical indicators further support this upbeat outlook. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently reads 63.51, indicating that buying momentum remains robust without entering overbought territory. This suggests that traders are still comfortable accumulating at current levels, and the market hasn’t yet reached a point of exhaustion. Furthermore, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) remains firmly in positive territory at 5835.33. The MACD’s positioning reflects steady buyer interest and a favorable trend structure, both of which are crucial for sustaining an upward move. Volume Slackens While Price Nears Critical Resistance Zone The analyst went on to point out that despite the bullish setup currently seen on Bitcoin’s chart, the enthusiasm might be tempered by softening trading volume. Specifically, trading volume has only reached 95,302, significantly lower than the average volume of 179,421. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Slips Again, Triggering Fresh Fears of a Deeper Correction This discrepancy signals a noticeable dip in market participation, raising the question of whether the ongoing price rally has enough fuel to sustain its momentum in the short term. As the analyst emphasized, this drop in volume is worth watching closely since it may influence the momentum of next week’s price action. Looking at the broader picture, Bitcoin is approaching a major resistance level at $111,980. This key barrier represents a potential turning point; either it gets broken and paves the way for further upside, or it holds and prompts a short-term correction. Should a pullback occur, the analyst noted that BTC appears to have a comfortable support zone at $49,000, which could act as a solid cushion. In any case, the analyst suggests keeping a close eye on how these technical levels play out, as they could dictate Bitcoin’s next big move.

2025-06-09T14:30:02,"Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Strengthen Their Grip As Realized Cap Climbs To Uncharted Territory","With bullish sentiment returning to the market again, Bitcoin’s price is witnessing fresh renewed upside movements, allowing the digital asset to revisit the $106,000 mark. As BTC regains upward traction, long-term BTC holders are seeing notable gains as seen in their realized capitalization. Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Realized Cap Surges After recovering from a recent pullback to the $100,000 threshold , Bitcoin has started to exhibit notable bullish movements. During this sideways performance and rebound, BTC’s most patient investors or long-term holders were observed flexing their resilience. In an X post , Kyle Doops, the host of the Crypto Banter Show and market expert, has outlined a positive trend among Bitcoin long-term holders, also regarded as seasoned investors. Kyle Doops highlighted that “smart money isn’t just sitting around right now,” as evidenced by a rise in long-term holder realized cap . Following his examination of the BTC STH LTH Net Position Realized Cap, the expert stated that the Realized Cap for long-term holders has risen to record levels. Specifically, the realized cap for long-term BTC holders is determined by the total value of coins acquired at the price at which they were last moved . The uptick shows that these investors are starting to lock in some serious gains in the midst of BTC’s renewed upward trend. Presently, long-term BTC holders ‘ realized cap has surpassed $37 billion, marking levels not seen since the middle of 2023. Kyle Doops considers such a development a robust conviction from seasoned investors and not a panic. Even with the market’s recent volatility, this sharp increase suggests that experienced investors remain reluctant to sell their Bitcoin. Since bullish activities from key investors often fueled price increases, the next stage of BTC’s rally may be greatly influenced by these long-term holders’ steadfast commitment as they double down on the flagship asset. Overall BTC Realized Cap At A New All-Time High Long-term BTC holders’ increase in realized cap appears to be part of a larger growth in the overall Bitcoin Realized Capitalization. Carmelo Aleman, an on-chain expert, reported in a Quick-Take post on the CryptoQuant data analytics platform that the overall BTC realized cap has grown sharply in the last few days. Despite the heightened volatility in the market, the total realized cap continues to break records. Data shows that the key metric rose to a whopping $934.88 billion as of Sunday, marking its highest level in history. According to Aleman, this dramatic surge confirms consistent BTC buying pressure and increasing capital inflow, which strengthens long-term confidence in the digital assets among investors. Should the metric continue to rise, Bitcoin might muster enough momentum for a push toward its current all-time high and possibly beyond.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-lths-realized-cap-climbs/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Realized Cap|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Realized Cap|btc|BTC news|btc price|BTC STH LTH Net Position Realized Cap|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Carmelo Aleman|Crypto Banter Show|CryptoQuant|Kyle Doops",cryptocompare

2025-06-09T14:22:51,"The End of Bitcoin Maximalism","The launch of Bitcoin in 2009 created a resilient and decentralized monetary asset. Early adherents rallied around it as a singular innovation — immutable, fixed-supply, and leaderless. Over time, this coalesced into a belief system: Bitcoin maximalism. The argument was simple. Bitcoin came first. It had the most Proof-of-Work security. The most conservative monetary policy. All other assets were distractions or regressions. But that framing increasingly diverges from how Bitcoin is now being applied in practice. Interoperability Becomes the New Norm Today, the crypto ecosystem is no longer a collection of isolated silos or, at least, it needn’t be. Interoperability is the backbone of Web3. The same technologies that maximalists once dismissed, like wrapped bitcoin and cross-chain bridges, are now exposing the limitations of that worldview. While these technologies are far from perfect, they prove that users want more than ideological purity; they want utility and functionality. This evolution is particularly significant for Bitcoin, which has historically been limited by its transaction speeds and a lack of smart contract functionality. The watershed moment came with the emergence and explosive growth of DeFi, offering yield farming, lending, and trading opportunities that Bitcoin — at least in its native form — couldn’t directly participate in (most early DeFi activity was concentrated on Ethereum). To bridge this gap, solutions like wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) were conceived and launched, tokenizing BTC for use on Ethereum and other chains. While this was a step forward, wrapped tokens came with associated risks, such as centralized custodians, potential security vulnerabilities and an overall departure from Bitcoin’s trustless ethos. New systems, including trust-minimized tunneling and Bitcoin-anchored consensus proofs, are enabling BTC to be integrated into smart contract environments without compromising its core properties. These architectures avoid the need for wrapping. Instead, they treat Bitcoin as a foundational, external settlement layer that can interact directly with the rest of the blockchain ecosystem — through tunneling and specialized Bitcoin-aware virtual machines. The result is simple: Bitcoin is no longer isolated. And it no longer needs to be. Maximalism vs. Infrastructure Bitcoin maximalism asserts that BTC alone is sufficient. But the infrastructure now being deployed across the ecosystem proves otherwise. BTC is being used in DeFi. BTC is supporting NFT standards. BTC is moving across chains. And it is doing so without compromising its consensus layer or monetary properties. The future of crypto belongs to collaboration, not isolation. Blockchain infrastructure will be shaped by interoperability and modular design. Bitcoin need not compete for dominance in such an ecosystem; rather, it can complement and secure a broader multi-chain ecosystem. As developers build bridges between chains rather than walls, they prove that Bitcoin can coexist with other networks, enhancing its utility instead of competing for dominance. In this environment, the maximalist mentality of “one coin to rule them all” already feels out of touch. Regular crypto users want flexibility and different options to stake, lend, or trade their assets across multiple platforms, which interoperability enables — unlike Bitcoin maximalism that restricts all out-of-the-box use cases. As multi-chain ecosystems mature, users are increasingly drawn to infrastructure that supports cross-chain utility, including secure integrations of BTC. Finally, Bitcoin maximalism has always been rooted mostly in ideology — but the crypto industry is driven by innovation, and new technologies are proving that BTC can evolve without losing its importance or advantages. This way, maximalists risk being left behind if they dismiss these advancements as mere “distractions.” The Core of A Multi-Chain Stack Bitcoin continues to serve as the most secure and censorship-resistant settlement network in the world. That is not changing. What is changing is the environment around it. Decentralized systems are growing more interoperable. The expectation that networks will remain isolated is no longer viable. BTC is becoming a core layer in a multi-chain stack, and more integrated into systems it once stood apart from. Where once Bitcoin maximalism offered clarity during crypto’s early phases of growth, the ecosystem has evolved. Today, Bitcoin can serve as a cornerstone in a broader system emphasizing security, interconnectivity, and composability. As this trend continues to gain momentum, Bitcoin maximalism may fade because the idea that one coin must dominate all others ignores the power of collaboration and innovation. Interoperability isn’t a threat to Bitcoin — it’s a catalyst for growth. The future of crypto isn’t about choosing a single winner but rather about building a decentralized world where every chain, including Bitcoin, plays a vital role. The decentralized future will rely on systems that are secure, interoperable, and modular. Bitcoin’s role as a resilient base layer ensures that it will persist as an integral component of that future, not as the only chain, but a fundamental cornerstone among others.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/06/09/the-end-of-bitcoin-maximalism,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|TRADING","Opinion|Opinion",cryptocompare
