The numbers reflect routine market adjustments but offer a pulse on investor sentiment heading into mid-2025. BTC Down, ETH Up, USDT Slightly Lower According to the report , Binance users now collectively hold 593,000 BTC, representing a 1.82% drop from May 1. In contrast, Ethereum holdings have risen by 1.05% to 5.337 million ETH, signaling slight investor confidence in ETH despite recent market turbulence. USDT balances saw a mild dip of 0.77%, now totaling 28.83 billion, marking a decline of $223 million over the past month. These figures come amid market fluctuations and ongoing demand for transparency from major exchanges. Binance remains the second-largest crypto reserve holder globally, with approximately $110 billion across BTC, ETH, USDT, and USDC. Coinbase still leads the pack with $129 billion under custody, as noted in earlier reports. BNB Dips Below $650 Post-Report Following the update, Binance’s native token BNB slipped below $650, currently trading at $649.89, despite posting a modest 0.15% gain over 24 hours. The price dip suggests investors are digesting the report with caution, even though Binance continues to show strong reserve backing. PoR Continues to Anchor Trust This update is part of Binance’s ongoing push to reinforce transparency and user confidence after a turbulent period for the industry.

2025-06-09T05:46:46,"Cryptocurrency Presale of the Year: Bitcoin Solaris Offers Early Investors 233% Returns Before Becoming the Next Bitcoin","The post Cryptocurrency Presale of the Year: Bitcoin Solaris Offers Early Investors 233% Returns Before Becoming the Next Bitcoin appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Every few years, crypto history repeats itself. A low-priced token appears out of nowhere, gathers a loyal following, and then explodes, creating millionaires in the process. It happened with Bitcoin. It happened with Ethereum. And now, many believe it’s happening again, with a newcomer that might just be the smartest blockchain upgrade we’ve seen: Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S). While the price is still in presale, early investors are already calculating a jaw-dropping 233% return before the token even hits exchanges. Can Bitcoin’s Original Vision Still Compete? Bitcoin is a legend—and rightly so. It introduced the world to decentralized money and a fixed-supply model that revolutionized finance. But despite its strength as digital gold, Bitcoin’s limitations are clear: slow transaction speeds, minimal scalability, and no built-in support for smart contracts. In contrast, Bitcoin Solaris takes that core legacy and injects it with 2025-grade innovation, delivering not just security and scarcity but speed, programmability, and broad usability. The Powerhouse Behind Bitcoin Solaris’s Rise At its heart, Bitcoin Solaris is built for one thing: evolution. It doesn’t aim to replace Bitcoin—it aims to finish what it started. The network uses a dual-layer architecture to solve the trilemma of decentralization, scalability, and speed. The Base Layer runs on SHA-256, the same algorithm that powers Bitcoin, and supports standard mining hardware with a 5-minute block time. Above it, the Solaris Layer operates using Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)—featuring 21 rotating validators, dynamic 32MB blocks, and 15-second confirmations. Together, these layers achieve over 10,000 TPS while staying energy-efficient and secure. And that’s not all. Validator elections, slashing mechanisms, and synchronization between layers ensure stability and fairness across the board. While traditional chains struggle with either speed or security, Bitcoin Solaris bridges both with technical mastery. The Future of Decentralization Is Already Mining—Start with BTC-S Why the Presale Is Gaining Serious Momentum With less than 8 weeks left before its official launch, the Bitcoin Solaris presale is turning heads fast: Current Price: $6 Next Phase: $7 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 10% Over 11,000 users have already joined the presale, and more than $3 million has been raised. This makes it one of the shortest and most explosive presales in recent memory. Investors are chasing a projected 1,900% return, and today marks the final day of Phase 6. The clock is ticking. In a recent in-depth review, Ben Crypto highlighted why so many crypto enthusiasts are calling this the presale of the year, diving into both the scalability and security features that set BTC-S apart. Smart Contracts That Actually Do Something While many chains talk about smart contracts , Bitcoin Solaris builds them for the real world. Rust-based contracts bring enterprise-grade flexibility to the network. DeFi lending, borrowing, tokenized real estate, play-to-earn economies, supply chain tracking—BTC-S supports them all from day one. Here’s what makes it truly special: Rust-based contracts, deployed using Solana’s toolset for seamless developer adoption Cross-chain bridges to connect with Ethereum, Solana, and others Near-instant finality with 2-second confirmation speeds Application support spanning DeFi, gaming, IoT, healthcare, education, and digital identity. The Hidden Wealth Engine Here’s where Bitcoin Solaris really earns its title as the next Bitcoin: mining. But not as you know it. Two-thirds of BTC-S (66.67%) is allocated to mining rewards over time. Mining requires users to hold BTC-S, reducing sell pressure and strengthening long-term value Accessible via desktop, browser, and through the upcoming Solaris Nova app, which is designed for everyday users Unlike traditional systems where whales and server farms dominate, BTC-S distributes opportunity through design. Even holding tokens can power the network and generate returns. It’s a wealth system engineered for mass participation, not just the elite. Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Solaris: What’s Actually Different? Feature Bitcoin Bitcoin Solaris Transaction Speed ~7 TPS 10,000+ TPS Smart Contracts None Full Rust-based support Energy Consumption High 99.95% Lower Validator Governance None On-chain, DPoS validator system Mining Method PoW only PoW + DPoS hybrid Mobile Accessibility None Mining via browser + app Use Case Focus Digital gold Full ecosystem (DeFi, NFTs, etc.) How Bitcoin Solaris Could Make You Rich Bitcoin Solaris isn’t promising overnight riches. It’s offering architecture that rewards smart participation. It’s built with value-holders in mind, not just hype-chasers. With a fixed 21M cap, long-term staking and mining incentives, and a scarcity design straight from Bitcoin’s playbook, it’s not hard to see how early holders could win big. As adoption increases and the ecosystem grows, the upward pressure on BTC-S will come not from marketing—but from function. From holding, using, and participating.

On Sunday, he posted a chart of the company’s BTC holdings, touting that Strategy aims to increase its Bitcoin purchases. “Send more Orange,” his message read, as Orange is widely recognized as a symbol for Bitcoin among the crypto community. Send more Orange pic.twitter.com/QaLJWkLrVN — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 8, 2025 This marks the firm’s ninth week in a row of buying Bitcoin, if the post follows a potential acquisition. The corporation bought 705 BTC for almost $75 million between May 26 and June 1. The firm currently holds 580,955 BTC, worth approximately $61.4 billion at current values, according to Bitcoin Treasuries data . Michael Saylor has a history of posting on Sundays before his Bitcoin purchases. However, a recent report from K33 Research revealed that Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, appears to have slowed down its Bitcoin buys. This is due to a declining premium for MSTR shares relative to the company’s Bitcoin holdings, K33 Head of Research Vetle Lunde attributed. ’Strategy Is Fully Torqued Bitcoin’: Michael Saylor On June 7, Saylor posted a victorious message on X, sharing an infographic on how Bitcoin has helped Strategy outperform other major tech titans, including Tesla, Meta and Nvidia. “Strategy is fully torqued Bitcoin,” he wrote on X, with a 126% increase in terms of a year return growth. Strategy is fully torqued Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/Dqu6RKY7b7 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 6, 2025 The posts follow Strategy’s announcement of a $1 billion stock offering , and using the proceeds to fund additional Bitcoin purchases and general corporate expenses. Per the announcement, the company aims to issue 11,764,700 shares of 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock, at a public offering price of $85.00 per share. “Strategy intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin and for working capital,” the announcement read. Bitcoin Treasury Race Heats Up: What Could Be Next? Following Strategy’s lead, there has been an intensifying competition among corporations entering the Bitcoin treasury space. Japan’s Metaplanet, for instance, has been stochpiling Bitcoin continuously, with a new target to accumulate 210,000 BTC by 2027 . The Tokyo-listed investment firm currently holds 8,888 BTC, placing it tenth globally in corporate Bitcoin holdings. Michael Saylor’s Sunday endorsement could signal sustained positive sentiment among traders and potentially increase institutional accumulation. Though, monitoring Saylor’s social activity could be relevant for short-term trading strategies, as institutional sentiment could lead to price volatility.

2025-06-09T05:30:06,"Bitcoin Volatility Ahead? 3 Things That Could Move Crypto Markets This Week","Last week’s weak PMI reports showed manufacturing activity contracting for a third month in a row and services activity shrinking for the first time in 11 months. Additionally, crypto markets have settled a little following the volatility in the wake of the spat between US President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk late last week. However, some of that may return this week when key inflation and consumer sentiment reports are released. On top of this, the next round of US-China trade talks is scheduled to begin on Monday, commented the Kobeissi Letter. Economic Events June 9 to 13 The most impactful report of the week is May’s Consumer Price Index CPI which is one of the two key measures of inflation. Central bank policymakers and investors closely monitor the CPI report as it reflects price trends across the economy and shapes sentiment. The May CPI report is likely to confirm that price pressures remain elevated, according to analysts. May’s Producer Price Index (PPI) report will follow the CPI on Thursday, reflecting input costs for producers and manufacturers. PPI measures the cost of producing consumer goods, which ultimately impacts retail prices, and is viewed as a leading indicator of inflationary pressures. June’s Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index and Consumer Inflation Expectations preliminary readings are due on Friday. These reports summarize consumer confidence and long-term inflation expectations, which can impact spending and overall economic growth. Key Events This Week: 1. Atlanta Fed GDPNow data – Monday 2.

Michigan Consumer Sentiment data – Friday This marks… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) June 8, 2025 This marks the last week of inflation data before the June Fed meeting. According to the CME Fed Watch tool, there is a 99.9% probability that interest rates will remain unchanged at the June 18 central bank meeting. Crypto Market Outlook Crypto markets have dipped a little over the past 24 hours, with a 2% decline in total capitalization, which dropped to $3.41 trillion during Monday morning trading in Asia. Overall, markets remain range-bound bound having recovered from their Friday fall and holding steady over the weekend. Bitcoin topped $106,000 during late trading on Sunday but declined a little to $105,600 on Monday, June 9. Aside from Friday’s dip, it has remained within this tight trading channel since the end of May. Ethereum is holding steady around the $2,500 price zone, failing to break resistance above $2,700 but also not slumping back towards $2,000. Most of the altcoins are generally flat with minor gains for XRP and ICP, and further losses for memecoins.

2025-06-09T05:00:00,"Coinbase Reduces Account Freezes and Launches DeFi Access for XRP and DOGE","Coinbase is making meaningful changes to improve both user experience and product offerings. The crypto exchange announced the launch of wrapped XRP and Dogecoin on its Layer-2 Base network, giving holders access to decentralized finance (DeFi) opportunities. At the same time, CEO Brian Armstrong reported an 82% reduction in unnecessary account freezes, addressing a long-standing user concern through improved machine learning infrastructure. Coinbase Slashes Account Freezes by 82% Amid Growing User Pressure and Data Breach Fallout Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong says the company has made major strides in solving one of its most persistent and controversial issues: unnecessary user account freezes. In a June 6 post on X, Armstrong revealed that the crypto exchange has successfully reduced such incidents by 82%, attributing the improvement to recent internal changes and new investments in technology. “For longer than is acceptable, account restrictions have been a major pain point for Coinbase users,” Armstrong admitted. “We’ve now made it a top priority to fix it.” He added that the company is continuing to roll out improvements and encouraged users with frozen accounts to contact Coinbase Support directly. For years, Coinbase users have complained about sudden and prolonged account freezes—often without clear explanations. Many said they were locked out of their funds for months, and in some cases, even years. These restrictions led to widespread user dissatisfaction, with some customers abandoning the platform altogether. One X user, responding to Armstrong’s post, claimed they had been locked out for over two years, while another described enduring an eight-month freeze before giving up on Coinbase entirely. A common theme in these accounts is frustration with Coinbase’s customer service infrastructure. “It is extremely hard to speak to a live customer service person,” one user wrote. “It can take forever to track someone down.” This customer service bottleneck has been compounded by another major blow to user trust: a recent data breach that compromised the personal details of over 70,000 Coinbase accounts. Illicit actors reportedly bribed overseas customer support agents to gain access to sensitive information such as government-issued IDs and home addresses. The breach occurred in December 2024 but was only disclosed in mid-May 2025. Machine Learning and Internal Reforms Coinbase credits much of the improvement in account freeze issues to new machine learning models and infrastructure upgrades spearheaded by Dor Levi, a product team member who joined the company just nine weeks ago. In a separate X post, Levi explained that Coinbase had made “significant investments” to enhance the precision and recall of its fraud detection and compliance models. These efforts have directly resulted in fewer account restrictions and false positives. Despite these advancements, both Armstrong and Levi emphasized that Coinbase will continue to impose account restrictions when legally required—such as in response to court orders or government sanctions—to remain in compliance with international laws. Coinbase is also under intense scrutiny following revelations about a major data leak that exposed customer identities. According to reports, bad actors bribed international contractors to access Coinbase’s support systems, allowing them to download ID photos and sensitive contact information. The fallout from this breach has been severe. One user claimed that a family friend lost both Bitcoin and Ether in a scam they believe was connected to the incident. Armstrong previously addressed the breach in a May 15 X post, promising that Coinbase would be “significantly strengthening” its internal controls and agent access protocols. The Stakes Are High With over 100 million registered users, Coinbase remains one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world. It is also the primary custodian for spot Bitcoin ETFs, making its operational integrity a crucial matter not just for individual users but also for institutional investors. The company’s move to fix account freezes could go a long way toward restoring user trust, but only if followed through with consistent action. For now, the 82% reduction is a promising sign, but the platform’s critics are likely to remain skeptical until the remaining 18% of issues are also addressed and security practices are fully overhauled. Coinbase Brings XRP and Dogecoin to DeFi on Base With New Wrapped Tokens In related news, Coinbase , has also taken a major step toward expanding the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem on its Layer-2 blockchain, Base. The company announced last week that wrapped versions of XRP and Dogecoin—cbXRP and cbDOGE—are now live on the Base network, opening the door for millions of token holders to generate yield through DeFi strategies. This development allows holders of the original XRP and DOGE assets to earn returns from decentralized applications (dApps) without having to leave the Coinbase ecosystem. It’s a powerful blend of accessibility, interoperability, and scalability—three key pillars Coinbase has touted as central to Base’s vision since its launch. A New Frontier for XRP and Dogecoin Wrapped tokens are tokenized representations of cryptocurrencies that exist on networks where they are not natively supported. In this case, cbXRP and cbDOGE are ERC-20 compliant tokens on Base, backed 1:1 by their underlying assets, which Coinbase holds in secure custody. This ensures the wrapped tokens are fully collateralized and redeemable. XRP, best known as the payments token powering Ripple’s cross-border settlement rails, and Dogecoin, the meme-born cryptocurrency that has developed a robust following and ecosystem, both historically lacked deep integration with Ethereum-compatible DeFi ecosystems. Base’s introduction of wrapped versions now changes that. Coinbase said the move allows holders to participate in yield farming, liquidity provision, lending, and other DeFi protocols natively available on Base. Importantly, it means users can retain exposure to XRP and DOGE while layering on additional sources of yield. Within just 24 hours of their launch, cbXRP and cbDOGE saw strong market interest. Data from blockchain explorer BaseScan shows that cbXRP surpassed a $5 million market cap, while cbDOGE is approaching the $2 million mark. These rapid inflows suggest significant demand from token holders eager to unlock new use cases beyond simple holding or trading. The adoption of wrapped tokens for DeFi use is not new—Coinbase previously launched wrapped Bitcoin (cbETH and later cbBTC) on Base in September 2024, which has now grown into a major asset on the chain with a market cap of over $4.7 billion. With the success of cbBTC as a precedent, cbXRP and cbDOGE are expected to follow a similar growth trajectory, especially as Base becomes a more attractive hub for DeFi applications and developer activity. Why Base? Launched by Coinbase in early 2023, Base is a Layer-2 network built on the OP Stack, developed by Optimism. The network was created to offer a scalable, low-cost, and developer-friendly alternative to Ethereum’s mainnet while staying compatible with the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Base has been instrumental in Coinbase’s strategy to bridge centralized finance (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). By bringing wrapped assets onto Base, Coinbase is ensuring that even holders of non-EVM-native assets like XRP and DOGE can participate in Web3 without the traditional pain points of complex bridging or high fees. In doing so, Coinbase is also strengthening Base’s positioning against other Layer-2 contenders such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync. For XRP and Dogecoin communities, the move represents a major step forward in utility expansion. While XRP has long been used in traditional financial infrastructure through RippleNet and its ODL (On-Demand Liquidity) product, its availability in DeFi has been limited. Dogecoin, often dismissed as a meme coin, has steadily carved out a real presence in the market, backed by a passionate user base and integration into tipping systems and merchant payments. Its new wrapped version could reinvigorate interest from developers and DeFi projects looking to capture Dogecoin’s broad user appeal. Both tokens now stand to benefit from liquidity pools, lending markets, staking derivatives, and DEX listings that can dramatically increase their functionality and relevance in the current DeFi landscape. The Bigger Picture Coinbase’s continued expansion into wrapped assets and Base integration is part of a broader strategic pivot toward Web3 infrastructure and passive income services. As traditional trading revenues face pressure from competition and regulation, DeFi and on-chain products represent a growth avenue for the exchange. By offering a seamless pathway for retail and institutional users to explore DeFi with familiar assets like XRP, DOGE, and BTC, Coinbase is reducing the technical and psychological friction that has long slowed DeFi’s adoption.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9486/coinbase-reduces-account-freezes-and-launches-de-fi-access-for-xrp-and-doge,"BTC|DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|XRP","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-09T04:54:32,"Coinbase Cuts Account Lockouts by 82% – Can It Finally Win Back Trader Trust?","Coinbase says it has slashed unnecessary account restrictions by 82%, following widespread criticism over long-standing issues that left users locked out of their accounts for weeks or even months. CEO Brian Armstrong acknowledged the issue in a June 6 post on X, calling account freezes a “major issue” that had persisted “for longer than is acceptable.” He said resolving it has become a priority for the company. “The issue has been reduced by 82% so far, with more improvements coming,” Armstrong said. He also encouraged users still affected to contact Coinbase Support. Coinbase Tries to Rebuild Trust After Long-Standing Account Freeze Issues The improvements come after years of frustration among users, some of whom reported being locked out for extended periods with limited ability to reach support. Many cited abrupt freezes with no clear explanation, while others reported abandoning the platform altogether due to poor service and a lack of recourse. Account freezing has been a major issue at Coinbase for longer than is acceptable. I could list a bunch of the underlying reasons why it got so bad in the first place, but what's more important is that we've made it a priority to fix, and we have been making good progress. Shout… https://t.co/Emrq6KQhpD — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) June 6, 2025 These challenges have contributed to eroding user confidence, compounded recently by a data breach that exposed personal details of over 70,000 customers . Armstrong credited the progress to Dor Levi, a recent hire on the Coinbase product team. Levi, who joined nine weeks ago, said the company had invested heavily in upgrading its machine learning models and internal infrastructure. These changes improved the accuracy of automated systems that flag accounts for potential violations, thereby reducing false positives and unnecessary restrictions. System Fixes Continue but Users Say Customer Service Still Falls Short While the company aims to minimize disruptions, Armstrong and Levi noted that some freezes will continue in cases involving legal obligations, sanctions, or fraud prevention. Still, Levi admitted that Coinbase’s handling of account access “doesn’t meet [his] own bar,” and pledged further refinement. The public response remains mixed. In replies to Armstrong’s post, some users said they remain locked out, with one claiming to have been denied access to their account for over two years. Another said they left the exchange after an eight-month freeze. Others complained about difficulty reaching human support, echoing a long-running complaint about customer service delays. The timing of the update follows scrutiny over Coinbase’s handling of a data breach disclosed in May. According to Reuters, attackers bribed overseas support contractors last December to obtain access to sensitive user information, including government-issued ID and home addresses. Exchange Tries to Reset, But Consistency and Transparency Will Be the Real Test So, can Coinbase win back trader trust? The 82% reduction is a meaningful start. However, trust in crypto is hard-won and easily lost. For many retail users who left after prolonged freezes, one announcement is not enough. They need consistent action to believe the change is real. What matters now is whether Coinbase follows through with consistent improvements, transparent communication, and a more responsive support system. As the largest custodian of spot Bitcoin ETFs and a major US exchange with over 100m users, Coinbase has much at stake. The company’s efforts to resolve user pain points are being closely watched, both by retail traders and also by regulators and institutions evaluating the security and reliability of crypto infrastructure.

While supporters believe that it could boost the economy and push crypto adoption forward, critics are worried about Bitcoin’s volatility. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-09T04:13:58,"MEXC Unveils New Launchpad Featuring BTC to Kick Off BTC Trading Month","BitcoinWorld MEXC Unveils New Launchpad Featuring BTC to Kick Off BTC Trading Month VICTORIA , Seychelles , June 9, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — In a bold move to restore fairness in early-stage token investing, MEXC , a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, has officially launched its new Launchpad. The platform is designed to offer users fair and transparent access to high-quality tokens. By removing barriers to entry and offering discounted subscriptions to premium assets, it gives equal opportunity to all users, regardless of account status, trading volume, or social influence. The first subscription event under this new model will feature Bitcoin (BTC), marking a high-trust starting point and kicking off its BTC Trading Month. While many launchpads promise community access, most have evolved into tiered, opaque systems where venture capitalists, influencers, and VIPs secure favorable allocations — leaving regular users with scraps. MEXC’s new launchpad model challenges this status quo by removing lotteries, VIP tiers, and preferential pools. Instead, it introduces a fully transparent, contribution-based allocation mechanism that puts retail users and large investors on equal footing. “The spirit of launchpads has been lost in recent years,” said Tracy Jin , COO of MEXC. “We’re bringing it back — by making early-stage investing truly community-first again.” Participation in the MEXC Launchpad is open to everyone . Users can directly subscribe to project offerings using USDT or other designated tokens. Allocations are distributed on a purely proportional basis, with simple tasks, point farming, or influencer-driven campaigns involved. There are two primary models available: full subscription, where tokens are allocated directly based on the invested amount, and oversubscription, where allocations are shared proportionally among participants when demand exceeds supply. Building on this structure, participants will also be able to subscribe to tokens at discounted rates below the expected market price, increasing their potential upside. MEXC Launchpad is not limited to early-stage projects; it will also provide access to premium, well-established tokens with strong fundamentals and market appeal. The first subscription event under this new model will feature Bitcoin (BTC), marking a high-trust starting point. The subscription period will run from June 6 to June 20 and includes exclusive offers tailored to different user segments. New users will be able to purchase BTC at a discount of up to 90%, with individual allocations ranging from 5 to 55 USDT, and a total pool capped at 4 BTC. Existing users will receive a 20% discount, with allocation limits set between 25 and 250 USD1 , and a total cap of 3 BTC. To further encourage participation, a referral rewards program offers 5 USDT for each new user referred, up to a maximum of 100 USDT per participant. MEXC Launchpad will focus on selecting high-quality projects, particularly in trending and high-growth sectors such as Real World Assets, AI, and the TON ecosystem. Each project is evaluated in collaboration with MEXC Ventures, which provides further support and funding to help innovative ideas scale. Most significantly, no venture capital or KOL pools exist within MEXC Launchpad. All allocations happen on-chain, using a transparent algorithm based solely on each user’s actual contribution. This removes the structural favoritism that has plagued traditional launchpads. “We believe innovation should be accessible to everyone,” MEXC’s Jin said. “You shouldn’t have to be a whale, influencer, or VC to get early access to good projects. Our goal is to level the playing field and empower all users to access high-quality projects at favorable terms. With the new Launchpad, we’re making it easier for real users to engage with real innovation, without the usual barriers or preferential treatment.” As the crypto market continues to heat up, MEXC Launchpad offers something rare: a chance for everyday users to participate in the next wave of innovation, without being pushed aside by insiders. About MEXC Founded in 2018, MEXC is committed to being “Your Easiest Way to Crypto.” Serving over 40 million users across 170+ countries, MEXC is known for its broad selection of trending tokens, everyday airdrop opportunities, and low trading fees. Our user-friendly platform is designed to support both new traders and experienced investors, offering secure and efficient access to digital assets. MEXC prioritizes simplicity and innovation, making crypto trading more accessible and rewarding.

Michael van de Poppe Says It’s Time to Accumulate appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News With Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency, recently hitting an all-time high of $111,980 and taking over 64.64% of the market, many in the crypto community are starting to wonder: When will the altcoin season finally arrive? Meanwhile, Veteran Crypto expert Michael van de Poppe explained why he thinks the altcoins season is about to start soon. Altcoins Have Been Slow for Years Michael says that altcoins have not been doing well since late 2021. He remembers that the last big altcoin season was in 2017, when almost every altcoin was going up fast. In 2021, older altcoins didn’t do as well as newer tokens. In 2024, most of the hype was about memecoins, not the usual altcoins. He also points out that in the past four years, Bitcoin went as high as $65,000, and during that time, around 95% of altcoin gains were already done. But after that, altcoins kept falling, and many people stopped caring about them. Global Factors Holding Back Altcoins Van de Poppe believes this cycle is different. He says that altcoins are underperforming because we’re still in a “Bitcoin season,” and people are afraid to take risks. When #Altseason ? One of the most asked questions, as people are looking to make a large return, willing to bet everything on it. Altseason hasn't come for a long time, the question is: when will this start to appear? I think we're not too far off, and it's all about… pic.twitter.com/8GtMzDD0Zt — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) June 8, 2025 Meanwhile, Central banks are changing their economic policies, and many fear a recession. And the real progress is happening in DeFi and other parts of the crypto world. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Meme Coin ETFs To Be Launched By 2026, Says Senior Bloomberg Analyst , Gold is even hitting a new all-time high, which might make people feel safer about investing again. Even the Chinese Renminbi is doing better than the Dollar, which often helps Ethereum do better than Bitcoin. Altcoin Season: When Will It Start? Michael shares that people are eagerly waiting for altcoin season, asking, “When will it start?” He says there are two types of people right now, some think the market is still in a bear phase, while others believe the next big rise is just beginning. He feels that now is a good time to pick up altcoins. Many of them are priced low and have strong teams. Michael says this is the chance to buy them quietly, before the rest of the world catches on. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-09T03:51:03,"Bitcoin Struggles as Hang Seng Cheers U.S.-China Trade Talks; U.S. Inflation Eyed","Major cryptocurrencies showed little bullish momentum Monday, even as hopes for the U.S.-China trade talks lifted Asian stocks. Bitcoin BTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, traded flat-to-negative near $105,650, having carved out a doji candle, a sign of indecision, on Sunday, according to data source TradingView. Data from Blockchain.com showed a marked slowdown in network activity, with the seven-day moving average of daily on-chain transactions falling to 315.48K, the lowest in at least a year. Payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP XRP struggled to gather upside traction despite topping a bearish trendline from the mid-May highs. The cryptocurrency changed hands at $2.24 at press time, down over 1% on the day (UTC). Volatility may increase this week as the XRP Ledger's APEX 2025 conference kicks off in Singapore. Meme cryptocurrency dogecoin DOGE traded nearly 2% lower, closing in on 18 cents, having failed to establish a foothold above the 100-day simple moving average (SMA) over the weekend. Hang Seng tops 24K Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 1.3%, topping the 24,000 mark for the first time since March 24, according to data source TradingView. The move came in response to the optimism about the U.S.-China trade talks this week. ""Optimism is as high as it's been since Trump's election as top trade deputies will meet in London starting on Monday. There are indications that talks will go all week and Trump himself is optimistic,"" ForexLive's Chief Currency Analyst Adam Button said in a blog post. ""The meeting should go very well,"" President Donald Trump said on Truth Social Friday, announcing the new round of trade talks in London. Other Asian indices, such as South Korea's KOSPI and China's Shanghai Composite, also gained ground despite the deepening consumer and factory gate deflation in China. China's deflation worsens China's consumer prices fell 0.1% year-over-year in May, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics released on Monday. The CPI first turned negative in February. Meanwhile, the producer price index, or factory gate prices, fell 3.3% year-over-year in May, registering a sharper decline than the 3.2% drop analysts had expected. Factory gate prices have been in deflation since October 2022. According to Robin Brooks, senior fellow in the Global Economy and Development program at the Brookings Institution, the U.S. tariffs are generating a deflationary shock for major exporters like China. ""China's producer price inflation for consumer goods is down to its lowest level since the 2008 crisis. U.S. tariffs will now push China into full-on deflation. All necessary conditions for deflation are there: weak consumption and a debt overhang. U.S. tariffs are now the catalyst...,"" Brooks said on X. The worsening deflation could prompt China to stimulate domestic demand with further liquidity easing. China’s central bank in May cut the key interest rates by 10 basis points to a historic low while reducing the reserve requirement ratio, releasing liquidity into the market. Last week, the state-run China Securities Journal reported that the People's Bank of China may lower the reserve requirement ratio further later this year to support growth and restart government bond trading. More Chinese stimulus could bode well for financial markets, including cryptocurrencies. Focus on U.S. CPI The U.S. consumer price index for May due Wednesday will be scrutinized by markets for clues that Trump's tariffs are adding to price pressures in the economy. The headline CPI is seen matching April's pace of 0.2% month-on-month growth, equating to an annualized 2.5% rise versus April's 2.3% increase, according to FXStreet. Meanwhile, the core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy component, is forecast to have ticked higher to 2.9% in May from 2.8% in April. Economists at Barclays expect the data to show first signs of tariffs-related price increases across wide range of core goods. A hotter-than-expected print could dent Fed rate cuts, potentially injecting downside volatility in financial markets.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/09/bitcoin-struggles-as-hopes-for-u-s-china-trade-talks-lift-hang-seng-to-highest-since-march-china-s-deflation-worsens,"ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Markets|Bitcoin|XRP|DOGE|Markets|market analysis|News",cryptocompare

Saylor posted “Send more Orange” on X on June 8 — a phrase often followed by the company’s Bitcoin acquisition announcements. If the pattern holds, this could mark Strategy’s ninth consecutive week of BTC purchases. The post follows closely after Strategy added 705 BTC between May 26 and June 1, spending around $75 million at an average of $106,495 per coin. That brings the firm’s total holdings to 580,955 BTC, valued at about $61.4 billion. According to SaylorTracker, the company is currently up nearly 50% on its investment, translating to an unrealized profit of roughly $20.6 billion. $1 Billion Stock Offering Fuels Bitcoin Strategy Saylor’s cryptic post coincides with Strategy’s announcement of a massive $1 billion stock offering, a sharp increase from the previously planned $250 million raise. The firm aims to use the capital to fund further Bitcoin acquisitions and for general corporate expenses. The offering involves 11.76 million shares of a new 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock, priced at $85 per share. After deducting underwriting and other fees, Strategy expects net proceeds of approximately $979 million. Unlike its earlier funding rounds, the new stock provides non-cumulative 10% dividends — a move designed to appeal to yield-seeking institutional investors. This funding structure enables the company to continue its Bitcoin strategy while offering more predictable returns to shareholders. Largest Institutional Bitcoin Holder Data from Bitcoin Treasuries shows that Strategy now holds more Bitcoin than any other publicly known entity — including governments like the United States and China. Its holdings are nearly twelve times larger than the next biggest corporate holder, Bitcoin miner Mara Holdings. As a result, many investors increasingly view Strategy not just as a business, but as a vehicle for Bitcoin exposure. With Saylor continuing to tease new purchases, the company shows no signs of slowing down.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/strategy-hints-at-more-bitcoin-buys-after-75m-acquisition/,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare
2025-06-09T01:50:47,"Crypto Market Meltdown: Bitcoin Spikes as Trump-Elon Chaos Hits The Market, Is A Bigger Crash Coming?","With the crypto market in a meltdown, Bitcoin (BTC) is seeing a dramatic spike in volatile price movements ignited by a public feud between US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, even as FloppyPepe (FPPE) emerges as a key focus for investors. The volatility has pulled focus away from traditional assets and cast fresh doubt on Bitcoin’s (BTC) near-term stability, sparking fears of a wider market crash. According to Coinglass , over $967 million in crypto market liquidations have occurred, confirming that bullish traders were caught off guard. The sheer scale of the chaos underscores the crypto market’s volatile nature and its reaction to macro headlines, particularly those stirred by Donald Trump or Elon Musk. Trump vs Musk: The Feud Behind the Bitcoin (BTC) Plunge Donald Trump and Elon Musk have turned the crypto market into their battlefield, igniting a wave of panic selling across Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins. Their explosive exchange sent Bitcoin (BTC) plummeting, shedding nearly 3% and pushing it to retest the crucial $100,000 threshold once more. This political clash has pulled the entire crypto market into chaos. Data shows long liquidations for Bitcoin (BTC) totaled over $345 million, fueling analyst speculation regarding the potential for a bigger crash.

2025-06-09T01:47:16,"XRP Lawyer urges followers to purchase Bitcoin at $106K","John Deaton, a prominent cryptocurrency lawyer and vocal XRP supporter, is sending a powerful signal to investors: Bitcoin is still a buy — even at $106,000. On social media platform X , Deaton recently sought to explain why he thinks today’s lofty prices carry more opportunity than risks. His approach flies in the face of the notion that one should “buy low.” He makes the case, by contrast, that macro conditions and long-term potential count for more than short-term price tags. Deaton disclosed that 80% of his net worth is in BTC, and his average purchase cost is less than $25,000. Nonetheless, he does not think the current six-figure range is too late. Instead, he says they’re “more asymmetrical,” meaning there’s more upside based on what he deems are more potential gains versus potential losses—despite the more expensive price. He said this in response to Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey’s appeal for people to find some money and purchase BTC today. Deaton also echoed Bailey’s call but cautioned that citizens living paycheck-to-paycheck should not risk their homes or take out loans to spend money to invest in crypto. Regardless, he maintains that Bitcoin is one of the best current stores for value. Deaton’s criticisms are rooted in larger concerns about the global economy. He cited growing national debt levels in the US, the re-imposition of Trump-era tariffs, and endless money printing from central banks as major red signs. In his view, these are gradually undermining confidence in fiat currencies. For Deaton, BTC is the answer. It’s decentralized, with only 21 million coins ever to be produced, and it can’t be manipulated by governments or printed into infinity. “Bitcoin is a hedge against the collapse of fiat,” Deaton said in a podcast interview last month. Institutions and countries are jumping in Another element of Deaton’s argument is the wave of institutional and even state adoption of Bitcoin. Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) is leading the charge. The company has been in the news for its aggressive purchase of BTC. The firm now owns more than 200,000 BTC, the equivalent of tens of billions of dollars, and is adding to its holdings each week. In the last seven days alone,16 companies have been added to an expanding list of businesses incorporating Bitcoin into their corporate treasury. But businesses are not the only ones being buoyed. Governments are also starting to take Bitcoin more seriously. Rep.Tim Burchett introduced a bill in Congress to codify Trump’s executive order into a law that created a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Countries such as Pakistan, Ukraine, and Ireland are also eyeing similar proposals and exploring the possibility of utilizing BTC n their reserves or foreign exchange plans. Critics groan as studies take off But not everyone is as sanguine as Deaton, even as the movement gathers steam. Dr. Peter Schiff, economist, gold supporter, and outspoken critic of Bitcoin, argued on Twitter that Bitcoin’s moonshot is nothing more than hype. He thinks it still has no inherent value and is far too erratic to be a true haven. But Deaton isn’t fazed. He acknowledges that he has “confirmation and wealth-preservation bias.” Still, he maintains that Bitcoin is the most secure long-term asset in our current political instability and economic storm world. Deaton tells investors to look past price charts. He says they should instead wonder: Where is the world headed? The solution, according to Deaton, is none other than BTC.

In a new YouTube update, Wood shares a Bitcoin-to-gold chart that she says is still in an uptrend, partially due to BTC’s “anti-fragile” nature in recent years. “This uptrend has not been broken. Again, this aligns with the net bullish risk-on kind of market that we think we’re in, and I guess you could call the markets anti-fragile, which is a description used in Bitcoin. It’s been able to withstand all kinds of turmoil and we think that the markets, the equities markets, are following Bitcoin in this regard.” Source: ARK Invest/YouTube Wood is also optimistic about the crypto industry given regulatory clarity from the Trump administration and what she believes is an incoming reconfiguration of the financial services space. “We think this is a very powerful movement. We think the financial services sector is going to reconfigure completely in the next five to ten years, and that of course Bitcoin and now Circle and of course Coinbase as well. Robinhod, [and] others… SoFi is now moving back into crypto in a big way now that regulatory clarity is here.

2025-06-08T23:39:28,"Asia Morning Briefing: Michael Saylor Downplays BTC's Quantum Threat","Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. BlackRock calls Quantum computers, with their ability to outperform classical binary computers and break traditional encryption, a threat to crypto . So surely bitcoin BTC would price this in, as the threat of computers soon being able to break the encryption that enables the scarcity of bitcoin is an existential one. But on a recent CNBC appearance, Strategy's Michael Saylor downplayed quantum's threat to BTC, arguing that the Bitcoin protocol would implement a software upgrade – just like any other tech company – when the threat becomes imminent. ""It's mainly marketing from people that want to sell you the next quantum yo-yo token,"" Saylor said on CNBC. ""Google and Microsoft aren't going to sell you a computer that cracks modern cryptography because it would destroy Google and Microsoft – and the U.S. Government and the banking system."" Already, there are a number of proposals about how to secure Proof of Work against the quantum threat, including from BTQ , a startup building quantum-proof crypto hardware. One Bitcoin developer has put forward a draft Bitcoin Improvement Protocol that proposes a hard fork which would move everyone's wallets to quantum-secure addresses. ""Bitcoin is a protocol; the software gets upgraded every year,"" Saylor concluded, arguing that the bigger security threat for bitcoin is phishing. Saylor's view isn't a universal one, however. A recent report from Presto Research argued that the crypto industry is ""unprepared"" for the coming quantum threat. With BTC above $100K and the market getting ready to challenge another all-time high, traders just don't seem to be concerned. With Circle's Blockbuster IPO, the True Market Size of Stablecoins Remains a Mystery Circle (CRCL) recently had a blockbuster initial public offering, and is set to open the U.S. trading week Monday at over $107 – an impressive rally over its opening price of $69. The number of stablecoins in circulation – the market cap of the asset category – is a well-known fact. Issuance can be seen on-chain after all, and that number comes in at $254 billion, according to CoinGecko data . But figuring out the volume of stablecoins used in payments is a little trickier. In a recent thread on X , Nic Carter, partner at Castle Island Ventures and the cofounder of blockchain data aggregator Coinmetrics, parsed through the available data and found that there's a huge discrepancy in the numbers. Estimating the genuine share of stablecoin transactions driven by payments rather than trading is complicated due to challenges like MEV bot interference, duplicative on-chain transactions, and spam activity designed purely to inflate metrics. Recent analyses illustrate this uncertainty starkly. A top-down heuristic from Visa and Allium estimates stablecoin transaction volumes at roughly $9 trillion annually as of May 2025. However, this figure broadly encompasses trading, DeFi activity, and settlements—not purely payments. In contrast, more detailed bottom-up analyses offer narrower but clearer insights. Fireblocks, a major custody provider, reported annual verified stablecoin payments of around $232 billion, compared with a significantly larger $2.12 trillion in trading volumes among its clients, suggesting that genuine payment transactions represent about 10% of their total stablecoin activity. Similarly, a targeted joint study by Artemis and Dragonfly sampled 20 stablecoin-focused payment providers directly. It calculated a conservative annualized payment volume of approximately $72.3 billion, acknowledging this as a probable undercount given limited sampling. In comparison to that $72.3 billion figure at the high end, Carter writes, is $232 billion, underscoring the substantial uncertainty around how extensively stablecoins are genuinely used as a payment mechanism. As for Circle, the stablecoin issuer doesn't provide a figure in its IPO filing on how much USDC is used for payments, only pointing to general transaction volume. News Roundup Coinbase, BiT Global Settle Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) Delisting Lawsuit BiT Global and Coinbase have settled their legal dispute over Coinbase's delisting of wrapped bitcoin (wBTC), CoinDesk previously reported . According to a joint court filing, BiT Global agreed to dismiss its lawsuit with prejudice—meaning the case cannot be refiled—and each company will cover its own legal costs. BiT Global initially sued Coinbase last year, claiming the delisting unfairly damaged wBTC's liquidity and reputation, while favoring Coinbase’s competing token, cbBTC. Coinbase cited concerns over crypto billionaire Justin Sun’s involvement with wBTC, labeling it an ""unacceptable risk,"" though specific settlement terms beyond the dismissal were not disclosed. Winklevoss Twins' Crypto Exchange Gemini files for Confidentially IPO Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange and custody platform founded by billionaires Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has confidentially filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to go public, CoinDesk previously reported . The IPO details, including the size and valuation, remain undisclosed, but Gemini has already engaged Goldman Sachs and Citigroup as financial advisors, positioning itself prominently among crypto-native firms entering traditional markets. This filing follows the successful IPO of stablecoin issuer Circle, whose shares surged dramatically upon debuting on the New York Stock Exchange. Gemini's planned IPO represents a significant step for crypto companies seeking broader acceptance in mainstream finance, although the timing of the offering will depend on the SEC's review and market conditions. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin trades flat at $105,600.30 after recovering from an intraday dip, as miners' recent surge in exchange transfers signals potential volatility ahead. ETH: Ethereum held strong above critical $2,500 support amid volatility, closing bullishly near $2,534, as BlackRock's ETH ETF nears $5 billion on sustained institutional inflows. Gold: Gold trades slightly lower at $3,314.92 but heads for weekly gains, supported by weak U.S. jobs data despite easing U.S.-China tensions.
