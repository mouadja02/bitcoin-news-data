After announcing a break from perpetual trading on Hyperliquid, Wynn opened a massive 40x long position on Bitcoin, holding nearly 945 BTC, valued at about $99.6 million. Let’s find out where this other $100 million bet will pay him off, or will he face another setback? Break From Perpetual Trading on Hyperliquid In a recent tweet, James Wynn said he wanted to take a break from perpetual trading. Therefore, he sold all 126,116 HYPE tokens he had at an average price of $32.72, making around $4.13 million from the sale. This sale happened on Hyperliquid, a decentralized exchange that has seen a big jump in trading activity. I've decided to give perp trading a break. Thank you @HyperliquidX for your hospitality. Your service, impeccable. Your platform exquisite. Its been a fun ride. Approx $4m into $100m and then back down to a total account loss of $17,500,000. The time has come for me to… — James Wynn (@JamesWynnReal) June 2, 2025 Wynn had originally bought these HYPE tokens on May 9 and 12 at an average price of $24.84, spending about $3.13 million. This means he made an estimated profit of $1 million, a gain of about 31.9%. Even though Wynn has left perpetual trading for now, he had some kind words for Hyperliquid, calling it an “impeccable” service and thanking them for their support. Wynn‘s $100 Million Bet On Bitcoin Just 2 hours after selling all the HYPE tokens, Spotonchain data show that Wynn has opened a massive $100 million long position on Bitcoin, holding nearly 945 BTC. What’s more shocking is that he’s using 40x leverage on this trade, making this trade very risky. His entry price was around $105,890 per Bitcoin, but the position is already showing a loss of $455,000. With a liquidation price of $104,580. Wynn is walking a thin line, if Bitcoin’s price drops below this level, his position could be wiped out, causing a significant loss.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/james-wynn-returns-with-a-100m-bitcoin-bet-after-ditching-hyperliquid-perps/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|ZRX","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-02T10:55:23,"ETH Price Rally Incoming? Ethereum Funds See $321M Inflows","Key Takeaways: Ethereum funds saw $321 million in inflows last week, extending a six-week streak. ETH price remains range-bound and needs to break above $2,500–$2,520 to turn bullish. Broader crypto funds added $286 million, though market volatility weighed on total assets. Ethereum is back in the spotlight after institutional investors poured $321 million into ETH investment products last week, its largest weekly inflow since December 2024. The latest inflows extend Ethereum’s streak to six consecutive weeks, bringing the total to $1.19 billion over that period, according to new data from asset manager CoinShares. The strong capital inflows signal growing bullish sentiment around the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Digital Asset Funds See $286M in Inflows The broader digital asset market also saw inflows last week, with $286 million entering crypto investment products globally. However, total assets under management (AuM) dipped from a record $187 billion to $177 billion as prices pulled back on renewed market volatility, partly driven by uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policy. Regionally, U.S.-based funds still led with $199 million in inflows, followed by Hong Kong with $54.8 million, its strongest post-ETF launch week, and Germany with $42.9 million. Switzerland recorded outflows of $32.8 million. Bitcoin saw a mixed week. The top cryptocurrency began the week with positive flows, but momentum reversed mid-week after a U.S. court ruling on tariffs rattled markets. Bitcoin products ended the week with a modest $8 million in outflows, breaking a six-week inflow streak that had totaled $9.6 billion. Meanwhile, XRP funds posted $28.2 million in outflows, marking a second consecutive week of investor pullback. As reported, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recorded $430.8 million in outflows on May 30, ending a 31-day inflow streak — its longest since launch. The move marks IBIT’s largest single-day outflow to date, according to Farside data, following a month where BlackRock added $6.2 billion in Bitcoin. Despite the pullback, IBIT’s total Bitcoin holdings now stand at around $70 billion. Eth Needs to Reclaim $2,500–$2,520 Zone to Turn Bullish Ethereum is currently trading around $2,482 after a period of sideways movement. On the 1-hour chart, ETH remains range-bound between approximately $2,475 and $2,555. Bollinger Bands have narrowed in recent sessions, indicating reduced volatility. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 36.23, suggesting ETH is nearing oversold territory. Meanwhile, the MACD remains negative (-3.66), showing a bearish bias, though momentum appears to be stabilizing. Zooming into the 1-minute chart, ETH continues to hover near $2,483 with intraday resistance around $2,493 and support near $2,477. The RSI is more neutral at 46.32, while the MACD has flipped slightly positive (0.61), hinting at short-term buying interest. However, the price action remains choppy, with no clear breakout yet. In the broader context, ETH inflows of $321 million last week reflect growing institutional demand. However, the current technical setup suggests ETH needs to reclaim the $2,500–$2,520 zone to regain bullish momentum. Failure to hold above $2,475 could open the door to further downside toward $2,400. The post ETH Price Rally Incoming?

2025-06-02T10:52:01,"Hope for Altcoins? Analysts Predict Epic Finale to This Bull Cycle","A lot of market dynamics witnessed in past bull cycles have played out differently in this one. One of them is the on-chain patterns and trends that precede altcoin seasons, which refer to periods when alternative cryptocurrencies outperform bitcoin (BTC). While traders are skeptical that the market will witness an altseason before this cycle is over, analysts at the on-chain data intelligence platform CryptoQuant believe that all hope is not yet lost. Investors still stand a chance to make profits with altcoins in this cycle. Not Time to Lose Hope In previous cycles, BTC rallies were preceded by a steady decrease in the proportion of mid-to-long-term holding volumes. With new capital flowing into the market at the time, altcoins eventually surged towards the end of those cycles. However, the opposite has been the case this time; mid-to-long-term holding volumes have surged each time BTC rallies to new highs. According to pseudonymous analyst Crypto Dan, the price movement of altcoins in this cycle has tallied with that of BTC. Bitcoin has constantly faced corrections after small gains in this cycle, and during those dips, altcoins have also suffered significant declines, indicating overall weakness. The current bull cycle is nearing its final stages, and at this phase, it is almost impossible for investors to make profits with altcoins. However, since altcoin rallies have corresponded with BTC surges, Dan insists there is still hope. When Altseason? Bitcoin is yet to experience its final leg for this cycle, which means the asset’s dominance is likely to decrease. If the market plays out as Dan predicts, then altcoins may experience higher rallies than seen in previous patterns when bitcoin’s dominance plummets, marking the end of the cycle. Hence, all indicators point to bitcoin’s next upward move, which could occur at any moment from now. “It’s not time to abandon hope just yet. Since we’re already in the latter half of the cycle, it’s worth waiting for Bitcoin’s next upward move,” Dan stated. It is worth mentioning that Dan is not the only analyst who believes altcoins still stand a chance. CryptoPotato reported that many other traders and analysts believe this altseason will be epic, making the rally seen in 2021 seem tiny. However, some have warned that not all tokens will go up during the altcoin season. Only a few chosen assets will record significant gains as they attract new liquidity. The post Hope for Altcoins?

IG Group, one of the biggest online trading firms listed on the London Stock Exchange, just opened the door for British investors to buy and sell 31 cryptocurrencies directly. No CFDs, no speculation on prices – real, actual tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even Dogecoin! Why does this matter? Because it signals that crypto is stepping out of the shadows and into the mainstream UK market. Crypto is finally getting its seat on the table. Here’s a deep dive. Why Spot Trading Changes the Game IG’s move is a clear departure from its past approach. Previously, crypto exposure came only through CFDs which are complex financial products that let you bet on price moves without owning anything. Now, customers can trade actual coins. Michael Healy, IG’s UK managing director, didn’t hold back calling this “a major milestone in the UK’s crypto journey.” It’s hard to disagree when you realize how big a leap this is – not just for IG, but for the whole British crypto ecosystem. Why IG Chose a US Partner for This Move Backing this launch is Uphold, a US-based digital asset platform regulated in both the US and UK. They’ll manage all transactions and pricing data, which means IG isn’t doing this alone. That’s crucial. After years of regulatory warnings and caution, having a partner that’s well-regulated on both sides of the Atlantic adds much-needed credibility and security. The Market Has Spoken: Crypto Is A Must-Have Remember when the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority warned that investors should be ready to “lose all their money” in crypto? Fast forward, and nearly 12% of UK adults have owned crypto at some point, up from just 4% in 2021. Healy summed it up: “Crypto is no longer a fringe asset class. Our clients want secure, reliable access to digital tokens from a trusted provider and as a UK-listed, regulated company, we’re ideally placed to meet that need.” New Chapter for UK Crypto! The government’s plans to regulate digital assets, spearheaded by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, aim to make Britain a “world leader” in crypto. That push couldn’t come at a better time. After pausing its retail crypto products in 2021 due to FCA restrictions, IG is back with a bang and this time offering the real deal. This is the best signal that crypto in the UK is ready to grow up and play by the rules. If you’ve been waiting for crypto to become truly accessible, regulated, and backed by established players, IG’s latest move might just be the start you’ve been waiting for.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ig-group-launches-crypto-trading-in-uk-of-bitcoin-ethereum-and-29-more-tokens/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

2025-06-02T10:30:44,"SEC Raises Crucial Questions on Ethereum and Solana Staking ETFs","BitcoinWorld SEC Raises Crucial Questions on Ethereum and Solana Staking ETFs Are you following the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency investments? A significant development is currently unfolding that could impact how investors gain exposure to popular digital assets like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) through regulated products. The U.S. SEC is reportedly scrutinizing proposed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that aim to include staking rewards, potentially adding another layer of complexity to the journey towards wider crypto adoption in traditional finance. The Latest SEC Inquiry into Staking ETFs According to recent reports from Bloomberg, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) has initiated discussions with firms proposing innovative crypto investment products. Specifically, the regulatory body is questioning the structure of planned Staking ETF products from REX Financial and Osprey Funds. These firms are seeking to launch ETFs that would not only hold ETH and SOL but also engage in staking activities to generate yield for investors. The core of the SEC’s concern centers on whether these products would qualify as ‘investment companies’ under federal securities law. This classification has significant implications for how a fund must be regulated and structured. REX Financial’s general counsel, Greg Collett, has acknowledged the SEC’s questions, stating that the firm believes it can address these concerns. Importantly, REX will not proceed with the launch of their proposed funds until these regulatory hurdles are cleared. Understanding Staking ETFs: What Are They? Before diving deeper into the regulatory challenges, let’s clarify what a Staking ETF intends to do. Traditional ETFs often hold assets like stocks, bonds, or even cryptocurrencies (like the spot Bitcoin ETFs recently approved). A staking ETF aims to go a step further by participating in the staking process available on certain blockchain networks, such as Ethereum (post-Merge) and Solana. Staking involves locking up cryptocurrency assets to support the operations and security of a proof-of-stake blockchain. In return for contributing to the network’s validation process, stakers earn rewards, typically in the form of additional cryptocurrency. A staking ETF would essentially pool investor funds, purchase the underlying crypto (ETH or SOL), stake it, and potentially distribute the staking rewards back to the ETF shareholders. The potential benefits for investors include: Yield Generation: Earning passive income from staking rewards in addition to potential price appreciation of the underlying asset. Convenience: Accessing staking without the technical complexity, minimum balance requirements, or lock-up periods often associated with direct staking. Regulatory Wrapper: Investing through a familiar, regulated financial product (an ETF). Why the SEC is Concerned About ‘Investment Company’ Status The U.S. SEC ‘s line of questioning regarding the ‘investment company’ status of these proposed funds is a critical point. The Investment Company Act of 1940 governs entities that primarily engage in investing, reinvesting, or trading in securities. Funds classified under this act are subject to stringent regulations regarding structure, operations, and investor protection. The SEC’s concern likely stems from the active nature of staking. While simply holding crypto might be viewed differently, actively participating in network validation, earning rewards, and potentially managing those rewards could lead the SEC to view the fund’s activities as crossing the threshold into being an ‘investment company’ that needs to comply with the 1940 Act. This could impose significant operational and compliance burdens on the fund structure proposed by REX and Osprey. The distinction the SEC is drawing might relate to whether the staking activity constitutes managing an investment portfolio for others, which is a hallmark of an investment company. Navigating this legal interpretation in the context of novel blockchain activities is a new frontier for both regulators and fund issuers. What This Means for Ethereum ETF and Solana ETF Aspirants This development specifically impacts firms like REX and Osprey aiming for a Ethereum ETF and Solana ETF with staking components. It signals that simply getting a spot crypto ETF approved might not clear the path for products that incorporate yield-generating activities like staking. For the broader market, this raises questions about the future of yield-bearing crypto products within regulated ETF structures in the U.S. While spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved earlier this year, Bitcoin’s network (Proof-of-Work) does not involve staking in the same way Ethereum and Solana (Proof-of-Stake) do. This difference in consensus mechanisms presents unique regulatory challenges for ETH and SOL-based products. It suggests that firms may need to either: Find a way to structure the staking ETF that satisfies the SEC’s concerns about the ‘investment company’ definition. Propose non-staking versions of Ethereum and Solana ETFs first, similar to the approved Bitcoin ETFs. Engage in potentially lengthy legal and regulatory discussions to clarify how staking fits within existing securities laws. The Path Forward for Crypto ETF Innovation The dialogue between the SEC and fund issuers like REX and Osprey is a crucial step in defining the boundaries for Crypto ETF innovation in the U.S. While it introduces uncertainty and potential delays for staking ETFs, it also represents the regulatory process at work, attempting to fit new technologies into existing legal frameworks. The outcome of these discussions will be closely watched by the entire crypto industry and traditional finance. A clear path for staking ETFs could unlock significant capital and provide investors with regulated access to yield from major proof-of-stake assets. Conversely, significant regulatory hurdles could push firms towards simpler spot ETH or SOL ETFs first, or potentially stifle certain types of crypto-linked products in the U.S. market for the time being. Key Takeaways: The SEC is actively reviewing proposed ETH and SOL staking ETFs. The main regulatory hurdle is the ‘investment company’ classification under the 1940 Act. Firms like REX are working to address these concerns before launching. This highlights the ongoing challenge of fitting novel crypto activities like staking into existing financial regulations. The resolution will impact the availability of yield-generating crypto products in the U.S. ETF market. Conclusion: Navigating the Regulatory Waters The U.S. SEC ‘s questioning of Staking ETF proposals from REX and Osprey underscores the complex regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrency products. While firms are eager to bring innovative products like a Ethereum ETF and Solana ETF with staking to market, they must first navigate the intricate web of federal securities laws. The focus on the ‘investment company’ status reveals a specific area of regulatory scrutiny related to the active yield-generating nature of staking. The industry awaits further clarity, which will ultimately shape the types of regulated crypto investment vehicles available to U.S. investors in the future.

Price prediction suggests potential to reach $2.05 by year-end 2025. Long-term forecasts indicate ADA could hit $10.25 by 2030. The Plomin Hard Fork, which activated in Q1 2025, has significantly enhanced Cardano’s appeal to investors by establishing full decentralized governance. This is seen as a key milestone that aligns with the blockchain’s long-term vision of community-driven decision-making. Despite these advancements, bullish attraction post-Plomin Hard Fork was tempered by market dynamics and challenges, on its price chart. However, in Q2 2025, things seem to have changed , as a variety of optimistic factors surround the altcoin sector, which is benefiting the ADA price. As a result, Cardano price prediction is heating up again in the community. With bullish technical signals, major upgrades, and ETF hopes rising , many are intrigued to know, “Is ADA Price ready for a massive breakout?” Here’s a detailed ADA price prediction for 2025 and beyond, including expert targets up to 2050. Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Assuming that Cardano continues to focus on the network’s upcoming updates, we can expect a wider adoption rate. Even the ETF odds has higher approval rate that could bring large crowd wil multi-billion dollars into the asset, once approved. Therefore, we expect the ADA price to reach $2.05 in 2025.

However, this rally triggered significant supply pressure, pushing the price into a declining wedge pattern. In April 2025, during Q2, bearish forces made a strong attempt to break the key support zone around $0.60. Yet, the bulls managed to defend this level, providing ADA with the support it needed to bounce back. Riding the bullish momentum, ADA climbed above a high-volume profile level, forming a series of higher highs and higher lows. This uptrend lasted until mid-May, when the price reached $0.85. However, the optimism was short-lived. The second half of May turned bearish. A potential bearish crossover is forming between the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands, and the RSI has slipped below the median line to 38.34—indicating a loss of bullish conviction and increasing bearish strength. Within the wedge, ADA also witnessed a symmetrical triangle breakdown due to rising bearish pressure. For this breakdown to be confirmed, the price needs to close below last month’s swing low of $0.6450. If that happens, the decline could extend to $0.60 and even $0.40. On the flip side, if bullish momentum returns and ADA manages a close above the $0.77 resistance level, it would invalidate the triangle breakdown. A breakout above this level could open the door for a rally toward $1.10 by June 2025—a major resistance level that has held since mid-December 2024. Moreover, the Cardano liquidation map over the past 7 days highlights a growing strength in bearish positions. The cumulative short-leverage positions—marked in green—indicate a significant surge in bearish interest. This suggests that traders are heavily betting on a short-term decline in ADA’s price, adding further pressure to its already fragile technical setup. In addition, one of the clearest warning signs for ADA is the steady decline in funding rates. This trend often reflects growing bearish sentiment among traders and could contribute to sustained downward pressure. With no strong catalyst currently in sight, the market appears to lack the momentum needed for a breakout in the short term. ADA Price Prediction 2025 Source: coincarp Cardano has always prioritized decentralization, and the recent Plomin hard fork has taken it a step further. Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp’s rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet’s circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. To push ADA’s price beyond the $1.10 to $1.20 range, strong retail participation will be necessary. A potential catalyst for this could be the approval of an ADA ETF , which experts believe could launch by the end of this year and attract billions in inflows.If ADA manages to sustain levels above its Q1 2025 high , there’s a solid chance it could retest the $2.05 mark by year-end.

2025-06-02T10:20:26,"Bitfinex Alpha | Volatile Markets Expected","Review Full Report Subscribe to Bitfinex Alpha Bitcoin is undergoing its first meaningful correction since the April lows, cooling off after a relentless 50 percent surge that took the asset from $74,501 to a new All-Time High of $111,880. The current pullback reflects a change in tempo, following nearly 50 days of uninterrupted upside marked by minimal retracements. This retracement is not just technical—it comes amid renewed macro pressure following the unexpected reinstatement of tariffs by the US government, resulting in a breakout in 30-year Treasury yields above 5 percent, and a wave of risk-off sentiment. At the same time, Bitcoin’s derivatives markets are showing some signs of overheating. Options open interest has climbed to an All-Time High of $49.4 billion—highlighting elevated institutional activity and increased hedging/speculation following the recent Bitcoin ATH. Such positioning suggests that the market is expecting heightened volatility ahead, with expectations of further macro headwinds and structural profit-taking. On-chain metrics corroborate this: the Relative Unrealised Profit indicator has broken above its +2 standard deviation band, a historically euphoric zone that typically precedes sharp intraday swings and local tops. Despite the pullback, we believe Bitcoin remains structurally strong. This correction appears to be a healthy reset rather than a breakdown—driven by leverage flushing and profit realisation after one of the sharpest recoveries in crypto history. In contrast, the US economy is showing signs of strain as consumers and businesses navigate a landscape marked by trade tensions, cooling demand, and policy uncertainty. Consumer spending slowed significantly in April, with households favouring savings over discretionary purchases amid growing concerns about the long-term effects of tariffs. While inflation remains subdued for now, this may be temporary as businesses begin to pass on higher costs from elevated tariffs. Trade dynamics have also shifted sharply. Imports fell nearly 20 percent in April after a front-loading rush to beat tariff hikes in the first quarter, which in turn caused the goods trade deficit to shrink by 46 percent. Although this narrowing trade gap could support GDP in the short term, business inventories remained flat, signalling hesitation to invest or restock. In parallel, orders for core capital goods —an indicator of business investment—dropped 1.3 percent, the steepest decline since October, pointing to growing corporate caution. The labour market is also showing early signs of stress, with continuing jobless claims hitting their highest level since 2021 and firms increasingly freezing hiring plans. Corporate profits fell sharply in Q1, and sentiment among business leaders has weakened. Even with a temporary trade truce between the US and China, confidence remains fragile. While consumer sentiment rebounded in May, underpinned by hopes of tariff relief, both businesses and households are adopting a cautious, wait-and-see approach. The cryptocurrency industry has seen a wave of significant developments across corporate, regulatory, and event global financial sectors. GameStop , the well-known meme-stock made headlines with a bold $513 million investment in Bitcoin, marking a strategic shift toward financial diversification amid declining sales. This move aligns the company with a growing list of firms integrating Bitcoin into their treasury strategies, though it also sparked investor unease over crypto market volatility and the company’s limited experience in managing digital assets. Meanwhile, the US Department of Labor rescinded its 2022 guidance that discouraged the inclusion of cryptocurrencies in 401(k) retirement plans, signalling a more neutral stance. This change allows fiduciaries greater flexibility to evaluate crypto investments for retirement portfolios, reflecting the digital asset market’s growing maturity and improved regulatory clarity. On the global stage, the Bank of Russia authorized financial institutions to offer crypto-linked financial instruments to qualified investors. Although these products are non-deliverable and tightly regulated, the decision marks a cautious yet significant step toward integrating digital assets into Russia’s financial system. Collectively, these developments underscore a broader trend: cryptocurrencies are moving from the fringes into mainstream financial systems, prompting innovation while raising the stakes for sound regulation and risk management.

At the recently concluded ETHGlobal Prague, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin revealed that the layer 1 blockchain is set to undergo a significant upgrade over the next year. Responding to questions about Ethereum scalability goals, he stated “we should scale L1 about 10x over the next year and a bit.” NEW: VITALIK BUTERIN SAYS ETHEREUM'S LAYER 1 WILL SCALE ROUGHLY 10X WITHIN A YEAR, THEN PAUSE FOR A PERIOD BEFORE ITS NEXT MAJOR UPGRADE pic.twitter.com/vxJVSDuqDd — The Wolf Of All Streets (@scottmelker) June 1, 2025 A key goal of the timeline is to take a steady approach to the upgrade. Buterin emphasized the importance of “scaling safely,” highlighting the need to balance scalability improvements with preserving decentralization. Buterin added that following the scaling upgrade there will be a pause period to assess the network before proceeding to its next subsequent upgrade. “At that point, it will be a good time to take a breather and have a period to verify that we are actually doing okay on decentralization properties,” he noted, adding that the pause will also give developers time to tie up loose ends and refine key improvements.

In a seperate conversation with cLabs CTO & co-founder Marek Olszewski, the Ethereum co-founder added that the incoming solutions will ensure improvements to the broader ecosystem. “Increasing block sizes on Layer 1 creates more space and makes it easier for Layer 2 solutions to operate securely and efficiently,” he explained. Ethereum’s native token ( ETH ) has seen minimal price movement over the past 24 hours, posting a minor 0.03% gain to trade slightly above $2,500. Despite the short-term stability, ETH is still down roughly 10% from its monthly high .

2025-06-02T10:10:33,"US Bitcoin ETF Inflows: Explosive $5.2B May Signals Strong Demand","BitcoinWorld US Bitcoin ETF Inflows: Explosive $5.2B May Signals Strong Demand Get ready for some eye-popping numbers! May proved to be a powerhouse month for US Bitcoin ETF inflows , showcasing robust demand from investors, particularly those operating within traditional finance. The figures are in, and they paint a clear picture of growing interest in gaining exposure to Bitcoin through regulated, accessible investment vehicles. What’s Behind the Surge in US Bitcoin ETF Inflows? According to data shared by crypto market observer Trader T on X, U.S. spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) saw a significant net inflow of $5.2 billion throughout the month of May. To put that into perspective, this monumental inflow is equivalent to roughly 50,000 BTC being added to the holdings of these investment products over just 31 days. This follows a period of more modest inflows or even outflows in prior months, making May’s performance particularly notable. Looking at the broader second quarter of 2025 so far, the total net inflows into these US-based Bitcoin ETFs have reached an impressive milestone of approximately 80,000 BTC . This cumulative figure underscores a strengthening trend throughout Q2, suggesting that May wasn’t just a flash in the pan but part of sustained interest. The primary driver behind this significant surge appears to be increasing appetite from institutions and professional investors who are becoming more comfortable allocating capital to Bitcoin via the ETF structure. ETFs offer a familiar, regulated wrapper that simplifies compliance and integration into traditional portfolios compared to direct spot Bitcoin purchases or other less regulated products. Breaking Down the May Bitcoin ETF Investment Landscape While the overall picture is one of strong positive flows, a closer look at individual fund performance reveals distinct trends within the Bitcoin ETF investment space. The market saw a clear leader emerge, alongside some continued outflows from existing products. Here’s a snapshot of the key figures for May: ETF Ticker Fund Name May Net Flow Notes IBIT BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust +$5.9 billion Leading the pack by a significant margin GBTC Grayscale Bitcoin Trust -$421 million Continued, albeit slowing, outflows ARKB ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF -$292 million Experiencing outflows during the month Other ETFs (Fidelity, Bitwise, etc.) ~-$287 million (estimated net) Mixed performance among smaller funds Total Net Inflow All US Spot Bitcoin ETFs +$5.2 billion Strong overall positive movement BlackRock’s IBIT fund was the undisputed heavyweight champion of May inflows, attracting a staggering $5.9 billion. This performance highlights BlackRock’s massive reach and the trust placed in their brand by large investors. Their competitive fee structure and broad distribution network likely contributed significantly to this dominance. On the other hand, Grayscale’s GBTC continued to see outflows, though at a much slower pace than in the initial weeks following its conversion to a spot ETF. These outflows are often attributed to investors taking profits, rebalancing portfolios, or switching to newer ETFs with lower management fees. ARK Invest’s ARKB also experienced outflows in May, indicating some rotation or repositioning among investors holding various Bitcoin ETF products. How Are May Bitcoin ETF Inflows Impacting Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? The substantial inflows recorded in May are a powerful indicator of accelerating institutional Bitcoin adoption. While retail investors certainly participate in these ETFs, the sheer volume and the types of firms likely utilizing products from major asset managers like BlackRock point towards increasing institutional involvement. Why are institutions favoring these ETFs? The reasons are multifaceted: Regulatory Clarity: Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. operate under established securities regulations, providing a level of compliance and oversight that traditional institutions require. Ease of Access: These products can be bought and sold through standard brokerage accounts, integrating seamlessly into existing investment workflows and portfolio management systems. No Custody Hassle: Institutions are relieved of the complex and often burdensome task of securely holding and managing private keys for actual Bitcoin. Liquidity: High trading volumes in the major ETFs ensure that institutions can enter and exit positions efficiently without significant market impact. The consistent buying pressure from these large inflows suggests that institutions view Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but increasingly as a legitimate component for diversification or a hedge within broader investment strategies. This trend is crucial for the long-term maturation and stability of the Bitcoin market. What Do These May Bitcoin ETF Numbers Mean for Crypto Market Trends? The strong performance of US spot Bitcoin ETFs in May has significant implications for broader crypto market trends . These inflows represent sustained, external capital entering the Bitcoin ecosystem, absorbing available supply on exchanges and potentially putting upward pressure on price. Unlike the more volatile swings often associated with retail trading sentiment, institutional flows tend to be larger, more strategic, and indicative of longer-term positioning. The consistent demand demonstrated in May suggests underlying strength in the market structure, providing a potential counterbalance to selling pressure from other sources. Furthermore, the success of Bitcoin ETFs could pave the way for other crypto-based ETFs in the future, potentially opening up traditional investment channels for other digital assets and further integrating the crypto market with global finance. Navigating the Landscape: Opportunities and Challenges in Bitcoin ETF Investment For investors considering participating in the Bitcoin ETF investment landscape, May’s data highlights both compelling opportunities and important considerations: Opportunities: Simplified Exposure: Easily add Bitcoin exposure to a traditional investment portfolio. Diversification: Bitcoin can offer diversification benefits due to its low correlation with traditional assets (though this can change). Potential for Growth: Continued institutional adoption fueled by inflows could drive significant future price appreciation. Liquidity: High trading volume makes buying and selling straightforward. Challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin remains a highly volatile asset, and ETF value will fluctuate accordingly. Fees: While competitive, ETFs have management fees that can impact long-term returns compared to holding spot Bitcoin directly (though direct holding has its own costs/risks). Tracking Error: ETFs aim to track the price of Bitcoin, but small discrepancies can occur. Market Risk: The value is tied directly to the performance of Bitcoin, which can be influenced by global macro factors, regulatory news, and market sentiment. Actionable Insight: Investors should consider their risk tolerance and investment goals. While the inflows are positive news, they don’t eliminate the inherent risks of the crypto market. Researching specific ETF fees, structures, and the reputation of the issuer is crucial before investing. The Future Outlook May’s strong performance sets a positive tone for the remainder of Q2 and beyond. If these inflow trends continue, they could absorb a significant portion of the new Bitcoin supply entering the market post-halving and potentially lead to further price discovery. However, the market is dynamic. Factors such as changes in macroeconomic policy, further regulatory developments, or shifts in institutional sentiment could influence future flow patterns. Monitoring these ETF numbers provides a vital pulse check on institutional engagement with the leading cryptocurrency. Conclusion The $5.2 billion in net inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs in May, contributing to an 80,000 BTC total for Q2 so far, is a powerful testament to increasing investor confidence and adoption. Led by BlackRock’s dominant performance, these figures underscore the growing significance of institutional capital in the Bitcoin market. While challenges and volatility remain, the strong demand through regulated ETF channels signals a maturing market and highlights Bitcoin’s increasing integration into traditional finance. These inflows are a key indicator for anyone tracking the evolution of the crypto landscape.

2025-06-02T10:08:52,"Cardano’s Hoskinson Predicts $500K Bitcoin, Teases XRP DeFi Integration","The post Cardano’s Hoskinson Predicts $500K Bitcoin, Teases XRP DeFi Integration appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson just made a bold call that has Bitcoin enthusiasts buzzing. At the recent Bitcoin Conference, he predicted Bitcoin could hit anywhere between $250,000-$500,000 in the coming years. But that wasn’t all. Hoskinson also shared Cardano’s latest moves in decentralized finance (DeFi), including plans to integrate XRP into its growing ecosystem. His long-term vision? A $10 trillion Bitcoin market backed by new infrastructure, smart contract layers, and real-world DeFi use cases that expand well beyond Bitcoin alone. Sounds exciting. Let’s dive in. Hoskinson’s Bitcoin Price Outlook Speaking during a session hosted by Input Output Global (IOG), Hoskinson said the path to a six-figure Bitcoin is being driven by increasing inflows and the shift toward Bitcoin as a store of value that now also taps into the power of DeFi. He looked back at Bitcoin’s early days, where small-scale mining and peer-to-peer transfers were the norm, contrasting them with today’s large mining operations and evolving network needs. While Bitcoin has held onto its original principles, its limitations are becoming more visible today. Bitcoin’s Core Principles vs. DeFi Potential Hoskinson pointed out three key rules that have always defined Bitcoin: All transactions must use only BTC Fees must be paid in BTC Yield must come only from BTC These rules help protect Bitcoin’s identity but have made DeFi integration extremely difficult. That’s where Cardano’s new approach comes in. Hoskinson introduced a modular infrastructure stack designed to add DeFi compatibility to Bitcoin without changing its core. He mentioned projects like Sundial, the Bitcoin Operating System, and work from infrastructure players such as Sergey Lerner and the Fairgate team as examples of how this can be achieved. He also highlighted new wallet designs from IOG that let users switch between regular Bitcoin use and DeFi features, while still using BTC for everything. This opens the door to lending, borrowing, and more – without compromising Bitcoin’s core ideals. Today at @TheBitcoinConf we demoed how we’re bringing Bitcoin and Cardano together. Bitcoin has the reach, but DeFi unlocks its full potential. We’re building the technology to bridge them. Everyone deserves access to the global economy. Be part of it. #Bitcoin2025 pic.twitter.com/K8r2qLR1fH — Input Output (@InputOutputHK) May 27, 2025 Cardano’s Bold XRP DeFi Integration Plan Hoskinson also confirmed that Cardano is working to bring XRP into its DeFi ecosystem, tapping into XRP’s strong reputation for cross-border payments. This integration could help form a seamless, scalable multi-chain ecosystem where Bitcoin, XRP, and Cardano can operate together – boosting financial access and inclusion worldwide. “Everyone deserves access to the economy,” InputOutput stated on X , sparking excitement among crypto enthusiasts. Exciting Times Ahead Hoskinson’s bold prediction of a Bitcoin price surge and Cardano’s DeFi breakthroughs signal a progressive time ahead for crypto. By introducing XRP into DeFi and enabling deeper interoperability between Bitcoin and other networks, Cardano is making a strong move to establish itself as a leader in next-gen blockchain development.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/cardanos-hoskinson-predicts-500k-bitcoin-teases-xrp-defi-integration/,"ADA|BTC|MINING|TRADING|XRP","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-02T10:06:48,"Silk Road founder receives 300 BTC donation from ‘questionable source’","Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht’s crypto wallet recently received a mysterious donation in the form of 300 BTC. Many traders suspected it was a self-transfer, but crypto sleuth ZachXBT found the source to be ‘questionable.’ According to data from on-chain analysis platform Arkham Intelligence, Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht’s crypto wallet received 300.001 BTC ( BTC ) on May 30. The donation came from an unknown wallet , before it was moved by Ulbricht to a different wallet a day later. At current market prices, the 300 BTC donation is worth around $31.7 million. At press time, Bitcoin has gone up by 1.26% in the past 24 hours. The largest cryptocurrency by market cap has been trading hands at $105,666. Initially, traders suspected the BTC donation was actually a self-transfer from the Silk Road founder’s own funds. This theory came from social media users who speculated that Ulbricht still had funds hidden away from his Silk Road days before he was sentenced to imprisonment. However, on-chain investigator ZachXBT believed the BTC transfer was unlikely to come from Ulbricht himself. “It likely doesn’t appear to be a self donation as people were claiming though it comes from a questionable sources due to the flagged address,” said ZachXBT in his post . The transaction history of Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht showing a 300 BTC transfer, June 2, 2025 | Source: Arkham Intelligence You might also like: Ross Ulbricht-linked wallets lost $12m in meme coin blunder ZachXBT was able to track the funds’ origin back to a suspicious centralized Bitcoin mixing service called Jambler. He stated that Jambler was an odd choice, considering most traders tend to use the more widely used decentralized privacy tools like Wasabi or Samourai. Meanwhile, he said very few entities regularly use Jambler for large funds. Not only that, the blockchain investigator also discovered that it was likely the 300 BTC originated from two dormant addresses. One address was created in 2014, while the other wallet was active back in 2019. However, the second wallet was previously flagged as suspicious by compliance tools. Moreover, ZachXBT found that the two wallets had previously deposited large amounts of crypto into Jambler sometime between April and May. The on-chain investigator noted that the deposits match the timing of the donation sent to Ulbricht’s wallet. Ever since he was released from prison thanks to a pardon from President Trump last January, the Silk Road founder has been trying to auction some of his personal belongings. So far, he has raised more than $1.8 million worth of BTC from the sales, garnering support from the crypto community. Most recently, Tron ( TRX ) founder Justin Sun gifted Ulbricht the iconic banana and duct tape artwork dubbed the “Comedian” on May 30. Sun previously purchased the art installation from Sotheby’s in an auction at a final bid of $6.2 million.

2025-06-02T10:05:08,"Japanese Investment Firm Metaplanet Bought Bitcoin Again! How Much Time Left to 10,000 Bitcoin Target? Here Are the Details","Japanese investment firm Metaplanet announced that it has purchased an additional 1,088 Bitcoin (BTC), bringing its total holdings to 8,888 BTC. Japanese Metaplanet Buys Another 1,088 Bitcoins Its current value is over $930 million. The acquisition strengthens Metaplanet’s position as Asia’s largest publicly traded Bitcoin holder and one of the top 10 institutional Bitcoin holders globally. The latest purchase, which was made at an average price of 15.5 million yen ($108,051) per BTC, cost the company 16.885 billion yen (about $117.5 million). The announcement comes after Metaplanet recently issued $50 million in zero-interest bonds, signaling that its aggressive approach to Bitcoin accumulation will continue. With this acquisition, Metaplanet has moved one step closer to its year-end goal of 10,000 BTC, having acquired 7,126 BTC in 2025 alone. Since adopting a Bitcoin treasury strategy in April 2024, the company has rapidly risen among institutional holders, drawing parallels with US software firm MicroStrategy, which continues to lead the global market with 580,250 BTC. Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich has openly cited MicroStrategy and its chairman Michael Saylor as the inspiration behind the firm’s Bitcoin-centric strategy. Gerovich has previously outlined the firm’s long-term vision, saying, “Bitcoin is the foundation of a new financial paradigm.” Metaplanet’s success has spurred similar moves from other companies, including Twenty One, led by Bitcoin advocate Jack Mallers. Beyond Bitcoin, a growing number of firms are now turning to Ether, XRP, Solana, and other digital assets to build crypto-based corporate treasuries. Following the announcement, Metaplanet shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose 2.34% to 1,094 yen as of 1:15 p.m. local time. The stock has risen more than twentyfold in the past year, according to Yahoo Finance data. However, its U.S. OTC-listed shares (MTPLF) closed down 7.64% at $7.25 on Friday. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price continues to consolidate and is currently trading around $105,000 after retreating from an all-time high of $111,800 last week. Market watchers see Metaplanet’s ongoing accumulation as a strong vote of confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory amid ongoing institutional adoption. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-02T10:02:52,"Metaplanet buys 1,088 more BTC, becoming eighth-largest corporate holder","Japanese investment firm Metaplanet Inc. has announced the acquisition of 1,088 additional BTC, a move that has elevated its total Bitcoin holdings to over 8,888 BTC, according to both the company’s public disclosure and a post on its official X account. Metaplanet Inc. @Metaplanet_JP · Follow *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 1,088 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 8,888 BTC* 6:04 AM · Jun 2, 2025 237 Reply Copy link Read 16 replies The acquisition, valued at approximately ¥16.885 billion or $117.9 million, was executed at an average price of ¥15,519,019 per Bitcoin, which is equivalent to around $108,400 per coin. Metaplanet is now the eighth-largest BTC holder Following this substantial purchase, Metaplanet has overtaken both Block Inc. and Galaxy Digital in total corporate Bitcoin holdings, climbing to the eighth position globally, based on the latest data compiled by Bitbo. This strategic move underscores the firm’s growing ambition to spearhead Bitcoin adoption in Asia, particularly at a time when macroeconomic uncertainty continues to rattle traditional markets, including government bonds. The market context surrounding Metaplanet’s investment reveals a broader trend, as large institutions increasingly view Bitcoin not only as a hedge but also as a potential source of strong returns amid global fiscal instability. Metaplanet’s confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value was further illustrated in its official filing, which noted that the firm’s average acquisition cost now stands at ¥13,756,658 per BTC, reflecting a disciplined yet bullish accumulation strategy. The company has already achieved significant unrealised gains, reporting a quarter-to-date Bitcoin yield of 66.3% and a total Bitcoin gain of 2,684 BTC as of June 2. In Japanese yen terms, Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin gains currently amount to over ¥40.5 billion, signalling strong performance driven by both strategic timing and sustained price momentum. Notably, Bitcoin (BTC) recently reached an all-time high above $112,000 before retracing to around $105,464, a movement analysts describe as a healthy correction. This correction is being seen as an opportunity to reset leveraged positions while laying a more stable foundation for the next potential breakout in Q3. Now with Bitcoin consolidating above $100,000 and analysts forecasting further upward movement, the timing of Metaplanet’s purchase appears well-aligned with prevailing market sentiment. This growing demand reflects institutional faith in the company’s strategy and perhaps an expectation that Bitcoin’s value could continue to rise amid worsening sovereign debt concerns. With more than 759 million fully diluted shares outstanding, Metaplanet now holds roughly 0.0117 BTC for every 1,000 shares, giving shareholders a clear line of exposure to the asset’s performance. Despite concerns about a potential bubble forming around Bitcoin proxy stocks, Metaplanet’s moves continue to attract strong investor interest, evidenced by the firm’s significant Bitcoin premium, which has recently exceeded $596,000. Such premiums suggest that investors are willing to pay far more than Bitcoin’s spot price to gain indirect exposure through Metaplanet’s publicly traded shares. Metaplanet’s aggressive strategy is not just confined to digital assets, as the company also recently approved the issuance of new stock acquisition rights through a third-party allotment to EVO FUND. This capital markets manoeuvre, involving up to $21 million of Ordinary Bonds issued across five tranches, is intended to bolster liquidity and fund further expansion of its Bitcoin Treasury operations. There is no doubt that Metaplanet’s bold accumulation strategy places it firmly at the centre of institutional Bitcoin adoption across Asia and beyond as the crypto landscape evolves.

2025-06-02T10:01:45,"Top Analyst Egrag Crypto Just Dropped a Bomb on XRP","In the ever-charged world of cryptocurrency, few voices command as much attention as Egrag Crypto, a renowned technical analyst whose chart projections have become a key compass for XRP traders and investors. Earlier today, Amonyx, a prominent crypto commentator on X, amplified a fresh update from Egrag that has sent waves of excitement through the XRP community. According to Amonyx’s post, Egrag’s latest chart signals that XRP is on the brink of a monumental surge, with price targets ranging from $10.70 to an eye-popping $55 and beyond. Chart Patterns Signal Historical Repetition As of report time, XRP is trading at $2.15, exhibiting a mere 1.05% price appreciation over the past day. What’s driving the latest hype is the technical structure outlined by Egrag Crypto. He describes the current phase as “Move 1”, a setup phase that has historically preceded XRP’s strongest breakouts. The next anticipated phase, “Move 2,” is where the fireworks are expected: a sharp liftoff that could catapult XRP into uncharted price territories. BREAKING: @egragcrypto just dropped a BOMB on #XRP History repeating? Move 1 Move 2 = Liftoff Current Price: $2.16 Targets: $10.7 • $18 • $27 • $55+ This chart screams: MOON VERY SOON pic.twitter.com/YJ81J82WyF — Amonyx (@amonbuy) June 2, 2025 Egrag is known for his meticulous analysis of fractals, repeating historical patterns in price movements, and this latest call is no exception. By overlaying past price behaviors on the current chart, he suggests that XRP is mimicking a previous cycle that led to a significant bull run. If past patterns hold, the potential targets are remarkable: $10.70, followed by $18, $27, and possibly surging to $55 or beyond. Fueling the Momentum: Broader Market Context This bullish outlook does not exist in a vacuum. Ripple’s expanding partnerships with major financial institutions and central banks globally continue to strengthen the fundamental case for XRP as a cross-border settlement asset. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Moreover, the broader altcoin market has shown signs of recovery, with Bitcoin and Ethereum breaking through key resistance levels in recent weeks. As capital flows back into high-cap potential tokens, XRP’s technical setup makes it a prime candidate for explosive gains, precisely the scenario Egrag Crypto’s chart is spotlighting. Community Buzz and Sentiment Amonyx’s amplification of Egrag’s analysis has further ignited enthusiasm on X, where the XRP Army, the token’s devoted community, is known for passionately driving narratives and market sentiment. Comments under Amonyx’s post are filled with rocket emojis, moon references, and declarations of unwavering belief in XRP’s potential. Still, as always in crypto, caution is advised. Although technical patterns provide useful insights, markets are vulnerable to various unpredictable influences, including macroeconomic changes and unexpected regulatory decisions.. Yet, for now, the excitement is palpable, and Egrag Crypto’s latest projection has given the XRP faithful a fresh jolt of optimism.

2025-06-02T09:56:28,"Best Crypto to Buy Now As Leverage Traders Get Rekt By Price Volatility","The crypto market just witnessed another violent shakeout—Bitcoin briefly slipped under the $104,000 mark, triggering over $688 million in long liquidations. It was the largest wipeout since February, with nearly 90% of losses stemming from traders betting on the upside. Major futures positions on BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE were forcibly closed as cascading liquidations kicked in across exchanges. One headline-grabbing casualty was James Wynn, a whale known for aggressive bets, who reportedly lost nearly all his capital after a $1.25 billion BTC long backfired. As events like this unfold, many investors are starting to view traditional trading as a high-risk arena and are now leaning toward presales—where the entry cost is low and the upside potential remains significant, especially during launches. Volatility Wrecks Traders as Attention Shifts to High-Upside Presales The latest correction has again exposed the vulnerability of leveraged traders. Bitcoin’s sharp retracement below $104,000 erased nearly $700 million in open long positions. This wasn’t a quiet correction—it was a market-wide flush. The effects rippled across Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin, all posting significant single-day losses. Futures trading, which had seen renewed enthusiasm with open interest surging 51% since April, became the center of collapse. Traders who overexposed themselves to bullish derivatives faced rapid forced closures, amplifying the sell-off. Presales offer a middle ground between passive investing and active trading. They retain the upside that excites traders but without the exposure to intraday volatility. I’ll run it back, I always doAnd I’ll enjoy doing itI like playing the gameI like the swingsMoney is all about mindsetAt the end of the day, I’m still richer than 99.9% of CT brokiesI took a large and calculated bet at making billions, most of you wouldn’t dare,… — James Wynn (@JamesWynnReal) May 31, 2025 Among the most dramatic losses was that of James Wynn, whose on-chain trading activity had earned both praise and scrutiny. Starting with just $4,000, he built up an astonishing $100+ million portfolio through daring long positions on BTC and various tokens. But during the tariff-induced drop, Wynn entered an enormous $1.25 billion long on Bitcoin. As the price slid below $105,000, the position unraveled catastrophically. Fees and slippage contributed to a $37 million loss in a single trade. In the following days, Wynn attempted to recover using high-risk memecoin positions across PEPE, TRUMP, SUI, and others. These too were liquidated as volatility persisted. What remained in his account: $23. Wynn’s story has become more than just drama—it’s now a case study. In forums, his name trends not with admiration, but as a warning. This has led to a change in mindset. While traditional trading allows fast gains, it also demands constant risk tolerance. Investors who were drawn to trading for potential returns are now gravitating toward presales—projects that launch with micro market caps and the possibility of a 10x to 100x increase. These tokens often begin at fractions of a cent, and unlike active trading, they require no timing precision or leverage to deliver gains. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Presales That Could 10x or More SUBBD As traditional trading continues to burn high-leverage players, a shift is happening toward presales that combine utility with long-term viability. SUBBD is drawing attention for precisely that reason. Instead of relying on speculative hype, it introduces a model that reshapes how content creators monetize their work. At its foundation is a decentralized protocol that lets creators issue their own branded tokens directly to supporters, bypassing outdated subscription models and eliminating platform fees that typically drain creator income. The $SUBBD token serves both creators and their communities. For users, it’s a gateway to exclusive content, early drops, private communities, and even voting rights on creator-driven proposals. For creators, it’s a means to lock in recurring income without surrendering control to centralized platforms. It removes the instability associated with ad-driven monetization and reimagines patronage as an investment-based ecosystem. What makes SUBBD relevant right now is its contrast with speculative derivatives. Instead of chasing volatility, it supports a system where holders are incentivized through staking, creator growth, and demand-driven appreciation. Projects like this are gaining traction because they align with the current investor mood—less exposure to sudden crashes, more focus on potential that compounds over time. With presale access offering early exposure to a fixed token supply and an ecosystem that thrives on creator output, SUBBD appeals to those who still seek aggressive upside but prefer not to live on the edge of liquidation. It answers volatility not with avoidance, but with real infrastructure for sustainable token growth. Snorter When traders like James Wynn lose millions overnight, it brings renewed attention to tools that simplify entry into crypto while avoiding such destructive risk. Snorter is a presale project building precisely in that direction—an automated trading assistant designed for on-chain users who want access to market opportunities without drowning in technical complexity or leverage. Snorter functions as a Telegram-integrated bot that scans for newly launched tokens, verifies contract safety, and even provides gas-efficient sniping features—all within a few taps. Built to streamline Solana-based token trading, it gives retail users the type of agility typically reserved for more seasoned, manually active traders. The value here is access, not leverage. But it’s not just a shortcut to memecoin speculation. Snorter has laid out a plan for tiered access models, a staking-backed subscription utility, and a revenue-sharing structure for early holders of its $SNORT token. Every time a trade is routed through Snorter, protocol fees are distributed to token holders, creating a system that rewards usage rather than speculation. In the wake of cascading market liquidations, tools like this gain weight. They don’t ask users to predict tops or bottoms. Instead, they offer infrastructure to improve trade execution, mitigate risks, and find alpha without depending on futures markets. As volatility shakes the confidence of many, Snorter’s presale represents a calculated pivot toward smarter trading—not riskier one. It’s utility-first, trader-friendly, and designed to reward participation without forcing exposure to the kind of positions that erased fortunes this week. Solaxy With risk tolerance shaken and derivatives growing more unpredictable, investor attention is turning to projects grounded in infrastructure and purpose. Solaxy is one of the few current presales combining both, offering an energy-efficient Layer 2 designed for cross-chain functionality between Ethereum and Solana. At a time when whales are taking profits and traders are sidelined, Solaxy offers a way to align with foundational tech rather than market timing. What sets Solaxy apart is its lightweight validation system. Rather than duplicating heavy chain activity, Solaxy enables smart contract execution with minimal fees and high throughput. This opens up room for DeFi tools, gaming, and staking to function with real-time efficiency and reduced cost. The native token, SOLX, carries the protocol's utility—used for staking, transaction fees, and node incentivization. It’s also how users participate in governance, with plans for decentralized upgrades and cross-chain bridges decided directly through token votes. During the recent market downturn, networks with high gas fees and slower transaction speeds became a source of frustration for developers and users alike. Solaxy’s presale stands out as a response to that tension. Rather than launching into the chaos of an exchange listing, it begins with early incentives, liquidity support, and time to build a network effect without being disrupted by volatility—a thought shared by ClayBro , a popular creator who covered the project on his YouTube channel. Presales like Solaxy are finding traction not because they promise hype, but because they address structural gaps left unfilled by overleveraged projects. For those pivoting from reactive trading toward long-term protocol exposure, Solaxy offers a calm and calculated entry. Best Wallet Token As liquidations unsettle even the most experienced traders, a growing number are shifting their attention toward ecosystems that offer stability, autonomy, and passive growth—all of which define Best Wallet’s vision. Best Wallet Token’s main product is a non-custodial, multi-chain crypto wallet, but it’s far more than just a place to store tokens. It’s a financial toolset, equipped for staking, presale access, portfolio tracking, and on-chain trading—all wrapped into one mobile-first platform. The native token, BEST, acts as a value driver across this ecosystem. It unlocks staking rewards, early access to exclusive token launches via the wallet’s built-in presale aggregator, and future governance participation as the platform moves toward full decentralization. Holders also benefit from performance-based airdrops and trading incentives built directly into the wallet UI, giving BEST utility far beyond mere speculation. In a market where traders are being wiped out chasing fast returns, Best Wallet offers an alternative flow of rewards—one tied to usage, staking, and steady growth. It’s no surprise that attention is turning to it now. It operates quietly in the background, while traders reeling from lost leverage begin valuing reliability. What makes its presale timely is the current user sentiment: less tolerance for noise, more interest in products with real demand. The wallet already supports 60+ chains, shows cross-chain compatibility, and is built with institutional-grade encryption. This is not a bet on market sentiment—it’s a platform that continues to gain traction no matter which way the charts move. BTC Bull For traders who built fortunes overnight and lost them just as fast, BTC Bull is starting to look like a much-needed change of pace. It doesn’t rely on rapid scalping or high-risk plays. Instead, it rewards conviction—offering token airdrops tied to Bitcoin milestones and incentivizing users for simply staying engaged as BTC continues its long-term climb. The project is rooted in a philosophy that reflects the original ethos of Bitcoin: community-driven value backed by transparent incentives. With every major price threshold BTC crosses—$110k, $120k, and beyond—holders of BTC Bull’s native token receive milestone-based rewards, while a portion of tokens are burned, ensuring a deflationary supply curve. This system appeals to those who understand timing the market often fails, but being present during key moments matters more. Bitcoin hit $111K. 🐂🔥The first BTCBULL burn milestone is getting closer. pic.twitter.com/1iHi376vQl — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) May 22, 2025 It’s not just about passive rewards, though. BTC Bull also incorporates a structured staking model with tiered APY based on holding behavior. The longer tokens are staked, the greater the returns, creating a rhythm of engagement rather than speculative chaos. While James Wynn’s story is a cautionary tale of what happens when risk goes unchecked, BTC Bull presents a counterbalance: consistent growth built around the strongest asset in crypto. Its presale offers access before token burns and airdrop triggers come into play. For investors looking to stay exposed to Bitcoin’s rise without dancing around leverage, BTC Bull opens up that path—with clarity, structure, and none of the turbulence that took down traders last week. Conclusion For those rethinking their strategy after a tricky week in the markets, presales offer a path that doesn’t demand constant chart-watching or exposure to high-stakes trades. With lower initial valuations and clear utility baked in from the start, these early-stage opportunities present a chance to enter projects before the rest of the market catches on.

2025-06-02T09:52:08,"Analysts caution market volatility as fresh rumors of Fed Chair Jerome Powell exit spread","Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has come under renewed public pressure from President Donald Trump. Rumors started making the rounds on X on June 1, 2025, that Powell was stepping down and the interest rates would soon be cut. However, there has been no official confirmation, and many market analysts are waving off the claims as unfounded. This rumor, cast widely on social platform X on June 1, 2025, stated that Powell was stepping down and the interest rates would soon be cut. However, there has been no official confirmation, and many market analysts are waving off the claims as unfounded. Powel to resign tomorrow 🚨 I see lots of these nonsense posts on CT today Let me tell you 1st – it’s not gonna happen 2nd – if that happened, the markets would dump significantly ⚡️ Why? Trust in dollar and US economy would decrease instantly Just remember what happened… pic.twitter.com/1U2wEVNFE5 — Lana Queen (@Lana_Queen7) June 1, 2025 Polymarket traders seemed equally unimpressed. Despite the rumor, the odds on the prediction market for the question ‘Will Trump remove Jerome Powell in 2025?’ stayed steady at 14%, indicating no increase in confidence in the rumor. Analysts said this skepticism stemmed from a lack of institutional support and a constitutional limit to dismissing the Fed chair. Trump met with Powell on Thursday at the White House, their first sit down since the president’s return to office. The Fed statement said Powell did not appear to shift the policy direction and reiterated that monetary decisions would remain strictly data-dependent. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that meeting, saying that Trump pressed Powell to cut interest rates, citing his country’s economic disadvantage compared to countries like China. Trump has made no secret that he is frustrated with the Fed chair. In April, he tweeted on Truth Social that Powell’s “termination cannot come fast enough.” He later walked that back, saying he “had no intention” of firing him. The Supreme Court has weighed in as well, making it quite clear that Trump does not have the power to dismiss the Fed chair before his term ends in 2026. Fed independence tested as pressure builds Trump has softened the tone in recent days, telling an interviewer that he’s not planning to fire Powell but that he needs to be replaced soon. Trump noted, however, that Powell’s term ends only in a very short period in 2026. However, uncertainty has reignited fears that the Fed is not truly independent. The latest threats from Trump have come after periods of volatility. In one high-profile case, his social media comments sparked more than a few days of market mayhem in April. Interest rates have remained at 4.25% to 4.50% at the central bank’s three latest meetings. Powell has repeatedly refused to bow to political influence and insisted decisions must follow macroeconomic data, not presidential preferences. Powell said in his public remarks that he has not asked for a meeting with any US president and that the central bank must remain independent. A recent Supreme Court ruling allowing Trump to keep some of his dismissed independent agency employees off the job also had some indirect implications, some legal analysts noted. However, the court noted that the deal does not extend to the Federal Reserve, which the court called a uniquely structured body that behaved independently in the past. Bitcoin holds strong amid political uncertainty Bitcoin decoupled from traditional market movements as political tensions rise. Bitcoin traded above $105,000 despite Wall Street’s decline and the U.S. dollar falling to a three-year low. CryptoQuant data suggests that the current rally is getting close to a possible short-term top. The trend remains bullish, but further political uncertainty, which could see volatility spike, may prompt profit-taking. Trump appointed Powell in 2018, and his current term is until May 2026. While he has kept silent on Trump’s personal attacks, he has repeatedly stuck to the Fed’s familiar message of steady prices and maximum employment. He’s also said he did not ask to see any sitting president when he was in office. Powell met the president twice during Trump’s first term—once on his birthday and again later that year. The latest meeting was the first in-person face-to-face exchange during Trump’s second term, which followed months of public pressure.

2025-06-02T09:50:26,"XChat Security Fortress: Elon Musk Unveils End-to-End Encryption and Bitcoin-Style Features on X","BitcoinWorld XChat Security Fortress: Elon Musk Unveils End-to-End Encryption and Bitcoin-Style Features on X In a significant move for the social media landscape, Elon Musk X has announced the rollout of X’s new messaging feature, dubbed XChat. This isn’t just another chat function; according to Musk, it’s launching with robust security measures designed to protect user conversations, including end-to-end security and what he described as “Bitcoin-style encryption.” For anyone concerned about Messaging App Privacy in the digital age, this announcement from the X platform leadership is certainly attention-grabbing. What is XChat and Why is End-to-End Encryption Crucial? XChat represents X’s effort to build a comprehensive messaging system directly into the social media platform. While X (formerly Twitter) has had direct messages (DMs) for years, this new feature appears to be a significant upgrade, aiming to compete with dedicated messaging apps. At the heart of modern secure messaging is End-to-End Encryption (E2EE). This is a method of secure communication that prevents third parties from reading data while it’s being transferred from one point to another. In essence, only the sender and the intended recipient can read the message. Even the service provider facilitating the communication cannot access the content. Think of it like sending a message in a locked box that only you and your friend have the key to. The postal service (the messaging platform) can carry the box, but they can’t open it to read the message inside. This is fundamentally different from traditional communication methods where the service provider (like an email provider) often has access to the content. Why is E2EE crucial for Messaging App Privacy ? Protects Against Snooping: It makes it incredibly difficult for hackers, governments, or even the platform itself to intercept and read private conversations. Enhances Trust: Users can communicate sensitive information with greater confidence, knowing their messages are for their eyes only. Prevents Data Breaches: If the platform’s servers are compromised, the encrypted message content remains unreadable to the attackers. The inclusion of E2EE in XChat is a fundamental step towards positioning it as a secure communication tool, addressing a critical user need in today’s digital environment. Decoding the “ Bitcoin-Style Encryption ” Claim Perhaps the most intriguing part of Musk’s announcement was the mention of “ Bitcoin-Style Encryption .” It’s important to clarify what this likely means in the context of a messaging app, as it doesn’t imply XChat messages are being stored on the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin uses several cryptographic principles, primarily public-key cryptography (also known as asymmetric encryption) for securing transactions and verifying ownership. It also relies on cryptographic hashing and digital signatures. When Musk refers to “Bitcoin-style encryption” for XChat Security , he is likely referencing the application of similar robust cryptographic principles, specifically public-key cryptography, within the messaging protocol. Here’s how this might manifest: Public-Key Cryptography: Like Bitcoin uses public and private keys for sending/receiving funds securely, XChat likely uses key pairs for users. Your public key can be shared with others so they can encrypt messages only you (with your private key) can decrypt. This is standard for E2EE protocols (like Signal’s protocol, which WhatsApp and others use). Identity Verification: Similar to how Bitcoin transactions are cryptographically signed to prove they come from the owner of the private key, XChat might use digital signatures to verify the authenticity of messages and the identities of participants in a conversation. Secure Key Exchange: A critical part of E2EE is securely exchanging the keys used to encrypt and decrypt messages. Protocols often use methods inspired by cryptographic principles to ensure this exchange is secure and not vulnerable to interception. It’s less likely to mean features directly tied to the blockchain’s immutability or distributed ledger aspects, as XChat is a centralized service run by X. The term is more likely intended to evoke a sense of robust, cryptographically sound security akin to the foundational principles that make Bitcoin transactions secure, rather than integrating with the Bitcoin network itself. Beyond Encryption: Features Enhancing XChat Security and Usability Beyond the core E2EE and “Bitcoin-style” claims, Elon Musk X highlighted several other features rolling out with XChat that contribute to its functionality and potential Messaging App Privacy : End-to-End Security: While often used interchangeably with E2EE, this might imply a broader security posture encompassing not just message content but also protection against metadata leaks or other vulnerabilities within the app itself. Vanishing Messages: This popular feature allows users to set messages to automatically delete after a specified time period. This adds an extra layer of privacy, ensuring sensitive information doesn’t persist indefinitely in chat logs. It’s a common feature in secure messaging apps and enhances user control over their digital footprint. Audio and Video Calling: Integrating secure voice and video communication within the encrypted framework is crucial for a modern messaging app. Ensuring these calls are also end-to-end encrypted provides a private channel for real-time conversations. Support for All File Types: Allowing users to share any type of file (documents, photos, videos, etc.) securely within the encrypted chat environment adds significant utility. This means sensitive documents can potentially be shared without leaving the secure, encrypted channel. These features, combined with the core encryption, aim to make XChat a versatile and secure communication tool for users on the X platform. Under the Hood: Rust and a New Architecture The announcement also mentioned that the system is built using Rust and introduces a completely new architecture. For those interested in the technical underpinnings, this is noteworthy: Rust: Rust is a programming language known for its focus on memory safety and performance. Building a critical security feature like an encrypted messaging system in Rust can help mitigate common vulnerabilities (like buffer overflows) that plague languages without strong memory safety guarantees. This choice suggests a focus on building a stable and secure foundation for XChat. Completely New Architecture: This implies XChat isn’t just an overlay on the old DM system but a fundamental redesign. A new architecture can be optimized for scalability, speed, and crucially, security from the ground up. This allows developers to implement modern encryption protocols and security best practices more effectively than trying to retrofit them into an older system. These technical decisions highlight an apparent commitment to building a robust and secure messaging platform, which is essential for gaining user trust in the realm of Messaging App Privacy . Benefits and Challenges for XChat Security The proposed features offer clear benefits: Enhanced User Privacy: E2EE and vanishing messages significantly improve privacy. Increased Security: Robust encryption protects against interception. Versatile Communication: File sharing, audio/video calls add functionality within a secure channel. Potential for Trust: If implemented correctly, these features could build trust with users concerned about their data. However, challenges exist: Implementation Accuracy: E2EE is complex; flaws in implementation can render it ineffective. The details of the “Bitcoin-style” aspects need clear technical explanation. Trust Deficit: Given past controversies surrounding X and its data policies, building user trust in a new, centralized messaging service with strong privacy claims might be an uphill battle for Elon Musk X . Regulatory Pressure: Strong E2EE often faces pressure from governments seeking access to communications for law enforcement or national security purposes. User Adoption: Competing with established secure messaging apps requires not just features but a proven track record and network effect. Comparing XChat’s Vision to Existing Secure Messaging Apps How does XChat’s announced feature set stack up against leaders in secure messaging? Feature XChat (Announced) Signal Telegram WhatsApp End-to-End Encryption Yes (Rolling Out) Yes (Default for all messages) Yes (For Secret Chats only) Yes (Default for all messages) “Bitcoin-Style” Encryption Claimed (Likely refers to crypto principles) Uses advanced cryptographic protocols Uses advanced cryptographic protocols Uses Signal Protocol Vanishing Messages Yes Yes Yes Yes Audio/Video Calls (E2EE) Yes Yes Yes (Group calls E2EE status varies) Yes Support for All File Types Yes Yes Yes Yes (with size limits) Underlying Tech Mentioned Rust, New Architecture Open Source, Signal Protocol Custom Protocol (MTProto) Signal Protocol Based on the announcement, XChat aims to offer a feature set comparable to other secure messaging apps, particularly regarding E2EE and related privacy features. The key differentiator and point of scrutiny will be the technical implementation and the specifics behind the “Bitcoin-style” claim. What Actionable Insights Can Users Take? For users of X and those interested in secure communication: Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from X regarding the technical details of XChat’s encryption implementation. Look for whitepapers or technical documentation. Verify Claims: Skepticism is healthy in security. Wait for independent security audits or expert analysis of the XChat protocol once it’s fully rolled out. Understand E2EE: Educate yourself on how E2EE works and its limitations. Remember that E2EE protects message content, but metadata (who you talked to, when) might still be accessible to the platform. Consider Alternatives: If Messaging App Privacy is paramount, compare XChat’s features and trust model with established, audited E2EE apps like Signal. Be Mindful of Centralization: XChat is a centralized service. While E2EE protects message content, the platform operator still controls the service, user accounts, and potentially metadata. Conclusion: A Bold Step for XChat Security ? Elon Musk X ‘s announcement of XChat with End-to-End Encryption and “ Bitcoin-Style Encryption ” is a bold statement about X’s ambitions in the secure messaging space. By promising robust privacy features, support for all file types, vanishing messages, and secure calls, XChat aims to be a compelling option for users seeking more private communication within the X ecosystem. The technical choices, like building with Rust and a new architecture, suggest a serious effort to create a secure and performant system. However, the success and trustworthiness of XChat will ultimately depend on the transparency of its implementation, the verifiability of its security claims (especially the “Bitcoin-style” aspect), and X’s overall commitment to user privacy in practice. For users prioritizing Messaging App Privacy , XChat enters a competitive landscape, and its ability to build and maintain trust will be its greatest challenge.

2025-06-02T09:45:19,"IG Group to Let UK Retail Investors Trade BTC, ETH, XRP Directly","Key Takeaways: IG Group will let UK retail investors trade BTC, ETH, XRP, and 35 other tokens. The launch comes as UK crypto ownership grows and new regulations take shape. From 2026, UK crypto firms must report detailed customer data on all trades. UK-listed trading firm IG Group will become the first company on the London Stock Exchange to allow retail investors to buy and sell individual cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP), as part of a new digital assets service. “This is a major milestone in the UK’s crypto journey,” Michael Healy, managing director of IG’s UK business, told The Times . “Customer demand is reaching a tipping point.” Under the new offering, IG retail clients will be able to trade 38 cryptocurrencies through a partnership with Uphold, a digital assets platform. IG Group to Offer BTC, ETH, XRP, and Memecoins The selection will include popular tokens such as BTC, ETH, and XRP, as well as smaller assets like memecoin Dogwifhat. Custody of the assets will be provided by Uphold. However, holdings will not be protected under the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme. The expansion moves IG beyond its traditional core of leveraged trading and stockbroking. It also positions the FTSE 250 firm as a more trusted alternative to existing UK-based crypto services, such as Revolut, which is not listed. Being a listed company helps to “bolster client trust,” Healy said. Interest in crypto among UK consumers is rising. Last year, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) estimated that 12% of UK adults now own cryptocurrency — up from just 4.4% in 2021. The move comes as the UK government finalizes new crypto regulations, aimed at providing long-awaited clarity and addressing risks in the market. However, regulators remain cautious. The FCA has repeatedly warned retail investors that cryptocurrencies lack inherent value and carry high volatility risks. In 2022, the collapse of FTX and the conviction of its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, further rattled the sector. Despite these concerns, institutional interest in crypto is growing. Hedge funds and other professional investors have moved into the space in recent years, while political winds may also be shifting. In the US, President Trump has positioned himself as a crypto supporter, raising hopes for a friendlier regulatory stance. UK to Enforce Mandatory Crypto Trade Reporting The UK will require crypto firms to collect and report detailed customer information on every trade and transfer starting January 1, 2026, as part of a sweeping effort to strengthen tax compliance and oversight in the digital asset sector. According to a recent statement from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the new rules will mandate that platforms record full names, home addresses, and tax identification numbers for all users. Each transaction must also be logged with specifics such as the cryptocurrency used and the amount transferred. The reporting obligation extends beyond individual users to include companies, trusts, and charities engaged in crypto activity. Firms that fail to comply or submit inaccurate data may face penalties of up to £300 ($398) per user.

2025-06-02T09:40:22,"Stablecoins US Dollar: Scaramucci Reveals Surprising Way Crypto Strengthens Reserve Currency Role","BitcoinWorld Stablecoins US Dollar: Scaramucci Reveals Surprising Way Crypto Strengthens Reserve Currency Role Could a digital asset, often viewed with skepticism by traditional finance, actually be a secret weapon for the world’s leading currency? That’s the fascinating perspective recently shared by SkyBridge Capital founder, Anthony Scaramucci. He argues that Stablecoins US Dollar pegged assets are not a threat, but rather a reinforcement of the greenback’s global dominance. This viewpoint challenges the common narrative and opens up an important conversation about the evolving relationship between traditional finance and the crypto world. Stablecoins US Dollar: A Digital Extension? Anthony Scaramucci took to social media platform X to address a pertinent question: Does the U.S. President have a duty to protect the dollar’s value, and do cryptocurrencies, including the often-volatile memecoins, pose a risk to this value? His response was clear and insightful, suggesting that stablecoins, specifically those pegged to the U.S. dollar, actually serve to bolster the dollar’s strength and its critical role as the global reserve currency. But how exactly do these digital tokens achieve this? At their core, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically by being pegged 1:1 with a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. This stability is crucial because it bridges the gap between the volatile crypto market and the traditional financial system. When someone holds a USD-pegged stablecoin like USDT or USDC, they are essentially holding a digital representation of a U.S. dollar claim. This increases the overall demand and utility for the U.S. dollar in the digital economy. How Stablecoins Bolster the Dollar: Increased Accessibility: Stablecoins make the U.S. dollar easily transferable and accessible globally, 24/7, without relying on traditional banking hours or infrastructure. Global Trading Pairs: A vast majority of cryptocurrency trading pairs involve a USD-pegged stablecoin. This means that to participate in the crypto market, traders often need to acquire and hold these dollar-denominated digital assets. Remittance and Payments: Stablecoins offer a faster and cheaper way to send value across borders compared to traditional methods, often denominated in USD, further promoting its use internationally. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): The burgeoning DeFi ecosystem heavily relies on stablecoins for lending, borrowing, and trading. This creates significant demand for USD-pegged assets within this innovative financial space. US Dollar Reserve Currency: Why Stablecoins Matter The US Dollar Reserve Currency status is a cornerstone of American economic power. It means that governments and institutions worldwide hold dollars as a primary reserve asset and use it for international trade and finance. This status provides significant advantages to the U.S., including lower borrowing costs and greater influence in global financial affairs. For decades, this reserve status has been maintained through traditional banking channels, government bonds, and international agreements. However, as the global economy becomes increasingly digitized, the mechanisms by which currencies maintain relevance are also evolving. Stablecoins, by extending the reach and usability of the U.S. dollar into the digital realm, can be seen as a modern tool for reinforcing this status. Stablecoins vs. Other Digital Currencies: It’s important to distinguish USD-pegged stablecoins from other digital currencies like Bitcoin or central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Feature USD-Pegged Stablecoin Bitcoin (BTC) Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Value Stability Pegged to USD (aims for stability) Highly Volatile Pegged to Fiat Currency (aims for stability) Issuance Private companies/entities Decentralized mining Central Bank Purpose Bridge crypto/fiat, payments, trading, DeFi Store of value, speculative asset, peer-to-peer cash Digital form of fiat currency, potentially for payments, reserves Impact on USD Increases digital demand/utility Alternative asset (potential competition) Direct digital form of USD (if US issues one) While Bitcoin offers an alternative store of value outside the traditional system, and CBDCs represent a potential government-issued digital dollar, stablecoins offer a way for the *existing* U.S. dollar to thrive in the digital economy, driven by private innovation and market demand. Anthony Scaramucci: A Voice from Traditional Finance Why does Anthony Scaramucci ‘s opinion carry weight in this discussion? As the founder of SkyBridge Capital, a global investment firm, Scaramucci is a figure deeply rooted in traditional finance who has also embraced the potential of digital assets. SkyBridge has invested significantly in the crypto space, including Bitcoin funds. His perspective, therefore, comes from someone who understands both the mechanics of global finance and the disruptive potential of cryptocurrencies. His view that stablecoins are beneficial for the dollar contrasts with some policymakers who see *all* forms of crypto as potentially undermining sovereign currencies. Scaramucci’s argument is nuanced: while speculative assets like memecoins might be volatile and pose different questions, stablecoins, by their very design and utility, can act as digital ambassadors for the U.S. dollar on the global stage. Crypto and USD: Is it Conflict or Coexistence? The relationship between Crypto and USD is complex and often debated. Critics argue that the rise of decentralized cryptocurrencies could lead people to abandon fiat currencies, including the dollar. They point to concerns about illicit finance, tax evasion, and the potential for capital flight. However, Scaramucci’s point, focused specifically on stablecoins, highlights a different dynamic. Instead of competing directly as a store of value or medium of exchange in the same way Bitcoin might, USD-pegged stablecoins act more like digital infrastructure built *on top of* the dollar. They facilitate transactions and activities that might not otherwise happen as easily or efficiently using traditional dollar rails, thereby increasing the dollar’s footprint in the digital world. Even memecoins, while speculative and often lacking fundamental value, are typically traded against stablecoins (like USDT or USDC). This indirect link means that even participation in the most speculative corners of the crypto market often involves the use of a dollar-denominated digital asset, further embedding the dollar within the crypto ecosystem. Exploring Stablecoin Benefits Beyond the USD Link While their peg to the U.S. dollar is their defining characteristic in this context, it’s worth exploring other Stablecoin Benefits that contribute to their growing adoption and, consequently, their role in promoting the dollar digitally: Speed and Cost: Transactions using stablecoins on blockchain networks are typically much faster and cheaper than international wire transfers. Programmability: Stablecoins can be used in smart contracts, enabling automated financial operations like escrow, payroll, or complex derivatives in DeFi. Financial Inclusion: For individuals and businesses in regions with unstable local currencies or limited access to traditional banking, USD-pegged stablecoins offer a relatively stable digital store of value and medium of exchange. Transparency: Transactions are recorded on public blockchains, offering a degree of transparency (though privacy varies) not always present in traditional systems. These advantages make USD-pegged stablecoins attractive for a wide range of uses, from trading and yield farming to cross-border payments and online commerce, all of which increase the digital utility of the U.S. dollar. The National Debt Context Scaramucci also touched upon the national debt, noting that while addressing it is possible, it’s unlikely with the current political climate in Washington, D.C. While seemingly separate, this point adds context to the broader economic discussion. A strong U.S. dollar, potentially bolstered by its digital presence via stablecoins, can help manage the burden of national debt by maintaining confidence in U.S. assets and potentially attracting foreign investment. However, Scaramucci’s skepticism highlights the significant fiscal challenges the U.S. faces, which stablecoins alone cannot solve. Challenges and the Path Forward Despite the potential benefits, the stablecoin landscape is not without challenges. Regulatory uncertainty remains a major hurdle. Policymakers are grappling with how to regulate stablecoin issuers to ensure reserves are adequately backed and consumer protection is in place. The collapse of algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) in 2022 served as a stark reminder of the risks associated with poorly designed or unbacked stablecoins. Ensuring the stability and integrity of USD-pegged stablecoins is paramount for them to truly act as reliable digital extensions of the dollar. This requires clear regulation, robust auditing of reserves, and technological resilience. Conclusion: A Surprising Alliance? Anthony Scaramucci’s remarks offer a compelling perspective: far from undermining the U.S. dollar, stablecoins, particularly those pegged to the greenback, can act as powerful digital tools that extend its reach, utility, and ultimately, reinforce its status as the dominant global reserve currency. By providing a stable, accessible, and efficient digital form of the dollar, stablecoins integrate the traditional financial powerhouse with the innovative world of blockchain and cryptocurrency. While challenges, especially regulatory ones, need to be addressed, the potential for a symbiotic relationship between stablecoins and the U.S. dollar reserve currency role is significant. Scaramucci’s view encourages us to look beyond the surface volatility of the crypto market and recognize how certain innovations within it might actually serve to strengthen the foundations of the traditional financial system.

2025-06-02T09:40:08,"Meta Shareholders Shut Down Push for Bitcoin Treasury","The initiative was led by Bitcoin advocate Ethan Peck, who argued for using a portion of Meta’s $72 billion cash reserves to hedge against inflation. However, it is believed that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's controlling stake ensured the proposal’s defeat. Despite this, interest in corporate Bitcoin holdings is still rising globally. Meanwhile, Meta is still laser focused on artificial intelligence and defense applications. The company recently partnered with defense firm Anduril to develop AI-driven AR gear for US soldiers, repurposing metaverse technologies for military use. On the other hand, Meta’s AI research also faces internal struggles, with key talent departing and its Llama models trailing competitors. AI chief Yann LeCun is calling for a paradigm shift when it comes to training methods to build more intelligent systems. Bitcoin Proposal Crushed in Meta Vote Meta shareholders decisively voted against a proposal to explore adding Bitcoin to the tech giant’s balance sheet. The “Bitcoin treasury assessment” proposal was submitted earlier this year by Bitcoin advocate Ethan Peck, but it received just 3.92 million votes in favor. This accounts for about 0.08% of the total votes. Nearly 5 billion shareholders rejected the measure, according to a May 28 regulatory filing . It is assumed that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who controls 61% of the company's voting power, voted against the proposal, which effectively sealed its defeat. (Source: SEC ) Peck’s proposal argued that a portion of Meta’s $72 billion in cash and cash equivalents should be converted into Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. In his supporting statement, Peck claimed that 28% of Meta’s total assets are “consistently diminishing shareholder value” due to currency debasement and bond yields that fail to outpace inflation. He also pointed to BlackRock’s stance that a 2% allocation into Bitcoin is considered reasonable. Peck is the Bitcoin director at Strive, and submitted the proposal on behalf of his family’s Meta shares. He previously made similar pitches to Microsoft and Amazon. Microsoft shareholders ultimately rejected the idea in December, while Amazon investors are still due to vote on a similar proposal. Despite these high-profile rejections, corporate interest in Bitcoin is still gaining momentum. According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET , 116 publicly traded companies now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Some of the more recent entrants include GameStop and Swedish health tech firm H100, both of which made their first Bitcoin purchases last month. Holders of Bitcoin (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.net ) Strategy is still the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 580,250 BTC worth approximately $60.9 billion. Other major holders include Marathon Digital Holdings and Tesla, each with over $1 billion in Bitcoin holdings. For now, the stark rejection at Meta suggests that shareholder appetite for crypto diversification is limited among large-cap tech firms, even as more companies globally are beginning to see Bitcoin as a viable corporate reserve asset. Meta Steps Into Combat While Bitcoin may not be a top priority at Meta, AI certainly is. The social media giant recently partnered with defense contractor Anduril to create artificial intelligence-powered augmented and virtual reality gear for the US military. The main goal of the collaboration is to equip soldiers with advanced headsets that incorporate Anduril’s AI-driven Lattice command and control system. This platform aggregates and interprets data from thousands of sources to deliver real-time battlefield intelligence. According to Anduril, the gear will enhance soldiers' situational awareness and enable more intuitive control over autonomous systems. This will provide a new layer of immersion and decision-making capability during combat missions. The project is privately funded and forms part of the growing trend of repurposing consumer technologies for military applications. Meta has invested $40 billion into virtual and augmented reality technologies since pivoting to its metaverse ambitions in 2021, and is now leveraging its expertise in immersive tech for defense purposes. Anduril’s co-founder Palmer Luckey , who also founded Oculus VR, said the joint project is part of his vision to turn US troops into “technomancers” by using cutting-edge tech to dominate the battlefield. He revealed on X that their first public collaboration will be a system called EagleEye, which is intended to evolve into the Army’s next Soldier Borne Mission Command platform. This new partnership comes after Microsoft initially held a similar AR contract under the same military program using its HoloLens headset. However, Microsoft confirmed in February that Anduril took over the lead, though Microsoft will still provide cloud infrastructure. It is becoming clear that the ties between Silicon Valley and the US defense establishment are deepening. Last November, Meta revised its acceptable use policies to allow its Llama language models to be used in military and national security applications. Around the same time, Anthropic made its Claude AI models available to US defense agencies through Palantir’s AI platform, hosted on AWS. Meta’s AI Vision Diverges On the other hand, Meta’s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun is concerned that current artificial intelligence models fall short of truly replicating human intelligence, and suggested that a fundamental shift in training methods is required to close the gap. At the AI Action Summit in Paris earlier this year, LeCun shared four key traits that define intelligent behavior in animals and humans: understanding the physical world, having persistent memory, reasoning ability, and the capacity for hierarchical planning. He said that today’s large language models, which power popular AI chatbots, lack these essential capabilities and that simply adding new features to existing architectures isn’t enough. Instead, LeCun advocates for a much more sophisticated approach by using what he calls “world-based models,” which will enable AI systems to simulate actions and predict how the world would change as a result. He argues that these models should learn through abstraction, much like humans do, in order to operate in an unpredictable and complex physical environment. Meta started exploring new directions, including retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to enhance model outputs with external data, and its February release of V-JEPA, a non-generative model that learns by predicting missing parts of video sequences. Still, LeCun says the industry needs to move beyond pattern-matching and embrace deeper cognitive modeling. However, Meta is also grappling with internal challenges as its AI division experiences a talent drain . Business Insider reports that only three of the original 14 researchers who developed the company’s first Llama model remain after many moved to Mistral. The exodus took place amid a lukewarm response to Meta’s latest release, Llama 4, which struggled to keep pace with offerings from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. These competitors have rolled out models that are praised for more advanced reasoning and user experience. According to The Wall Street Journal, Meta also delayed the release of its next-generation Llama model, code-named “Behemoth.”",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9394/meta-shareholders-shut-down-push-for-bitcoin-treasury,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|AR","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-02T09:40:05,"UK-Listed Investments Platform IG Offers Spot Crypto Trading to Retail Customers","Investment platform IG (IGG) said it has begun offering crypto trading to retail investors, becoming the first publicly-listed firm in the U.K. to do so. This marks IG's first offering of crypto exposure through spot trading of bitcoin BTC, ether ETH and a range of smaller tokens. The company's crypto service has previously been confined to derivatives products in the form contracts for difference (CFD). IG has teamed up with U.S.-based crypto-focused fintech firm Uphold to build crypto trading into its existing platforms that customers currently use for dealing shares, FX, commodities and derivatives. This may demonstrate the increasing integration between traditional finance (TradFi) and digital assets that investors and traders now expect to see. The London-based firm's move also coincides with the ongoing development of the U.K.'s plans to establish a regulatory regime for the crypto industry. The government published two consultation papers in April on draft legislation for activities such as crypto trading and stablecoin issuance. IG shares are around 0.25% higher on the day at the time of writing, compared to the FTSE 100 index which is unchanged.

2025-06-02T09:35:20,"U.S Dollar to Slide Further This Summer, Bank of America Warns","Bank of America has warned that the U.S. dollar could be in for a rough summer, having already dropped sharply this year. The dollar index, which tracks the value of the U.S. dollar against major currencies, has dropped nearly 9% to 99.74 this year, as President Donald Trump's tariff war triggered a shift away from U.S. assets . Bank of America expects continued data-driven drubbing over the Summer. Weakness in the U.S. dollar is widely seen as positive for dollar-denominated assets, such as gold and bitcoin BTC. The global FX research team led by Athanasios Vamvakidis stated in a report to clients Friday that tariffs are more detrimental to the U.S. economy as the country trades more with the rest of the world than perhaps any other nation. The report acknowledged recent resilience in the U.S. economy and growth-supportive developments, such as President Donald Trump's tax cuts and the abandonment of extreme fiscal spending cuts, but stated that ""negatives dominate."" ""Policy uncertainty on multiple fronts remains. Companies may pause hiring and investment plans until there is greater clarity. In most scenarios, we see tariffs much higher than the starting point, with current levels being the minimum,"" the report said. It added that the market is reacting negatively to the loosening of fiscal policy at a time when debt levels are at record highs, leading to higher borrowing costs. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is unable to take significant action due to rising inflation expectations. ""Migration flows have collapsed. Demand increased in Q1 [front running] ahead of tariffs but may be about to fall,"" strategists noted, pointing to weakness in high-frequency indicators such as the ISM data and weekly Dallas Fed economic index. The weekly Dallas Fed economic index has resumed the downtrend following the brief spike in early April and hit the lowest since December, according to data source TradingView. ""Such high-frequency indicators tend to be very noisy but could still point to a slowdown of the economy in the coming months,"" strategists said.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/02/u-s-dollar-to-slide-further-this-summer-bank-of-america-warns,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|RESEARCH","Markets|Bank of America|Markets|Dollar|market analysis|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-02T09:33:29,"Big Week for Bitcoin: Key US Economic Data to Be Released This Week","The post Big Week for Bitcoin: Key US Economic Data to Be Released This Week appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market has been steady for the past two weeks, moving between $109,000 and $104,000 after reaching a new all-time high of $111,980. Even though Bitcoin had an 11% jump last month , the market is taking a break for now. As the new month begins, investors are turning their focus to important US economic reports that could affect the crypto market. Let’s see what these reports are! 2nd June: Fed Chair Jerome Powell Speech Today, June 2 , all eyes are on Jerome Powell, the head of the US Federal Reserve. He’ll speak in Washington at 1 pm, sharing his thoughts on how the economy is doing and what the Fed might do next with interest rates. His speech will likely influence market sentiment and could give clues on what lies ahead for Bitcoin. 3rd June: US Job Openings (JOLTS) On June 3, the latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) for April will be released. In March, job openings fell to 7.192 million, the lowest since September 2024. This came before the new tariffs announced by President Trump. Experts think these policies have slowed down hiring. If job openings keep falling, the Fed might consider lowering interest rates, which could boost Bitcoin. 4th June: ADP Non-Farm Employment Wednesday, June 4, will bring the ADP Non-Farm Employment report for May. In April, private companies added only 62,000 jobs, down sharply from 147,000 in March. Economists now expect 112,000 new jobs in May. If the figure falls short, it might show that the economy is slowing, which could boost Bitcoin as an alternative to the dollar. 5th June: Initial Jobless Claims Thursday, June 5, brings the weekly jobless claims report. For the week ending May 24, claims rose to 240,000, up from 226,000. This was the highest since November 2021, showing signs of a softer labor market. Renowned economists expect 232,000 claims for the week ending May 31. More claims could mean the Fed will try to support the economy, which might be good for Bitcoin. 6th June: Non-Farm Payrolls & Unemployment Rate Finally, June 6 will bring the Non-Farm Payrolls report and the unemployment rate. In April, 177,000 new jobs were added, keeping the unemployment rate steady at 4.2%. Economists now expect 130,000 new jobs in May. If job growth slows because of the tariffs, the Fed might change its approach.

2025-06-02T09:33:04,"Will Bitcoin (BTC) Lose Its Shine to Gold Again? Price Analysis","With Bitcoin (BTC) still losing ground after its surge up to the $112,000 all-time high, gold is currently breaking out of a bull flag. The two soundest money assets are interchanging as the go-to flight to safety, and it looks like it might be gold’s turn again. $BTC attempts breakout from falling wedge Source: TradingView In the short-term chart for $BTC might have just started looking up. The falling wedge chart pattern isn’t the most perfect, but if it is legitimate, a breakout could be taking place. If the bulls can now push the price up and beyond the $105,500 resistance, a return to more bullish price action could be the result. A failure to breakout could mean $BTC coming down to the $102,000 major support. $BTC cause for concern in weekly timeframe Source: TradingView The fly in the ointment for $BTC is the breakdown below the ascending trendline on the weekly timeframe which has just been confirmed. Add to this the cross down of the indicators in the Stochastic RSI, leaving plenty of cause for concern. On the positive side of things, the price is holding above the strong supports at $104,000 and $102,000. If this support can hold, and there is a strong surge, perhaps due to some catalyst, the price can quickly get back to the all-time high and turn the weekly Stochastic RSI indicators back around. Gold is staging a breakout Source: TradingView Meanwhile, the gold price is also staging a breakout. Since gold hit the all-time high on 22 April at $3,500, the price has chopped sideways and has formed a bull flag. Monday is witnessing the breakout of this flag. The measured move out of the flag is to around $3,700. BTC/XAU has started to reverse in favour of gold Source: TradingView The Bitcoin/Gold chart on the weekly timeframe is suggesting that it’s possibly time for gold to take back the reins from Bitcoin. The 38% rise for $BTC against gold foundered at the 32 ounce resistance, and this week’s candle falling below the ascending trendline is a sign that gold is going to come back into the limelight. The weekly Stochastic RSI is another factor in gold’s favour. The indicator lines look to be crossing back down, bringing upside price momentum on the side of gold. Looking ahead, what will be important is how far down this potential correction for $BTC against gold will go. If the correction goes below the previous swing low, this will signify that $BTC would be changing to a downtrend against gold. However, if BTC/XAU can hold the 25 ounce support and bounce from there, the trend would continue higher in Bitcoin’s favour. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-02T09:32:30,"Crypto Soared in May as Institutions, States, and Regulators Embrace Bitcoin: Ikigai's Kling","Travis Kling of Ikigai Asset Management shared his May highlights for bitcoin BTC and broader crypto ecosystem, underscoring the remarkable scale of institutional adoption throughout the month. May was a blockbuster month for the crypto sector, headlined by unprecedented institutional investment, key legal developments, and heightened adoption by both private and public entities. Bitcoin BTC reached new all-time highs of $112,000 as corporate giants like Strategy (MSTR) purchased $2.7 billion worth of BTC in four tranches, while BTC spot ETFs absorbed $5.2 billion in inflows reflecting rising mainstream demand. Companies such as Trump Media & Technology Group and Twenty One Capital joined the wave, committing billions collectively to bitcoin treasury strategies. Notably, David Bailey’s Nakamoto Holdings raised $710 million to pursue a similar strategy following a reverse merger. Public firms like SharpLink Gaming and VivoPower announced significant private placements to launch Ethereum and XRP treasury strategies, signaling diversification beyond Bitcoin. At the state level, New Hampshire and Arizona became the first to pass strategic bitcoin reserve bills, underlining growing political endorsement. Regulatory clarity advanced, with the GENIUS Stablecoin Bill moving forward in the Senate, the SEC confirming that staking isn’t a security, and the OCC affirming that U.S. banks can legally buy, sell, and custody Bitcoin. Coinbase’s $2.9 billion acquisition of Deribit strengthened its derivatives position, even amid a major user data breach. Kraken’s move to launch tokenized stocks on Solana and the SUI network’s $200 million Cetus protocol funding further showcased Web3 innovation. Meanwhile, international players like Japan’s Metaplanet and France’s “The Blockchain Group” raised hundreds of millions to build bitcoin positions. The Nasdaq rose 9%, just 4% off its own ATH, indicating strong risk appetite across markets. Stripe’s move to integrate stablecoin accounts capped off a month of acceleration, institutionalization, and structural maturation for crypto markets.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/02/crypto-soared-in-may-as-institutions-states-and-regulators-embrace-bitcoin-ikigais-kling,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION","Markets|Coinbase|Bitcoin|MicroStrategy|market analysis|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-02T09:29:15,"Analysts predict the prices of DOGE, RTX, LTC and PI if Bitcoin hits $200K in 2025","As Bitcoin continues to hit new record highs, the possibility that it could break $200k keeps rising. Should the king coin eventually surpass this landmark price, everyone knows the ripple would be felt across the entire crypto space. But how would it affect coins like Remittix (RTX) , Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC) and Pi Network (PI)? Remittix is heading to the moon Remittix is an ingenious crypto project that analysts believe is destined for the top. It packs a PayFi protocol that facilitates instant crypto-fiat conversions, with users sending crypto from their wallets and recipients getting fiat in their bank accounts. Even more impressively, Remittix has support for more than 50 blockchains and over 30 different fiat currencies. It leverages blockchain technology, bridging crypto with global payment networks to make this happen. Since it stands to transform cross-border transactions, Remittix competes against monumental financial institutions like Western Union. However, using its modern technology on an old problem, it looks ready to take a slice of the global remittances market, an industry that is worth over $750 billion. Currently in presale and available for $0.0781, RTX would definitely skyrocket when Bitcoin hits $200K. The coin is on an upward surge already, and a bullish Bitcoin will only boost its potential returns. Analysts envisage a 100x ROI, but given Remittix’s massive potential, the actual profits could be higher. How will a Bitcoin boom affect Dogecoin? The biggest beneficiaries of a Bitcoin boom, perhaps, are memes like Dogecoin. That’s because the resulting bullish atmosphere would seriously whet investors’ appetite and they’ll go for lowly priced tokens like DOGE. Dogecoin struggled to break $0.24 in May. Source: Coinmarketcap Dogecoin hasn’t performed well over the last month, with DOGE struggling to break $0.24 throughout May. The turbocharged atmosphere created by a surging Bitcoin would definitely make DOGE go viral once more and possibly push it to a new ATH. A Litecoin price revival might be on the horizon According to crypto analyst VipRoseTR , Litecoin is showing signs of a bullish reversal, after breaking out of a falling wedge pattern. This puts Litecoin price predictions in the $100 to $200 range, which is a 95% jump from current levels. Source: Twitter/VipRoseTR Furthermore, Litecoin is widely regarded as a lighter version of Bitcoin. Should BTC clock $200K, the sentiment will definitely spill over to LTC. This could see Litecoin become relevant again and reclaim highs that haven’t been visited for years. Can a Bitcoin spike put an end to Pi Network’s struggles? Founded in 2019 by Stanford PhDs, Pi Network’s major goal is to make mining accessible via smartphones. Unlike energy-intensive blockchains, Pi allows users to “mine” simply by verifying their presence on a mobile app. This approach eliminates hardware barriers and has enabled Pi Network to snowball registered users into the 60+ million range. However, things didn’t go as planned after PI launched officially in Q1 2025. The token enjoyed a brief moment of upward bliss before crashing down hard . PI fell from a high of $3 and is barely worth $1. A Bitcoin spike is probably the only event that can inject life back into the PI project. It could revive PI’s bull run and push it to new highs, especially if the blockchain firm works hard at keeping it relevant. Conclusion A Bitcoin surge to $200K would definitely rejig PI, LTC, DOGE and RTX. However, of all these tokens, RTX is expected to appreciate more. That’s because it only just launched, has a more attractive entry point and sports immense potential. This makes it the ideal token for investors looking to maximize their crypto profits in 2025 and beyond.

The value of the donation in question reaches approximately 45 million dollars (one billion Czech crowns). At the center of the scandal is Tomáš Jiřikovský, known as the founder of Sheep Marketplace, the Czech Republic’s largest dark web illegal marketplace to date, who was released in 2021. Jiřikovský was sentenced to nine years in prison in 2017 for embezzlement and drug dealing. More than eleven thousand Bitcoin transactions were made through Sheep Marketplace in 2013 alone, with Jiřikovský taking a commission on each transaction. Related News: Significant Cryptocurrency Bill Unveiled in South Korea - Expected to Pass Easily Following Jiřikovský’s release, the court ruled to return electronic devices previously seized by police at the beginning of the year. These devices included a Bitcoin wallet and access codes. At the time of Jiřikovský’s arrest, the cryptocurrency was worth around 20 million kronor (around $800,000), and with the rise in Bitcoin prices, it has now exceeded three billion kronor (around $130 million). The ministry has taken back around one billion kronor from this wallet. However, the National Center for Combating Organized Crime (NCOZ) has opened an investigation to see if the transfer was money laundering. While detectives arrived at the Justice Ministry building to collect documents, Blažek publicly stated that the transaction was “very legal” and “could not be any more legal.” Following growing backlash in public and political circles, Blažek announced his resignation from his position. *This is not investment advice.

According to a new report by NBC News, former Goldman Sachs employee Tim Leissner has been sentenced to two years behind bars for paying a part in the multibillion-dollar heist. Prosecutors say that Leissner and others who worked for the banking giant aided Malaysia in raising $6.5 billion for the nation’s investment fund through bond sales. However, $4.5 billion of those funds were stolen, laundered via bribes and kickbacks, and used to purchase luxury goods and fund extravagant lifestyles. The report says the scandal was far-reaching and led to the downfall of then-Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak in 2018, who was later convicted of crimes connected to the scheme and sentenced to 12 years in prison. Leissner is due to report to prison on September 15th. He pleaded guilty in 2018 to bribing officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi. Says Leissner, “The funds raised more than a decade ago could have profoundly benefited the nation and its citizens. Instead, due to my greed – and the greed of those involved alongside me – they were misappropriated. What we did was unequivocally wrong, and I take full responsibility for my role. I deeply regret my actions, and if I could turn back time, I would undo them without hesitation.” Leissner’s sentence includes two years of supervised release after prison and a forfeiture of nearly $44 million.

After rising above $2000, the second-largest token has been failing to rise above a certain range. The token is consolidating around $2500, staying in an accumulation zone for the past 3 weeks. With the key support levels being around $2400 to $2310, the ETH price has seen multiple rebounds, which indicates strong buying interest. On the other hand, the price has also faced multiple rejections around $2700, which hints towards heavy selling pressure. What’s next? Will the Ethereum price continue to remain consolidated within the range? The ETH price is at a technical crossroads where the token displays both bullish and bearish scenarios. The short-term price action remains stuck within an extremely narrow range, and hence, a breakout from the pattern could only attract either the bulls or the bears. The ETH price in the STF shows the token failing to rise above the descending trend line, which is acting as a strong resistance. On the other hand, the Bollinger bands are also plunging and have begun to squeeze. Meanwhile, the Stochastic RSI has also plunged before marking the upper threshold, signifying the growing dominance of the bears. Therefore, the ETH price is required to break the descending trend line and secure $2600. However, securing the range above $2700 and $2715 may only validate a bullish reversal, as the token has faced multiple rejections from this level. In the worst case, a failure may break the pivotal support at $2450, and if the price does not trigger a rebound, a drop to $2300 or slightly lower could be imminent. Ethereum dropped by more than 45% in Q1 compared to 11.82% of Bitcoin. Meanwhile, the rise in ETH price is close to 40%, compared to 26% of that of BTC price, hence indicating the second-largest token outperforms Bitcoin in Q2. On the other hand, Sharplink Gaming is planning to buy Ethereum worth a billion dollars for its treasury along with the ETF accumulation. Meanwhile, the Ethereum price is rhyming with the 2021 breakout, which elevated the levels from $2500 to $4000. The ETH price is undergoing a similar consolidation, and hence, if history repeats, the token is primed to mark new highs in the coming months.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/ethereum-at-a-crossroads-while-2500-support-is-in-prime-focus-will-this-result-in-an-8-pullback/,"BTC|ETH|REGULATION|TRADING","Price Analysis|Ethereum",cryptocompare

He sent the money to himself—at least, that’s what the author of this article thinks. Now, around twenty-four hours ago, shortly after Ross made a historic appearance at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, a wallet tied to the former Silk Road operator suddenly received 300 BTC, worth roughly $31.4 million. According to data tracked by blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence, the funds landed in a wallet that has been publicly linked to Ross. People quickly assumed it was another round of donations he’d been receiving since being released. Source: Arkham Ross’s belongings have gotten him around $1.8 million in Bitcoin after an auction at the event. One of the pieces, his final prison ID card, was sold for 5.5 Bitcoins, or $580,380. Sleuth connects mixer trail to old exchange wallets Crypto investigator ZachXBT has been on the fence about the donation story from the start. He pointed out that the 300 BTC didn’t come straight from an exchange or a new wallet. It was funneled through Jambler, a centralized Bitcoin mixer that most privacy-conscious users don’t even touch. “Interestingly the 300 BTC appears to come from Jambler outputs,” Zach said on X, adding, “Whereas normal privacy enthusiasts use decentralized mixers like Wasabi, Samourai, etc.” Zach dug deeper and came back to share that he’d found two wallets—1Mp5hHZNv9a5Lnu7DvKtFgpneEaVK7mj39 and 1CNDWv3gX5BvhcUxR7xCE9WTFZF7M5qR2P—that had been dormant since late 2014 and 2019, respectively. Both had past exchange activity, and one of them had even been flagged in compliance systems. Zach stated that both wallets began sending large deposits into Jambler between April and May 2025—right before the 300 BTC showed up in Ross’s donation wallet. “Few entities regularly use Jambler in size,” Zach wrote . “So I found a potential demix for the donation. 1Mp5hH originates from late 2014 exchange activity. 1CNDW has 2019 exchange activity and was previously flagged in compliance tools. Both had dormant BTC from Nov 2019 until the mixer deposits.” Zach concluded that the coins were sent from addresses that shared suspicious overlaps in activity, timing, and history. Crypto Twitter reacts with confusion and sarcasm Not everyone liked the idea that Ross might’ve just dusted off his own coins. One user replied, “You’re trying too hard dude, let Ross enjoy his donation.. We don’t care where it came from.” Zach shot back, “It’s $30M not $200K. Of course it’s interesting who sent it.” The user then said, “Wouldn’t it be sick if YOU were one of the very few people who actually knew and didn’t have to let ct or the feds in on it?” Zach responded, “Everyone was accusing Ross of a self donation so if anything this proves it was a donation and not his ‘secret stash’ because there was activity when he was away in prison.” Someone else wasn’t having any of it. “You have to be truly r*tarded to think Ross would send a ‘secret stash’ to his very public address,” they wrote. And another user piled on with, “You think DPR went to jail with no bitcoin left? My man is still stuck in 2012. 300 Bitcoin through a centralized mixer. LOLOL.” This user referenced a May 6 post by Sani, the founder of TimechainIndex that alleges activity from two Bitcoin addresses—1NWPS2fWw6FMeJEjg6DMMpYxQyB4TKpVsb and 1PiEKBgsBmCT4VuwFKLdGpXMNh99ebMPf—which together moved 3,422 BTC. Those coins were traced back to Silk Road origins through historic UTXO consolidations. Sani’s findings pointed to a 10,000 BTC transaction—TXID 53952c5a7c9f461d3e274cd92227df589d2ff7eea6eeae88a67868d58d08afcb—which fed into the addresses. Another batch of funds later flowed into wallet 1GA7hEmKv9L2mh5NCfgnLFufAb7bEMdnNS, coming out of a separate 19,940 BTC consolidation, tied to TXID b555a4399797c784033863dda38abef7b8adcaf6748e9519dcb175fb1d04ee0. That same 19,940 BTC was previously seized by US authorities after Ross’s arrest. The recent movement of those old addresses was the first in over 12 years, and while the identity of whoever moved the coins remains unknown, the wallets are clearly linked to Silk Road.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ross-ulbricht-300-bitcoins-from-old-wallets/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|ARKM","OP-ED|BTC|Silk Road",cryptocompare
2025-06-02T09:10:00,"Trump Tariffs Cause Shift to Short-Term Trading Strategies, Says Taoshi CEO","The imposition of trade tariffs by US President Donald Trump has significantly changed trading behaviors to prioritize quick, short-term profit-taking over extended position holding. This observation comes from Arrash Yasavolian, CEO and founder of the Bittensor-based Taoshi AI-enhanced trading platform, who notes a distinct pivot in investor approach. A Shift in Short-Term Traders In a recent interview , Yasavolian explained that the tariffs have introduced a new layer of headline-driven volatility across financial markets, leading to rapid and extreme shifts in sentiment, often within a single trading day. Yasavolian stated that “Trading behavior has essentially changed to be more intraday — when you have your profit, you just take it when you can get it.” He added that this indicates a cutting of confidence in sustained upside or downside movements when traders take long or short positions. Traders and investors are grappling with this evolving macroeconomic landscape, leading to a more cautious and agile approach to market participation. Trade Tariffs Shake Investor Confidence The ongoing trade tensions, particularly between the US and China , are being closely watched by crypto investors for any indication of a lasting trade deal. Analysts widely predict that such a resolution would trigger a sustained price rally across both altcoins and Bitcoin. Recently, there was a glimmer of positive news when President Trump announced on May 25 a delay in tariffs on European Union (EU) goods, extending the deadline to July 9. Crypto markets reacted favorably to this development, with the price of Bitcoin climbing by over 3% in an intraday move. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the EU Commission, commented on this extension in a May 25 X post, highlighting the “world’s most consequential and close trade relationship” between the EU and US, and affirming Europe’s readiness to “advance talks swiftly and decisively.” Despite these political reassurances of productive trade discussions and a potential resolution to the escalating tensions, some analysts remain cynical. They suggest that any perceived progress in negotiations, tariff exemptions, or softening of rhetoric might be illusory, primarily serving political optics rather than signifying substantive and lasting economic change.

2025-06-02T09:09:32,"LSE-listed IG Group opens Bitcoin, Ether, and memecoin spot trading in UK","United Kingdom-based publicly listed trading firm IG Group has launched spot cryptocurrency trading for retail investors. According to a June 1 announcement , IG customers can now access 31 digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, and a selection of altcoins and memecoins such as Bonk. IG Group’s first direct crypto offering IG Group is a London-headquartered financial services firm listed on the London Stock Exchange under the ticker IGG. Up until now, it only offered online trading and investment services across forex, indices, stocks, and commodities. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency exposure was limited to contracts for difference (CFDs), a derivative product that allows traders to speculate on price movements without owning the underlying asset. Unlike spot trading, CFDs do not involve actual crypto ownership, making the latest launch IG Group’s first direct offering of digital assets to its customers. The new crypto trading service is offered in partnership with Uphold, a U.S.-based cryptocurrency platform that is regulated in both the United States and the United Kingdom. Uphold will handle all customer transactions and provide pricing data, with its infrastructure fully integrated into IG’s trading platform and the IG Invest app, and users will be able to switch between crypto and other asset classes, including equities. IG UK Managing Director Michael Healy described the move as a significant milestone in Britain’s crypto journey, adding that retail investors can now engage in crypto trading “with a grown-up business.” The firm said the offering is part of its long-term strategy to meet evolving investor demands and position itself within the growing digital asset economy. Crypto regulations gaining momentum in UK IG’s new product launch comes at a time when UK regulators are advancing efforts to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. On May 28, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) launched a public consultation on proposed rules for stablecoin issuers and crypto custody providers. Under the proposal, the government plans to bring crypto activities in line with traditional financial standards. For instance, stablecoin issuers would be required to provide holders the right to redeem at par value, maintain clear disclosures on backing assets, and appoint independent custodians. Custody providers, meanwhile, would need to ensure assets are securely held and accessible at all times. David Geale, the FCA’s executive director of payments and digital finance, said the agency is committed to supporting innovation while fostering market integrity. The FCA also confirmed it is coordinating with the Bank of England, which is expected to release complementary guidance for stablecoins operating at a systemic scale later this year. These measures build on broader reforms unveiled by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in April. The UK Treasury announced a draft legislative framework under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Cryptoassets) Order 2025, introducing six new regulated crypto activities, including trading, custody, and staking. Meanwhile, tax authorities have also moved to tighten oversight of the sector . Starting January 1, 2026, crypto firms would be required to collect and report detailed user information, including names, addresses, dates of birth, and tax identification numbers, for all customers and transactions.

2025-06-02T09:08:41,"Bitcoin Struggles to Hold $105K After Strong Monthly Close","Bitcoin attempted to stabilize above $105,000 on June 1 following a strong monthly performance that saw an 11% gain for May. The cryptocurrency faced ongoing pressure throughout the week, bringing it back to key support levels established earlier in the 2024 bull market. Among these was the December 17 local high of roughly $104,450, which traders watched closely heading into the new week. Analyst Matthew Hyland labeled the weekly close as “pivotal” for the short-term trend. Hyland pointed to a developing bearish divergence between Bitcoin’s price and its relative strength index (RSI) on the weekly chart. RSI, which gauges momentum, appeared to weaken even as price attempted to climb—raising caution flags for traders. Bearish Divergence Raises Concerns Trader Titan of Crypto echoed those concerns, warning his followers that a potential RSI bearish divergence was forming. “Still unconfirmed but worth watching,” he posted on May 31, alongside a chart referencing Fibonacci-based fair value gaps (FVGs). These gaps often indicate price areas where trading activity was unbalanced, and two key FVG zones were highlighted at $97,000 and $90,000. Titan added, “After a +50% run, a cooldown wouldn’t be a bad thing. Healthy market structure matters.” $100K Level Could Act as Magnet CrypNuevo, another trader analyzing order book data, suggested that $100,000 could serve as a price magnet if selling pressure continues. “It’s a strong psychological level and liquidity tends to stack in these levels,” they noted, anticipating a possible retest. Despite Bitcoin’s 8% decline over the past week, CrypNuevo remained bullish on the broader trend. “So I think we’ll probably drop to $100k and play around there for some days… even a slight temporary drop below it to shake the market would make sense,” they predicted. They concluded that overall market structure remains bullish, with the bull market support level near $84,000 closing in from below.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/bitcoin-struggles-to-hold-105k-after-strong-monthly-close/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

Most altcoins are with minor gains today, including HYPE, which has posted a 3% increase. XMR leads the larger-cap alts with a 6% surge. BTC Aims at $106K The all-time high registered on May 22 was followed by a violent correction on the following day when US President Trump warned that the EU might face another set of tariffs. Although the two parties reached some sort of an agreement and the tariffs were delayed for over a month, BTC failed to recapture its momentum and was stopped at $110,000 on a couple of occasions during the previous business week. It continued to trade sideways until Friday evening, when Trump blamed China for violating their trade agreement. Beijing responded almost immediately, and bitcoin slumped by several grand. The culmination transpired on Saturday when BTC slipped to $103,100, which became a 12-day low . However, it maintained that level on Sunday and even recovered some ground to around $104,000. During the Monday morning Asian trading session, BTC added a few more grand and tapped $106,000, where it faced some rejection and now sits about $500 lower. Its market cap has risen to $2.1 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the altcoins is up to 61.5%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView XMR Pumps Most altcoins have marked insignificant gains over the past 24 hours, such as XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, TRX, ADA, and SUI. HYPE stands out as the top performer from the largest 20 alts, while ETH has slipped inches below $2,500. Monero’s native token has gained the most from the top 60 alts, as a 5.4% increase has pushed it to over $345. Other impressive performers include FLR, SPX, and FARTCOIN. The total crypto market cap has increased by around $30 billion since yesterday and is up to $3.41 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.
