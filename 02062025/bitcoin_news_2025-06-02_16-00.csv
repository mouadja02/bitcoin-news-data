2025-06-02T13:54:40,"Elon Musk Faces Backlash Over ‘Bitcoin-Style Encryption’ Claim in XChat Launch","Elon Musk’s latest announcement about a new encrypted messaging feature on X has ignited a firestorm, not for the feature itself, but for his baffling description of its underlying tech. On June 1, the X owner revealed via his official account on the social platform that the new XChat has been “built on Rust with (Bitcoin style) encryption.” Why Experts Say “Bitcoin-Style Encryption” is Nonsense Shortly after Musk’s post , a flood of commentary emerged, challenging the accuracy of his terminology. Notably, Bitcoin advocate Udi Wertheimer responded bluntly: “Bitcoin literally doesn’t have any encryption in it whatsoever.” The Taproot Wizards co-creator followed up by explaining that BTC uses cryptographic hashing and signing, which are essential for verifying data integrity and ownership, but do not conceal messages, a key function of encryption. “Encryption is when you have a message and want to keep it secret. Nothing in the Bitcoin protocol is encrypted… It’s all open, transparent, and viewable by anyone.” Adding to the chorus, cryptographer Ian Miers pointed out Bitcoin’s lack of privacy, likening it to a social media platform for bank accounts. “Everything you do is broadcast publicly,” he stated. “It’s the opposite of private.” The Zcash co-founder stressed that BTC transactions rely on signatures for authentication, rather than encryption for secrecy. He further critiqued the vagueness of Musk’s statement, writing: “Needless to say, ‘Bitcoin style’ and ‘Rust’ are not descriptions of an encryption scheme, nor are they strong indicators of security for a messaging app.” However, several other voices supported the Tesla CEO, with some guessing that he may have meant SHA-256 hashing. Computer engineer Wei Dai also offered a charitable interpretation , suggesting that Musk might have equated “Bitcoin-style” with “peer-to-peer” or “end-to-end” encryption. However, this theory failed to clarify what encryption protocols XChat actually uses, and such ambiguity only added fuel to the fire. Musk Under Scrutiny The ongoing debate comes amid broader concern surrounding Musk’s leadership. Just a month ago, Tesla was forced to issue a public denial following claims by the Wall Street Journal that the electric car manufacturer was in the market for a new CEO. This was supposedly due to investor unease over the 53-year-old’s controversial political engagements and erratic online behavior. The Tesla board responded, reaffirming its complete confidence in Musk’s leadership. This latest episode with XChat risks further undermining the outspoken billionaire’s credibility among technologists. As pseudonymous developer Yueya.eth aptly put it: “Marketing teams love throwing around crypto buzzwords without understanding basics.” And in an ecosystem where language and accuracy build trust, the Boring Company founder’s vague phrasing may cause more confusion than hype.

2025-06-02T13:50:24,"SHIB Price Prediction: $0.50 Not Likely, but Unilabs Could Turn $300 to $9,000","Shiba Inu, the biggest memecoin in Ethereum’s chain right now, dropped for four consecutive days and reached a low of $0.000012, which is its lowest level since April. The SHIB price has moved into a technical bear market, falling by almost 30% from its highest point in May. Shiba Inu’s decline is because of the ongoing crypto sell-off that has affected all types of coins. SHIB Price Crashes Amid Slow Burn Rate And Massive Offload Also, Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped from an all-time high of $111,900 last week to $103,000. The SHIB price has also crashed as its network faces substantial challenges. First, data shows that the Shiba Inu whales have been in a selling spree this year. Supply held by these investors started the year at 743 trillion and has now dropped to 723 trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB). Source: TradingView Shibarium (the layer-2 network) is also not doing well, as its total value locked is stuck at $2.92 million. In comparison, Uniswap (UNI) launched earlier this year with a TVL of over $600 million. Further, Shiba Inu’s token burn rate has lost momentum in the past few weeks. This week’s biggest burn was an 18 million transaction, directly affecting the SHIB price. Investing $300 in Unilabs Now Could Turn Into $9,000? While Shiba Inu (SHIB) struggles to hold ground in a shaky market, dropping nearly 30% from its May highs and facing slowed network growth, Unilabs (UNIL) is shaping up to be the AI-powered gem that could flip the narrative. Shiba Inu’s token burn rate is down, whales are exiting, and Shibarium is losing steam with under $3 million locked. Meanwhile, Unilabs boasts over $30 million in assets under management, introducing AI adoption in crypto with real-time data analysis and early-stage investment tracking. While the SHIB price hopes for $0.01 someday, Unilabs investors are already eyeing real value growth where a $300 investment could realistically surge past $9,000 as the ecosystem gains traction. Unilabs (UNIL) Takes the Lead Amid Memecoin Market Shakedown Among several dominating factors, what sets Unilabs (UNIL) apart is its AI-powered Launchpad, a robust infrastructure that basically never sleeps. It scans the crypto market for emerging projects daily, filtering hype from true potential. Instead of waiting for a coin to trend, Unilabs identifies high-growth tokens before they hit mainstream headlines. With tools like the Early Access Scoring System (EASS) and AI Market Pulse, Unilabs dominates projects like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, making data-backed investing easier, faster, and smarter. This isn’t just another DeFi asset manager, but an AI hedge fund for the everyday investor. Unilabs native token also offers a golden ticket opportunity to holders. This AI token is about exposure to elite-level projects, unlocking dividends, early access, governance power, and staking rewards. With each tier that holders move up, their share of the 30% platform fee redistribution grows. This unique advantage makes the UNIL token a must-have in 2025. Conclusion: As AI continues to lead the next crypto bull run, it won’t be a surprise if UNIL surges past $0.10 or even $0.25 in the next 12 to 18 months. While the current SHIB price and other memecoins are driven by community hype and speculative hope, Unilabs brings structure, data, and sustainable growth. And it’s not about luck, it’s about timing and tech. While the broader crypto ecosystem is leaning into AI, real-world assets, and institutional-grade DeFi, Unilabs platform fundamentals lead the charge and dominate other crypto giants. The memecoin network may have the memes, but Unilabs (UNIL) has the math, the momentum, and the money. Check out its fast-selling presale today.

But on-chain data tells a different story. Less than a day after his public exit, on-chain records noted that Wynn opened a fresh $100 million long on Bitcoin at $105,890.30, using 40x leverage. Source: Hypurrscan $100M High, $117.5M Swing, and a Brutal Exit: James Wynn Wild BTC Ride James Wynn, a rare transparent crypto whale, made headlines in May with a series of massive, high-leverage Bitcoin trades.

Here’s what it all means. #JamesWynn #Hyperliquid #Bitcoin https://t.co/0zaR5Z0VyQ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 28, 2025 On May 21, he opened a $830M long on BTC, later adding another $1.1B as BTC crossed $111K, bringing his unrealized profits to nearly $40M. The 40x leveraged position had a liquidation level of $107,975. Initially profitable, the trade soured after Bitcoin dropped following Trump’s tariff announcement. On May 25, Wynn attempted to hedge with an $856M BTC short, also 40x leveraged, but exited just 15 hours later with a $15.5M loss. His last profitable trade came on May 24, netting $18.4M as part of a risk management effort. Yet the same day, he closed a $1.25B long on Hyperliquid at a $13.4M loss , despite it having briefly shown $40M in paper gains. He also exited a 540 BTC sale for $1.5M profit during the same period. Wynn’s cumulative swings totaled $117.5M, with one of his largest exits occurring after BTC dipped to $107,431, just shy of his $104K liquidation price. He confirmed the exit on X, stating he had “cut his losses.” Prior to this, he had earned $25.19M from a PEPE long. The collapse marked the end of a dramatic journey from $4M to a $100M portfolio peak. In a reflective X thread, Wynn called his final hours “surreal,” admitting he posted cryptic warnings as prices neared liquidation. I've decided to give perp trading a break. Thank you @HyperliquidX for your hospitality. Your service, impeccable. Your platform exquisite. Its been a fun ride. Approx $4m into $100m and then back down to a total account loss of $17,500,000. The time has come for me to… — James Wynn (@JamesWynnReal) June 2, 2025 He blamed real-time funding costs on Hyperliquid for draining his capital: “The cost wasn’t just emotional. It was literal—bleeding by the second.” Despite vowing to step back, blockchain data from Hypurrscan confirmed that hours later, Wynn re-entered with a new $100M BTC long, again on Hyperliquid, again at 40x leverage, with an entry at $105,890.30. As of the latest update, the position is down $1.7 million, and Wynn appears to be adding to it to avoid liquidation.

His position, now the largest on Hyperliquid, reignited interest in decentralized exchanges (DEXs). While some applaud his transparency, others see it as reckless.

2025-06-02T13:35:33,"Is Musk’s New XChat Bitcoin Encryption Too Good to Be True?","Musk's XChat Promises Bitcoin-Style Encryption — Is It Credible? Elon Musk is at it again in the virtual world—this time by promising to roll out ”Bitcoin-style” end-to-end encryption onto XChat, the revamped direct messaging service on X (formerly Twitter). The announcement, delivered in true Musk fashion via a tweet, has excited some and left most of the industry insiders and observers in the tech and cryptocurrency worlds unconvinced. XChat, which is written completely in the Rust programming language, is shipping with a raft of privacy-focused features: end-to-end encrypted messaging, disappearing messages, any-file-type support, and cross-platform video and audio calls — all without users needing a phone number. Musk says XChat's encryption is built on the same robust cryptographic foundations that protect Bitcoin, but what does that actually mean? Cracking ”Bitcoin-Style” Encryption Bitcoin's own security relies upon elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), specifically the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), which allows users to generate public/private key pairs and securely sign messages. In discussing messaging, ”Bitcoin-style” cryptography likely means that XChat would utilize similar ECC-based techniques — i.e., Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) for secure key exchange and ECIES for message encryption. This can provide strong, efficient end-to-end security, with only the sender and recipient capable of reading the messages. However, as some cryptography experts have pointed out, Bitcoin itself does not encrypt transactions, but rather signs them, so that the ”Bitcoin-style encryption” label is more of a marketing phrase than an engineering term. Security researcher Ian Miers further contributed, ”Bitcoin primarily uses signatures, not encryption. It's like saying, we decided to drive our rocket on water, as NASA uses Hydrogen and Oxygen”. Others comment that Rust is a secure, new language, but it's not exactly a guarantee of cryptographic correctness. Security Experts: Divergent Perspectives and Outstanding Issues The cryptosphere and security communities disagree. Some privacy champions welcome XChat's move as a step long overdue toward the mainstream embrace of strong encryption, potentially signing up millions for public-key cryptography and secure digital communication as the new standard. Others caution that in the absence of open-source code and third-party audit, individuals are putting their trust in Musk's guarantee—a risky bet in the wake of the platform's recent history of data breaches. “Needless to say ‘Bitcoin style’ and ‘Rust’ are not descriptions of an encryption scheme, nor are they strong indicators of security for a messaging app.” — Ian Miers, cryptography professor, on X “XChat’s ECC-based protocols could set a new standard for privacy, but only if they’re transparent and auditable.” — @PrivacyMatters, June 2, 2025 Mainstream Effect: Crypto Onboarding or Confusion? If XChat's security stands up to examination, it is a privacy game-changer for mass market messaging. The disappearing messages, file sharing, and phone number-less accounts place XChat on a head-to-head collision course with WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram, but with the added twist of crypto-motivated security. Some believe this could demystify public-key cryptography for millions, paving the way for more mass-market use of crypto. Yet, the lack of technical clarity and the closed nature of X’s stack have left many experts cautious. Without open protocols or code audits, it’s impossible to know if XChat’s encryption is as “Bitcoin-grade” as Musk claims — or if it’s simply marketing spin Whether XChat's encryption is genuine privacy innovation or just good marketing, one thing is certain: the battle for secure messaging—and crypto's place in mainstream tech — is only just starting.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9399/is-musk-s-new-x-chat-bitcoin-encryption-too-good-to-be-true,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","News|Security",cryptocompare

His idea? A dark pool perpetual swap DEX designed to protect whales from front-running, MEV bot attacks, and liquidation hunting. If it sounds intriguing, that’s because it is. Read on to know more. Given recent events, I think now might be a good time for someone to launch a dark pool perp DEX. I have always been puzzled with the fact that everyone can see your orders in real-time on a DEX. The problem is worse on a perp DEX where there are liquidations. Even with a CEX… — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) June 1, 2025 The Problem with Transparent DEXs Zhao’s proposal addresses a significant flaw in current decentralized exchanges (DEXs): the visibility of orders in real time. “If you’re looking to purchase $1 billion worth of a coin, you wouldn’t want others to notice until it’s completed,” Zhao stated in his X post. This issue becomes even more problematic on perpetual DEXs where liquidation levels are visible. Bad actors can coordinate attacks that push prices toward these thresholds, triggering mass liquidations. Case in Point: The $100M Liquidation on Hyperliquid CZ’s remarks came shortly after a dramatic incident involving trader James Wynn, who reportedly held nearly $100 million in long BTC positions on Hyperliquid. When Bitcoin briefly dropped below $105,000, Wynn’s positions were liquidated – prompting widespread speculation that it was a coordinated “liquidation hunt.” Rumors swirled on X that Tron’s Justin Sun had shown interest in the group allegedly behind the event, and that Eric Trump – yes, the son of U.S. President Donald Trump – had even been invited. While none of these claims are confirmed, the chatter underscores how exposed large traders are in today’s transparent DeFi markets. Dark Pools: A TradFi Solution for DeFi Dark pools aren’t new – they’ve long existed in traditional finance (TradFi) as private venues where large trades happen away from public order books. As CZ pointed out, these pools are often “10 times bigger” than transparent ones, shielding traders from front-running, slippage, and unnecessary market impact. Translating that model to DeFi, however, is no small feat. According to StealthEX CEO Maria Carola, “the fundamental challenge in building a dark pool-style perp DEX is achieving both privacy and verifiability.” She suggested technologies like zk-SNARKs or zk-STARKs could make this possible, allowing trades to be validated without revealing sensitive details. Balancing Privacy and Security in DeFi Still, Carola cautioned that “opacity is a double-edged sword.” While it reduces front-running risks, it can also obscure manipulative behavior, especially in leveraged environments like perpetual swaps. To offset this, she recommended integrating adaptive risk engines and behavioral anomaly detection, ideally with cryptographic accountability baked in. In short, if we’re going to hide trades, we’d better watch the system closely. So… Is a Dark Pool DEX the Future? CZ isn’t claiming his idea is perfect. In fact, he acknowledged that transparency can help market makers absorb large orders, making some forms of openness valuable. What he is doing, however, is pushing the space to evolve. He encouraged developers to explore on-chain dark pool designs, whether by hiding the order book or delaying visibility of smart contract deposits, to build a more balanced, secure environment for institutional-scale traders.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/binances-cz-calls-for-dark-pool-dex-after-100m-hyperliquid-liquidation/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|BNB","News",cryptocompare

2025-06-02T13:21:05,"Why Is Crypto Down Today? – June 2, 2025","The crypto market has seen minor decreases again. The majority of the top 100 coins are down over the past 24 hours, yet the majority of these have seen a near-0.1% drop. At the same time, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has decreased by 4.5%, falling to $3.39 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $73.7 billion, the lowest we’ve seen in weeks. TLDR: Crypto market sees another small decrease; Market sentiment moves into the neutral zone; Bitcoin may see a pullback to as low as $74,500 before another major bull run; Analysts highlight institutional interest in crypto, particularly BTC and ETH; US spot BTC ETFs recorded outflows, while spot ETH ETFs saw inflows; The market can go either way now and is sensitive to macroeconomic influences. Crypto Winners & Losers While four of the top 10 coins per market capitalization are green, only one has a rise of over 0.5%, meaning three are practically unchanged. Bitcoin (BTC) is one of these, having appreciated 0.2% to the price of $104,884. Ethereum (ETH) fell by 1.2% today – the highest among the red coins. It’s now trading at $2,494. Just like the green coins, the rest of the red coins are practically unchanged. TRON (TRX) is the category’s best performer at the time of writing, having increased by 1% to the price of $0.2714. Of the top 100 coins, about 20 have seen their prices rise over the past day. Flare (FLR) is the biggest gainer in this category. It’s up 9.4%, currently trading at $0.01925. On the other side, Bittensor (TAO) decreased the most in this category. It’s down 7.1% to $406.2. Meanwhile, Tron has recently partnered with Rumble Cloud to provide Tron with data storage infrastructure. . @justinsuntron joined @chrispavlovski and @matt_kohrs on @rumblevideo to discuss #TRON ’s recent strategic collaboration with @rumblecloud and the shared values across both platforms. pic.twitter.com/O7tu0tFMEL — TRON DAO (@trondao) May 29, 2025 Notably, Bitcoin settled over $2.9 trillion on-chain, according to the Glassnode and CME H1 2025 report. Despite the volatility and lower prices, “Bitcoin’s role as a global settlement layer holds strong with trillions moved on-chain and transactional utility undiminished,” it says. BTC May Drop to $88,000 Before Running to $136,000 John Glover, Chief Investment Officer of Ledn , expects to see a significant pullback, with BTC dropping to $88,000, or perhaps even $74,500. That said, he also expects it to start the next run after that and hit new all-time highs “Although an unpopular and somewhat contrarian view, I continue to expect that we are in a short-term topping pattern for BTCUSD, as wave(i) of Wave 5 looks to have completed [yellow line on the chart],” Glover says. Source: John Glover We will likely see a pullback to the $88,000 to $93,000 area as a wave (ii) target before the next leg up. This is a corrective move, Glover explains, and it “should take us into mid-to-late summer.” “Keep in mind that wave (i) can be completely retraced by wave (ii), so a retest of the $74,500 low of Wave IV is not out of the question. But my expectations continue to be for a rally to $133,000-$136,000 into the end of this year/beginning of next.” Furthermore, according to Dom Harz, Co-Founder of Layer-2 BOB , institutions are increasingly taking notice. The number of publicly listed companies holding BTC in treasuries has increased from 89 in April to 113. This signals that “institutional adoption is entering a new phase.” Disclosure: https://t.co/bqFEEQMRcT — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) June 2, 2025 “Following last year’s record-breaking ETF approvals, the question is no longer if institutions will engage with Bitcoin, but how they’ll unlock its full potential,” Harz says. “We’ve seen Bitcoin evolve from a fringe asset for tech-savvy retail investors into the darling of global institutions. But what’s most exciting is what comes next: the utility phase of Bitcoin.” Moreover, Harz argues that Bitcoin DeFi is “at the heart of this shift.” It allows holders of all sizes to deploy BTC into protocols that generate yield and unlock new levels of utility. “Institutions won’t just want to hold Bitcoin, they’ll want to put it to work. And as they do, they’ll accelerate the development of the Bitcoin DeFi technology that turns this next chapter into reality,” the exec says. Levels & Events to Watch Next BTC currently trades at $104,884, which is a decrease from $105,816 seen on Friday and the intraday high of $105.804. It’s also down 6.2% from the all-time high of $111,814 hit ten days ago. The coin has largely been trading around the $105,000 level over the last few hours. However, it broke several support levels over the past several days. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: Tradingview Moreover, the Fear and Greed Index keeps falling. It has entered the neutral territory, now standing at 57 . The drop out of the extreme greed indicates that the market sentiment has turned towards fear, fueled by several consecutive days of falling prices. Source: CoinMarketCap Meanwhile, on 30 May, US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a significant net outflow of $616.22 million . Not even BlackRock saw inflows today, recording a net outflow of $430.82 million. On the other hand, US ETH spot ETFs saw inflows again, this time $70.24 million. The entirety of this amount comes from BlackRock. Source: SoSoValue However, as Dom Harz indicated above, institutional investors are still pushing strong. Japanese firm Metaplanet bought an additional 1,088 BTC at an average price of $108,600 per coin. In total, it has spent some $118 million on acquiring BTC, now holding 8,888 BTC.

The regulator argues that the products may not qualify as ETFs under current regulations. Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? The crypto market saw a decrease, while the stock market saw a mixed picture. The S&P 500 has decreased by 0.0081%, and the Nasdaq-100 is down 0.11%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 0.13%. The stock market reacted well to Nvidia’s profits, but the gains were limited nonetheless. The stock market is still affected by trade war fears fueled by US President Donald Trump’s constant shifts and threats, making the economic situation highly unstable and uncertain. Is this dip sustainable? The market still seems to be consolidating, and analysts don’t see a bearish reversal happening yet. However, fear is creeping into the space, and macroeconomic conditions such as interest rates and liquidity can pull prices higher or push them lower.

2025-06-02T13:13:42,"Crypto Price Analysis 6-2: BITCOIN: BTC, ETHEREUM: ETH, Solana: SOL, DOGECOIN: DOGE, ALGORAND: ALGO, BITTENSOR: TAO","The crypto market cap has started the week with a marginal increase despite most cryptocurrencies trading in the red. Bitcoin (BTC) slumped to a low of $103,892 over the weekend before recovering to cross $105,000 early in today’s session. However, it could not stay at this level and fell to its current level, with the price only marginally up in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) continued its downward trajectory and has dipped below $2,500. The price is down over 1%, trading around $2,496. Ripple (XRP) is marginally up, trading around $2.17, while Solana (SOL) is marginally down, trading around $155. Dogecoin (DOGE) , Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) , and Litecoin (LTC) are marginally up, while Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , and Polkadot (DOT) have registered notable declines. South Korean Crypto Industry Wins Irrespective Of Election Results South Korea’s crypto industry will have an advantage irrespective of the country’s presidential election results, as both candidates have campaigned on a pro-crypto platform and have pledged to ease regulations and crypto access. South Korea goes to polls on June 3 in a snap election to replace Yoon Suk-yeol, who was impeached and removed from office after attempting to declare martial law in December 2024. Lee Jae-myung from the center-left Democratic Party is leading the polls. Lee has proposed legalizing spot crypto ETFs and wants South Korea’s $884 billion national pension fund to invest in cryptocurrency. He has also advocated for stablecoins backed by the South Korean won to modernize the South Korean financial system. “We need to establish a won-backed stablecoin market to prevent national wealth from leaking overseas. I will create a safe investment environment so people can build assets and plan for the future.” Lee Jae-myung is up against conservative and People Power Party nominee Kim Moon-soo. Kim also supports legalizing spot crypto ETFs and has supported Lee’s proposal in a rare bipartisan agreement. Simon Seojoon Kim, CEO of Seoul-based venture capital firm Hashed Ventures, said with all candidates supporting pro-crypto policies, the country’s crypto sector will be the winner regardless of the outcome. Santander Unveils Stablecoin Strategy Banco Santander is evaluating a broader entry into digital assets, focusing on launching a stablecoin and expanding crypto access for retail clients through its digital arm, Openbank. Banco Santander is one of the largest financial institutions in Europe. The bank’s efforts are aligned with growing institutional interest in crypto across Europe. According to reports, Openbank has submitted license applications under the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework. The move would expand Santander’s involvement in blockchain infrastructure, which includes early investments in Ripple Labs and participation in Fnality International. Fnality and Santander are collaborating to use digital representations of central bank money for real-time settlement of tokenized securities and cross-border payments. Major European banks are embracing digital assets thanks to the clarity offered by MiCA regulations. BBVA has secured approval to offer Bitcoin and Ethereum trading in Spain, while Societe Generale has introduced a MiCA-compliant euro stablecoin on the Stellar blockchain. Wintermute’s New Code To Flag Verified Malicious Contracts Ethereum users will be warned of attacks capable of draining their wallets thanks to crypto market maker Wintermute, which claims to have created a code that injects a warning into verified malicious contracts. The code, dubbed “CrimeEnjoyor,” prints a warning within malicious Ethereum contracts designed to auto-sweep funds from wallets with leaked private keys. The warning reads that the malicious contract is “used by bad guys to automatically sweep all incoming ETH” and warns users not to send any ETH. The contracts have been exploiting a feature introduced in the Ethereum Pectra upgrade called the Ethereum Improvement Proposal - 7702, which allows users to temporarily delegate control of their wallets to smart contracts. According to Wintermute’s research team, over 97% of all EIP-7702 delegations were authorized to multiple contracts, using the same code. “These are sweepers used to automatically drain incoming ETH from compromised addresses.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has stalled around the $105,000 mark as it struggles to cross the 20-day SMA. The flagship cryptocurrency has failed to regain momentum after registering a substantial decline last week, turning bearish after hitting a new all-time high on May 22. Analysts believe a bearish turn was likely after BTC’s rally as holders wanted to realize massive profits. As a result, profit-taking and buyer exhaustion took the wind out of BTC’s rally. With bearish sentiment growing, BTC could drop to $100,000 or lower as it enters another accumulation phase after a short-lived price discovery phase. The accumulation is visible on BTC’s hourly chart, showing the cryptocurrency consolidating between $103,000 and $105,000. One pseudo-anonymous analyst explained BTC’s price action over the past few weeks, stating that the flagship cryptocurrency has exhibited a textbook accumulation phase, partly responsible for pushing BTC to a new all-time high. The analyst revealed that BTC was experiencing more compression as it moved higher, reaching higher lows while resistance remained flat. Simultaneously, selling pressure had waned, putting buyers in control of the price action. Analysts believe recent price action supports a decline to $100,000 or lower. However, if this happens, it could be an ideal opportunity to buy, as the area below $100,000 could attract liquidity, helping BTC bounce and start another rally. “This potential pullback should not be viewed solely as a sign of weakness. In many bull cycles, such corrections and shakeouts serve to flush out over-leveraged positions and reset sentiment, ultimately laying the groundwork for renewed upward momentum.” BTC registered a dramatic plunge on Friday, losing momentum after reaching a new all-time high a day prior. The flagship cryptocurrency fell nearly 4% to $107,356. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered over the weekend, rising 0.46% on Saturday and 1.16% on Sunday to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,103. The price registered a marginal increase on Monday but was back in the red on Tuesday, falling 0.46% to $108,954. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC fell 1.03% to $107,834. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price dropped over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at 105,662. Source: TradingView Price action remained bearish on Friday as BTC fell 1.51%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,067. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Saturday, rising 0.69% to settle at $104,784. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as BTC rose almost 1% to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,775. However, the price lost momentum during the ongoing session as it struggled to build momentum and cross the 20-day SMA. BTC could slip to $100,000 or lower if the current bearish sentiment persists. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) was rejected from the $2,800 level on Thursday. As a result, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency plunged almost 4% on Friday and has struggled to reclaim key levels. The price briefly dipped below the crucial $2,500 level but has found support at this level, with buyers attempting to reclaim $2,500 and push higher. ETH is now entering a consolidating phase, forming a low at around $2,450 and $2,500. If positive momentum returns, ETH faces resistance around $2,550-$2,600. A break above these levels could see the price retest the $2,800 level. On the other hand, a dip could cause the price to fall to $2,450 or lower. ETH registered a sharp drop on Friday (May 23), falling over 5% to $2,527. The drop came after a substantial rally that took the price past $2,600 a day prior. Despite the drop, ETH recovered over the weekend, registering a marginal increase on Saturday and increasing almost 1% on Sunday to settle at $2,551. The price continued pushing higher on Monday, rising 0.49% to $2,564. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as ETH rose nearly 4% to reclaim $2,600 and settle at $2,662. Source: TradingView ETH continued pushing higher on Wednesday, rising nearly 1% and settling at $2,683. The price raced to an intraday high of $2,791 on Thursday as buyers attempted a move past $2,800. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and fell nearly 2% to $2,633. Bearish sentiment intensified on Friday as ETH fell almost 4%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $2,532. The price registered a marginal decline on Saturday but recovered on Sunday, rising 0.44% to $2,539. The current session sees ETH down almost 2%, having slipped below $2,500 and struggling to regain momentum. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) could face further selling pressure after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) raised questions about proposed Solana and Ethereum ETFs. The market regulator raised concerns about whether the ETFs qualify under the Investment Company Act of 1940. With the crypto markets turning bearish, SOL investors are beginning to doubt optimistic price predictions, with on-chain metrics showing many whales are liquidating SOL and moving to more stable investments. SOL had raced to an intraday high of $187 on Friday (May 23). However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped over 3% to $173. The price recovered on Saturday, rising 1.09% to $175, but fell back on Sunday, dropping to a low of $169 before moving back to $175, ultimately registering a marginal decline. SOL remained bearish on Monday, dropping 0.46%, but recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.03% and moving to $176. Selling pressure returned Wednesday as SOL fell over 2.50%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $172. Source: TradingView Sellers retained control on Thursday as the price fell over 3%, slipping below $170 and settling at $166. Bearish sentiment intensified on Friday as SOL plunged over 6%, falling below $160 and settling at $156. The price faced volatility on Saturday but recovered to register a marginal increase. SOL plunged to an intraday low of $150 on Sunday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register an increase of nearly 1% and settle at $157. SOL is back in the red during the ongoing session, with the price down over 2%, slipping below the 50-day SMA and trading around $154. SOL could slip below $150 if sellers retain control. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Analysis Dogecoin (DOGE) began the previous weekend in the red, dropping nearly 8% on Friday and settling at $0.225. The price registered a marginal decline on Saturday and fell to an intraday low of $0.214 before rebounding to reclaim $0.225. Selling pressure persisted on Monday, with DOGE registering a marginal decline. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising 0.76% despite facing volatility and selling pressure and settling at $0.226. However, it was back in the red on Wednesday, falling 2.38% to $0.221. Source: TradingView DOGE rose to an intraday high of $0.228 on Thursday. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped over 3% to $0.214. Selling pressure intensified on Friday as the price plunged almost 10%, slipping below $0.20 and settling at $0.193. Price action remained bearish on Saturday as DOGE registered a marginal drop and settled at $0.192. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, DOGE recovered on Sunday, rising 0.99% and settling at $0.194. The current session sees DOGE down nearly 3%, trading around $0.189. Algorand (ALGO) Price Analysis Algorand (ALGO) has traded downwards since May 12, when it lost momentum after reaching an intraday high of $0.258. Price action followed a similar trajectory at the beginning of last weekend as ALGO plunged nearly 7% on Friday, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $0.223. ALGO continued declining on Saturday, dropping 1.60%, and fell to an intraday low of $0.211 on Sunday as selling pressure intensified. However, it recovered from this level to register an increase of almost 1% and settle at $0.222. ALGO registered a drop of 1.50% on Monday, falling to $0.218. Despite the negative start to the week, the price recovered on Tuesday, rising over 1% and settling at $0.221. Source: TradingView ALGO was back in the red on Wednesday, dropping over 2% and settling at $0.216. Sellers retained control on Thursday as the price fell 3.31%, slipping below the 50-day SMA and settling at $0.209. Bearish sentiment intensified on Friday as ALGO plunged nearly 9%, falling below $0.20 and settling at $0.191. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, ALGO recovered over the weekend, rising 1.76% on Saturday and 0.38% on Sunday to settle at $0.195. The current session sees the price down over 2%, trading around $0.191. Buyers will look to regain control and push the price back above $0.20. However, the MACD suggests sellers have the upper hand. Bittensor (TAO) Price Analysis Bittensor (TAO) dropped 10% on Friday (May 23), slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $419. The price recovered on Saturday, rising 2.45% to $430, and registered a marginal increase on Sunday to end the weekend at $431. TAO raced to an intraday high of $464 on Monday. However, it could not stay at this level and ultimately settled at $434, registering a marginal increase. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as TAO rose over 3% to cross the 20-day SMA and settle at $448. Source: TradingView TAO was back in bearish territory on Wednesday, falling over 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA, and settling at $434. Sellers retained control on Thursday as the price fell over 4% to $416. Selling pressure intensified on Friday as TAO fell nearly 10%, slipping below $400 and the 200-day SMA settling at $376. Despite the selling pressure, TAO recovered on Saturday, surging over 14% to reclaim $400 and settle at $430. However, it lost momentum after failing to cross the 20-day SMA and fell nearly 4% on Sunday, ultimately settling at $413. The current session sees the price down over 1%, trading around $400. Sellers will look to retain control and drive TAO below $400. On the other hand, buyers will look to regain control and push the price above the 20-day SMA towards $500.

2025-06-02T13:11:53,"Important Shiba Inu Indicator Drops to a 3-Month Low: How Will SHIB’s Price React?","TL;DR Shibarium’s recent slowdown has sparked concerns over Shiba Inu’s network engagement and price outlook. However, a negative exchange netflow and a low RSI hint at potential recovery signs. Brace for Impact? The number of daily transactions processed on Shiba Inu’s layer-2 blockchain solution, Shibarium, has been in decline over the past few weeks. On June 1, the figure shrank to just 65,411, marking the lowest point observed in nearly three months. Additionally, the number of active accounts and new contracts has also headed south. The aforementioned data indicate stalled activity on the network, suggesting reduced user engagement, which may have a negative influence on the price. Some members of the Shiba Inu team, as well as other industry participants, believe the future development of Shibarium is vital for the meme coin’s price performance. One of those is the Bitcoin advocate Jeremie Davinci, who recently said: “I like Shiba Inu, as you know, and I think it will do relatively well in this cycle, but it may not go as high as you expect. I think Shiba Inu has a lot of utility now that they have Shibarium, and basically , it’s a chain that you can actually run all kinds of applications. However, nobody is using it, and there are no applications for using your tokens on Shibarium yet . If they get that solved, Shiba Inu will go to the moon.” Another factor signaling bad news for SHIB’s valuation is the project’s burning mechanism. Over the past seven days, the team and community have destroyed approximately 111 million tokens, representing a 15% decline compared to the rate witnessed the week before. Furthermore, only 1.57 million SHIB were burned in the past 24 hours, meaning a nearly 90% decrease on a daily scale. The program’s ultimate goal is to reduce the overall supply of the meme coin and potentially increase its value through scarcity. According to Shibburn, the amount of tokens burned from the initial supply since adopting the program is over 410.7 trillion, leaving 584.4 trillion in circulation. Some Bullish Signs Although the aforementioned signs imply a bearish future for Shiba Inu, other factors paint a more positive picture. For instance, SHIB’s exchange netflow has been predominantly negative over the past week, indicating that the coin’s supply on centralized platforms is decreasing. This suggests that investors may have shifted toward self-custody methods, a move that reduces immediate selling pressure. SHIB Exchange Netflow, Source: CryptoQuant Shiba Inu’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also worth mentioning. The momentum oscillator is currently hovering slightly above the bullish zone of 30. Ratios below that level typically indicate that the meme coin may be oversold and poised for a rally. On the contrary, anything above 70 may be taken as a warning signal.

2025-06-02T13:05:01,"UK-based IG Group rolls out crypto trading for retail investors","IG Group has introduced crypto trading services targeting retail investors. The London-listed trading and financial offerings firm said retail investors can trade up to 31 crypto assets. IG Group stated that crypto investors can trade digital assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, certain meme coins, altcoins, and XRP. IG Group, a London-listed financial services firm, has launched spot crypto trading. The company said the new trading services will benefit retail investors. IG Group revealed that the new offering will expand its current contrast for differences (CDFs) services. The firm said retail investors will be able to trade 31 digital assets, such as XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum. IG Group also revealed that traders can also access certain meme coins and altcoins. IG Group partners with Uphold to offer spot trading IG Group said Uphold Exchange will offer infrastructure and compliance. According to its website, Uphold is regulated in both the UK and the US. IG Group said Uphold will offer pricing data for the digital assets. The London-listed company also revealed that Uphold will manage all crypto transactions made by retail investors on the platform. IG Group said Uphold, the US-based company, will also act as the custodian for the crypto assets held by the retail investors. The UK-listed firm said the new crypto trading services will be offered across the IG Invest app and the IG platform. IG Group added that retail customers can switch from digital assets accounts to other user accounts, including stock trading. The company reiterated that the Financial Services Compensation Scheme will not cover digital assets held with the US-listed firm. IG Group also said the spot trading offerings will be limited to fully paid trading positions with no leverage. Michael Healy, the Managing Director of IG Group, said introducing crypto trading for retail investors in the UK was a major milestone for the country. Healy also said launching crypto trading in the country was a huge moment for the company. The managing director said UK retail consumers will henceforth buy, sell, and hold crypto assets with an established business. Healy said that customer demand in the UK is nearing a tipping point. The MD explained that traditional account holders want direct exposure to crypto options such as Ethereum and Bitcoin. Healy added that retail investors want exposure to a growing list of altcoins such as Dogecoin, Solana, and the meme token DogWifhat. The UK shows progress in digital assets regulations IG Group launched a new crypto offering five weeks after the UK Treasury published guidelines to bring digital assets under existing consumer protection, market abuse, and capital regimes. Rachel Reeves, the Chancellor of the United Kingdom, said the new requirement would boost investor confidence. According to a survey by the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (UK FCA) published in August 2024, 12% of adults in the UK already owned crypto assets, up from 4.4% in 2021. About 93% of consumers were aware of crypto assets. Many respondents opted for cryptocurrencies as part of their wider investment portfolio. In early 2021, IG Group stopped offering retail digital assets services after the UK FCA temporarily banned crypto derivatives. On May 28, the UK FCA announced a public consultation on proposed new guidelines targeting stablecoin issuers and digital assets custody providers. In April, the UK government released general guidelines for digital assets like Ethereum. The government said the draft regulations aimed to protect digital asset investors from potentially risky investors and scams. A report by Gemini revealed that digital asset adoption in the UK was booming. The report showed that the UK saw a massive hike in new digital asset owners in the last year, outpacing Europe. About 49% of UK respondents said clearer crypto regulations would help promote trust. Roughly 38% of UK consumers without digital assets revealed that regulatory uncertainty was the main barrier to crypto buying. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-06-02T13:00:08,"$3 XRP Dream Delayed—No Bull Run Before November, Says Top Analyst","The daily XRP chart has slipped back into a state of suspended animation just when bulls needed decisive follow-through, according to the Ichimoku-centric assessment shared by crypto strategist Dr Cat (@DoctorCatX). “I would be surprised to see $3, let alone ATH in June,” the analyst wrote after posting the chart, lamenting that “the window of opportunity was missed” for both the dollar and Bitcoin pairs. XRP Bulls Miss Their Shot The chart Dr Cat circulated shows XRP-USD grinding along the lower edge of the kumo around $2.14 after a failed attempt to reclaim the flat Kijun-sen that has flattened near $2.35. Price action pierced the cloud top in early May on robust volume, but follow-through stalled and the token has now printed two consecutive closes back inside the cloud. The Tenkan-sen has curled beneath the Kijun-sen, signalling waning short-term momentum, while the Chikou span (lagging line) is trapped in overlapping candles—classic signs of neutrality rather than outright weakness, yet miles away from the bullish alignment required for an explosive trend. Dr Cat argues that Ichimoku bull markets do not emerge spontaneously; they “take a lot of time and effort,” typically at least one full 26-period rotation, to rebuild after a failed attack. “If the window of opportunity is missed and these conditions are not utilized, it’s not a good sign,” he cautioned, adding that the most optimistic scenario now implies “at least 1 standard 26-candles cycle to retry.” On a daily chart that translates to roughly a month, leaving any breakout attempt realistically postponed to July or August and, if momentum continues to lag, potentially November. Related Reading: XRP Multi-Timeframe Breakdown: Here’s What Comes Next Lower-timeframe data paint a harsher picture. The analyst points to “consistent selling pressure on lower medium timeframes without any sign of strength,” noting that XRP/BTC has sunk to the 2041-satoshi monthly support and is failing to bounce. The 2041 level—the exact value where the cloud thins dramatically later in the year—has become the fulcrum for Dr Cat’s broader thesis: if it holds through summer, the token could launch a thinner-cloud break in November when “the XRPBTC kumo is very thin and easy to break.” The medium-term stakes are clear on the weekly template, where Dr Cat says “there is nothing bullish.” The weekly kumo is widening in front of price, while the Tenkan-Kijun bear cross remains unresolved. Because trend-following traders typically want to see candle bodies and the Chikou span clear both the cloud and historical price structure, the current setup offers few immediate catalysts. Even so, the monthly view retains a more constructive look on the USD pair—a reminder that secular strength is not altogether lost, merely dormant. In the near term, the analyst sees a real danger of cascading toward $1.89, a price zone that coincides with the flat bottom of April’s cloud twist and a visible shelf of historical volume accumulation. Should that level give way, the chart offers scant support until the $1.70 region where the March spike tail began. Related Reading: XRP Set To Explode—But Only After This Plunge, Analyst Says Despite the downbeat tone Dr Cat stops short of declaring a bear market. “The good news is that 3D is still NOT ready to trend bearish at all on the USD pair,” he wrote, underscoring that closing prices have not yet delivered a decisive shift below the three-day Kijun-sen. If the token can hold cloud support into July, another push toward the upper cloud boundary near $2.40 could materialise. Only a clean break above that level, accompanied by a bullish Tenkan-Kijun cross and a Chikou span that punches above historical price, would force a reassessment of the $3 ceiling before year-end. For now, however, the roadmap remains one of patience. “All in all, my most bullish case expectation for June is neutral price action below ATH,” Dr Cat reiterated, positioning November—when the cloud on the XRP/BTC pair narrows to its thinnest width in years—as the next credible launch window. Until then, traders eyeing a resurgence must watch that 2041-satoshi floor and be prepared for several more weeks of sideways drift—or a sudden downside probe toward $1.89—before the larger trend declares its verdict. At press time, XRP traded at $2.17.

2025-06-02T13:00:00,"Bitcoin And The Paradox Of Overvaluation","Summary The difference between Bitcoin’s actual price and the price that the majority of market participants think that it should be is explained by something I call the paradox of overvaluation. This dynamic is more extreme for Bitcoin than other assets. Bitcoin’s price can remain high as long as the optimistic fringe continues to buy and hold. To succeed as an investor, you must understand the paradox of overvaluation and implement appropriate strategies. Traditional value investing is less effective in today’s markets. For over 15 years, the price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has continued to rise despite the fact that the majority of people believe that the cryptocurrency is severely overvalued. This difference between what the majority of people think should be the value of Bitcoin and its actual price is a clear example of a phenomenon which I refer to as “the paradox of overvaluation.” In my previous article entitled “ The Paradox of Market Overvaluation ,” which I highly recommend that everybody read, I demonstrated in detail why it is that the average investor always believes that the S&P 500 is overvalued --- regardless of whether its PE ratio is higher than 20 (as it is now) or less than 10 (as it was in the 1970s). In this article, I will explain how the “paradox of overvaluation” has consistently defied majority opinion for over 15 years. The Market is Not a Voting Machine Benjamin Graham famously said that the market was like a “voting machine.” This implies that prices reflect the opinion of the majority of market participants. The Efficient Market Hypothesis [EMH] is also commonly interpreted to suggest that the market is a kind of aggregator of the opinions of all market participants. Based on these and other popular theories, most people seem to believe (or intuit) that the market price should reflect the average, weighted average or consensus opinion of market participants. These beliefs and intuitions are wrong. As I explain in great detail in this video entitled, “ The Stock Market is Not A Voting Machine ,” the stock market is not a voting machine nor an aggregator of market opinions. The market is a double auction mechanism. And in this specific type of auction, the shares of stock that are offered by sellers are always awarded to the highest bidder. Therefore, the market price reflects valuation of the highest bidder (the marginal buyer). The Market Price Always Reflects Extreme Optimism Now, at this point we should pause and reflect on what sort of opinion is implicitly reflected by the valuation that was paid by the highest bidder. We know one very important thing about this implicit opinion: That is extremely optimistic relative to the opinions of the majority of market participants. Now, some may ask: How do you know this? We know this since the shares of common stock of any given company are generally owned by a very small percentage of all market participants (generally less than 1%). It follows, therefore, that the valuation paid by the highest bidder (the marginal buyer) reflects the opinion of an extreme optimistic fringe among market participants. Now some may want to question my claim that the valuation paid by the highest bidder actually represents an extremely optimistic opinion (relative to all other market participants) about the value of the shares. Some might say, “some buyers such as momentum traders or passive index funds don’t care about valuation at all.” This is true. But the price still implicitly reflects the opinion of an optimistic fringe. Why? Because in order to buy the shares, the value-insensitive trader had to outbid a value-sensitive trader that did have an extremely optimistic opinion (relative to all other market participants) regarding the value of those shares. Therefore, it is accurate to say that the market price (the price paid by the highest bidder) represents an extremely optimistic relative opinion regarding the value of those shares. Indeed, it is accurate to say that the market price reflects the opinion of an “optimistic fringe” among all market participants. This is the essence of what I call “the paradox of overvaluation.” The market price of the shares of every company that trades on the stock market always seems to be overvalued in the eyes of the majority of market participants. This is not is not speculation or conjecture. This is an iron law of microeconomics and it is as true as any scientific law. Indeed, this is a truth that is so certain that it does not need to be proved empirically, because it is true by virtue of logical necessity. The Paradox of Overvaluation Applied to Bitcoin By virtue of the principles that we have just outlined, we can say with complete confidence that the valuation paid by the highest bidder (including any value insensitive trader) implicitly reflects an extremely optimistic opinion regarding the valuation of the shares. The same exact principle applies to most other assets, and it definitely applies to Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin has always and will always reflect the opinion of an “optimistic fringe” of market participants. This insight is the key to understanding why it is that the price of Bitcoin has consistently defied the opinions of the majority of market participants for over 15 years. This basic principle – that the price of Bitcoin reflects the opinions of an “optimistic fringe” is as true today with Bitcoin near an all-time high, as it was in late 2022 when Bitcoin was in the midst of an excruciating bear market that saw its price cut by more than two-thirds. With Bitcoin near an all-time high today, most market participants think that Bitcoin is overvalued. But in 2022, the majority of market participants – potentially an even greater majority – thought that Bitcoin was overvalued. Once you understand this fundamental fact – that the price of Bitcoin will always reflect the opinions of an optimistic fringe – it will most likely revolutionize how you think about Bitcoin. Implications for the Price of Bitcoin When we say that the price of Bitcoin will always reflect the opinions of an optimistic fringe of market participants, this statement has more significance than when we say it regarding almost any other asset. This is because the optimistic fringe of market participants when it comes to Bitcoin is fanatical fringe, like no other group that participates in financial markets. Promoters of Bitcoin have managed to create an ideology of HODLing which is conducive to fanaticism since it is not based on any sort of measurable economic fundamentals. It is an ideology which is based on unmeasurable and unquantifiable assertions. Any and all claims that are said to support Bitcoin’s value are fundamentally indeterminate and epistemically non-falsifiable. Bitcoin is not like a stock that can have a quarter in which their earnings are disappointing. Bitcoin has no earnings nor any basis for quantifiable fundamental value that can “disappoint” its followers. And as long as Bitcoin owners and potential buyers are satisfied with this state of affairs, then Bitcoin’s price can continue to remain extremely high relative to its intrinsic valuation as estimated by skeptics. The fact that Bitcoin has virtually no fundamental characteristics that can serve as reference points for value is very important. It enables Bitcoin fans to assign any value to Bitcoin that they want. With stocks, price cannot exceed earnings by a multiple that is too high. With Bitcoin, there is no earnings and no equivalent that can serve as a constraint on the value that is assigned to it by the optimistic fringe – to the upside or the downside. The Outlook for Bitcoin The bullish case for Bitcoin is that more and more people and/or institutions will “adopt” BTC as a currency and/or as a sort of “digital gold”. Given that its supply is fixed at a maximum of 21 million bitcoins, adding adopters will tend to drive up the price. This is because new adopters have to bid high enough to entice current Bitcoin holders to part with their BTC. The bearish case for Bitcoin is that some event will happen, that will cause the optimistic fringe of Bitcoin owners to change their minds about their value and lower their reservation prices. A reservation price is the lowest price that a holder of an asset is willing to sell at. There is a third possible scenario: This would be a situation in which Bitcoin trades sideways. This could occur if two things occur simultaneously. First, the ability of the Bitcoin narrative to attract significant amounts of new investment from marginal buyers has “peaked.” Second, relatively few current holders will change their minds about the value of Bitcoin and decide to sell. In my view, contrary to what bulls and bears think, the “sideways” is quite plausible given that most of the arguments for and against Bitcoin have been completely aired out and it is relatively unlikely that there will be any material new developments that can add substantially to the bullish or the bearish narratives that might influence the optimistic fringe. Again, it is important to understand in this regard that Bitcoin is not like a stock where earnings or dividends can rise or fall, providing fresh new reasons for the optimistic fringe to change their assessments of valuation. With Bitcoin, bulls and bears could be rehashing the same exact arguments for years, with no major new developments to bolster the arguments of one side or another. Conclusion Most observers of financial markets expect that the market price of an asset will reflect the opinion of the majority of market participants. This expectation is false. Assets are always held by the market participants that value them most highly. This basic insight is especially consequential in the case of Bitcoin. This is because the market participants that value Bitcoin most highly constitute a fanatically optimistic fringe of opinion that is like no other in financial markets. As a result, the valuation of Bitcoin is far higher than the valuation estimated by the average market participant. This is a good example of what I call the “overvaluation paradox.” The market price is always higher than the majority of market participants think it should be. However, in the case of Bitcoin, this divergence between the market price and what the majority thinks the market price should be is particularly extreme. This has a clear explanation. The price of an asset in limited supply always reflects the opinions regarding the value of that asset of an optimistic fringe of market participants. In the case of Bitcoin, opinions on the value of this asset are far more polarized than with almost any other asset. The optimistic fringe regarding the value of Bitcoin thinks that Bitcoin should be worth multiple times more than its current price. Bitcoin skeptics believe that BTC has zero or near-zero value. This wide divergence is enabled by the fact that the optimistic fringe of Bitcoin fans has not anchored their valuations of Bitcoin to any serious quantifiable thesis. The value of Bitcoin could be $1,000 or $1,000,000 and there is very little that can economically arbitrate between these alternatives. Therefore, the value of Bitcoin becomes a matter of subjective opinion that is almost completely unhinged from any quantifiable fundamental argument that could justify it. Due to the limited supply of Bitcoin, as long as an optimistic fringe of market participants is willing to buy and hold Bitcoin at high values (e.g. more than $100,00) and to do so indefinitely, then the value of Bitcoin will remain high – even if the vast majority of people in the world think that market value of Bitcoin is ridiculous. I personally believe that Bitcoin is intrinsically worth virtually nothing. I don’t believe it will ever be adopted widely as money. And I don’t believe that it will be a reliable long-term store of purchasing power (as gold has been for thousands of years). Most importantly, I believe that any valuable economic services that Bitcoin provides can be provided with equal or greater efficiency by substitutes. However, I also understand this very clearly: My opinion about the fundamental value of Bitcoin does not ultimately matter. The only opinions that matter are those of the small minority of people that are willing to trade and hold those 21 million Bitcoins. As long as those people believe that Bitcoin is worth $100,000 or more, then its market price will continue to trade above $100,000. A key takeaway is that there is absolutely no contradiction when I say that Bitcoin is worth virtually nothing in terms of fundamental economic value and when I say that Bitcoin’s price can and probably will go higher. I base the former opinion on my knowledge of economic fundamentals. I base the latter opinion on my observation of the psychological and social dynamics that motivate the optimistic fringe of market participants in relation to Bitcoin. I think it is useful to think of the psychological and social dynamics that motivate the growth in Bitcoin adoption (which drives the growth of its price) the way one would objectively evaluate the prospects for the spread of a religion. For example. You might vehemently disagree with the fundamentals of a certain proselytist religion – let’s say Mormonism. But it is possible to objectively understand the psychological and social dynamics that have caused this religion to grow throughout the world. Every new convert to the “cult of Bitcoin” becomes a new source of marginal demand. Every convert is a new bidder at the auction that is motivated to buy regardless of price. It makes absolutely no difference if the majority think that the price that the new convert pays for Bitcoin makes any economic sense. The reality is that if a new convert wants to own some Bitcoin, they have to bid high enough to cause another fanatical Bitcoin optimist to part with their Bitcoin. Once you have understood Bitcoin in this way, you will comprehend that your superior understanding of the economic fundamentals of this asset can cause you to lose a great deal of money. To understand what the price of Bitcoin might do, you need to understand the principles of price formation. Final Thoughts If you want to succeed as an investor, it is critical that you understand the “paradox of overvaluation,” and that you acquire training in the the microeconomic principles that explain it. We no longer live in the world where value investors such as Ben Graham and Warren Buffet made their fortunes. For over a century, investors could find many US stocks that were intrinsically undervalued or at fair value. In such an environment, the strategy of “buy and hold,” can work well. The problem is that we now live in a world in which almost everything is intrinsically overvalued and there will only sporadically be opportunities to buy stocks in the US (and elsewhere in the world) at prices that will enable a good return, on a risk-adjusted basis. This means that portfolio management needs to be done very differently than it was until just a few years ago. At Successful Portfolio Strategy , we manage our portfolio with a philosophy of exploiting rare opportunities (e.g. macro-driven market crashes) and greatly expanding the scope of our search for good investment opportunities. In this regard, we think that 2025 is going to provide investors with some very good, but relatively unconventional opportunities. Short and long volatility strategies, international stocks, TIPS and combination trades are just a few examples of the sorts of things we have worked with in our portfolios in 2025.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4791557-bitcoin-and-the-paradox-of-overvaluation?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","BTC|SPY|SP500|SPX|DIA|DJI|COMP:IND|QQQ|NDX|GBTC|IBIT|BITO|FBTC|ARKB|BITB|BKCH|BITS|MARA|BTC-USD",cryptocompare

2025-06-02T12:58:45,"Strategy: Bitcoin Recovery Creates Less Risk (Rating Upgrade)","Summary Strategy continues aggressive Bitcoin accumulation, funding purchases through share offerings and preferred stock. Bitcoin's recent rally has kept Strategy's share price resilient. Bitcoin in May reached a new all-time high at ~$112,000. Strategy highly leveraged, debt-financed Bitcoin strategy poses significant risks if Bitcoin's price unexpectedly declines. Despite Bitcoin's upside potential, Strategy's valuation remains stretched and there are better ways for investors to invest in the world's biggest digital currency. Given Bitcoin's recovery to new all-time highs and a more moderate premium to book value, I am up-grading shares of MSTR to hold. Strategy ( MSTR ), which changed its name from MicroStrategy in February, is continuing to offer new shares through its at-the-market offering program in order to raise cash for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) purchases. Strategy acquired another 26,695 Bitcoins since the beginning of May which is when the largest corporate Bitcoin owner in the world submitted its first-quarter earnings sheet that widely missed consensus estimates. Bitcoin itself, however, has seen a nice recovery rally lately, up to $112,000 which is where the digital currency marked a new all-time high. With Bitcoin interest set to only increase going forward due to institutional adoption, I believe Bitcoin’s price surge limits the risks of an investment in Strategy. Data by YCharts Previous rating I rated shares of Strategy a strong sell in my last work on the business intelligence company -- A Dangerous Gamble -- chiefly because I was concerned about the firm’s high valuation relative to the Bitcoin price. Simply put, investors in Bitcoin have a much more straightforward approach to investing in Bitcoin which is to own the digital currency outright. I am still not a big fan of Strategy given its relatively irrelevant underlying intelligence business, but the resilience and recent recovery of the Bitcoin price cause me to change my stock rating to hold. Debt-financed Bitcoin transactions Strategy continues to raise debt to finance Bitcoin purchases and since the company submitted its first-quarter earnings report on May 1, 2025, it has spend millions more on BTC. The Bitcoin company generated a loss of $16.53 per-share in adjusted earnings in the first-quarter, missing estimates by a mile. The decline in earnings was chiefly attributable due to negative changes in the Bitcoin digital currency price in the first-quarter. Revenues slightly missed, by $5.3M, and came in at $111.1M. Seeking Alpha Strategy suffered in the first-quarter from a correction in the Bitcoin price which led to a $5.9B impairment shown as part of the company's operating expenses. It should be noted that this is an unrealized fair value loss that is the result of Strategy switching to fair value accounting in Q1'25. However, since Strategy said that it wants to be a long term holder of Bitcoin, it is unlikely that the company will ultimately recognize a loss on its Bitcoin holdings. Strategy Strategy has aggressively escalated its strategy of purchasing Bitcoin through the issuance of convertible debt as well as shares in the last several years: this year alone, the company acquired 132,780 Bitcoins -- in the period from January 1, 2025 through to May 26, 2025 and Strategy now owns almost 3% of the outstanding supply of all Bitcoins. MicroStrategy The company has said that it plans to conduct more debt-financed Bitcoin acquisitions this year as well as in the years ahead. The recent purchases have been financed by a combination of at-the-market share offerings, including preferred stock. The most recent batch of 4,020 Bitcoins was funded by $427M in combined capital raises and allowed the company to bring its total BTC holdings to a massive 580,250 valued at $60.4B. Strategy Strategy also raised its overall debt levels, mostly through the issuance of convertible debt, in the last 3 years in order to finance additional Bitcoin investments. As of the end of the first-quarter, Strategy was a significantly more leveraged Bitcoin bet than in the year-earlier period. In Q1'25, Strategy's book value surged to $32.2B while its long-term debt increased by about $1.0B Q/Q to $8.1B. Data by YCharts Strategy’s valuation I was very concerned about Strategy’s implied Bitcoin premium in my last work on the business intelligence company, especially considering that Strategy's underlying software business is really not that impressive. Shares of Strategy still trade at a considerable premium to book value (as well as the implied Bitcoin price), however: investors currently pay 3.2X the company's underlying GAAP book value (which is $121 per-share), but the firm has been massively more expensive in the past, especially during periods of surging investor optimism about the prospect for digital currency price appreciation... which tended to coincide with period of Bitcoin making new highs. This hype has died down a little bit lately, but shares of Strategy are clearly no bargain either, especially not for investors that have other routes to buy into the world's number one digital currency. The 3-year average P/B ratio for Strategy is 8.5X, so shares today are significantly cheaper, on a book value basis, than in the past which is the main reason why I am adjusting my rating for the corporate Bitcoin investor to hold. Data by YCharts Investors that look for direct exposure to Bitcoin can either buy the digital currency directly or gain BTC exposure through a vehicle like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ). The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF is one of the largest of its kind and was the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded product available to public investors. Today, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF owns about 185,682 Bitcoins worth approximately $19.4B. Risks with Strategy The biggest risk for Strategy is obviously that the company is running a highly-leveraged Bitcoin investment strategy that could inflict serious mark-to-market losses in case the Bitcoin price unexpectedly tanks. This could drastically skew the company’s earnings results, but would not necessarily affect Strategy’s cash flow as the company has said it plans to be a long term owner of the world’s largest digital currency. What would change my rating on Strategy is if the difference to book value and market price narrowed in which case I may upgrade shares to buy. Final thoughts Strategy is still very highly valued with a price-to-book ratio above 3.0X and investors therefore continue to pay an high premium to the company’s implied Bitcoin holdings. Strategy continued to buy back thousands more Bitcoins since it released its first-quarter earnings, but the company has also seen a significant increase in its leverage profile as a result. While I believe that shares of Strategy are not yet competitively priced, I believe the risk profile has improved lately as the Bitcoin price has seen a massive recovery and even touched on new highs briefly.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4791660-strategy-bitcoin-recovery-creates-less-risk-rating-upgrade?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX","MSTR",cryptocompare

2025-06-02T12:50:13,"Crucial Bitcoin Price Test: Key Level Could Define Next Bull Market Phase","BitcoinWorld Crucial Bitcoin Price Test: Key Level Could Define Next Bull Market Phase The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation as the Bitcoin price approaches a critical juncture. After a significant rally, the leading digital asset is now navigating a technical and psychological landscape that analysts believe could set the stage for its next major move. Understanding this key level is paramount for anyone tracking the current bull market trajectory. Why This Bitcoin Price Level Matters Now According to Rachael Lucas, a seasoned crypto analysis expert at BTC Markets, in comments shared with The Block, Bitcoin is currently positioned at a pivotal point. This isn’t just another number on a chart; it represents a confluence of factors that traders and investors are watching closely. The market is digesting recent gains, and how Bitcoin behaves here will provide strong clues about the immediate future. Lucas specifically highlighted the importance of certain technical indicators. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) are tools used by analysts to gauge the momentum and potential trend changes in an asset’s price. Both indicators, while still suggesting a generally constructive long-term outlook, have shown signs that the intense bullish momentum seen previously might be slowing down. This doesn’t necessarily mean a reversal is imminent, but it signals a potential pause or consolidation phase, which is typical at significant price hurdles. What Are the Key Levels to Watch for BTC Price? Based on the analysis, the crucial support zone lies between $103,000 and $105,000. This range is acting as a significant battleground between buyers and sellers. Holding above this area is seen as a highly positive sign. Why? Because maintaining support here would demonstrate continued buying pressure and market strength, providing a solid base for further upward movement. If Bitcoin successfully defends this $103,000 to $105,000 range, the path could open up towards the next significant resistance level, potentially around $115,000. Reaching $115,000 would represent a strong continuation of the bull market , potentially attracting more capital and reinforcing positive sentiment across the market. However, markets are dynamic, and the possibility of a pullback cannot be ignored. If Bitcoin fails to hold the $103,000 to $105,000 support zone, a retracement could occur. The analysis suggests that a potential downside target in such a scenario could be between $93,000 and $97,000. This level would then become the next critical area for buyers to step in and prevent further declines. Understanding the Technical Indicators: RSI and MACD in Crypto Analysis Let’s take a moment to understand the tools mentioned in the crypto analysis . These indicators provide valuable insights into market dynamics: Relative Strength Index (RSI): This is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates between zero and 100. Traditionally, readings above 70 indicate an asset is overbought (potentially due for a pullback), while readings below 30 suggest it is oversold (potentially due for a bounce). When the RSI starts to trend downwards from high levels, even as the price continues to rise or consolidate, it can signal weakening momentum or potential divergence, which is what Lucas is likely observing. Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD): This is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of an asset’s price. It consists of the MACD line, the signal line, and the histogram. Crossovers between the MACD line and the signal line, as well as the position of the histogram relative to the zero line, are used to identify potential buy and sell signals. A narrowing or downward turn in the MACD lines or a shrinking histogram can indicate slowing bullish momentum. While these indicators are powerful tools in crypto analysis , they are not foolproof and should always be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis, including looking at price action, volume, and fundamental factors. Is a Pullback a Sign the Bull Market is Over? A crucial point emphasized in the analysis is that a potential drop to the $93,000-$97,000 range would likely represent a temporary pause rather than a complete reversal of the broader market rally. This is a key distinction. In a healthy bull market , price corrections and pullbacks are normal and even necessary. They allow the market to cool down, shake out weaker hands, and provide opportunities for new capital to enter at slightly lower prices. Such a move would be seen as a consolidation phase within an ongoing uptrend, not the start of a bear market. The long-term outlook, despite the signs of slowing momentum, remains constructive. This suggests that the underlying fundamental drivers for Bitcoin’s growth – such as increasing institutional adoption, limited supply, macroeconomic factors like inflation hedging, and ongoing development in the ecosystem – are still largely positive. A temporary dip would likely be viewed by long-term holders and institutions as a buying opportunity. Navigating the Current Bitcoin Price Environment: What Should Investors Consider? Given the current situation at this key level , what steps might investors and traders consider? Here are a few points based on the crypto analysis : Monitor the $103,000 – $105,000 Support: This is the immediate line in the sand. Watching how the Bitcoin price reacts around this level is crucial. A strong bounce could signal continuation upwards. Observe Volume: Significant price moves, either up or down, accompanied by high trading volume are typically more convincing than moves on low volume. Pay attention to volume as the price approaches the key levels. Watch Technical Indicators: Keep an eye on the RSI and MACD, as well as other indicators you may use. Look for signs of momentum picking up again or continuing to wane. Consider Risk Management: In times of uncertainty around key levels, having a risk management strategy is vital. This could involve setting stop-losses or adjusting position sizes based on your risk tolerance and market outlook. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of broader market news, macroeconomic data, and developments specific to the crypto space that could influence the BTC price . This period requires careful observation rather than impulsive decisions. The market is poised, and patience is key as it decides its next direction from this key level . Historical Context: Bitcoin’s Behavior at Past Key Levels Looking back at previous Bitcoin cycles can offer valuable perspective. Bitcoin has a history of consolidating or pulling back after significant price surges, often around psychological round numbers or technical resistance levels. These periods of consolidation are often necessary before the price can break higher. For example, during previous bull runs, tests of key moving averages or previous all-time highs often led to temporary pullbacks before the uptrend resumed with renewed strength. The current situation around the $100,000+ mark and the specific $103,000-$105,000 range could be seen as a similar test of conviction and market structure within the ongoing bull market . The Road Ahead for the Bitcoin Bull Market While short-term volatility is always possible, the underlying narrative for Bitcoin remains compelling for many. Factors such as increasing institutional adoption through products like spot ETFs, growing awareness of Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation and currency debasement, and the upcoming supply reduction events continue to provide a foundation for long-term growth. The current test at this key level is a normal part of a market cycle. How Bitcoin navigates it will likely determine the speed and magnitude of the next leg up, but it doesn’t necessarily signal the end of the broader bull market trend. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for the Bitcoin Price In summary, the Bitcoin price is currently facing a defining moment at a critical key level identified by experts through careful crypto analysis . The $103,000 to $105,000 range is acting as a pivotal support. Holding this level could propel Bitcoin towards $115,000, extending the current bull market phase. Conversely, a drop below this range might trigger a temporary pullback towards $93,000-$97,000. Technical indicators like RSI and MACD suggest a potential cooling of momentum, but the overall long-term outlook remains positive. Investors should monitor these levels closely, understand the potential scenarios, and employ sound risk management strategies. This period of consolidation and testing is a natural part of a healthy market cycle and will likely determine the immediate path forward for the BTC price .

Initially available over the counter to a limited pool of qualified investors, the bonds let holders earn based on two variables: the future performance of BTC in U.S. dollars and any strengthening of the dollar relative to the ruble. Investors can access these instruments without opening a crypto wallet or using foreign crypto exchanges, with all transactions being processed in rubles within Russia’s “legal and infrastructure systems.” The bank plans to list similar structured products with cryptocurrency exposure on the Moscow Exchange, according to a recent announcement . Sberbank, per the announcement, is also launching a bitcoin futures product via its SberInvestments platform on June 4, aligning with the launch of the product on the Moscow Exchange. The announcement comes just after the Bank of Russia said financial institutions in the country can offer cryptocurrency-linked instruments to qualified investors.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/02/russias-largest-bank-sberbank-launches-structured-bonds-tied-to-bitcoin,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET","Markets|Sberbank|Russia|Bitcoin|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-02T12:43:47,"Legal expert blasts ’biggest XRP lie’ of the year","Lawyer Bill Morgan has called out what he described as the biggest lie regarding XRP’s lack of perceived legal clarity. Morgan, a supporter of Ripple and XRP, was responding to an X user on June 1 who argued that XRP has no legal standing, lacks major institutional support, and plays no role in central bank digital currencies ( CBDCs ). He firmly rejected that claim, citing Judge Analisa Torres’s July 2023 ruling, which determined that XRP, as a digital asset, is not inherently a security. This is a lie. XRP has been found by a judge not itself to be a security. The SEC Appeal did not challenge that finding. To say XRP has no legal clarity is the biggest lie I have seen in crypto this year. https://t.co/6x1AycUxja — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 1, 2025 The ruling made a clear distinction: while Ripple’s institutional sales were deemed securities transactions, programmatic sales on exchanges were not. Although the SEC appealed parts of the decision in October 2024, it notably did not challenge the key finding that XRP is not a security. Morgan argued that this reinforces the view that XRP enjoys a level of judicial clarity that most other cryptocurrencies , like Bitcoin ( BTC ), do not. The case was not about a classification. Judges just decide the issues in the case. The case was about whether sales of XRP by Ripple were securities. Thanks to the Judge’s obiter it has legal clarity of a judge finding that XRP itself is not a security. — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 2, 2025 XRP’s strong legal standing He further emphasized that the judge’s commentary, known as obiter dicta, holds persuasive value in legal circles, giving XRP a stronger position in regulatory debates. “Dicta does provide a degree of legal clarity. It is persuasive authority and there is no finding to the contrary that XRP is a security. Also persuasive is the reasoning that led to the funding that XRP is not a security. It has more judicial clarity than Bitcoin which has none,” he said. Morgan also noted that this precedent offers XRP a more defined legal status than Bitcoin, which lacks a similar court ruling. For now, the case remains unresolved. Following Ripple’s partial victory, both parties are back in court awaiting settlement approval. The proposed deal would see Ripple pay $75 million of its $125 million fine, potentially forfeiting the remaining $50 million. However, the court rejected the proposed settlement, stating that the joint filing was procedurally flawed and lacked legal justification.

2025-06-02T12:40:04,"Bitcoin ETFs outperform gold ETFs, a first in 2025","US Bitcoin ETFs pulled in a massive $5.23 billion in May alone, while gold-backed ETFs hemorrhaged $1.58 billion in outflows. Institutional money seems to be shifting gears, spreading a loud message that Bitcoin is emerging as the hedge of choice. Bitcoin’s surge to an all-time high of $111,980 earlier this month was fueled not just by ETFs’ impressive inflow but by a mix of favorable regulatory signals. This included momentum on stablecoin legislation and intensifying concerns over US fiscal stability. Gold has still managed to surge by 27% on the year to date (YTD), while BTC is up by just 12% in the same period. BlackRock’s IBIT leads BTC ETFs surge According to reports, technical indicators like short-term Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) weakness are largely being shrugged off. This is because of institutional flows and wallet data, painting a clear picture that portfolio rotation is underway. May saw a pretty good run for Bitcoin ETFs as they reported just four days of outflow while printing green all the way around. On the other side, gold ETFs went off the roof at the beginning of the month, but fell sharply in mid-May before regaining speed in the second half. 🔥Bitcoin ETFs are beating gold — first time this year. 📊$5.25B flowed into BTC ETFs in May, while Gold ETFs lost $1.58B. The flippening isn’t just in price — it’s in trust.👊 pic.twitter.com/zSIr69pAUm — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) June 2, 2025 Data shows that BlackRock’s IBIT posted the largest weekly net inflow, bringing in $584 million, as its cumulative net inflow has now reached $48.57 billion. However, it was followed by Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF, which posted a weekly net inflow of $19.81 million, hitting its total inflow to $1.4 billion. Source: SoSoValue Meanwhile, trading days from May 27 to May 30 saw a total net outflow of $157 million from Bitcoin ETFs. The largest weekly net outflow came from the ARKB ETF, with around $282 million running off the funds. Skeptics are still in doubt Bitcoin also reacted in a similar way, as BTC price dropped by almost 5% in the past 7 days. Bitcoin is trading at an average price of $104,492 as of press time. Its 24-hour trading volume is up by 14% to stand at $40.5 billion. Gold price has posted a major uptick in 2025, XAU price, which started the year trading at around $2,650, went on to hit above $3,430 on May 6. The precious metal is trading at an average price of $3,349 at the press time. Analysts remain bullish on both gold and Bitcoin as top hedges against G7 currency debasement. Some argue that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature gives it an edge, especially when it comes to guarding against financial system risks. However, some skeptics remain unsure that BTC has fully matured into a “safe haven.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

2025-06-02T12:39:11,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC in Danger of Prolonged Correction After Recent Rejection","Bitcoin recently tapped into the $111K zone, sweeping buy-side liquidity before showing signs of rejection. As the market pauses after a strong rally, technical and on-chain indicators suggest a potential pullback or consolidation phase, with traders now eyeing key levels for the next move. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart BTC experienced a notable rejection from the $111K supply zone after capturing the buy-side liquidity above the January-February highs. This move triggered an immediate drop and initiated a correction, with current price action showing signs of potential continuation lower. The daily RSI has also cooled off and is now hovering around the neutral 50 zone, indicating a pause in momentum. The 100 and 200-day moving averages remain bullishly aligned below price (located in the $90K-$95K range), and there is a visible fair value gap (FVG) between $101K and $98K, which may act as a magnet for price in the short term, but can also act as a demand zone to push the asset higher after penetration. Yet, despite the rejection from the $111K level, the overall structure remains bullish with price still holding above the ascending trendline and moving averages. As long as the asset remains above the $91K demand zone, the buyers are still in control structurally. If the FVG gets filled and the reaction is strong, it could create a new higher low and set the stage for another attempt toward the $111K–$114K resistance zone. The 4-Hour Chart Zooming into the 4H chart, BTC has broken below the ascending channel that had guided price action since early April. The breakdown was followed by a rejection from the $108K zone, suggesting that previous support has now turned into resistance. Moreover, the RSI on this timeframe is slightly below 50, pointing to bearish momentum gaining ground. There is also a clear range forming between $102K and $108K, with the price oscillating within it after the initial sell-off. Short-term traders should pay close attention to the mid-range and the recent swing lows near $102K. A break below this level could trigger a sharper move toward the $100K support level. On the flip side, reclaiming the $108K mark could invalidate the short-term bearish setup and open the doors for a retest of the range high and possibly $111K again. However, as things stand, the market is likely to go through a deeper correction in the coming days. On-Chain Analysis Adjusted SOPR (30-day EMA) The 30-day exponential moving average of Bitcoin’s Adjusted SOPR (aSOPR) has been on the rise well above the 1.0 threshold, indicating that, on average, coins moving on-chain are doing so in profit. This generally reflects renewed investor confidence, as holders become more willing to sell at a profit rather than capitulate at a loss. Historically, sustained aSOPR values above 1.0 during uptrends support bullish continuation, especially when price corrections are shallow. However, the current reading also suggests the market is entering a more sensitive phase. When the aSOPR rises too aggressively, it often precedes local tops as short-term holders rush to realize profits. A healthy trend would see a slight aSOPR reset above 1.0, ideally aligning with a price pullback into a support zone, before the next leg up.

2025-06-02T12:38:52,"BITCOIN PRICE ANALYSIS & PREDICTION (June 2) – BTC Stays Above $103k After a Week Decline, Will This Level Hold?","Reaching a new milestone with an over 20% rally in six weeks, Bitcoin marked resistance and halted rallies due to bullish weakness. It initiated a drop and retraced slightly, looking for strong support to rebound. The month of April ended a bit rough for Bitcoin after recovering back to the recent top in a couple of weeks. It printed a new all-time high at $111,980 and lost some ground due to a rejection, looking weak daily. Over the weekend, Bitcoin managed to stay above the $103k level after experiencing a dramatic decline throughout the weekdays. That brought a small relief in the drop as it pushed an inch above the $105kl level. Today, being the first day of a new week, Bitcoin appears a bit weak due to a minor loss in the past hours. A further deduction could trigger more bleeding in the next few days before locating solid ground. If the last weekend level holds well, we may see more gains in the next few hours. So far, it has been an interesting ride for Bitcoin in the last two months. While it is still under a retracement, we can anticipate a bigger rally as soon as it finds firm support. Its market structure is still considered bullish from a long-term perspective despite the latest drop. BTC’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview A drop below $103k could slide the price to the $100,718 support level. Failure to bounce back could result in more bleeding to the $97,895 and $93,500 levels before regaining strength. Bitcoin currently trades near a sub-resistance level of $106,600. A push above it should bring us back to the $111,980 resistance before breaking higher to the $115k and $120k levels in no time. Key Resistance Levels: $106,600, $111,980, $120,000 Key Support Levels: $100,718, $97,895, $93,500 Spot Price: $105, 311 Trend: Bullish Volatility: Low Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-06-02T12:38:46,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Analyst Says $340,000 Is Possible If Bulls Hold This Zone","Bitcoin (BTC) is in a correction, trading at $103,993 after a 0.18% drop in the last 24 hours. Despite the recent high of $111,970, can Bitcoin regain momentum? Crypto analyst PlanD thinks so, but only if it holds a key support zone. PlanD says BTC could reach $340,000 if it holds above the $91,000-$100,000 range. His theory is based on a 3-year cup-and-handle formation—a classic bullish pattern where there’s a period of consolidation followed by a breakout. Bitcoin en geniş açılı analizlerimde 25.000$ seviyesinden 109.000$’a kadar olan yükselişi adım adım analiz ederek takip ettim,ardından 109.000$ zirvesinden %30’luk gelecek olan 76.000$’lık düzeltmeyi öngörüp yatırımcıları uyardık ve düşüş konusunda haklı çıktım şuanda … pic.twitter.com/fbqNo77e6I — PlanD (@cryptododo7) May 31, 2025 The collapse from $69,000 in 2021 to stabilization in March 2024 is the “cup,” and the recent consolidation below $112,000 is the “handle”. Bitcoin Chart Structure Supports a Bullish Reversal The current price action is a descending channel with lower highs and lows, typical of a consolidation phase. Key resistance is at the 50-period EMA near $105,292, which has been capping recent rallies. Fibonacci levels indicate critical zones—BTC is testing support at the 0.236 retracement level ($104,514), with a risk of dipping to $103,149 or lower if sellers regain control. Bitcoin Price Chart Source: Tradingview Candlestick signals, including spinning tops and shooting stars, indicate market indecision. The MACD histogram is negative, but the signal lines are converging, which may suggest that a potential reversal is approaching. The RSI is below 40, indicating a mildly oversold condition but not yet a clear reversal. What to Watch For bullish momentum to return, Bitcoin needs to break above the descending channel and close above $105,292, ideally with strong candlestick formations, such as engulfing patterns or three white soldiers. This could lead to $106,719-$107,682, followed by a larger rally. Key levels to watch: Support: $104,514, $103,149, $102,141 Resistance: $105,292, $106,040, $107,682 If Bitcoin holds above $91,000-$100,000, it could be the start of the move to $340,000 by 2025, according to PlanD. But if not, deeper corrections. With a $2 trillion market cap and 24-hour trading volume over $40 billion, volatility is key. Be nimble and watch for breakouts or breakdowns from this range.

2025-06-02T12:30:39,"Best Crypto Presale to Buy – Top Picks Before Exchange Listings Send Them Mooning","As investors prepare for the next bull cycle, they aggressively seek presale tokens that might explode once they reach big exchanges. This presale season holds great potential, with AI-powered protocols and Bitcoin-backed incentive schemes. At the same time, fast-moving initiatives like BlockDAG and BTC Bull are gaining significant support. These presales are more than just hype; they are supported by use cases, tokenomics, and investor demand, which may result in substantial upside before listings begin. Nexchain: Where AI Powers Everything. Nexchain is more than just a blockchain; it is a comprehensive AI-powered platform. Its smart contracts incorporate capabilities such as real-time automation, predictive modelling, and data optimization by combining decentralized protocols with built-in artificial intelligence. The tokenomics paradigm is similarly forward-thinking. Nexchain processes up to 400,000 TPS using a Hybrid Consensus technique that includes Proof-of-Stake and its own NEX AI engine. That’s not a theory; it’s already live on testnet, proving unparalleled scalability. Aside from speed, Nexchain stands out for its revenue-sharing approach. Users that store $NEX in non-custodial wallets earn a 10% share of all gas costs collected across the network. This daily passive revenue makes each token holder into an active participant in the network’s success. Nexchain is now in stage 16 of its presale, priced at $0.062, and has raised $3.4 million in USDT. With upcoming exchange listings and AI storylines dominating Web3, Nexchain is a strong contender for breakout success. BlockDAG: Momentum for Every Batch BlockDAG is moving quickly. Its objective is to achieve $600 million, which has already surpassed $273 million. In only one week, it raised $10 million. This is not a slow ascent. The presale is building up steam, batch by batch. Every fresh batch carries a greater price, yet customers continue to buy quickly. That explains a lot. The interest is high. People are closely monitoring this project since it is one of the best bets for the upcoming crypto bull run. BTC Bull: Riding the Bitcoin Surge Bitcoin’s excellent potential distinguishes BTC Bull Token from already active presales, as the project offers investors an alternative option to amass BTC. According to the project’s roadmap, everyone who holds BTCBULL via Best Wallet will be eligible for two BTC airdrops, which will be awarded when Bitcoin’s value rises. Pushing above $150,000 would trigger the first BTC airdrop, with a second wave slated after BTC reaches $200,000. BTCBULL’s unique rewards scheme based on Bitcoin’s performance allows it to expand rapidly during BTC bull runs, increasing the gains of its holders. Nexchain: The Smartest Crypto Presale to Buy in 2025 Nexchain stands out as the best investment among all current cryptocurrency presales. It’s not following trends; it’s laying the groundwork for scalable, AI-powered blockchain applications. Nexchain is designed for long-term utility and market relevance, boasting unrivaled speed, built-in AI infrastructure, and a fair revenue scheme. Early investors have time to participate before the price rises since Nexchain is just $0.062 in stage 16 and has raised $3.6 million. As listings approach and demand for AI cryptocurrency grows, Nexchain is one of the top presales to watch and buy in 2025.

2025-06-02T12:30:22,"Meme Coins Drive the Crypto Adoption Trend – The Best Presales That Could Do 1000x in 2025","Gemini recently reported that meme coins have been a key driver of global crypto adoption, and continue to lead the trend, potentially setting the stage for top presales in 2025 to deliver up to 1000x returns. The ‘Global State of Crypto’ report used data-driven insights from the crypto market and surveyed 7,205 crypto investors in the US, UK, France, Singapore, Australia, and Italy. One key finding reveals that up to 23% of U.S. crypto non-owners say Trump’s pro-crypto stance has boosted their interest and confidence in crypto. According to the same report, the rise in crypto ownership between 2024 and 2025 reinforces the growing pro-crypto narrative, further fueling investor interest. This context could fuel some of the best meme coins today, like Solaxy ($SOLX) , BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) , and MIND of Pepe ($MIND) as high as 1000x. Why Gemini’s Findings Could Fuel 2025’s Best Presales to 1000X According to Gemini’s report, much of the current crypto growth is due to the success of meme coins. ‘In the US, 31% of investors who own both meme coins and traditional cryptocurrencies report that they purchased their meme coins first, followed by 28% in Australia and the UK, 23% in Singapore, 22% in Italy, and 19% in France.’ —Team Gemini, Global State of Crypto, 2025 Report The investor interest is so high that almost a quarter of US crypto aficionados allocate 50% or more of their portfolio to meme coins . The findings don’t stop there, as the report has accounted for multiple metrics and produced just as many results. Some of these include: Only 15% of the US crypto investors sold assets over the past six months, a visible drop from 2024’s 17% 39% of the US investors view crypto as a hedge against inflation, compared to 2024’s 32% The number of female crypto investors increased from 28% to 32% in the US and from 30% to 33% in the UK Millennials lead the crypto race with 36% of them being owners and 16% past owners, compared with boomers, where 90% are non-owners 31% of the US crypto investors bought meme coins first, before investing in any other altcoins; 30% for Australia, and 28% for the UK 39% of the US crypto owners are in a crypto ETF in 2025, up from 37% in 2024 This data adds much-needed clarity and perspective, showing us that the crypto ecosystem is in full swing and that the genie is out of the lamp. We’re witnessing the financial sector taking a massive shift towards crypto, with public and private corporations taking the largest slices of the crypto pie . In this context, some of the best presales today could easily reach 1000x, given the right push and community support. As capital floods into the space and retail interest grows, investor attention quickly shifts toward high-upside opportunities beyond Bitcoin. This is where the best altcoins come into focus: innovative, early-stage projects with strong fundamentals and viral momentum. With the right market conditions, these top altcoins could ride the next wave of adoption and deliver outsized returns in 2025 and beyond. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana’s Layer 2 Update Coming with Higher Speeds and Lower Fees Solaxy ($SOLX) brings a much-needed set of updates to Solana’s ecosystem, targeting the network’s stability and performance issues. According to the project’s whitepaper , Solaxy aims to address Solana’s slow transaction speeds, failed transactions during network congestion, and its high fees due to poor blockchain performance. While $SOLX is essentially a meme coin, it’s also a utility-based token, supporting Solaxy’s development and, with time, the Solana ecosystem itself. The presale is nearing the end, with little over two weeks left, after accumulating over $43M so far. This means that you only have 14 days at your disposal to purchase $SOLX for the exclusive price of $0.001742, before the project goes live. This is especially important if we consider the project’s long-term utility, which, we predict, will pump the token’s value considerably over the following years. Our analysts predict a price point of $0.032 for $SOLX by the end of 2025 following the launch of the Layer 2 network. This will deliver an ROI of 1,736% if you buy at today’s price. A $100 investment for raw numbers will turn into $1,836 by the end of the year. Wait until 2026, and things will get even spicier, as $SOLX could reach a price point of $0.2 for an ROI of 11,381%. If you don’t want to miss this presale, you can secure your $SOLX today , while the presale price is still going. 2. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Free $BTC Airdrops at Key Bitcoin Price Points Bitcoin Bull Token ($BTCBULL) combines meme coin appeal with a unique reward mechanism: free Bitcoin airdrops to holders when BTC reaches $150K and $200K. Positioned as one of the more talked-about presales of 2025, $BTCBULL aims to align itself with Bitcoin’s long-term growth. While it carries the branding and tone of a typical meme project, its direct Bitcoin incentives offer a distinctive angle, drawing increased investor attention. The project rests on the idea that Bitcoin will reach its dream $1M price point and tries to rally the community to make it happen. Despite only having pure meme value, $BTCBULL could gain significant value as Bitcoin rallies and crypto fans begin to take notice. Especially when we consider the airdrop system, which rewards investors with $BTC as the King Coin gains value. If the project wins the community’s support and stays on track, our analysts predict a price point of $0.006467 by the end of 2025 , for an ROI of 154% if you invest at the current price of $0.00254. Long-term, $BTCBULL could jump as high as $0.0497 in 2030, catapulting the ROI to a FOMO-inducing 1,856%. You can secure your $BTCBULL right now as the presale is still going strong, after accumulating over $6.7M so far. 3. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Massive AI Agent-Driven Presale to End in Hours after $12M Run The MIND of Pepe ($MIND) presale is set to end in a little over 24 hours, concluding an impressive $12M run. MIND of Pepe is an evolving and self-governing AI agent whose goal is to create a thriving crypto community and change the way investors interact with the crypto ecosystem. The AI agent is active on X , where it offers valuable insights into the crypto market and evidence-based predictions on trending tokens. As the project witnesses increased community support and investors flock, the developmental process can expand the agent’s capabilities, even allowing it to create presale tokens to which $MIND investors will receive exclusive access. The MIND of Pepe presale is in its final stage, with only hours until the project’s public listing. Technically, the presale ended last Saturday, but you can still purchase $MIND for its presale price until tomorrow, June 3. As to the project’s market potential, the context speaks for itself, as the era of AI agents is already upon us, transforming the way we interact with the internet and, soon, with the crypto market as a whole. The recent case of Donut, the first agentic crypto browser , speaks volumes in this sense, lending credence to MIND of Pepe’s long-term potential. Our analysts predict a price point of $0.065 by the end of 2026 , for an ROI of 73% based on the current price. Naturally, this is a reserved prediction, which could be easily blown out of the water if MIND of Pepe witnesses massive support and public adoption.

2025-06-02T12:30:00,"Wintermute Targets Ethereum Exploits as SharpLink Launches ETH Treasury Plan","Ethereum is the focus of two major developments this week, one on the security front and another in corporate finance. Crypto market maker Wintermute has introduced a novel countermeasure to warn users of malicious Ethereum contracts that exploit EIP-7702, injecting alert messages directly into verified attacker code. Meanwhile, US sports betting firm SharpLink Gaming has filed to raise $1 billion to build a significant Ether treasury, naming Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin as its new board chairman. Ethereum Users Face New Wallet Draining Threat as Wintermute Injects ‘CrimeEnjoyor’ Warnings into Malicious Contracts Ethereum users are being warned of a sophisticated new type of wallet-draining attack, with leading crypto market maker Wintermute stepping in to inject a digital safeguard directly into the threat itself. On May 30, Wintermute revealed its deployment of a novel piece of code, dubbed “CrimeEnjoyor,” which prints prominent warning messages inside malicious Ethereum smart contracts, specifically those abusing a new feature introduced in the Pectra upgrade. This preemptive move comes as Ethereum grapples with the fallout of EIP-7702, a recently launched improvement proposal that gives wallets the ability to temporarily delegate transaction control to smart contracts. While designed to enable powerful new use cases, the feature has quickly become a tool for attackers seeking to automatically siphon ETH from users with compromised private keys. How the Attack Works: Exploiting EIP-7702 EIP-7702 was implemented as part of Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade, which went live on May 7 at epoch 364032. It introduces a new account abstraction mechanism allowing users to hand over transaction authorization to smart contracts on a temporary basis. Although entirely optional and opt-in, the feature has rapidly been adopted by malicious actors due to its ability to automate the sweeping of funds from wallets that have accidentally leaked their private keys. Wintermute’s CrimeEnjoyor contract with a warning statement (Source: Wintermute ) Wintermute’s research uncovered that over 97% of all EIP-7702 delegations thus far have reused the same malicious bytecode—suggesting a copy-paste method among attackers. These so-called “sweeper” contracts are coded to automatically drain any ETH that enters the compromised wallet, giving users no second chance once they deposit funds. “This one copy-pasted bytecode now accounts for the majority of all EIP-7702 delegations,” Wintermute stated in their May 30 announcement. “It’s funny, bleak, and fascinating at the same time.” In response, Wintermute engineers developed and deployed CrimeEnjoyor, which is an intervention that rewrites these malicious contracts to include a human-readable Solidity warning message. To do this, Wintermute reverse-engineered the attacker’s Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode into Solidity, inserted the warning, and publicly verified the contracts so that unsuspecting users might spot the danger before it’s too late. This message is now being surfaced within the most prevalent type of EIP-7702 exploitation contract in an attempt to add a visible red flag to otherwise opaque and technical smart contract interfaces. Wintermute said the purpose is not just to stop this specific campaign, but to spark a broader movement toward transparent tagging of malicious infrastructure. One User Loses $146K in ETH to EIP-7702 Exploit The threat is far from hypothetical. On May 23, blockchain security firm Scam Sniffer reported that one Ethereum user lost approximately $146,550 after interacting with a set of malicious batched transactions exploiting EIP-7702. The user inadvertently signed approval for a sequence of calls that led to an automatic fund sweep from their wallet. According to Dune Analytics data shared by Wintermute, 12,329 transactions leveraging EIP-7702 have occurred since the Pectra upgrade, with many still utilizing malicious code patterns. Wintermute’s injected warning code, while currently found in 94.7% of all EIP-7702 delegate contracts, may gradually diminish in influence as attackers seek new methods. Still, the effort represents a creative countermeasure within an otherwise trustless ecosystem. While EIP-7702 and the broader Pectra upgrade aim to enhance Ethereum's flexibility and scalability, Wintermute warned that a lack of transparency and contract verification tools poses a major security risk, especially for less experienced users. As such, the Ethereum community is being called upon to prioritize UX-friendly security tools that can clearly flag suspicious delegation patterns and transactions. This includes labeling contracts, surfacing unusual gas behaviors, and implementing front-end alerts in common Ethereum wallet interfaces like MetaMask and Rabby. Pectra’s Broader Impact on Ethereum In addition to EIP-7702, Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade also rolled out two other major proposals: EIP-7251: Increased the validator staking limit from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH, making it easier for large entities to manage validator nodes at scale. EIP-7691: Boosted the number of “data blobs” per block—a move aimed at supporting Ethereum layer-2 scalability efforts by enhancing data availability and reducing gas fees for rollups. These technical improvements are part of Ethereum’s long-term roadmap to remain the dominant smart contract platform, though incidents like the EIP-7702 exploit underscore the growing need for accessible, real-time threat visibility within its expanding feature set. SharpLink Gaming Bets Big on Ethereum: Files $1B Stock Offering to Fund Massive ETH Treasury Strategy In related news, US sports betting platform SharpLink Gaming has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer up to $1 billion in shares of common stock, with the vast majority of proceeds earmarked for the purchase of Ether (ETH), the native asset of the Ethereum blockchain. The May 30 SEC filing follows SharpLink’s May 27 announcement of its new Ethereum-based corporate treasury strategy, marking a watershed moment for altcoin adoption among public companies. “We intend to use substantially all of the proceeds from this offering to acquire Ether,” the company wrote, emphasizing a long-term commitment to building a crypto-native balance sheet. The announcement triggered an immediate reaction from the market, with SharpLink Gaming’s stock surging 400% in a single trading day on May 27. The momentum was further fueled by the company’s decision to appoint Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, also CEO of ConsenSys, as chairman of its board of directors, signaling a deep strategic alignment with the Ethereum ecosystem. The parallels to Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin-centric strategy at his firm Strategy were not lost on the crypto community. SharpLink was quickly dubbed “Ethereum’s Michael Saylor” by analysts and educators on social media. “Ethereum finally has its own Saylor,” wrote crypto analyst 0xBoboShanti on X. “You are not bullish enough,” added Ethereum advocate Anthony Sassano, referencing SharpLink’s aggressive treasury move. While SharpLink’s ETH-first vision may appeal to Web3 enthusiasts, the firm was quick to temper expectations with a detailed risk disclosure section in its SEC filing. One concern raised was the potential rise of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). SharpLink acknowledged that a global rollout of CBDCs could “eliminate or reduce the need or demand for private-sector issued cryptocurrencies, or significantly limit their utility,” which could severely impact Ethereum’s value proposition. Another major risk centers on regulatory classification. If Ether is officially labeled as a “security” by the SEC or other regulators, SharpLink could face extensive compliance obligations, including securities registration, reporting requirements, and investor protections under US law. Strategic Timing Amid Ethereum Momentum Institutional interest in Ethereum is gaining traction, following a new filing from REX Shares, which has prompted speculation that Ethereum and Solana staking ETFs could debut in the US within weeks. Analysts say REX’s ETF filing includes unique regulatory “workarounds” that may allow staking, a feature many competing funds have failed to implement due to SEC pushback. This broader backdrop of ecosystem growth, protocol upgrades, and institutional adoption gives SharpLink’s move a certain macro-tactical edge. The company is effectively front-running what could become a multi-billion dollar wave of Ether demand from traditional financial institutions. Historically, public companies that entered crypto did so through Bitcoin, with Michael Saylor’s Strategy acquiring 580,250 BTC (worth over $60 billion) since 2020. Until now, Ethereum had no publicly traded counterpart championing it as a long-term treasury reserve. Strategy Bitcoin holdings (Source: SaylorTracker ) With the appointment of Lubin and a potential billion-dollar ETH buy-in, SharpLink has broken that mold. SharpLink says it will also allocate a portion of the offering proceeds toward working capital, core affiliate marketing operations, general corporate purposes, and operating expenses, but made clear that the bulk of funds would be devoted to Ether purchases. The Bigger Picture: Ethereum as a Corporate Asset SharpLink’s strategy could open the floodgates for a new class of ETH-focused treasuries, expanding the conversation beyond Bitcoin maximalism to embrace Ethereum’s broader smart contract and staking capabilities. It also builds on momentum created by recent Ethereum upgrades, such as EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding) and EIP-7702, which enhance scalability and smart contract delegation, respectively. Ethereum’s fundamental narrative is evolving from “digital oil” to “programmable value infrastructure,” and SharpLink seems to be positioning itself to capitalize on that shift. Whether this strategy pays off will depend on Ethereum’s regulatory clarity, price performance, and network utility growth in the coming years. But for now, it’s clear that SharpLink Gaming is making a high-stakes bet—one that could inspire others to follow suit.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9397/wintermute-targets-ethereum-exploits-as-sharp-link-launches-eth-treasury-plan,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-02T12:28:07,"“Bitcoin is at a Major Turning Point!” Said Experienced Analyst, Shared Two Possible Scenarios He Expects!","Bitcoin (BTC) broke new records in recent weeks, rising above $111. However, there has been a significant decline since then, and Bitcoin's upward momentum is thought to have temporarily weakened. At this point, BTC Markets analyst Rachael Lucas said that the Bitcoin price is at a psychological and technical turning point that could start or end the next bull run. “Indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) are signaling that the current bullish momentum is starting to weaken. However, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin is optimistic, with both analysts and market participants increasingly convinced that we may be entering the early stages of a new supercycle. “At this point, investors are being cautious as they are not sure if this is the beginning of a short-term top or a pause before the next rise.” Bitcoin at Decision Point! While the analyst noted that the long-term outlook is optimistic, he said that Bitcoin is at a critical turning point and there are two possible scenarios for Bitcoin in the coming days. Stating that Bitcoin must remain in the range of $103,000 – $105,000 at this point, the analyst assessed that a possible drop below $103,000 could extend to $93,000. “If Bitcoin can stay in the $103,000-$105,000 range, it could rise again to $115,000. Conversely, if it falls below $103,000, Bitcoin could drop to $93,000.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-02T12:26:26,"Will Bitcoin and altcoins rise in June, or is a new crypto winter coming?","Bitcoin and most altcoins showed mixed performance in the first five months of the year, with Bitcoin reaching a record high twice. Bitcoin ( BTC ) initially jumped to a record high of $109,300 in January and set a new one at $111,900 in May. Other meme coins initially surged in January following the launch of Official Trump ( TRUMP ), but retreated over the first quarter. Most staged a strong recovery in April, with some soaring more than 200% from their lowest levels this year. The question is whether Bitcoin and other altcoins will continue rising in June, or if a new crypto winter is about to start. Historically, June is usually one of the worst months in the crypto market. Most cryptocurrencies drop during the month, while volume typically slips as many investors take a summer holiday break. You might also like: Vitalik Buterin confirms Ethereum’s layer 1 to scale tenfold within 12 Months The average Bitcoin return in June since 2013 is minus 0.34%, while the median is minus 0.23%. This makes it the worst month after September. Also, Bitcoin has posted negative returns in June in most years since 2013. Ethereum’s performance in June is also not encouraging, as it has had a negative return in most years. Its average return since 2016 is minus 6.8%, its worst month of the year. ETH price action by month | Source: CoinGlass Therefore, if history repeats itself, a crypto winter may likely occur in June. This period is characterized by falling or stalling prices and reduced trading activity. It is also marked by a neutral fear and greed index. Bitcoin price action to determine crypto winter BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, will determine whether the crypto winter happens. A strong surge to new record highs may lead to renewed demand for altcoins, including meme coins. The daily chart shows that BTC has pulled back from its all-time high of $111,900 in May to $104,000. This pullback is likely part of the handle formation in a cup-and-handle pattern, a common continuation setup. The cup has a depth of about 32%, suggesting the coin may eventually surge to over $144,600. This target is derived by measuring the same distance from the upper side of the cup. Therefore, Bitcoin may drive a crypto winter as it continues forming the handle section. If this occurs, most altcoins may continue falling in June. Fortunately, due to the cup-and-handle pattern, the crypto winter will likely give way to a crypto spring once Bitcoin rebounds.

2025-06-02T12:20:26,"Stablecoins: US Fed Governor Declares Them a Vital Payment Instrument","BitcoinWorld Stablecoins: US Fed Governor Declares Them a Vital Payment Instrument Are Stablecoins merely a fleeting trend in the volatile world of cryptocurrency, or do they represent something more fundamental to the future of finance? According to a prominent voice from the heart of American monetary policy, it’s the latter. Recent comments from a US Fed Governor suggest that these digital assets, often pegged to stable assets like the US dollar, are viewed primarily through the lens of their utility as a Payment Instrument . This perspective could signal a shift in how regulators approach the burgeoning field of Digital Currency and Crypto Payments . US Fed Governor Waller’s View: Stablecoins as a Payment Instrument The core of the recent discussion comes from U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller. As reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, Governor Waller stated quite plainly that stablecoins are “simply a payment instrument.” This might sound straightforward, but coming from a governor of the Federal Reserve, it carries significant weight. It frames stablecoins not just as speculative investments or complex blockchain technology, but as a practical tool for conducting transactions. Furthermore, Governor Waller highlighted their potential role in fostering competition within the payments sector. The current global payments infrastructure, while functional, often involves intermediaries, fees, and processing times that stablecoins aim to improve upon. By offering a potentially faster, cheaper, and more accessible way to move value, stablecoins could challenge existing payment networks and drive innovation. Why is this perspective from the US Fed important? The Federal Reserve plays a crucial role in overseeing the nation’s payment systems and considering the implications of new financial technologies. Acknowledging stablecoins as legitimate payment instruments, rather than just speculative assets, could pave the way for clearer regulatory frameworks and greater integration into the financial system. Understanding Stablecoins: What Makes Them a Viable Payment Instrument? Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically by being pegged 1:1 with a fiat currency such as the US dollar. This stability is precisely what makes them attractive as a Payment Instrument . When you use a stablecoin to pay for goods or services, or to send money, you want to be confident that its value won’t fluctuate wildly between the time you initiate the transaction and when it’s received. There are different types of stablecoins, primarily categorized by their collateralization method: Fiat-collateralized: Backed by reserves of traditional currency (like USD, EUR) held in banks. Examples include USDT, USDC, BUSD. Crypto-collateralized: Backed by other cryptocurrencies, often over-collateralized to absorb price volatility. Example: DAI. Algorithmic: Do not use direct collateral but rely on algorithms to manage supply and maintain the peg. (Note: This type has faced significant challenges and risks). The most common stablecoins used for Crypto Payments are fiat-collateralized ones, as their direct link to traditional currencies provides a higher degree of predictability needed for everyday transactions. Driving Competition in Payments Through Digital Currency Governor Waller’s emphasis on competition is key. The global payments market is vast and complex, dominated by established players. However, the emergence of Digital Currency , particularly stablecoins, presents an opportunity for disruption. How do stablecoins introduce competition? Lower Transaction Costs: Sending stablecoins can often be cheaper than traditional wire transfers or international remittances, especially for cross-border payments. Faster Settlements: Transactions on blockchain networks can settle in minutes, compared to days for some traditional methods. Increased Accessibility: Stablecoins can potentially be accessed by anyone with an internet connection and a digital wallet, including the unbanked or underbanked populations globally. Programmability: Stablecoins can be integrated into smart contracts, enabling automated payments, escrow services, and complex financial applications not easily done with traditional money. This potential for efficiency and accessibility puts pressure on existing payment providers to innovate and reduce costs, ultimately benefiting consumers and businesses. The US Fed , in its role of maintaining a stable and efficient financial system, recognizes this dynamic. The US Fed’s Broader Perspective on Crypto Payments and Digital Currency Governor Waller’s comments fit into a broader, ongoing conversation within the US Fed and other global central banks about the future of money and payments. While the Fed has been researching a potential U.S. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), often referred to as the “digital dollar,” officials have also acknowledged the role and potential of private sector innovations like stablecoins. Some key considerations for the US Fed regarding stablecoins and Digital Currency include: Financial Stability: Ensuring stablecoins maintain their peg and do not pose risks to the broader financial system if a major issuer were to fail. Consumer Protection: Safeguarding users from fraud, loss of funds, and ensuring transparency from stablecoin issuers. Illicit Finance: Preventing stablecoins from being used for money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illegal activities. Interoperability: How stablecoins might interact with existing payment systems and potentially a future CBDC. Waller’s focus on stablecoins as a Payment Instrument and source of competition suggests that the Fed is not just observing from the sidelines but is actively considering their integration and regulation within the existing financial ecosystem, rather than viewing them solely as external, unregulated entities. Benefits and Challenges: Weighing the Impact of Stablecoins as a Payment Tool While the potential benefits are significant, the path for stablecoins to become widely adopted as a mainstream Payment Instrument is not without hurdles. Potential Benefits: Efficiency: Faster and potentially cheaper transactions, especially cross-border. Accessibility: Broader reach to individuals and businesses outside traditional banking. Innovation: Enables new business models and financial applications (e.g., DeFi, tokenized assets). Transparency: Transactions recorded on a public ledger (depending on the blockchain). Key Challenges: Regulation: Lack of clear, comprehensive regulatory frameworks globally and in the U.S. creates uncertainty. Stability Risks: While designed to be stable, some algorithmic stablecoins have failed, highlighting risks if reserves or mechanisms are insufficient. Adoption: Requires user education, infrastructure development, and merchant acceptance. Interoperability: Different stablecoins on different blockchains need ways to interact seamlessly. Centralization Concerns: Fiat-backed stablecoins often rely on centralized issuers and traditional banks for reserves. Illicit Use: Potential for misuse in illegal activities if not properly regulated and monitored. Addressing these challenges is crucial for stablecoins to fulfill their potential as a widely trusted Payment Instrument and truly contribute to competition in the payments landscape, as highlighted by the US Fed . Actionable Insights: Navigating the Stablecoin Landscape What does Governor Waller’s perspective mean for different stakeholders? For Businesses: Explore accepting Crypto Payments via stablecoins, especially for international transactions. Understand the associated risks and regulatory requirements. Consider how stablecoins could streamline supply chain payments or enable new financial services. For Consumers: Learn about stablecoins as an alternative way to send and receive money. Be aware of the differences between stablecoin types and choose reputable issuers. Understand the security implications of using digital wallets. For Developers and Innovators: Continue building applications that leverage stablecoins for payments, remittances, and financial services. Focus on security, user experience, and compliance with evolving regulations. For Policymakers and Regulators (like the US Fed): Waller’s comments underscore the need for clear and balanced regulation that fosters innovation while mitigating risks. This involves defining stablecoins legally, establishing reserve requirements, and implementing oversight mechanisms. The recognition from a US Fed Governor that stablecoins function as a Payment Instrument is a significant step. It shifts the conversation from whether they are legitimate to how they can be safely and effectively integrated into the financial system to enhance competition and efficiency in Digital Currency payments. Conclusion: Stablecoins Gaining Recognition at the Highest Levels Governor Christopher Waller’s statement that stablecoins are fundamentally a Payment Instrument and a catalyst for competition is a powerful acknowledgment from within the US Fed . It signals that policymakers are increasingly viewing these digital assets not just as fringe crypto phenomena but as potentially vital components of the future payments landscape. While significant regulatory and technical challenges remain, this perspective from a key figure like Waller lends credibility to the utility of stablecoins for Crypto Payments and highlights their potential to drive innovation in the realm of Digital Currency . The focus is clearly shifting towards understanding how best to harness the benefits of stablecoins while ensuring financial stability and consumer protection.

According to a June 2 announcement, the Japanese investment firm said it acquired the Bitcoin at an average price of $108,400 per coin for a total of $117.5 million. Massive corporate purchases at prices above the $100,000 mark indicate increasing institutional confidence in the current Bitcoin bull cycle. Bitcoin soared to an all-time high of nearly $112,000 on May 22 before retreating to $104,342 at press time, as per data from CoinGecko. With the latest buy, Metaplanet now holds 8,888 Bitcoin, worth roughly $930 million at current prices. The company is now a step closer to its year-end target of 10,000 BTC . Metaplanet’s ambitious Bitcoin accumulation strategy, which began with its official adoption of a Bitcoin treasury policy in April 2024, has pushed the firm to the top spot among corporate BTC holders in Asia and the top ten worldwide. Strategy remains the top Bitcoin holder in the world, with more than 580,250 BTC under its belt.

As the multi-coin rally picks up pace, it is standing out as the clear favorite among low-cap opportunities. Bitcoin Price Spike Targets $130,000 As Multi-Coin Rally Gains Momentum Trending crypto news this week highlights the Bitcoin price weekly chart breakout, setting the stage for a $130,000 target. The Bitcoin price surge is also fueling momentum for a broader multi-coin rally, with top altcoins gaining traction. According to technical analyst Titan of Crypto on X (formerly Twitter), the Bitcoin price is eyeing the blue line of the Golden Ratio Multiplier, with the next stop at $130,000. At press time, the Bitcoin price sits at $105,797 after briefly spiking over 10% to hit $112,000 on the weekly chart. This strong movement reinforces confidence in both Bitcoin price strength and the potential scale of the ongoing multi-coin rally. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Tracks New Gains In The Wake Of Multi-Coin Rally The recent Bitcoin price surge is setting up the market for a multi-coin rally, with Shiba Inu (SHIB) and FloppyPepe (FPPE) emerging as key altcoins expected to lead the charge. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is currently trading at $0.00001338, reflecting a 50% drop over the past year and a 15% decline in the last week, per CoinGecko. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted on X that Shiba Inu (SHIB) is consolidating within a triangle pattern, signaling a possible 17% breakout move. As part of the broader multi-coin rally, investors are watching closely to see if Shiba Inu (SHIB) will break upward or continue trending lower. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Leads Multi-Coin Rally With 80% Bonus And Strong Presale Momentum The multi-coin rally is gaining unstoppable momentum, with FloppyPepe (FPPE) positioned to lead alongside Shiba Inu (SHIB) as prices soar. This surge reflects the strength behind the Bitcoin price breakout, which set the stage for a $130,000 target, fueling excitement across the market. With a limited-time 80% bonus using the code “ FLOPPY80 ,” SolidProof audited staking options for passive income generation are still available. FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) second-stage presale $0.00000035 price is a rare window into a fast-moving bull wave, and once the meme coin hits major exchanges, this low-cap gem might never be this cheap again.
