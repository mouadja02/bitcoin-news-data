2025-06-02T14:54:42,"Today, 13 Years Ago, Arthur Britto Committed This Code that Created the 100 Billion XRP","On this day, thirteen years ago, a pivotal moment in the history of cryptocurrency unfolded, one that would set the stage for what is now one of the most prominent digital assets in the world. As highlighted by respected XRP Ledger validator, Vet, in a recent post on X, June 2 marks the anniversary of when Arthur Britto, one of the key architects behind the Ripple project, committed the code that officially created the supply of 100 billion XRP. This was not just a technical milestone; it was the foundational moment that birthed an entire ecosystem aimed at revolutionizing global payments. Happy Birthday XRP! Today, 13 years ago, Arthur Britto committed this code that created the 100b XRP. https://t.co/Ku748uUAhE — Vet (@Vet_X0) June 2, 2025 The Birth of XRP and Ripple’s Vision Arthur Britto, alongside David Schwartz and Jed McCaleb, envisioned a blockchain-based digital asset that could address the inefficiencies plaguing traditional financial systems. While Bitcoin had emerged a few years earlier as a decentralized peer-to-peer electronic cash system, the Ripple founders saw an opportunity to tackle a different problem: cross-border payments. Existing systems like SWIFT were slow, expensive, and fragmented. The idea behind XRP was to create a digital asset that could act as a universal bridge currency, enabling instant, low-cost transfers across currencies, banks, and borders. The creation of the 100 billion XRP supply, fixed, finite, and pre-mined, was a deliberate design choice. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, where new coins are introduced through mining or staking, all XRP came into existence at once. This approach was intended to ensure predictability, efficiency, and scalability, allowing Ripple to distribute XRP strategically to support network growth and adoption. While this pre-mining model has drawn criticism over the years, particularly from those who advocate for proof-of-work systems, it has also enabled Ripple to forge partnerships with major financial institutions and central banks. Arthur Britto: The Quiet Architect Although much of the public attention has centered on Ripple’s executive chairman, Chris Larsen, and CTO David Schwartz , Arthur Britto’s role has been equally foundational. Britto, known for his intensely private nature, was instrumental in the early protocol design and in envisioning XRP’s scalability for global use. His early contributions, including the fateful code commit 13 years ago, laid the groundwork for Ripple’s goal of building an “Internet of Value”, a world where money moves as seamlessly as information does today. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Britto’s influence extends beyond the original codebase. He remains a key figure behind the scenes, particularly through his work at PolySign, a company focused on institutional-grade digital asset custody. His technical foresight continues to shape the evolution of digital finance, even if he chooses to stay largely out of the limelight. XRP’s Journey: Triumphs, Challenges, and Resilience Since its creation, XRP has weathered dramatic highs and lows. It became one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, achieving major exchange listings and becoming a pillar of RippleNet, Ripple’s enterprise blockchain payment platform. At its peak, XRP’s price soared to over $3 in early 2018, making early adopters and supporters hopeful of an even greater breakthrough. Yet the journey has not been without challenges. Regulatory scrutiny, particularly from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has cast a long shadow over Ripple and XRP . Despite these legal hurdles, XRP has maintained a loyal global community and continues to see active development, with Ripple expanding its services, including in central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiatives, cross-border remittances, and tokenization projects. The Legacy of a Code Commit What makes Vet’s reminder so powerful is not just the nostalgia of looking back but the realization of how one code commit can shape an entire technological and financial movement. On June 2, 2012, when Arthur Britto formalized the creation of the XRP supply, he wasn’t just writing code; he was setting in motion a vision of financial interoperability that still inspires innovation today. As Ripple continues to push forward, whether through legal victories, technological advancements, or new partnerships, the foundational act that took place thirteen years ago remains central. It is a testament to the power of vision, code, and collaboration, and to the enduring ambition of building a financial system fit for the digital age. Happy Birthday, XRP.

2025-06-02T14:50:05,"Bitcoin Price Stalls: Why Strategic Positioning is Crucial Now","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Stalls: Why Strategic Positioning is Crucial Now If you’ve been watching the charts, you’ve probably noticed something about the Bitcoin price lately – it feels a bit stuck. After a period of excitement, the momentum seems to have stalled, leaving many wondering what’s next. This is a key moment where understanding the market structure becomes vital for crypto investors looking to navigate these choppy waters effectively. What Does a Stalled Bitcoin Price Mean? Recent observations from crypto data analytics firm Swissblock, shared on social media, highlight this exact scenario. They pointed out that Bitcoin’s structure has shifted. This change occurred after what they described as a failed breakout attempt towards the significant $110,000–$111,000 level. While this level might seem far off from current prices, the inability of the market to sustain momentum even *towards* such ambitious targets signals a lack of immediate bullish conviction. Instead of pushing higher, BTC has retreated and is now consolidating within a lower price range. This range-bound action is characterized by: Defined Boundaries: Price tends to bounce between clear support and resistance levels. Reduced Volatility (Often): Compared to trending markets, price swings within the range can be less dramatic, though sudden spikes or drops are always possible. Trader Frustration: Failed breakouts in either direction can trap traders and lead to sideways chop. This period contrasts sharply with the impulsive moves seen during strong uptrends or downtrends. It suggests a phase of indecision or accumulation/distribution among market participants. Why is Market Positioning More Important Than Chasing Now? Swissblock’s analysis emphasizes that the current environment is less about ‘chasing’ pumps or dumps and more about ‘positioning’. What exactly does this mean for your BTC trading strategy ? Think of it like this: Chasing Positioning Buying aggressively as price rises, fearing missing out (FOMO). Strategically buying or selling at key support/resistance levels within the range. Selling in panic as price drops sharply. Setting limit orders at desired entry/exit points. Reacting emotionally to short-term price swings. Planning trades based on technical analysis and market structure. Higher risk of buying the top or selling the bottom of a short-term move. Focusing on accumulating or distributing positions patiently. In a range-bound market, chasing breakouts often leads to getting trapped in false moves. The smart money isn’t blindly buying every small uptick; they are likely building positions at favorable prices within the established range, anticipating the eventual larger move. What Does a Market Cleanout Involve and Why Might it Be Necessary? Swissblock expects the next major move to come only after a ‘market cleanout’. This term might sound dramatic, but it’s a common concept in volatile markets like crypto. A market cleanout typically involves: Increased Volatility: A sharp, often sudden price swing (up or down) that breaks the current pattern. Liquidation Cascades: Leveraged positions that are stopped out, forcing more buying or selling and accelerating the price move. Shaking Out Weak Hands: Inexperienced or overly leveraged traders are forced out of their positions due to margin calls or stop losses being hit. Testing Key Levels: Price often aggressively tests significant support or resistance levels, sometimes even temporarily breaking them before reversing. Why is this ‘cleanout’ necessary before a major move? Consolidation periods allow leverage to build up in the system. A sharp move is needed to ‘reset’ this leverage by liquidating positions on one side of the market. This creates the necessary fuel (orders) for the price to then move more freely and decisively in the opposite direction, initiating the next trend phase. How Can Crypto Investors Strategically Position Themselves Now? Given this analysis, patience and strategic thinking are paramount for crypto investors . Here are some actionable insights: Identify the Range: Clearly define the current support and resistance levels where Bitcoin is trading. These become your potential entry and exit points. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the exact bottom of the range, systematically invest a fixed amount at regular intervals. This averages out your purchase price. Set Limit Orders: Place buy orders at or near the identified support level and sell orders at or near the resistance level. This automates your positioning and removes emotion. Manage Risk: Use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses if the price breaks decisively out of the range against your position. Don’t over-leverage. Focus on the Long Term: If you’re a long-term holder, short-term range-bound action can be seen as an opportunity to accumulate at potentially favorable prices. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on broader crypto market analysis and macroeconomic factors that could trigger the next major move or cleanout. This isn’t a time for impulsive decisions. It’s a time for calculated moves, much like a chess player positioning their pieces before a major attack. What Does Broader Crypto Market Analysis Suggest? While Bitcoin often leads the way, its current state influences the entire market. Altcoins may also consolidate or show muted performance while BTC is range-bound. A cleanout in Bitcoin could lead to significant volatility across the board. Understanding the macro landscape is also crucial: Economic Indicators: Inflation data, interest rate decisions, and recession fears can all impact investor sentiment and capital flows into risk assets like crypto. Regulatory News: Developments regarding crypto regulation in major economies can create uncertainty or provide clarity. Network Fundamentals: On-chain data, mining difficulty, and development updates provide insights into the health and growth of the Bitcoin network itself. Integrating these factors into your crypto market analysis provides a more complete picture beyond just the price chart. Conclusion: Patience is Your Greatest Asset The message from analysts like Swissblock is clear: Bitcoin is in a consolidation phase, and the path forward likely involves a volatility-inducing ‘cleanout’ before a new trend emerges. For crypto investors , this isn’t a time for impatient chasing but for disciplined market positioning . By identifying the range, managing risk, and employing a thoughtful BTC trading strategy , you can prepare for the next significant move rather than being caught off guard by it. Patience, combined with strategic planning, remains one of the most valuable assets in the unpredictable world of cryptocurrency.

Here’s What David Sacks Revealed appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News On May 27, 2025, US President’s crypto czar, David Sacks, says there is a pathway to acquire more bitcoin for the U.S. strategic reserve . This move follows Donald Trump’s executive order signed in March 2025, establishing the reserve as a new pillar for US digital asset policy. US Crypto-Focused Executive Action During a fireside chat with Gemini co-founders, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Sacks stated that federal purchase of bitcoin is not guaranteed. “ I can’t promise anything ,” Sacks said, “ but there is a pathway to doing that… if they can figure out how to fund it, they actually do have presidential authorization ready.” However, it might make some progress if done in the best manner. The executive order drawn in March was created with 200,000 Bitcoin ($22 million), which the government forfeited from civil and criminal assets. Sacks referenced using surplus money from other government programs to fund such acquisitions. In addition, he said, if the US can convince Howard Lutnik and Scott Bressent to buy some, then there will be no additional taxes on cryptocurrency. Crypto Agenda – With this plan, President Trump believes that the US could acquire its crypto agenda by August. Besides the Strategic plan for Bitcoin, David Sacks outlines other policies for crypto in the US. Sacks also expects the Genius Act Stablecoins bill to pass, and the market structure bill is likely before August. These policies aim to reform the crypto space in the US and prevent future regulatory backsliding. The Budget-Neutral Plan Sacks explained that the federal government is allowed to acquire bitcoin but only in budget budget-neutral way. If it can be done in a budget-neutral way, specifically, if either the Commerce Department or the Treasury Department can figure out how to fund it without adding to the debt, then they are allowed to create those programs,” Sacks stated. It states that the government can only acquire more bitcoin if it increases the national debt or requires new taxes. The cabinet officials are tasked with developing strategies to fund such acquisitions. This includes reallocating unused funds from the existing federal government.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/can-u-s-buy-more-bitcoin-heres-what-david-sacks-revealed/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-06-02T14:42:11,"Ripple Price at Pivotal Juncture: Dump Below $2 or Surge to $4.5 Next for XRP?","TL;DR Ripple’s cross-border token has struggled in the past week, alongside most of the market, and has dropped below a crucial support line, which has now turned into resistance. Analysts outlined a couple of different scenarios for the asset, which envision a price drop below $2 or a surge to $4.5. Is XRP Actually Heading for New ATH? The fourth-largest cryptocurrency surged in mid-May as the rest of the market recovered from the Trump-induced crash in early April. However, it couldn’t rise any higher than $2.6, where it was halted on a couple of occasions, while BTC managed to break through and chart a new all-time high of almost $112,000. Ethereum also outperformed XRP on a monthly scale, as the latter’s price seems stuck . Moreover, the asset fell below $2.3 in the past few days, a level that many analysts highlighted as a crucial support, now turned into a key resistance. Cryptowzrd noted that XRP closed indecisively the week, but pointed out the $2.21 resistance as the first obstacle in the asset’s long road to recovery. However, if it manages to reclaim it, this could form an inverse head-and-shoulders, which could result in offering a “long opportunity.” CW believes XRP’s turn “has come,” and suggested that the asset is expected to break through the current small convergence. If this pattern plays out, XRP’s next price target can be $4.5, which would mean a massive surge past the January 2018 all-time high of around $3.4. $XRP ‘s turn has come. It briefly broken the upper line of the convergence in the short-term correction, but the price recovered rapidly. And the uptrend that signals the end of the retest is imminent. This time, it is expected to break through that small convergence.

The analyst told their over 90,000 followers on X that Ripple’s token is currently at a “critical breakdown point.” It has dropped below key EMAs and is currently testing the 200 EMA. If it fails to remain above it, XRP could be on its way to the $2 support or even lower. They urged the bulls to “step in now,” or there will be more pain ahead for XRP. $XRP is at a critical breakdown point! Price has slipped below key EMAs and is now testing the 200 EMA.

On May 25, 2025, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb announced the bold strategy, stating, “This strategic allocation marks a pivotal moment in Pakistan’s digital transformation journey, unlocking economic potential by turning excess energy into innovation, investment, and international revenue.” Here’s why Pakistan is taking this high-voltage leap into the digital future: Driving Digital Growth Through Surplus Power Pakistan has experienced an electricity surplus due to heavy investment in power infrastructure and reduced industrial activity. Instead of wasting this power, the government plans to repurpose it for Bitcoin mining operations and AI data centers, enabling economic returns from otherwise idle resources. Attracting Investment and Revenue By legalizing and promoting Bitcoin mining, Pakistan aims to: Attract foreign and local investors Generate new streams of tax revenue Earn foreign exchange reserves Position itself as a sovereign digital economy in the global crypto space With crypto assets and AI technologies booming worldwide, this move could help Pakistan ride the next big digital wave. Building Tech Infrastructure and Jobs This initiative is not just about mining Bitcoin—it’s about building a digital ecosystem. By powering AI infrastructure: Pakistan boosts its domestic AI capabilities Creates high-skilled job opportunities for youth Encourages growth in fields like blockchain, data science, and cloud computing It’s a strategic approach to tackle unemployment and prepare the workforce for the future of tech. Clear Regulations, Real Impact Bilal Bin Saqib, Head of Crypto Council, called the move a “turning point” for Pakistan’s economy. He emphasized the need for transparent regulations and proper systems to fully unlock the potential of this transition. “With clear guidelines and secure systems, Pakistan can be a major player in the global crypto economy.” Joining Asia’s Crypto-Forward League Pakistan is now following in the footsteps of Kazakhstan, Japan, Malaysia, and Bhutan, all of which have embraced legal Bitcoin mining to fuel their economies. These countries have already cracked down on illicit mining and established regulated environments for digital growth.

2025-06-02T14:38:30,"Russian brokers and banks line up to launch crypto derivatives","Financial institutions in Russia, from brokers and banks to stock exchanges, are announcing a number of offerings of crypto derivatives following the central bank’s decision to legalize the latter. Some of the most prominent players in the country’s finance industry are entering the race to provide investors with a choice of options to put money into instruments, the yields of which are tied to the prices of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Finam offers crypto derivatives to Russian investors One by one, financial firms in Russia are lining up to tap into a promising market set to emerge after the country’s monetary authority permitted the offering of a new class of products – derivatives linked to decentralized digital assets. Finam, a well-established Russian broker since the early ‘90s, has joined the race. The company said it’s going to put out derivatives on leading cryptocurrencies, portfolios of several currencies, and products providing exposure to active algorithmic strategies. The most popular cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), and others, will serve as base assets of Finam’s derivatives, the business daily Vedomosti reported on Sunday, quoting a representative of the investment firm. The products will be offered only to “ highly qualified investors ,” as per the Bank of Russia’s circular from May 28. To be accepted as such, private individuals would have to prove investments in securities or deposits exceeding 100 million rubles ($1.25 million) and 50 million rubles in annual income, the regulator suggested earlier this year. The instruments will help investors profit from both growing and declining crypto prices. Finam will develop tools allowing to obtain inverse profitability, an analogue of “shorts,” a representative of the brokerage explained. It plans to launch four different crypto products, the business news portal RBC reported. Sberbank issues structured bonds on Bitcoin Russia’s banking and financial giant Sberbank (Sber) has already issued structured bonds, the yield of which is tied to the value of Bitcoin, Vedomosti noted in another article. Holders will be able to benefit from both the changing prices of the leading cryptocurrency in U.S. dollars and the potential strengthening of the American fiat against the Russian ruble. Transactions with the bonds are carried out in local currency, under Russian law and using domestic infrastructure, a spokesperson told the newspaper. The securities will be listed on the Moscow Exchange, the largest stock exchange in the Russian Federation. Sber, which is the largest Russian bank in terms of assets, also prepares to give clients access to other exchange-traded instruments providing exposure to cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin futures. These will be available through its Sberinvestments mobile app, the bank official unveiled. Another majority state-owned bank, VTB, announced it’s going to offer qualified investors access to the new crypto-linked structured bonds, too. Two Russian commercial banks, T-Bank and Alfa-Bank, said they have developed Bitcoin-based digital financial assets ( DFAs ). Alexey Ilyasov, chief executive of Russian asset tokenization platform Atomize, and T-Bank’s partner in the DFA project, was quoted by Kommersant as stating: “More and more investors, from active traders and private banking clients to legal entities, are considering adding a reasonable amount of cryptocurrencies to their portfolio, including for the purposes of diversification and risk hedging.” Russian exchanges to begin trading Bitcoin futures Shortly after the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) announced it was legalizing crypto derivatives on Wednesday, the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) pulled the curtain on its plan to start the trading of a Bitcoin futures contract on a fund tracking the price of Bitcoin, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). The digital currency quote will be expressed in U.S. dollars per lot and settlements will be made in Russian rubles, Kommersant and RBC detailed in separate reports. Trading will open on June 4 and the futures will expire in September. Meanwhile, the St. Petersburg Exchange (SPB) also revealed it intends to commence trading of futures tied to the value of cryptocurrencies. It told the Tass news agency that professional participants in the market have been already granted access to the contract, and they are currently testing it.

2025-06-02T14:37:57,"Analyst Spots Huge Liquidity Pool to Support XRP If it Falls to This Level","Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk), a prominent crypto analyst, has drawn attention to XRP’s current price action by highlighting a substantial liquidity pool around $2. In a recent post on X, he described it as the largest liquidity pool he has seen in a long time. This view is underpinned by a detailed liquidity chart, which confirms the dense concentration of buy and sell orders around this level. Liquidity Concentration and Technical Implications The attached liquidation heat map highlights a significant band of liquidity just above and below the $2 level. The analyst reveals that the $2 price zone is the most concentrated area of liquidity on the short-term chart and explains that while the asset’s price does not have to reach this level, the presence of such deep liquidity makes it a critical area to watch . He notes that if XRP does not revisit this zone, it would warrant caution for traders considering upside positions. However, recent analysis suggests that failure to hold certain crucial levels could send the digital asset back to $2. I don't trust a bounce here for $XRP . This is the largest liquidity pool I've seen in a long time tbh. I'd be suprised if we don't touch this area; https://t.co/EtfakyW8f7 pic.twitter.com/g8423sN4nI — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) June 1, 2025 We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The analyst also references the recent formation of an inverse head and shoulders pattern , which, if completed, would align with a move down to $2 before any significant upward reversal. Historical Context and Market Behavior Historically, the $2 level has acted as a resilient support for XRP. Each time the price has approached this mark, it has triggered substantial buy interest and subsequent rebounds. Cryptoinsightuk has previously drawn attention to the support at the $2 level, stating that he was ready to go all in on XRP if it hit that level, showing his conviction in the strength of this support. The resilience of the $2 support has led some prominent figures in the XRP community to liken it to the $0.5 level that held up the asset for years, suggesting that $2 could now serve as a long-term floor for the asset. What to Expect from XRP The analyst’s outlook is also influenced by broader market conditions. Should Bitcoin experience a pullback to the $100,000 level, it would be reasonable to expect XRP to follow suit and test the $2 liquidity pool. Cryptoinsightuk emphasizes that while a move to $2 is not guaranteed, the high concentration of open interest at this price makes it a likely target for any significant downward move. He cautions that this area is susceptible to price manipulation due to the volume of orders resting there, which could lead to a swift sweep of local lows before any potential upside.

2025-06-02T14:30:53,"Bitcoin Rise To $111,000 ATH Doesn’t Mean The Market Is Bullish, Certified Expert Says","Bitcoin’s bullish momentum has somewhat faded after reaching an all-time high of $111,000 on May 22, casting doubt on the sustainability of the rally. Bitcoin has pulled back slightly after its record-setting push, and analysts are split on what this means for its price action going forward. Interestingly, not everyone is convinced the recent all-time high reflects genuine strength. One of the most notable voices challenging this is certified crypto expert Tony “The Bull” Severino, who warned that Bitcoin’s move may not be as solid as it looks on the surface. In his assessment, Tony Severino argues that the breakout to $111,814 lacks the technical confirmation usually associated with a true bullish breakout. He noted that while BTCUSD did print a new high, other major trading pairs did not follow suit. Failed Breakout Indicates Weakness Rather Than Strength Particularly, Bitcoin failed to reach a new all-time high against currencies such as the Euro, British Pound, Japanese Yen, and the Swiss Franc. The same applies to BTC/XAU, Bitcoin’s price measured against gold, which currently lags far behind its former peak of 41 ounces per Bitcoin. At the time of writing, that pair is still hovering at 32 ounces, a significant difference that suggests the upward momentum is isolated to the US Dollar. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Trend Above $100,000: The Good News And The Bad News This divergence leads Severino to argue that the move could be a byproduct of the USD’s weakness rather than Bitcoin’s strength. A true bullish breakout, he says, would have been evident across multiple currency pairs and asset benchmarks. His skepticism is further reinforced by the structure of the charts, as seen in the six comparative panels he shared on the social media platform X. Most of them show Bitcoin forming lower highs or simply failing to match the previous all-time level. For instance, Bitcoin priced in euros is still well below its peak of €105,890, currently trading around €93,229. Similarly, Bitcoin has failed to breach the 17 million mark against the Japanese Yen and now sits at ¥15.28 million. The same trend is repeated in the Swiss Franc and British Pound pairings, with BTC / Swiss Franc failing to cross 99,254 and BTCGBP forming a lower high at $78,228. These price actions make it difficult to argue that Bitcoin is in a universally strong position, particularly when measured in anything other than USD. Caution With Next Monthly Candle Open In conclusion, Tony Severino warns traders and investors not to be misled by the surface-level optimism that comes with a new all-time high in BTCUSD. A single breakout, especially one lacking confirmation from cross-pair strength and fundamental indicators, does not necessarily signal the start of a new wave five or a sustained bullish trend for the Bitcoin price. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Big Drop For Bitcoin Price As Bearish Pressures Mount After $111,000 ATH According to him, the May monthly candle close and the June monthly candle open will be important in determining the next direction. If the current indecision tilts bearish, technicals could teeter back bearish towards a larger correction. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,850 after reaching a 24-hour low of $103,832. This is a brief recovery from its June open of $104,646.

2025-06-02T14:30:50,"Analyst Unveils ‘Most Bullish Scenario’ for Bitcoin, Predicts Shallow BTC Pullback Before Leg up to Fresh Record Highs","An analyst known for making timely Bitcoin calls is outlining what he believes is the most bullish scenario for BTC as the crypto king struggles to sustain a rally above $110,000. In a new strategy session, pseudonymous analyst Credible tells his 70,100 YouTube subscribers that he thinks Bitcoin will not retest a key psychological level as support if BTC is in the midst of an aggressive uptrend. “If we are in the most bullish scenario, then we will not take these lows [at $100,000]. We’ll simply find buyers above these lows, will front run them and we’ll continue higher.” But the trader notes that even in the most bullish case, he expects BTC to witness a different kind of correction, one defined by time rather than price. “These corrective structures can drag out as we well know by now, and they take a lot of different shapes and forms, but at the end of the day what we have here is some combination of corrective, choppy price action before the next impulse starts. And so even if we make marginal higher highs, but if we’re not moving up with momentum, then we can pull back down and just chop around for a bit longer. I’d like the green zone to be tapped ideally. And in the most bullish case, that’s as low as we go. Whether we take the highs or not, it doesn’t matter. And then we just get more chop and then we erupt again impulsively.” Source: Credible/YouTube Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that BTC will surge to $140,000 in his most bullish scenario.

2025-06-02T14:30:08,"Bitcoin (BTC) and Altcoins Today's Focus is on FED Chairman Jerome Powell! What Time Will He Speak? Here's All You Need to Know!","Bitcoin (BTC) and the cryptocurrency market have experienced a decline in recent days as US customs duties, which were suspended by US President Donald Trump, have become a current issue again. Having fallen by 5.2% in the last week, BTC saw below $104,000, but with a slight recovery, it rose just above $104,000 again. Despite this decline, the expectation of an increase in Bitcoin and altcoins continues, and the agenda of the cryptocurrency sector today includes the speech to be made by US Federal Reserve (FED) Chairman Jerome Powell. Jerome Powell, who will speak at the 75th Anniversary Conference of the FED's International Finance Division at 20:00 Turkish time, will seek signals regarding the ongoing uncertainties in the global economy and the effects of tariffs on the United States. Global markets started the new week on a negative note, amid the uncertainty created by US President Donald Trump's decision to increase steel tariffs and his accusations against China that it violated the agreement. In addition, Powell's potential comments on developments regarding tariffs and the US administration's policies will also be closely monitored during the speech. Powell is expected to touch on many issues, including monetary policy, and is also expected to address the resignation claims. However, for now, Powell's resignation announcement remains a low possibility. As is known, Donald Trump does not want FED Chairman Powell for a long time and expects him to resign. Because the FED's failure to cut interest rates under Powell's chairmanship causes Trump to demand Powell's resignation. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-02T14:25:17,"Analyst Says Bitcoin Daily Close Above $104,674 Is Bullish. Here’s Why","Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, continues to capture the attention of analysts, traders, and investors as it dances around historic price levels. According to a recent analysis shared by popular crypto analyst Egrag Crypto on X, Bitcoin’s near-term bullish outlook hinges on a key price milestone: a daily close above $104,674. This level, Egrag explains, is not just a psychological barrier but a critical technical juncture. It aligns with the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the Fibonacci 0.888 retracement level, both known indicators of market strength and momentum. A daily close above this threshold would signal strong bullish sentiment, suggesting that buyers are in control and that Bitcoin could soon chart a path toward new all-time highs (ATH). #BTC – Daily Close Above $104,674 Is Bullish! For #BTC to remain bullish, it must close above $104,674 on the daily chart. This level aligns with the 21 EMA and the Fib 0.888 – signaling strong bullish momentum. However, a different scenario could play out: A #Bearish … pic.twitter.com/h0Q6wmMkC9 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) June 2, 2025 Why $104,674 Matters To understand the significance of the $104,674 mark, one must consider how technical analysis plays a role in crypto markets. The 21 EMA is often viewed as a dynamic support or resistance level. When the price trades above this average, it generally signals that the prevailing trend is bullish. In combination, the Fibonacci 0.888 retracement level is regarded by many traders as a “last line” of retracement before a continuation of the larger trend, in this case, upward. Egrag Crypto’s post highlights that a daily close above this level will cement bullish momentum, increasing the probability that Bitcoin will push past resistance levels and aim for new price discoveries beyond its previous highs. The Bearish Alternative: Watching Key Support Levels While the bullish scenario is compelling, Egrag Crypto prudently outlines an alternative, more cautious possibility: a bearish retest. Should Bitcoin fail to maintain a daily close above $104,674, the analyst points to the Fibonacci 0.618 level as the next critical support zone. This level has historically acted as a sturdy floor during pullbacks, providing the foundation for recovery and fresh rallies. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, if this support fails to hold, Egrag warns that the market could experience a deeper correction, potentially driving Bitcoin’s price down to the Fibonacci 0.5 zone. Such a move would likely trigger a wick, a temporary sharp price dip, that could flush out leveraged positions and shake weaker hands before any subsequent recovery. For traders, this scenario underscores the importance of risk management and close monitoring of market reactions at key support levels. Volume as the Confirmation Signal Beyond price action and chart patterns, volume remains the ultimate confirmation signal. Egrag emphasizes that traders must observe whether daily volume aligns with price movements to determine the strength of the breakout or retracement. A breakout to new ATHs without corresponding volume could indicate a lack of conviction among market participants, raising the risk of a swift reversal. Conversely, a breakout supported by surging volume would provide stronger confirmation that the bullish trend is intact and sustainable. For now, the crypto community waits with bated breath. Bitcoin’s position near critical technical levels makes it a magnet for both bullish and bearish speculation. Whether the market leans toward new highs or a retracement first, one thing is clear: as long as Bitcoin hovers near these pivotal zones, the next few daily closes will be crucial in shaping its medium-term trajectory.

2025-06-02T14:24:48,"Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq slip as U.S.-China trade tensions linger","Stocks opened lower on Monday, June 2 as investors began the new month on fresh jitters amid the ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China. Global stocks saw some downside action as Asian and European markets closed lower and U.S. stocks slipped. For the major U.S. indices, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 160 points. Investor jitters also saw the S&P 500 pull back 0.4% and Nasdaq Composite open 0.5% down. A resilient stock market ended May in bullish territory despite the notable tariff -driven downswings that punctuated sentiment throughout the month. Dow edged 4% higher in May, while Nasdaq led the gains with 9% over the month amid some huge earnings-driven performances. Perhaps more notably was the S&P 500 marching to its best May performance since 1990, and the best overall month since November 2023. Tailwinds that pushed stocks higher also catalyzed gains for cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) storming to its all-time high above $111k. However, like the broader risk assets market, Bitcoin price is down and near $104k. Across the market, the U.S. dollar fell slightly and gold rose as flight to safe haven assets reemerged. Meanwhile, oil prices jumped following news that OPEC+ plans a much smaller hike in output than the market anticipated. On Saturday, OPEC+, encompassing a group of global oil producers, announced an increase of 411,000 barrels of oil a day. You might also like: Dow inches higher, S&P 500 caps best May since 1990 The latest pullback for stocks comes as investors weigh ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions. Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump spooked investors when he threatened to increase tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%. It followed Trump’s claim that China had “violated” the trade agreement recently agreed in Geneva, Switzerland. But China has hit back, noting the U.S. has failed to honor its part of the deal. This fresh escalation threatens to inject negative sentiment in the market. While Trump’s tax bill is in focus this week amid a series of data releases, tariffs will likely be among top factors to watch. Eyes will also be on the geopolitical front after Ukraine’s drone strikes against Russia. Despite these factors, Tom Lee, co-founder and managing partner of Fundstrat, is bullish on the S&P 500. Lee shared his outlook with CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’, noting that the index has a higher chance of hitting 6,600 going forward than it was in February. The S&P 500 hovers around 5,911, up from 4,982 in early April. It topped around 6,144 in February 2025.

2025-06-02T14:24:31,"Best Crypto to Buy Now As Ethereum ETPs Record Massive Surge","Bitcoin’s recent decline to the $103,000 range may have rattled overly-leveraged traders like James Wynn, but altcoins—especially Ether—are showing a much firmer stance than expected. While Bitcoin ETPs are seeing minor outflows, Ether investment products have taken a sharply different trajectory. Instead of buckling under market pressure, Ether-based ETPs have drawn significant investor interest. The largest altcoin by market cap appears to be experiencing a quiet momentum shift, with capital flowing in at levels not seen since the last bullish stretch of 2024. That suggests something deeper at play than simple price action. Ether ETPs Are Soaking Up Liquidity as Bitcoin ETFs Face Profit-Taking Last week’s crypto ETP flows tell a tale of two trends—Bitcoin, the market giant, saw outflows, while Ether surged ahead with the strongest inflows seen since December 2024. According to data released by CoinShares, Ether ETPs brought in a remarkable $321 million in a single week. In contrast, Bitcoin investment products slipped by $8 million, signaling the end of a six-week inflow streak. This reversal comes at a time when Bitcoin’s price dipped nearly 6% within a week, sparking selling activity and apparent seasonal caution. The surge in Ether inflows has been attributed to improving fundamentals within its ecosystem, from stronger futures activity to signs of technical resilience. After being written off by some firms earlier in May as a “meme-like” asset, ETH seems to be regaining serious investor confidence. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's drop—triggered partly by broader macro factors like tariff uncertainty and profit-taking—highlighted its vulnerability to short-term swings, especially after its rally to $110,000. JUST IN: ETH sees $321 million in net inflows last week, highest since December 2024 - CoinShares. pic.twitter.com/ptDSzSJXFF — Whale Insider (@WhaleInsider) June 2, 2025 Despite Ether’s sharp pullback from $2,771 to around $2,400, investors appear to be treating the dip as an accumulation zone rather than a red flag. Over the past 30 days, ETH has still added 36% to its value—enough to reignite interest that had been fading just weeks ago. The renewed appetite for Ether ETPs isn't just about a single asset finding its footing again. It may signal a major change in sentiment, where investors are beginning to look beyond Bitcoin for value. If capital continues flowing into Ether while BTC stalls, it could pave the way for renewed interest across altcoins more widely. Quiet confidence in Ethereum often acts as a bellwether—and this shift, if it holds, could be the first real hint that alt season isn’t far behind. Best Crypto to Buy Now as Altcoins Expect a Boost SUBBD With Ether’s ETPs soaking up liquidity, attention is clearly shifting toward assets that offer more than price action—and SUBBD fits squarely into that narrative. Built as a token that reimagines the creator economy, SUBBD allows content creators to monetize directly through blockchain-backed loyalty, subscriptions, and ownership models. It isn’t a passive asset—it’s designed for interaction, activity, and value exchange between creators and their communities. In a climate where capital is beginning to look beyond Bitcoin’s slow movements and Ether’s recovery, projects like SUBBD carry particular relevance. The platform gives creators complete control without middlemen, while fans gain tokenized access to exclusive perks and long-term engagement incentives. Every subscription or contribution is recorded transparently, turning fan support into something with both emotional and financial resonance. Recent Ether ETP inflows suggest investors are open to smart contract-driven platforms with actual use cases—an encouraging backdrop for a project like SUBBD that operates entirely on-chain. While Bitcoin struggles with short-term volatility and seasonal hesitations, SUBBD benefits from steadily growing utility and an expanding list of creators opting in. As the market tests which assets can retain momentum in uncertain phases, utility-driven tokens may gain the upper hand. SUBBD’s structure is geared toward consistency, not speculation—and in a week where Ether saw inflows of over $300 million, that signals a broader willingness to back projects with actual value propositions. SUBBD isn’t chasing hype—it’s offering architecture. Solaxy While Ethereum ETPs absorb investor flows and Bitcoin ETFs show signs of strain, a quiet recalibration seems to be underway—and Solaxy lands right in that pocket of renewed investor interest. The project is structured as a Layer 2 that supports both Ethereum and Solana ecosystems, offering faster transactions, cross-chain compatibility, and strong staking incentives through its native SOLX token. In a week where Ethereum gained favor due to its ecosystem strength, Solaxy’s premise of amplifying L1 capabilities feels timely. SOLX staking delivers robust rewards without locking users into long-term illiquidity. The APY is backed by protocol activity and ecosystem incentives, not arbitrary emissions, which makes it more attractive to those looking for sustainable passive returns. Ether’s recent inflow strength shows that appetite for high-utility, smart-contract-compatible platforms is returning. Investors who may have missed Ethereum’s recent entry point are already exploring adjacent narratives, and Solaxy—by enhancing the very infrastructure ETH operates on—is positioned as a natural next step. As market participants re-evaluate their portfolios, projects that support scalability, low fees, and fluid interoperability are likely to stand out. $SOLX is showing NO signs of slowing down! 🚀43M Raised! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/kktQdy34kA — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) June 1, 2025 The project has raised upwards of $43 million, which makes it one of the biggest utility memecoin presales this year. Solaxy doesn’t try to fight ETH or SOL—it tries to make them better. And that cooperative value proposition is exactly what capital seems to favor right now. The broader takeaway from the Ether inflow data is that the market is leaning toward structured, function-driven projects—and Solaxy’s blueprint fits that shift with precision. Snorter As Ether’s resurgence triggers inflows into ETPs and reignites belief in solid infrastructure projects, some investors are shifting focus toward functional tools that enhance trading itself—enter Snorter . It’s a Telegram-based trading assistant designed to help users scan, snipe, and act on token launches within seconds, particularly across the Solana ecosystem. In short: it’s not a meme, it’s a mechanism. While the broader market shuffles around BTC hesitation and ETH inflow momentum, Snorter’s appeal lies in its timing. With retail attention once again fixating on altcoins, tools that reduce friction and increase execution speed become invaluable. The bot doesn’t just offer token tracking—it simplifies complex moves into one-tap actions, letting traders act swiftly in a space where seconds often define success. Ether’s recent performance proved one thing clearly: function is finding favor again. Investors are looking at what a project does, not just what it represents. Snorter leans hard into that mentality, offering real-world utility instead of promises. As a tool crafted for this exact kind of market phase—volatile, opportunity-laden, and moving fast—it provides a tactical edge to anyone navigating presales or early launches. The idea behind Snorter isn’t new, but the execution is cleaner, faster, and aligned with trader priorities. In a time when ETH is being re-evaluated for its functionality and resilience, projects like Snorter remind us that infrastructure isn’t just about blockchains—it’s also about access, precision, and how quickly you can move when the window opens. BTC Bull With the recent developments within the crypto space, one thing becomes obvious- a pattern is beginning to take shape, with investors not just seeking the big names anymore. They’re looking for projects that actually offer something valuable. BTC Bull is built with that exact philosophy in mind. Rather than offering exposure to Bitcoin alone, it links its own token utility to Bitcoin’s price movements in real time, transforming BTC’s rally phases into direct user rewards. The concept is straightforward, yet surprisingly absent in many Bitcoin-aligned projects. BTC Bull distributes airdrops to token holders whenever Bitcoin crosses predetermined price thresholds. As BTC climbs, so do the perks—creating a system that rewards bullish sentiment rather than just tracking it. At the same time, a built-in token burn mechanism ensures that supply tightens alongside rising participation, preserving value over time and encouraging long-term holding behavior. This is particularly relevant now, as capital seems to be rotating away from passive Bitcoin products and toward altcoins or hybrid assets offering additional layers of functionality. BTC Bull doesn’t abandon Bitcoin—it amplifies it, offering holders a way to participate in the upside without relying on leverage or ETFs. Top YouTube channels like 99Bitcoins , along with other top websites and creators, have also endorsed the project strongly in recent weeks. Ether’s ETP success this week showed that investor confidence is returning to assets with solid mechanics and measurable performance. BTC Bull taps into that shift with a model that isn’t speculative fluff—it’s designed to move with Bitcoin, but pay you for the ride. In a post-ETP world, that kind of proactive utility is exactly what many are hunting for. Conclusion In a week where Ether’s resurgence has reshaped where capital is flowing, it’s becoming clear that investor interest is gravitating toward utility, structure, and timing rather than blind speculation. With traditional Bitcoin products seeing fatigue and altcoin-linked platforms gaining traction, the right move now may lie in projects that respond actively to market momentum. For those seeking exposure with purpose, the entries above may offer a stronger footing in what’s shaping up to be a crucial phase in the cycle.

2025-06-02T14:20:21,"UK Crypto Trading Unlocks Exciting New Era for Retail Investors via IG Group","BitcoinWorld UK Crypto Trading Unlocks Exciting New Era for Retail Investors via IG Group Big news is brewing for the world of UK crypto trading ! A major player in the financial services industry, IG Group, has officially opened the doors to spot cryptocurrency trading for its retail client base. This development marks a significant step in making direct crypto asset ownership more accessible within the United Kingdom’s regulated financial landscape. For many prospective investors, this provides a new, potentially simpler pathway to engage with digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. What Does the New IG Group Crypto Offering Mean for You? IG Group, a company listed on the UK stock exchange with a long history in trading services, announced on June 2 that its customers can now directly buy and sell a selection of cryptocurrencies. This isn’t just about trading derivatives; it’s about accessing the underlying assets themselves. This move into IG Group crypto trading is facilitated through a strategic partnership with Uphold, a U.S.-based digital asset platform that holds regulatory status in both the United States and the United Kingdom. This collaboration is key, leveraging Uphold’s infrastructure and regulatory standing to offer the service. The initial rollout provides access to 31 different cryptocurrencies. This selection includes the heavy hitters and some newer, popular coins: Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) XRP Solana (SOL) Cardano (ADA) Polygon (MATIC) Polkadot (DOT) Litecoin (LTC) Popular memecoins like Bonk (BONK) The list is designed to offer a decent breadth of the market, from established large-caps to some of the more speculative, trending assets. For those looking to diversify or simply get started, having this range available through a familiar provider like IG Group is a notable advantage. Why is Spot Crypto Trading Gaining Traction Among Retail Crypto Investors? Historically, many traditional brokers offered crypto exposure primarily through derivatives like CFDs (Contracts For Difference). While these instruments allow speculation on price movements, they don’t involve owning the actual cryptocurrency. Spot crypto trading , however, means you are buying and selling the real asset. When you buy Bitcoin on a spot market, you own Bitcoin. This direct ownership is often preferred by long-term holders or those who wish to potentially use their crypto for transactions or other purposes beyond pure price speculation. For retail crypto investors in the UK, this shift offers several potential benefits: Direct Ownership: You hold the actual digital asset. Simplicity: For many, the concept of buying and holding an asset is more straightforward than understanding derivative contracts. Accessibility: Integrating crypto trading into an existing IG Group account simplifies the onboarding process for current customers. Regulatory Clarity (via Partner): The partnership with Uphold, a regulated entity in the UK, provides a layer of confidence regarding compliance and operational standards. This move by IG Group reflects a growing demand from their client base and the broader market trend towards providing more direct access to digital assets. Can You Now Easily Trade Bitcoin UK and Other Cryptos? Yes, the launch means that for IG Group’s UK customers, the ability to Trade Bitcoin UK , along with Ethereum, XRP, and 28 other cryptocurrencies, is now integrated into their platform. This significantly lowers the barrier to entry for individuals who might already be trading other asset classes like stocks, indices, or forex with IG Group. Instead of needing to open accounts on separate, dedicated crypto exchanges, they can potentially manage a portion of their digital asset portfolio alongside their traditional investments. Getting started typically involves: Logging into your IG Group account (or opening one). Navigating to the crypto trading section. Completing any necessary additional verification steps required for crypto services. Funding your account. Placing buy or sell orders for the available cryptocurrencies. The partnership with Uphold handles the underlying execution and custody of the digital assets, streamlining the process for the end user. What Does This Mean for the Future of Spot Crypto Trading in the UK? IG Group’s entry into spot crypto trading is a strong signal about the increasing institutional confidence in the digital asset space, even within the UK’s evolving regulatory framework. As more established financial firms offer direct crypto access, it could lead to increased liquidity, greater market maturity, and potentially attract a wider pool of investors who prefer to trade through well-known, regulated entities. While this is a positive development for accessibility, it’s crucial for retail crypto investors to remember the inherent risks involved in cryptocurrency markets. Prices can be highly volatile, and investments can lose value rapidly. Education about the specific assets being traded and understanding market dynamics remains paramount. Conclusion: A New Chapter for UK Crypto Trading The launch of spot crypto trading by IG Group, in partnership with Uphold, represents a notable advancement for the UK crypto trading landscape. By offering direct access to 31 cryptocurrencies, including the ability to Trade Bitcoin UK easily, IG Group is catering to the growing demand from its retail crypto investors . This move into spot crypto trading through a regulated partner like Uphold provides a more integrated and potentially more comfortable route into the digital asset market for many. As this service rolls out, it will be interesting to see its impact on the broader adoption of cryptocurrencies among mainstream UK investors.

2025-06-02T14:10:17,"Nervos Network Suffers Shocking $3M Crypto Hack","BitcoinWorld Nervos Network Suffers Shocking $3M Crypto Hack Alarming news has emerged from the world of blockchain as the Nervos Network , a project focused on building a robust Bitcoin Layer-2 solution, has reportedly fallen victim to a significant crypto hack . This incident, highlighted by blockchain security firm Cyver Alerts, underscores the persistent challenges in maintaining ironclad blockchain security in an interconnected digital asset ecosystem. What Happened During the Nervos Network Crypto Hack? According to an alert shared by Cyver Alerts on the social media platform X, suspicious activity was detected involving the Nervos Network ‘s bridge. The firm indicated that an unknown attacker managed to gain control of this critical piece of infrastructure, which facilitates the movement of assets between different blockchain environments. The result was a substantial loss: approximately $3 million worth of crypto assets were stolen. The specific tokens targeted in this sophisticated attack included a variety of stablecoins and major cryptocurrencies: 257,800 USDT 539.09 ETH 898,300 USDC 60,400 DAI 0.79 WBTC This diverse haul demonstrates the attacker’s aim to acquire high-value, liquid assets. Understanding the Crypto Bridge Exploit So, what exactly is a crypto bridge exploit , and why are bridges often targeted? Blockchain bridges are essential tools in the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. They allow users to transfer tokens and data between different blockchains, solving the crucial problem of interoperability. For instance, a bridge might let you use Bitcoin (BTC) on the Ethereum network or move assets from a Layer-1 chain like Ethereum to a Layer-2 solution like Nervos Network. However, bridges are complex pieces of software and infrastructure. They often involve locking assets on one chain and minting wrapped representations on another, or relying on validator networks to confirm transactions across chains. This complexity creates potential vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit flaws in smart contracts, compromise validator keys, or manipulate the underlying logic of the bridge to steal the locked assets. Bridge exploits have unfortunately become a recurring theme in blockchain security incidents, accounting for hundreds of millions, sometimes billions, of dollars in losses across various networks. The Nervos Network incident adds to this concerning trend. The Attacker’s Next Move: Leveraging Tornado Cash Following the successful theft, the attacker reportedly converted all the stolen assets – including the stablecoins and WBTC – into Ethereum (ETH). This consolidated sum of ETH was then transferred to Tornado Cash (TORN), a well-known crypto mixing protocol. Tornado Cash is designed to obfuscate the origin and destination of cryptocurrency transactions by pooling funds from many users and then allowing them to withdraw from the pool. While proponents argue it’s a tool for privacy, it has frequently been used by malicious actors, including those behind major hacks, to launder stolen funds and make them difficult to trace. The use of Tornado Cash in the Nervos Network crypto hack suggests the attacker is attempting to cover their tracks and evade identification and recovery efforts. How Did the Nervos Network Team Respond? In the wake of discovering the suspicious activity and confirming the crypto bridge exploit , the Nervos Network team took immediate action. Their primary response was to pause all smart contracts associated with the compromised bridge or potentially affected parts of the network. This is a standard emergency procedure designed to prevent further losses or ongoing malicious activity. Simultaneously, the team initiated a full investigation into the incident. This involves working with blockchain security experts like Cyver Alerts, analyzing transaction logs, identifying the root cause of the vulnerability, and potentially coordinating with law enforcement or exchanges, although recovering funds sent to mixers like Tornado Cash is notoriously difficult. What Does This Incident Mean for Blockchain Security? The Nervos Network crypto hack serves as another stark reminder of the inherent risks in the rapidly evolving blockchain space. Despite continuous advancements, vulnerabilities persist, particularly in complex cross-chain infrastructure like bridges. Key takeaways for blockchain security from this event include: Bridge Risks: Bridges remain high-value targets due to the significant liquidity they manage and their technical complexity. Layer-2 Security: While Layer-2 solutions aim to improve scalability, their security is often intertwined with Layer-1 and the mechanisms used for bridging assets between layers. The Challenge of Mixers: Protocols like Tornado Cash continue to pose significant challenges for tracing and recovering stolen funds, complicating the work of investigators and victims. Importance of Monitoring: The detection by a security firm highlights the critical role of constant, sophisticated monitoring of network activity. Challenges and Actionable Insights for Users and Projects For users interacting with the Nervos Network or any other blockchain project, incidents like this reinforce the need for caution. While Nervos is investigating, users should stay informed via official channels. More broadly, when using bridges or interacting with DeFi protocols, it’s crucial to understand the associated risks. Diversifying assets and not keeping excessive funds on single platforms or bridges is a prudent strategy. For blockchain projects, especially those operating bridges or Layer-2 solutions, the Nervos Network crypto hack emphasizes the absolute necessity of: Rigorous Audits: Regular, independent security audits of smart contracts and infrastructure are paramount. Bug Bounties: Incentivizing white-hat hackers to find vulnerabilities before malicious actors do. Real-time Monitoring: Implementing systems to detect unusual activity quickly. Incident Response Plans: Having clear procedures in place for pausing operations, investigating, and communicating with the community during an exploit. The challenge of recovering funds once they enter mixers like Tornado Cash is immense, making preventative blockchain security measures the most critical line of defense. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for Blockchain Security The reported Nervos Network crypto hack , resulting in a $3 million loss via a crypto bridge exploit and the subsequent use of Tornado Cash , is a significant event for the community. It serves as a powerful reminder that the digital frontier of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, while innovative, is also a battleground for blockchain security . As the Nervos team continues its investigation, the broader industry must learn from these incidents, constantly enhancing security protocols and fostering a culture of vigilance to protect users and the integrity of decentralized networks.

2025-06-02T14:09:13,"GameStop: The Next MSTR?","Summary GameStop has pivoted into a Bitcoin investment company, investing about 10% of its $4.7B cash pile into Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Unlike MicroStrategy, GME is buying Bitcoin near all-time highs, making rapid gains less likely and increasing risk compared to MSTR's earlier entry. The core business continues to shrink rapidly, with declining sales and store closures, and profits are mostly from interest on cash reserves. Given the lack of clarity on GME's Bitcoin strategy and the risks involved, I rate the stock a 'hold' and will monitor for further developments. Gamestop ( GME ) has pivoted into a crypto investment company. This was always the most likely course of action as it explored options for its $4B cash pile. But has it unlocked value for shareholders? This article looks at how Strategy ( MSTR ) leads the way, but will be hard to replicate. The Pivot The company outlined plans to invest in Bitcoin in March. On March 25, 2025 we announced that, as part of our revisions to the Investment Policy, the Board approved the addition of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, whereby a portion of our cash or future debt and equity issuances may be invested in Bitcoin. We have not set a maximum amount of Bitcoin we may accumulate, and may sell any Bitcoin we may acquire. On May 28th, confirmed they purchased 4,710 Bitcoin. Assuming a cost of $90-100K, GME spent $420-471M on the position. That's about one-tenth of the cash pile, last reported to be $4.7B. GME That's all the information the company have released on the matter so far. CEO Ryan Cohen recently said the purchase of Bitcoin was a ""currency hedge."" It sounds like he may be distracting from the company's pivot, but perhaps he is right. GME has held over $4B in cash (and I assume USTs) for nearly a year now. Diversifying into other currencies with the potential to grow the holding is a reasonable approach, if a risky one. Cohen also said he would not call out GME's crypto strategy in advance, and would follow its own path instead of copying an existing player such as Strategy ( MSTR ). This could mean all sorts of things - perhaps GME won't copy MSTR's approach to raising capital to acquire Bitcoin. However, I assume they will at least have a similar approach to buy and record Bitcoin on the balance sheet. It will be interesting to see if the buying is steady or if there is any kind of strategy. Will they invest the whole $4.7B? There are still a lot of questions, and Strategy's Bitcoin Initiative - Project Roadmap is a useful source of information on some of the steps that could be taken. Indeed, the guide seems tailor-made for GME. MicroStrategy is sharing its learnings and methodologies so that other organizations can successfully navigate the adoption of bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. A lot of the information relates to managing risk and governance. GME will need to establish storage solutions and have a custodian for acquired Bitcoins. Here's a sample of what may be going on behind the scenes if GME follows a similar route to MSTR. Strategy Being able to follow in the footsteps of MSTR is an advantage, although you could say MSTR's assistance is not completely altruistic - GME and any other company to now pivot into Bitcoin investments will indirectly help MSTR as it will increase demand and potentially push up Bitcoin prices. Before pivoting into Bitcoin investments, MSTR was a software company focused on data mining and enterprise analytics. The stock never managed to recover from the huge boom and bust pattern in the 2000 era. Tradingview Revenues were shrinking in the 5 years before the 2020 Bitcoin initiative. Data by YCharts You could say there are similarities between GME and MSTR around the time they pivoted into Bitcoin investments. The key difference is that GME is starting its purchases when Bitcoin is trading near all-time highs around $100K. When MSTR first launched its Bitcoin initiative in 2020, prices were near $10K following a crash. I won't make a call on future Bitcoin prices, but it is well-known that the best price gains are made when assets recover from a crash, not when they are already trading near all-time highs. It is therefore unlikely that GME will make a rapid rise like MSTR did in 2020. I don't want to make too many comparisons between MSTR and GME as they may end up with completely different strategies. After all, GME has only invested one-tenth of its cash in Bitcoin and may do something completely different with the rest. However, there is something else we can learn from MSTR in relation to valuation: MSTR has always traded at a large premium to NAV. Strategy Tracker The premium has narrowed to around 1.7x, but was as high as 3x in November last year when there was a large Bitcoin rally and bullish sentiment in the crypto space. GME has a lofty valuation of $13B given its shrinking underlying business, but it may not seem quite as lofty if it were to hold $4B in Bitcoin and Bitcoin was in a bullish phase. Data by YCharts Do I think GME should be valued at $13B if it has a $4.7B holding in Bitcoin? No, but if the Bitcoin price doubled and management displayed an effective strategy, then it might not be too far off. The Rest of the Business Ryan Cohen joined the board of directors in 2021 and became CEO in 2023. He recently said GameStop was a ""piece of crap"" and losing a lot of money when he took over. I wouldn't argue with that assessment, but I get the impression that Cohen still thinks it is a piece of crap and is not that interested in the core business. The FY results confirmed another significant decrease in sales. During fiscal 2024, total net sales decreased 27.5% compared to the prior year, with net sales in our Europe, Canada, United States, and Australia segments decreasing by 38.0%, 30.2%, 24.9%, and 22.5%, respectively, compared to the prior year. The decrease in consolidated net sales in fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to a $516.6 million or 33.9% decline in the sales of software, a $897.1 million or 29.9% decline in the sale of hardware and accessories, and a $36.1 million or 4.8% decline in the sales of collectibles. Locations are shrinking, and they closed around half of European stores last year. GME One of the financial highlights was: Completed divestiture of Italy and the wind-down of store operations in Germany. We can see the way this is likely going and GME may operate only in the U.S. in the coming years. The company is making small profits, but this is mostly due to the interest income from its large cash holding (likely invested in UST Bills). Interest income, net increased $113.9 million to $163.4 million in fiscal 2024, compared to $49.5 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in cash and cash equivalents resulting from the issuance and sale of shares of our Class A Common Stock under the ATM Transactions, as well as higher interest rates in the current year compared to the prior year. Take away income expenses, and there is a small $30M loss for the year. GME This probably suits management. If the legacy business is small, easily managed, and more or less breaking even, the pivot into other investment areas could be smoother. Conclusions GME has invested around one-tenth of its cash pile in Bitcoin, and it seems to be pivoting into a Bitcoin holdings company. Meanwhile, the legacy business continues to shrink at a rapid pace. CEO Ryan Cohen has not outlined the company's Bitcoin strategy yet, but we can assume it will be similar to MSTR - accumulate as much Bitcoin as possible and hope it goes up in price. This has potential, but MSTR's successful pivot in 2020 was helped massively by the preceding Bitcoin crash of 80%. Huge gains were made on the recovery to new highs. GME is not in the same situation, and with Bitcoin trading near all-time highs, the gains could be limited. GME is at an interesting stage of development and is worth monitoring, but until we know more about the Bitcoin strategy, I will not be rushing to buy and rate it a ""hold.""",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4791684-gamestop-the-next-mstr?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","MSTR|GME",cryptocompare

2025-06-02T14:04:21,"Metaplanet Buys 1,088 BTC, Entering Top 10 Corporate Holders","This latest purchase allowed Metaplanet to surpass both Galaxy Digital and Block Inc. in corporate Bitcoin holdings. The acquisition also proves that there is still rising institutional confidence despite Bitcoin's recent volatility. Meanwhile, Strategy, led by Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor, acquired an additional 705 BTC for $75.1 million during the price dip, pushing its total holdings to a staggering 580,955 BTC. This stockpile is valued at over $40 billion. Strategy’s continued accumulation strategy is drawing a lot of attention, especially after a director’s share sale. Despite turbulent markets, crypto investment products saw $286 million in inflows last week, which was the seventh consecutive week of capital inflows. While Bitcoin ETPs experienced slight outflows, Ethereum investment products surged and netted $321 million in their strongest week since late 2024. Metaplanet Buys More BTC Japanese investment firm Metaplanet became the world’s eighth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin after another major purchase. In a June 2 post on X , the company announced the acquisition of 1,088 BTC at an average price of $108,400 per coin, totaling $117.9 million. This latest investment brings Metaplanet’s total holdings to 8,888 BTC, placing it ahead of Galaxy Digital’s 8,100 BTC and Block Inc.’s 8,485 BTC, according to Bitbo data . The move is impressive not only for its size but also for the price point, which was over $100,000 per BTC. This could mean that the company has deepening institutional confidence in the ongoing bull market. Largest Bitcoin holders (Source: Bitbo ) The purchase also happened against a backdrop of rising economic uncertainty, particularly in Japan’s bond markets, where yield spikes are raising concerns over fiscal stability and sovereign debt risk. According to Bitwise’s head of European research, André Dragosch, current default probabilities across G20 bonds support a Bitcoin valuation above $200,000. Bitcoin itself recently reached an all-time high above $112,000 on May 22 before pulling back to around $105,464. Analysts at Bitfinex consider this consolidation healthy as it provides a foundation for a potential next leg up, especially if Bitcoin continues to hold above its short-term holder cost basis of around $95,000. They believe the coming weeks will be pivotal in determining whether the recent highs were a local peak or the beginning of a broader Q3 rally. However, some analysts are warning people over the speculative enthusiasm surrounding Bitcoin-linked equities. Metaplanet’s own stock surged to the point where it’s trading at a $596,000 Bitcoin premium . This means that investors are effectively paying more than five times the spot price of BTC via exposure to Metaplanet shares. (Source: 10xResearch ) Strategy Also Adds More BTC to Its Treasury Strategy, the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, also recently confirmed another major BTC acquisition as part of its aggressive buying strategy. The company is led by Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, and revealed that it purchased 705 Bitcoin between May 26 and May 30 for a total of $75.1 million. The acquisition was completed at an average price of $106,495 per coin. This means that Strategy took advantage of the temporary Bitcoin price dip , which fell from $110,000 early last week to an intraweek low of around $103,400 by the weekend. This latest purchase was Strategy’s final addition to its Bitcoin treasury for the month of May, and brings its total holdings to an unprecedented 580,955 BTC. The total value of these holdings, which were acquired at a blended average cost of $70,023 per coin, now amounts to approximately $40.68 billion. This very firmly cements Strategy’s position as the largest Bitcoin-holding public company by a huge margin. The announcement coincides with a series of share sales by Strategy director Jarrod Patten, which raised some questions about insider sentiment. According to a May 30 securities filing, Patten sold 3,750 shares of Strategy’s Class A stock over the course of a week between May 22 and May 29. These transactions occurred just as the company was finalizing its latest Bitcoin purchases. The sales applied additional pressure to Strategy’s stock price, which briefly dipped below $360 on May 28 and May 30. However, the stock rebounded slightly to close the week at $369, though it remained 1.6% down in pre-market trading. Strategy stock price YTD (Source: Google ) Despite recent volatility, Strategy’s stock is still up on the year after gaining 23% year-to-date and boasting an impressive 123% gain over the past twelve months. Overall, the company’s steadfast accumulation strategy is being closely watched by both institutional investors and crypto market participants, especially as Strategy’s purchases now occur at price levels well above the average cost basis. Investors Keep Buying Crypto Meanwhile, crypto investment products continued to attract capital last week despite heavy market volatility and a sharp decline in Bitcoin’s price. According to a June 2 report by CoinShares, digital asset exchange-traded products (ETPs) saw $286 million in inflows for the week ending May 30. This was the seventh consecutive week of inflows, and pushed the total over that period to $10.9 billion. (Source: CoinShares ) However, the broader market decline led to a drop in total assets under management (AUM) from a record $187 billion to $177 billion. CoinShares’ head of research, James Butterfill, attributed the drop in AUM to growing market concerns over geopolitical factors, including US tariff uncertainty. Bitcoin tumbled from $110,000, which also contributed to a modest outflow of $8 million from BTC investment products. Despite the outflows, long-term sentiment toward Bitcoin is still cautiously optimistic, though analysts pointed out that June tends to be a historically mixed month for the crypto market, which could add to short-term instability. (Source: CoinShares ) Meanwhile, Ethereum-based investment products led the pack with $321 million in inflows. Which was its strongest flow since December of 2024. This renewed demand happened after ETH’s long underperformance earlier in the year, which even led some trading firms to compare its behavior to that of meme coins. With ETH currently trading around $2,486, it gained 36% over the past 30 days. Other crypto products showed diverging trends. XRP investment vehicles posted outflows for the second consecutive week by shedding $28 million. BlackRock’s iShares ETFs continued to lead all issuers with $790 million in inflows despite witnessing a sharp end-of-week drop in its Bitcoin ETF products. Year-to-date, iShares’ inflows reached $12.4 billion, although their AUM slipped from $74.8 billion to $72.9 billion. Conversely, ARK Invest and 21Shares saw the largest issuer-level outflows last week, with combined losses of $282 million and total yearly outflows now standing at $22 million. The flow reversal across Bitcoin products is being linked to profit-taking activity, seasonal weakness, and broader macroeconomic concerns.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9400/metaplanet-buys-1-088-btc-entering-top-10-corporate-holders,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-06-02T14:03:52,"How James Wynn's $100M Implosion Is Familiar Leverage Tale","Derivatives trader James Wynn emerged out of the woodworks a few weeks ago, flaunting 9-figure bitcoin positions on HyperLiquid as he went on a seemingly undefeatable run that culminated in around $100 million worth of profit. But that run, as is often the case with highly-leveraged crypto derivative trading, came to a shocking end — Wynn liquidated his entire account despite BTC only moving by a couple of percent. ""I've decided to give perp trading a break,"" Wynn wrote on X after the final blow up. ""Its been a fun ride. Approximately $4 million into $100 million and then back down to a total account loss of $17.5 million."" Wynn's story is nothing new. In 2021, for instance, the industry saw the public rise of Alex Wice — a poker player turned derivatives trader — that also lost $100 million after making huge bets with leverage. And even in 2017, in the BitMEX trollbox days, pseudonymous figures like SteveS and TheBoot used to boast about their 10s of millions in profit and loss before forever fading into obscurity. The problem with crypto derivatives Cryptocurrency derivatives can be an incredibly useful tool; if a trader holds 500 BTC ($52 million) and believes the market will go down, they can hedge their position by going short -- reducing exposure without having to sell their spot assets, which in itself could cause slippage or front running. An array of delta neutral strategies can also be employed like the classic basis trade that became popular amongst institutional traders on the bitcoin CME futures market, which involve simultaneously going long and short to harvest the funding rate as a yield. But issues begin to form when crypto traders, the majority of whom are inexperienced retail traders, use platforms that offer up to 100x leverage. Imagine a newcomer had $5,000 in trading capital, sure, they could make a few intraday trades and make $50 or $100 per trade, but if they used 100x they could make $50,000 per 10% move. This is the slippery slope of gambling-induced emotional trading that many fall into. Data from NewTrading shows that just 3% of day traders make a profit and 1% do so consistently. And the game becomes even tougher when, in this case, traders are opening positions worth hundreds of millions of dollars. James Wynn exists the casino James Wynn's downfall came in part due to his inability to deal with the emotional swings of trading, but also the sheer size of his positions. Wynn would often post about getting partially liquidated and re-opening the position at a worse break-even point. This is indicative of a trader out of his depth through over-leverage. As Wynn used in some cases 40x leverage, his liquidation point left no margin for error, this meant that astute traders or trading firms could hunt his liquidation point and force him into an impulsive trade. HyperLiquid is a relatively liquid derivatives venue, it has millions in market depth within 1% of an asset's price but it does not have hundreds of million, which was required to absorb Wynn's leveraged positions. In reality, Wynn's trade thesis was based around the Bitcoin Las Vegas event and any potential announcements that could lift bitcoin above a new record high. If this came into fruition, Wynn would have had hundreds of millions in unrealized profit, but unfortunately in his case, bitcoin began to slump during the conference as speeches from Michael Saylor and Ross Ulbricht failed to spark any upside momentum. The lack of volatility and Wynn's insatiable appetite to keep betting led to him getting chopped out of the market. His losses became so notable that one trader decided to counter trade every position by going short at the same time as Wynn went long, this trader made $17 million, according to Lookonchain . As the sun finally set on Wynn's derivatives journey he announced he was ""going back to the trenches"" to trade meme coins, of course.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/02/how-james-wynn-s-usd100m-implosion-is-a-leverage-tale-as-old-as-time,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX","Markets|Cryptocurrency Derivatives|perpetual contracts|Futures|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-02T14:02:32,"Russia’s biggest bank bets on Bitcoin with new bond offering","Sberbank, the largest financial institution in Russia, has unveiled a new investment product tied to Bitcoin ( BTC ), marking a major step toward integrating cryptocurrency exposure within the country’s regulated financial system. The product, a structured bond , tracks the value of Bitcoin and is designed for qualified investors seeking crypto-linked returns without directly owning or storing digital assets. Returns on the bond are influenced by two factors: Bitcoin’s performance against the U.S. dollar and any potential appreciation of the dollar versus the Russian ruble. Unlike traditional cryptocurrency investments, investors can gain exposure to Bitcoin without setting up a crypto wallet or using offshore exchanges. All transactions are settled in rubles and handled entirely within Russia’s domestic financial infrastructure. Sberbank plans to expand crypto offering Sberbank also confirmed plans to expand this offering. According to the bank, similar crypto-linked structured instruments will be made available on the Moscow Exchange in the near future. In addition, its investment division, SberInvestments, will roll out a new Bitcoin futures product on June 4, aligning with a broader launch by the Moscow Exchange. The move comes just days after the Bank of Russia greenlit the offering of cryptocurrency-based financial instruments to professional investors, signaling a notable policy shift amid growing demand for regulated exposure to digital assets.

2025-06-02T14:00:38,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Bears Target $100,000 As Bulls Struggle To Regain Foothold","Bitcoin (BTC) has started the week in the red despite a weekend recovery that lifted the price from a low of $103,199 to beyond $105,000. However, the flagship cryptocurrency lost the $105,000 level during the ongoing session and is trading around $104,130. BTC closed below its daily support level on Thursday, slipping below the 20-day SMA to $105,662. It extended its losses on Friday and is down over 5% in the past week. Silk Road Founder Did Not Donate Bitcoin To Himself Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht recently received a significant donation of 300 BTC , leading many to speculate he donated the coins to himself. However, on-chain investigator ZachXBT has revealed that while the donated Bitcoin came from questionable sources, it is unlikely to be a case where Ulbricht donated to himself. Ulbricht had been soliciting donations and received 300 Bitcoin worth $31.4 million, according to data from Lookonchain. The donated Bitcoin came from a wallet using a mixing service called Jambler, leading to speculation that the funds were from hidden profits from Silk Road. However, ZachXBT was skeptical that this was the case because “very few entities use Jambler.” He also claimed he found a potential demix for the donation. “It likely doesn’t appear to be a self-donation as people were claiming though it comes from questionable sources due to the flagged address.” The on-chain investigator also stated that one of the addresses involved had exchange activity going back to late 2014, while another was active in 2019. “Both were depositing in size to Jambler at similar times as the 300 BTC Ross donor received from Jambler. Both had dormant BTC from Nov 2019 until the mixer deposits made from April to May 2025. Everyone was accusing Ross of a self-donation, so if anything, this proves it was a donation and not his secret stash because there was activity when he was away in prison.” Buying Bitcoin Will Get Harder Strategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor believes it will get exponentially harder to purchase Bitcoin as more large companies and corporate entities pivot towards the asset. This week, Trump Media Group announced plans to allocate $2.4 billion to buy Bitcoin and build a treasury. Meanwhile, Tether, Softbank, and Strike’s Jack Maller launched Twenty One, with plans to add 42,000 BTC to its balance sheet. Metaplanet also announced its latest Bitcoin purchase, adding 1,088 BTC to its holdings. While shares of some of these companies have declined, Saylor maintained that holding Bitcoin on balance sheets has proved to be extremely popular. Saylor believes it will become exponentially harder to buy Bitcoin, with the Strategy co-founder bullish on the flagship cryptocurrency’s prospects. “Bitcoin is an idea whose time has come, and no force on earth can stop it.” However, not everyone is on board. Microsoft has rejected the idea of adding Bitcoin to its reserves, with Meta shareholders also rejecting the idea this week. However, Saylor said Strategy will continue buying Bitcoin, stating, “We think it will get exponentially harder to buy Bitcoin, but we will work exponentially more efficiently to buy Bitcoin.” Metaplanet Announces Latest Bitcoin Purchase Japanese investment company Metaplanet has become the world’s eighth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin (BTC) after announcing its latest purchase worth $117.9 million. The company’s latest purchase makes it the world’s ninth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin as it continues its aggressive buying strategy. Metaplanet announced the purchase of 1,088 Bitcoin for $117.9 million at an average price of $108,400, taking its total holdings to over 8,888 BTC . “Metaplanet Acquires Additional 1,088 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 8,888 BTC .” Corporate purchases of Bitcoin indicate growing institutional interest and confidence in the asset and the current bull market cycle. Metaplanet’s purchase comes amid rising uncertainty in Japan’s bond markets. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to regain momentum after suffering a substantial decline last week. The flagship cryptocurrency recovered over the weekend, but not before dropping to a low of $103,199. Analysts have stated that a decline was expected after the rally as long-term holders locked in their profits, with buyer exhaustion also weighing the price down. With sellers gaining the upper hand, BTC could dip to $100,000 or lower if current sentiment persists. However, analysts are unanimous in stating that the current pullback should not be viewed as a bearish signal, indicating it is an excellent buying opportunity. “This potential pullback should not be viewed solely as a sign of weakness. In many bull cycles, such corrections and shakeouts serve to flush out over-leveraged positions and reset sentiment, ultimately laying the groundwork for renewed upward momentum.” BTC’s consolidation phase can be a healthy development, providing the market with a sustainable foundation for the next leg of its rally as leveraged positions reset and spot demand consolidates. Bitfinex analysts stated, “Bitcoinʼs ability to continue to consolidate above its short-term holder cost basis around $95,000 remains key. The coming weeks will likely determine whether Bitcoinʼs latest breakout was a local high or the prelude to a more aggressive leg higher in Q3.” BTC registered a sharp decline on Friday, dropping nearly 4% and settling at $107,346. The price recovered over the weekend despite the selling pressure, rising 0.56% on Saturday and 1.16% on Sunday to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,103. The price continued pushing higher on Monday, registering a marginal increase and settling at $109,453. However, it was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping 0.46% to slip below $109,000 and settle at $108,954. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell 1.03% and settled at $107,834. Source: TradingView Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as BTC fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,662. Selling pressure persisted on Friday as BTC fell 1.51%, falling below $105,000 and settling at $104,067. Despite the overwhelming bearish sentiment, BTC recovered on Saturday, rising 0.69% to $104,784. The price continued to push higher on Sunday, increasing nearly 1% to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,775. However, BTC is back in the red during the ongoing session, with the price down almost 2%, slipping below $105,000 and trading around $104,100. If sellers retain control, BTC could slip to $100,000 or lower. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-02T14:00:15,"BitoPro Crypto Exchange Suspected $11.5M Security Breach Alarms Users","BitcoinWorld BitoPro Crypto Exchange Suspected $11.5M Security Breach Alarms Users News is circulating in the crypto world about a potential major security incident involving a prominent Asian crypto exchange . According to reports from well-known on-chain analyst ZachXBT, Taiwan-based BitoPro may have suffered a significant loss of funds due to a suspected security breach. What Happened at the BitoPro Crypto Exchange? The alleged incident reportedly took place on May 8th, raising concerns about the security posture of BitoPro . While details are still emerging and the exchange has not yet made a public statement confirming the breach, the on-chain evidence points towards suspicious activity. ZachXBT, known for his detailed investigations into crypto scams and hacks, highlighted unusual movements of assets from several of BitoPro’s hot wallets. The suspected loss is estimated to be around $11.5 million in various digital assets. This figure, if confirmed, represents a substantial amount for any exchange and immediately brings the focus back onto the critical importance of robust security measures in the cryptocurrency space. Tracing the Funds: How Crypto Hot Wallets Were Targeted The report indicates that the alleged breach affected crypto hot wallets operated by BitoPro. Hot wallets, while convenient for facilitating quick transactions, are online and thus potentially more vulnerable to cyberattacks compared to cold storage solutions. The suspicious activity was observed across multiple blockchain networks, suggesting a coordinated effort by the attackers. Affected chains reportedly include: Tron Ethereum Solana Polygon Following the alleged extraction from the crypto hot wallets , the stolen assets were reportedly moved quickly through various channels in an apparent attempt to obscure their origin and ownership. This involved: Selling the assets through decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Depositing funds into Tornado Cash, a now-sanctioned crypto mixing service known for enabling privacy but also used for illicit activities. Bridging funds to Bitcoin (BTC) using THORChain, a decentralized cross-chain liquidity protocol. Transferring the final BTC amounts to Wasabi Wallet, a privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet. This complex trail highlights the methods attackers use to launder stolen digital assets and the challenges faced by investigators and exchanges in tracing them. Understanding the Implications of a Security Breach A security breach , whether confirmed or suspected, has wide-ranging implications for a crypto exchange and its users. For BitoPro, this could mean: Loss of User Trust: Security is paramount in crypto. An incident like this can severely erode user confidence, potentially leading to withdrawals and a decrease in trading volume. Reputational Damage: The exchange’s standing in the competitive crypto market could be negatively impacted. Regulatory Scrutiny: Security incidents often attract attention from financial regulators, potentially leading to investigations and stricter compliance requirements. Financial Costs: Beyond the lost assets, there are costs associated with investigation, potential reimbursement (if the exchange covers losses), and strengthening security infrastructure. For users, it’s a stark reminder of the risks associated with keeping significant amounts of funds on exchanges, especially in hot wallets. The Role of Blockchain Security and On-Chain Analysis While the incident points to a potential failure in the exchange’s internal security, the very nature of blockchain security allows for the transparency needed for analysts like ZachXBT to trace the flow of funds. Public ledgers on chains like Ethereum, Tron, Solana, and Polygon record every transaction, providing breadcrumbs for investigators. On-chain analysis tools and expertise are crucial in identifying suspicious patterns, linking addresses, and following the movement of stolen assets, even when obfuscation techniques like mixers or cross-chain bridges are used. This transparency, inherent to blockchain security , acts as a double-edged sword: it reveals the attack but also aids in tracking the perpetrators. What This Means for BitoPro and the Broader Crypto Landscape As of now, BitoPro has not officially commented on the situation. The crypto community awaits a formal statement to understand the full extent of the issue, whether it was indeed a breach, and what steps the exchange is taking to address it and protect user funds. This suspected incident serves as a critical reminder for all participants in the crypto space: For Exchanges: The constant need to audit and enhance security protocols, especially for crypto hot wallets , and to maintain transparency with users during potential incidents. For Users: The importance of practicing good security hygiene, such as enabling two-factor authentication, using strong passwords, and critically, minimizing the amount of crypto stored in exchange hot wallets, opting for cold storage for significant holdings. The resilience of the overall blockchain security ecosystem relies on continuous vigilance and improvement from all parties involved. Summary: The crypto world is watching closely as Taiwan’s BitoPro exchange faces scrutiny over a suspected security breach on May 8th, potentially resulting in an $11.5 million loss from crypto hot wallets across multiple blockchains. On-chain analysis by ZachXBT suggests stolen funds were laundered through DEXs, Tornado Cash, THORChain, and Wasabi Wallet. While BitoPro has not confirmed the incident, it underscores the persistent security challenges faced by crypto exchanges and the vital role of blockchain security and on-chain monitoring in tracking illicit activity. This event is a sharp reminder for both platforms and users about the necessity of prioritizing security in the volatile digital asset landscape.

2025-06-02T13:54:40,"Elon Musk Faces Backlash Over ‘Bitcoin-Style Encryption’ Claim in XChat Launch","Elon Musk’s latest announcement about a new encrypted messaging feature on X has ignited a firestorm, not for the feature itself, but for his baffling description of its underlying tech. On June 1, the X owner revealed via his official account on the social platform that the new XChat has been “built on Rust with (Bitcoin style) encryption.” Why Experts Say “Bitcoin-Style Encryption” is Nonsense Shortly after Musk’s post , a flood of commentary emerged, challenging the accuracy of his terminology. Notably, Bitcoin advocate Udi Wertheimer responded bluntly: “Bitcoin literally doesn’t have any encryption in it whatsoever.” The Taproot Wizards co-creator followed up by explaining that BTC uses cryptographic hashing and signing, which are essential for verifying data integrity and ownership, but do not conceal messages, a key function of encryption. “Encryption is when you have a message and want to keep it secret. Nothing in the Bitcoin protocol is encrypted… It’s all open, transparent, and viewable by anyone.” Adding to the chorus, cryptographer Ian Miers pointed out Bitcoin’s lack of privacy, likening it to a social media platform for bank accounts. “Everything you do is broadcast publicly,” he stated. “It’s the opposite of private.” The Zcash co-founder stressed that BTC transactions rely on signatures for authentication, rather than encryption for secrecy. He further critiqued the vagueness of Musk’s statement, writing: “Needless to say, ‘Bitcoin style’ and ‘Rust’ are not descriptions of an encryption scheme, nor are they strong indicators of security for a messaging app.” However, several other voices supported the Tesla CEO, with some guessing that he may have meant SHA-256 hashing. Computer engineer Wei Dai also offered a charitable interpretation , suggesting that Musk might have equated “Bitcoin-style” with “peer-to-peer” or “end-to-end” encryption. However, this theory failed to clarify what encryption protocols XChat actually uses, and such ambiguity only added fuel to the fire. Musk Under Scrutiny The ongoing debate comes amid broader concern surrounding Musk’s leadership. Just a month ago, Tesla was forced to issue a public denial following claims by the Wall Street Journal that the electric car manufacturer was in the market for a new CEO. This was supposedly due to investor unease over the 53-year-old’s controversial political engagements and erratic online behavior. The Tesla board responded, reaffirming its complete confidence in Musk’s leadership. This latest episode with XChat risks further undermining the outspoken billionaire’s credibility among technologists. As pseudonymous developer Yueya.eth aptly put it: “Marketing teams love throwing around crypto buzzwords without understanding basics.” And in an ecosystem where language and accuracy build trust, the Boring Company founder’s vague phrasing may cause more confusion than hype.

2025-06-02T13:53:09,"The Dark Times Are Here. Where Is Bitcoin?","Bitcoin emerged in the darkness of the global financial crisis in 2008. The Bitcoin white paper represented a genuine breakthrough in thinking about coordinating complex systems in a decentralized environment. Though not every idea in it was new, Bitcoin’s combination was ground-breaking in its scope and potential for reliability. The Bitcoin white paper was something else as well: a political statement about the inherent untrustworthiness of central banks, banking regulators and governments more generally. Satoshi Nakamoto expressed strong distrust of central banks in early emails introducing Bitcoin, and the Genesis Block itself contains a copy of a London Times headline from 2009, announcing that Britain’s Chancellor of the Exchequer was considering a second bank bailout. Bitcoin is supposed to be an alternative to the corrupt and corruptible governments, a bulwark against totalitarian states that removes their power to debase currency and seize assets from the population. Proof-of-Work, its consensus mechanism, is designed to prevent bad actors from corrupting the overall path of the network and self-custody means that no central authority can expropriate your assets. It was designed not just as a system of money, but a source of strength and independence in dark times. But, now the dark times are here, and Bitcoin is missing its moment. The U.S. dollar is the world’s leading safe-haven asset, and it is under attack . Huge deficits (6.7% of GDP) and a high debt ratio (121%) along with a deeply dysfunctional government should point to a lot of good reasons for bitcoin to soar. It’s mostly treading water (priced at $104,500 as we publish this). I can think of several reasons why. First, Bitcoin simply does not have the track record and staying power of other safe-haven assets. It is not that people are not seeking alternative safe havens; they are. The dollar is sinking against foreign currencies and gold, the oldest of all safe-haven assets, is hitting new highs. Fears about the regulatory position of bitcoin have eased, but access is still limited for many investors. Despite its recent history as a risk-on asset, in theory, bitcoin could be the very best asset in the world for de-risking a portfolio. Its issuance is fixed and the Proof of Work system, if no longer state-of-the-art, is still extremely well-proven. There will never be more than 21 million bitcoin and, no matter how high the price goes, it is not possible to create any more of it. Unlike gold and other precious metals, when prices increase, ever more challenging mining options become feasible, and more gold gets mined. So, is this game over for bitcoin? I think not. Though it would be nice if bitcoin were soaring, this moment may simply have come too soon for bitcoin to be the haven of choice. Fear not; this is certainly not the world’s last economic and political crisis. Between now and the next one, bitcoin has some work to do. Bitcoin has one assignment before the next upheaval hits: Prove it can still evolve. That means fixing the three doubts now blocking mainstream capital. First, make self‑custody idiot‑proof—hardware, recovery, and insurance. Serious investors do not want to go dumpster-diving to find their lost hard drives. Memories of past crises, including caps on insurance and “bail-ins” for wealthy investors, are a reminder that if they are “not your keys, they are not your coins.” Second, ship a quantum‑resilient signature scheme before quantum computers make private keys passé. Quantum computing’s future path is uncertain, but clever people are slowly but steadily making progress in this space. The risk to network security is real, even if the timeline is uncertain. The recent approval of NIST post-quantum signature schemes suggests that this reality is approaching. Third, reverse the miner‑consolidation trend with incentives that keep hash power distributed. Ethereum has done a great job working on resilience, distributing staking activity and building multiple client models. Bitcoin is lagging far behind in this space. We know hard pivots are possible. Five years ago, Ethereum’s fees were choking growth; one merge and a roll‑up boom later, it looks nimble and more decentralized than ever. Bitcoin does not need to imitate Ethereum, but it must borrow its urgency. If the community can tick those three boxes, the next flight‑to‑safety could finally land on bitcoin.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/06/02/the-dark-times-are-here-where-is-bitcoin,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|FIAT|MARKET","Opinion|Opinion",cryptocompare
2025-06-02T13:50:46,"BitoPro admits to $11.5M exploit after ZachXBT raised the alarm","Crypto investigator ZachXBT claimed on June 2 that Taiwan’s exchange BitoPro was likely hacked, resulting in a loss of nearly $11.5M. Hot wallets on Tron, Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon saw suspicious outflows on May 8, and the stolen assets were sold via DEX. The on-chain detective blew the whistle on Sunday, claiming that BitoPro was possibly hacked and the funds went into a coin mixer. According to ZachXBT, the loot was drained from hot wallets across multiple chains and laundered via Tornado Cash and Thorchain. Funds were then deposited into Tornado Cash or bridged Bitcoin via THORChain before they were deposited into Wasabi. The exchange has so far not officially acknowledged the incident, suspending its services only on the grounds of “system maintenance.” BitoPro acknowledges security breach weeks after incident 【BitoPro Official Statement: June 2, 2025】 BitoPro recently experienced a cyberattack on an old hot wallet during a wallet system upgrade. Upon detection, we quickly launched an emergency response, securing assets by moving them to new wallets and blocking the attacker. — BitoGroup 幣託集團 (@BitoEx_Official) June 2, 2025 BitoPro finally confirmed three weeks after the incident that it had suffered a wallet exploit. On June 2, the exchange said the breach occurred during a wallet system upgrade when an attacker exploited an “old hot wallet” during internal fund reallocation. On May 9, BitoPro announced a maintenance period for the exchange, which was resolved on the same day. Deposits, withdrawals, and all trading functions remained operational while a third-party blockchain security firm was commissioned to trace the stolen funds. However, many users have since reported being unable to withdraw USDt (USDT). “We hereby declare that the platform has sufficient virtual asset reserves and user rights are not affected at all. Since the incident, user top-up, withdrawal and transaction functions have remained normal.” – BitoPro BitoPro promised to release its new hot wallet address for external inspection soon in order to demonstrate its commitment to asset security and transparency. The exchange’s team added that many of the platform’s assets were stored in cold wallets with no external connections for a long time and had never been affected, so the overall assets were safe. The team also said it will continue to improve information security protection mechanisms, fine-tune wallet management processes and monitoring capabilities, and protect the asset security of every user. ZachXBT believes BitoPro’s delay in publicizing breach was unnecessarily Do you want to explain to the community why multiple of your hot wallets saw suspicious outflows of ~$11.5M on May 8, 2025 where you still have not disclosed the security incident on X or Telegram several weeks later? pic.twitter.com/HlD0c93Or4 — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) June 2, 2025 The crypto Sherlock Holmes also questioned BitoPro’s reluctance to publicize the hack and loss of funds on X or Telegram weeks (~25 days) after the alleged security incident. He recently demanded real consequences , especially for underage SIM swappers and phishers, pointing out that Canadian and EU laws were a bit lenient on such young malicious actors. However, SomaXBT, another scam survivor turned crypto-threats investigator, claimed that the BitoPro team was probably working in the background to recover the stolen funds to surprise their users with a great heist and recovery story. The exchange users shared ZachXBT’s claim on the official BitoPro Telegram channel, where an administrator of the channel responded by saying they had just received numerous inquiries and would respond accordingly after investigations were concluded. As of the time of publication, the extent to which user assets on the exchange were affected remains unclear, and the attackers have not yet been identified.

2025-06-02T13:50:24,"SHIB Price Prediction: $0.50 Not Likely, but Unilabs Could Turn $300 to $9,000","Shiba Inu, the biggest memecoin in Ethereum’s chain right now, dropped for four consecutive days and reached a low of $0.000012, which is its lowest level since April. The SHIB price has moved into a technical bear market, falling by almost 30% from its highest point in May. Shiba Inu’s decline is because of the ongoing crypto sell-off that has affected all types of coins. SHIB Price Crashes Amid Slow Burn Rate And Massive Offload Also, Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped from an all-time high of $111,900 last week to $103,000. The SHIB price has also crashed as its network faces substantial challenges. First, data shows that the Shiba Inu whales have been in a selling spree this year. Supply held by these investors started the year at 743 trillion and has now dropped to 723 trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB). Source: TradingView Shibarium (the layer-2 network) is also not doing well, as its total value locked is stuck at $2.92 million. In comparison, Uniswap (UNI) launched earlier this year with a TVL of over $600 million. Further, Shiba Inu’s token burn rate has lost momentum in the past few weeks. This week’s biggest burn was an 18 million transaction, directly affecting the SHIB price. Investing $300 in Unilabs Now Could Turn Into $9,000? While Shiba Inu (SHIB) struggles to hold ground in a shaky market, dropping nearly 30% from its May highs and facing slowed network growth, Unilabs (UNIL) is shaping up to be the AI-powered gem that could flip the narrative. Shiba Inu’s token burn rate is down, whales are exiting, and Shibarium is losing steam with under $3 million locked. Meanwhile, Unilabs boasts over $30 million in assets under management, introducing AI adoption in crypto with real-time data analysis and early-stage investment tracking. While the SHIB price hopes for $0.01 someday, Unilabs investors are already eyeing real value growth where a $300 investment could realistically surge past $9,000 as the ecosystem gains traction. Unilabs (UNIL) Takes the Lead Amid Memecoin Market Shakedown Among several dominating factors, what sets Unilabs (UNIL) apart is its AI-powered Launchpad, a robust infrastructure that basically never sleeps. It scans the crypto market for emerging projects daily, filtering hype from true potential. Instead of waiting for a coin to trend, Unilabs identifies high-growth tokens before they hit mainstream headlines. With tools like the Early Access Scoring System (EASS) and AI Market Pulse, Unilabs dominates projects like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, making data-backed investing easier, faster, and smarter. This isn’t just another DeFi asset manager, but an AI hedge fund for the everyday investor. Unilabs native token also offers a golden ticket opportunity to holders. This AI token is about exposure to elite-level projects, unlocking dividends, early access, governance power, and staking rewards. With each tier that holders move up, their share of the 30% platform fee redistribution grows. This unique advantage makes the UNIL token a must-have in 2025. Conclusion: As AI continues to lead the next crypto bull run, it won’t be a surprise if UNIL surges past $0.10 or even $0.25 in the next 12 to 18 months. While the current SHIB price and other memecoins are driven by community hype and speculative hope, Unilabs brings structure, data, and sustainable growth. And it’s not about luck, it’s about timing and tech. While the broader crypto ecosystem is leaning into AI, real-world assets, and institutional-grade DeFi, Unilabs platform fundamentals lead the charge and dominate other crypto giants.

But on-chain data tells a different story. Less than a day after his public exit, on-chain records noted that Wynn opened a fresh $100 million long on Bitcoin at $105,890.30, using 40x leverage.

Here’s what it all means. #JamesWynn #Hyperliquid #Bitcoin https://t.co/0zaR5Z0VyQ — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 28, 2025 On May 21, he opened a $830M long on BTC, later adding another $1.1B as BTC crossed $111K, bringing his unrealized profits to nearly $40M. The 40x leveraged position had a liquidation level of $107,975. Initially profitable, the trade soured after Bitcoin dropped following Trump’s tariff announcement. On May 25, Wynn attempted to hedge with an $856M BTC short, also 40x leveraged, but exited just 15 hours later with a $15.5M loss. His last profitable trade came on May 24, netting $18.4M as part of a risk management effort. Yet the same day, he closed a $1.25B long on Hyperliquid at a $13.4M loss , despite it having briefly shown $40M in paper gains. He also exited a 540 BTC sale for $1.5M profit during the same period. Wynn’s cumulative swings totaled $117.5M, with one of his largest exits occurring after BTC dipped to $107,431, just shy of his $104K liquidation price. He confirmed the exit on X, stating he had “cut his losses.” Prior to this, he had earned $25.19M from a PEPE long. The collapse marked the end of a dramatic journey from $4M to a $100M portfolio peak. In a reflective X thread, Wynn called his final hours “surreal,” admitting he posted cryptic warnings as prices neared liquidation. I've decided to give perp trading a break.

It was literal—bleeding by the second.” Despite vowing to step back, blockchain data from Hypurrscan confirmed that hours later, Wynn re-entered with a new $100M BTC long, again on Hyperliquid, again at 40x leverage, with an entry at $105,890.30. As of the latest update, the position is down $1.7 million, and Wynn appears to be adding to it to avoid liquidation.

2025-06-02T13:35:33,"Is Musk’s New XChat Bitcoin Encryption Too Good to Be True?","Musk's XChat Promises Bitcoin-Style Encryption — Is It Credible? Elon Musk is at it again in the virtual world—this time by promising to roll out ”Bitcoin-style” end-to-end encryption onto XChat, the revamped direct messaging service on X (formerly Twitter). The announcement, delivered in true Musk fashion via a tweet, has excited some and left most of the industry insiders and observers in the tech and cryptocurrency worlds unconvinced. XChat, which is written completely in the Rust programming language, is shipping with a raft of privacy-focused features: end-to-end encrypted messaging, disappearing messages, any-file-type support, and cross-platform video and audio calls — all without users needing a phone number. Musk says XChat's encryption is built on the same robust cryptographic foundations that protect Bitcoin, but what does that actually mean? Cracking ”Bitcoin-Style” Encryption Bitcoin's own security relies upon elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), specifically the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), which allows users to generate public/private key pairs and securely sign messages. In discussing messaging, ”Bitcoin-style” cryptography likely means that XChat would utilize similar ECC-based techniques — i.e., Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) for secure key exchange and ECIES for message encryption. This can provide strong, efficient end-to-end security, with only the sender and recipient capable of reading the messages. However, as some cryptography experts have pointed out, Bitcoin itself does not encrypt transactions, but rather signs them, so that the ”Bitcoin-style encryption” label is more of a marketing phrase than an engineering term. Security researcher Ian Miers further contributed, ”Bitcoin primarily uses signatures, not encryption. It's like saying, we decided to drive our rocket on water, as NASA uses Hydrogen and Oxygen”. Others comment that Rust is a secure, new language, but it's not exactly a guarantee of cryptographic correctness. Security Experts: Divergent Perspectives and Outstanding Issues The cryptosphere and security communities disagree. Some privacy champions welcome XChat's move as a step long overdue toward the mainstream embrace of strong encryption, potentially signing up millions for public-key cryptography and secure digital communication as the new standard. Others caution that in the absence of open-source code and third-party audit, individuals are putting their trust in Musk's guarantee—a risky bet in the wake of the platform's recent history of data breaches. “Needless to say ‘Bitcoin style’ and ‘Rust’ are not descriptions of an encryption scheme, nor are they strong indicators of security for a messaging app.” — Ian Miers, cryptography professor, on X “XChat’s ECC-based protocols could set a new standard for privacy, but only if they’re transparent and auditable.” — @PrivacyMatters, June 2, 2025 Mainstream Effect: Crypto Onboarding or Confusion? If XChat's security stands up to examination, it is a privacy game-changer for mass market messaging. The disappearing messages, file sharing, and phone number-less accounts place XChat on a head-to-head collision course with WhatsApp, Signal, and Telegram, but with the added twist of crypto-motivated security. Some believe this could demystify public-key cryptography for millions, paving the way for more mass-market use of crypto. Yet, the lack of technical clarity and the closed nature of X’s stack have left many experts cautious. Without open protocols or code audits, it’s impossible to know if XChat’s encryption is as “Bitcoin-grade” as Musk claims — or if it’s simply marketing spin Whether XChat's encryption is genuine privacy innovation or just good marketing, one thing is certain: the battle for secure messaging—and crypto's place in mainstream tech — is only just starting.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9399/is-musk-s-new-x-chat-bitcoin-encryption-too-good-to-be-true,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","News|Security",cryptocompare
