2025-06-02T07:49:58,"Bitcoin Price Prediction for June 2025: Here’s What to Expect From the BTC Price","The post Bitcoin Price Prediction for June 2025: Here’s What to Expect From the BTC Price appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin price remained consolidated below $106,000 throughout the weekend, suggesting the sellers maintained their dominance. As the weekly divergence has been locked in, a potential bearish retest seems to be forming finely. Despite the price trying to overcome the bearish pullback, the BTC price failed to secure a crucial range, which keeps the bearish hopes alive. Hence, the upcoming price action in June could witness a roller coaster ride in either direction, but the question is whether the token will be able to reclaim $110K. Investors Remain Sceptical on the Next Price Action The Bitcoin bulls have been holding the rally above an important support level at $102,153 ever since the price surged above the range in May. The recent bounce also substantiates the bullish claim to some extent, but the traders seem to be more interested in the current price range between $103,000 and $107,000, as they have been placing huge bets within the range. This suggests the traders are preparing for both scenarios, and as a result, liquidity is piling up on either side. The data from Coinglass suggests the short liquidation after the price rose above $105,500, while the longs have remained untouched at around $103,500. Hence, there are more possibilities of the price testing the price range, which could offer a significant bullish push towards the higher range, which is limited to $106,200. However, a rise above this range could require huge liquidity; meanwhile, the volume has dropped since the start of the month, but the bulls have maintained some dominance. Will BTC Price Mark a New ATH in June 2025 Considering the recent price action, it is quite obvious that the BTC price is expected to consolidate along the local highs for a while. However, the price action that could follow may certainly not be in favour of the bulls. If the price follows the historical price action, the star crypto is feared to undergo a steep correction soon. A popular analyst, anonymously known as AlphaBTC , shares the similarities in the recent price action of Bitcoin, which raises the possibility of a pullback to $90,000 or slightly below. However, the analyst is quite sure of the bullish reversal, which may lead the Bitcoin price to new highs, probably to $125,000. But before this, a correction appears imminent as the indicators like RSI, MACD, CMF, and DMI are about to undergo a bearish reversal. Regardless of the horizontal consolidation, El Salvador, Metaplanet, BlackRock, and Strategy continue to stack Bitcoin. Moreover, some are raising funds to buy more Bitcoin, which should be considered a huge bullish signal, as the real bull run is yet to begin.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-price-prediction-for-june-2025-heres-what-to-expect-from-the-btc-price/,"BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 In May 2025, Bitcoin witnessed an unstoppable and steady ascent. This recovery was fueled by easing tensions from the trade tariff war, pushing BTC to a new all-time high of $112K. However, by the final week of May, the price dipped to $103,500 — a key support area that had formed during the month. Now, in the early days of June, Bitcoin is attempting to hold this support level after pulling back from its all-time high. Yet, it continues to face resistance from the 20-day EMA band. If bearish pressure increases again, this support zone becomes crucial. A breakdown below it could lead to a further decline toward the $100K to $95K range in the short term. Additionally, market sentiment has shifted from optimism to pessimism over the past 24 hours. The BTC long/short ratio has dropped from 1.0141 to 0.9399, signaling a weakening bullish grip. This indicates that bullish momentum has stalled, and bears are no longer on the sidelines—they are actively pushing the price lower. On the flip side, if bearish pressure fades and sentiment improves, Bitcoin would need to break past its newly formed all-time high to resume upward momentum. If this happens, BTC will enter price discovery mode, targeting a near-term level of $120,000, with the potential for even higher gains in the months ahead. On-chain data shows that a significant amount of dormant Bitcoin, unmoved for 1 to 2 years, has recently become active. This type of movement is often viewed as a bearish signal, indicating that short-term holders (those holding for less than two years) may be preparing to sell. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 A key factor driving the potential for higher Bitcoin prices is the relationship with global liquidity. Historical trends reveal that as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences dramatic price surges. Now, with global liquidity beginning to rise again after a prolonged period of stagnation, the stage seems set for another major rally in Bitcoin’s value. This shift in liquidity could create the perfect environment for Bitcoin to soar once more. Also, cryptoquant data suggest that accumulation is on top with exchange reserve declining at more alarming rates. When writing 2.4 Milliion BTC were in total on the exchange reserves, which is a strong decline from a year ago when reserves were 3.1 Million BTC.

(@Metaplanet_JP) June 2, 2025 The recent addition to the treasury arrived just days after Metaplanet arranged another $21M bond funding round with the goal of new acquisitions. The acquisitions added to last week’s BTC hype, but failed to keep the current price above $105,000. BTC still traded at $104,850 in the new week, expecting more news of corporate buying. As usual, the recent BTC purchase announcement had an effect on the Metaplanet market price. Recently, Metaplanet drew enough attention to become the go-to stock for indirect exposure to BTC for Japanese investors. The company aims for the effect of Strategy (MSTR) for the Japanese market. After the announcement, the Metaplanet market price rose to 1,142 JPY ($7.97), close to the recent monthly peak at 1,222 JPY. The shares recently became Japan’s most volatile stock, as interest shifted rapidly for the company during its latest series of BTC purchases. The stock effect repeats the behavior of other BTC treasury companies, which often gain in the short term following acquisition announcements. The effect has spread to public mining companies , which retained some of their net gains in the past month. Metaplanet has been one of the most regular buyers, among a trend to accumulate BTC in corporate treasuries. The latest reported purchases increased the total amount of stored BTC to 3.38M coins. A total of 116 public companies already hold treasuries, with accelerated additions in May. Metaplanet gains general attention Metaplanet is breaking the containment of Japanese investments. In the past few days, the company has increased its search volumes, originating from other developed crypto markets. Searches for ‘Metaplanet Inc.’ are up 300%, originating from the USA, Canada, and top crypto markets in the Euro area. Metaplanet is also getting close to building a $1B treasury, within a small price hike or another acquisition.

2025-06-02T07:25:54,"Liquidity Surge To Ignite the Next Crypto Bull Run","Global liquidity is quietly climbing again, and that could change everything for crypto markets. According to experts Michael Howell and Raoul Pal, this shift could trigger the next major bull run in digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Michael Howell, a global liquidity analyst, sees signs of a structural liquidity wave forming. This trend is fueled by the U.S. Treasury’s drawdown of its cash reserves and China’s aggressive monetary easing , which includes yuan devaluation—especially against gold. Howell argues this isn’t just a temporary boost but a long-term shift supported by growing fiscal pressures and rising debt levels. Raoul Pal agrees, but zooms in on crypto. He believes crypto assets are highly sensitive to liquidity changes, acting as ""high beta"" investments that react strongly to money flowing into global markets. Pal predicts we are entering the so-called “banana zone,” a period of exponential crypto gains sparked by liquidity, shifting narratives, and returning retail investors. His models suggest crypto market cap could more than triple by 2026, potentially surpassing $10 trillion. Still, both experts warn that this bull case depends on liquidity continuing to grow. If inflation returns or the U.S. Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy too quickly, it could stall the momentum. Volatility is also expected to remain high. For now, the signs are aligning.

2025-06-02T07:20:28,"Urgent Halt Demanded: NAACP Challenges xAI Data Center Operations in Memphis Over Pollution","BitcoinWorld Urgent Halt Demanded: NAACP Challenges xAI Data Center Operations in Memphis Over Pollution In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, the infrastructure powering these advancements is often overlooked. While the focus is typically on groundbreaking algorithms or new crypto applications leveraging AI, the physical footprint and energy demands of the necessary computing power are significant. This brings us to a developing situation in Memphis, Tennessee, where a major civil rights organization is raising serious alarms about one such facility: Elon Musk’s xAI data center. NAACP xAI Conflict Escalates Over ‘Dirty Data Center’ The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has directly challenged local officials in Memphis, urging them to stop operations at Colossus, the large-scale computing facility run by Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI. The conflict centers on environmental concerns surrounding the facility’s power generation. According to reports, NAACP leaders sent a letter to the Shelby County Health Department and Memphis Light Gas and Water (MLGW), criticizing what they described as a “lackadaisical approach” to overseeing the operation of this facility, which they labeled a “dirty data center.” The civil rights group’s demand is stark: issue an emergency order for xAI to cease operations completely. Failing that, they call for authorities to at least cite the company and prevent alleged violations of clean air regulations. Focus on the xAI Data Center and Its Power Needs The facility in question, known as Colossus, is described as a “supercomputer.” Building and operating an AI supercomputer requires immense electrical power, not just to run the processors but also for the extensive cooling systems needed to prevent overheating. While connecting to the local grid is standard, some large facilities, particularly those needing significant or highly reliable power, may supplement or primarily rely on on-site power generation, often using gas turbines. The NAACP’s concerns specifically target the gas turbines xAI is using at the Colossus site. The company has reportedly applied for a permit to operate 15 such turbines. However, the NAACP’s letter alleges that authorities have permitted xAI to operate at least 35 gas turbines without any necessary permitting over the past year. City officials have previously stated that permits were not required for the turbines’ initial year of operation, a point of contention for the NAACP. Environmental Pollution and Health Risks The core of the NAACP’s complaint revolves around the potential for environmental pollution emanating from these gas turbines. Such turbines can emit various hazardous air pollutants. The NAACP’s letter highlighted specific concerns: Emissions reportedly include formaldehyde at levels potentially exceeding EPA limits. Concerns were also raised about nitrogen-oxide emissions. These pollutants are known to have adverse health effects. The NAACP’s letter connects these emissions directly to existing health vulnerabilities in the community near the facility. The Memphis Data Center Location and Environmental Justice The location of the Memphis data center is a critical factor in the NAACP’s advocacy. The Colossus facility is situated near the Boxtown neighborhood in South Memphis. The NAACP described Boxtown as a “historically Black community.” This geographical context frames the issue as one of environmental justice. The NAACP argues that placing polluting industries near communities that are already vulnerable or historically marginalized perpetuates a trend where those who contribute least to environmental problems bear the brunt of the pollution’s impact. Their letter starkly points out that the area already faces significant health challenges, noting that cancer risks are reportedly four times the national average. They argue that instead of working to reduce these existing health issues, the Shelby County Health Department has allegedly allowed xAI to operate in a manner that could exacerbate them. What Happens Next? The NAACP’s letter puts pressure on local authorities, specifically the Shelby County Health Department and MLGW commissioners. The response from these entities will determine the immediate future of the xAI facility’s operations and potentially set precedents for how large, power-hungry AI infrastructure projects are regulated in the future. As of recent reports, a spokesperson for Memphis Light Gas and Water indicated they had not yet received the NAACP’s letter. Bitcoin World has reportedly reached out to both the NAACP and xAI for comment on the situation. The outcome of this conflict could have implications not only for xAI and the Memphis community but also for the broader conversation around the environmental footprint of artificial intelligence development and the siting of the massive data centers required to power the next generation of AI and potentially, the infrastructure supporting crypto technologies. Summary: A Growing Concern for AI Infrastructure The dispute between the NAACP and xAI over the Memphis data center highlights a growing area of concern: the environmental impact of the physical infrastructure needed for advanced AI computing. The allegations of operating numerous gas turbines without permits and potentially exceeding pollution limits raise serious questions about regulatory oversight and corporate responsibility. For the nearby Boxtown community, this is not just a technical issue but one with direct implications for public health and environmental equity. The NAACP’s call for an immediate halt underscores the urgency with which they view the potential risks posed by the facility’s current operations.

The exploit involved unauthorized access to BitoPro's hot wallets across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum, Tron, Solana, and Polygon.

2025-06-02T07:04:50,"Trump’s Trade War Now Closer to Endgame As White House Loses Court Cases, According to Fundstrat’s Tom Lee","The chief investment officer of investment firm Fundstrat says that President Donald Trump’s trade war is nearing its end as courts rule against the White House. In a new video update on the Fundstrat Capital YouTube channel, Tom Lee says that court rulings against Trump’s tariffs suggest that the White House is losing leverage. “In our view, the tariff war and concerns have a bark worse than the bite. Let me explain, for instance… on May 28th, the international trade court ruled against the Trump tariffs. Now it didn’t remove all of them, but it ruled against them and on Thursday, May 29th, the DC District Court Judge Contreras ruled that [the] tariffs are illegal. So it’s two cases ruling against White House tariffs, but on the same day, the Federal Court of Appeals issued an administrative stay which reinstates the tariffs – at least through June 9th – but you can see this is getting quite complicated and the White House is insisting nothing has changed after the tariff rulings. And in fact, Goldman Sachs highlights that there’s many measures the White House can take to implement or re-implement tariffs. But ultimately, the White House is losing leverage, and it’s taking us closer to the endgame.” Lee also says that due to the rulings, Trump will struggle to revamp the trade war, and that the White House will be looking for an exit strategy on the matter soon. Lee goes on to note that tariff visibility and other factors have led to a better investment outlook for stocks now compared to earlier this year. “The investment outlook is better for stocks now arguably than it was in February 2025 because you’ve got tariff visibility, you have tax and deregulation visibility, [and] the companies survived [a] fifth major stress test… and the Fed is arguably more dovish next year.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-02T07:03:06,"Experienced Analyst Shares New Weekly Forecasts for Bitcoin (BTC) Price","Axel Adler Jr., an analyst at cryptocurrency analysis platform CryptoQuant, noted that despite Bitcoin’s recent brief pullback to $103,000-$104,000, fundamental indicators remain strong. According to Adler, Bitcoin reserves on exchanges continue to decline, institutional buying continues to put pressure on supply, and long-term investors are increasing their purchases, building a “buffer support” under the market. On the macroeconomic front, mixed signals prevail. While the slowdown in Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation in the US has eased policy pressure on the Fed to some extent, rising bond yields and uncertain tariffs have strengthened the “risk aversion” sentiment in the markets and suppressed growth appetite. Related News: Significant Cryptocurrency Bill Unveiled in South Korea - Expected to Pass Easily Adler stated that the basic scenario for the coming week is for Bitcoin to trend sideways between $103,000 and $110,000. However, if there is a 20% breakout due to momentum and an increase in trading volume and the $110,000 level is exceeded, he added that a strong signal could be formed that the market is ready to test the $115,000-$120,000 band. On the other hand, if net inflows turn negative and prices fall below $100,000, it could be a sign of a deeper correction. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-02T07:00:33,"Bitcoin Price Risks Break Down To $92,000 As It Enters Accumulation Phase","The Bitcoin price has turned bearish after hitting a new all-time high above $111,000 back in May. This turn in the tide was expected as the rally put Bitcoin holders in massive profit, showing a risk of profit-taking that could tank the price. So far, the price is already down by 6% % from its all-time high and trending at $104,000 at the time of this writing. But as bears take control, it is likely that the decline is far from over, and the cryptocurrency could fall below 6-figures again. The Pathology Of The Bitcoin All-Time High A pseudonymous analyst who goes by Youriverse on the TradingView website has explained the movement of the Bitcoin price over the past few weeks and why the market has been moving the way it has. As he explains, Bitcoin has been exhibiting what is known as a textbook accumulation since the uptrend began in the second week of May. This accumulation was part of the reason why the cryptocurrency rallied to new all-time highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Still Bullish, But $200,000 Off The Table And $137,000 In Sight At this time, the crypto analyst revealed that the Bitcoin price had seen more compression as it reached higher lows and resistance remained relatively flat. Additionally, the selling pressure that had rocked the Bitcoin price through the last few months due to the Donald Trump tariff wars had also waned at this time, putting the buyers in control of the price. The result of this is a possible ‘Power of 3’, which the analyst explains includes Accumulation, Manipulation, and Distribution. These three together were part of the reason that the Bitcoin price started moving upward. The resultant rally saw an initial push toward previous all-time high levels, and then subsequently, there was a push to a new all-time high above $111,000. However, the price action waned before Bitcoin could break $112,000. As a result of the dwindling upward pressure, a reversal was inevitable, and the Bitcoin price suffered a decline toward previous support levels at $106,000. However, this support has not held as it has since broken below this level, signaling “a notable shift in market structure.” Why A Decline To $92,000 Is Possible The analyst explained that the ‘Power of 3’ could be playing out right now, and this could see the price go further downward as larger investors dump on the lesser informed retail crowd. Furthermore, as the Bitcoin price continues to trend below the $106,000 support for longer, it increases the likelihood that the price could fall further. “The rejection above the ATH and the subsequent breakdown below $106K has introduced significant overhead supply, which may act as resistance in the near term,” the analyst said. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Price Still Rally 1,000%? Analyst Reveals End-Of-Year Prediction Given this, he expects that the Bitcoin price could end up falling back to $100,000 and even reach as low as the mid-$90,000s. But if this happens, rather than triggering a bearish trend, it could mean an opportunity to buy, as this area could attract more liquidity and serve as a bounce-off point for another rally. “This potential pullback should not be viewed solely as a sign of weakness,” the analyst stated. “In many bull cycles, such corrections and shakeouts serve to flush out over-leveraged positions and reset sentiment, ultimately laying the groundwork for renewed upward momentum.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-break-down/,"BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT",cryptocompare

According to blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain , Ulbricht received 300 BTC, worth about $31.4 million, to his donation wallet early on Sunday. Arkham data suggests that most of the coins were eventually sent to crypto exchange Kraken within a few hours of receiving the donation. Ulbricht, who was released from prison earlier this year on a pardon from President Trump, made a speech at the Bitcoin 2025 conference over the weekend, which was his first appearance in public since being freed. Coinbase director Conor Grogan says Bitcoin wallets left behind by Ross Ulbricht when he was imprisoned for his role in Silk Road are still holding tens of millions of dollars worth of BTC. The US government seized tens of thousands of Bitcoin tied to Silk Road, but Grogan says they weren’t able to get their hands on 100% of the coins. “I found ~430 BTC across dozens of wallets associated with Ross Ulbricht that were not confiscated by the US government and have been untouched for 13-plus years Back then, these were probably dust wallets, now, collectively, they are worth about $47 million.

On-chain data suggests the market may be entering overheated territory soon. Analysts expect either sideways movement or a mild price correction. Bitcoin made headlines in May after breaking its earlier all-time high. On May 21, 2025, it jumped to $110,797, beating its previous record of $109,588 set in January. The very next day, it climbed even higher to $111,980, almost touching $112,000. This move comes after a slow first quarter for the market. Back in early April, Bitcoin was trading around $74,500 during rising US-China trade tensions. Since then, its price has steadily climbed, making a strong recovery. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at$104,820. While Bitcoin has gained over 50% in six weeks, major altcoins Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) haven’t managed to keep up. Even with a 97% bounce from April’s lows, they remain far below their past highs. This has pushed Bitcoin dominance higher, reaching 65% in May 2025, a level last seen in 2021.

2025-06-02T06:38:42,"Il prezzo di Dogecoin rischia il tracollo se non regge questo livello chiave","Il prezzo di Dogecoin (DOGE) è tra quelli che hanno subito i colpi più duri durante le recenti flessioni del mercato, nonostante Bitcoin (BTC) sia ancora vicino ai suoi massimi storici. Al momento, DOGE è già sceso sotto il supporto dei 0,20 $ , un segnale chiaro che i ribassisti sono tornati a dettare le regole. La situazione si fa delicata: la celebre “meme coin” si trova ora su un filo del rasoio. C’è un livello di supporto cruciale all’orizzonte – se non riesce a reggerlo, il rischio di un tonfo pesante è molto concreto. Leggi anche : Migliori Meme Coin – Guida ai Meme Token più Promettenti del 2025 Dogecoin resta in fase rialzista, ma deve difendere trendline e supporti chiave Secondo l’analista crypto Lingrid , il prezzo di Dogecoin si trova in una zona critica, con alcuni livelli che potrebbero fare davvero la differenza per il futuro della meme coin. Al momento il ritracciamento sembra seguire uno schema classico chiamato “ABC”, tipico dei movimenti correttivi nei mercati. Tuttavia, questo movimento ribassista sembra stia perdendo forza. Nonostante ciò, i ribassisti sono riusciti a riportare il prezzo sotto quota 0,20 $ , mettendo pressione sulla tenuta della struttura rialzista. Secondo l’analista Lingrid, nonostante il recente calo, il prezzo di Dogecoin mantiene ancora una struttura rialzista. Questo perché la crypto ha segnato un “minimo crescente” – un segnale positivo – proprio in corrispondenza del supporto del canale ascendente. Lingrid sottolinea l’importanza della zona tra 0,188 e 0,190 $ : finché Dogecoin riesce a restare sopra quest’area, il trend positivo resta intatto. In più, la struttura tecnica rimane solida: il prezzo si trova ancora sopra sia la trendline che il blocco di supporto, due elementi fondamentali per chi guarda al medio-lungo termine. Adesso la vera sfida è tutta nelle mani dei compratori: se vogliono mantenere viva la fase rialzista, devono riprendere il controllo rispetto ai venditori. Secondo l’analisi, si sono aperte delle zone di acquisto interessanti tra 0,187 e 0,19 $ , con il prezzo di Dogecoin che si trova proprio in mezzo a quest’area cruciale. Per confermare un vero rilancio, i tori (i compratori) dovrebbero riuscire a riportare il prezzo sopra quota 0,195 $ con una conferma rialzista: da lì, l’obiettivo sarebbe puntare dritti verso 0,215 $ . Ma non è tutto rose e fiori. Se Dogecoin dovesse scendere sotto il minimo crescente , cioè sotto i 0,187 $ , per l’analista si tratterebbe di un chiaro segnale di vendita . Inoltre, se il prezzo continua a rimanere sotto i 0,195 $ senza riuscire a rompere al rialzo, la fase di consolidamento potrebbe rallentare ulteriormente il breakout. Occhio anche a Bitcoin: un calo del prezzo di BTC potrebbe indebolire tutto lo scenario positivo costruito finora per Dogecoin. Potrebbe interessarti anche : Comprare Bitcoin anonimamente e senza documenti Dogecoin continua a mostrare una forte zona di supporto Anche l’analista crypto Stanley Crypto conferma che Dogecoin sta trovando un buon livello di supporto, nonostante l’andamento piatto delle ultime ore. Proprio come evidenziato da Lingrid, Stanley sottolinea l’importanza dell’area tra 0,18 e 0,19 $ , definendola la zona di supporto più solida al momento. È qui che si sta giocando la partita: il prezzo sembra essersi stabilizzato, e molti investitori stanno osservando attentamente se questa base riuscirà a reggere. Questo significa che i compratori (i “bulls”) devono assolutamente difendere questo livello di supporto se vogliono che il trend rialzista abbia una possibilità di continuare. Come conclude Stanley: “La configurazione attuale suggerisce un potenziale trend al rialzo, con massimi via via più alti. Ma se il prezzo rompe al ribasso sotto il supporto, tutto potrebbe saltare.”",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/il-prezzo-di-dogecoin-rischia-il-tracollo-se-non-regge-questo-livello-chiave/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Uncategorized",cryptocompare

Sell-offs have picked up, and weak market momentum is shaking confidence. As SHIB fades, whales are shifting to new plays. Unilabs is catching that wave. On-chain data shows over $500,000 of its $1.7 million presale came from SHIB holders. That’s a clear signal: seasoned investors want more than hype. Unilabs delivers real utility and passive income, something Shiba Inu coin can’t offer. It’s becoming the smarter choice for those seeking stronger, long-term gains. SHIB’s Price Faces Major Resistance as Whales Go On Selling Spree SHIB’s price keeps sliding, dropping for four days straight and hitting $0.00001238 – its lowest since April 22. That’s a 30% drop from its May high, pushing Shiba Inu coin into a bear market. Bitcoin’s fall from $111,900 to $103,000 hasn’t helped, dragging down overall sentiment. Whales are also pulling back. Large wallets have cut holdings from 743 trillion to 723 trillion Shiba Inu coin since January. This steady sell-off shows falling confidence and adds pressure on SHIB’s price. Source | TradingView Shibarium, the Shiba Inu coin’s layer-2 network, is also underperforming. It holds just $2.92 million in total value, far behind rivals like Unichain with over $600 million. Weak adoption raises doubts about the memecoin’s long-term use, impacting SHIB’s price. The burn rate is fading, too. The biggest burn this week hit just 18 million Shiba Inu coins – a far cry from past billion-token events. With burns slowing, one of the key bullish drivers for SHIB’s price is losing strength. Technicals offer no relief. SHIB’s price broke below its wedge pattern and the 50-day moving average. If buyers don’t step in soon, analysts see a drop to $0.00001033 as likely. Right now, the trend remains bearish for Shiba Inu coin. How is Unilabs Reshaping the Asset Management Industry? Unilabs is changing how asset management works. It fixes a big problem even top firms like Vanguard and BlackRock face – human error. These mistakes cost billions. Unilabs uses AI to cut that risk and make smarter, faster decisions.

Conservative investors aren’t left out. The Stablecoin Savings Account lets them earn steady returns through secure stablecoin pools. It’s a simple way to grow crypto holdings without taking on major risk. Over 20k Investors Back Unilabs Unilabs’ token, UNIL, is quickly grabbing attention. Priced at $0.0051, it has already raised over $1.7 million – a big win for a project just weeks old. But there’s more to the buzz than fast money. Some investors are chasing quick gains, expecting a move to $0.0061 soon. Others see the real value in holding for the long term. Unilabs offers more than hype – it pays back. Its model sends 30% of revenue to UNIL holders as dividends, giving users passive income just for holding the token. This approach encourages loyalty and adds steady demand. Investors don’t just hope for price jumps – they earn while they wait. It’s a stock-style model that’s rare in crypto and built for serious returns. Unilabs mixes short-term potential with real utility. That combo is drawing in both traders and long-term backers.

Grayscale’s GBTC and Bitwise’s BITB also took a hit, losing $134.4 million and $104.3 million, respectively. Other funds like Invesco’s BTCO, Franklin Templeton’s EZBC, and VanEck’s HODL recorded a combined $30.3 million in redemptions. Still, it wasn’t entirely bearish across the board. BlackRock’s IBIT managed to offset a significant portion of the outflows with $584.6 million in inflows, indicating that some investors still viewed the pullback as a buying opportunity. Grayscale’s mini BTC fund and Valkyrie’s BRRR also saw modest inflows, helping soften the overall blow. Despite last week’s redemptions, May still ended on a bullish note for Bitcoin ETFs overall. Net inflows totaled around $5.23 billion for the month, up over 75% compared to April’s figure. For context, February and March had seen net outflows of $3.56 billion and $767.91 million, respectively. The rebound in May shows just how much appetite investors still have for BTC, even with short-term market jitters. You might also like: Bitcoin exchange reserves hit an all-time low — is a volatility spike coming? Investor demand for Bitcoin ETFs took a hit last week, partly because traders started locking in profits after BTC’s rally its new all-time high earlier in May. With June historically being a bearish month for Bitcoin in four of the past six years, many likely chose to take some gains off the table ahead of a potential seasonal dip. At the same time, fresh worries on the macro front didn’t help. The ongoing drama around Trump’s trade tariffs resurfaced after two U.S. courts issued conflicting rulings. One ruling declared the tariffs illegal , while the other allowed them to stay in place during the appeal process, which could drag on all the way to the Supreme Court. That kind of uncertainty is keeping some investors on edge. Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has slipped about 4.3% over the past week, briefly dipping to $103,950 on June 2 before bouncing back a bit to around $105,000. Even with the drop, BTC is still just 6.1% off its all-time high of $111,814 from earlier last month. “This pullback is healthy, not signaling outright bearishness but more of a pause and consolidation,” Himanshu Maradiya, founder and chairman of CIFDAQ, told crypto.news. “Overall, this is not a risk-on environment, but also not one to fear. It’s a time for discipline: capital preservation, sharp focus, and readiness to seize opportunities as they arise.” Read more: Top 4 reasons why XRP price may surge 50% in June",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/bitcoin-etfs-ended-six-week-inflow-streak-over-macro-jitters-and-btc-slump/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","News|BlackRock|Cryptocurrency|DeFi",cryptocompare
2025-06-02T06:33:41,"Bitcoin stays over $105K; ‘overheating’ concerns emerge, Hayes forecasts major surge","Bitcoin (BTC) maintained its position above the $105,000 mark as the Asian business week commenced, demonstrating relative stability over the weekend with minimal price movement and compressed trading volumes. While the broader market sentiment remains bullish, a new report from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant suggests certain metrics are indicating the Bitcoin market might be “overheating,” potentially signaling a near-term consolidation phase. The world’s largest digital asset exhibited a calm weekend, with price fluctuations limited to around 0.4%. However, beneath this surface stability, CryptoQuant’s analysis points to some underlying pressures. The report reveals that Bitcoin demand has surged significantly, reaching 229,000 BTC over the past 30 days. This figure is rapidly approaching the December 2024 peak demand of 279,000 BTC. Concurrently, balances held by “whales” – large Bitcoin holders – have increased by 2.8 percent. Historically, such a pace of accumulation by whales can often signal a slowing down of their buying activity, potentially preceding a market cool-off. These indicators, taken together, suggest that the current rally, which recently propelled Bitcoin prices to a record high of $112,000, may be approaching a short-term peak. The CryptoQuant report identifies $120,000 as the next major resistance level for Bitcoin. This level is tied to the upper band of the Traders’ On-chain Realized Price, a metric indicating a point where unrealized profits for traders would hit 40 percent – a threshold that has historically coincided with local market tops. Despite these cautionary signals, CryptoQuant’s “Bull Score Index” remains robust at 80, indicating continued underlying bullish momentum. Nevertheless, the combination of rising profit margins for existing holders and peaking demand growth suggests that traders might face a period of price consolidation before Bitcoin can embark on its next significant upward move. Arthur Hayes’ audacious prediction: $250K Bitcoin by year-end? Adding a highly bullish counterpoint to the near-term caution, Bitcoin billionaire and BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has forecasted a dramatic surge in Bitcoin’s price. Hayes predicts that Bitcoin will more than double within the next six months, potentially reaching an astonishing $250,000. He attributes this optimistic outlook to an anticipated shift in US President Donald Trump’s fiscal policies, moving away from market-rattling tariffs towards more stimulative measures. “Midterm elections are coming up in the US,” Hayes told Decrypt during an interview at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. While the Trump administration went hard on tariffs and was taking this market pain for the last three months, that narrative has to shift. Hayes, known for his bold market predictions, argued that instead of pursuing trade policies that could dampen economic growth and potentially impact American consumers’ affordability, the president will need to demonstrate that he has “brought goodies for the population.” This, Hayes believes, will be crucial to bolstering Republican prospects at the ballot box in the 2026 midterm elections. The mechanism for this, according to Hayes, will involve a more accommodative monetary stance. “They’re going to accelerate the money printing,” Hayes stated, referring to the Federal Reserve – the independent US government agency primarily responsible for managing the nation’s money supply. Such a scenario, involving increased liquidity, is often seen by crypto proponents as highly bullish for assets like Bitcoin, which are perceived as hedges against currency debasement.

2025-06-02T06:21:20,"France brings charges against 25 in crypto kidnapping conspiracy","French prosecutors have formally charged 25 people, some as young as 16, in connection with a series of attempted kidnappings targeting crypto industry figures and their families. According to local media, the charges follow a string of high-profile abduction plots that have shaken France’s growing digital asset community. The suspects, aged between 16 and 23, are believed to be linked to coordinated efforts to kidnap individuals with ties to cryptocurrency wealth, often using stolen vehicles and fake courier branding to carry out the attacks. Central to the latest indictments is the widely reported May 13 kidnapping attempt in Paris, where masked assailants attacked the daughter and grandson of Paymium CEO Pierre Noizat. The attack took place in the 11th arrondissement in broad daylight and was caught on video, which later circulated online. All three victims sustained minor injuries and were treated at a hospital. Authorities say this incident was part of a wider conspiracy involving other unsuccessful attempts, including a similar plot the day prior and a separate operation near Nantes shortly thereafter. Of the 25 charged, 18 are now in pre-trial detention, four are under judicial supervision, and three have requested delayed hearings. You might also like: Crypto-linked kidnapping cases in France lead to arrests of over 12, including minors The suspects reportedly come from a variety of backgrounds, with many born in the Paris area and others from places including Senegal, Angola, Russia, and Châtellerault. Defence lawyers have characterized some of the accused as vulnerable youths drawn into criminal activity with promises of quick money, unaware of the severity of the crimes. The investigation gained momentum following mass arrests on 27 May, when French police conducted coordinated raids across Île-de-France and Loire-Atlantique. The operations were led by the Brigade de Répression du Banditisme, France’s specialized anti-gang unit, and focused on dismantling a network allegedly behind multiple crypto-related abduction schemes. French officials believe these incidents may be connected to a criminal organization that recruits operatives via social media to carry out high-risk abductions. Investigators say those arrested so far appear to be foot soldiers and logistics handlers, with the masterminds still at large. As previously reported by crypto.news, French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau met with digital asset industry stakeholders in mid-May to discuss security measures.

2025-06-02T06:09:14,"Czech Justice Minister Resigns Over Bitcoin Scandal","This led to an investigation and political fallout just months after the country passed a major pro-crypto law aligned with the EU’s MiCA framework. Meanwhile, Bitcoin maximalist Max Keiser questioned the staying power of new Bitcoin treasury adopters, like Strive and Trump Media. He believes they lack the discipline shown by Strategy's Michael Saylor during bear markets, and warned of potential unsustainable equity premiums. Across the globe, the IMF flagged Pakistan’s decision to allocate 2,000 megawatts for Bitcoin mining and AI data centers, which raised concerns about energy policy and regulatory oversight amid ongoing IMF loan negotiations. Bitcoin Donation Forces Czech Minister to Step Down Czech Justice Minister Pavel Blazek resigned after widespread criticism over his acceptance and subsequent sale of Bitcoin that was donated by a convicted drug trafficker. The controversy began on May 28 when the Justice Ministry announced via social media that it raised close to 1 billion Czech koruna (or approximately $45 million) by auctioning off close to 500 Bitcoin. These funds were intended to support justice system improvements, including digitization, prison reform, and staff housing. Post from the Justice Ministry However, local media soon revealed that the Bitcoin originated from Tomas Jirikovsky, a criminal that was convicted in 2017 for his role in operating Sheep Marketplace, a dark web platform used for trading illegal goods. In March, Jirikovsky’s lawyer approached Blazek with an offer to donate one-third of the Bitcoin he retained after his release from prison in 2021. Blazek accepted the offer without investigating the source of the cryptocurrency, and claimed during a press conference that he had no means to verify the origin and believed the gesture was motivated by a desire to repent. Pavel Blazek The revelation sparked public outcry and drew a lot of criticism from opposition leaders, who accused Blazek of gross negligence. The Czech police also launched an investigation into the origin of the donated Bitcoin. During his trial, authorities already suspected that Jirikovsky’s crypto holdings were connected to another dark web platform, Nucleus, though Jirikovsky insisted the Bitcoin was legally obtained. This allowed him to keep a portion after serving his sentence. Due to the growing political pressure and with national elections on the horizon, Prime Minister Petr Fiala distanced himself from Blazek, which ultimately prompted the minister’s resignation on May 30. Blazek held firm that he committed no wrongdoing but stated he stepped down to avoid damaging the government’s reputation. The scandal happened against the backdrop of a new pro-crypto legislative shift in Czechia. On Feb. 6, President Petr Pavel signed a landmark law regulating digital assets, which aligned the country’s crypto framework with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. The legislation aims to simplify taxation and encourage innovation in the digital asset sector. Max Keiser Questions Bitcoin Treasury Boom Bitcoin also stirred some doubt from maximalist Max Keiser . He voiced skepticism over the durability of newly emerging Bitcoin treasury companies, and questioned whether they can actually maintain the same level of financial discipline as Michael Saylor’s Strategy during a sustained bear market. In a May 30 post on X , Keiser argued that while Saylor famously continued to accumulate Bitcoin through downturns without selling, these newer firms have yet to be tested under similar conditions. He warned that it is “foolish” to assume these so-called Strategy clones will show comparable conviction, and suggested instead that “Strategy is the Bitcoin of BTC treasury plays.” Saylor’s company serves as a model for crypto-aligned treasury management, and attracted a lot of investor interest from both crypto-native and traditional finance circles. Its stock surged to an all-time high of around $543 on Nov. 21, which ended up pushing a wave of companies to mimic its Bitcoin-centric reserve strategy in hopes of achieving similar financial performance and share price appreciation. Bitcoin holdings (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.net ) Analysts now warn that this proliferation of Bitcoin treasury adopters could result in corporations collectively controlling more than half of Bitcoin’s total supply. Among the most recent entrants, asset management firm Strive announced its Bitcoin treasury transition on May 7. Just weeks later, the Trump Media and Technology Group, which is a media firm partially owned by US President Donald Trump, disclosed a massive $2.5 billion capital raise to buy Bitcoin. Another Strategy-inspired company, Metaplanet, saw its shares trade at an implied Bitcoin premium of $600,000, meaning investors are paying nearly six times more for exposure through equity markets than they would by purchasing Bitcoin directly. This growing premium trend is causing concern among market analysts, who warn that such elevated valuations may be unsustainable if market sentiment shifts or if Bitcoin enters a prolonged correction. IMF Flags Pakistan’s Bitcoin Mining Power Plan Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is concerned about Pakistan’s recent decision to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence data centers. The move is part of Pakistan’s broader digital asset strategy, and was made at a time when the country is engaged in sensitive negotiations for an extended financial assistance program with the IMF. According to local news outlet Samaa, the IMF was not consulted prior to the announcement and is now seeking urgent clarification from Pakistan’s Finance Ministry regarding the legality of cryptocurrency mining, the specifics of the electricity allocation, and the broader implications for energy tariffs and national power distribution. Officials suggest that the IMF’s concerns may complicate the ongoing talks, and sources even pointed out that the economic team is already facing intense scrutiny. The IMF delegation currently in virtual discussions with Pakistani officials is expected to convene a separate session to address the country’s plan to power crypto mining and AI operations. Pakistan’s strategy is anchored by the establishment of the Pakistan Digital Asset Authority (PDAA), which was approved by the Finance Ministry on May 21. This authority will oversee regulation of exchanges, wallets, stablecoins, DeFi platforms, and the tokenization of national assets, aligning its mandate with international compliance frameworks like those of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Bilal Bin Saqib at the Bitcoin 2025 conference The announcement also followed Pakistan’s recent unveiling of its first strategic Bitcoin reserve at the Bitcoin 2025 conference. During the event, Bilal bin Saqib, crypto adviser to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, introduced a national Bitcoin wallet. This reflects Pakistan’s shifting stance on cryptocurrencies, which began earlier in 2025 with the proposal of a National Crypto Council to help draft a full regulatory framework and attract international investment.

The comment was made in a video clip attached to the tweet and has drawn attention within both the Cardano and Bitcoin development communities due to its implications for cross-chain compatibility and infrastructure development. In the video, Hoskinson stated that “Cardano is becoming the de facto dev platform for Bitcoin script,” referencing recent technical advancements made under the BitVMX initiative. He emphasized that Cardano’s platform could serve as the initial entry point for developers working with Bitcoin script. According to Hoskinson, BitVMX will continue to evolve and improve, becoming more capable, more efficient, and supported by a growing ecosystem over time. Hoskinson remarked, “What Cardano has effectively done, because of this work, Cardano is becoming the de facto dev platform for Bitcoin script, if you think about that. And that’s an amazing thing. “So, if you’re a Bitcoin developer now, your first entry point can be through BitVMX, and what you know is that over time that platform is going to get more capable, it’s going to get faster, it’s going to get cheaper to utilize, and ultimately it’s going to have a larger ecosystem around it.” JUST IN: #Cardano $ADA Founder Charles Hoskinson says ""Cardano is becoming the de facto dev platform for Bitcoin script.

This model offers deterministic behavior and concurrency advantages that are significant for developers building complex applications. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While Bitcoin script is known for its simplicity and security, it is also limited in functionality. BitVMX appears to address these limitations by enabling Bitcoin-aligned development within Cardano’s more expressive and scalable environment. Community Endorsement of the Multichain Vision The tweet gained support from members of the crypto developers community. One user, posting under the name T, commented that the cooperation between Bitcoin and Cardano is a meaningful technical innovation. He stated that BitVMX leverages Cardano’s architecture while preserving Bitcoin’s foundational principles. T noted that Cardano’s EUTXO model positions it well for this kind of cross-chain functionality and described the approach as a practical bridge between networks. According to them, BitVMX represents only the initial phase of what could become a broader development trend focused on combining Bitcoin’s security with Cardano’s programmability. Hoskinson Reaffirms Support for Interoperable Infrastructure Charles Hoskinson has previously advocated for multichain cooperation and modular infrastructure in blockchain ecosystems. The remarks regarding BitVMX reinforce that position, suggesting that future development efforts may increasingly focus on interoperability and shared resources between networks, rather than on siloed or isolated ecosystems. As the development of BitVMX progresses and more capabilities are introduced, further interest from Bitcoin developers may follow. The potential for faster and more cost-effective smart contract execution via Cardano’s infrastructure could open up new avenues for Bitcoin-script-based innovation.

Bitcoin BTC hovered around $105,000 in Asian morning hours Monday, slightly changed in the past 24 hours but down 5% over the past week. Ether ETH, XRP XRP, Solana’s SOL SOL, Cardano’s ADA ADA and dogecoin DOGE showed similar price action in the past 24 hours, with signs of a local bottom near support levels for all these tokens, indicating a potential rebound for intraday traders. “Bitcoin hovers around $105K as investors remain uncertain about short-term macroeconomic events,” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research. “Uncertainty around inflation, tariffs, and the US economy slowed bullish trends in crypto, while geopolitical risks have also pushed investors to pull some capital from assets. “We remain optimistic over the long-term outlook for the crypto industry, with more institutions and users onboarding every day,” Ruck added. Trade tensions continue to weigh on risk sentiment. China said Monday that the U.S. had introduced new discriminatory restrictions on AI chip exports and software sales, and vowed to take measures to defend its interests.That backdrop has traders on edge. “Events over the last weekend showed just how quickly cryptocurrencies could react from even a slight escalation in trade war hostilities,” said Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, in a Telegram message to CoinDesk. Mei said traders should monitor announcements from both China and the US, as well as a potential escalation in Russia-Ukraine hostilities and several key US economic data releases this week, including the US trade deficit, unemployment numbers, and remarks from various Fed officials. “Currently macro developments are driving the majority of market movements so it’s difficult to predict, but we do see large institutions continuing to build up their crypto exposure so that’s a positive sign,” Mei added. Meanwhile, investors have been diversifying into tokens like XRP and SOL, even as Bitcoin’s price action has become more aligned with traditional risk assets, which some say adds to the long-term optimism. Kathy Qu, research manager at HashKey Cloud, told CoinDesk on Monday that “trade policy uncertainty drives capital into high-growth tech stocks, but savvy investors are also diversifying further into crypto, particularly TradFi-friendly assets like Bitcoin and XRP, where ETF optimism grows.” She added that staking and DeFi remain bright spots in the market, with real-world asset tokens seeing strong momentum and Ethereum ETFs poised to benefit from the SEC’s staking exemption — a move that’s expected to encourage more institutional participation in the DeFi sector.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/02/doge-xrp-sol-show-price-bottoming-as-bitcoin-traders-remain-optimistic,"BTC|DOGE|SOL|TRADING|XRP","Markets|Dogecoin|XRP|Solana|market analysis|News",cryptocompare

The transaction, flagged by blockchain analysts and tracked by platforms such as Lookonchain and Arkham Intelligence, has sparked a wave of speculation across the crypto community. The funds appear to have passed through Jambler, a centralized Bitcoin mixing service, rather than more widely used decentralized privacy tools like Wasabi or Samourai. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT noted that two dormant addresses, active as far back as 2014 and 2019, deposited large sums into Jambler between April and May. These deposits coincided with the transfer to Ulbricht’s wallet, casting doubt on theories that the donation was a self-transfer from hidden pre-arrest funds. Update: Few entities regularly use Jambler in size so I found a potential demix for the donation. 1Mp5hH originates from late 2014 exchange activity. 1CNDW has 2019 exchange activity and was previously flagged in compliance tools. 1Mp5hH & 1CNDW were depositing in size to… — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) June 2, 2025 ZachXBT Links Ross Ulbricht Donation to Flagged Bitcoin Address According to ZachXBT, the donation likely was not a self-transfer as some had speculated, though it appears to have originated from a “questionable source.” The unusually large size of the gift, coupled with its obscure origin, has raised eyebrows. One of the addresses linked to the transaction, 1CNDW, had previously been flagged in compliance tools, adding to the concerns. Ulbricht Reflects on Prison and Freedom Ulbricht walked free in Jan. 2025 after serving 12 years of a double life sentence. His release followed a controversial pardon issued by US President Donald Trump . Since then, Ulbricht has re-entered public life, speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Nashville and auctioning personal memorabilia, including prison-era art and possessions. The donation arrived shortly after Ulbricht’s auction concluded, which had raised over $1.3m in Bitcoin. However, despite the timing, the 300 BTC transfer was not connected to the sale. This disconnect has only deepened the mystery surrounding its origin. The donation wallet, managed by the FreeRoss.org campaign, funds legal advocacy and public education around sentencing reform. While the money greatly supports these causes, its unclear path, especially through a centralized mixer, has cast a shadow over what might have been a celebratory moment. Meanwhile, Ulbricht addressed a packed audience in Nashville. He reflected on the dramatic shift in his life, recalling moments when he thought he might die in that “awful cage.” Still, he said he fought to find joy, even in the darkest times.

The feature would include disappearing messages and audio/video calling “without a phone number across all platforms.” “All new XChat is rolling out with encryption, vanishing messages and the ability to send any kind of file,” he wrote to his 220 million followers. “Also, audio/video calling.” All new XChat is rolling out with encryption, vanishing messages and the ability to send any kind of file. Also, audio/video calling. This is built on Rust with (Bitcoin style) encryption, whole new architecture. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2025 Rust is a programming language known for its speed, memory safety and concurrency. The new architecture applies encryption methods similar to those used in Bitcoin. XChat: Enhances Privacy, Aligns With Musk’s Vision X (formerly Twitter) initially added its encrypted messaging feature in May 2023 for paid users. To X’s credit, it accompanied the new feature with an article on its help centre , breaking down the new feature’s strengths and weaknesses with unusual transparency. “We’re not quite there yet, but we’re working on it,” Musk said at the time. However, X paused the feature last week in order to focus on “making some improvements,” perhaps linked to the launch of XChat. Further, the feature aligns with Musk’s ambitious “ everything app ” vision, similar to China’s WeChat. With the launch, Musk appears to push for a more decentralized version. XChat is already accessible to some paid users on X. “It’s been a few days since Elon Musk is back in the office and we see that XChat is being rolled out to some users,” Nima Owji, an independent app researcher and web developer, wrote on X. It's been a few days since Elon Musk is back in the office and we see that X Chat is being rolled out to some users! LFG! — Nima Owji (@nima_owji) May 31, 2025 In April, reports revealed that Musk is stepping down from his government role to focus on his businesses. He formally exited as a special government employee at DOGE in May. What is “Bitcoin-Style” Encryption? Following Musk’s announcement of the XChat launch, developers and cryptography experts have pushed back, saying that Bitcoin doesn’t use encryption. Samson Mow, CEO of Jan3, who is working on nation-state BTC adoption, took to X, writing that the world’s largest crypto isn’t encrypted. Bitcoin isn’t encrypted. — Samson Mow (@Excellion) June 1, 2025 Another BTC core developer said that the Rust programming language is woke, explaining that it’s also a bad idea for security reasons. “ Bitcoin doesn’t even use encryption ,” he added.

2025-06-02T05:22:24,"Bitcoin exchange reserves hit an all-time low — is a volatility spike coming?","Bitcoin’s supply on exchanges has fallen to its lowest level, raising expectations for a potential spike in volatility. According to data from CryptoQuant, the total amount of Bitcoin ( BTC ) held across all centralized exchanges decreased to just under 2.5 million BTC as of late May 2025. This steady drop has been accompanied by a strong price rally, with Bitcoin most recently reaching a new all-time high above $111,500. The data indicates a significant divergence between exchange reserves and prices. While the quantity of Bitcoin held on exchanges has been declining, its value has increased. On the CryptoQuant chart, this is illustrated by a white line moving upward for price, and a blue line sloping downward for reserves. Bitcoin price vs. exchange reserves. Credit: CryptoQuant Historically, a declining supply of Bitcoin on exchanges has driven up prices, particularly when demand is high. This is seen by many analysts as an indication that the market may be about to enter a new phase, where sharper moves in either direction are fueled by limited supply.

Strategy added 7,390 BTC in May, bringing its total holdings to 576,230 BTC, roughly 2.75% of total supply, acquired at an average price of $69,726. Other public companies, including GameStop and Japan-based Metaplanet, have also been actively adding to their holdings. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds brought in $5.23 billion in inflows over the past month, according to SoSoValue data . Several governments are following suit. The UAE and Pakistan have stepped up their accumulation efforts, while U.S. lawmakers are discussing the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve. From a technical perspective, Bitcoin appears to be in a wait-and-see phase. Momentum indicators are mixed. The relative strength index stands at 52, showing neutral momentum, while the moving average convergence divergenc has turned slightly bearish. Short-term moving averages indicate some downward pressure but the longer-term outlook remains intact. Bitcoin price analysis.

The rally may continue toward $110,000 or higher if Bitcoin is able to recover its short-term moving average of around $106,000.

2025-06-02T04:33:23,"Metaplanet Adds 1,088 More Bitcoin — Total Portfolio Climbs to 8,888 BTC","Japanese firm Metaplanet has expanded its Bitcoin reserves again, acquiring 1,088 BTC at an average price of 15.5m yen per coin, or about $108,600. The total spend for the purchase came to 16.89b yen, equivalent to roughly $118m, pushing its cumulative Bitcoin holdings to 8,888 BTC. The latest acquisition, disclosed on Monday, is part of Metaplanet’s aggressive shift from its origins as a budget hotel operator to a Bitcoin-first corporate treasury model. That strategy, launched in 2024, has fueled both a meteoric rise in its share price and heightened scrutiny from hedge funds. CEO Simon Gerovich recently remarked that Metaplanet had become Japan’s most shorted stock , warning that betting against Metaplanet is like betting against Bitcoin. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 1,088 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 8,888 BTC* pic.twitter.com/X2clAIKNbR — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) June 2, 2025 Aggressive Bond Issuances Fuel Metaplanet’s Rapid BTC Accumulation To fund its crypto purchases, the company has been tapping capital markets at speed. On May 29, Metaplanet issued $21m through its 17th series of zero-coupon, non-interest-bearing bonds. This followed a $50m bond issuance slightly earlier. Proceeds from both have gone directly into Bitcoin acquisitions. Metaplanet now holds Bitcoin acquired at an average price of 13.76m yen per coin, or about $96,300, totaling 122.27b yen, which translates to about $856m. In just over two months, its holdings have soared from 4,046 BTC at the end of March to 8,888 BTC by early June, more than doubling its position. Metaplanet Cements Its Bitcoin-Centric Strategy With BTC Yield Up 66% The company tracks performance using a proprietary metric called BTC Yield. This measures Bitcoin accumulation per fully diluted share. Between April and June, BTC Yield rose 66.3%. This followed a sharp 95.6% jump in the previous quarter. When converted to yen, and then to dollars, the gains show the impact of Metaplanet’s strategy on shareholder value. This comes despite the dilutive effect of new equity issuance. In Dec. 2024, Bitcoin was formally made a core business vertical. Since then, Metaplanet has steadily pursued its vision through aggressive capital deployment. Now, as one of Asia’s boldest corporate adopters of Bitcoin, the company shows no signs of slowing down.

However, many X Users have dismissed these claims as baseless, as there is no official evidence to back them. Massive Market Crash To Follow? Some experts believe that the crypto market will see a parabolic run if the Fed Chair resigns, but any such event is unlikely as of now. However, if it were to happen, the financial markets would see a massive crash. This is because a sudden loss of leadership at the Federal Reserve would damage confidence in both the U.S. dollar and the broader economy.

Polymarket betters are also not buying the Powell resignation rumors. Despite the discussion on X, the odds on the Polymarket contract “Will Trump remove Jerome Powell in 2025?” held steady at 12%. Just recently, Trump summoned Powell to the White House and criticised him for not cutting the interest rates. But Powell was firm on his decision, saying that the policy decisions will be based on economic data and not politics. The Fed has held rates steady at 4.25% to 4.50% for a third straight meeting. Although Trump continues to push for rate cuts , in a recent interview, he said he has no plans to fire Powell, noting he’ll be able to replace him soon anyway, saying, “it’s in a very short period of time.” .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Supreme Court Says Donald Trump Can’t Fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell , Bitcoin Shows Resilience Recently, the US Dollar crashed to a three-year low, and Wall Street was trading in red.

2025-06-02T03:54:34,"Elon Musk Announces 'Bitcoin-Style' XChat, But Tech Experts Are Skeptical","Tech billionaire Elon Musk, the boss of X (formerly Twitter), announced on Sunday the launch of a brand-new messaging app called XChat. Neither the bitcoin BTC market nor the tech community is impressed. One of the key features of the new offering is that it's built on a programming language called Rust with Bitcoin-style encryption. While it sounds exciting, the crypto community is not particularly psyched, raising doubts about what exactly it means. ""Bitcoin primarily uses signatures, not encryption. This is like saying, we decided to run our rocket on water, since NASA uses Hydrogen and Oxygen,"" Ian Miers, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Maryland, said on X . Encryption refers to the process of scrambling data so that only authorised parties with the correct keys can unscramble and read it. However, transactions executed on the Bitcoin blockchain aren't encrypted but are signed. In fact, all data shared between Bitcoin nodes is unencrypted, allowing total strangers to interact with the network. ""Needless to say ""Bitcoin style"" and ""Rust"" are not descriptions of an encryption scheme, nor are they strong indicators of security for a messaging app. Also, unless encrypted DMs are only in app, odds are they aren't just in Rust,"" Miers said . Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, traded flat near $105,000, having dropped over 3% last week, according to CoinDesk data. Other key features of the new offering include end-to-end encryption, disappearing messages, and the ability to send any type of file, including audio and video files, without a phone number across all platforms.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/06/02/elon-musk-announces-xchat-with-bitcoin-style-encryption-tech-experts-raise-questions,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET","Tech|Bitcoin|Elon Musk|Encryption|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-02T03:43:16,"‘XRP Has No Legal Clarity’: Expert Calls It Crypto’s Biggest Lie, Says XRP Is Clearer Than Bitcoin","The post ‘XRP Has No Legal Clarity’: Expert Calls It Crypto’s Biggest Lie, Says XRP Is Clearer Than Bitcoin appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The long-running legal battle between the SEC and Ripple just took another dramatic turn. Judge Analisa Torres, who has been overseeing the case, has rejected a joint request from both Ripple and the SEC that aimed to wrap up the lawsuit once and for all. This latest move means the fight isn’t over yet. The rejected filing was meant to adjust the penalty terms against Ripple and then clear the way for both sides to pull back their appeals. But Judge Torres wasn’t having it. Does XRP Have Legal Clarity? To add to the drama, there’s been a fresh claim doing the rounds online suggesting “XRP has no legal clarity” and lacks institutional backing. The post claimed no major CBDCs run on XRPL, and that only Bitcoin is part of the U.S. reserve . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why is XRP Price Going Down Today? , This didn’t sit well with pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan, who fired back hard. He called it “the biggest lie I’ve seen in crypto this year,” reminding everyone that Judge Torres already ruled XRP itself is not a security. And importantly — the SEC didn’t appeal that part of the decision. This is a lie. XRP has been found by a judge not itself to be a security. The SEC Appeal did not challenge that finding. To say XRP has no legal clarity is the biggest lie I have seen in crypto this year. https://t.co/6x1AycUxja — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 1, 2025 When someone argued that the judge’s comments were only dicta ( a legal term for remarks not legally binding ), Bill Morgan responded firmly, saying that even a dicta provides a degree of legal clarity. He explained that the reasoning used by Judge Torres is persuasive authority in court — and said that no court has found XRP to be a security, adding, “It has more judicial clarity than Bitcoin, which has none.” What’s Next for XRP? Despite the legal tussles, most experts believe a final resolution is still on the horizon. The rejected filing doesn’t impact XRP’s existing legal clarity or standing, and while the SEC and Ripple will have to revisit their penalty talks, the case’s key outcomes remain unchanged. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!
