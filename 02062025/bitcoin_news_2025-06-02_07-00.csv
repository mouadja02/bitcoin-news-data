2025-06-02T04:33:23,"Metaplanet Adds 1,088 More Bitcoin — Total Portfolio Climbs to 8,888 BTC","Japanese firm Metaplanet has expanded its Bitcoin reserves again, acquiring 1,088 BTC at an average price of 15.5m yen per coin, or about $108,600. The total spend for the purchase came to 16.89b yen, equivalent to roughly $118m, pushing its cumulative Bitcoin holdings to 8,888 BTC. The latest acquisition, disclosed on Monday, is part of Metaplanet’s aggressive shift from its origins as a budget hotel operator to a Bitcoin-first corporate treasury model. That strategy, launched in 2024, has fueled both a meteoric rise in its share price and heightened scrutiny from hedge funds. CEO Simon Gerovich recently remarked that Metaplanet had become Japan’s most shorted stock , warning that betting against Metaplanet is like betting against Bitcoin. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 1,088 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 8,888 BTC* pic.twitter.com/X2clAIKNbR — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) June 2, 2025 Aggressive Bond Issuances Fuel Metaplanet’s Rapid BTC Accumulation To fund its crypto purchases, the company has been tapping capital markets at speed. On May 29, Metaplanet issued $21m through its 17th series of zero-coupon, non-interest-bearing bonds. This followed a $50m bond issuance slightly earlier. Proceeds from both have gone directly into Bitcoin acquisitions. Metaplanet now holds Bitcoin acquired at an average price of 13.76m yen per coin, or about $96,300, totaling 122.27b yen, which translates to about $856m. In just over two months, its holdings have soared from 4,046 BTC at the end of March to 8,888 BTC by early June, more than doubling its position. Metaplanet Cements Its Bitcoin-Centric Strategy With BTC Yield Up 66% The company tracks performance using a proprietary metric called BTC Yield. This measures Bitcoin accumulation per fully diluted share. Between April and June, BTC Yield rose 66.3%. This followed a sharp 95.6% jump in the previous quarter. When converted to yen, and then to dollars, the gains show the impact of Metaplanet’s strategy on shareholder value. This comes despite the dilutive effect of new equity issuance. In Dec. 2024, Bitcoin was formally made a core business vertical. Since then, Metaplanet has steadily pursued its vision through aggressive capital deployment. Now, as one of Asia’s boldest corporate adopters of Bitcoin, the company shows no signs of slowing down.

However, many X Users have dismissed these claims as baseless, as there is no official evidence to back them. Massive Market Crash To Follow? Some experts believe that the crypto market will see a parabolic run if the Fed Chair resigns, but any such event is unlikely as of now. However, if it were to happen, the financial markets would see a massive crash. This is because a sudden loss of leadership at the Federal Reserve would damage confidence in both the U.S. dollar and the broader economy. Powel to resign tomorrow I see lots of these nonsense posts on CT today Let me tell you 1st – it’s not gonna happen 2nd – if that happened, the markets would dump significantly Why?

Polymarket betters are also not buying the Powell resignation rumors. Despite the discussion on X, the odds on the Polymarket contract “Will Trump remove Jerome Powell in 2025?” held steady at 12%. Just recently, Trump summoned Powell to the White House and criticised him for not cutting the interest rates. But Powell was firm on his decision, saying that the policy decisions will be based on economic data and not politics. The Fed has held rates steady at 4.25% to 4.50% for a third straight meeting. Although Trump continues to push for rate cuts, in a recent interview, he said he has no plans to fire Powell, noting he’ll be able to replace him soon anyway, saying, “it’s in a very short period of time.” Bitcoin Shows Resilience Recently, the US Dollar crashed to a three-year low, and Wall Street was trading in red. Now, Bitcoin normally follows the Wall Street sentiment. However, this time it stood strong. So, with Bitcoin showing surprising strength, investors might be eyeing Bitcoin as a safer bet in times of chaos. Some analysts note that Bitcoin does not need QE, saying that institutional adoption and regulations can drive the next bull run too. Bitcoin is currently trading at $104,967.

Neither the BTC market nor the tech community is impressed. One of the key features of the new offering is that it's built on a programming language called Rust with Bitcoin-style encryption. While it sounds exciting, the crypto community is not particularly psyched, raising doubts about what exactly it means. ""Bitcoin primarily uses signatures, not encryption. This is like saying, we decided to run our rocket on water, since NASA uses Hydrogen and Oxygen,"" Ian Miers, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Maryland, said on X . Encryption refers to the process of scrambling data so that only authorised parties with the correct keys can unscramble and read it. However, transactions executed on the Bitcoin blockchain aren't encrypted but are signed. In fact, all data shared between Bitcoin nodes is unencrypted, allowing total strangers to interact with the network. ""Needless to say ""Bitcoin style"" and ""Rust"" are not descriptions of an encryption scheme, nor are they strong indicators of security for a messaging app. Also, unless encrypted DMs are only in app, odds are they aren't just in Rust,"" Miers said . Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, traded flat near $105,000, having dropped over 3% last week, according to CoinDesk data. Other key features of the new offering include end-to-end encryption, disappearing messages, and the ability to send any type of file, including audio and video files, without a phone number across all platforms.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/06/02/elon-musk-announces-xchat-with-bitcoin-style-encryption-tech-experts-raise-questions,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET","Tech|Bitcoin|Elon Musk|Encryption|News",cryptocompare

Judge Analisa Torres, who has been overseeing the case, has rejected a joint request from both Ripple and the SEC that aimed to wrap up the lawsuit once and for all. This latest move means the fight isn’t over yet. The rejected filing was meant to adjust the penalty terms against Ripple and then clear the way for both sides to pull back their appeals. But Judge Torres wasn’t having it. Does XRP Have Legal Clarity? To add to the drama, there’s been a fresh claim doing the rounds online suggesting “XRP has no legal clarity” and lacks institutional backing. The post claimed no major CBDCs run on XRPL, and that only Bitcoin is part of the U.S. reserve. This didn’t sit well with pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan, who fired back hard. He called it “the biggest lie I’ve seen in crypto this year,” reminding everyone that Judge Torres already ruled XRP itself is not a security. And importantly — the SEC didn’t appeal that part of the decision. This is a lie. XRP has been found by a judge not itself to be a security. The SEC Appeal did not challenge that finding. To say XRP has no legal clarity is the biggest lie I have seen in crypto this year. https://t.co/6x1AycUxja — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 1, 2025 When someone argued that the judge’s comments were only dicta (a legal term for remarks not legally binding), Bill Morgan responded firmly, saying that even a dicta provides a degree of legal clarity. He explained that the reasoning used by Judge Torres is persuasive authority in court — and said that no court has found XRP to be a security, adding, “It has more judicial clarity than Bitcoin, which has none.” What’s Next for XRP? Despite the legal tussles, most experts believe a final resolution is still on the horizon. The rejected filing doesn’t impact XRP’s existing legal clarity or standing, and while the SEC and Ripple will have to revisit their penalty talks, the case’s key outcomes remain unchanged.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-has-no-legal-clarity-expert-calls-it-cryptos-biggest-lie-says-xrp-is-clearer-than-bitcoin/,"BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|XRP","News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

2025-06-02T02:08:00,"Ethereum price prediction for June 2024: will ETH rise to $4k?","Ethereum price had a strong performance in May as it finally made a bullish breakout, and the odds of it falling to $1,000 fell. ETH jumped to a high of $2,783, up by 100% from its lowest point this year. This article provides an ETH price prediction for June and what to expect. Ethereum price prediction The daily chart shows that the ETH price crashed to a low of $1,385 in April and then quickly rebounded to a high of $2,783 on May 19. Its highest point was along the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level. Ethereum price has formed a bullish flag pattern, comprising a vertical line and a rectangle pattern. This is one of the most bullish patterns in technical analysis. ETH price has jumped above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, a sign that it is about to form a golden cross pattern. Therefore, the most likely scenario is where the coin finally makes a strong bullish breakout as long as it remains above the 200-day moving average. If this happens, the next point to watch will be the psychological point at $3,000, which is about 20% above the current level. A break above $3,000 will be important because it will boost the chance of it rising to $4,000, the highest point in November last year. A move below the support at $2,300 will invalidate the bullish Ethereum price forecast. ETH price chart | Source: TradingView Top catalysts for the ETH price Ethereum price has numerous catalysts that may push its price higher in June. First, as we wrote on Sunday, Bitcoin price has a strong bullish outlook later this month, helped by its strong supply and demand dynamics. Its ETF demand is rising while supply on exchanges continues to fall. A strong Bitcoin price rebound will likely push other cryptocurrencies higher during the month. That’s because, historically, the two coins have a close correlation with each other. Second, ETH is seeing strong demand from Wall Street investors. The spot ETH ETFs have had strong inflows in the past few weeks. It had inflows in the last three consecutive weeks, bringing the cumulative total to $3.05 billion. Spot ETH ETFs added $285 million last week, up from $248 million and $41.5 million in the last two weeks. They also had inflows for two consecutive months. Third, data shows that the supply of Ethereum held in exchanges continued to fall, a sign that holders are not selling as much. There are now 7.6 million coins, down from 10.75 million in January. Falling exchange volume is a bullish sign that investors are no longer selling as they did before. Further, there are signs that whales are still accumulating Ethereum, possibly because they believe it is a bargain. The supply held by whales has jumped to 103.6 million, up from 102 million in February. ETH whales chart | Source: Santiment Ethereum has more bullish fundamentals. For example, RWA data shows that it is the biggest chain in the real-world-asset tokenization industry, which has over $23 billion in on-chain assets. Ethereum has a 59% market share in this industry, and is followed by ZKsync Era, Stellar, Aptos, Solana, and Polygon. Ethereum is also the biggest player in decentralized finance (DeFi) with over $131 billion in assets and $124 billion in stablecoins. Its $131 billion TVL gives it a market share to 61%, while its stablecoin assets account for about 50% of all assets. Therefore, these fundamentals will point to more gains.

Potential Boost from Ripple-SEC Case: A favorable legal outcome could reshape XRP’s future and spark a bullish reversal. The price of XRP has been under pressure lately , and traders are closely watching some key levels on the charts. After recently hitting a high near $2.47, XRP has struggled to hold steady and has been stuck in a downtrend. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $2.17, slightly recovering after dipping to a low of $2.13 earlier. The price is battling to stay above the important average level of $2.15, but it hasn’t been easy. Important Levels To Watch Right now, XRP is retesting an important Fibonacci support zone between $2.10 and $2.15. This level has provided strong support in the past, and bulls will need to defend it to prevent further losses. If the price drops below $2.10 and confirms with a daily candle close, things could get worse. In that case, the next support levels to watch would be around $2.05 and then possibly closer to $2.00. A break below $2.00 could be bad news for XRP, with the risk of a fall towards $1.80–$1.70. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : ‘XRP Has No Legal Clarity’: Expert Calls It Crypto’s Biggest Lie, Says XRP Is Clearer Than Bitcoin , Resistance on the Way Up On the upside, there’s tough resistance waiting between $2.30 and $2.34, with more sellers likely around $2.44 and then between $2.56 and $2.62. Unless XRP can break through these zones, it’s unlikely to see any strong bullish moves soon. XRP’s recent drop follows broader market weakness. Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies also fell and tested key support levels after uncertainty over U.S. tariff news weighed on investor sentiment. However, there’s a silver lining for XRP holders. Ripple’s long-running legal battle with the SEC might be nearing its end , and if the outcome is favorable, it could reshape XRP’s regulatory status.

2025-06-02T00:22:59,"Asia Morning Briefing: BTC Stalls at 105K as Analyst Says Market Looks 'Overheated'","Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin BTC is trading above $105K as Asia begins its business week. The world's largest digital asset remained relatively stable over the weekend, with a 0.4% movement, and trading volume was compressed. While overall market conditions remain bullish, a new report from CryptoQuant suggests that certain metrics indicate the BTC market is “overheating.” The report shows bitcoin demand has climbed to 229,000 BTC over the past 30 days, approaching the December 2024 peak of 279,000 BTC. At the same time, whale-held balances have risen by 2.8 percent, a pace that often signals slowing accumulation. These indicators suggest the current rally, which pushed prices to a record $112,000, may be nearing a short-term top. The report highlights $120,000 as the next major resistance level, tied to the upper band of the Traders’ On-chain Realized Price, where unrealized profits would hit 40 percent, a threshold that has historically marked local tops. While CryptoQuant’s ""Bull Score Index"" remains strong at 80, signaling continued bullish momentum, rising profit margins, and peaking demand growth suggest traders may face a period of consolidation before the next leg higher. News Roundup: James Wynn Gets Liquidated, But Says He'll 'Run it All Back' James Wynn, a trader renowned for his aggressive, high-leverage bets on Hyperliquid, has been fully liquidated, leaving him with just $23 in his account after sustaining losses totaling more than $17 million, CoinDesk previously reported. Wynn, who attracted significant attention with trades involving bitcoin, memecoins like PEPE, and even obscure tokens such as FARTCOIN, first faced steep declines from a massive $1.25 billion long position on BTC, resulting in a loss exceeding $37 million after prices dipped below $105,000 amid geopolitical turmoil. Throughout the volatile month, Wynn rapidly cycled through trades, briefly netting an unrealized gain of $85 million before market swings wiped him out completely. An account associated with Wynn downplayed the dramatic liquidation, defiantly stating on X: ""I'll run it back, I always do. And I'll enjoy doing it. I like playing the game. I took a large and calculated bet at making billions."" Brazil's Méliuz Shares Sink 8% After Announcing $78M Equity Raise to Buy Bitcoin Brazilian fintech Méliuz plans to raise up to $78 million through a public equity offering, intending to allocate all proceeds to purchasing Bitcoin and positioning the cryptocurrency as a primary strategic asset in its treasury, CoinDesk previously reported . However, Méliuz’s strategy hasn't impressed the market yet, as shares dropped more than 8% following the announcement. The initial offering includes 17 million common shares, with the potential to expand up to 51 million, and investors will receive subscription warrants allowing future stock purchases at set prices. Known for its cashback and financial services platform serving over 30 million users, Méliuz currently holds 320.2 BTC, having previously committed 10% of its cash reserves to Bitcoin in March. Trading for the subscription warrants is expected to commence on June 16, with share settlement and warrant issuance finalized by June 18. NYC Comptroller Rejects Mayor Adams' 'BitBond', Warns Deviating from Dollar Could Undermine City's Credit Reputation New York City's Comptroller Brad Lander sharply criticized Mayor Eric Adams' plan to issue municipal bonds backed by bitcoin, labeling the proposed ""BitBond"" as ""legally dubious and fiscally irresponsible,"" CoinDesk previously reported. Lander rejected the idea just days after Adams introduced it at a bitcoin conference in Las Vegas, emphasizing that cryptocurrency's instability makes it unsuitable to reliably fund critical city projects such as infrastructure and affordable housing. Mayor Adams has actively promoted cryptocurrency initiatives since entering office, including converting his own paychecks into digital assets and establishing a digital asset advisory council. However, Comptroller Lander highlighted serious practical concerns with the BitBond proposal, noting federal tax laws and city financial regulations would make the proposal unworkable, and warned that deviating from the dollar-based municipal borrowing system could undermine investor confidence and New York City's credit reputation. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin showed resilience, staging a V-shaped recovery between $103,813.37 and $105,305.75 amid notable volume spikes. ETH: Ethereum formed a bullish reversal pattern, rebounding from strong support at $2,472.84 to $2,527.53 amid high-volume buying momentum, according to CoinDesk's Market Insight Bot. Gold: Gold climbed 0.6% to $3,311.66, as traders weighed its recent retreat from record highs against ongoing investor and central bank appetite driven by uncertainty over US tariffs and broader economic risks. Nikkei 225: Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 0.89% as Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed following Trump's announcement of increased steel tariffs. S&P 500 Futures: Stock futures dipped Sunday to start June after the S&P 500's strongest month since November 2023, amid uncertainty over President Trump's tariffs following recent contradictory court rulings.

2025-06-02T00:02:00,"Top crypto price predictions: Flare, Horizen, Cookie DAO","Top crypto prices were mixed on Monday morning, continuing the recent trend in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin’s price held steady above $105,000, while Ethereum’s price was above $2,500. This article provides forecasts for the top three coins like Flare (FLR), Horizen (ZEN), and Cookie DAO (COOKIE). Flare price forecast ahead of a big unlock FLR price chart | Source: TradingView Flare token rose as traders focused on the upcoming token unlock later this week. It will unlock tokens worth over $39 million , equivalent to 3% of the total tokens in circulation. Token unlocks are usually bearish since they introduce new coins in the market, boosting supplies. The daily chart shows that the Flare token price was trading at $0.020 on Monday, a few points higher than the weekend low of $0.01623. It is also about 80% above the lowest point this year. ZEN price has remained above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), a sign that bulls remains in control for now. It also formed a hammer candlestick on Friday, which explains why it has risen in the past two days. A hammer comprises of a small body and a long lower wick. Flare price has also formed a falling wedge pattern, a popular bullish reversal pattern. Therefore, the coin will likely rebound, with the next point to watch being at $0.02240, its highest point in May. Horizen price prediction as a wedge forms ZEN price chart | Source: TradingView Horizen token price was trading at $9.955 on Monday morning, up by 55% from its lowest point in April. This recovery is because of the ongoing crypto market rally and demand for privacy coins. Horizen price was hovering between the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. It has also formed a rising wedge, comprising of two ascending and converging trendlines. A wedge is one of the most bearish patterns in technical analysis. This breakdown normally happens when the two lines are about to converge. In ZEN’s case, the two lines have a long way to converge, meaning that the consolidation will continue. The key support and resistance levels are $9 and $12.5. Cookie DAO price forecast Read more: Bitcoin price prediction for June: Will BTC rise or fall in June? Cookie price chart | Source: TradingView Cookie price has done well in the past few weeks as it jumped by 260% from the lowest point in April. This surge has brought the market cap to over $130 million, making it a top player in the BSC Chain network. The eight-hour chart shows that the Cookie price formed a cup and handle pattern, a popular bullish continuation sign. The lower side of this cup is at $0.070, while the upper side is at $0.30. This means that the cup has a depth of about 75%. The recent retreat was part of the formation of the handle section of the cup. Therefore, by measuring 75% from the cup’s upper side, we can estimate the most likely Cookie price prediction at $0.54, which is about 112% above the current level. A drop below the support at $0.2100 will invalidate the bullish outlook.

2025-06-02T00:00:15,"Insurance Companies Looking To Capitalize on Crypto Investors Who Fear Kidnapping: Report","Insurance companies are reportedly looking to capitalize on the rising incidents of kidnapping and physical violence targeting crypto millionaires. NBC News reports that at least three companies that provide insurance and security services for cryptocurrency investors and firms are preparing to offer kidnap and ransom (K&R) insurance policies for those with security concerns stemming from their crypto holdings. According to Rebecca Rubenfeld, chief operating officer at the crypto insurance firm AnchorWatch, the fear of violence was a big topic at the annual Bitcoin Conference that was held in Las Vegas last week. “They’re tense. I’m not saying that because I’m trying to sell insurance, but overall, the mood is a very good environment for me.” AnchorWatch is considering offering kidnapping and ransom protection in the coming months. The news comes after a string of reports emerged about the kidnapping of crypto investors. Last month, armed assailants reportedly tried to abduct the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noiza, the CEO of the French crypto exchange platform Paymium, in Paris. In another incident, three teenagers allegedly stole $4 million worth of cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) from a man who hosted a crypto-related event in Las Vegas and left him stranded at White Hills, Arizona. And last week in New York City, a kidnapper allegedly tortured and threatened a crypto investor for three weeks to gain access to his Bitcoin ( BTC ) wallet.

2025-06-01T23:30:41,"Is Ethereum Price Gearing Up For A Monster Rally? ETH Up 80% The Last Time This Happened","The Ethereum price has slowed down — repeatedly failing to breach the resistance zone around $2,800 — over the past few weeks after making a strong start to the month of May. The second-largest cryptocurrency will aim to replicate this brilliant form in the early days of June in order to reclaim the coveted $3,000 level over the coming months. Since losing the $3,000 level in early February, the price of ETH has struggled to build a sustained bullish momentum, reaching only above $2,700 multiple times in the past few weeks. However, recent market data shows that the Ethereum price could be preparing for an extended rally over the next few months. What Do Ether Whales Know? In a May 31 post on the social media platform X, pseudonymous crypto analyst Darkfost provided an on-chain outlook on the Ethereum price momentum and investor sentiment. According to the market analyst, an on-chain signal that preceded a significant price rally for ETH in the past has gone off. The relevant indicator here is Ethereum’s Average Order Size on Binance, which is calculated by dividing the total trading volume by the number of trades on the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange (by trading volume). This metric offers insights into the classes of traders — whether it is large institutional investors or retail traders — that are most dominant on a specific exchange. Based on this on-chain metric, the Ethereum large investors are once again back in the market, as shown by the whale orders on Binance since May 19. Darkfost said the chart below provides “an instant snapshot of Ethereum’s sentiment and momentum on Binance, while combining key market data on spot and futures activity, cumulative volumes, with moving averages comparison.” The on-chain analyst added: In short, it’s an all-in-one signal, and today, it’s flashing something rare and powerful because the last time this indicator lit up like this was in December 2023, right before ETH rocketed from $ 2,200 to $ 4,000. Darkfost also mentioned that whales aren’t always trying to find a low entry point, but rather position themselves early when a broader trend begins to show signs of strength. With the average orders on Binance predominantly placed by whales, it implies that the Ethereum price could be gearing up for another 80% move over the next few weeks. Hence, Darkfost believes the month of May might have been a huge entry window, which most of the large investors seemingly took advantage of.

2025-06-01T23:00:48,"Google Gemini Predicts Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price for June 30, 2025","The cryptocurrency landscape, particularly the world of meme coins, continues to draw attention from traders, investors, and enthusiasts eager to decipher short-term price trends. Among these speculative digital assets, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has remained a top favorite, captivating the crypto community with its vibrant ecosystem, strong community backing, and meme-driven hype. As June 2025 begins, many are eager to understand where SHIB might head by month’s end. In this analysis, we delve into Google Gemini’s AI-generated price predictions for Shiba Inu (SHIB) by June 30, 2025, and explore the underlying market conditions that could influence these outcomes. Current Market Snapshot As of report time, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.00001297. SHIB’s price movement over the past few weeks has been largely sideways, with occasional dips reflecting the prevailing bearish sentiment. While major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dictate general market momentum, meme coins like SHIB are especially vulnerable to sharp swings in sentiment, often reacting intensely to social media trends, whale activity, and ecosystem announcements. Google Gemini’s price predictions for June 30, 2025, acknowledge these dynamics and offer three distinct scenarios: modest, moderate, and bullish. Each scenario is grounded in current price action and potential short-term developments, avoiding heavy reliance on third-party analyst forecasts. Modest Scenario In the modest outlook, Google Gemini suggests that if current bearish pressures persist or if the market remains largely stagnant, SHIB is likely to hover near its present levels or experience a minor decline. This places the expected price range between $0.000012 and $0.000013 by the end of June. Such a scenario assumes that no major catalysts emerge to drive fresh buying momentum. Without news of ecosystem upgrades, major partnerships, or substantial improvements in Shiba Inu’s DeFi, gaming, or metaverse initiatives, the token may simply follow the broader crypto market’s consolidation pattern. Moderate Scenario The moderate prediction envisions a more optimistic, albeit restrained, trajectory for SHIB. If minor positive developments occur, such as incremental upgrades in the Shibarium layer-2 network, enhanced staking mechanisms, or small but impactful partnership announcements, the token could experience a slight boost. Google Gemini forecasts that under these circumstances, SHIB might trade between $0.0000135 and $0.0000145 by June 30. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This outcome also hinges on a mild shift in investor sentiment. Even a subtle change in the risk appetite of retail traders or a temporary uptick in meme coin enthusiasm on platforms like X could propel SHIB modestly higher. While not indicative of a full-fledged bull run, this middle-ground scenario suggests that SHIB retains some room for short-term growth if supported by favorable, albeit limited, catalysts. Bullish Outlook For the bullish scenario, Google Gemini emphasizes the need for a significant uptick in buying pressure, which could push SHIB into the $0.000015 to $0.000017 range by the end of June. Achieving this bullish outcome would require a combination of factors, including a reversal in the broader crypto market’s risk sentiment and substantial, SHIB-specific catalysts. Potential triggers might include a surprise rally in Bitcoin or Ethereum, which often lifts altcoins alongside it, or headline-making developments within the SHIB ecosystem. For example, large-scale Shibarium adoption, accelerated token burns, or the introduction of a highly anticipated project within the SHIB metaverse could ignite fresh investor excitement. Notably, given the bearish tone characterizing early June, achieving such a rapid turnaround would demand not just incremental news but a compelling, confidence-restoring event. The Unpredictable Nature of Meme Coins While these predictions provide structured estimates, it’s essential to underscore the speculative nature of meme coins like Shiba Inu. Unlike blue-chip assets with strong institutional backing and clear utility, meme coins are particularly susceptible to sudden shifts driven by social media trends, influencer commentary, and retail trading frenzies. Even AI-generated forecasts, no matter how sophisticated, cannot fully account for the unpredictable emotional surges that often define the meme coin market. While the modest and moderate scenarios appear more likely in the absence of dramatic market shifts, the crypto market’s inherently unpredictable nature leaves the door open for a surprise bullish surge. Traders and investors are reminded to approach meme coins with caution, balancing enthusiasm with sound risk management.

2025-06-01T22:37:40,"Market Players Conflicted over the Arrival of Altcoin Season, Here’s What They’re Saying","Cryptocurrency personalities share different sentiments regarding the highly talked-about altcoin season, a period in the crypto market when alternative assets outperform Bitcoin in the majority. According to entrepreneur and Bitcoin investor Lark Davis, Bitcoin’s recent bullish performance has failed to stimulate excitement within the broader cryptocurrency market. The investor is convinced the missing piece is the highly anticipated altcoin season. “This cycle has been mostly about Bitcoin so far. Even though BTC smashed through all-time highs, there’s no excitement in the market. The reason is simple: Everyone and their dog are sitting in altcoins, and that’s why even though BTC is near ATHs, altcoin index is sitting at 27 (real altseason starts at 75).” He wrote . As the analyst asserts, Bitcoin has outperformed this in this current market cycle, with a continuous bullish milestone recorded monthly. The asset kicked off 2025 hovering above the $90,000 price mark, before hitting $100,000 briefly, in the latter part of January and February. Last week, Bitcoin hit a new ATH of $111,970 before returning below the $110,000 level. The big bull is trading at a press time price of $109,795. On the other hand, Cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen observed that altcoin and Bitcoin pairs are trading at significantly lower levels. Countering that altcoin season is around the corner, he highlighted the continued downward trend observed within the altcoin market over the last 4 years. “ALT/BTC pairs just put in their lowest weekly close all cycle. Those that call for alt season each week may sound confident and contrarian, but altcoins have been bleeding to Bitcoin almost non-stop since 2021.” Cowen wrote . Where is “altcoin season”? While altcoin season is typically expected to arrive 6-9 months after every Bitcoin halving, the years after the halving year leave analysts gauging, using altcoin season index aggregators designed to analyze the performance of the top 50 altcoins in the market. These aggregators track factors including increased trading volume, increased altcoin dominance, and frequent price breakouts. Altcoin season indexes currently sit at 16, indicating that only 16% of existing altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over 90 days. It is also worth noting that altcoins fail to outperform Bitcoin during some market cycles and continue to trade downward or sideways.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/market-players-conflicted-over-the-arrival-of-altcoin-season-heres-what-theyre-saying/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Cryptocurrency|News|Altcoin|Cryptocurrency News",cryptocompare

2025-06-01T22:27:25,"Standard Chartered Sticks to its Gun, Says Bitcoin Could Hit $500,000 Before Trump Leaves Office","Bitcoin proponents clarified that their outlook for the largest cryptocurrency by market cap is especially bullish after the asset crossed $111,000. As expectations for the coming weeks heighten, price predictions are flying in consistently. Standard Chartered, the British multinational bank, is one notable institution that has doubled down on its previous Bitcoin price forecast, which can be considered one of the boldest price predictions made thus far. According to the international bank, Bitcoin is on track to hit the $500,000 price mark before President Donald Trump exits office. Notably, the current president’s second term, which began on January 20, 2025, will elapse on January 20, 2029. As such, the bank is optimistic that Bitcoin could build enough momentum over four years to attain a 358.926% increase in value. Geoffrey Kendrick, the global head of Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered, points to a rise in institutional interest as a catalyst for a long-term price boom. “The 13F data from the US Securities and Exchange Commission supports our core thesis that Bitcoin will reach $500,000 before Trump leaves office. Bitcoin is attracting a wide range of institutional players.” Kendrick asserted. According to the SEC , Form 13F is a “statutory directive” created to inform the public about the securities holdings of leading institutional investors. Kendrick explains the significance of the data, stating the following; “The quarterly 13F data is the best test of our thesis that BTC will attract new institutional buyer types as the market matures, helping the price reach our USD 500,000 target level.” He added. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is kicking off the new week on a lukewarm note, with bulls failing to hold above the $110,000 mark. Although gains sustained over the last 7 days are up 5.70%, hourly losses sit at 0.08% during this report.

2025-06-01T22:00:19,"Bitwise CIO Applauds Community For XRP Success","Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan believes the XRP community is a crucial contributor to the ecosystem’s outlook. To this end, he noted that the success of the native coin is largely a function of its community’s strength. Hougan reached this conclusion after attending a Ripple event recently in Las Vegas. Bitcoin Success is Not a Threat to XRP The Bitwise CIO posted about his return from the XRP conference event on X, noting that approximately 1000 were in attendance. Reacting to the May 31 post, Vijar Kohli, an X user who doubles as a financier at Golden Door, asked him if there were any good takeaways from the event. Houghan mentioned that members of the Ripple community gradually understand that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ripple-associated XRP serve different markets. He made sure to establish that the success of Bitcoin is not a threat to XRP. “BTC thriving doesn’t disrupt what XRP aims to achieve,” Hougan clarified. In the wake of the event, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse attempted to foster unity between the two blockchains. This led him to say that the Bitcoin community is not an enemy. Ripple Says Bitcoin is Environmentally Friendly Ordinarily, such a statement would be expected to mend the broken fence between both communities. Eventually, it seems like it has achieved little to nothing. As part of the broader effort to appreciate Bitcoin’s progress, Chris Larsen, Ripple co-founder, says he now views Bitcoin as sufficiently environmentally friendly. He took this stance after the share of mining powered by renewable energy topped 50%. It is worth noting that Larsen was backing a Greenpeace campaign targeting Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm. Some Bitcoin enthusiasts think the statement of the Ripple executive is just a tactic to fix reputational damage. Bitwise XRP ETF Awaits SEC Approval In other related matters, Bitwise is still awaiting the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decision on its spot XRP Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). It first filed an S-1 registration statement for this offering in October 2024. The proposed ETF was intended to track the value of XRP without direct exposure to crypto risks. Bitwise named BNY Mellon its trust’s administrator and Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC, the custodian of the XRP ETF. There is still a prospect of approval from the SEC.

2025-06-01T21:59:21,"$300 SOL Price Target in Play as Next Signal Awaited","Solana (SOL) is witnessing vigorous on-chain activity as it waits for a new bullish signal from the larger crypto market. The sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is all set to target the $300 level in the near future as it tries to take control of its destiny. According to popular crypto analyst Don on X (formerly Twitter), technical indicators show that the major digital asset is set to reach this important milestone in the coming months. 14-Day Price Action SOL is changing hands below the $175 level at press time. Here is its price action from the last two weeks: Image Source: TradingView SOL has been relatively steady overall during this period. Still, the bulls could have done much better, because premier cryptocurrency Bitcoin posted a new All-Time High (ATH) of $112,000 about a week ago. The move was expected to kickstart the next altcoin season, but it didn’t as BTC dropped slightly in value and is now hovering around $108,000. A definitive move ahead from the top cryptocurrency by market capitalization is likely to create a spark for other digital currencies to follow. SOL has been unable to break free of the $200 price resistance recently, but for these smaller coins, a jump like that doesn’t take much time, especially if the right conditions present themselves. The Solana bulls must wait for the opportune moment before striking. SOL Showing Strong Growth SOL will likely be a major part of this highly anticipated bull market. The programmable digital currency ecosystem remains one of the most sought-after networks for developers because of its immense capability and growing acceptability. The Solana blockchain’s Total Value Locked (TVL) is now nearing $10 billion and showing no signs of slowing down. A recent development involves Solana Strategies, a Canadian company specializing in capital raising through the Solana blockchain. The blockchain firm recently filed for a $1 billion preliminary short-form base shelf prospectus to increase financial flexibility and capitalize on emerging opportunities. In simple terms, the move will allow the organization to raise massive funds for various financial instruments it intends to offer via the SOL blockchain. The move indicates the growing acceptance of Solana in the capital markets, which is a significant advantage considering its relatively subdued overall performance in the cryptocurrency market.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/300-sol-price-target-in-play-as-next-signal-awaited/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING","Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana",cryptocompare

2025-06-01T21:18:07,"Significant Cryptocurrency Bill Unveiled in South Korea – Expected to Pass Easily","The South Korean National Assembly is preparing to take an important step towards the legalization of tokenized securities (Security Tokens, ST). The bill, which is expected to pass after the election, has caused great activity in the financial sector. The country's leading financial institutions are rapidly establishing collaborations and continuing technical infrastructure preparations in order to be pioneers in this new market. Tokenized securities are known as digital securities supported by blockchain technology. Thanks to the security and ease of transaction offered by this technology, it is possible to divide low-liquid assets such as real estate, works of art, and even live animals into small shares and offer them to investors. Currently, tokenized securities remain in a gray area due to a lack of regulation. However, both main candidates running in the presidential election, Lee Jae-myung and Kim Moon-soo, have made it clear in their campaign promises that tokenized securities will be legalized quickly, making the bill’s passage almost certain. Related News: Michael Saylor Gives Another Bullish Signal That He Will Buy Bitcoin: Here's How Much BTC He Currently Owns The fact that tokenized securities are both based on real assets and have the status of a security has led to a serious consensus among political parties in this area. This makes it easier for the law to pass. According to industry representatives, this digital asset class is seen as “the safest innovation.” With the passing of the law, an increase in tokenized investment products based on familiar assets such as real estate is expected in the short term. In the long term, it is predicted that the market structure will change radically as traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds, become tokenized. These blockchain-based digital securities promise to lower transaction costs by reducing dependence on centralized intermediary institutions, while enabling automatic transactions powered by artificial intelligence thanks to their programmability. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-01T21:03:00,"Majority of Crypto Users Start With Meme Coins Before Expanding Portfolios: Gemini Report","Over the last year, meme coins have garnered significant attention in the space, attracting high trading volumes and generating returns of several thousand percent in a matter of hours in some cases, despite being highly controversial. These often-viral assets are doing more than just making headlines. Meme Coins Spark Broader Crypto Participation According to the latest report titled “State of Crypto” by Winklevoss twins-led crypto exchange Gemini, meme coins are encouraging newcomers to explore the digital asset industry. This was found after conducting a survey of 7,205 consumers in the US, UK, France, Italy, Singapore, and Australia (approximately 1,200) consumers per country. A large majority – a whopping 94% – of meme coin holders also hold other types of cryptocurrencies, suggesting that meme coins act as a bridge into the broader crypto ecosystem. Many users appear to begin their journey with these tokens before branching out. For example, 31% of US investors who own both meme coins and traditional cryptocurrencies say meme coins were their first crypto purchase. That trend is similarly reflected in Australia and the UK, which trailed with 28% each, followed by Singapore with 23%, Italy with 22%, and France with 19%. Interestingly, France also leads in overall meme coin ownership, with 67% of its crypto investors holding at least one. The trend continues across other regions with Singapore at 59%, Italy at 58%, the UK at 57%, the US at 55%, and Australia at 45%. Europe Leads Crypto Ownership Zooming out, crypto ownership has grown steadily across multiple regions following the 2022 market downturn. Europe reported a notable rise. In 2025, 24% of UK respondents said they owned cryptocurrency, up from 18% in 2024. France saw a similar rise, with ownership increasing to 21%, also from 18% the previous year. Analysts attribute this growth in part to a more favorable regulatory climate in Europe, driven by the phased rollout of the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework over the last two years. Singapore recorded the highest rate of crypto ownership among the surveyed countries, with 28% of respondents reporting they hold digital assets. In the United States, President Donald Trump’s recent crypto-friendly policies are also influencing public sentiment. After vowing to support digital assets during his campaign, Trump has launched a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, restructured the SEC toward a more innovation-driven stance, and backed legislation aimed at regulating stablecoins and broader crypto markets. Additionally, he introduced a Trump-branded meme coin, which reached nearly $3 billion in market cap this month. These developments appear to be boosting confidence among potential investors. Nearly 23% of non-crypto owners in the US said the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve made them more confident in crypto’s value. Trump’s initiatives are having an international ripple effect on attitudes toward digital asset investment, as 21% of non-crypto owners in the UK and 19% in Singapore echoed a similar sentiment.

2025-06-01T20:58:48,"Elon Musk said X is launching XChat with Bitcoin-style encryption","Elon Musk announced on Sunday through a post on X that the platform is rolling out an entirely new messaging tool called XChat. According to Elon, the new feature includes end-to-end encryption, disappearing messages, support for any file type, and cross-platform audio and video calling without requiring a phone number. He said it’s built in Rust, powered by “Bitcoin-style encryption”, and developed with an entirely new system framework. The feature works across all devices and doesn’t need a SIM card or cellular number to function, which is a huge departure from the way rivals like WhatsApp and Telegram tie accounts to phone numbers. Elon’s approach is built for anonymity, portability, and multi-platform access without depending on mobile carriers. New system uses Bitcoin-grade encryption but faces quantum risk Elon’s reference to “Bitcoin-style encryption” is tied to elliptic curve cryptography, or ECC. This encryption method is what Bitcoin uses to protect transactions and digital signatures. The reason it’s used is because it offers strong protection with far smaller key sizes than older methods like RSA. A 256-bit ECC key can provide similar security to a 3072-bit RSA key, making it faster and less demanding on memory or bandwidth. ECC works based on the math of elliptic curves over finite fields, allowing it to handle key agreements, digital signatures, and encryption through a structure that’s tough to break using traditional computing. But researchers are raising new concerns about how long ECC will actually stay safe. It was once thought that breaking ECC with a quantum computer would take an insane amount of resources, but recent breakthroughs show that it could actually be cracked 20 times faster than originally believed. That brings up questions about how secure XChat will be in a few years when quantum machines mature. The problem lies in what’s called the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem, which ECC relies on. If a system could reverse that problem quickly, like a quantum computer might, it would make it easier to break into encrypted conversations or spoof digital signatures. For now, it’s still a solid cryptographic standard, but the clock is ticking on how futureproof it really is. Cryptographic structure inside XChat built around elliptic curve protocols XChat’s security system appears to use a mix of ECC-based schemes. One is the Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) protocol, which helps both users create a shared private key without ever sending it across the internet. Then there’s ECIES, which is what handles the actual message encryption using that shared key. Together, they make sure messages stay private from end to end. For verifying who’s sending what, XChat could use ECDSA, the same digital signature method Bitcoin uses. There are also advanced options like EdDSA, which uses a different type of curve known as twisted Edwards curves and also allow for faster and more secure signature verification, which would come in handy for large-scale messaging apps. The system is also capable of handling things like ECMQV, which is a more secure key agreement scheme designed to block fake users from getting in the middle of conversations. And there’s even a possibility XChat might support ECQV implicit certificates, which allow user identities to be confirmed without needing a big centralized public key infrastructure. That kind of system could reduce reliance on big certificate authorities while still giving users verified encryption. All these encryption tools are centered around one idea: you can multiply a number with a point on a curve, but you can’t figure out what the number was just by looking at the result. It sounds simple, but the math is complicated enough that even the best computers in the world can’t brute-force it… well at least not yet. XChat’s codebase is written in Rust, a programming language that’s popular among developers building secure systems. Rust reduces memory-related bugs and is considered safer than older options like C++. Combined with the smaller key sizes and lower power consumption of ECC, that makes XChat optimized for both mobile and desktop use. Whether this setup will hold against quantum attacks is still unknown. But it sure would be interesting to live through regardless.

2025-06-01T20:53:07,"A Massive Amount of Mysterious BTC Was Transferred to Ross Ulbricht, Who Lost All His Bitcoin to the US Government – What Does This Mean?","Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht is back in the spotlight for the first time since he was released from custody following a presidential pardon in January. Released after 11 years in prison, Ulbricht auctioned off his personal belongings four months later and soon received a mysterious Bitcoin transfer worth millions of dollars. Several of Ulbricht’s personal belongings, including ID cards from his prison years, a blank rehabilitation notebook and oil paintings he made while in prison, were put up for sale on the Bitcoin-based auction platform Scarce City. The auction raised a total of 12.31 BTC, or about $1.3 million at current prices. The highest bid was Ulbricht’s last prison ID card, issued just months before his release. It sold for 5.5 BTC (around $600,000). Ulbricht said that a guard asked him not to smile during his ID photoshoot, but he smiled anyway: “My joy comes from within, so I smiled that day, even though I was in prison.” Related News: One of the Big Names in the Cryptocurrency Industry Allegedly on the Brink of Bankruptcy: Rapid Denial from the Company Immediately following the auction, a single transaction of 300 BTC (approximately $31 million) was made to a donation wallet linked to Ulbricht. This large transfer was spotted by Lookonchain and confirmed to have been transferred to Ulbricht’s donation wallet by Arkham Intelligence data. Some commentators suggested that this transaction might not have been a genuine donation at all, but a self-transfer from wallets Ulbricht had access to before his arrest in 2013. More than 2.6 BTC were previously donated to Ulbricht in January, the day he was pardoned by President Donald Trump, in over 170 transactions. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-01T20:41:00,"This $0.07 XRP Alternative Could Surge To Over $5 If The Bitcoin Price Hits $150,000 In 2025","Analysts have outlined bold projections for Remittix (RTX), suggesting that if the Bitcoin price hits $150,000, then the XRP alternative is on track to reach $5. Supporting these claims is Remittix’s real-world utility, presale momentum and strong fundamentals. Remittix is filling the gap XRP left behind by offering innovative solutions to the challenges in global payments. As Bitcoin forms an accumulation launchpad to break its all-time high, all eyes are on this PayFi sensation for explosive returns. Let’s delve deeper! Remittix (RTX): XRP alternative with practical solutions Source: Remittix XRP has been in the front seat in blockchain payments for a long time. Yet with its regulatory concerns and institutional hurdles, many are wondering whether it is still the frontrunner in 2025. In the meantime, Remittix is stepping up by providing a retail-oriented model that gives quick, low-fee crypto-to-fiat payments. While Ripple is focusing on large institutions, Remittix is targeting individuals, freelancers, and businesses involved in global payments. Currently, the Remittix PayFi infrastructure supports instant settlement in more than 30 fiat currencies with easy API integration for merchants worldwide. Trading at $0.0781, Remittix is still in its early stages, but the numbers are already sizable. The project has raised over $15.4 million in presale funding, selling more than 539 million tokens. This impressive performance shows investor confidence, driven by practical solutions, which is cementing its place in the high upside potential conversation. Analysts predict Remittix to reach $5 post-launch, especially if adoption continues at this pace. Early investors have already received more than 400% returns, with crypto pundits calling Remittix the “real-world” version Ripple promised but fell short of delivering. XRP price flashes bearish signals as investors search for higher upside alternatives XRP’s price performance continues to frustrate investors as it flirts with crucial support zones. Despite an earlier breakout in May, the token is now stuck in a narrow range, with the bullish trend weakening fast. Amid this adverse momentum, XRP’s on-chain data shows that a significant chunk of XRP’s circulating supply was acquired at or near its recent price peak. Glassnode data reports that over 70% of XRP’s realized market capitalization was accumulated between late 2024 and early 2025, when XRP rallied to nearly $3.40. Source: Glassnode This setup typically indicates a sharp sell-off for XRP as it shows serious profit-taking actions happening behind the scenes. Adding to these concerns, XRP appears to be breaking down from a bearish flag-like structure that formed after a classic cup-and-handle pattern. Bitcoin price enters accumulation phase for next markup After the Bitcoin price rallied to a new all-time high, it entered a consolidation phase. But unlike XRP, industrial experts believe this is a launchpad for BTC’s next major rally. Notably, the breakout above the upper trendline of its flag confirms the continuation of the prior bullish trend. This pattern indicates strong bullish control, often leading to a second leg up that is roughly equal in length to the flagpole. Source: TradingView Adding to the fire, open interest in BTC futures has also hit an all-time high of $76.06 billion. This record-breaking figure, accompanied by BTC’s soaring price action, reflects heightened market participation and optimism. Conclusion The clock’s already ticking for XRP investors as Bitcoin readies to enter its next bull run. Meanwhile, accumulating Remittix at $0.0781 is a no-brainer with its rare utility, priming it for an explosive run.

2025-06-01T20:01:09,"Latest Rumor Could Spark Massive Bitcoin and XRP Price Rally On Monday","A post from crypto commentator Bitcoin for Freedom (@BTC_for_Freedom) on X has triggered renewed speculation across digital asset markets. The account claimed that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will resign on Monday. The post concluded with a bold prediction of the future of digital assets. In a follow-up , he reaffirmed a $1 million Bitcoin price target for 2025. Powell’s Stance on Monetary Policy The rumor arrives at a pivotal time for U.S. monetary policy and crypto regulation. Powell, whose current term runs through May 2026, has historically resisted political pressure, including recent calls from President Trump to lower interest rates. His stance has often placed him at odds with pro-crypto advocates who argue that tight monetary policy stifles digital asset growth. While he does not see cryptocurrencies as a stability concern for the U.S., many in the crypto space do not appreciate his approach to inflation and interest rates. The Federal Reserve’s series of rate hikes from 2022 through 2024 contributed to a broader risk-averse sentiment, weighing on speculative assets including Bitcoin and XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Why Hasn’t Trump Fired Powell? Powell has maintained his commitment to central bank independence. He resisted speculation that he would yield to political shifts following Trump’s return to office. Despite the resignation of other key officials such as former SEC Chair Gary Gensler , Powell had previously indicated he would remain in his role and fulfill his term. He emphasized that the Federal Reserve’s independence “is a matter of law,” reinforcing the idea that he could not be removed without cause. This resistance led to speculation on ways Trump could remove him from his position without directly firing him. Potential Impact of Powell’s Resignation If the rumor of Powell’s resignation proves accurate, the implications for the crypto space could be substantial. Trump has already signaled a strong pro-crypto posture, most notably through the appointment of Paul Atkins , also known for his crypto-friendly views, as SEC Chair. A vacancy at the Fed would present the opportunity to appoint a central bank leader who favors lower interest rates and a more accommodative monetary policy. Such a shift could act as a powerful catalyst for digital assets. Investors often interpret lenient monetary policy as supportive of risk-friendly environments, where assets like XRP thrive. Trump’s administration has brought many positive changes. He initiated the conclusion of multiple crypto-related lawsuits, including the XRP lawsuit, which is nearing an official settlement . A new Chair with a softer stance on inflation and a willingness to tolerate increased liquidity could reinforce bullish momentum in the crypto market, giving XRP and other U.S.-based assets a major boost.

Analyst Justin Bennett tells his 115,000 followers on the social media platform X that BTC’s retracement will likely drive traders to believe that the bull market is over. According to the analyst, he expects Bitcoin to correct below $100,000 before it ignites a fresh leg up en route to $120,000. “This is the part where everyone gets super bearish, expecting a 2021-style macro top. It’s also probably where overly aggressive shorts get rekt. 1. The run-up isn’t even close to the same 2. The backdrop couldn’t be more different 3. I doubt they make it this easy.” Source: Justin Bennett/X In 2021, Bitcoin attempted but failed to take out resistance at $69,000 twice, triggering a bear market that sent BTC to bear market lows of $16,000. As for Bennett’s downside target for BTC, he thinks Bitcoin may bounce at $100,000 or $97,000. “BTC next leg down confirmed. 104,800 flips to key resistance. Support is $100,000. Same outlook for the last nine days.” Source: Justin Bennett/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $104,439. Looking at the broader crypto market, the analyst says he’s keeping an eye on the TOTAL chart, which tracks the total market cap of all digital assets. Bennett believes that TOTAL will correct and find support at $3.04 trillion, which aligns with his expected BTC pullback. “I could be wrong. I’m certainly not always right. However, I’m not sure how some are interpreting this as bullish. Things can change, but right now, sellers are in control.” Source: Justin Bennett/X A bearish TOTAL chart indicates that investors are unloading their crypto holdings.
