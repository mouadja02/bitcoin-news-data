2025-06-02T18:47:58,"Bitwise CIO Lauds Ripple’s XRP Loyal Base, Says XRP Not Competing with Bitcoin","Cryptocurrency markets often fixate on rivalries. Bitcoin vs. Ethereum . Solana vs. Hyperliquid. But at a Las Vegas conference last month, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan argued that XRP simply isn’t in Bitcoin’s ring. His remarks spurred fresh debate on how digital assets carve out unique niches—and why communities may matter as much as technology. On a Saturday at 1 p.m. Eastern Time, an estimated 1,000 people packed into the XRP Las Vegas venue. Investor conferences rarely attract such numbers during early afternoon weekend slots. But attendees filled every seat. Phones and tablets recorded the scene. Name badges swung across chests. Enthusiasm radiated in the air. Source: Hougan X Hougan delivered his keynote before that crowd. He posted photos afterward, showing rows of attendees glued to presentations. “It’s rare to see this turnout at 1 p.m. on a Saturday,” he said. “That speaks volumes about where XRP stands today.” Divergent Roles: Bitcoin vs. XRP Industry veterans often frame Bitcoin and XRP as adversaries. Yet Hougan challenged this binary. He stressed that each coin serves a distinct market: Bitcoin : Widely referred to as “digital gold,” Bitcoin commands a market capitalization of roughly $2.07 trillion as of late May 2025. Investors value its scarcity and decentralized security. XRP : Built for cross-border settlements, XRP’s daily transaction volume often outpaces many altcoins. As of May 2025, daily XRP transfers exceeded $30 billion. (Source: On-chain data providers). Hougan pointed out that thriving in different realms allows both cryptos to grow without cannibalizing each other. He said, “Bitcoin is reserved for store-of-value. XRP is optimized for fast settlements. One does not eat the other’s lunch.” XRP’s community has remained vocal and active, from developers to retail holders. Hougan praised this network as “the vital pillar of any crypto project.” He highlighted several facts: Developer Activity : Over 200 GitHub repositories related to XRP utilities and integrations remain active. Social Engagement : On platforms like X (Twitter) and Discord, XRP-specific channels host thousands of daily posts promoting real-world use cases—everything from remittance solutions to U.S. digital asset stockpile initiatives. This zeal once proved decisive in Ripple’s legal battle . In 2023, Judge Analisa Torres of the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York referenced affidavits from XRP holders compiled by attorney John Deaton. Those affidavits helped establish that Ripple’s programmatic token sales did not qualify as securities. After that ruling, major U.S. exchanges—including Kraken and Coinbase—re-listed XRP for trading. Both platforms cited renewed regulatory clarity as the driving factor. Ripple’s 2023 courtroom victory marked a turning point. Although Ripple still faces additional compliance hurdles, the decision lifted a cloud hanging over XRP’s trading status. Hougan underlined that community-driven legal support underscored XRP’s resilience. He added, “When holders step up, regulators and judges take note.” Since re-listing, XRP’s 24-hour trading volume has averaged $4 billion, a 35% increase from pre-ruling levels. Price volatility also declined. The token’s 30-day realized volatility dropped from 85% in June 2023 to 60% by March 2025. ETF Outlook Remains Bright In October 2024, Bitwise became the first asset manager to file a U.S. SEC application for an XRP spot ETF, signaling a growing institutional appetite for the asset class. Hougan has remained buoyant on the idea ever since. On live television in early 2025, he noted “strong demand” for an XRP ETF. As of June 2025, the SEC has yet to approve any spot XRP ETF . But industry insiders remain optimistic. Several proposals are in limbo, awaiting the regulator’s next steps. Hougan predicts a launch “later this year,” assuming no new regulatory setbacks. For comparison, the SEC approved the first Bitcoin spot ETF in January 2025, attracting $3.2 billion in assets within two weeks. Given the token’s utility-driven narrative and mobilized community, observers believe an XRP equivalent could draw $1 billion to $2 billion in its first month. With Bitwise’s XRP ETF filing still pending, market watchers will track SEC rulings closely. For now, XRP’s community is a testament to what organized advocacy can achieve. As Hougan put it, “Communities win hearts, minds, and sometimes, court cases.”",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitwise-cio-lauds-ripples-xrp-loyal-base-says-xrp-not-competing-with-bitcoin/,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare

2025-06-02T18:45:04,"Payments Giant Stripe Says Banks ‘Very Interested’ in Potentially Using Stablecoins: Report","The payment processing firm Stripe reportedly held early talks with banks regarding the potential for the financial firms to begin using stablecoin technology. Stablecoins are digital tokens designed to maintain a constant value against a fiat currency such as the US dollar. To date, there are about $243 billion worth of these assets in circulation, and c iting a statement from Stripe co-founder and president John Collison, Bloomberg reports that banks are eager to engage with stablecoins. Says Collison in an interview, “In the conversations we have with them, they’re very interested. This is not something that banks are just kind of brushing away or treating as a fad. Banks are very interested in how they should be integrated with stablecoins into their product offerings as well.” Collision says the talks happened after Stripe rolled out several stablecoin-related products in recent months, including a platform that gives fintechs the ability to quickly start their own stablecoin-card programs for customers. Last month, Stripe also announced that it is developing its stablecoin , which will be powered by the stablecoin infrastructure startup Bridge, a firm acquired by the payments giant last year. Stripe Crypto product manager Jennifer Lee says the company is ready to start testing the asset and invites companies outside the US, EU and the UK to reach out if they are interested in dollar access.

In a new interview with FOX Business, Dimon says that one of the biggest economic problems facing America is its increasing national debt, and that the government needs to tackle it. “[The US debt level is] a big deal. It is a real problem, but one day the bond market’s going to have a tough time. I don’t know if it’s six months or six years. I think we have to focus on it. But when you say focus on it, the real focus should be growth, pro-business, proper deregulation, permitting reform, getting rid of blue tape, getting skills in schools, get that growth going. That’s the best way. And then reform some of these programs everyone knows could be reformed properly. And I think some of the reform could take place. We’re not taking benefits out of poor people or sick people, old people. You’re just putting rules in place that make it more reasonable, less fraud, less waste, less abuse. I think all those things need to be done, and then we can conquer that problem.” Commenting on the weak US bond market, Dimon warns that if the country’s economy weakens due to its debt and other factors, investors may continue to flee US dollar assets, causing more bond market turmoil. The CEO doesn’t give a timeline, but says “it will happen.” “What the public has understand is that something like $30 trillion of securities trades every day. These are investors around the world. Foreigners own $35 trillion of American securities. They have another $30 trillion private investments in the United States, or something like that in the United States. People vote with their feet, and they’re going to be looking at the country, the rule of law, the inflation rates, the central bank policies, what they want to hedge and what they don’t want to hedge. Those [bond] rates aren’t set by central banks. They can affect them. They can twist them. They can do things to make you feel more comfortable, which they should do. But if people decide that the US dollar is not the place to be you could see credit spreads gap out and that would be quite a problem. We had that during COVID. The Fed properly stepped in then… It will happen again.

2025-06-02T18:29:59,"Elon Musk Announces Launch Of XChat — But Tech Experts Question Its Supposed ‘Bitcoin-Style’ Encryption","Eccentric tech billionaire Elon Musk, the owner of the X (formerly Twitter) social media platform, announced on Sunday the launch of a brand-new messaging feature called XChat. The feature touts capabilities such as encrypted conversations, vanishing messages, file transfers, and audio and video calls. However, Musk’s statement that XChat is built on a programming language called Rust with Bitcoin-style encryption confounded Bitcoiners. The comment sparked a flurry of replies from Bitcoin enthusiasts and cryptography experts, who expressed doubts about what exactly it meant. Experts Are Skeptical Of “Bitcoin-Style” Encryption JAN3 and Pixelmatic CEO Samson Mow noted that “Bitcoin isn’t encrypted,” while Bitcoin core developer Luke Dashjr also chimed in, stating “Bitcoin doesn’t even use encryption” and that using the Rust language was “a bad idea for security reasons.” Bitcoin employs elliptic curve cryptography and SHA-256 hashing for transaction validation and key generation. However, transactions conducted on the Bitcoin blockchain are not encrypted but are signed. Everything you do is broadcast publicly on the blockchain, as all data shared between Bitcoin nodes is unencrypted. “Seriously, what is Bitcoin-style encryption? Bitcoin primarily uses signatures, not encryption,” Ian Miers, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Maryland, said on X . “This is like saying, we decided to run our rocket on water, since NASA uses Hydrogen and Oxygen. Musk’s announcement follows a week of revived interest in his various firms after he confirmed his exit from the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.). DOGE, named in part as a nod to Musk’s favored crypto Dogecoin, was created to reduce federal waste. Bitcoin, the industry’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, traded lower near $104,159 at publication time, having declined by over 5% over the past week, CoinGecko data shows . “Needless to say, “Bitcoin style” and “Rust” are not descriptions of an encryption scheme, nor are they strong indicators of security for a messaging app. Also, unless encrypted DMs are only in app, odds are they aren’t just in Rust,” Miers concluded . It’s worth mentioning that Musk’s EV maker Tesla purchased $1.5 billion worth of BTC in February 2021, calling it a reserve-management strategy. Although the company offloaded the majority of its holdings in Q2 2022, it still holds approximately 11,900 BTC on its balance sheet.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/elon-musk-announces-launch-of-xchat-but-tech-experts-question-its-supposed-bitcoin-style-encryption/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|MINING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Elon Musk",cryptocompare
2025-06-02T18:18:29,"Best crypto to buy as start of altcoin season favours low cap coins","Altcoin season has officially arrived, sparking fresh excitement across the crypto markets as both large and low-cap tokens begin to rally. The momentum has been building gradually, but over the last few days, key indicators have confirmed that the altcoin market is entering a bullish phase. Monero (XMR), Maker (MKR), and Sonic (S) are among the large-cap altcoins that have taken the lead, showing strong price performances and growing investor interest. Low-cap altcoins are the biggest gainers While these top-tier coins are gaining traction, the most dramatic surges are occurring in the low-cap segment, where returns can be significantly higher for early entrants. Build on BNB (BOB), WEMIX, Layer 3 (L3), and Maple Finance (SYRUP) have emerged as some of the biggest gainers as trading volumes and percentage gains skyrocket. BOB has jumped over 266% in just 24 hours, attracting fresh eyes to the BNB ecosystem and proving that even niche tokens can lead the way during altcoin rallies. WEMIX is following closely, climbing nearly 59% as trading activity surged, supported by growing interest in its gaming and NFT infrastructure. Layer 3, known for its Web3 integration tools, also delivered a solid 34.3% gain, while SYRUP added to the trend with a 15.8% rise, signalling that decentralised finance (DeFi) remains a key narrative. Today’s top gainers |Source: Coingecko The rise of these low-cap altcoins often signals the start of a more aggressive alt season, where traders rotate profits from Bitcoin and Ethereum into riskier, high-reward tokens. Which is the best crypto to buy as the altcoin season starts? For new investors entering the market, this moment presents a strategic opportunity to discover emerging coins before they receive mainstream attention. The environment is particularly favourable for upcoming projects like Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP), which is currently finalising its presale and preparing for its first exchange listing. Earlier today, the Bitcoin Pepe team announced that its listing date has been pushed to June 17, giving investors a short but crucial window to accumulate tokens at the presale price. Bitcoin Pepe @BitcoinPepe_ · Follow Presale AnnouncementWe’ve been working closely with exchanges, but as these things go, they need a bit more time to finalise. Therefore, our listing announcement is now set for June 17th, with more info coming 🗓️To thank our early supporters, we’re giving a 30% bonus to 6:00 PM · Jun 2, 2025 48 Reply Copy link Read 14 replies To reward early adopters, the project is now offering a 30% bonus to everyone who has already participated in the presale, further strengthening confidence and demand. Notably, Bitcoin Pepe positions itself as the world’s first meme-based Bitcoin Layer-2 project, aiming to bring Solana-like speed and cost-efficiency to the Bitcoin ecosystem. It introduces a new PEP-20 token standard, allowing memecoins to launch on Bitcoin, a concept that merges the power of BTC with the viral potential of meme culture. This innovative narrative has already attracted massive interest, with the presale raising over $13.6 million out of a $14.08 million target. With the final tokens now selling at $0.0396, and just 15 days left before the CEX and DEX listings go live, momentum is building fast. Bitcoin Pepe’s unique approach to combining Bitcoin’s longevity with the explosiveness of memes has resonated with both retail traders and influencers across the Web3 space. In addition, the team behind BPEP includes crypto veterans like Tafcir, formerly of Ubisoft’s Web3 division, and Allan, a seasoned community builder with deep roots in decentralised culture. As the altcoin season unfolds, Bitcoin Pepe’s timing couldn’t be better, placing it in a position to benefit from renewed interest in novel, early-stage crypto assets. Presale buyers could not only lock in lower prices but also receive bonus allocations, putting them in an advantageous position before potential listing surges. For investors looking to enter the market during altcoin season, BPEP offers both narrative appeal and practical utility, making it more than just another meme token. Moreover, the project’s roadmap includes a Layer-2 bridge, a native DEX, and community staking, providing strong foundations for long-term value. Given the market’s shift toward high-upside, low-cap assets, Bitcoin Pepe stands out as a compelling option ahead of its anticipated public debut.

2025-06-02T18:03:06,"Is the crypto bull run still alive? A Bitcoin price technical analysis deep dive","Bitcoin’s recent pullback has sparked debate: is the bullish trend still intact, or is a deeper correction on the horizon? With price currently trading above a key channel low and the 200-day moving average, this zone may represent the foundation for the next leg higher—toward $116,000. After tapping a new all-time high around $111,900, Bitcoin ( BTC ) entered a corrective phase, pulling back toward high-timeframe support at $104,300. This zone marks the bottom boundary of the bullish channel that has contained price action for months. Rejections from the channel high often lead to retests of the channel low, which is precisely what has occurred. Price is now hovering just above the 200-day moving average, a level closely watched by institutional traders and a historically reliable marker of macro support. Key technical points Channel Low Support at $104,300 : Acts as the structural base for the current bullish trend; holding this level is crucial for any continuation to the upside. 200-Day Moving Average: Bitcoin is currently trading above this dynamic support, reinforcing bullish bias if it continues to hold. Trendline Resistance Above: A descending trendline acts as minor resistance. Breaking this would signify a structural shift and the start of a new bullish leg. Bullish Market Structure Since $74,000: Price continues to print higher highs and higher lows. As long as this pattern holds, the trend remains intact. “Power of Three” Accumulation Structure: Price appears to be forming an accumulation-manipulation-distribution phase. Reclaiming the channel confirms the bullish reversal. Failed Auction Possibility: If price reclaims the channel after manipulation, a failed auction scenario is confirmed, greatly increasing the odds of a move to $116,000. BTCUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView From a market context perspective, the rejection from the channel high and subsequent retracement toward the channel low are technically expected. Price inside a well-defined channel often oscillates between its boundaries before breaking in the dominant direction. The rejection at $111,900 aligned with the channel’s resistance, while the current stalling at $104,300 has already produced a strong bullish candle, signaling that buyers are defending this level. This type of impulsive bounce from support suggests a short-term sentiment shift. Structurally, Bitcoin is trading back within its established bullish channel, implying the previous breakout may have been an early expansion or overextension. The current retest can be seen as a healthy reset before continuation. You might also like: Crypto Fight Night ONCHAIN ignites the ring at Philippine Blockchain Week 2025 Of particular importance is the 200-day moving average now sitting just below the price. Historically, this level has acted as long-term support during major bull trends. A close and consolidation above it typically signals that the broader uptrend remains in place. As long as BTC holds this level, it projects long-term strength. BTCUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView Beyond surface-level technicals, there is growing interest in a possible “Power of Three” pattern. This accumulation framework includes three phases: Accumulation – where price consolidates in a range Manipulation – where price breaks below key support, shaking out weak hands Distribution – a powerful rally following the fakeout In this context, the drop below the channel low may represent manipulation. A reclaim of the channel would confirm a failed auction, a classic deviation followed by strong continuation. If this pattern holds, the move to $116,000 could unfold rapidly, aligning with Fibonacci extensions and the measured move from the channel range. BTCUSDT (6H) Chart, Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s broader structure remains technically bullish. Since forming a major swing low at $74,000, the asset has consistently printed higher highs and higher lows. The current correction fits within that structure and could represent a new higher low. Only a clean break below $104,300 on high volume would challenge this thesis. You might also like: Blockchain firm BTCS Inc. buys 1,000 ETH via Crypto.com Volume remains telling. While it spiked during the drop, it has stayed elevated during the defense of $104,300, evidence that demand is present at support. Sustained buying pressure at this level could set the stage for the next upward rotation. What to expect in the coming price action As long as Bitcoin holds above $104,300 and remains above the 200-day moving average, the bullish market structure is intact. A reclaim of the channel followed by a break of trendline resistance would confirm the next bullish phase. Expect a rotation toward $111,900, followed by a measured extension toward $116,000. If this plays out, Bitcoin would validate the Power of Three structure and confirm that the recent breakdown was a deviation, fueling a failed auction rally toward new highs.

2025-06-02T18:00:45,"Ethereum Signals Uptrend With Key Candlestick Pattern, Could A Rally Follow?","In the past few days, Ethereum has been struggling below the $2,600 price level after the general crypto market took a bearish hit, halting its recent upward trend. While ETH’s price has faced notable bearish movements, there is still a possibility that the altcoin could rally in the upcoming weeks as a key bullish pattern emerges. A Possible Rebound Emerging For Ethereum Ethereum’s upward performance has weakened due to a bearish shift in the crypto market, causing many major digital assets to retrace. Despite this price action, Crypto Bullet, a technical expert and investor, has outlined a setup that hints at a possible rebound toward higher levels in the short term. Following his analyses of the 1-month chart, Crypto Bullet highlighted that ETH closed the month of May on a bullish note. In addition to the monthly close, the altcoin has formed a beautiful Morning Star Candlestick formation, suggesting growing upside momentum. A Morning Star Candlestick formation is a technical pattern that suggests a potential shift from a bearish trend to a bullish trend, making it a reversal pattern. When the market is in a dire downward trend, the morning star candlestick pattern is regarded as a sign of hope for a positive run . The emergence of this key chart setup suggests that the altcoin may be gearing up for another upswing, despite the mixed sentiment in the broader crypto market. With technical indicators hinting at a shift toward the upside trajectory, the anticipated rally might reignite a bull market phase for Ethereum. According to the crypto analyst, ETH is currently facing tough resistance as prices struggle to regain upward strength. However, the altcoin recently broke past the $2,500 price level, which Crypto Bullet considers a key resistance range. Prior to the breakout , the expert predicted that a notable rally could follow, pushing ETH to the $3,300 mark in the upcoming weeks. Since Ethereum has slightly surpassed $2,500 at the time of writing, this implies that the anticipated journey to $3,300 and beyond might have begun. Major ETH Investors Are Returning To The Market Despite facing bearish performance, investors’ sentiment toward ETH has remained strong, particularly on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. On-chain expert and author Darkfost reported that Ethereum whales are back on the crypto exchange. Darkfost identified the shift after examining the ETH Average Order Size on Binance, a metric that provides a real-time picture of Ethereum’s sentiment and momentum on the platform. This is measured by combining important market data on spot and futures activity, cumulative volumes, and a comparison of moving averages. ETH whale orders on Binance have been rising since May 19, representing a very encouraging signal and conviction among large investors. The last time this indicator was illuminated in this manner was in December 2023, just before ETH’s strong rise from $2,200 to $4,000. While the indicator has lit up, Darkfost highlighted that whales are not always attempting to catch the exact bottom; rather, they often position themselves early when a macro trend starts to show indications of strength.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-signals-uptrend/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Ethereum|Altcoin|binance|Crypto Bullet|Darkfost|ETH|ETH Average Order Size on Binance|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|Ethereum Whales|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Morning Star Candlestick Formation",cryptocompare

Golden ratio and 100 EMA near $105,800 cap early gains. Breakout above $107,000 may confirm bullish continuation.

Click here to find out more » By Sholanke Dele Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) began Monday’s European session by staging a mild rebound at $105,500, after last week’s 5.5% drop from $109,000 to $103,200. That retracement pulled the price below the 0.786 Fibonacci level of the rally that ended at the all-time high of $112,000, signalling profit-taking into month-end. Despite the late-May weakness, Bitcoin still closed the month with an 11% gain, building on April’s 14% rise. That two-month strength suggests the broader bullish structure is still valid, but recent developments now place heavy emphasis on reclaiming critical resistance zones to sustain upward momentum. BTC price dynamics (April - May 2025). Source: TradingView The price rebounded from $103,200 over the weekend, reclaiming the 0.786 Fibonacci level. But today’s Asian session selloff found resistance near $105,800, a level that coincides with both the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, commonly known as the golden ratio, and the 100 EMA on the 4-hour chart. This confluence marks the most immediate barrier for bulls. Bitcoin rally depends on clearing $106,000 and invalidating the EMA death cross As the European session opens, Bitcoin attempts another retest of this resistance zone. But the upside remains constrained by the bearish crossover structure on the 4-hour chart, where the 20 EMA crossed below both the 50 and 100 EMA following last week’s slide. Although the 20 EMA has been reclaimed at $105,350, the 50 EMA at $106,000 is the next hurdle before further upside can be considered. Momentum also reflects indecision. The RSI holds around 50, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. This supports the idea of a key inflection point, where the next move will depend on whether price breaks above the golden ratio or slips back toward support. If bulls fail to reclaim the $106,000 to $107,000 resistance band, downside could revisit the previous week’s low at $103,200. A break above $107,000, however, would likely confirm a broader bullish continuation for early June. Bitcoin price dropped to $104,750 and tested the key Fibonacci zone before rebounding . A death cross on the 4-hour chart increased the risk of further decline.

2025-06-02T17:53:57,"Crypto prices today: Bitcoin at risk below $104K, XMR, KAIA lead daily gains","Bitcoin extended its downtrend from May 27, with bulls attempting to hold the line at the critical $104,000 support level, a threshold analysts view as pivotal in averting a deeper market correction. With risk appetite fading, the total crypto market cap dropped by over 2 percent to $3.36 trillion, revisiting early May levels. The sentiment shift was reflected in the Crypto Fear and Greed Index, which dropped to 56, signaling a move from greed to a more cautious, neutral stance. Altcoins traded largely flat, showing limited momentum as Bitcoin dominance continued to weigh on broader market activity. While a few names posted modest gains, the majority hovered near previous levels or recorded slight declines. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin’s latest drop comes amid growing macroeconomic concerns, most notably stalled trade negotiations between the United States and China. The breakdown in talks has reignited global risk aversion, prompting investors to shift away from speculative assets, such as cryptocurrencies. Geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe added to the cautious mood, as renewed concerns over the Russia-Ukraine conflict resurfaced in market discussions. Bitcoin slipped below $104,000 at the June 2 Wall Street open, coinciding with broader market unease around the potential collapse of ongoing peace efforts. Analysts at the Kobeissi Letter noted that markets were effectively pricing out expectations of a resolution, following months of behind-the-scenes diplomacy. While former President Donald Trump had reportedly been working on a peace framework, the lack of formal communication from US officials has fueled speculation and uncertainty over the conflict’s trajectory. This risk-off sentiment was reflected in the derivatives market, where over $156 million in crypto futures positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours. According to Coinglass data, 73,552 traders were wiped out during the sell-off, with long positions accounting for the bulk of the damage at $76.39 million. Bitcoin and Ethereum bore the brunt of the derivatives washout, with ETH alone seeing $3.08 million in long liquidations. The imbalance between long and short liquidations suggests that traders were overly optimistic on a rebound, only to be caught off guard by the sharp downside move. Adding further pressure, institutional flows have also turned negative. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded back-to-back outflows over the past two trading sessions, with a combined drawdown of nearly $975 million. This ended a 10-day streak of inflows, raising concerns over waning institutional conviction at current price levels. With sentiment retreating and both derivatives and spot flows turning bearish, the market appears to be entering a consolidation phase. Will Bitcoin crash? Most analysts are not calling for an outright crash, but rather expect Bitcoin to enter a consolidation phase as it digests recent volatility. Trading firm QCP Capital noted that despite the recent swings, Bitcoin is still holding above 102,000 dollars, pointing to underlying support in that range. According to their latest market bulletin, volatility has compressed and risk reversals are stabilising, which often suggests quieter price action ahead. In the absence of fresh catalysts, QCP expects Bitcoin to trade within a broad range of 100,000 to 110,000 dollars over the near term. Others like Daan Crypto Trades are watching short-term patterns closely. Based on prior monthly trends, the trader believes early June moves may fade once a local reversal forms. If that scenario plays out, it could guide trading direction for the rest of the month, although the broader trend remains unclear. Daan Crypto Trades @DaanCrypto · Follow $BTC My plan for the month ahead 👇ith eyes on this strong monthly statistic, I am looking for either of these two scenarios. Drawings are a rough estimate, obviously the moves can go lower or higher, it’s more about the idea than the precise levels for now.I think there’s a 1:32 AM · Jun 2, 2025 346 Reply Copy link Read 74 replies Historical data also adds some caution. June has been a bearish month for Bitcoin in four of the past six years, and as such, seasonal weakness could persist if macro pressures stay in focus. Traders are also watching key economic data from the US this week, particularly unemployment figures and any signals from the Federal Reserve. All eyes will be on Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s opening remarks due later today. The strength of the labour market is being reassessed after recent data hinted at softening, raising questions about the Fed’s ability to keep rates elevated. Although inflation appears to be cooling, as seen in the latest PCE print, the Fed has so far held firm. President Trump’s recent meeting with Powell didn’t move market expectations either, with CME FedWatch data showing traders still do not anticipate a rate cut before September. That said, some analysts see a potential tailwind for Bitcoin in the weakening US dollar. The Dollar Index has dropped back below 99, reversing its earlier gains. According to experts at Mosaic Asset Management, if dollar weakness deepens, it could signal broader concerns over the US fiscal outlook, a setup that could benefit assets like gold and Bitcoin over the longer term. At the moment, some Bitcoin technicals point to a deeper correction. The cryptocurrency has broken below the lower boundary of a bear flag pattern at 104,800 dollars on the four-hour chart, confirming a bearish continuation setup. This breakdown opens the door to a potential move toward the pattern’s projected target of 97,690 dollars. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView. Supporting the bearish case, BTC’s Relative Strength Index remains weak, with the RSI hovering around 44. This suggests that selling pressure is still dominant, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to further downside unless a strong reversal catalyst emerges. Nevertheless, not all market watchers are leaning bearish, with some viewing the latest pullback as a necessary reset within a broader uptrend. According to Merlijn The Trader, a golden cross has recently formed on Bitcoin’s daily chart, mirroring a similar setup seen late last year. At the time, a 10 percent correction was followed by a sharp 63 percent rally. If that pattern repeats, Merlijn suggests Bitcoin could be primed for a breakout move exceeding 60 percent in the coming weeks.

The leading gainer among the top 99 altcoins was Monero (XMR), which managed to secure double-digit gains of 11.3% as of press time, while Kaia (KAIA) and Sky (SKY) posted gains of 7.5% and 4.3%, respectively. Source: CoinMarketCap Monero’s price surge appears linked to increased demand after hackers reportedly used over $335 million in stolen Bitcoin to acquire and move funds through its network, likely contributing to the sharp appreciation. KAIA saw a brief rally following the announcement of a 2 million dollar grant program, which seemed to have reignited interest among traders and long-term holders.

Criminals are using delivery trucks to access secure areas without being challenged. High-value crypto holders face rising physical extortion risks globally. On May 31, Paris prosecutors charged 25 suspects in a string of crypto-linked abductions, including a foiled kidnapping attempt targeting Paymium CEO Pierre Noizat’s family. The cases, marked by severed fingers and €7M ransom demands, reveal a brutal new front in crypto crime. At least three high-profile abduction plots have been disrupted since May, all targeting French crypto executives or their relatives. Prosecutors warn that the tactics, which include physical mutilation, reflect an escalating threat to digital asset holders.

In a bold daylight attack near a school, the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the CEO of crypto firm Paymium, were nearly kidnapped by assailants posing as delivery drivers. The attackers used a van marked with the branding of French courier delivery service Chronopost to blend in.

Prosecutors also pointed to other failed crypto kidnapping plots, including a prior attempt on the same targets the day before. This also included a disrupted scheme near Nantes just last week. So far, 18 suspects have been placed in pre-trial detention. Three have requested to delay their court hearings, and four others are under judicial supervision, which requires them to follow strict rules while awaiting trial. France has witnessed a disturbing rise in such incidents, and recent headlines reflect the scope of the problem. On May 1, the father of a young online poker player, who had earned millions through crypto trading and live streaming, was kidnapped in Paris’s 14th arrondissement. Four attackers disguised as UPS delivery workers used a stolen van to abduct the victim. A ransom of €5–€7 million was demanded via wire transfer. To coerce the son into transferring the requested sum, they severed one of the victim’s fingers and recorded the act. The victim was later rescued in Palaiseau during a coordinated police operation. Another similar case was reported in January. David Balland, co-founder of the crypto hardware company Ledger, and his wife were kidnapped in the Cher region of France. The attackers reportedly severed one of Balland’s fingers and recorded the brutal act. They then sent the video to his business partner, Eric Larchevêque, along with a ransom demand. According to Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau, the kidnappers requested payment in cryptocurrency and managed to collect part of the ransom.

Global Hotspots Where Crypto Kidnappings Are Surging France may be in the spotlight, but it’s far from the only country facing this trend. Crypto kidnappings are on the rise worldwide. From South America to North America, Europe to Asia, criminals target digital asset holders with alarming boldness. In the U.S., two NYPD officers were placed on modified duty last week .

Meanwhile, the U.S. charged six men in February linked to the October 2024 kidnapping of four Chicago residents. The victims were forced to transfer $15 million in crypto . Just a month before that, a UK court sentenced seven gang members to lengthy prison terms for kidnapping and torturing a crypto investor . The operation was an attempt to extort digital assets. One of the most high-profile cases in Canada involved WonderFi CEO Dean Skurka. He was kidnapped during rush hour in Toronto in November 2024 and released after reportedly paying a $1 million ransom . Crypto abductions have cracked the safety net of digital finance. They show that the risks of holding valuable digital assets extend beyond phishing emails and password theft. They can reach into homes and families, threatening personal safety. Governments are intensifying their fight through cross-border investigations, tighter regulations, and advanced technology tracking. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How are criminals identifying crypto targets? Some scour social media for targets. Others leverage data from hacked cryptocurrency exchanges, such as the latest Coinbase data dump on the darknet. Why aren’t crypto abductions prosecuted as terrorism?

Outlines His Plans!","Cardano (ADA), one of the largest altcoins in the cryptocurrency market, experienced a major attack after Donald Trump's presidential victory. While ADA continues to make a name for itself with its 100 percent rise, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson made a bold prediction for Bitcoin (BTC). Hoskinson predicted at the recent Bitcoin Conference that Bitcoin could reach somewhere between $250,000 and $500,000 in the coming years. Hoskinson also shared Cardano’s latest expectations for the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, including plans to integrate XRP into its growing ecosystem. Noting that Bitcoin is a store of value from the strength of DeFi, he said the shift towards BTC is accelerating. Reiterating three long-standing and defining principles for Bitcoin, Hoskinson listed them as “all transactions must use only Bitcoin, fees must be paid in BTC, and returns must come only from Bitcoin.” Hoskinson said that these rules help protect Bitcoin’s identity but make DeFi integration extremely difficult, and that’s where Cardano comes in. At this point, Hoskinson stated that they have developed the technology to enable DeFi integration and connect BTC and DeFi without changing the essence and identity of Bitcoin. Charles Hoskinson also confirmed that Cardano is working to incorporate XRP into the DeFi ecosystem and wants to leverage XRP’s strong reputation for cross-border payments. Finally, Hoskinson added that this integration could help create a seamless, scalable multi-chain ecosystem where Bitcoin, XRP, and Cardano can work together, increasing financial access and inclusivity around the world. *This is not investment advice.

Reveals the Secret of Its Success!","New statements came from Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, who stands out with his strong predictions about Bitcoin (BTC) and the cryptocurrency market. This time he talked about one of the largest altcoins, Ripple – XRP. On this point, Matt Hougan recently praised XRP and emphasized the strength of its community. Hougan stated that he believes XRP’s success can primarily be attributed to the strength of the community behind it. According to Hougan, who stated that he gave a keynote speech at the XRP Las Vegas event from his X account, the conference venue was filled with 1,000 people at 1:00 pm ET on Saturday. That number was impressive, according to Hougan, as early Saturday afternoon events tend to draw fewer people, but the XRP community showed its strength and filled the venue. The Bitwise CIO was asked about the key takeaways from the conference, to which Hougan responded by comparing Bitcoin and XRP. At this point, the Bitwise CIO stated that the XRP community is increasingly accepting that Bitcoin and XRP are not direct competitors, and that both XRP and Bitcoin serve different markets. “I think the XRP world has embraced the idea that BTC and XRP serve different markets and that BTC’s development will not disrupt XRP’s goals. But mostly, it's just the power of the community. That's a huge piece of success in crypto, and the community in XRP is strong.” Bitwise CIO previously predicted that if XRP manages to gain a significant foothold in sectors like payments and tokenization, its price could rise to around $30 after a decade. *This is not investment advice.

Meanwhile, a small leveraged ETF tied to the stock, Defiance Daily Target 2x Short MSTR ETF (SMST), has plummeted to a record low of $29, marking an 82% decline from its January levels. The ETF holds over $42 million in assets. SMST vs MSTR vs Bitcoin | Source: SeekingAlpha This sharp underperformance is due to SMST’s design: it seeks -2x the daily percentage change of Strategy stock (MSTR). In other words, it is structured to rise when Strategy stock falls—and to decline when the stock is in an uptrend. You might also like: Strategy stock price moves into a correction: will it rebound? For example, on Monday, June 2, MSTR stock rose 1.30%, while SMST dropped 2.50%. Other leveraged MSTR ETFs have also lagged behind its stock this year. The Defiance Daily Target 2x Long MSTR ETF has dropped by 4.5% while the T-Rex 2X Long MSTR Daily Target ETF has also dropped by 6.4% this year. These funds have struggled largely because Strategy stock has declined more than 12% from its highest level this year, despite remaining up year-to-date. Inverse leveraged ETFs like SMST are risky Historically, leveraged inverse ETFs underperform their benchmark assets. For example, the ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ ETF or SQQQ has crashed by 97% in the last five years. In contrast, the ProShares UltraPro QQQ or TQQQ has jumped by 242% in the same period. The SMST ETF will likely continue falling since analysts anticipate that Bitcoin ( BTC ) will do well in the long term. Ark Invest sees Bitcoin jumping to $2.4 million by 2030, while BlackRock expects that it will hit $700,000. If these estimates are correct, it means that Strategy stock will jump in the long term because the company holds almost 600,000 Bitcoins, a number that is increasing weekly. The other risk for SMST ETF is that it is highly expensive, with an expense ratio of 1.29%. In contrast, popular ETFs like the Vanguard S&P 500 and iShares S&P 500 charge just 0.03%. This means that a $10,000 invested in SMST will charge an annual fee of $129, while the S&P 500 funds charge just $3 a year.

2025-06-02T17:30:52,"Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse says Bitcoin is not the enemy","CEO of Ripple Labs, Brad Garlinghouse, surprised the entire XRP community and much of the wider crypto community when he said, “Bitcoin is not the enemy,” at the XRP Las Vegas 2025 conference. Many people did not expect Garlinghouse to support Bitcoin and its community because he strongly criticized its flaws for years. Because he changed his opinion, people are now questioning whether he is genuine or if his moves are just for political and industry support, especially now when cryptocurrency is under pressure from governments and traditional banks. While some believe he wants to unify the crypto world to push back against tight regulations and a banking system that still controls most global finance, others worry that he might be giving in to Bitcoin maximalists. Whatever the reason, Garlinghouse’s new message is bold, and it could reshape how people view Ripple and XRP in the larger crypto conversation. Ripple and Bitcoin communities have long clashed Ripple and Bitcoin supporters have disagreed on what makes a good cryptocurrency for over a decade. The XRP community has long said Bitcoin still depends on proof-of-work mining that consumes large amounts of electricity and handles fewer transactions per second, while their token solves real-world problems by being faster, more scalable, and far more energy-efficient. Garlinghouse described Bitcoin’s mining model as outdated and harmful to the environment, and he has repeatedly said XRP is better suited for building a real, usable financial system on the blockchain. On the other hand, Bitcoin maximalists claim XRP is centralized, controlled by Ripple Labs, and serves banks instead of empowering individuals. They call the token a “banker coin” and say it goes against the original vision of crypto, which was meant to remove middlemen, not work with them. Maxis also points to the long legal battle with the SEC as proof that XRP isn’t a trustworthy or decentralized cryptocurrency. Ripple’s peace gift to Bitcoin supporters stirs mixed reactions Brad Garlinghouse donated the Skull of Satoshi to the Bitcoin community days before the XRP Las Vegas 2025 conference began. Some people praised the move as a way of acknowledging past conflicts while signaling a new willingness to collaborate. At the same time, some Bitcoin maximalists saw it as a sign that Ripple and its supporters finally recognized Bitcoin’s dominance. Others said the peace offering showed that XRP needed Bitcoin more to succeed in cryptocurrency. In one post, a user said, “Ripple tried to replace Bitcoin for 10 years. Now they’re offering us skulls like it’s ancient Rome.” Another viral tweet said, “When you lose the war, at least bring a gift.” However, XRP loyalists had mixed reactions because some interpreted the move as a sign that Ripple was rising above petty arguments and positioning itself as a unifier in the industry. In contrast, others worried that the gesture made Ripple look weak. Garlinghouse makes a risky but strategic move Brad Garlinghouse’s new tone toward Bitcoin could be a carefully calculated strategy that allows him to build stronger alliances as the US government and financial regulators scrutinize digital assets. He may also want to prepare Ripple for upcoming discussions with financial institutions and governments that want to integrate blockchain technology on condition that they see signs of stability and professionalism. However, critics argue that Garlinghouse might be extending a hand that won’t be accepted, making his gestures look like weakness instead of strength. The biggest risk is within Ripple because the brand has always positioned XRP as an efficient, scalable, and low-cost alternative to Bitcoin, and its supporters stood proudly against what they saw as Bitcoin’s flaws. Garlinghouse’s latest message muddies the line between rival and partner, and a growing number of XRP fans feel like the company is gradually retreating from the principles that made it unique, which muddles and frustrates its base. Supporters who once believed XRP would overtake or replace Bitcoin may now wonder if the goal has changed and Ripple could lose its loyal following by trying to appeal to both sides.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/did-ripple-just-surrender-to-bitcoin-maxis/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MINING|REGULATION|XRP","OP-ED|Bitcoin|Ripple",cryptocompare
2025-06-02T17:30:16,"Bitcoin Vs. M2: Abra CEO Sees $130,000 As Liquidity Floods In","Bill Barhydt, the founder and chief executive of crypto-banking platform Abra, set Crypto-X alight over the weekend by reposting a collage of global M2-versus-Bitcoin charts first popularised by macro investor Raoul Pal and researcher Julien Bittel. “I’ve seen over a dozen posts with different versions of the global liquidity M2 vs Bitcoin price chart – I’ve attached several here. Credit @RaoulGMI and his colleague @BittelJulien for discovering the trend,” he wrote. “Most of these charts predict a dip over the coming days to around $100 k and then a move to new ATH of $130 k in August/September … Or this could all be horseshit. Whatever.” Will Bitcoin Follow M2? Expanding on the macro backdrop, Barhydt argued that “global liquidity needs to rise significantly in the coming months. Bitcoin remains the mother of all liquidity (re: debasement) sponges.” He framed the asset’s reflexivity in stark terms: as fiat supply grows, Bitcoin absorbs the monetary excess, and the resulting gains “will most likely spill over into other L1 platforms and then ultimately speculative alts – the proverbial alt season.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Tipped For $340,000 Target If This Support Level Holds – Details Even so, he cautioned traders against complacency. “Watch your leverage, touch grass and please please be civil,” Barhydt advised, noting that the anticipated pull-back could be a gentle pause or a swift capitulation toward $95,000 before any summer rally materialises. When a follower fretted that the model might already be overcrowded, Barhydt dismissed the idea that positioning had reached critical mass: “I’ve thought about that but we’re talking about trillions of dollars and billions of people. There might be thousands of people focused on this but not more. Even then retail writ large isn’t focused on crypto right now.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Warning: Bull Trap Or $270,000 Rocket? Analyst Exposes What’s Coming A second critic complained that the liquidity data “is not collected on a timeframe that would predict daily moves.” Barhydt concurred, replying: “I completely agree. Hence the ‘whatever’ reference. It’s macro directional on a weekly scale at best. But in that regard it’s been a very good tool.” The liquidity-first thesis still has heavyweight backers. Pal recently told Real Vision subscribers that “liquidity is the single most important driver of all asset prices,” estimating that rising world-money supply accounts for up to 90% of Bitcoin price action, while Bittel’s latest update pegs global M2 near a record $111 trillion – a level he says leaves Bitcoin “still going higher.” Whether those macro tailwinds propel Bitcoin to the $130,000 target or prove, in Barhydt’s own words, to be “horseshit” will depend on how briskly central banks resume balance-sheet expansion and how aggressively traders deploy leverage in the weeks ahead. For now, Barhydt’s call serves as both roadmap and reality check: the next swing could be explosive, but the model is only as good as the liquidity it tracks. At press time, BTC traded at $104,625.

2025-06-02T17:28:05,"Bitcoin Pepe announces new listing date and 30% bonus for early buyers","Bitcoin Pepe, the viral meme coin that’s been making waves in the crypto community, has officially announced a new centralized exchange (CEX) listing date: June 17, 2025. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the project’s official account stated that while they’ve been “working closely with exchanges,” the process has required “a bit more time to finalise.” To show appreciation for early adopters, Bitcoin Pepe is now offering a 30% bonus to all current holders who participated in the presale phase. Bitcoin Pepe @BitcoinPepe_ · Follow Presale AnnouncementWe’ve been working closely with exchanges, but as these things go, they need a bit more time to finalise. Therefore, our listing announcement is now set for June 17th, with more info coming 🗓️To thank our early supporters, we’re giving a 30% bonus to 8:00 PM · Jun 2, 2025 48 Reply Copy link Read 14 replies With the listing just two weeks away, excitement is building among investors who see the coin as one of 2025’s most promising meme tokens. The announcement follows a highly successful presale, during which Bitcoin Pepe raised over $13 million, signaling strong early investor confidence in the project’s potential. Why CEX Listings matter for Bitcoin Pepe A centralized exchange (CEX) listing is a major milestone for any crypto project, and for Bitcoin Pepe, it could be the spark that launches the coin into the mainstream. CEX listings provide increased liquidity, visibility, and accessibility, opening the door to a wider audience beyond the DeFi-savvy crowd. Most retail investors still rely on centralized platforms to purchase crypto, meaning that listing on a top-tier exchange could significantly boost trading volume and market awareness. The June 17 listing could mark the moment Bitcoin Pepe transitions from meme coin cult favorite to broader market contender. What makes Bitcoin Pepe an attractive pick for 2025 While meme coins are often associated with hype over substance, Bitcoin Pepe is trying to stand out by building a strong community and capitalizing on broader market tailwinds. Its branding, merging the internet’s beloved Pepe character with the gravitas of Bitcoin, has struck a chord with a new generation of crypto investors looking for high-upside plays with viral potential. Add to that the fact that the crypto market is heating up again. With the Federal Reserve expected to resume cutting interest rates in the second half of 2025, and Bitcoin itself pushing toward new highs after months of consolidation, the macro environment is turning bullish. If Bitcoin rallies, it tends to lift the entire market, and meme coins, often the most speculative of all assets, typically see explosive gains during these phases. What could drive future demand for Bitcoin Pepe Bitcoin Pepe isn’t just another meme coin – it’s the world’s only Bitcoin meme ICO, aiming to merge viral internet culture with serious blockchain innovation. The project is building Solana on Bitcoin, introducing a Meme Layer-2 that features instant transactions, ultra-low fees, and a new PEP-20 token standard to support scalable, fun applications on the Bitcoin network – all of which could further improve its demand and lead to a higher price target moving forward.

2025-06-02T17:25:15,"Why Bitcoin’s next short-term target is $120,000","Although Bitcoin ( BTC ) is consolidating, a trading expert projects that the asset is poised to break out toward $120,000. In this case, prominent online analyst TradingShot pointed out that Bitcoin nearly touched its four-hour 200-period moving average ( MA ) on Saturday, a critical support level since April 16. In a June 2 TradingView post , TradingShot noted that after testing this level, BTC immediately rebounded. While the bullish reaction has been moderate since price action remains capped below the four-hour 50-period MA, there are compelling reasons to expect an imminent breakout. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Specifically, the formation of a blue Arc pattern over the past three weeks mirrors the price behavior seen during previous peaks and pullbacks since Bitcoin’s early April bottom. These Arc patterns have historically signaled significant upward momentum once the price breaks above resistance. Adding to the bullish case, the four-hour Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) dipped into oversold territory for the first time since April 7. This condition suggests Bitcoin may be primed for a sharp reversal as buyers capitalize on discounted prices. Bitcoin’s next price target Even the weakest rally of this long-term bullish leg has seen gains of at least 16.06%. If the 4H MA200 continues to hold and Bitcoin breaks above the 4H MA50, TradingShot anticipates a minimum short-term rise of 16.06%, pushing BTC to approximately $120,000. As reported by Finbold, TradingShot previously suggested that historical price movements indicate that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by late 2025. Meanwhile, pseudonymous analyst El_crypto_prof highlighted a familiar chart setup in an X post : a final small dip before a powerful surge. With BTC hovering above $104,000, he identified $102,000 as a prime entry point and $97,000 as the critical floor for this bullish scenario to unfold. Bitcoin price analysis chart.

Bitcoin one-week price chart. Source: Finbold Despite the consolidation, Bitcoin’s technical structure remains bullish, with the price significantly above its 50-day simple moving average ($98,885) and 200-day SMA ($86,995). This alignment suggests a strong upward trend and sustained bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the 14-day RSI sits at 54.83, indicating neutral conditions.

2025-06-02T17:16:36,"Strategy Doubles Down on Crypto with $75M Purchase of 705 Bitcoin","Strategy, led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, announced on Monday that the firm has purchased an additional 705 Bitcoin for approximately $75.1 million between May 26 and 30, reinforcing the company’s ongoing commitment to the cryptocurrency. Strategy has acquired 705 BTC for ~$75.1 million at ~$106,495 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 16.9% YTD 2025. As of 6/1/2025, we hodl 580,955 $BTC acquired for ~$40.68 billion at ~$70,023 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF https://t.co/K4tex3qHrN — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 2, 2025 This purchase was funded by proceeds from the company’s active at-the-market (ATM) offerings of its preferred stock classes, STRK and STRF. The purchase period spanned from May 26 to June 1, 2025, and marks another milestone in the company’s long-running Bitcoin accumulation strategy. The firm now holds a total of 580,955 BTC acquired for an aggregate purchase price of roughly $40.68 billion, representing an average purchase price of $70,023 per bitcoin. This latest buy reflects Strategy’s ongoing commitment to its Bitcoin-centric corporate treasury strategy, where excess capital, including proceeds from equity offerings, is consistently redeployed into the cryptocurrency. With this move, Strategy also disclosed a bitcoin yield of 16.9% year-to-date, reinforcing its position as the largest corporate holder of BTC globally. The timing of this acquisition, at a higher average price compared to its long-term cost basis, suggests that Strategy views Bitcoin’s recent rally as a sign of longer-term strength rather than a peak. ATM Programs Fuel Expansion During the same period, Strategy said it has made use of its ATM equity programs to raise funds for both operational and investment purposes. Between May 26 and June 1, the company raised a total of $74.6 million across its ATM programs: $36.2 million from the sale of 353,511 STRK shares and $38.4 million from the sale of 374,968 STRF shares. These preferred stock instruments, each carrying attractive dividend yields of 8.00% and 10.00% respectively, were established earlier this year and have already shown strong traction in the market. As of June 1, there remains substantial capacity within these programs for future issuance—$20.68 billion for STRK and $2.05 billion for STRF—indicating Strategy’s intent to continue leveraging these instruments for growth and BTC accumulation. The company also declared quarterly cash dividends on both series of preferred shares, with STRK shareholders receiving $2.00 per share and STRF shareholders receiving approximately $2.64 per share. These payments are scheduled for June 30, 2025, to shareholders of record as of June 15. The dividend on the STRF shares includes an accrual from the issuance date of March 25, further underlining the firm’s attention to maintaining shareholder value alongside its bitcoin-centric strategy. K33 Says Strategy Slows Bitcoin Buys as MSTR Premium Shrinks K33 Research reports that Strategy appears to be easing its pace of Bitcoin acquisitions. In its latest filing, Strategy revealed it bought 4,020 BTC between May 19 and May 25 for $427.1 million, using proceeds from its ongoing $21 billion at-the-market (ATM) offering. However, capital raised from the program has slowed. Only $348.7 million was deployed during that week—down from $705.7 million the week prior and $1.31 billion in early May. K33 Head of Research Vetle Lunde attributes the deceleration to two key factors: a declining premium for MSTR shares relative to the firm’s Bitcoin holdings, and intensifying competition among corporations entering the Bitcoin treasury space. “The pace of ATM utilization is notably slower than the first round,” Lunde noted. Between early November and mid-December, Strategy raised an average of $2.13 billion weekly. In contrast, recent averages have dropped to $788 million.

2025-06-02T17:08:53,"Latest Development on Saudi Prince’s $100 Million Investment in XRP","In a major development shaking the crypto landscape, a Saudi prince , Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Saud, has reportedly executed a landmark $100 million investment in XRP. This move, initially reported by Times Tabloid , has drawn global attention as it signals deepening institutional and sovereign interest in the digital asset space. According to the latest official announcement by VivoPower International PLC on its X account, the prince’s acquisition will happen through a strategic partnership with BitGo, one of the world’s leading digital asset custody providers. This collaboration ensures that the prince’s ambitious entry into XRP is securely handled, leveraging BitGo’s world-class infrastructure and treasury solutions. BitGo @BitGo Enters Strategic Partnership with VivoPower $VVPR to Facilitate its Initial US$100 Million XRP Acquisition for Treasury Strategy 𝗥𝗘𝗔𝗗 https://t.co/wi4KosTMH0 pic.twitter.com/Tmm3OArx5E — VivoPower (@Vivo_Power) June 2, 2025 BitGo’s Pivotal Role in Facilitating the Investment BitGo’s reputation in the digital asset space cannot be overstated. As a global leader in digital asset custody, BitGo brings multi-signature security, regulatory compliance, and advanced treasury management capabilities, which are crucial for institutional investors. The platform processes more than $1 billion in transactions monthly and is particularly geared toward helping institutional clients integrate crypto into traditional financial operations securely. By partnering with VivoPower, BitGo has effectively provided the operational backbone to facilitate the prince’s $100 million XRP acquisition. This collaboration marks a vital moment not only for the involved parties but also for the broader crypto market, demonstrating how institutional-grade custodianship can enable sovereign and high-net-worth investors to navigate the crypto industry. VivoPower’s Expanding Crypto-Focused Treasury Strategy VivoPower has been steadily advancing its digital asset strategy over the past year. Through its subsidiary, Tembo e-LV, the company has already made headlines by announcing that it would accept payments in Bitcoin (BTC), XRP, and Dogecoin (DOGE) for its electric vehicles. This progressive step reflects VivoPower’s belief in digital currencies as both a medium of exchange and a treasury reserve asset. In its public statement, VivoPower emphasized that the prince’s XRP acquisition aligns with its broader treasury strategy : holding portions of reserves in digital assets while applying prudent market assessments and risk controls. This approach is designed to enhance the company’s financial flexibility and capture the potential upside in the fast-growing crypto sector. Ripple’s Growing Global Footprint The prince’s investment in XRP arrives at a time when Ripple, the company behind XRP, is rapidly expanding its global presence. Ripple has established numerous partnerships with financial institutions, payment providers, and fintech hubs worldwide to push the adoption of blockchain-based solutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Notably, Ripple recently announced a collaboration with South Korea’s BDACS to strengthen institutional custody services for XRP and RLUSD, Ripple’s dollar-backed stablecoin. These global partnerships continue to strengthen XRP’s standing as a bridge currency for cross-border transactions, a role that significantly differentiates it from many other cryptocurrencies in the market. Institutional and Sovereign Confidence in XRP While retail investors have long been engaged with XRP, the entrance of sovereign players such as a Saudi royal into the ecosystem is a powerful endorsement. This investment signals growing confidence in XRP’s long-term utility, particularly for cross-border payments and liquidity management. Moreover, it suggests that sovereign wealth, family offices, and institutional treasuries are increasingly looking to diversify into digital assets, recognizing them not only as speculative instruments but as essential components of modern financial portfolios. A Landmark Moment for the Crypto Market The BitGo-VivoPower partnership facilitating this $100 million XRP acquisition by a Saudi prince marks a watershed moment in the institutionalization of cryptocurrencies. It demonstrates how far the industry has matured, with sophisticated infrastructure now available to support even the most demanding investors. As digital assets continue to embed themselves into global financial frameworks, such high-profile investments are expected to accelerate, signaling a new era where cryptocurrencies like XRP are no longer fringe instruments but foundational components of modern treasury strategies.

The bill aims to implement tax reforms, reduce government spending and advance elements of President Trump’s “America First” agenda. Says George Saravelos, head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, “We see this legislation as creating the scope for the US administration to transform a trade war into a capital war if it so wishes, a development that is highly relevant in the context of today’s court decision constraining President Trump on trade policy… It is not unreasonable for the market to conclude that if the President is constrained on using trade policy, taxing foreign capital could be a new means of leverage.” Saravelos says that the provision attempts to use taxation on foreign investors as leverage to advance American economic priorities, and only has to meet a low bar before being enforced. Elias Haddad, a strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., also told Bloomberg that the bill would “deter foreign investment.” “A foreign tax provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is alarming… If the bill as presently written takes effect, it would deter foreign investment in US assets at a time when the country faces increasing reliance on foreign capital to finance its ballooning debt.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-02T16:45:46,"Expert Says $10,000 XRP Holders Will Soon Tell This Millionaire Story","Edoardo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy, recently presented a compelling perspective on what he believes will shape the success narratives of XRP investors in the years ahead. In a post shared on X, Farina stated that early holders of XRP who made significant personal and financial sacrifices will one day be regarded as visionaries, even though the mainstream may attribute their eventual success to mere chance. Farina remarked that future observers might hear stories such as, “Years ago, I sold my car to buy 10,000 XRP,” and assume these investors were simply fortunate. However, he emphasized that this overlooks the effort and conviction required to invest in XRP at a time when confidence in its potential was not widespread. According to Farina, these individuals will not have achieved their success through luck, but rather through belief and the willingness to take risks. One day, those who got rich from XRP will say, ‘Years ago, I sold my car to buy 10,000 XRP.’ And the world will call them lucky, without understanding the risk it took. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) May 28, 2025 The Importance of Early Commitment Despite strong fundamentals and notable developments in adoption, XRP has remained below its all-time high of $3.84, recorded over seven years ago. Currently trading near $2, the asset continues to face resistance even as other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, advance to new all-time highs. This has tested the patience of long-term holders, particularly those who anticipated far higher returns based on projections of $10, $100, or even $1,000 per XRP. Farina suggests that accumulating 10,000 XRP—an investment that could have cost approximately $5,000 just months ago—might one day lead to significant wealth. If XRP were to reach $100 per unit , holders at this level would achieve millionaire status. Farina has encouraged the crypto community to aim for this threshold, warning that current prices may soon be out of reach. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Support for the Narrative Farina’s message received support from others within the XRP community who also view early investments as a matter of conviction rather than luck. One X user, Fiora, responded, saying , “On the surface, it seems to be “lucky and rich”, but in fact it is the result of early believers taking risks that ordinary people cannot bear.” This comment aligns with Farina’s position, reinforcing the idea that many early investors made bold choices that most people would have been unwilling to take. Counterpoints from the Community However, not all reactions were supportive. A user identified as Sun Shine questioned the optimism surrounding XRP’s long-term potential. In their comment, they stated the coin has not been earning for the longest time, drawing attention to the asset’s prolonged underperformance in comparison to its peers. This criticism highlights the broader frustration felt by some holders who expected higher returns by now. Farina’s belief that statements like “I took the risk and bought 10,000 XRP” will become part of future millionaire success stories underlines a larger debate within the crypto space. While some see XRP as a long-term investment built on vision and endurance, others remain skeptical due to its stagnant price action. Nonetheless, Farina and his supporters continue to assert that risk-takers who committed early will eventually be recognized not for their luck, but for their foresight and persistence.

2025-06-02T16:34:42,"Hackers Drain Force Bridge in $3M Crypto Heist","Force Bridge, a Nervos Network-based cross-chain platform, had suffered a significant crypto heist. Announced on June 2, the Web3 security company Cyvers said the hackers stole over $3 million of crypto assets. This attack comes just days after Magickbase, a key Nervos partner, announced plans to shut down the bridge due to low activity and high maintenance costs. Hackers Struck Force Bridge Before Shutdown Plans According to Cyvers’ X post, the hackers drained over $3 million across multiple digital assets. The hackers stole 257,800 USDT, 539.09 Ethereum, worth about $1.35 million, and 898,300 USDC. The bad actors reportedly siphoned 60,400 DAI and 0.79 wrapped Bitcoin, worth around $83,000. After the theft, Cyber revealed that the stolen funds were quickly converted into Ethereum. The criminals also used Tornado Cash, a crypto-mixing tool known for laundering stolen funds . The system hides the funds’ transactions, making tracking difficult. Magickbase, the Singapore-based infrastructure firm that helps manage Force Bridge, quickly stepped in. The team paused the bridge to prevent further damage and confirmed an ongoing investigation in an X post. This incident came just two days after Magickbase announced that Force Bridge would be shut down. The reason was low user activity and high costs of keeping the bridge running. The shutdown plan was shared in a notice published on May 31. This decision may have signaled a vulnerability window to attackers. What Is Force Bridge? Nervos Network launched in 2019 and created Force Bridge, a tool for moving crypto between different blockchains using smart contracts and token wrapping. This innovation makes trading and sharing easier between blockchains. A group called Magickbase helps build and manage the Force Bridge. They support developers and make sure the system works well. Nevertheless, security experts have warned that bridges are susceptible to attacks. These bridges use smart contracts to lock tokens on one chain and issue new ones on another. If these contracts have weaknesses, hackers can manipulate the system and siphon large amounts of crypto. The Bigger Problem with DeFi Crypto Heist Force Bridge is not the only bridge that has been hacked. Many decentralized finance (DeFi) bridges connecting different blockchains have suffered major attacks in recent years. In 2022, hackers stole $600 million from the Ronin Bridge , which disrupted its operations at the time, and $323 million from the Wormhole Bridge. In 2024, Orbit Chain similarly lost over $81 million. Just like in the Force Bridge case, the attackers used Tornado Cash to hide their stolen crypto. In April 2025, hackers failed to break into LayerZero’s Stargate bridge. This shows that security remains a big problem for DeFi bridges.

A filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under number 001-42210 shows the firm wants to use this purchase to support its growth outside Hong Kong. Reitar Logtech says the move updates its treasury strategy and helps it handle changing financial conditions. By adding Bitcoin to its reserves, the company aims to back further development in its logistics technology platform. The SEC filing makes clear that digital currency will serve both as a store of value and as a way to react to shifts in global markets. Kin Chung Chan, Director, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer of Reitar Logtech, signed the document submitted to the SEC. The company states that investing in Bitcoin is intended specifically to strengthen its logistics technology business. “This strategic treasury diversification initiative underscores our commitment to maintaining a strong financial foundation while scaling our global logistics technology platform,” said Reitar Logtech Chairman and CEO John Chan, according to the filing. He added, “By exploring Bitcoin treasury allocation, we aim to fortify our financial position while aligning with digital transformation trends in the supply chain industry. This potential initiative provides enhanced flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions and expand into new markets.” Reitar announces BTC acquisition while Strategy buys again On the same day, Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) announced it purchased 705 BTC at a cost of $75.1 million. Strategy now holds 580,955 BTC, with a total value of over $60 billion. Despite these moves, Wall Street remains skeptical. This week, Trump Media said it would raise $2.5 billion to buy Bitcoin, and GameStop announced a $500 million Bitcoin investment. A newcomer, Twenty One, backed by Tether, SoftBank, and Strike’s Jack Mallers, launched with plans to hold 42,000 BTC from the start, which would make it the third-largest corporate Bitcoin holder worldwide. Shares of Trump Media fell more than 20% after its announcement, while GameStop’s stock dropped 17%. Investors appear unconvinced that these Bitcoin-focused strategies will pay off in the near term.

Through this “BTC Program,” Reitar seeks to acquire up to 15,000 BTC from a consortium of institutional and high-net-worth investors in exchange for company shares, based on average BTC and stock market prices. The initiative is designed to strengthen Reitar’s balance sheet and provide flexibility for acquisitions and digital infrastructure investment, especially across high-growth Asian markets. Management believes this strategy will help reduce exposure to traditional asset risks while supporting the company’s long-term vision for global logistics innovation.

2025-06-02T15:56:35,"Magickbase and Cyvers sound the alarm about Nervos breach","In what seems to be a security breach, the Nervos Network’s cross-chain bridge, Force Bridge, has been reportedly taken over by a suspicious account, which has so far resulted in the theft of approximately $3 million in digital assets. The breach is the latest incident where the vulnerabilities of a blockchain’s interoperability solutions have been exploited, raising concerns about the security of cross-chain protocols. Magickbase and Cyvers sound the alarm about Nervos breach One of the first alerts came from Magickbase, a developer of Nervos-integrated desktop wallet software. In a post shared on X (formerly Twitter), the team said it had picked up on unusual activity on Force Bridge and immediately shut down related services to protect users. “We’ve detected abnormal activity on #ForceBridge and have paused the service as a precaution. Our team is investigating,” Magickbase wrote, assuring its users that more information would be shared as it becomes available. Shortly after the post, blockchain security firm Cyvers Alerts published a more detailed breakdown of the breach. According to their analysis, a suspicious address has taken over the bridge and launched unauthorized movement of assets out of the Nervos network. 🚨ALERT🚨Our system has detected multiple suspicious transactions involving @NervosNetwork . A suspicious address appears to have taken control over the bridge, stealing ~$3M in assets: 257.8K $USDT 539.09 $ETH 898.3K $USDC 60.4K $DAI 0.79 $WBTC All funds were swapped to $ETH and… pic.twitter.com/jA3EZVpTeN — 🚨 Cyvers Alerts 🚨 (@CyversAlerts) June 2, 2025 So far, the only communication from Nervos itself has been a repost of Magickbase’s initial warning. According to Cyvers, the attacker converted the stolen tokens into Ethereum and began funneling the funds through Tornado Cash, a crypto “mixer” that scrambles transaction trails to make the origin and destination nearly impossible to trace. This kind of laundering is all too familiar, and Tornado Cash has increasingly been used as a go-to tool for cybercriminals looking to clean stolen funds. And once the money hits Tornado, recovery becomes a long shot. A bigger problem in the blockchain world Unfortunately, this incident is just the latest in a growing pattern. Cross-chain bridges have become some of the most attacked pieces of infrastructure in the crypto ecosystem. High-profile hacks like those on the Ronin and Binance bridges have made headlines; other exploits, like those involving Orbit Chain, Socket, and ALEX bridge, have also cost users millions of dollars over the past year. Force Bridge was supposed to be part of Nervos Network’s broader vision of secure, scalable blockchain interoperability. The network has been widely praised in the past for its hybrid design, combining Bitcoin’s UTXO model with smart contract functionality. In a 2024 Messari report , Nervos CKB was even called a potential “game-changer” for blockchain programmability. But as this breach demonstrates, even technically sophisticated networks are only as secure as their most exposed component. This has also brought to light the ongoing debate surrounding the use of tools like Tornado Cash . The argument that it offers legitimate privacy benefits for users may not continue to hold water with its continuous use by bad actors to launder large amounts of stolen funds and complicate tracking efforts.

Nervos Network's Force Bridge Hacked: Over $3 Million in Crypto Stolen According to security researchers, the attackers seized approximately 257,800 USDT, 539.09 ETH (about $1.35 million), 898,300 USDC, 60,400 DAI, and 0.79 wrapped Bitcoin worth approximately $83,000. Most of the stolen assets were converted to Ethereum and transferred through the Tornado Cash mixer, which is often used to cover up the tracks. Following the attack, infrastructure company Magickbase, which makes significant contributions to the Nervos ecosystem, announced that it has stopped its bridge service and launched an investigation. The company made a statement on June 2 on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) stating, “Our team is investigating the incident.” Singapore-based Magickbase is known as one of the main partners providing infrastructure support to Nervos Network’s developers and users. The company recently announced plans to terminate its Force Bridge service as of May 31, citing low user activity and high maintenance costs. Nervos Network, whose mainnet was launched in 2019, aims to increase cross-chain interoperability and create an integrated blockchain ecosystem with tools such as Force Bridge. DeFi bridges like Force Bridge work with smart contracts and “token wrapping” technologies that allow for the transfer of assets and data between isolated blockchains, but these systems are frequently subject to hacker attacks due to their complex structures and security vulnerabilities. Notable past examples include the Ronin Bridge attack in 2022, where $600 million was stolen, and the Wormhole attack, where $323 million was stolen. Such incidents once again reveal how fragile DeFi bridges can be in terms of security. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Hacking Incidents Never End in the Crypto Industry!
