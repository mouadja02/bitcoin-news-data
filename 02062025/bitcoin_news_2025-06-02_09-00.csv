2025-06-02T06:36:44,"Metaplanet adds 1,088 BTC to Bitcoin holdings, boosting the total to 8,888 BTC","Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has invested more of its company funds into buying 1,088 Bitcoin, bringing its total BTC holdings even closer to 9,000 BTC. According to the company notice , Metaplanet just spent around $117.7 million to purchase more BTC ( BTC ) for its holdings. On June 2, the Tokyo-based investment firm bought 1,088 BTC at an average price of $108,209. With its recent purchase, the company dubbed by many as the Japanese “Strategy” now holds 8,888 BTC which is equal to around $851 million according to market prices at the time of its latest purchase. According to Bitcoin Treasuries’ database , Metaplanet’s recent purchase has made it the 10th largest corporate BTC holder on the leaderboard. However, it still has a long way to go if it wants to catch up to Michael Saylor’s Strategy. Strategy currently occupies the top spot, with 580,250 BTC in total holdings. At press time, Bitcoin has gone up by 0.4% in the past 24 hours. It is currently trading hands at $104,848, noticeably around $4,600 lower than the purchase price Metaplanet opted for. In fact, its 24 hour peak still stood at $105,804.

Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Yields Alongside the recent BTC purchase, Metaplanet provided updates on its BTC Yield metric. BTC Yield is used to calculate the period-over-period percentage ratio between the company’s Bitcoin Holdings and its fully diluted shares outstanding. Throughout 2025, the company’s BTC holdings generated the largest yield percentage during the first quarter of 2025, which ran from January 1 to March 31. During this period, the company saw its BTC Yield amount 95.6%. However, this marked a large departure from its previous BTC Yield at the end of 2024 which jumped as high as 309.8%. On the other hand, the BTC Yield recorded from April 1 to June 2 amounted to only 66.3%. Most recently, the company issued its largest set of 0% ordinary bonds to the venture capital EVO FUND. The bonds were worth a combined value of $50 million. According to the notice, the funds generated from the bond issuances would be used to buy more Bitcoin.

2025-06-02T06:35:50,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Shows Oversold Status, Whales Bet $560,000 On Viral Altcoin","The post Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Shows Oversold Status, Whales Bet $560,000 On Viral Altcoin appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News SHIB’s price is stuck, and investors are moving on. Sell-offs have picked up, and weak market momentum is shaking confidence. As SHIB fades, whales are shifting to new plays. Unilabs is catching that wave. On-chain data shows over $500,000 of its $1.7 million presale came from SHIB holders. That’s a clear signal: seasoned investors want more than hype. Unilabs delivers real utility and passive income, something Shiba Inu coin can’t offer. It’s becoming the smarter choice for those seeking stronger, long-term gains. SHIB’s Price Faces Major Resistance as Whales Go On Selling Spree SHIB’s price keeps sliding, dropping for four days straight and hitting $0.00001238 – its lowest since April 22. That’s a 30% drop from its May high, pushing Shiba Inu coin into a bear market. Bitcoin’s fall from $111,900 to $103,000 hasn’t helped, dragging down overall sentiment. Whales are also pulling back. Large wallets have cut holdings from 743 trillion to 723 trillion Shiba Inu coin since January. This steady sell-off shows falling confidence and adds pressure on SHIB’s price. Source | TradingView Shibarium, the Shiba Inu coin’s layer-2 network, is also underperforming. It holds just $2.92 million in total value, far behind rivals like Unichain with over $600 million. Weak adoption raises doubts about the memecoin’s long-term use, impacting SHIB’s price. The burn rate is fading, too. The biggest burn this week hit just 18 million Shiba Inu coins – a far cry from past billion-token events. With burns slowing, one of the key bullish drivers for SHIB’s price is losing strength. Technicals offer no relief. SHIB’s price broke below its wedge pattern and the 50-day moving average. If buyers don’t step in soon, analysts see a drop to $0.00001033 as likely. Right now, the trend remains bearish for Shiba Inu coin. How is Unilabs Reshaping the Asset Management Industry? Unilabs is changing how asset management works. It fixes a big problem even top firms like Vanguard and BlackRock face – human error. These mistakes cost billions. Unilabs uses AI to cut that risk and make smarter, faster decisions.

2025-06-02T06:34:55,"Bitcoin ETFs ended six-week inflow streak over macro jitters and BTC slump","Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a notable shift in investor sentiment last week, as uncertainty surrounding Donald Trump’s trade policies and profit-taking led to a reversal in inflow trends. According to SoSoValue data , the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. recorded $157.4 million in outflows over the past week from May 27-30, ending a six-week inflow streak that drew in over $9 billion into the funds. Among the funds hit hardest was ARK 21Shares’ ARKB, which saw $281.9 million pulled by investors. Fidelity’s FBTC wasn’t far behind, recording outflows of $198.8 million. Grayscale’s GBTC and Bitwise’s BITB also took a hit, losing $134.4 million and $104.3 million, respectively. Other funds like Invesco’s BTCO, Franklin Templeton’s EZBC, and VanEck’s HODL recorded a combined $30.3 million in redemptions. Still, it wasn’t entirely bearish across the board. BlackRock’s IBIT managed to offset a significant portion of the outflows with $584.6 million in inflows, indicating that some investors still viewed the pullback as a buying opportunity. Grayscale’s mini BTC fund and Valkyrie’s BRRR also saw modest inflows, helping soften the overall blow. Despite last week’s redemptions, May still ended on a bullish note for Bitcoin ETFs overall. Net inflows totaled around $5.23 billion for the month, up over 75% compared to April’s figure. For context, February and March had seen net outflows of $3.56 billion and $767.91 million, respectively. The rebound in May shows just how much appetite investors still have for BTC, even with short-term market jitters. You might also like: Bitcoin exchange reserves hit an all-time low — is a volatility spike coming? Investor demand for Bitcoin ETFs took a hit last week, partly because traders started locking in profits after BTC’s rally its new all-time high earlier in May. With June historically being a bearish month for Bitcoin in four of the past six years, many likely chose to take some gains off the table ahead of a potential seasonal dip. At the same time, fresh worries on the macro front didn’t help. The ongoing drama around Trump’s trade tariffs resurfaced after two U.S. courts issued conflicting rulings. One ruling declared the tariffs illegal , while the other allowed them to stay in place during the appeal process, which could drag on all the way to the Supreme Court. That kind of uncertainty is keeping some investors on edge. Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has slipped about 4.3% over the past week, briefly dipping to $103,950 on June 2 before bouncing back a bit to around $105,000. Even with the drop, BTC is still just 6.1% off its all-time high of $111,814 from earlier last month. “This pullback is healthy, not signaling outright bearishness but more of a pause and consolidation,” Himanshu Maradiya, founder and chairman of CIFDAQ, told crypto.news. “Overall, this is not a risk-on environment, but also not one to fear. It’s a time for discipline: capital preservation, sharp focus, and readiness to seize opportunities as they arise.” Read more: Top 4 reasons why XRP price may surge 50% in June",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/bitcoin-etfs-ended-six-week-inflow-streak-over-macro-jitters-and-btc-slump/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","News|BlackRock|Cryptocurrency|DeFi",cryptocompare
2025-06-02T06:21:20,"France brings charges against 25 in crypto kidnapping conspiracy","French prosecutors have formally charged 25 people, some as young as 16, in connection with a series of attempted kidnappings targeting crypto industry figures and their families. According to local media, the charges follow a string of high-profile abduction plots that have shaken France’s growing digital asset community. The suspects, aged between 16 and 23, are believed to be linked to coordinated efforts to kidnap individuals with ties to cryptocurrency wealth, often using stolen vehicles and fake courier branding to carry out the attacks. Central to the latest indictments is the widely reported May 13 kidnapping attempt in Paris, where masked assailants attacked the daughter and grandson of Paymium CEO Pierre Noizat. The attack took place in the 11th arrondissement in broad daylight and was caught on video, which later circulated online. All three victims sustained minor injuries and were treated at a hospital. Authorities say this incident was part of a wider conspiracy involving other unsuccessful attempts, including a similar plot the day prior and a separate operation near Nantes shortly thereafter. Of the 25 charged, 18 are now in pre-trial detention, four are under judicial supervision, and three have requested delayed hearings. You might also like: Crypto-linked kidnapping cases in France lead to arrests of over 12, including minors The suspects reportedly come from a variety of backgrounds, with many born in the Paris area and others from places including Senegal, Angola, Russia, and Châtellerault. Defence lawyers have characterized some of the accused as vulnerable youths drawn into criminal activity with promises of quick money, unaware of the severity of the crimes. The investigation gained momentum following mass arrests on 27 May, when French police conducted coordinated raids across Île-de-France and Loire-Atlantique. The operations were led by the Brigade de Répression du Banditisme, France’s specialized anti-gang unit, and focused on dismantling a network allegedly behind multiple crypto-related abduction schemes. French officials believe these incidents may be connected to a criminal organization that recruits operatives via social media to carry out high-risk abductions. Investigators say those arrested so far appear to be foot soldiers and logistics handlers, with the masterminds still at large. As previously reported by crypto.news, French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau met with digital asset industry stakeholders in mid-May to discuss security measures.

2025-06-02T06:09:14,"Czech Justice Minister Resigns Over Bitcoin Scandal","This led to an investigation and political fallout just months after the country passed a major pro-crypto law aligned with the EU’s MiCA framework. Meanwhile, Bitcoin maximalist Max Keiser questioned the staying power of new Bitcoin treasury adopters, like Strive and Trump Media. He believes they lack the discipline shown by Strategy's Michael Saylor during bear markets, and warned of potential unsustainable equity premiums. Across the globe, the IMF flagged Pakistan’s decision to allocate 2,000 megawatts for Bitcoin mining and AI data centers, which raised concerns about energy policy and regulatory oversight amid ongoing IMF loan negotiations. Bitcoin Donation Forces Czech Minister to Step Down Czech Justice Minister Pavel Blazek resigned after widespread criticism over his acceptance and subsequent sale of Bitcoin that was donated by a convicted drug trafficker. The controversy began on May 28 when the Justice Ministry announced via social media that it raised close to 1 billion Czech koruna (or approximately $45 million) by auctioning off close to 500 Bitcoin. These funds were intended to support justice system improvements, including digitization, prison reform, and staff housing. Post from the Justice Ministry However, local media soon revealed that the Bitcoin originated from Tomas Jirikovsky, a criminal that was convicted in 2017 for his role in operating Sheep Marketplace, a dark web platform used for trading illegal goods. In March, Jirikovsky’s lawyer approached Blazek with an offer to donate one-third of the Bitcoin he retained after his release from prison in 2021. Blazek accepted the offer without investigating the source of the cryptocurrency, and claimed during a press conference that he had no means to verify the origin and believed the gesture was motivated by a desire to repent. Pavel Blazek The revelation sparked public outcry and drew a lot of criticism from opposition leaders, who accused Blazek of gross negligence. The Czech police also launched an investigation into the origin of the donated Bitcoin. During his trial, authorities already suspected that Jirikovsky’s crypto holdings were connected to another dark web platform, Nucleus, though Jirikovsky insisted the Bitcoin was legally obtained. This allowed him to keep a portion after serving his sentence. Due to the growing political pressure and with national elections on the horizon, Prime Minister Petr Fiala distanced himself from Blazek, which ultimately prompted the minister’s resignation on May 30. Blazek held firm that he committed no wrongdoing but stated he stepped down to avoid damaging the government’s reputation. The scandal happened against the backdrop of a new pro-crypto legislative shift in Czechia. On Feb. 6, President Petr Pavel signed a landmark law regulating digital assets, which aligned the country’s crypto framework with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. The legislation aims to simplify taxation and encourage innovation in the digital asset sector. Max Keiser Questions Bitcoin Treasury Boom Bitcoin also stirred some doubt from maximalist Max Keiser . He voiced skepticism over the durability of newly emerging Bitcoin treasury companies, and questioned whether they can actually maintain the same level of financial discipline as Michael Saylor’s Strategy during a sustained bear market. In a May 30 post on X , Keiser argued that while Saylor famously continued to accumulate Bitcoin through downturns without selling, these newer firms have yet to be tested under similar conditions. He warned that it is “foolish” to assume these so-called Strategy clones will show comparable conviction, and suggested instead that “Strategy is the Bitcoin of BTC treasury plays.” Saylor’s company serves as a model for crypto-aligned treasury management, and attracted a lot of investor interest from both crypto-native and traditional finance circles. Its stock surged to an all-time high of around $543 on Nov. 21, which ended up pushing a wave of companies to mimic its Bitcoin-centric reserve strategy in hopes of achieving similar financial performance and share price appreciation. Bitcoin holdings (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.net ) Analysts now warn that this proliferation of Bitcoin treasury adopters could result in corporations collectively controlling more than half of Bitcoin’s total supply. Among the most recent entrants, asset management firm Strive announced its Bitcoin treasury transition on May 7. Just weeks later, the Trump Media and Technology Group, which is a media firm partially owned by US President Donald Trump, disclosed a massive $2.5 billion capital raise to buy Bitcoin. Another Strategy-inspired company, Metaplanet, saw its shares trade at an implied Bitcoin premium of $600,000, meaning investors are paying nearly six times more for exposure through equity markets than they would by purchasing Bitcoin directly. This growing premium trend is causing concern among market analysts, who warn that such elevated valuations may be unsustainable if market sentiment shifts or if Bitcoin enters a prolonged correction. IMF Flags Pakistan’s Bitcoin Mining Power Plan Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is concerned about Pakistan’s recent decision to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence data centers. The move is part of Pakistan’s broader digital asset strategy, and was made at a time when the country is engaged in sensitive negotiations for an extended financial assistance program with the IMF. According to local news outlet Samaa, the IMF was not consulted prior to the announcement and is now seeking urgent clarification from Pakistan’s Finance Ministry regarding the legality of cryptocurrency mining, the specifics of the electricity allocation, and the broader implications for energy tariffs and national power distribution. Officials suggest that the IMF’s concerns may complicate the ongoing talks, and sources even pointed out that the economic team is already facing intense scrutiny. The IMF delegation currently in virtual discussions with Pakistani officials is expected to convene a separate session to address the country’s plan to power crypto mining and AI operations. Pakistan’s strategy is anchored by the establishment of the Pakistan Digital Asset Authority (PDAA), which was approved by the Finance Ministry on May 21. This authority will oversee regulation of exchanges, wallets, stablecoins, DeFi platforms, and the tokenization of national assets, aligning its mandate with international compliance frameworks like those of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Bilal Bin Saqib at the Bitcoin 2025 conference The announcement also followed Pakistan’s recent unveiling of its first strategic Bitcoin reserve at the Bitcoin 2025 conference. During the event, Bilal bin Saqib, crypto adviser to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, introduced a national Bitcoin wallet. This reflects Pakistan’s shifting stance on cryptocurrencies, which began earlier in 2025 with the proposal of a National Crypto Council to help draft a full regulatory framework and attract international investment. CZ signing documents Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao was appointed as an adviser to the Council in April and is expected to guide policy development, blockchain infrastructure, and crypto adoption across the country.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9392/czech-justice-minister-resigns-over-bitcoin-scandal,"BTC|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-02T06:08:36,"Charles Hoskinson: Cardano Is Becoming the De Facto Dev Platform for Bitcoin Script","In a recent statement shared via a tweet by the Angry Crypto Show account, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson declared that Cardano is rapidly becoming the primary development platform for Bitcoin script through the integration of BitVMX. The comment was made in a video clip attached to the tweet and has drawn attention within both the Cardano and Bitcoin development communities due to its implications for cross-chain compatibility and infrastructure development. In the video, Hoskinson stated that “Cardano is becoming the de facto dev platform for Bitcoin script,” referencing recent technical advancements made under the BitVMX initiative. He emphasized that Cardano’s platform could serve as the initial entry point for developers working with Bitcoin script. According to Hoskinson, BitVMX will continue to evolve and improve, becoming more capable, more efficient, and supported by a growing ecosystem over time. Hoskinson remarked, “What Cardano has effectively done, because of this work, Cardano is becoming the de facto dev platform for Bitcoin script, if you think about that. And that’s an amazing thing. “So, if you’re a Bitcoin developer now, your first entry point can be through BitVMX, and what you know is that over time that platform is going to get more capable, it’s going to get faster, it’s going to get cheaper to utilize, and ultimately it’s going to have a larger ecosystem around it.” JUST IN: #Cardano $ADA Founder Charles Hoskinson says ""Cardano is becoming the de facto dev platform for Bitcoin script.

This model offers deterministic behavior and concurrency advantages that are significant for developers building complex applications. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While Bitcoin script is known for its simplicity and security, it is also limited in functionality. BitVMX appears to address these limitations by enabling Bitcoin-aligned development within Cardano’s more expressive and scalable environment. Community Endorsement of the Multichain Vision The tweet gained support from members of the crypto developers community. One user, posting under the name T, commented that the cooperation between Bitcoin and Cardano is a meaningful technical innovation. He stated that BitVMX leverages Cardano’s architecture while preserving Bitcoin’s foundational principles. T noted that Cardano’s EUTXO model positions it well for this kind of cross-chain functionality and described the approach as a practical bridge between networks. According to them, BitVMX represents only the initial phase of what could become a broader development trend focused on combining Bitcoin’s security with Cardano’s programmability. Hoskinson Reaffirms Support for Interoperable Infrastructure Charles Hoskinson has previously advocated for multichain cooperation and modular infrastructure in blockchain ecosystems. The remarks regarding BitVMX reinforce that position, suggesting that future development efforts may increasingly focus on interoperability and shared resources between networks, rather than on siloed or isolated ecosystems. As the development of BitVMX progresses and more capabilities are introduced, further interest from Bitcoin developers may follow. The potential for faster and more cost-effective smart contract execution via Cardano’s infrastructure could open up new avenues for Bitcoin-script-based innovation.

Bitcoin BTC hovered around $105,000 in Asian morning hours Monday, slightly changed in the past 24 hours but down 5% over the past week. Ether ETH, XRP XRP, Solana’s SOL SOL, Cardano’s ADA ADA and dogecoin DOGE showed similar price action in the past 24 hours, with signs of a local bottom near support levels for all these tokens, indicating a potential rebound for intraday traders. “Bitcoin hovers around $105K as investors remain uncertain about short-term macroeconomic events,” said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research. “Uncertainty around inflation, tariffs, and the US economy slowed bullish trends in crypto, while geopolitical risks have also pushed investors to pull some capital from assets. “We remain optimistic over the long-term outlook for the crypto industry, with more institutions and users onboarding every day,” Ruck added. Trade tensions continue to weigh on risk sentiment. China said Monday that the U.S. had introduced new discriminatory restrictions on AI chip exports and software sales, and vowed to take measures to defend its interests.That backdrop has traders on edge. “Events over the last weekend showed just how quickly cryptocurrencies could react from even a slight escalation in trade war hostilities,” said Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, in a Telegram message to CoinDesk. Mei said traders should monitor announcements from both China and the US, as well as a potential escalation in Russia-Ukraine hostilities and several key US economic data releases this week, including the US trade deficit, unemployment numbers, and remarks from various Fed officials. “Currently macro developments are driving the majority of market movements so it’s difficult to predict, but we do see large institutions continuing to build up their crypto exposure so that’s a positive sign,” Mei added. Meanwhile, investors have been diversifying into tokens like XRP and SOL, even as Bitcoin’s price action has become more aligned with traditional risk assets, which some say adds to the long-term optimism. Kathy Qu, research manager at HashKey Cloud, told CoinDesk on Monday that “trade policy uncertainty drives capital into high-growth tech stocks, but savvy investors are also diversifying further into crypto, particularly TradFi-friendly assets like Bitcoin and XRP, where ETF optimism grows.” She added that staking and DeFi remain bright spots in the market, with real-world asset tokens seeing strong momentum and Ethereum ETFs poised to benefit from the SEC’s staking exemption — a move that’s expected to encourage more institutional participation in the DeFi sector.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/02/doge-xrp-sol-show-price-bottoming-as-bitcoin-traders-remain-optimistic,"BTC|DOGE|SOL|TRADING|XRP","Markets|Dogecoin|XRP|Solana|market analysis|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-02T06:00:02,"Dogecoin Price Could Break Down Completely If This Level Fails To Hold","Dogecoin price has been one of the hardest hit during the recent market drawdowns, and this comes even as the Bitcoin price is sitting very close to its new all-time highs. So far, the Dogecoin price has already tumbled below the $0.2 support, suggesting that the bears are back in control once again. This puts the meme coin at a perilous position , with a major support level swimming into view that it must hold or risk a massive tumble. Dogecoin Price Remains Bullish Above Trendline And Support Block Crypto analyst Lingrid has outlined where the Dogecoin price is currently sitting and the levels that are the defining factors for the meme coin right now. Currently, the pullback looks to be a result of an ABC decline. However, this pullback seems to be losing steam, especially as the bears have pushed the price back below $0.2. Lingrid explains that the Dogecoin price is still bullish despite this pullback, especially as the altcoin has put in a higher low on the ascending channel support. The $0.188-$0.190 zone continues to be important, and as long as this level is maintained, there is still bullish support for the meme coin. In addition to this, Lingrid also said that the Dogecoin structure remains bullish as the price is still above the trendline and support block. The major thing now is for buyers to reclaim control from the sellers for the bullishness to continue. In this case, a couple of buying zones have opened up between $0.187 and $0.19, and the Dogecoin price is right smack in the middle of this. Bulls only need to reclaim $0.195 with bullish confirmation for this to be complete, and then shoot for $0.215. However, there is still the risk of the eradication of this bullishness if the Dogecoin price breaks down below the higher low. If it falls below $0.187, then the crypto analyst says this is a sell signal. Consolidation below $0.195 is expected to delay the breakout, and a Bitcoin price drop could weaken the entire structure. DOGE Still Showing Strong Support Another crypto analyst, Stanley Crypto, has shown that a lot of support is still mounting for the Dogecoin price . Just like Lingrid, Stanley posits that $0.18 and $0.19 are important levels for the meme coin to hold . This is the strongest support zone now as the price has flatlined. This means that bulls have to maintain this level if there is to be any continuation of the bullish motion. “The setup suggests a potential uptrend with higher highs, but a breakdown below support may invalidate this move,” Stanley concluded.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-could-break/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt",cryptocompare
2025-06-02T05:59:41,"300 Bitcoin Donation to Ross Ulbricht Linked to ‘Questionable Source,’ Says ZachXBT","Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht received a donation of 300 Bitcoin, worth over $31m, to his official donation wallet on Sunday. The transaction, flagged by blockchain analysts and tracked by platforms such as Lookonchain and Arkham Intelligence, has sparked a wave of speculation across the crypto community. The funds appear to have passed through Jambler, a centralized Bitcoin mixing service, rather than more widely used decentralized privacy tools like Wasabi or Samourai. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT noted that two dormant addresses, active as far back as 2014 and 2019, deposited large sums into Jambler between April and May. These deposits coincided with the transfer to Ulbricht’s wallet, casting doubt on theories that the donation was a self-transfer from hidden pre-arrest funds. Update: Few entities regularly use Jambler in size so I found a potential demix for the donation. 1Mp5hH originates from late 2014 exchange activity. 1CNDW has 2019 exchange activity and was previously flagged in compliance tools. 1Mp5hH & 1CNDW were depositing in size to… — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) June 2, 2025 ZachXBT Links Ross Ulbricht Donation to Flagged Bitcoin Address According to ZachXBT, the donation likely was not a self-transfer as some had speculated, though it appears to have originated from a “questionable source.” The unusually large size of the gift, coupled with its obscure origin, has raised eyebrows. One of the addresses linked to the transaction, 1CNDW, had previously been flagged in compliance tools, adding to the concerns. Ulbricht Reflects on Prison and Freedom Ulbricht walked free in Jan. 2025 after serving 12 years of a double life sentence. His release followed a controversial pardon issued by US President Donald Trump . Since then, Ulbricht has re-entered public life, speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Nashville and auctioning personal memorabilia, including prison-era art and possessions. The donation arrived shortly after Ulbricht’s auction concluded, which had raised over $1.3m in Bitcoin. However, despite the timing, the 300 BTC transfer was not connected to the sale. This disconnect has only deepened the mystery surrounding its origin. The donation wallet, managed by the FreeRoss.org campaign, funds legal advocacy and public education around sentencing reform. While the money greatly supports these causes, its unclear path, especially through a centralized mixer, has cast a shadow over what might have been a celebratory moment. Meanwhile, Ulbricht addressed a packed audience in Nashville. He reflected on the dramatic shift in his life, recalling moments when he thought he might die in that “awful cage.” Still, he said he fought to find joy, even in the darkest times.

He calls it a “whole new architecture.” On Sunday, Musk teased the launch of XChat, an end-to-end encrypted messaging platform. The feature would include disappearing messages and audio/video calling “without a phone number across all platforms.” “All new XChat is rolling out with encryption, vanishing messages and the ability to send any kind of file,” he wrote to his 220 million followers. “Also, audio/video calling.” All new XChat is rolling out with encryption, vanishing messages and the ability to send any kind of file. Also, audio/video calling. This is built on Rust with (Bitcoin style) encryption, whole new architecture. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2025 Rust is a programming language known for its speed, memory safety and concurrency. The new architecture applies encryption methods similar to those used in Bitcoin. XChat: Enhances Privacy, Aligns With Musk’s Vision X (formerly Twitter) initially added its encrypted messaging feature in May 2023 for paid users. To X’s credit, it accompanied the new feature with an article on its help centre , breaking down the new feature’s strengths and weaknesses with unusual transparency. “We’re not quite there yet, but we’re working on it,” Musk said at the time. However, X paused the feature last week in order to focus on “making some improvements,” perhaps linked to the launch of XChat. Further, the feature aligns with Musk’s ambitious “ everything app ” vision, similar to China’s WeChat. With the launch, Musk appears to push for a more decentralized version. XChat is already accessible to some paid users on X. “It’s been a few days since Elon Musk is back in the office and we see that XChat is being rolled out to some users,” Nima Owji, an independent app researcher and web developer, wrote on X. It's been a few days since Elon Musk is back in the office and we see that X Chat is being rolled out to some users!

2025-06-02T05:22:24,"Bitcoin exchange reserves hit an all-time low — is a volatility spike coming?","Bitcoin’s supply on exchanges has fallen to its lowest level, raising expectations for a potential spike in volatility. According to data from CryptoQuant, the total amount of Bitcoin ( BTC ) held across all centralized exchanges decreased to just under 2.5 million BTC as of late May 2025. This steady drop has been accompanied by a strong price rally, with Bitcoin most recently reaching a new all-time high above $111,500. The data indicates a significant divergence between exchange reserves and prices. While the quantity of Bitcoin held on exchanges has been declining, its value has increased. On the CryptoQuant chart, this is illustrated by a white line moving upward for price, and a blue line sloping downward for reserves. Bitcoin price vs. exchange reserves. Credit: CryptoQuant Historically, a declining supply of Bitcoin on exchanges has driven up prices, particularly when demand is high. This is seen by many analysts as an indication that the market may be about to enter a new phase, where sharper moves in either direction are fueled by limited supply.

The total spend for the purchase came to 16.89b yen, equivalent to roughly $118m, pushing its cumulative Bitcoin holdings to 8,888 BTC. The latest acquisition, disclosed on Monday, is part of Metaplanet’s aggressive shift from its origins as a budget hotel operator to a Bitcoin-first corporate treasury model. That strategy, launched in 2024, has fueled both a meteoric rise in its share price and heightened scrutiny from hedge funds. CEO Simon Gerovich recently remarked that Metaplanet had become Japan’s most shorted stock , warning that betting against Metaplanet is like betting against Bitcoin. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 1,088 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 8,888 BTC* pic.twitter.com/X2clAIKNbR — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) June 2, 2025 Aggressive Bond Issuances Fuel Metaplanet’s Rapid BTC Accumulation To fund its crypto purchases, the company has been tapping capital markets at speed. On May 29, Metaplanet issued $21m through its 17th series of zero-coupon, non-interest-bearing bonds. This followed a $50m bond issuance slightly earlier. Proceeds from both have gone directly into Bitcoin acquisitions. Metaplanet now holds Bitcoin acquired at an average price of 13.76m yen per coin, or about $96,300, totaling 122.27b yen, which translates to about $856m. In just over two months, its holdings have soared from 4,046 BTC at the end of March to 8,888 BTC by early June, more than doubling its position. Metaplanet Cements Its Bitcoin-Centric Strategy With BTC Yield Up 66% The company tracks performance using a proprietary metric called BTC Yield. This measures Bitcoin accumulation per fully diluted share. Between April and June, BTC Yield rose 66.3%. This followed a sharp 95.6% jump in the previous quarter. When converted to yen, and then to dollars, the gains show the impact of Metaplanet’s strategy on shareholder value. This comes despite the dilutive effect of new equity issuance. In Dec. 2024, Bitcoin was formally made a core business vertical. Since then, Metaplanet has steadily pursued its vision through aggressive capital deployment. Now, as one of Asia’s boldest corporate adopters of Bitcoin, the company shows no signs of slowing down.

2025-06-02T03:54:34,"Elon Musk Announces 'Bitcoin-Style' XChat, But Tech Experts Are Skeptical","Tech billionaire Elon Musk, the boss of X (formerly Twitter), announced on Sunday the launch of a brand-new messaging app called XChat. Neither the bitcoin BTC market nor the tech community is impressed. One of the key features of the new offering is that it's built on a programming language called Rust with Bitcoin-style encryption. While it sounds exciting, the crypto community is not particularly psyched, raising doubts about what exactly it means. ""Bitcoin primarily uses signatures, not encryption. This is like saying, we decided to run our rocket on water, since NASA uses Hydrogen and Oxygen,"" Ian Miers, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Maryland, said on X . Encryption refers to the process of scrambling data so that only authorised parties with the correct keys can unscramble and read it. However, transactions executed on the Bitcoin blockchain aren't encrypted but are signed. In fact, all data shared between Bitcoin nodes is unencrypted, allowing total strangers to interact with the network. ""Needless to say ""Bitcoin style"" and ""Rust"" are not descriptions of an encryption scheme, nor are they strong indicators of security for a messaging app. Also, unless encrypted DMs are only in app, odds are they aren't just in Rust,"" Miers said . Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, traded flat near $105,000, having dropped over 3% last week, according to CoinDesk data. Other key features of the new offering include end-to-end encryption, disappearing messages, and the ability to send any type of file, including audio and video files, without a phone number across all platforms.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/06/02/elon-musk-announces-xchat-with-bitcoin-style-encryption-tech-experts-raise-questions,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET","Tech|Bitcoin|Elon Musk|Encryption|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-02T03:48:53,"Solana (SOL) Continues to Fall — Is a Reversal in Sight?","Solana started a fresh decline from the $172 zone. SOL price is now moving lower and might decline further below the $155 level. SOL price started a fresh decline from the $172 resistance zone against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $162 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $160 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $160 resistance zone. Solana Price Dips Again Solana price failed to continue higher above the $172 level and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL gained pace and traded below the $160 support level. The price even traded below the $155 level. A low was formed near $150 and the price recently started a recovery wave. There was a move above the $155 level. It surpassed the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $180 swing high to the $150 low. Solana is now trading below $160 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $160 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $160 level and the trend line. The next major resistance is near the $165 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $180 swing high to the $150 low. The main resistance could be $170. A successful close above the $170 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $172. Any more gains might send the price toward the $180 level. Another Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $160 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $155 zone. The first major support is near the $152 level. A break below the $152 level might send the price toward the $145 zone. If there is a close below the $145 support, the price could decline toward the $132 support in the near term.

2025-06-02T03:43:16,"‘XRP Has No Legal Clarity’: Expert Calls It Crypto’s Biggest Lie, Says XRP Is Clearer Than Bitcoin","The post ‘XRP Has No Legal Clarity’: Expert Calls It Crypto’s Biggest Lie, Says XRP Is Clearer Than Bitcoin appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The long-running legal battle between the SEC and Ripple just took another dramatic turn. Judge Analisa Torres, who has been overseeing the case, has rejected a joint request from both Ripple and the SEC that aimed to wrap up the lawsuit once and for all. This latest move means the fight isn’t over yet. The rejected filing was meant to adjust the penalty terms against Ripple and then clear the way for both sides to pull back their appeals. But Judge Torres wasn’t having it. Does XRP Have Legal Clarity? To add to the drama, there’s been a fresh claim doing the rounds online suggesting “XRP has no legal clarity” and lacks institutional backing. The post claimed no major CBDCs run on XRPL, and that only Bitcoin is part of the U.S. reserve . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why is XRP Price Going Down Today? , This didn’t sit well with pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan, who fired back hard. He called it “the biggest lie I’ve seen in crypto this year,” reminding everyone that Judge Torres already ruled XRP itself is not a security. And importantly — the SEC didn’t appeal that part of the decision. This is a lie. XRP has been found by a judge not itself to be a security. The SEC Appeal did not challenge that finding. To say XRP has no legal clarity is the biggest lie I have seen in crypto this year. https://t.co/6x1AycUxja — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 1, 2025 When someone argued that the judge’s comments were only dicta ( a legal term for remarks not legally binding ), Bill Morgan responded firmly, saying that even a dicta provides a degree of legal clarity. He explained that the reasoning used by Judge Torres is persuasive authority in court — and said that no court has found XRP to be a security, adding, “It has more judicial clarity than Bitcoin, which has none.” What’s Next for XRP? Despite the legal tussles, most experts believe a final resolution is still on the horizon. The rejected filing doesn’t impact XRP’s existing legal clarity or standing, and while the SEC and Ripple will have to revisit their penalty talks, the case’s key outcomes remain unchanged. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-02T02:08:00,"Ethereum price prediction for June 2024: will ETH rise to $4k?","Ethereum price had a strong performance in May as it finally made a bullish breakout, and the odds of it falling to $1,000 fell. ETH jumped to a high of $2,783, up by 100% from its lowest point this year. This article provides an ETH price prediction for June and what to expect. Ethereum price prediction The daily chart shows that the ETH price crashed to a low of $1,385 in April and then quickly rebounded to a high of $2,783 on May 19. Its highest point was along the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level. Ethereum price has formed a bullish flag pattern, comprising a vertical line and a rectangle pattern. This is one of the most bullish patterns in technical analysis. ETH price has jumped above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, a sign that it is about to form a golden cross pattern. Therefore, the most likely scenario is where the coin finally makes a strong bullish breakout as long as it remains above the 200-day moving average. If this happens, the next point to watch will be the psychological point at $3,000, which is about 20% above the current level. A break above $3,000 will be important because it will boost the chance of it rising to $4,000, the highest point in November last year. A move below the support at $2,300 will invalidate the bullish Ethereum price forecast. ETH price chart | Source: TradingView Top catalysts for the ETH price Ethereum price has numerous catalysts that may push its price higher in June. First, as we wrote on Sunday, Bitcoin price has a strong bullish outlook later this month, helped by its strong supply and demand dynamics. Its ETF demand is rising while supply on exchanges continues to fall. A strong Bitcoin price rebound will likely push other cryptocurrencies higher during the month. That’s because, historically, the two coins have a close correlation with each other. Second, ETH is seeing strong demand from Wall Street investors. The spot ETH ETFs have had strong inflows in the past few weeks. It had inflows in the last three consecutive weeks, bringing the cumulative total to $3.05 billion. Spot ETH ETFs added $285 million last week, up from $248 million and $41.5 million in the last two weeks. They also had inflows for two consecutive months. Third, data shows that the supply of Ethereum held in exchanges continued to fall, a sign that holders are not selling as much. There are now 7.6 million coins, down from 10.75 million in January. Falling exchange volume is a bullish sign that investors are no longer selling as they did before. Further, there are signs that whales are still accumulating Ethereum, possibly because they believe it is a bargain. The supply held by whales has jumped to 103.6 million, up from 102 million in February. ETH whales chart | Source: Santiment Ethereum has more bullish fundamentals. For example, RWA data shows that it is the biggest chain in the real-world-asset tokenization industry, which has over $23 billion in on-chain assets. Ethereum has a 59% market share in this industry, and is followed by ZKsync Era, Stellar, Aptos, Solana, and Polygon. Ethereum is also the biggest player in decentralized finance (DeFi) with over $131 billion in assets and $124 billion in stablecoins. Its $131 billion TVL gives it a market share to 61%, while its stablecoin assets account for about 50% of all assets. Therefore, these fundamentals will point to more gains.

2025-06-02T01:42:21,"Why is XRP Price Going Down Today?","The post Why is XRP Price Going Down Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights XRP Tests Key Support Zone at $2.10–$2.15: Traders closely watch this critical Fibonacci level as a drop below could trigger a deeper decline. Potential Boost from Ripple-SEC Case: A favorable legal outcome could reshape XRP’s future and spark a bullish reversal. The price of XRP has been under pressure lately , and traders are closely watching some key levels on the charts. After recently hitting a high near $2.47, XRP has struggled to hold steady and has been stuck in a downtrend. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $2.17, slightly recovering after dipping to a low of $2.13 earlier. The price is battling to stay above the important average level of $2.15, but it hasn’t been easy. Important Levels To Watch Right now, XRP is retesting an important Fibonacci support zone between $2.10 and $2.15. This level has provided strong support in the past, and bulls will need to defend it to prevent further losses. If the price drops below $2.10 and confirms with a daily candle close, things could get worse. In that case, the next support levels to watch would be around $2.05 and then possibly closer to $2.00. A break below $2.00 could be bad news for XRP, with the risk of a fall towards $1.80–$1.70. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : ‘XRP Has No Legal Clarity’: Expert Calls It Crypto’s Biggest Lie, Says XRP Is Clearer Than Bitcoin , Resistance on the Way Up On the upside, there’s tough resistance waiting between $2.30 and $2.34, with more sellers likely around $2.44 and then between $2.56 and $2.62. Unless XRP can break through these zones, it’s unlikely to see any strong bullish moves soon. XRP’s recent drop follows broader market weakness. Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies also fell and tested key support levels after uncertainty over U.S. tariff news weighed on investor sentiment. However, there’s a silver lining for XRP holders. Ripple’s long-running legal battle with the SEC might be nearing its end , and if the outcome is favorable, it could reshape XRP’s regulatory status. This would be a positive for the token and might give its price a much-needed boost in the near future. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-02T00:22:59,"Asia Morning Briefing: Bitcoin Stalls at $105K as Analyst Says Market Looks 'Overheated'","Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin BTC is trading above $105,000 as Asia begins its business week. The world's largest digital asset remained relatively stable over the weekend, with a 0.4% movement, and trading volume was compressed. While overall market conditions remain bullish, a new report from CryptoQuant suggests that certain metrics indicate the BTC market is “overheating.” The report shows bitcoin demand has climbed to 229,000 BTC over the past 30 days, approaching the December 2024 peak of 279,000 BTC. At the same time, whale-held balances have risen by 2.8 percent, a pace that often signals slowing accumulation. These indicators suggest the current rally, which pushed prices to a record $112,000, may be nearing a short-term top. The report highlights $120,000 as the next major resistance level, tied to the upper band of the Traders’ On-chain Realized Price, where unrealized profits would hit 40 percent, a threshold that has historically marked local tops. While CryptoQuant’s ""Bull Score Index"" remains strong at 80, signaling continued bullish momentum, rising profit margins, and peaking demand growth suggest traders may face a period of consolidation before the next leg higher. News Roundup: James Wynn Gets Liquidated, But Says He'll 'Run it All Back' James Wynn, a trader renowned for his aggressive, high-leverage bets on Hyperliquid, has been fully liquidated, leaving him with just $23 in his account after sustaining losses totaling more than $17 million, CoinDesk previously reported. Wynn, who attracted significant attention with trades involving bitcoin, memecoins like PEPE, and even obscure tokens such as FARTCOIN, first faced steep declines from a massive $1.25 billion long position on BTC, resulting in a loss exceeding $37 million after prices dipped below $105,000 amid geopolitical turmoil. Throughout the volatile month, Wynn rapidly cycled through trades, briefly netting an unrealized gain of $85 million before market swings wiped him out completely. An account associated with Wynn downplayed the dramatic liquidation, defiantly stating on X: ""I'll run it back, I always do. And I'll enjoy doing it. I like playing the game. I took a large and calculated bet at making billions."" Brazil's Méliuz Shares Sink 8% After Announcing $78M Equity Raise to Buy Bitcoin Brazilian fintech Méliuz plans to raise up to $78 million through a public equity offering, intending to allocate all proceeds to purchasing Bitcoin and positioning the cryptocurrency as a primary strategic asset in its treasury, CoinDesk previously reported . However, Méliuz’s strategy hasn't impressed the market yet, as shares dropped more than 8% following the announcement. The initial offering includes 17 million common shares, with the potential to expand up to 51 million, and investors will receive subscription warrants allowing future stock purchases at set prices. Known for its cashback and financial services platform serving over 30 million users, Méliuz currently holds 320.2 BTC, having previously committed 10% of its cash reserves to Bitcoin in March. Trading for the subscription warrants is expected to commence on June 16, with share settlement and warrant issuance finalized by June 18. NYC Comptroller Rejects Mayor Adams' 'BitBond', Warns Deviating from Dollar Could Undermine City's Credit Reputation New York City's Comptroller Brad Lander sharply criticized Mayor Eric Adams' plan to issue municipal bonds backed by bitcoin, labeling the proposed ""BitBond"" as ""legally dubious and fiscally irresponsible,"" CoinDesk previously reported. Lander rejected the idea just days after Adams introduced it at a bitcoin conference in Las Vegas, emphasizing that cryptocurrency's instability makes it unsuitable to reliably fund critical city projects such as infrastructure and affordable housing. Mayor Adams has actively promoted cryptocurrency initiatives since entering office, including converting his own paychecks into digital assets and establishing a digital asset advisory council. However, Comptroller Lander highlighted serious practical concerns with the BitBond proposal, noting federal tax laws and city financial regulations would make the proposal unworkable, and warned that deviating from the dollar-based municipal borrowing system could undermine investor confidence and New York City's credit reputation. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin showed resilience, staging a V-shaped recovery between $103,813.37 and $105,305.75 amid notable volume spikes. ETH: Ethereum formed a bullish reversal pattern, rebounding from strong support at $2,472.84 to $2,527.53 amid high-volume buying momentum, according to CoinDesk's Market Insight Bot. Gold: Gold climbed 0.6% to $3,311.66, as traders weighed its recent retreat from record highs against ongoing investor and central bank appetite driven by uncertainty over US tariffs and broader economic risks.

2025-06-02T00:02:00,"Top crypto price predictions: Flare, Horizen, Cookie DAO","Top crypto prices were mixed on Monday morning, continuing the recent trend in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin’s price held steady above $105,000, while Ethereum’s price was above $2,500. This article provides forecasts for the top three coins like Flare (FLR), Horizen (ZEN), and Cookie DAO (COOKIE). Flare price forecast ahead of a big unlock FLR price chart | Source: TradingView Flare token rose as traders focused on the upcoming token unlock later this week. It will unlock tokens worth over $39 million , equivalent to 3% of the total tokens in circulation. Token unlocks are usually bearish since they introduce new coins in the market, boosting supplies. The daily chart shows that the Flare token price was trading at $0.020 on Monday, a few points higher than the weekend low of $0.01623. It is also about 80% above the lowest point this year. ZEN price has remained above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), a sign that bulls remains in control for now. It also formed a hammer candlestick on Friday, which explains why it has risen in the past two days. A hammer comprises of a small body and a long lower wick. Flare price has also formed a falling wedge pattern, a popular bullish reversal pattern. Therefore, the coin will likely rebound, with the next point to watch being at $0.02240, its highest point in May. Horizen price prediction as a wedge forms ZEN price chart | Source: TradingView Horizen token price was trading at $9.955 on Monday morning, up by 55% from its lowest point in April. This recovery is because of the ongoing crypto market rally and demand for privacy coins. Horizen price was hovering between the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. It has also formed a rising wedge, comprising of two ascending and converging trendlines. A wedge is one of the most bearish patterns in technical analysis. This breakdown normally happens when the two lines are about to converge. In ZEN’s case, the two lines have a long way to converge, meaning that the consolidation will continue. The key support and resistance levels are $9 and $12.5. Cookie DAO price forecast Read more: Bitcoin price prediction for June: Will BTC rise or fall in June? Cookie price chart | Source: TradingView Cookie price has done well in the past few weeks as it jumped by 260% from the lowest point in April. This surge has brought the market cap to over $130 million, making it a top player in the BSC Chain network. The eight-hour chart shows that the Cookie price formed a cup and handle pattern, a popular bullish continuation sign. The lower side of this cup is at $0.070, while the upper side is at $0.30. This means that the cup has a depth of about 75%. The recent retreat was part of the formation of the handle section of the cup. Therefore, by measuring 75% from the cup’s upper side, we can estimate the most likely Cookie price prediction at $0.54, which is about 112% above the current level. A drop below the support at $0.2100 will invalidate the bullish outlook.

2025-06-02T00:00:15,"Insurance Companies Looking To Capitalize on Crypto Investors Who Fear Kidnapping: Report","Insurance companies are reportedly looking to capitalize on the rising incidents of kidnapping and physical violence targeting crypto millionaires. NBC News reports that at least three companies that provide insurance and security services for cryptocurrency investors and firms are preparing to offer kidnap and ransom (K&R) insurance policies for those with security concerns stemming from their crypto holdings. According to Rebecca Rubenfeld, chief operating officer at the crypto insurance firm AnchorWatch, the fear of violence was a big topic at the annual Bitcoin Conference that was held in Las Vegas last week. “They’re tense. I’m not saying that because I’m trying to sell insurance, but overall, the mood is a very good environment for me.” AnchorWatch is considering offering kidnapping and ransom protection in the coming months. The news comes after a string of reports emerged about the kidnapping of crypto investors. Last month, armed assailants reportedly tried to abduct the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noiza, the CEO of the French crypto exchange platform Paymium, in Paris. In another incident, three teenagers allegedly stole $4 million worth of cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) from a man who hosted a crypto-related event in Las Vegas and left him stranded at White Hills, Arizona. And last week in New York City, a kidnapper allegedly tortured and threatened a crypto investor for three weeks to gain access to his Bitcoin ( BTC ) wallet.

2025-06-01T23:00:48,"Google Gemini Predicts Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price for June 30, 2025","The cryptocurrency landscape, particularly the world of meme coins, continues to draw attention from traders, investors, and enthusiasts eager to decipher short-term price trends. Among these speculative digital assets, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has remained a top favorite, captivating the crypto community with its vibrant ecosystem, strong community backing, and meme-driven hype. As June 2025 begins, many are eager to understand where SHIB might head by month’s end. In this analysis, we delve into Google Gemini’s AI-generated price predictions for Shiba Inu (SHIB) by June 30, 2025, and explore the underlying market conditions that could influence these outcomes. Current Market Snapshot As of report time, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.00001297. SHIB’s price movement over the past few weeks has been largely sideways, with occasional dips reflecting the prevailing bearish sentiment. While major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dictate general market momentum, meme coins like SHIB are especially vulnerable to sharp swings in sentiment, often reacting intensely to social media trends, whale activity, and ecosystem announcements. Google Gemini’s price predictions for June 30, 2025, acknowledge these dynamics and offer three distinct scenarios: modest, moderate, and bullish. Each scenario is grounded in current price action and potential short-term developments, avoiding heavy reliance on third-party analyst forecasts. Modest Scenario In the modest outlook, Google Gemini suggests that if current bearish pressures persist or if the market remains largely stagnant, SHIB is likely to hover near its present levels or experience a minor decline. This places the expected price range between $0.000012 and $0.000013 by the end of June. Such a scenario assumes that no major catalysts emerge to drive fresh buying momentum. Without news of ecosystem upgrades, major partnerships, or substantial improvements in Shiba Inu’s DeFi, gaming, or metaverse initiatives, the token may simply follow the broader crypto market’s consolidation pattern. Moderate Scenario The moderate prediction envisions a more optimistic, albeit restrained, trajectory for SHIB. If minor positive developments occur, such as incremental upgrades in the Shibarium layer-2 network, enhanced staking mechanisms, or small but impactful partnership announcements, the token could experience a slight boost. Google Gemini forecasts that under these circumstances, SHIB might trade between $0.0000135 and $0.0000145 by June 30. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This outcome also hinges on a mild shift in investor sentiment. Even a subtle change in the risk appetite of retail traders or a temporary uptick in meme coin enthusiasm on platforms like X could propel SHIB modestly higher. While not indicative of a full-fledged bull run, this middle-ground scenario suggests that SHIB retains some room for short-term growth if supported by favorable, albeit limited, catalysts. Bullish Outlook For the bullish scenario, Google Gemini emphasizes the need for a significant uptick in buying pressure, which could push SHIB into the $0.000015 to $0.000017 range by the end of June. Achieving this bullish outcome would require a combination of factors, including a reversal in the broader crypto market’s risk sentiment and substantial, SHIB-specific catalysts. Potential triggers might include a surprise rally in Bitcoin or Ethereum, which often lifts altcoins alongside it, or headline-making developments within the SHIB ecosystem. For example, large-scale Shibarium adoption, accelerated token burns, or the introduction of a highly anticipated project within the SHIB metaverse could ignite fresh investor excitement. Notably, given the bearish tone characterizing early June, achieving such a rapid turnaround would demand not just incremental news but a compelling, confidence-restoring event. The Unpredictable Nature of Meme Coins While these predictions provide structured estimates, it’s essential to underscore the speculative nature of meme coins like Shiba Inu. Unlike blue-chip assets with strong institutional backing and clear utility, meme coins are particularly susceptible to sudden shifts driven by social media trends, influencer commentary, and retail trading frenzies. Even AI-generated forecasts, no matter how sophisticated, cannot fully account for the unpredictable emotional surges that often define the meme coin market. While the modest and moderate scenarios appear more likely in the absence of dramatic market shifts, the crypto market’s inherently unpredictable nature leaves the door open for a surprise bullish surge. Traders and investors are reminded to approach meme coins with caution, balancing enthusiasm with sound risk management.

2025-06-01T22:37:40,"Market Players Conflicted over the Arrival of Altcoin Season, Here’s What They’re Saying","Cryptocurrency personalities share different sentiments regarding the highly talked-about altcoin season, a period in the crypto market when alternative assets outperform Bitcoin in the majority. According to entrepreneur and Bitcoin investor Lark Davis, Bitcoin’s recent bullish performance has failed to stimulate excitement within the broader cryptocurrency market. The investor is convinced the missing piece is the highly anticipated altcoin season. “This cycle has been mostly about Bitcoin so far. Even though BTC smashed through all-time highs, there’s no excitement in the market. The reason is simple: Everyone and their dog are sitting in altcoins, and that’s why even though BTC is near ATHs, altcoin index is sitting at 27 (real altseason starts at 75).” He wrote . As the analyst asserts, Bitcoin has outperformed this in this current market cycle, with a continuous bullish milestone recorded monthly. The asset kicked off 2025 hovering above the $90,000 price mark, before hitting $100,000 briefly, in the latter part of January and February. Last week, Bitcoin hit a new ATH of $111,970 before returning below the $110,000 level. The big bull is trading at a press time price of $109,795. On the other hand, Cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen observed that altcoin and Bitcoin pairs are trading at significantly lower levels. Countering that altcoin season is around the corner, he highlighted the continued downward trend observed within the altcoin market over the last 4 years. “ALT/BTC pairs just put in their lowest weekly close all cycle. Those that call for alt season each week may sound confident and contrarian, but altcoins have been bleeding to Bitcoin almost non-stop since 2021.” Cowen wrote . Where is “altcoin season”? While altcoin season is typically expected to arrive 6-9 months after every Bitcoin halving, the years after the halving year leave analysts gauging, using altcoin season index aggregators designed to analyze the performance of the top 50 altcoins in the market. These aggregators track factors including increased trading volume, increased altcoin dominance, and frequent price breakouts. Altcoin season indexes currently sit at 16, indicating that only 16% of existing altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over 90 days. It is also worth noting that altcoins fail to outperform Bitcoin during some market cycles and continue to trade downward or sideways.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/market-players-conflicted-over-the-arrival-of-altcoin-season-heres-what-theyre-saying/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Cryptocurrency|News|Altcoin|Cryptocurrency News",cryptocompare

As expectations for the coming weeks heighten, price predictions are flying in consistently. Standard Chartered, the British multinational bank, is one notable institution that has doubled down on its previous Bitcoin price forecast, which can be considered one of the boldest price predictions made thus far. According to the international bank, Bitcoin is on track to hit the $500,000 price mark before President Donald Trump exits office. Notably, the current president’s second term, which began on January 20, 2025, will elapse on January 20, 2029.

Geoffrey Kendrick, the global head of Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered, points to a rise in institutional interest as a catalyst for a long-term price boom. “The 13F data from the US Securities and Exchange Commission supports our core thesis that Bitcoin will reach $500,000 before Trump leaves office. Bitcoin is attracting a wide range of institutional players.” Kendrick asserted. According to the SEC , Form 13F is a “statutory directive” created to inform the public about the securities holdings of leading institutional investors. Kendrick explains the significance of the data, stating the following; “The quarterly 13F data is the best test of our thesis that BTC will attract new institutional buyer types as the market matures, helping the price reach our USD 500,000 target level.” He added. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is kicking off the new week on a lukewarm note, with bulls failing to hold above the $110,000 mark. Although gains sustained over the last 7 days are up 5.70%, hourly losses sit at 0.08% during this report. Bitcoin is valued at $108,950 at press time.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/standard-chartered-sticks-to-its-gun-says-bitcoin-could-hit-500000-before-trump-leaves-office/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare
