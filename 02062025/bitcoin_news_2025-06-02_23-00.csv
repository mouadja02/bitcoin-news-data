2025-06-02T20:50:55,"Crucial Bitcoin Correction Hits: What Macro Factors Mean for BTC Price","BitcoinWorld Crucial Bitcoin Correction Hits: What Macro Factors Mean for BTC Price Are you wondering why Bitcoin (BTC) has pulled back recently after such an impressive run? You’re not alone. The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a significant event: a Bitcoin correction . After soaring by 50% since April and reaching remarkable highs, including a reported peak of $111,880 according to Bitfinex’s weekly report, Bitfinex Alpha, BTC is undergoing its first major price adjustment. This isn’t necessarily cause for panic, but understanding the forces behind it is crucial for any crypto enthusiast or investor. Why is the Crypto Market Seeing a Pullback? Understanding the Macro Factors Several powerful forces are converging to influence the current crypto market dynamics. It’s not just about internal crypto trends; the broader global economic landscape, often referred to as macro factors , plays a significant role. Think of it like a ship navigating both internal engine performance and external ocean currents and weather patterns. Here are some of the key macro headwinds impacting Bitcoin and the wider market: Renewed U.S. Tariffs: Imposing tariffs on goods from other countries can disrupt global supply chains, potentially leading to increased costs for businesses and consumers. This can dampen economic activity and lead investors to become more cautious, pulling back from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Surging U.S. Treasury Yields: When the yields on government bonds rise, they offer investors a relatively safe return. Higher bond yields make riskier investments, like Bitcoin, comparatively less attractive. This can lead to capital flowing out of crypto and into traditional safe havens. General Economic Uncertainty: Beyond specific policies, a general climate of economic uncertainty, influenced by inflation concerns, geopolitical events, and shifts in monetary policy, can lead to reduced risk appetite across financial markets. These external pressures create a less favorable environment for assets that have experienced rapid appreciation, making them more susceptible to pullbacks. Market Overheating: Signs from Derivatives and On-Chain Data While macro factors provide the external context, internal market indicators were also flashing warning signs that a correction might be on the horizon. The rapid 50% rally created conditions ripe for a reset. Key indicators pointed towards potential overheating: Derivatives Market Activity: The open interest in BTC options, a measure of the total number of outstanding options contracts, hit an all-time high of $49.4 billion. This massive figure indicates a significant amount of speculation and hedging activity. High open interest can signal leverage building up in the system, which can lead to cascading liquidations during price drops, accelerating the correction. On-Chain Indicators: Analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain itself provides valuable insights into investor behavior. Indicators like the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) or Market-Value-to-Realized-Value (MVRV) can signal when a large portion of the market is sitting on significant unrealized profits. When these indicators reach certain thresholds, they suggest a state of ‘euphoria’ and historically precede ‘local tops’ – temporary peaks before a price decline as investors take profits. Combined, the high leverage in derivatives and the ‘euphoria’ signals from on-chain data suggested the market was technically primed for a cooldown. The rally was strong, but perhaps too fast, leading to an unsustainable level of speculative positioning. Is This Correction Structural Weakness or a Healthy Reset for BTC Price? A crucial question during any significant price drop is whether it signals fundamental problems with the asset or market, or if it’s a normal part of the market cycle. According to the Bitfinex report and many analysts focused on Bitcoin analysis , the current decline appears to be the latter – a healthy reset. Here’s why it’s viewed as a normal, rather than structural, correction: Profit-Taking: After a 50% rally, many investors who bought at lower prices are naturally looking to lock in gains. This selling pressure is a primary driver of the initial price drop. Leverage Unwinding: As the price falls, leveraged positions (trades made with borrowed funds) start to incur losses. If losses exceed margin requirements, these positions are automatically closed (liquidated), forcing more selling onto the market. This ‘unwinding’ process is painful in the short term but flushes excessive risk out of the system. Lack of Fundamental Issues: The correction isn’t being driven by a problem with Bitcoin’s underlying technology, security, or adoption trajectory. The network is functioning as intended, and long-term adoption trends remain positive. Corrections are a natural and often necessary part of asset markets, especially volatile ones like crypto. They shake out speculative excess, allow prices to consolidate, and can create healthier conditions for future growth by bringing prices back to more sustainable levels based on fundamental value and adoption. Beyond the Pullback: The Enduring Story of Global Bitcoin Adoption Despite the short-term price volatility and macro headwinds, the long-term trend of global Bitcoin adoption continues unabated. This underlies the argument that the current correction is not structural. Here are some recent examples highlighting crypto’s continued integration into global finance: GameStop’s $513M BTC Buy: The video game retailer announced a significant purchase of Bitcoin for its corporate treasury. This follows a trend of publicly traded companies adding BTC to their balance sheets as a hedge against inflation and a store of value, signaling increasing institutional confidence. U.S. Easing 401(k) Crypto Restrictions: Regulatory moves in the U.S. are making it potentially easier for individuals to include crypto investments in their retirement plans. This opens up a massive pool of capital to the crypto market and signals a growing acceptance by financial regulators (though challenges remain). Russia Allowing Crypto-Linked Instruments: Reports indicate Russia is moving towards allowing certain financial instruments linked to cryptocurrencies for qualified investors. While potentially driven by geopolitical factors and a desire for alternative financial rails, it nonetheless represents a significant step towards legitimizing crypto within a major global economy. Continued Infrastructure Development: Payment processors, financial institutions, and technology companies continue to build infrastructure around Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, making them easier to buy, sell, and use. These developments demonstrate that while the price may fluctuate due to market cycles and macro events, the underlying trend of integration and adoption into mainstream finance and commerce remains strong. This is a critical factor for the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin. What Does This Mean for You? Actionable Insights Navigating a Bitcoin correction can be challenging, but understanding the context provides clarity. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep track of both crypto-specific news (on-chain data, development updates) and global macro trends (interest rates, inflation, geopolitical events). Understand Market Cycles: Corrections are normal. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term price movements. Focus on your long-term investment strategy. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Ensure your exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies aligns with your personal risk tolerance and financial goals. Volatility is inherent in this market. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider using a DCA strategy, investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of price. Corrections can be opportunities to accumulate assets at lower prices. Reduce Leverage: If you are using leverage in derivatives markets, be acutely aware of the liquidation risks during periods of high volatility and potential corrections. Focusing on the long-term potential and the fundamental adoption trends, rather than getting caught up in short-term price swings, is key to successful participation in the crypto market. Conclusion: A Necessary Pause in Bitcoin’s Journey The recent Bitcoin correction , following a substantial rally and reaching notable highs, is a complex event driven by a confluence of factors. Macroeconomic headwinds, including U.S. tariffs and rising Treasury yields, have created a less favorable environment for risk assets. Simultaneously, signs of overheating within the crypto market itself, such as record high options open interest and on-chain euphoria signals, indicated that a pullback was technically overdue. However, the analysis suggests this is a healthy, albeit sharp, reset driven by natural market forces like profit-taking and the unwinding of excessive leverage, rather than any fundamental structural weakness in Bitcoin or the broader crypto ecosystem. The continued global adoption by corporations like GameStop, easing regulatory stances, and integration into traditional finance underscore the enduring strength and potential of Bitcoin beyond short-term price volatility. For investors, understanding these dynamics and focusing on long-term strategy, rather than reacting emotionally to price swings, is paramount during such market phases. This correction, while potentially uncomfortable, serves to strengthen the market foundation for future growth.

2025-06-02T20:40:55,"Shocking Bitcoin Correlation: JGB Yields Now More Influential Than Nasdaq, Analyst Says","BitcoinWorld Shocking Bitcoin Correlation: JGB Yields Now More Influential Than Nasdaq, Analyst Says The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, and understanding what drives Bitcoin’s price movements is crucial for investors. While Bitcoin has often been seen correlating with traditional risk assets like tech stocks on the Nasdaq, recent market observations suggest a fascinating shift is underway. Global market analyst Weston Nakamura has highlighted a surprising new dynamic: a stronger Bitcoin correlation with 30-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields. Understanding the Shift: Bitcoin Correlation and JGB Yields For years, market observers frequently noted Bitcoin’s price movements often mirrored those of growth stocks, particularly those listed on the Nasdaq . This correlation positioned Bitcoin, for many, as a high-beta tech asset – something that performs well when risk appetite is high and struggles when investors seek safety. However, the narrative appears to be changing. According to analyst Weston Nakamura, recent data points to a different primary driver. He noted via X that Bitcoin’s behavior has shown a more significant relationship with 30-year JGB yields than with the Nasdaq. This observation is particularly compelling because it aligns with the idea that Bitcoin might be decoupling from traditional risk assets. Nakamura specifically pointed to instances like Bitcoin’s surge around the U.S. spot BTC ETF launch and U.S. President Donald Trump’s election prospects. Following these events, Bitcoin’s price action seemed to align more closely with the trajectory of JGB yields, especially as these bond yields reached multi-year highs in May. This potential shift in Bitcoin correlation is not just academic; it has significant implications for how investors perceive and trade the leading cryptocurrency. Why JGB Yields? Decoding the Unexpected Correlation At first glance, a strong link between a volatile digital asset like Bitcoin and the yields of sovereign bonds from a country known for its ultra-low interest rates might seem counter-intuitive. Japanese Government Bonds, especially longer-term ones like the 30-year, are typically considered safe-haven assets within traditional finance, though their yields have been historically suppressed by the Bank of Japan’s monetary policy. So, why might Bitcoin’s price movements be tracking JGB yields more closely than the Nasdaq? Several factors could be at play: Global Liquidity Dynamics: Changes in major global bond markets, particularly those as significant as Japan’s, can signal shifts in global liquidity or investor sentiment towards longer-term assets. As JGB yields rise, it might reflect changing expectations about inflation, economic growth, or the Bank of Japan’s future policy direction. These macro-level shifts can influence capital flows across different asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Search for Alternative Yield/Store of Value: In a world where traditional bond yields have been low or negative, investors might be seeking alternative assets that can potentially offer returns or act as a store of value in a changing economic landscape. While risky, Bitcoin is sometimes viewed through this lens, particularly by those wary of inflation or currency devaluation. A rise in JGB yields, even from low levels, might coincide with broader market adjustments that also affect the perceived value or demand for Bitcoin. Institutional Flows: Large institutional investors manage vast portfolios that include both traditional bonds and increasingly, digital assets. Their allocation decisions are influenced by global macroeconomic factors, including bond market movements. If significant capital is moving in or out of major bond markets like Japan’s, it could indirectly impact the demand for or supply of assets like Bitcoin held within these portfolios. Deleveraging/Risk-Off Signals: Sometimes, unexpected correlations can arise from complex deleveraging events or broad risk-off moves that aren’t immediately obvious. A spike in yields in a typically low-yield environment might signal underlying stress or significant positioning adjustments that ripple across global markets, affecting both bonds and seemingly unrelated assets like Bitcoin. This newfound connection highlights the increasing complexity of the cryptocurrency market and its evolving relationship with the broader financial ecosystem. It underscores the need for sophisticated market analysis that looks beyond traditional correlations. Is Bitcoin Truly Decoupling from Traditional Risk Assets? The observation of a stronger Bitcoin correlation with JGB yields than with the Nasdaq feeds into a larger debate: Is Bitcoin genuinely decoupling from traditional risk assets? For years, many analysts lumped Bitcoin into the same category as tech stocks – volatile assets that thrive in periods of easy money and investor optimism. The recent behavior suggests Bitcoin might be forging its own path, influenced by a different set of global macro factors. The surge during events like the U.S. spot ETF approval and political shifts indicates specific catalysts are at play, which then seem to align with bond market dynamics rather than just general risk-on/risk-off sentiment reflected in equity indices like the Nasdaq. If Bitcoin is indeed decoupling, it could mean: It is maturing into a distinct asset class with unique drivers. Its value proposition (e.g., digital scarcity, decentralized nature) is being assessed differently by large capital flows. It might offer better diversification potential within a traditional portfolio than previously thought, though this is still heavily debated. However, it’s crucial to approach this with caution. Market correlations are not static; they can change rapidly depending on the prevailing economic climate, investor sentiment, and specific events. What holds true today might not hold true tomorrow. A period of strong correlation with JGB yields could be temporary, driven by specific circumstances in global bond markets or unique positioning by large players. Challenges and Nuances in Market Analysis Analyzing market correlations, especially for an asset as novel as Bitcoin, comes with inherent challenges. The relationship observed between Bitcoin correlation and JGB yields , while noted by a reputable analyst, requires deeper investigation and should be viewed as one data point among many. Key challenges include: Causation vs. Correlation: A correlation doesn’t necessarily imply causation. Both Bitcoin and JGB yields could be reacting independently to a third, unseen global macroeconomic factor. Data Volatility: Bitcoin’s market is highly volatile. Short-term correlations can appear and disappear quickly, making it difficult to establish long-term trends based on brief observations. Market Structure Differences: The JGB market is dominated by large institutions and influenced heavily by central bank policy. The Bitcoin market, while increasingly institutionalized, still has significant retail participation and is influenced by technological developments, regulatory news, and social sentiment in ways that traditional bonds are not. Defining “Risk Assets”: The term “ risk assets ” itself can be broad. While the Nasdaq is a key index for growth stocks, Bitcoin’s classification is still debated – is it a tech stock proxy, digital gold, or something else entirely? Therefore, while Weston Nakamura’s observation provides valuable insight for market analysis , investors should use it as part of a broader analytical framework, considering multiple potential drivers for Bitcoin’s price. Actionable Insights for Investors If the observed Bitcoin correlation with JGB yields persists or becomes a more established pattern, what does this mean for investors? Here are some potential actionable insights: Expand Your Macro Horizon: Don’t just watch equity markets. Pay attention to major global bond markets, especially those in significant economies like Japan. Understand the factors influencing long-term yields. Re-evaluate Bitcoin’s Role: Consider whether Bitcoin fits into your portfolio as just a “tech bet” or if its behavior suggests it might be reacting to different, perhaps more fundamental, global liquidity or monetary policy signals. Diversify Analytical Tools: Incorporate macroeconomic indicators beyond inflation and interest rates in major Western economies. Look at bond yield curves, central bank policies in other major economies, and global capital flow reports. Stay Informed, But Be Critical: Market analysis like Nakamura’s is insightful but represents a snapshot. Continuously evaluate correlations and narratives as new data emerges. Avoid making drastic portfolio changes based on short-term correlation shifts alone. Risk Management Remains Key: Regardless of what Bitcoin correlates with, its inherent volatility means position sizing and risk management are paramount. Treat it as a high-risk asset, whatever its perceived correlation at any given moment. Understanding the complex web of global finance and how Bitcoin fits into it is an ongoing process. The potential shift in Bitcoin correlation away from the Nasdaq and towards assets like JGB yields is a compelling development that warrants close attention from anyone serious about navigating the cryptocurrency market. Conclusion: A New Chapter in Bitcoin’s Market Behavior? Weston Nakamura’s observation regarding Bitcoin’s stronger correlation with 30-year JGB yields compared to the Nasdaq presents a significant point for discussion and further research within the cryptocurrency and traditional finance communities. It challenges the prevailing narrative of Bitcoin purely as a high-beta tech stock proxy and suggests it may be reacting to different, potentially more complex, global macroeconomic forces. This potential decoupling from traditional risk assets , if it continues, could signal a maturation of the asset class and a shift in how large capital flows interact with it. While the reasons behind this specific Bitcoin correlation with JGB yields are likely multifaceted and require continued market analysis , the observation itself is a reminder that the drivers of Bitcoin’s price are dynamic and increasingly intertwined with the broader global financial landscape. Investors and enthusiasts alike should watch these evolving correlations closely, using them as valuable data points to inform their understanding and strategies in this ever-changing market.

At the time of publication, on-chain data showed that BlackRock currently holds around $73 million in Bitcoin. On-chain data also showed a 7% rise in Bitcoin exchange inflows over the past 24 hours, totaling 22,300 BTC across major platforms like Binance and Coinbase. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is currently exchanging hands at $104,689, a 4.51% decrease in the last 7 days. At the same time, trading volume for BTC/USD on Coinbase inched up by 12% within the last hour, reaching 18,500 BTC traded, suggesting increased market activity caused by the news. BlackRock ended its 31-day spot Bitcoin ETF inflow streak with its largest outflow on record, nearly $12.7 million more than its previous biggest outflow day. According to Farside data, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recorded its largest outflow of $430.8 million on May 30. The firm’s previous largest outflow day was on February 26, with $418.1 million in outflows. The 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded net outflows for the second consecutive day on May 30, totaling $616.1 million. The day prior, all BTC ETFs ended their 10-day net inflow streak with an outflow day of $346.8 million, despite BlackRock posting an inflow. “Every other issuer saw red. BlackRock kept buying … big brain energy right there. The selloff isn’t retail panic. It’s LITERALLY the quiet transfer of supply to the strongest hands.” – Kyle Chasse , Founder of Master Ventures. Derive founder Nick Forster argued on May 30 that there has been a significant amount of spot Bitcoin ETF inflows in recent times, yet it hasn’t been reflected in the spot price. He noted that despite significant inflows into BTC ETFs, with over $6.2 billion into IBIT, BTC’s price hasn’t experienced a commensurate rise. Data from CoinShares showed that ARK Invest and 21Shares’ crypto investment product saw the biggest losses among issuers last week, totaling $282 million and bringing YTD flows to $22 million of outflows.

CoinShares’ head of research, James Butterfill, noted that despite the inflows, total assets under management (AUM) declined from an all-time high of $187 billion to $177 billion by the weekend, triggered by uncertainty over U.S. tariffs. Ethereum ETPs last week recorded inflows totaling $321 million, marking the strongest run since late December 2024. Butterfill also argued that BTC ETPs saw $8 million in outflows after a major flow reversal following a New York Court decision to declare U.S. tariffs illegal.

2025-06-02T20:16:55,"Altcoins vs ETFs: Best Crypto Presales Before Retail Inflows?","In previous rallies, altcoins have outperformed ETFs in returns, making them attractive for high-risk, high-reward investors during the ongoing altseason shift. Bitcoin Pepe's launch of the PEP-20 standard on Bitcoin, combined with exchange listings and 30% bonus tokens, is driving strong presale momentum and investor excitement. The US SEC approved Bitcoin ETFs in October 2024, making them an integral part of the cryptocurrency market. Currently, the 12-spot and other strategy Bitcoin ETFs have collectively held above $131 billion in assets under management , one of history's most successful ETF launches. With Bitcoin, Ethereum ETFs have also been approved by the SEC and currently hold $10.21 billion in AUM. While what matters more for investors is return on their capital, most of the major BTC ETFs have delivered over 100% gains since their launch. The Bitcoin price has doubled since the start of 2024, and as major economies and institutions adopt Bitcoin, this number could reach significantly higher. In the same period, altcoins also performed exceptionally well, with some delivering gains of over 500%. This makes it challenging for investors to choose between ETFs and altcoins. Aggressive investors who want to make high returns can bet on the best fundamental altcoins like Bitcoin Pepe , a direct descendant of Bitcoin. In contrast, investors who want to play it conservatively can choose ETFs with a low-risk, low-reward system. Altseason is coming: What are the best crypto presales to buy before it's too late? As Bitcoin has hit a new all-time high, the altcoin markets are flashing early signs of a breakout, with prominent names calling for a potential altseason in the coming weeks. João Wedson, CEO of Alphractal , recently noted that Bitcoin's dominance is slowly dipping, and capital will flow into altcoins. He sees this trend as proof that altcoin season has already begun. His custom index, which tracks 57 handpicked altcoins, shows that 37 of them have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 60 days. Investors should take advantage of the progress of futuristic projects by investing in these top cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) is the only crypto presale that has made our list of top cryptocurrencies because of its strong fundamentals and real-world applications. As the first Bitcoin-based meme-centric ICO, Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) has attracted tremendous retail inflows, raising over $13.6m. The project has cultivated massive community support with its vision of building “Solana on Bitcoin” and providing an unmatched meme trading experience on the most trusted blockchain. Bitcoin Pepe developed a new token standard, PEP-20, that allows anyone to launch tokens permissionlessly and natively on the Bitcoin network. This new standard is breaking barriers for developers and providing a safe space for meme projects to thrive in the upcoming meme mania. The BPEP team has partnered with platforms like Plena Finance, BETV, GemuPlay, Catamoto, etc., to drive its adoption. These partnerships extend the token's utility beyond the Bitcoin Pepe ecosystem and provide real-world utility to users through cross-platform use cases. At the end of the presale, the team extended the purchase window and announced that they are working with multiple tier-1 exchanges to list the BPEP token. A massive $500,000 inflow within 24 hours of this announcement demonstrated the community's excitement about the listing. With the extension of the presale, Bitcoin Pepe has also distributed 30% extra tokens to all early investors, giving them a significant bonus. All the BPEP staking pools have been sold out, holding over 200 million tokens and providing up to 10,000% APYs to early adopters. Investors who missed out can still get BPEP at a discounted price, as it is available at $0.0396 in the final stage of the presale. The extended window will close soon, and the team will give a major announcement on June 17 regarding the final listing on CEXs. Ripple (XRP) The XRP price has increased substantially by over 600% since last November, after the resolution in the SEC Ripple case. Moreover, the optimism surrounding the imminent approval of XRP ETFs has driven whale transactions. According to Glassnode, the number of addresses holding 10,000+ $XRP has just surged past 300,000 — a strong signal of growing confidence and accumulation among larger holders. This uptick suggests that big players are positioning themselves for a potential upside, possibly… pic.twitter.com/3rU6URd44d — Henry (@LordOfAlts) May 4, 2025 On-chain analysis shows that XRP whales have accumulated over 880 million XRP tokens in April alone, and the number of crypto addresses holding at least 10k XRP has increased. The long-term bullish structure in XRP is a testament to their strong belief in Ripple’s future growth prospects. XRP hovers above the $2.10 support at press time, noting a flat movement in the last 24 hours. Ripple’s market appeal strengthens because institutions use it for global payment solutions, and the US government continues to embrace the platform. Many think this is only the start of the XRP price rally, with some claiming Ripple could hit $3 in June. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin price volatility has kept investors baffled for so long. What began as a mere joke now boasts a total market cap exceeding $28 billion. With celebrity endorsements and wild rallies, DOGE has become one of the most famous cryptocurrencies worldwide. At the time of writing, it is trading at $0.19. Image Courtesy: TradingView Technical analysis shows that this $0.1850 level is vital. Buyers looking for optimistic reversal patterns to start long positions could see this support for a possible bounce. On the other hand, sellers are probably seeking evidence to support a break below $0.1850, so they may lower the price even further. Bitcoin Pepe continues its impressive presale Right now, investor sentiment is at an all-time high, and as altcoin season approaches, small-cap gems such as Bitcoin Pepe are poised to make significant profits. Whale accumulations are showing bullish signs for XRP, but without a green flag for the XRP ETF, it is hard for Ripple to regain momentum. Dogecoin has also entered a correction mode and is searching for a strong support level. Bitcoin Pepe, on the other hand, boasts a solid narrative as a strong Bitcoin proxy with huge growth potential. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

2025-06-02T20:15:00,"Australia’s Bold Move: Taxing Bitcoin and Stocks on Unrealized Gains","Australia’s proposed tax on unrealized capital gains will impact assets above AUD 3 million. Bitcoin (BTC) holders will face a 15% tax on unrealized gains between 2025 and 2026. The tax will also apply to stocks like Strategy, raising concerns among investors. Australia is nearly ready to pass a tax on unrealized capital gains.

2025-06-02T20:10:55,"Astounding $286M Digital Asset Products Inflows Continue 7-Week Streak","BitcoinWorld Astounding $286M Digital Asset Products Inflows Continue 7-Week Streak In a significant show of market confidence, digital asset investment products have once again posted robust inflows, attracting a net total of $286 million over the past week. This impressive figure extends a remarkable streak, pushing the total inflows over the last seven weeks to a staggering $10.9 billion. This sustained interest, detailed in a recent Medium blog post by James Butterfill of CoinShares Research, underscores a prevailing positive sentiment in the crypto market, particularly among investors utilizing regulated investment vehicles like ETPs (Exchange Traded Products) and funds. What’s Driving Crypto Fund Inflows? The latest report from CoinShares highlights the continued appetite for digital assets, channelled through structured investment products. These products offer investors, particularly institutions and those seeking regulated access, a familiar way to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies without directly holding the underlying assets. The consistent inflows over the past seven weeks suggest that the recent price consolidation and upward movements have bolstered investor confidence, rather than leading to widespread profit-taking. Key data points from the CoinShares report: Total Weekly Inflows: $286 million Total Inflows Over 7 Weeks: $10.9 billion Leading Asset (Past Week): Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum Weekly Inflows: $321 million Bitcoin Weekly Flow: $8 million outflows Source: CoinShares Research (James Butterfill) While the overall picture is overwhelmingly positive with significant Crypto Fund Inflows , a closer look reveals interesting shifts in investor preference within the digital asset space. Ethereum Investment Takes the Lead Breaking down the weekly figures, Ethereum (ETH) emerged as the star performer, attracting a substantial $321 million in inflows. This marked a significant shift from recent weeks where Bitcoin typically dominated the inflow charts. The strong interest in Ethereum Investment could be attributed to several factors: Anticipation surrounding potential future upgrades or developments within the Ethereum ecosystem. Market rotation as investors look for opportunities in large-cap altcoins after significant runs in Bitcoin. Increased activity and interest in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT sectors, which primarily reside on the Ethereum network. Growing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition as the leading smart contract platform. This surge in ETH-focused products indicates a diversifying trend within the market, where investors are increasingly comfortable allocating capital beyond just Bitcoin. Understanding the Nuances of Bitcoin Investment While the overall inflow number is high, the report noted a temporary shift in momentum for Bitcoin (BTC) mid-week, resulting in minor outflows totaling $8 million by the week’s end. This doesn’t necessarily signal a bearish turn for Bitcoin Investment but rather could reflect: Some investors taking profits after Bitcoin’s strong performance in previous weeks. A temporary rotation of capital into Ethereum and other altcoins, seeking higher potential short-term gains. Specific trading strategies employed by institutions or large investors using these products. Despite this small weekly outflow, Bitcoin products still account for the vast majority of the $10.9 billion accumulated over the past seven weeks, underscoring its continued dominance as the primary gateway for institutional crypto exposure. What CoinShares Data Tells Us About Market Sentiment? The consistent inflow trend, as highlighted by the latest CoinShares Data , serves as a powerful indicator of current market sentiment. A seven-week streak of positive inflows, culminating in nearly $11 billion, suggests strong underlying demand and confidence among investors accessing the market via regulated products. This level of sustained inflow hasn’t been seen for a considerable period and points towards: Increased Institutional Adoption: Regulated products are often the preferred route for institutional players, suggesting growing participation from larger funds and wealth managers. Positive Market Outlook: Investors are seemingly buying the dips and adding to positions, indicating a belief that the current price levels represent opportunities rather than peaks. Maturity of the Market: The availability and popularity of these investment vehicles reflect the increasing maturity and accessibility of the digital asset class. While individual weekly flows can fluctuate between assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the overarching trend of significant net inflows into the sector remains a compelling narrative. Benefits and Challenges of Investing via Digital Asset Products Investing in cryptocurrencies through Digital Asset Products offers several benefits: Accessibility: Easier access for traditional investors and institutions. Regulation: Products are often regulated, providing a layer of oversight. Custody: Removes the burden of self-custody for the investor. However, challenges exist: Fees: These products typically charge management fees. Tracking Error: The product’s performance may not perfectly mirror the underlying asset. Limited Options: Product availability may be limited compared to direct market access. Despite these points, the continued inflows indicate that for many investors, the benefits outweigh the challenges, making these products a preferred method for gaining exposure. Actionable Insights from the Inflow Data For investors watching the market, the latest CoinShares Data provides valuable insights: Broad Market Strength: The overall $10.9 billion inflow signals strong underlying demand for the crypto asset class as a whole. Potential for Rotation: Ethereum’s strong performance this week suggests potential investor rotation into large-cap altcoins. While Bitcoin saw minor outflows, its dominance over the streak indicates its foundational role. Sentiment Indicator: Sustained inflows via regulated products are a positive long-term sentiment indicator, pointing towards increasing mainstream acceptance and investment. Keeping an eye on these inflow trends can help investors gauge market sentiment and potential areas of interest within the digital asset ecosystem. Conclusion: A Streak of Confidence The digital asset market continues its impressive run of positive inflows into investment products, extending the streak to seven weeks and accumulating nearly $11 billion. While Bitcoin saw a slight pause with minor outflows last week, the significant $321 million inflow into Ethereum products highlights diversifying investor interest and strength in the broader market. The sustained flow of capital into these regulated vehicles, as reported by CoinShares, is a strong testament to growing institutional and mainstream confidence in the digital asset class, painting a bullish picture for the sector’s near-term trajectory.

NLH is led by Gin Chao, an independent Board member of Binance.US and former Strategy Officer of Binance.com , and was founded on the mission to accelerate value creation through blockchain technology globally. The firm launched CVP NoLimit Fund I (Fund I) in 2022, which invested into 40+ projects and has significantly outperformed Bitcoin with top decile DPI (distributed to paid-in capital) and MOIC (multiple on invested capital) metrics to date. This performance was achieved through disciplined underwriting into the fast-evolving infrastructure and DeFi landscapes as well as new sectors such as DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure networks). Fund I led the pre-seed round of Wynd Labs, a core contributor to Grass Protocol, one of the most successful DePIN projects developed to date. Grass allows users to earn rewards by sharing their unused internet bandwidth and verified institutions to access public web data through the network. Fund I also supported new L1s, Sei and Sui, as well as next-generation synthetic stablecoin Ethena. “NLH backed us when Grass was just an idea.

2025-06-02T20:00:55,"Bitcoin Price: Unlocking Crucial Market Trends This Week","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price: Unlocking Crucial Market Trends This Week Understanding the forces at play in the cryptocurrency market is essential for anyone holding or considering investing in digital assets. This week, the spotlight remains firmly on Bitcoin (BTC), the undisputed king of crypto. Following a significant period of price action, several key indicators and external factors are converging, potentially signaling the next major move for the flagship cryptocurrency. Staying informed on these crucial Bitcoin market trends is vital for navigating the volatile landscape. Our latest Bitcoin analysis dives deep into five pivotal factors that traders and investors should be closely monitoring. From technical signals on the charts to macroeconomic influences and the movements of large holders, these elements provide valuable insights into the potential trajectory of the Bitcoin price in the coming days. Let’s break down what’s happening. Understanding Bitcoin Price Action: The RSI Signal One of the most widely followed technical indicators in the world of trading, including for Bitcoin , is the Relative Strength Index (RSI). This momentum oscillator measures the speed and change of price movements. It typically ranges from 0 to 100. Readings above 70 usually suggest an asset is overbought, while readings below 30 indicate it might be oversold. However, the story gets more nuanced when we talk about divergence. Recently, Bitcoin experienced a record monthly close, a bullish sign in itself. Yet, this strong price performance has been accompanied by what some analysts are pointing to as RSI divergence. A bearish divergence occurs when the price makes a higher high, but the RSI makes a lower high. This pattern can suggest that the upward momentum is weakening, even as the price continues to climb. It’s like the engine is starting to lose power even though the car is still accelerating. Why is this important? Divergence, particularly after a strong rally or a significant price milestone like a record close, can act as a cautionary signal. It doesn’t guarantee a price reversal, but it does suggest that the buying pressure might be waning and that a slowdown or even a correction could be on the horizon. For those performing crypto market analysis , spotting these divergences is a key part of anticipating potential shifts in trend direction. Key Takeaway: While Bitcoin’s price remains robust, the potential bearish RSI divergence is a technical indicator suggesting traders should exercise caution and watch for signs of weakening momentum. Macro Forces Shaping Crypto Market Analysis: US Fed and Labor Data The cryptocurrency market, despite its decentralized nature, is increasingly influenced by traditional macroeconomic factors, especially those originating from the United States. This week, attention is heavily focused on U.S. labor market data and the subsequent implications for Federal Reserve monetary policy. Why does this matter for Bitcoin news? The Fed’s primary tools are interest rates and quantitative easing/tightening. When the labor market is strong (low unemployment, rising wages), it can signal potential inflation. To combat inflation, the Fed typically raises interest rates. Higher interest rates make traditional, safer investments like bonds more attractive compared to riskier assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a weakening labor market might give the Fed reason to pause or even cut rates, which can be bullish for risk assets. Upcoming labor data releases, such as non-farm payrolls and unemployment rates, will provide crucial clues about the health of the U.S. economy. If the data is stronger than expected, it could lead to expectations of the Fed keeping rates higher for longer, potentially putting downward pressure on the Bitcoin price . If the data is weaker, it might increase hopes for rate cuts, which could be a positive catalyst. Moreover, commentary from Federal Reserve officials throughout the week will be scrutinized for any hints about their future policy intentions. Their words can significantly impact market sentiment across all asset classes, including crypto. Actionable Insight: Keep a close eye on U.S. economic calendar releases, particularly labor data, and any statements from Federal Reserve members. These events can trigger volatility in the Bitcoin market trends . Tracking Bitcoin Market Trends: Stablecoin Flows and Sentiment Stablecoins play a critical role in the crypto ecosystem, acting as a bridge between volatile cryptocurrencies and traditional fiat currencies. They are often used by traders to move in and out of positions quickly without converting back to fiat. Analyzing stablecoin movements on exchanges can offer valuable insights into market sentiment. A significant trend observed recently is the outflow of over $1 billion in stablecoins from the Binance exchange. Binance is one of the largest crypto exchanges globally, so large movements there can be indicative of broader market sentiment. When stablecoins flow onto exchanges, it often suggests traders are bringing capital in, ready to buy volatile assets like Bitcoin. Conversely, when stablecoins flow off exchanges, it can signal a ‘risk-off’ sentiment. What does ‘risk-off’ mean in this context? It means market participants are potentially reducing their exposure to volatile assets. They might be cashing out into stablecoins to sit on the sidelines during uncertain times, or they might be moving those stablecoins off-exchange to hold them securely or deploy them elsewhere (though large outflows often suggest a desire to exit volatile positions). This large outflow suggests a significant amount of capital that was potentially ready to buy or was recently holding stable value on the exchange has now left, indicating reduced immediate buying pressure or increased caution among a large group of users. This trend aligns with a potential pause or pullback scenario, reinforcing some of the technical signals like the RSI divergence. It’s a tangible sign of market participants reacting to current conditions by reducing risk. Observation: Large stablecoin outflows from major exchanges like Binance often point towards a cautious or ‘risk-off’ sentiment prevailing in the market, which can impact the immediate Bitcoin price outlook. Bitcoin Analysis: What Whale Activity Tells Us In the world of crypto, ‘whales’ are entities or individuals holding a significant amount of a particular cryptocurrency. Their movements can have a disproportionate impact on market prices due to the sheer volume of their transactions. Tracking whale activity is a key component of sophisticated Bitcoin analysis . Recent data indicates that some whales have started engaging in profit-taking. After a substantial rally in the Bitcoin price , it’s natural for long-term holders or those who bought at lower prices to realize some gains. Profit-taking involves selling a portion of their holdings, converting it into stablecoins or fiat. While some degree of profit-taking is healthy and expected after a rally, a significant increase in whale selling can add selling pressure to the market. Analysts watch on-chain data closely to distinguish between minor distribution and large-scale selling that could signal a potential top or a deeper correction. Tools that track whale wallets and exchange flows are essential for this type of monitoring. The fact that whales are beginning to take profits suggests they may see the current price levels as opportune for exiting positions or reducing risk. This doesn’t necessarily mean they are bearish long-term, but it indicates a potential pause or a need for the market to absorb this selling pressure before moving higher. Insight: Whale profit-taking adds selling pressure and is a sign that large holders may believe current price levels represent a good opportunity to realize gains, impacting short-term Bitcoin market trends . Bitcoin Price Prediction Factors: Profitability and Potential Targets Beyond technical indicators and market participant behavior, on-chain metrics related to profitability also offer clues about the market’s state and potential future moves. One such metric looks at the percentage of Bitcoin supply currently in a state of profit (meaning the current price is higher than the price at which the coins were last moved). Historically, when a very high percentage of the Bitcoin supply is in profit, it can sometimes precede periods of increased selling pressure as more holders have an incentive to realize gains. However, high profitability also reflects a strong upward trend and overall positive sentiment. Some analysts are pointing to the current profitability levels, combined with other factors, as potentially leading Bitcoin toward a local top around the $120,000 mark. It’s crucial to understand that ‘local top’ doesn’t necessarily mean the absolute peak of a bull cycle. It suggests a potential temporary high point where the price might consolidate, pull back, or face significant resistance before potentially attempting to move higher later. Price targets like $120,000 are often derived from various models, historical patterns, or extensions of previous price movements. While such targets can be exciting, they should be viewed as possibilities based on certain conditions holding true, rather than guaranteed outcomes. The path to any target is rarely a straight line and is subject to the interplay of all the factors discussed above. Perspective: High on-chain profitability is typical of a strong market but can also increase the likelihood of profit-taking. The potential for Bitcoin to target $120,000 is an optimistic outlook based on certain models, but it would likely represent a significant resistance level or a ‘local top’ where price action could become challenging. Bringing It All Together: What to Watch This Week Navigating the crypto market analysis landscape this week requires a careful balancing act. On one hand, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable strength, reaching significant milestones. On the other hand, several signals suggest caution is warranted. Technical Signals: The potential RSI divergence highlights weakening momentum despite price strength. Macro Headwinds: Upcoming U.S. labor data and Fed commentary could introduce volatility based on inflation and interest rate expectations. Sentiment Check: Large stablecoin outflows from major exchanges signal a clear ‘risk-off’ sentiment among a segment of the market. Whale Movements: Whales beginning to take profits add potential selling pressure that the market needs to absorb. Profitability & Targets: High on-chain profitability could incentivize more selling, while ambitious price targets like $120K represent significant potential resistance zones. These five factors are not operating in isolation. They interact and influence each other. For example, negative macro news could exacerbate risk-off sentiment, leading to further stablecoin outflows and potentially more whale selling. Conversely, positive developments could override these cautionary signals. For investors and traders, the key this week is vigilance. Pay close attention to how the market reacts to the incoming U.S. data. Monitor on-chain metrics for changes in whale behavior and stablecoin flows. Observe how the Bitcoin price interacts with key support and resistance levels, especially if the RSI divergence plays out. Conclusion: Navigating Uncertainty with Informed Bitcoin Analysis The path forward for the Bitcoin price this week appears to be at a critical juncture. While the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains bullish for many, the short-to-medium term presents a complex picture influenced by technical signals, macroeconomic forces, and significant market participant behavior. The potential for a slowdown indicated by RSI, combined with risk-off signals from stablecoin flows and whale activity, suggests that navigating the market requires careful consideration. Staying informed about these crucial Bitcoin market trends , coupled with a sound understanding of your own risk tolerance and investment goals, is paramount. Whether these factors lead to a temporary pullback or simply a period of consolidation before the next move, being aware of the potential headwinds and tailwinds allows for more informed decision-making in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.

2025-06-02T19:55:54,"Meta Shareholders Vote To Shut Down Bitcoin Treasury Proposal in Near-Unanimous Decision","Shareholders at Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta have decided to shoot down a proposed Bitcoin ( BTC ) treasury for the tech giant. According to an 8-K Filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from last week, the vast majority of Meta shareholders voted against a BTC treasury proposal as a hedge against inflation. “On May 28, 2025, Meta Platforms, Inc. (the “Company”) held its annual meeting of shareholders via live audio webcast… At the Annual Meeting, the Company’s shareholders voted on fourteen proposals, each of which is described in more detail in the Company’s definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 17, 2025… At the beginning of the Annual Meeting, there were 1,769,720,699 shares of Class A common stock and 342,865,499 shares of Class B common stock present or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting, which represented 92.61% of the combined voting power of the shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting (voting together as a single class), and which constituted a quorum for the transaction of business.” According to the filing, 3.9 million shares voted for the proposed treasury, while 4.9 billion shares voted it down. Since founder Mark Zuckerberg controls approximately 60% of the shares, it can be reasonably assumed that Zuckerberg voted against the measure. Despite the BTC Treasury vote, Meta is still reportedly eyeing a venture into stablecoins amid growing interest and demand for digital assets.

2025-06-02T19:53:22,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: $104K in Play, $109K Target Looms Amid Global Shakeups","Bitcoin is trading at $104,434, down 0.55% over the last 24 hours, with a trading volume topping $43 billion. This follows a wave of bold announcements—and abrupt clarifications—coming from Pakistan’s top officials. Bilal Bin Saqib, a special assistant to the Prime Minister, revealed plans at Bitcoin Vegas 2025 to create a national Bitcoin reserve and state-backed wallet. The initiative aimed to repurpose 2,000 megawatts of excess electricity for AI data centers and Bitcoin mining—a bold play to attract global investors. Pakistan’s govt within 20 hours: 1. “We have a Bitcoin reserve!” 2. “Crypto is still illegal.” Zero coherence. Zero accountability. Kya مسلط kar diya hai Pakistan par. pic.twitter.com/qxZKasHdsw — Sikander Fayyaz Bhadera (@SikanderFayyaz) May 30, 2025 But celebrations were short-lived. Just days later, Pakistan’s Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal denied any official shift in crypto policy. He emphasized that cryptocurrencies remain illegal unless formally approved by the government. This contradiction has caused confusion, especially as Pakistan’s newly formed Digital Assets Authority aims to align policies with global standards, including FATF compliance. Bitcoin Reserve Chaos: Pakistan’s Big Reveal Crushed by Own Government https://t.co/gQ9uET4spN — Metatron Apps-OTC $MRNJ (@MetatronInc) June 2, 2025 While Saqib’s proposal sparked enthusiasm, critics—especially from the IMF—flagged concerns about energy use and financial risks. In the short term, mixed signals from the government have sparked both optimism and skepticism. However, Pakistan’s steps toward structured regulation point to longer-term opportunities for Bitcoin’s integration. Czech Minister Resigns Over $45M Bitcoin Scandal The crypto world was rocked when Czech Justice Minister Pavel Blazek stepped down after it emerged that his ministry sold nearly $45 million in Bitcoin, donated by convicted drug trafficker Tomas Jirikovsky. Intended to fund prison projects and digital justice reforms, the funds were accepted without proper vetting, under the assumption that Jirikovsky was trying to make amends. Czech Justice Minister resigns over $45M Bitcoin donation tied to convicted criminal. Now under police probe for possible money laundering. pic.twitter.com/csPVW42nWm — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) May 31, 2025 When it was revealed that the Bitcoin originated from the notorious dark web platform, Sheep Marketplace, public outrage erupted. Despite impending elections, Blazek resigned, and an investigation is now underway. Although this scandal has dampened sentiment, the Czech Republic’s broader move to align with the EU’s MiCA framework might restore investor confidence in the long run. South Korea’s Crypto Industry Could Win Big, Regardless of Election Outcome In South Korea, more than 18 million people actively participate in crypto markets. With the June 3 snap presidential election approaching, both frontrunners—Lee Jae-myung and Kim Moon-soo—have pledged support for crypto-friendly policies. NO MATTER WHO WINS SOUTH KOREA'S ELECTION TOMORROW, #CRYPTO WINS! BOTH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ARE PRO-DIGITAL ASSETS. pic.twitter.com/5jcvBj2JxR — The Moon Show (@TheMoonShow) June 2, 2025 Lee’s proposals include legalizing spot Bitcoin ETFs, introducing a won-backed stablecoin, and allowing the national pension fund to invest in crypto. Kim has similarly championed ETF approval and regulatory easing. This rare bipartisan alignment reflects growing public demand and positions South Korea as a crypto hub in the making. Regardless of who wins, legal clarity and institutional support could drive long-term adoption and fuel Bitcoin’s price growth. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: A Breakout to $109K or Reversal? On the charts, Bitcoin is navigating a descending wedge pattern on the 2-hour timeframe—a setup that often precedes a bullish reversal. Resistance looms at $105,352, aligning with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement and the 50-period EMA. Candlestick patterns near $104,514 (23.6% Fibonacci) suggest market indecision, with the MACD histogram narrowing and signal lines converging—signs of waning bearish momentum. If Bitcoin breaks decisively above $105,352 with solid volume, it could climb toward $106,719 (61.8% Fibonacci) and even target $109,000 in the coming sessions. However, failure to break through could send prices back toward $103,149 or even $101,275. Long Setup: Buy on a confirmed breakout above $105,352, target $106,719–$109K, stop below $104,514. Short Setup: Enter on rejection at $105,352, target $103,149–$101,275, stop above $105,500. Patience is essential—wait for clear price action and volume confirmation before making your move.

2025-06-02T19:43:45,"XAUUSD weekly forecast: $3600 next target for gold?","Last week, Donald Trump’s delay on European tariffs marked the return of the bullish rally on gold, and this week, the escalation of war between Ukraine and Russia, has further brought buying pressure in gold. Gold is now comfortably trading over $3350, and aiming for $3400 and possibly a new all-time high above $3500 as well. Table of Contents Previous week’s forecast recap of crypto.news Key economic events of this week Gold HTF Overview Gold Forecast for June 2nd to June 6th Trading Strategies & Investment Recommendation Similar to last week, the bias is gold is buy, upon retracement to specific levels. Let’s discuss the key pivot levels for gold buying and selling in this XAUUSD weekly forecast of June 2nd to June 6th, 2025. Previous week’s forecast recap of crypto.news In the previous week’s forecast we gave a 4h zone as high probability for buys, which was from $3260-$3208. Price is now up 1100 points from that zone and has the potential to run to $3400 and beyond. XAUUSD 4h chart – Source: Tradingview Other levels shared in the last week’s forecast have not hit yet, but they remain valid, so do keep an eye out for them as well. Now let’s start by discussing the key economic events of this week and their possible impact on the price of XAUUSD. Key economic events of this week Some significant U.S. economic reports are scheduled for release this week that are expected to impact XAUUSD . Monday, June 2nd ISM Manufacturing PMI A higher-than-expected PMI may strengthen the USD and put downward pressure on gold. Gold prices would probably be supported by a weak reading. Fed Chair Powell Speaks Powell may suggest aggressive policy or rate rises, which would cause the USD to rise and drive gold lower. Usually, gold would be lifted by dovish remarks. Tuesday, June 3 Job Openings at JOLTS Increased job vacancies indicate a strong labor market, which would strengthen the USD and depress gold. Lower values might have the reverse effect. Wednesday, June 4 ADP Non-Farm Employment Change Strong ADP data indicates labor strength, which weighs on gold and increases the USD. On the basis of recession fears, a miss might lead to gold buying. ISM Services PMI Excellent services PMI supports bearish gold sentiment, optimistic USD sentiment, and economic resilience. The demand for gold is supported by a lower reading. Thursday, June 5 Unemployment Claims Gold may suffer from fewer claims, which show the strength of labor. Growing claims may indicate economic strain and raise the price of gold. Friday, June 6 Average Hourly Earnings m/m Increased salaries indicate inflationary pressure, which could lead to Fed tightening bets (bearish on gold, bullish on the USD). Non-Farm Employment Change Gold declines and the dollar rises when the NFP report is strong. Weak numbers increase recession fears and are frequently positive for gold. Unemployment Rate A decrease in unemployment is both good for the USD and bad for gold. Gold as a safe haven is usually supported by an increase.

XAUUSD 1w chart – Source: Tradingview Gold Forecast for June 2nd to June 6th Gold is showing bullish momentum in all lower time frames which makes buying an ideal position to enter and hold. In the 1 hour timeframe the strongest buying level is coming up at the weekly open, opening gap, and 1 hour structure level of $3303-3295.

Twenty One Capital (XXI) stands out as a new Bitcoin investment company founded in collaboration with giants such as Cantor Fitzgerald, SoftBank, Tether and Bitfinex. The company’s main strategy is to buy large amounts of Bitcoin and hold it for the long term.

2025-06-02T19:41:35,"Meta, Microsoft and Amazon reject Bitcoin: Was this the right call?","Just 0.1% of Meta shareholders backed a proposal to add Bitcoin to its treasury, joining Amazon and Microsoft in making similar decisions. Here’s what investors are saying. Meta’s decisive shareholder vote rejected the idea of adding Bitcoin (BTC) to its balance sheet, aligning with similar moves by Microsoft and Amazon in similar decisions. According to an SEC filing , just 0.1% of shareholders voted in favor, while 95% voted against. For some, this suggests that tech firms are still lagging in Bitcoin adoption. For one, Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, believes tech firms are missing out . He pointed out that Meta’s large cash positions are already speculative. If the dollar falls, so will their cash reserves, and Bitcoin could serve as a way to diversify. “They are already hoarding fiat with $30B in cash, up from $12B in 2023,” Matthew Sigel, VanEck. Sigel acknowledged that this accounts for just 2% of Meta’s market cap. However, other companies—including Netflix, Google, and Verizon, hold fewer reserves, and some even carry significant amounts of debt.

Bitcoin is not gaining traction among major firms Bitcoin has recently gained attention as with more and more companies increased their positions. One of them is GameStop, which invested $519 million in BTC. However, as many have pointed out, most of the companies doing big Bitcoin plays tend to struggle in their core business, with GameStop being no exception . In many cases, these companies are hoping that speculative interest around Bitcoin could boost their stock price. However, in GameStop’s case, the success was momentary, with its share price falling from a high of $35 shortly after the acquisition. For successful businesses like Meta, Bitcoin is a less compelling buy. For Meta investors, including investment giants like BlackRock, Vanguard, and Fidelity, traditional risk management is sufficient. On the other hand, Bitcoin is still seen as too risky to hold.

Analyst Says Wait For This To Happen First","Dogecoin has dipped below $0.2 as part of a broader crypto market correction, providing a buying opportunity for investors. However, crypto analyst DecyX had indicated that investors should wait for this to happen before they accumulate the foremost meme coin. Analyst Reveals What To Wait For Before Buying Dogecoin In an X post , DecyX told investors to wait for Dogecoin to grab the liquidity under $0.187 before accumulating the meme coin. He added that they should look for bullish price action on the lower timeframes (LTFs) and target the imbalance zone between $0.213 and $0.215. The analyst believes that a full fill could send DOGE to above $0.235. DecyX also noted that the Fair Value Gap (FVG) above is still untouched and that the $0.2597 strong high is a magnet long-term for Dogecoin. His statements come just as the meme coin dropped below the psychological $0.2 level. This price decline has occurred following the Bitcoin price correction from its all-time high (ATH) recorded two weeks ago. In an X post , crypto analyst Kevin Capital told Dogecoin holders that they want to see the meme coin hold onto between $0.1901 and $0.1839. His accompanying chart showed that failure to hold between this range could send DOGE to as low as $0.17. The analyst has on several occasions drawn the correlation between the Dogecoin and Bitcoin price. In another X post , he commented on the Bitcoin price and warned that things could get “sketchy” for the flagship crypto, meaning that DOGE is also at risk. Kevin Capital noted that the weekly close for Bitcoin was below $106,800, which puts it back in the danger zone. The analyst remarked that it needs to return above that level within the coming days to avoid things becoming sketchy. DOGE Could Be Bottoming Out In an X post , crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade stated that Dogecoin could be forming a double bottom on the 4-hour chart. His chart showed that he expects a reversal from the $0.18 zone, with the meme coin rallying back above the psychological $0.2 zone . The analyst also alluded to Dogecoin’s daily chart , revealing a hidden Bullish Divergence on DOGE’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) . He stated that the meme coin is creating a higher low on the daily chart, while its RSI shows a lower low. Meanwhile, the analyst revealed that Dogecoin is breaking out from a Symmetrical triangle on the 1-hour chart. A breakout from this triangle is also expected to send the meme coin above the $0.2 level. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.1906, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/the-dogecoin-dip-below-0-2/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Dogecoin|bitcoin|Bullish Divergence|Coinmarketcap|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Double Bottom|Fair Value Gap|FVG|Kevin Capital|meme coin|relative strength index|RSI|Trader Tardigrade",cryptocompare
2025-06-02T19:25:48,"Bitcoin structurally strong despite major pullback: Bitfinex analysts","Bitcoin has seen a major pullback from its all-time high of $111,880, as a macroeconomic reversal wipes out futures traders. Bitcoin ( BTC ) remains strong after a pullback from a major rally, states a report by Bitfinex analysts, released on Monday, June 2. After reaching its all-time high of $111,880 with a 50% rally in just 45 days, the asset has encountered significant macroeconomic pressure. Notably, reinstated tariffs resulted in a sharp spike in Treasury yields, with 30-year Treasury yields rising above 5 percent. These factors are fueling risk-off sentiment, which is affecting both stocks and Bitcoin. Moreover, the Bitcoin derivatives market, Bitfinex analysts explain, is likely overheated. Still, the report suggests that Bitcoin remains in a strong position. “Despite the pullback, we believe Bitcoin remains structurally strong. This correction appears to be a healthy reset rather than a breakdown—driven by leverage flushing and profit realisation after one of the sharpest recoveries in crypto history,” Bitfinex report. You might also like: Bitcoin ETFs ended six-week inflow streak over macro jitters and BTC slump Bitcoin faces macro uncertainty, profit taking Bitfinex analysts note that open interest rose to an all-time high of $49.4 billion, indicating that traders are increasingly hedging their bets and speculating on the asset. In both cases, this suggests that traders are anticipating more volatility. You might also like: Will Bitcoin and altcoins rise in June, or is a new crypto winter coming?

2025-06-02T19:20:55,"Korean Crypto Community: Unveiling Top Tokens Searched and Discussed","BitcoinWorld Korean Crypto Community: Unveiling Top Tokens Searched and Discussed The world of cryptocurrency moves at lightning speed, and staying informed about where interest is surging is crucial for anyone navigating the market. While global trends often dominate headlines, regional insights, especially from highly active markets like South Korea, can offer unique perspectives. This is where understanding the pulse of the Korean crypto community becomes invaluable. We’ve tapped into exclusive data from Bitcoin World to bring you a snapshot of the tokens that captured the most attention within the South Korean crypto community during the week of May 23 to 29. By analyzing both search volume and mentions, we can gain a clearer picture of what’s driving curiosity and conversation among Korean investors and enthusiasts. Why Understanding South Korea Crypto Trends Matters South Korea has long been recognized as a significant player in the global cryptocurrency market. Its tech-savvy population, high internet penetration, and enthusiastic adoption of digital technologies have made it a hotbed for crypto trading and innovation. Trends originating or gaining traction within the country can sometimes foreshadow broader market movements or highlight specific projects gaining serious momentum. Monitoring South Korea crypto trends provides valuable intelligence for investors worldwide. Top Searched Crypto Korea: What Were Investors Looking For? Curiosity often starts with a search. The tokens with the highest search volumes indicate which projects or assets people are actively researching, likely driven by recent news, price movements, or general interest. Here’s what the data revealed for the week: Rank Token Search Volume 1 XRP 38,370 2 ETH 18,054 3 BTC 16,025 4 SOPH 9,159 5 SUI 8,660 6 ONDO 8,147 7 MOVE 5,537 8 SOL 5,461 9 EOS 4,079 10 NXPC 3,991 XRP stands out significantly, nearly doubling the search volume of the second-place token, Ethereum (ETH). This suggests ongoing strong interest, perhaps related to legal developments or community anticipation. ETH and BTC maintain their positions as foundational assets, consistently ranking high. What’s particularly interesting are the newer or less globally prominent tokens like SOPH, SUI, ONDO, MOVE, EOS, and NXPC making the top searched crypto Korea list, indicating specific regional interest or recent developments within those projects resonating with the Korean audience. K-Community Crypto Buzz: What Were They Discussing? Beyond just searching for information, what are people actively talking about? Mention data reflects ongoing discussions, sentiment, and community engagement around specific tokens. Here’s the list of the most mentioned tokens in the K-community crypto space: Rank Token Mentions 1 BTC 1,415 2 ETH 603 3 TRUMP 293 4 XRP 170 5 SOL 159 6 SUI 99 7 VIRTUAL 45 8 NXPC 44 9 PEPE 39 10 ONDO 38 Interestingly, while XRP dominated searches, BTC and ETH lead the mention count, suggesting they are central to broader market discussions and sentiment analysis. The appearance of the TRUMP token at number three is notable, indicating that politically linked or meme-style tokens can generate significant discussion volume, even if search interest isn’t as high. Other tokens like SOL, SUI, NXPC, PEPE, and ONDO also feature in discussions, mirroring some of the search trends but with different relative prominence. Comparing Search vs. Mention: What Does It Tell Us? The differences between the search and mention lists offer valuable insights: High Search, Lower Mention (e.g., XRP, SOPH, MOVE, EOS): People are actively seeking information. This could be due to recent news, potential investment opportunities they are researching, or trying to understand a project. The conversation might be happening elsewhere or is less consolidated in the monitored K-Community channels. High Mention, Lower Search (e.g., TRUMP, VIRTUAL, PEPE): These tokens are generating buzz and discussion, possibly driven by social media trends, specific events, or their nature as speculative or community-driven assets. The conversation itself might be the primary driver of interest, rather than in-depth research. Consistent High Ranking (e.g., BTC, ETH, SUI, ONDO, NXPC): These tokens are both being actively researched and discussed, indicating sustained and broad interest within the community. This comparison highlights that search volume often reflects initial or specific information-seeking behavior, while mentions indicate active community engagement and sentiment around a token. What Drove Interest in These Tokens Last Week? Pinpointing the exact reasons for the surge in interest for each token during this specific week (May 23-29) would require deeper analysis of news and events surrounding each project during that period. However, based on the Bitcoin World data , we can infer that factors likely included: Recent price volatility or significant price movements. Major project updates, partnerships, or roadmap milestones. Listing announcements on popular exchanges. General market sentiment influencing interest in major assets like BTC and ETH. Social media trends and community hype, especially for tokens like TRUMP and PEPE. Understanding these drivers is key to interpreting the data beyond just the numbers. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor So, how can you use this information about the Korean crypto community ‘s focus? Sentiment Gauge: High mention volume can indicate strong community sentiment, positive or negative. Identifying Potential Movers: Tokens appearing high on both lists, or showing a significant jump in search/mentions, might be worth researching further. Regional Nuances: This data highlights tokens with potentially stronger interest in the Korean market compared to global averages. Starting Point for Research: If a token you weren’t tracking appears high on these lists, it’s a signal to investigate why. Remember, this data is a snapshot from one week and one platform. It’s a valuable piece of the puzzle, but should be combined with broader market analysis and fundamental research. Conclusion: A Window into Korean Crypto Sentiment The Bitcoin World data for May 23-29 offers a fascinating look into the minds of the Korean crypto community . XRP’s dominance in searches, the consistent focus on BTC and ETH in discussions, and the emergence of specific altcoins and meme tokens paint a picture of a dynamic and engaged market. By tracking what this influential community is searching for and discussing, investors can gain valuable insights into potential trends and sentiment shifts. Staying informed about regional dynamics like these is crucial in the fast-paced world of crypto.

2025-06-02T19:12:18,"CertiK Says $302M Lost to Web3 Scams, Hacks, and Exploits in May","Blockchain security firm CertiK has released its May 2025 Security Report, revealing that over $302 million was lost across Web3 through scams, hacks, and exploits. While the overall losses marked a 16.94% decrease from April’s $364 million, one attack vector—code vulnerability—saw a dramatic surge. In May alone, $229.6 million was lost due to flawed code, a 4,483% increase from April’s $5 million. This vulnerability category became the top incident loss contributor, accounting for the majority of stolen funds. #CertiKStatsAlert Combining all the incidents in May we’ve confirmed ~$140.1M lost to exploits, hacks and scams after ~$162m was frozen. ~$8.5M of the total is attributed to phishing. More details below pic.twitter.com/LTE6axKeGi — CertiK Alert (@CertiKAlert) June 2, 2025 CertiK Senior Blockchain Security Researcher Natalie Newson emphasized the gravity of this spike, noting that although losses from code vulnerabilities had been declining in recent years, from $1.35 billion in 2021 to $173 million in 2024, May’s figure shows an urgent need for heightened code auditing and formal verification processes. Newson stresses that the rise shows how even mature areas of the space must remain vigilant, employing both human and AI-driven security protocols. Phishing and DeFi-Related Incidents Dominate Web3 Phishing scams , which had accounted for a large portion of April’s losses, saw a steep drop. In May, phishing-related incidents totaled $47.6 million—an 85% decrease from April’s $337 million. Despite the decline, phishing remained the second-most costly attack vector after code vulnerabilities, followed by private key compromises ($11.6 million) and price manipulation attacks ($1 million). DeFi platforms remained the most-targeted sector, experiencing losses of over $241 million in May. This reflects a broader trend of DeFi being a prime target for hackers due to its open-source nature and large pools of capital. Social engineering scams accounted for $35.5 million in losses, while exchanges and wallet drainers lost $11.1 million and $8.5 million, respectively. Cetus Hack Among the Month’s Major Incidents Among the nine major incidents identified in May, the most devastating was the attack on Cetus, which resulted in $225.6 million in stolen assets. Other breaches included Cork Protocol ($11.9 million), BittoPro ($11.1 million), Mobius DAO ($2.1 million), and Demex Nitron ($950,599). CertiK’s latest report is a stark reminder of the persistent and evolving threats within the Web3 ecosystem. As attackers refine their strategies, so too must the security measures designed to defend against them. Hacks and Scams in April Due to Phishing and Social Engineering Phishing accounted for the lion’s share of April’s losses, approximately $337 million. The standout case was the theft from an elderly U.S. investor , where the attacker used highly advanced social engineering tactics to deceive the victim and gain access to their Bitcoin wallet. According to CertiK, this event marks a new wave of cybercrime, where criminals bypass code and blockchain infrastructure entirely, opting instead to exploit human behavior. Social engineering, a tactic that manipulates people into revealing confidential information, has become one of the most effective strategies for crypto criminals. These attacks are particularly insidious because they often appear legitimate, tricking even experienced investors.

2025-06-02T19:12:05,"Crypto Exec Compares Bitcoin To Gold, Sees Bullish June for BTC","Charles Edwards, founder of the Capriole Fund, believes Bitcoin (BTC) follows a pattern similar to gold’s price movement between 2009 and 2011. If the flagship crypto can hold above a key price level, June 2025 could bring a strong recovery. However, he warned that if Bitcoin fails to do so, the anticipated rally may be delayed. Industry Expert Compares Bitcoin to Gold In a recent report, Charles Edwards said that after gold passed its highest price in 2008, it dropped slightly but rose to even higher prices. This happened when the precious metal turned a past resistance level into support. Edward believes Bitcoin is now in a similar position. Bitcoin broke past its 2021 high of $73,884 and reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,980 in late May. However, since then, the digital coin has dropped by 6.39%. Edwards says that for Bitcoin to continue rising, it must turn the $106,047 level into strong support. According to CoinMarketCap data , Bitcoin is trading at $104,379 at the time of writing, down 0.39% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin’s Next Move Hinges on $106K Price Level Bitcoin’s recent drop below the key level of $106,047 has caused some concern among investors. The cryptocurrency closed below this level for two consecutive days, which Charles Edwards describes as a negative sign. He believes that for Bitcoin to recover, it must close above $106,047 and hold that level. The founder said turning a previous resistance level into support is usually a sign that the market is ready to rise. Without this change, Edwards warned that the decline could continue, and any new rally might be delayed. Meanwhile, Katalin Tischhauser from Sygnum noted that Bitcoin is entering a new phase of supply shock . She explained that this supply constraint could create conditions for Bitcoin’s price to rise in the coming months. This development happens simultaneously as big investors are buying more Bitcoin to hold it. This shows that institutions are still interested, even though the market has dropped recently. Bitcoin Set for Short-Term Rebound Amid Fed Uncertainty On the bright side, another crypto analyst, PropheticBTC, agrees with the bullish outlook. He expects the flagship crypto to rise to $110,000 soon. While Edwards focuses more on the medium-term trend, PropheticBTC is more optimistic about the short term. Nevertheless, both analysts believe a recovery is possible, especially if Bitcoin climbs above the $106,047 mark. Beyond technical charts and indicators, macroeconomic and regulatory developments could shake things up. The Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, is scheduled to speak today, and rumors are spreading that President Donald Trump may fire him. Many say any major announcement from the Fed could affect financial markets, including Bitcoin .

2025-06-02T19:10:55,"Crucial: Korean Crypto Investors Say Policy Pledges Influence Their Presidential Vote","BitcoinWorld Crucial: Korean Crypto Investors Say Policy Pledges Influence Their Presidential Vote Are Korean crypto investors letting their digital asset holdings influence their political decisions? A recent survey suggests a significant number are doing just that, indicating that candidates’ stances on crypto policy are playing a notable role in how they cast their presidential vote . Understanding the Pulse of Korean Crypto Investors A comprehensive survey conducted by Bitcoin World and Cratos between May 27 and 30 offered valuable insights into the minds of 2,000 Korean crypto investors . This poll tracked weekly trends and sentiments within this specific demographic, shedding light not only on their market outlook but also on the political weight they place on cryptocurrency-related issues. What’s the Latest on Bitcoin Price Prediction? One key aspect of the survey focused on the immediate future of the market, specifically regarding Bitcoin price prediction . The sentiment showed a notable shift towards optimism: Increase or Significantly Jump: 51.9% of respondents expected Bitcoin’s value to rise this week, a significant jump from 37.6% the previous week. Stable Market: 33.9% predicted a stable market, slightly down from 35.8% last week. Decline or Sharp Drop: Only 14.2% anticipated a decline, a sharp decrease from 26.7% previously. This indicates a growing bullish sentiment among Korean crypto investors looking at short-term movements. Gauging the Overall Market Sentiment Beyond specific price predictions, the survey also captured the broader market sentiment among the respondents. The feelings were mixed, but leaned slightly away from fear: Neutral: 39.2% felt neutral about the overall market conditions. Optimism or Extreme Optimism: 34.7% expressed positive sentiment. Fear or Extreme Fear: 26.1% reported feeling fearful. While a large segment remained neutral, the split between optimism and fear highlights the inherent volatility and uncertainty still felt by investors, even amidst short-term bullishness on Bitcoin. Does Crypto Policy Really Influence the Presidential Vote? This is where the survey delivered its most compelling finding. Ahead of the South Korean presidential election on June 3, respondents were asked about the impact of candidates’ crypto policy pledges on their voting decisions. The results clearly demonstrate that for a significant portion of Korean crypto investors , these policies are not just a minor consideration: Influence Level Percentage of Respondents Affects vote to some extent 34.2% A significant factor 26.5% A minor influence 18.2% Play no role at all 11.1% Single most important factor 10.0% Combining the ‘significant factor’ and ‘single most important factor’ categories reveals that over a quarter (36.5%) of Korean crypto investors consider crypto policy a major determinant in their presidential vote . Including those for whom it has ‘some extent’ of influence brings the total to over 60%. Why is Crypto Policy Becoming a Key Election Issue? The survey results underscore a growing trend: cryptocurrencies and related regulations are transitioning from a niche financial topic to a relevant political issue. As the number of people invested in crypto grows, their collective voice and concerns regarding clear regulation, investor protection, and taxation become more impactful. Candidates who acknowledge and address these concerns through well-defined crypto policy proposals are likely to resonate more strongly with this voter base. Actionable Insights for Candidates and the Industry For political candidates, ignoring the crypto community’s concerns could mean alienating a significant voting bloc. Developing thoughtful and clear positions on crypto regulation, taxation, and innovation is becoming increasingly important. For the crypto industry in Korea, these findings highlight the need for continued engagement with policymakers and public education efforts to shape future regulations constructively. Conclusion: Crypto Investors Make Their Voices Heard The survey provides compelling evidence that Korean crypto investors are not just passive market participants; they are engaged citizens who consider digital asset policies when making their presidential vote . With shifting sentiments on Bitcoin price prediction and varying degrees of market sentiment , the community remains dynamic, but their political influence, tied directly to crypto policy , is becoming undeniable. This signals a future where cryptocurrency issues will likely remain a relevant topic in political discourse.

2025-06-02T19:07:06,"Meta Shareholders Overwhelmingly Reject Proposal to Consider Bitcoin Treasury Strategy","Meta (META) shareholders have overwhelmingly voted against a proposal to add bitcoin BTC to the company’s balance sheet, according to a May 28 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Just 3.92 million votes supported the measure, while nearly 5 billion were cast in opposition. The idea was put forward in January by Ethan Peck, a bitcoin advocate who works as the bitcoin director for the wealth management firm Strive. Peck’s proposal called for Meta to move a portion of its $72 billion in cash and cash equivalents into bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. He argued that the tech giant should treat bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, similar to a corporate war chest designed to weather monetary policy uncertainty. The campaign was not limited to Meta. Peck also targeted Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) with similar proposals, filed on behalf of the conservative think tank National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR). Microsoft shareholders recently voted against the plan. Amazon has not yet held a vote. Though Meta doesn’t hold crypto on its balance sheet, the company has dabbled in blockchain before. In 2019, it announced Libra, a global stablecoin project backed by a basket of fiat currencies. That effort collapsed in 2022 after regulatory backlash and internal struggles, rebranding briefly as Diem before being shut down. Meta’s broader crypto strategy remains unclear. While its metaverse ambitions prompted the 2021 rebrand from Facebook to Meta, the company has pulled back on that vision in recent months. Still, earlier this year, reports surfaced that Meta was exploring the use of stablecoins to manage payments across its family of apps.

2025-06-02T19:00:55,"Ethereum ETF Inflows Explode: US Spot ETH ETFs Attract $285.84M in Powerful Third Week","BitcoinWorld Ethereum ETF Inflows Explode: US Spot ETH ETFs Attract $285.84M in Powerful Third Week Hey crypto enthusiasts! Get ready for some exciting news from the world of institutional investment. The US Spot ETH ETFs are making waves, recently recording a significant surge in capital inflows. This isn’t just a one-off event; it marks the third consecutive week where these investment vehicles have attracted substantial funds, signaling growing interest from investors looking to gain exposure to Ethereum (ETH) through regulated channels. US Spot ETH ETFs: A Closer Look at Recent Inflows According to the latest data compiled by SoSoValue, the collective net inflow into US Spot Ethereum (ETH) Exchange-Traded Funds reached an impressive $285.84 million last week. This figure underscores a sustained positive trend, extending the streak of weekly gains to three. For those tracking the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, this continuous inflow into Ethereum -based products is a key indicator of market sentiment and increasing comfort levels among traditional finance players. What exactly are we talking about here? A US Spot ETH ETF is an investment fund traded on traditional stock exchanges that holds actual Ethereum as its underlying asset. This structure allows investors to invest in ETH without directly buying, holding, or managing the cryptocurrency themselves, navigating the complexities of wallets, private keys, and crypto exchanges. The approval and launch of these ETFs earlier this year were monumental steps for the crypto industry in the United States. Which Ethereum ETF Inflows Led the Pack? While the overall number is strong, the performance varies among the different funds available. Analyzing the individual fund flows gives us a clearer picture of where the capital is heading. Here’s a snapshot of the activity last week: BlackRock’s ETHA: This fund emerged as the undisputed leader, attracting a staggering $205.85 million in inflows. BlackRock’s entry into the crypto ETF space, following its success with Bitcoin ETFs, continues to demonstrate its significant influence and investor confidence. Grayscale’s ETHE: In contrast, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust, which converted into an ETF, experienced the largest outflow, shedding $4.62 million . Outflows from Grayscale’s products (both Bitcoin and Ethereum) have been a common theme since their conversion to ETFs, often attributed to investors moving from the higher-fee trust structure to potentially lower-fee ETF options, or simply taking profits. Other Funds: While BlackRock and Grayscale represent the extremes, other issuers like Fidelity, VanEck, and Ark 21Shares also have active US Spot ETH ETFs. Their combined performance contributed to the remaining net inflow, indicating broader participation beyond just the largest players. This distribution highlights a common pattern seen with the Bitcoin ETFs as well: significant capital gravitating towards offerings from major financial institutions like BlackRock, while older trust structures like Grayscale’s experience some degree of capital rotation. Understanding the Significance of ETH ETF Trends Why should we pay attention to these ETH ETF flow numbers? They offer valuable insights into several aspects of the market: Institutional Appetite: Consistent inflows suggest that large investment firms, hedge funds, and asset managers are increasingly comfortable allocating capital to Ethereum via regulated products. This institutional validation is crucial for the long-term growth and stability of the crypto market (Benefit). Increased Accessibility: ETFs make it easier for retail investors with traditional brokerage accounts to add ETH exposure to their portfolios without navigating the complexities of direct crypto ownership (Benefit). This expands the potential investor base significantly. Market Maturity: The successful launch and operation of these ETFs indicate a maturing market infrastructure capable of supporting crypto-based financial products within traditional frameworks. Potential Price Impact: While not a direct one-to-one correlation, sustained inflows into ETFs can absorb supply from the market, potentially contributing to upward price pressure on Ethereum itself (Benefit). Challenges Remain: Despite the positives, investors should remember that ETH ETFs are still subject to market volatility, regulatory changes, and potential tracking errors. Fees associated with ETFs can also be higher than holding ETH directly (Challenge). What’s Driving Current Crypto ETF Momentum? The positive momentum in US Spot ETH ETFs doesn’t happen in isolation. It’s influenced by several factors contributing to the broader Crypto ETF landscape: Successful Precedent Set by Bitcoin ETFs: The highly successful launch and performance of US Spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier in the year created a template and demonstrated strong market demand for crypto-backed ETFs. This likely paved the way and built confidence for Ethereum counterparts (Example). Ethereum’s Network Developments: Ongoing developments on the Ethereum network, such as the recent Dencun upgrade, improve its efficiency and scalability, potentially making it a more attractive asset for long-term investment. Evolving Regulatory Landscape: While still complex, steps towards clearer regulatory frameworks in some regions can increase investor confidence. Overall Market Sentiment: Broader positive sentiment in the cryptocurrency market often translates to increased interest across major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These factors collectively create an environment where investors, both large and small, are exploring avenues to participate in the crypto space, and ETFs offer a familiar and regulated pathway. Actionable Insights for Investors Watching ETH ETFs So, what can you take away from this news if you’re considering investing or are already involved in the crypto market? Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand the specifics of each ETH ETF, including its fees, structure, and the issuer’s reputation, before investing (Actionable Insight). Consider Your Investment Goals: Are you looking for long-term exposure or short-term trading opportunities? ETFs might suit different strategies than direct ETH ownership (Actionable Insight). Understand the Risks: Remember that investing in an ETH ETF carries the same underlying price risk as holding Ethereum itself. The crypto market is known for its volatility (Actionable Insight). Diversification: Consider how an ETH ETF fits into your overall investment portfolio and risk tolerance (Actionable Insight). The inflows are a positive sign, but they are just one piece of the puzzle when making investment decisions. In conclusion, the sustained inflows into US Spot ETH ETFs, highlighted by BlackRock’s strong performance and a third consecutive week of gains, signal growing institutional and potentially retail interest in gaining regulated exposure to Ethereum. While Grayscale’s outflows represent a different dynamic, the overall trend points towards increasing acceptance and integration of crypto assets into traditional finance. This is a significant development for the Ethereum ecosystem and the broader crypto market, suggesting continued momentum as these investment products become more established.

2025-06-02T18:47:58,"Bitwise CIO Lauds Ripple’s XRP Loyal Base, Says XRP Not Competing with Bitcoin","Cryptocurrency markets often fixate on rivalries. Bitcoin vs. Ethereum . Solana vs. Hyperliquid. But at a Las Vegas conference last month, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan argued that XRP simply isn’t in Bitcoin’s ring. His remarks spurred fresh debate on how digital assets carve out unique niches—and why communities may matter as much as technology. On a Saturday at 1 p.m. Eastern Time, an estimated 1,000 people packed into the XRP Las Vegas venue. Investor conferences rarely attract such numbers during early afternoon weekend slots. But attendees filled every seat. Phones and tablets recorded the scene. Name badges swung across chests. Enthusiasm radiated in the air. Source: Hougan X Hougan delivered his keynote before that crowd. He posted photos afterward, showing rows of attendees glued to presentations. “It’s rare to see this turnout at 1 p.m. on a Saturday,” he said. “That speaks volumes about where XRP stands today.” Divergent Roles: Bitcoin vs. XRP Industry veterans often frame Bitcoin and XRP as adversaries. Yet Hougan challenged this binary. He stressed that each coin serves a distinct market: Bitcoin : Widely referred to as “digital gold,” Bitcoin commands a market capitalization of roughly $2.07 trillion as of late May 2025. Investors value its scarcity and decentralized security. XRP : Built for cross-border settlements, XRP’s daily transaction volume often outpaces many altcoins. As of May 2025, daily XRP transfers exceeded $30 billion. (Source: On-chain data providers). Hougan pointed out that thriving in different realms allows both cryptos to grow without cannibalizing each other. He said, “Bitcoin is reserved for store-of-value. XRP is optimized for fast settlements. One does not eat the other’s lunch.” XRP’s community has remained vocal and active, from developers to retail holders. Hougan praised this network as “the vital pillar of any crypto project.” He highlighted several facts: Developer Activity : Over 200 GitHub repositories related to XRP utilities and integrations remain active. Social Engagement : On platforms like X (Twitter) and Discord, XRP-specific channels host thousands of daily posts promoting real-world use cases—everything from remittance solutions to U.S. digital asset stockpile initiatives. This zeal once proved decisive in Ripple’s legal battle . In 2023, Judge Analisa Torres of the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York referenced affidavits from XRP holders compiled by attorney John Deaton. Those affidavits helped establish that Ripple’s programmatic token sales did not qualify as securities. After that ruling, major U.S. exchanges—including Kraken and Coinbase—re-listed XRP for trading. Both platforms cited renewed regulatory clarity as the driving factor. Ripple’s 2023 courtroom victory marked a turning point. Although Ripple still faces additional compliance hurdles, the decision lifted a cloud hanging over XRP’s trading status. Hougan underlined that community-driven legal support underscored XRP’s resilience. He added, “When holders step up, regulators and judges take note.” Since re-listing, XRP’s 24-hour trading volume has averaged $4 billion, a 35% increase from pre-ruling levels. Price volatility also declined. The token’s 30-day realized volatility dropped from 85% in June 2023 to 60% by March 2025. ETF Outlook Remains Bright In October 2024, Bitwise became the first asset manager to file a U.S. SEC application for an XRP spot ETF, signaling a growing institutional appetite for the asset class. Hougan has remained buoyant on the idea ever since. On live television in early 2025, he noted “strong demand” for an XRP ETF. As of June 2025, the SEC has yet to approve any spot XRP ETF . But industry insiders remain optimistic. Several proposals are in limbo, awaiting the regulator’s next steps. Hougan predicts a launch “later this year,” assuming no new regulatory setbacks. For comparison, the SEC approved the first Bitcoin spot ETF in January 2025, attracting $3.2 billion in assets within two weeks. Given the token’s utility-driven narrative and mobilized community, observers believe an XRP equivalent could draw $1 billion to $2 billion in its first month. With Bitwise’s XRP ETF filing still pending, market watchers will track SEC rulings closely. For now, XRP’s community is a testament to what organized advocacy can achieve. As Hougan put it, “Communities win hearts, minds, and sometimes, court cases.”",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitwise-cio-lauds-ripples-xrp-loyal-base-says-xrp-not-competing-with-bitcoin/,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare

Stablecoins are digital tokens designed to maintain a constant value against a fiat currency such as the US dollar. To date, there are about $243 billion worth of these assets in circulation, and c iting a statement from Stripe co-founder and president John Collison, Bloomberg reports that banks are eager to engage with stablecoins. Says Collison in an interview, “In the conversations we have with them, they’re very interested. This is not something that banks are just kind of brushing away or treating as a fad. Banks are very interested in how they should be integrated with stablecoins into their product offerings as well.” Collision says the talks happened after Stripe rolled out several stablecoin-related products in recent months, including a platform that gives fintechs the ability to quickly start their own stablecoin-card programs for customers. Last month, Stripe also announced that it is developing its stablecoin , which will be powered by the stablecoin infrastructure startup Bridge, a firm acquired by the payments giant last year. Stripe Crypto product manager Jennifer Lee says the company is ready to start testing the asset and invites companies outside the US, EU and the UK to reach out if they are interested in dollar access.

In a new interview with FOX Business, Dimon says that one of the biggest economic problems facing America is its increasing national debt, and that the government needs to tackle it. “[The US debt level is] a big deal. It is a real problem, but one day the bond market’s going to have a tough time. I don’t know if it’s six months or six years. I think we have to focus on it. But when you say focus on it, the real focus should be growth, pro-business, proper deregulation, permitting reform, getting rid of blue tape, getting skills in schools, get that growth going. That’s the best way. And then reform some of these programs everyone knows could be reformed properly. And I think some of the reform could take place. We’re not taking benefits out of poor people or sick people, old people. You’re just putting rules in place that make it more reasonable, less fraud, less waste, less abuse. I think all those things need to be done, and then we can conquer that problem.” Commenting on the weak US bond market, Dimon warns that if the country’s economy weakens due to its debt and other factors, investors may continue to flee US dollar assets, causing more bond market turmoil. The CEO doesn’t give a timeline, but says “it will happen.” “What the public has understand is that something like $30 trillion of securities trades every day. These are investors around the world. Foreigners own $35 trillion of American securities. They have another $30 trillion private investments in the United States, or something like that in the United States. People vote with their feet, and they’re going to be looking at the country, the rule of law, the inflation rates, the central bank policies, what they want to hedge and what they don’t want to hedge. Those [bond] rates aren’t set by central banks. They can affect them. They can twist them. They can do things to make you feel more comfortable, which they should do. But if people decide that the US dollar is not the place to be you could see credit spreads gap out and that would be quite a problem. We had that during COVID. The Fed properly stepped in then… It will happen again. I can almost guarantee that I just know exactly when or what the trigger might be.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The move follows a $1 million investment in Bitcoin ( BTC ) made by NewGen in December 2024. This latest decision marks a significant increase in its digital asset exposure. The company said the $30 million investment will be financed through existing credit lines with ATW and White Lion. Solana ( SOL ), renowned for its high-speed transactions and expanding decentralized app ecosystem, enables token holders to earn staking rewards while supporting the network’s operations. CEO Siu Wing Fung Alfred described the investment as a “natural evolution” of the firm’s digital asset strategy and a way to diversify NewGen’s portfolio.

According to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing , Strategy said on Monday that it had purchased $75 million worth of Bitcoin in cash between May 26 and June 1 at an average price of $106,495 per Bitcoin. Strategy now holds a total of 580,955 BTC — worth over $60 billion — bought at an average price of $70,023 per Bitcoin for a total cost of around $40.7 billion, including fees and expenses, according to the company’s co-founder and executive chairman, Michael Saylor. For context, that’s roughly 2.9% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply — fortifying its standing as the world’s biggest corporate holder of Bitcoin.

2025-06-02T18:29:59,"Elon Musk Announces Launch Of XChat — But Tech Experts Question Its Supposed ‘Bitcoin-Style’ Encryption","Eccentric tech billionaire Elon Musk, the owner of the X (formerly Twitter) social media platform, announced on Sunday the launch of a brand-new messaging feature called XChat. The feature touts capabilities such as encrypted conversations, vanishing messages, file transfers, and audio and video calls. However, Musk’s statement that XChat is built on a programming language called Rust with Bitcoin-style encryption confounded Bitcoiners. The comment sparked a flurry of replies from Bitcoin enthusiasts and cryptography experts, who expressed doubts about what exactly it meant. Experts Are Skeptical Of “Bitcoin-Style” Encryption JAN3 and Pixelmatic CEO Samson Mow noted that “Bitcoin isn’t encrypted,” while Bitcoin core developer Luke Dashjr also chimed in, stating “Bitcoin doesn’t even use encryption” and that using the Rust language was “a bad idea for security reasons.” Bitcoin employs elliptic curve cryptography and SHA-256 hashing for transaction validation and key generation. However, transactions conducted on the Bitcoin blockchain are not encrypted but are signed. Everything you do is broadcast publicly on the blockchain, as all data shared between Bitcoin nodes is unencrypted. “Seriously, what is Bitcoin-style encryption? Bitcoin primarily uses signatures, not encryption,” Ian Miers, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Maryland, said on X . “This is like saying, we decided to run our rocket on water, since NASA uses Hydrogen and Oxygen. Musk’s announcement follows a week of revived interest in his various firms after he confirmed his exit from the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.). DOGE, named in part as a nod to Musk’s favored crypto Dogecoin, was created to reduce federal waste. Bitcoin, the industry’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, traded lower near $104,159 at publication time, having declined by over 5% over the past week, CoinGecko data shows . “Needless to say, “Bitcoin style” and “Rust” are not descriptions of an encryption scheme, nor are they strong indicators of security for a messaging app. Also, unless encrypted DMs are only in app, odds are they aren’t just in Rust,” Miers concluded . It’s worth mentioning that Musk’s EV maker Tesla purchased $1.5 billion worth of BTC in February 2021, calling it a reserve-management strategy. Although the company offloaded the majority of its holdings in Q2 2022, it still holds approximately 11,900 BTC on its balance sheet.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/elon-musk-announces-launch-of-xchat-but-tech-experts-question-its-supposed-bitcoin-style-encryption/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|MINING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Elon Musk",cryptocompare
2025-06-02T18:18:29,"Best crypto to buy as start of altcoin season favours low cap coins","Altcoin season has officially arrived, sparking fresh excitement across the crypto markets as both large and low-cap tokens begin to rally. The momentum has been building gradually, but over the last few days, key indicators have confirmed that the altcoin market is entering a bullish phase. Monero (XMR), Maker (MKR), and Sonic (S) are among the large-cap altcoins that have taken the lead, showing strong price performances and growing investor interest. Low-cap altcoins are the biggest gainers While these top-tier coins are gaining traction, the most dramatic surges are occurring in the low-cap segment, where returns can be significantly higher for early entrants. Build on BNB (BOB), WEMIX, Layer 3 (L3), and Maple Finance (SYRUP) have emerged as some of the biggest gainers as trading volumes and percentage gains skyrocket. BOB has jumped over 266% in just 24 hours, attracting fresh eyes to the BNB ecosystem and proving that even niche tokens can lead the way during altcoin rallies. WEMIX is following closely, climbing nearly 59% as trading activity surged, supported by growing interest in its gaming and NFT infrastructure. Layer 3, known for its Web3 integration tools, also delivered a solid 34.3% gain, while SYRUP added to the trend with a 15.8% rise, signalling that decentralised finance (DeFi) remains a key narrative. Today’s top gainers |Source: Coingecko The rise of these low-cap altcoins often signals the start of a more aggressive alt season, where traders rotate profits from Bitcoin and Ethereum into riskier, high-reward tokens. Which is the best crypto to buy as the altcoin season starts? For new investors entering the market, this moment presents a strategic opportunity to discover emerging coins before they receive mainstream attention. The environment is particularly favourable for upcoming projects like Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP), which is currently finalising its presale and preparing for its first exchange listing. Earlier today, the Bitcoin Pepe team announced that its listing date has been pushed to June 17, giving investors a short but crucial window to accumulate tokens at the presale price. Bitcoin Pepe @BitcoinPepe_ · Follow Presale AnnouncementWe’ve been working closely with exchanges, but as these things go, they need a bit more time to finalise. Therefore, our listing announcement is now set for June 17th, with more info coming 🗓️To thank our early supporters, we’re giving a 30% bonus to 6:00 PM · Jun 2, 2025 48 Reply Copy link Read 14 replies To reward early adopters, the project is now offering a 30% bonus to everyone who has already participated in the presale, further strengthening confidence and demand. Notably, Bitcoin Pepe positions itself as the world’s first meme-based Bitcoin Layer-2 project, aiming to bring Solana-like speed and cost-efficiency to the Bitcoin ecosystem. It introduces a new PEP-20 token standard, allowing memecoins to launch on Bitcoin, a concept that merges the power of BTC with the viral potential of meme culture. This innovative narrative has already attracted massive interest, with the presale raising over $13.6 million out of a $14.08 million target. With the final tokens now selling at $0.0396, and just 15 days left before the CEX and DEX listings go live, momentum is building fast. Bitcoin Pepe’s unique approach to combining Bitcoin’s longevity with the explosiveness of memes has resonated with both retail traders and influencers across the Web3 space. In addition, the team behind BPEP includes crypto veterans like Tafcir, formerly of Ubisoft’s Web3 division, and Allan, a seasoned community builder with deep roots in decentralised culture. As the altcoin season unfolds, Bitcoin Pepe’s timing couldn’t be better, placing it in a position to benefit from renewed interest in novel, early-stage crypto assets. Presale buyers could not only lock in lower prices but also receive bonus allocations, putting them in an advantageous position before potential listing surges. For investors looking to enter the market during altcoin season, BPEP offers both narrative appeal and practical utility, making it more than just another meme token. Moreover, the project’s roadmap includes a Layer-2 bridge, a native DEX, and community staking, providing strong foundations for long-term value. Given the market’s shift toward high-upside, low-cap assets, Bitcoin Pepe stands out as a compelling option ahead of its anticipated public debut.

2025-06-02T18:03:06,"Is the crypto bull run still alive? A Bitcoin price technical analysis deep dive","Bitcoin’s recent pullback has sparked debate: is the bullish trend still intact, or is a deeper correction on the horizon? With price currently trading above a key channel low and the 200-day moving average, this zone may represent the foundation for the next leg higher—toward $116,000. After tapping a new all-time high around $111,900, Bitcoin ( BTC ) entered a corrective phase, pulling back toward high-timeframe support at $104,300. This zone marks the bottom boundary of the bullish channel that has contained price action for months. Rejections from the channel high often lead to retests of the channel low, which is precisely what has occurred. Price is now hovering just above the 200-day moving average, a level closely watched by institutional traders and a historically reliable marker of macro support. Key technical points Channel Low Support at $104,300 : Acts as the structural base for the current bullish trend; holding this level is crucial for any continuation to the upside. 200-Day Moving Average: Bitcoin is currently trading above this dynamic support, reinforcing bullish bias if it continues to hold. Trendline Resistance Above: A descending trendline acts as minor resistance. Breaking this would signify a structural shift and the start of a new bullish leg. Bullish Market Structure Since $74,000: Price continues to print higher highs and higher lows. As long as this pattern holds, the trend remains intact. “Power of Three” Accumulation Structure: Price appears to be forming an accumulation-manipulation-distribution phase. Reclaiming the channel confirms the bullish reversal. Failed Auction Possibility: If price reclaims the channel after manipulation, a failed auction scenario is confirmed, greatly increasing the odds of a move to $116,000. BTCUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView From a market context perspective, the rejection from the channel high and subsequent retracement toward the channel low are technically expected. Price inside a well-defined channel often oscillates between its boundaries before breaking in the dominant direction. The rejection at $111,900 aligned with the channel’s resistance, while the current stalling at $104,300 has already produced a strong bullish candle, signaling that buyers are defending this level. This type of impulsive bounce from support suggests a short-term sentiment shift. Structurally, Bitcoin is trading back within its established bullish channel, implying the previous breakout may have been an early expansion or overextension. The current retest can be seen as a healthy reset before continuation. You might also like: Crypto Fight Night ONCHAIN ignites the ring at Philippine Blockchain Week 2025 Of particular importance is the 200-day moving average now sitting just below the price. Historically, this level has acted as long-term support during major bull trends. A close and consolidation above it typically signals that the broader uptrend remains in place. As long as BTC holds this level, it projects long-term strength. BTCUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView Beyond surface-level technicals, there is growing interest in a possible “Power of Three” pattern. This accumulation framework includes three phases: Accumulation – where price consolidates in a range Manipulation – where price breaks below key support, shaking out weak hands Distribution – a powerful rally following the fakeout In this context, the drop below the channel low may represent manipulation. A reclaim of the channel would confirm a failed auction, a classic deviation followed by strong continuation. If this pattern holds, the move to $116,000 could unfold rapidly, aligning with Fibonacci extensions and the measured move from the channel range. BTCUSDT (6H) Chart, Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s broader structure remains technically bullish. Since forming a major swing low at $74,000, the asset has consistently printed higher highs and higher lows. The current correction fits within that structure and could represent a new higher low. Only a clean break below $104,300 on high volume would challenge this thesis. You might also like: Blockchain firm BTCS Inc. buys 1,000 ETH via Crypto.com Volume remains telling. While it spiked during the drop, it has stayed elevated during the defense of $104,300, evidence that demand is present at support. Sustained buying pressure at this level could set the stage for the next upward rotation. What to expect in the coming price action As long as Bitcoin holds above $104,300 and remains above the 200-day moving average, the bullish market structure is intact. A reclaim of the channel followed by a break of trendline resistance would confirm the next bullish phase. Expect a rotation toward $111,900, followed by a measured extension toward $116,000. If this plays out, Bitcoin would validate the Power of Three structure and confirm that the recent breakdown was a deviation, fueling a failed auction rally toward new highs.

Click here to find out more » By Sholanke Dele Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) began Monday’s European session by staging a mild rebound at $105,500, after last week’s 5.5% drop from $109,000 to $103,200. That retracement pulled the price below the 0.786 Fibonacci level of the rally that ended at the all-time high of $112,000, signalling profit-taking into month-end. Despite the late-May weakness, Bitcoin still closed the month with an 11% gain, building on April’s 14% rise. That two-month strength suggests the broader bullish structure is still valid, but recent developments now place heavy emphasis on reclaiming critical resistance zones to sustain upward momentum. BTC price dynamics (April - May 2025). Source: TradingView The price rebounded from $103,200 over the weekend, reclaiming the 0.786 Fibonacci level. But today’s Asian session selloff found resistance near $105,800, a level that coincides with both the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, commonly known as the golden ratio, and the 100 EMA on the 4-hour chart. This confluence marks the most immediate barrier for bulls. Bitcoin rally depends on clearing $106,000 and invalidating the EMA death cross As the European session opens, Bitcoin attempts another retest of this resistance zone. But the upside remains constrained by the bearish crossover structure on the 4-hour chart, where the 20 EMA crossed below both the 50 and 100 EMA following last week’s slide. Although the 20 EMA has been reclaimed at $105,350, the 50 EMA at $106,000 is the next hurdle before further upside can be considered. Momentum also reflects indecision. The RSI holds around 50, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. This supports the idea of a key inflection point, where the next move will depend on whether price breaks above the golden ratio or slips back toward support. If bulls fail to reclaim the $106,000 to $107,000 resistance band, downside could revisit the previous week’s low at $103,200. A break above $107,000, however, would likely confirm a broader bullish continuation for early June. Bitcoin price dropped to $104,750 and tested the key Fibonacci zone before rebounding . A death cross on the 4-hour chart increased the risk of further decline.

2025-06-02T17:53:57,"Crypto prices today: Bitcoin at risk below $104K, XMR, KAIA lead daily gains","Bitcoin extended its downtrend from May 27, with bulls attempting to hold the line at the critical $104,000 support level, a threshold analysts view as pivotal in averting a deeper market correction. With risk appetite fading, the total crypto market cap dropped by over 2 percent to $3.36 trillion, revisiting early May levels. The sentiment shift was reflected in the Crypto Fear and Greed Index, which dropped to 56, signaling a move from greed to a more cautious, neutral stance. Altcoins traded largely flat, showing limited momentum as Bitcoin dominance continued to weigh on broader market activity. While a few names posted modest gains, the majority hovered near previous levels or recorded slight declines. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin’s latest drop comes amid growing macroeconomic concerns, most notably stalled trade negotiations between the United States and China. The breakdown in talks has reignited global risk aversion, prompting investors to shift away from speculative assets, such as cryptocurrencies. Geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe added to the cautious mood, as renewed concerns over the Russia-Ukraine conflict resurfaced in market discussions. Bitcoin slipped below $104,000 at the June 2 Wall Street open, coinciding with broader market unease around the potential collapse of ongoing peace efforts. Analysts at the Kobeissi Letter noted that markets were effectively pricing out expectations of a resolution, following months of behind-the-scenes diplomacy. While former President Donald Trump had reportedly been working on a peace framework, the lack of formal communication from US officials has fueled speculation and uncertainty over the conflict’s trajectory. This risk-off sentiment was reflected in the derivatives market, where over $156 million in crypto futures positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours. According to Coinglass data, 73,552 traders were wiped out during the sell-off, with long positions accounting for the bulk of the damage at $76.39 million. Bitcoin and Ethereum bore the brunt of the derivatives washout, with ETH alone seeing $3.08 million in long liquidations. The imbalance between long and short liquidations suggests that traders were overly optimistic on a rebound, only to be caught off guard by the sharp downside move. Adding further pressure, institutional flows have also turned negative. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded back-to-back outflows over the past two trading sessions, with a combined drawdown of nearly $975 million. This ended a 10-day streak of inflows, raising concerns over waning institutional conviction at current price levels. With sentiment retreating and both derivatives and spot flows turning bearish, the market appears to be entering a consolidation phase. Will Bitcoin crash? Most analysts are not calling for an outright crash, but rather expect Bitcoin to enter a consolidation phase as it digests recent volatility. Trading firm QCP Capital noted that despite the recent swings, Bitcoin is still holding above 102,000 dollars, pointing to underlying support in that range. According to their latest market bulletin, volatility has compressed and risk reversals are stabilising, which often suggests quieter price action ahead. In the absence of fresh catalysts, QCP expects Bitcoin to trade within a broad range of 100,000 to 110,000 dollars over the near term. Others like Daan Crypto Trades are watching short-term patterns closely. Based on prior monthly trends, the trader believes early June moves may fade once a local reversal forms. If that scenario plays out, it could guide trading direction for the rest of the month, although the broader trend remains unclear.

June has been a bearish month for Bitcoin in four of the past six years, and as such, seasonal weakness could persist if macro pressures stay in focus. Traders are also watching key economic data from the US this week, particularly unemployment figures and any signals from the Federal Reserve. All eyes will be on Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s opening remarks due later today. The strength of the labour market is being reassessed after recent data hinted at softening, raising questions about the Fed’s ability to keep rates elevated. Although inflation appears to be cooling, as seen in the latest PCE print, the Fed has so far held firm. President Trump’s recent meeting with Powell didn’t move market expectations either, with CME FedWatch data showing traders still do not anticipate a rate cut before September. That said, some analysts see a potential tailwind for Bitcoin in the weakening US dollar. The Dollar Index has dropped back below 99, reversing its earlier gains. According to experts at Mosaic Asset Management, if dollar weakness deepens, it could signal broader concerns over the US fiscal outlook, a setup that could benefit assets like gold and Bitcoin over the longer term. At the moment, some Bitcoin technicals point to a deeper correction. The cryptocurrency has broken below the lower boundary of a bear flag pattern at 104,800 dollars on the four-hour chart, confirming a bearish continuation setup. This breakdown opens the door to a potential move toward the pattern’s projected target of 97,690 dollars. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView. Supporting the bearish case, BTC’s Relative Strength Index remains weak, with the RSI hovering around 44. This suggests that selling pressure is still dominant, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to further downside unless a strong reversal catalyst emerges. Nevertheless, not all market watchers are leaning bearish, with some viewing the latest pullback as a necessary reset within a broader uptrend. According to Merlijn The Trader, a golden cross has recently formed on Bitcoin’s daily chart, mirroring a similar setup seen late last year. At the time, a 10 percent correction was followed by a sharp 63 percent rally. If that pattern repeats, Merlijn suggests Bitcoin could be primed for a breakout move exceeding 60 percent in the coming weeks.

Altcoin market Over the past 24 hours, the altcoin market cap fell 1.6% to $1.23 trillion when writing, while the Altcoin Season Index showed a reading of 22, confirming a Bitcoin-dominated market. While Ethereum (ETH), the leading altcoin by market cap, still managed to gain 1.18% over the day, trading at $2,536 with a market cap of nearly $306 billion while other large-cap altcoins like Solana (SOL), Tron (TRX), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Sui (SUI) have experienced slight losses ranging between 0-1%. The leading gainer among the top 99 altcoins was Monero (XMR), which managed to secure double-digit gains of 11.3% as of press time, while Kaia (KAIA) and Sky (SKY) posted gains of 7.5% and 4.3%, respectively. Source: CoinMarketCap Monero’s price surge appears linked to increased demand after hackers reportedly used over $335 million in stolen Bitcoin to acquire and move funds through its network, likely contributing to the sharp appreciation. KAIA saw a brief rally following the announcement of a 2 million dollar grant program, which seemed to have reignited interest among traders and long-term holders. Meanwhile, SKY managed to lock on to profits after its cofounder announced that SKY staking is going live today, with an expected yearly return of 25% based on the current price and staking participation.
