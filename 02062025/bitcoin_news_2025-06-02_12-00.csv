2025-06-02T09:56:28,"Best Crypto to Buy Now As Leverage Traders Get Rekt By Price Volatility","The crypto market just witnessed another violent shakeout—Bitcoin briefly slipped under the $104,000 mark, triggering over $688 million in long liquidations. It was the largest wipeout since February, with nearly 90% of losses stemming from traders betting on the upside. Major futures positions on BTC, ETH, SOL, and DOGE were forcibly closed as cascading liquidations kicked in across exchanges. One headline-grabbing casualty was James Wynn, a whale known for aggressive bets, who reportedly lost nearly all his capital after a $1.25 billion BTC long backfired. As events like this unfold, many investors are starting to view traditional trading as a high-risk arena and are now leaning toward presales—where the entry cost is low and the upside potential remains significant, especially during launches. Volatility Wrecks Traders as Attention Shifts to High-Upside Presales The latest correction has again exposed the vulnerability of leveraged traders. Bitcoin’s sharp retracement below $104,000 erased nearly $700 million in open long positions. This wasn’t a quiet correction—it was a market-wide flush. The effects rippled across Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin, all posting significant single-day losses. Futures trading, which had seen renewed enthusiasm with open interest surging 51% since April, became the center of collapse. Traders who overexposed themselves to bullish derivatives faced rapid forced closures, amplifying the sell-off. Presales offer a middle ground between passive investing and active trading. They retain the upside that excites traders but without the exposure to intraday volatility. I’ll run it back, I always doAnd I’ll enjoy doing itI like playing the gameI like the swingsMoney is all about mindsetAt the end of the day, I’m still richer than 99.9% of CT brokiesI took a large and calculated bet at making billions, most of you wouldn’t dare,… — James Wynn (@JamesWynnReal) May 31, 2025 Among the most dramatic losses was that of James Wynn, whose on-chain trading activity had earned both praise and scrutiny. Starting with just $4,000, he built up an astonishing $100+ million portfolio through daring long positions on BTC and various tokens. But during the tariff-induced drop, Wynn entered an enormous $1.25 billion long on Bitcoin. As the price slid below $105,000, the position unraveled catastrophically. Fees and slippage contributed to a $37 million loss in a single trade. In the following days, Wynn attempted to recover using high-risk memecoin positions across PEPE, TRUMP, SUI, and others. These too were liquidated as volatility persisted. What remained in his account: $23. Wynn’s story has become more than just drama—it’s now a case study. In forums, his name trends not with admiration, but as a warning. This has led to a change in mindset. While traditional trading allows fast gains, it also demands constant risk tolerance. Investors who were drawn to trading for potential returns are now gravitating toward presales—projects that launch with micro market caps and the possibility of a 10x to 100x increase. These tokens often begin at fractions of a cent, and unlike active trading, they require no timing precision or leverage to deliver gains. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Presales That Could 10x or More SUBBD As traditional trading continues to burn high-leverage players, a shift is happening toward presales that combine utility with long-term viability. SUBBD is drawing attention for precisely that reason. Instead of relying on speculative hype, it introduces a model that reshapes how content creators monetize their work. At its foundation is a decentralized protocol that lets creators issue their own branded tokens directly to supporters, bypassing outdated subscription models and eliminating platform fees that typically drain creator income. The $SUBBD token serves both creators and their communities. For users, it’s a gateway to exclusive content, early drops, private communities, and even voting rights on creator-driven proposals. For creators, it’s a means to lock in recurring income without surrendering control to centralized platforms. It removes the instability associated with ad-driven monetization and reimagines patronage as an investment-based ecosystem. What makes SUBBD relevant right now is its contrast with speculative derivatives. Instead of chasing volatility, it supports a system where holders are incentivized through staking, creator growth, and demand-driven appreciation. Projects like this are gaining traction because they align with the current investor mood—less exposure to sudden crashes, more focus on potential that compounds over time. With presale access offering early exposure to a fixed token supply and an ecosystem that thrives on creator output, SUBBD appeals to those who still seek aggressive upside but prefer not to live on the edge of liquidation. It answers volatility not with avoidance, but with real infrastructure for sustainable token growth. Snorter When traders like James Wynn lose millions overnight, it brings renewed attention to tools that simplify entry into crypto while avoiding such destructive risk. Snorter is a presale project building precisely in that direction—an automated trading assistant designed for on-chain users who want access to market opportunities without drowning in technical complexity or leverage. Snorter functions as a Telegram-integrated bot that scans for newly launched tokens, verifies contract safety, and even provides gas-efficient sniping features—all within a few taps. Built to streamline Solana-based token trading, it gives retail users the type of agility typically reserved for more seasoned, manually active traders. The value here is access, not leverage. But it’s not just a shortcut to memecoin speculation. Snorter has laid out a plan for tiered access models, a staking-backed subscription utility, and a revenue-sharing structure for early holders of its $SNORT token. Every time a trade is routed through Snorter, protocol fees are distributed to token holders, creating a system that rewards usage rather than speculation. In the wake of cascading market liquidations, tools like this gain weight. They don’t ask users to predict tops or bottoms. Instead, they offer infrastructure to improve trade execution, mitigate risks, and find alpha without depending on futures markets. As volatility shakes the confidence of many, Snorter’s presale represents a calculated pivot toward smarter trading—not riskier one. It’s utility-first, trader-friendly, and designed to reward participation without forcing exposure to the kind of positions that erased fortunes this week. Solaxy With risk tolerance shaken and derivatives growing more unpredictable, investor attention is turning to projects grounded in infrastructure and purpose. Solaxy is one of the few current presales combining both, offering an energy-efficient Layer 2 designed for cross-chain functionality between Ethereum and Solana. At a time when whales are taking profits and traders are sidelined, Solaxy offers a way to align with foundational tech rather than market timing. What sets Solaxy apart is its lightweight validation system. Rather than duplicating heavy chain activity, Solaxy enables smart contract execution with minimal fees and high throughput. This opens up room for DeFi tools, gaming, and staking to function with real-time efficiency and reduced cost. The native token, SOLX, carries the protocol's utility—used for staking, transaction fees, and node incentivization. It’s also how users participate in governance, with plans for decentralized upgrades and cross-chain bridges decided directly through token votes. During the recent market downturn, networks with high gas fees and slower transaction speeds became a source of frustration for developers and users alike. Solaxy’s presale stands out as a response to that tension. Rather than launching into the chaos of an exchange listing, it begins with early incentives, liquidity support, and time to build a network effect without being disrupted by volatility—a thought shared by ClayBro , a popular creator who covered the project on his YouTube channel. Presales like Solaxy are finding traction not because they promise hype, but because they address structural gaps left unfilled by overleveraged projects. For those pivoting from reactive trading toward long-term protocol exposure, Solaxy offers a calm and calculated entry. Best Wallet Token As liquidations unsettle even the most experienced traders, a growing number are shifting their attention toward ecosystems that offer stability, autonomy, and passive growth—all of which define Best Wallet’s vision. Best Wallet Token’s main product is a non-custodial, multi-chain crypto wallet, but it’s far more than just a place to store tokens. It’s a financial toolset, equipped for staking, presale access, portfolio tracking, and on-chain trading—all wrapped into one mobile-first platform. The native token, BEST, acts as a value driver across this ecosystem. It unlocks staking rewards, early access to exclusive token launches via the wallet’s built-in presale aggregator, and future governance participation as the platform moves toward full decentralization. Holders also benefit from performance-based airdrops and trading incentives built directly into the wallet UI, giving BEST utility far beyond mere speculation. In a market where traders are being wiped out chasing fast returns, Best Wallet offers an alternative flow of rewards—one tied to usage, staking, and steady growth. It’s no surprise that attention is turning to it now. It operates quietly in the background, while traders reeling from lost leverage begin valuing reliability. What makes its presale timely is the current user sentiment: less tolerance for noise, more interest in products with real demand. The wallet already supports 60+ chains, shows cross-chain compatibility, and is built with institutional-grade encryption. This is not a bet on market sentiment—it’s a platform that continues to gain traction no matter which way the charts move. BTC Bull For traders who built fortunes overnight and lost them just as fast, BTC Bull is starting to look like a much-needed change of pace. It doesn’t rely on rapid scalping or high-risk plays. Instead, it rewards conviction—offering token airdrops tied to Bitcoin milestones and incentivizing users for simply staying engaged as BTC continues its long-term climb. The project is rooted in a philosophy that reflects the original ethos of Bitcoin: community-driven value backed by transparent incentives. With every major price threshold BTC crosses—$110k, $120k, and beyond—holders of BTC Bull’s native token receive milestone-based rewards, while a portion of tokens are burned, ensuring a deflationary supply curve. This system appeals to those who understand timing the market often fails, but being present during key moments matters more. Bitcoin hit $111K. 🐂🔥The first BTCBULL burn milestone is getting closer. pic.twitter.com/1iHi376vQl — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) May 22, 2025 It’s not just about passive rewards, though. BTC Bull also incorporates a structured staking model with tiered APY based on holding behavior. The longer tokens are staked, the greater the returns, creating a rhythm of engagement rather than speculative chaos. While James Wynn’s story is a cautionary tale of what happens when risk goes unchecked, BTC Bull presents a counterbalance: consistent growth built around the strongest asset in crypto. Its presale offers access before token burns and airdrop triggers come into play. For investors looking to stay exposed to Bitcoin’s rise without dancing around leverage, BTC Bull opens up that path—with clarity, structure, and none of the turbulence that took down traders last week. Conclusion For those rethinking their strategy after a tricky week in the markets, presales offer a path that doesn’t demand constant chart-watching or exposure to high-stakes trades. With lower initial valuations and clear utility baked in from the start, these early-stage opportunities present a chance to enter projects before the rest of the market catches on. In times like these, when volatility leaves little room for error, finding entry points that prioritize long-term potential over short-term risk may be the smartest move forward.

2025-06-02T09:52:08,"Analysts caution market volatility as fresh rumors of Fed Chair Jerome Powell exit spread","Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has come under renewed public pressure from President Donald Trump. Rumors started making the rounds on X on June 1, 2025, that Powell was stepping down and the interest rates would soon be cut. However, there has been no official confirmation, and many market analysts are waving off the claims as unfounded. This rumor, cast widely on social platform X on June 1, 2025, stated that Powell was stepping down and the interest rates would soon be cut. However, there has been no official confirmation, and many market analysts are waving off the claims as unfounded. Powel to resign tomorrow 🚨 I see lots of these nonsense posts on CT today Let me tell you 1st – it’s not gonna happen 2nd – if that happened, the markets would dump significantly ⚡️ Why? Trust in dollar and US economy would decrease instantly Just remember what happened… pic.twitter.com/1U2wEVNFE5 — Lana Queen (@Lana_Queen7) June 1, 2025 Polymarket traders seemed equally unimpressed. Despite the rumor, the odds on the prediction market for the question ‘Will Trump remove Jerome Powell in 2025?’ stayed steady at 14%, indicating no increase in confidence in the rumor. Analysts said this skepticism stemmed from a lack of institutional support and a constitutional limit to dismissing the Fed chair. Trump met with Powell on Thursday at the White House, their first sit down since the president’s return to office. The Fed statement said Powell did not appear to shift the policy direction and reiterated that monetary decisions would remain strictly data-dependent. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that meeting, saying that Trump pressed Powell to cut interest rates, citing his country’s economic disadvantage compared to countries like China. Trump has made no secret that he is frustrated with the Fed chair. In April, he tweeted on Truth Social that Powell’s “termination cannot come fast enough.” He later walked that back, saying he “had no intention” of firing him. The Supreme Court has weighed in as well, making it quite clear that Trump does not have the power to dismiss the Fed chair before his term ends in 2026. Fed independence tested as pressure builds Trump has softened the tone in recent days, telling an interviewer that he’s not planning to fire Powell but that he needs to be replaced soon. Trump noted, however, that Powell’s term ends only in a very short period in 2026. However, uncertainty has reignited fears that the Fed is not truly independent. The latest threats from Trump have come after periods of volatility. In one high-profile case, his social media comments sparked more than a few days of market mayhem in April. Interest rates have remained at 4.25% to 4.50% at the central bank’s three latest meetings. Powell has repeatedly refused to bow to political influence and insisted decisions must follow macroeconomic data, not presidential preferences. Powell said in his public remarks that he has not asked for a meeting with any US president and that the central bank must remain independent. A recent Supreme Court ruling allowing Trump to keep some of his dismissed independent agency employees off the job also had some indirect implications, some legal analysts noted. However, the court noted that the deal does not extend to the Federal Reserve, which the court called a uniquely structured body that behaved independently in the past. Bitcoin holds strong amid political uncertainty Bitcoin decoupled from traditional market movements as political tensions rise. Bitcoin traded above $105,000 despite Wall Street’s decline and the U.S. dollar falling to a three-year low. CryptoQuant data suggests that the current rally is getting close to a possible short-term top. The trend remains bullish, but further political uncertainty, which could see volatility spike, may prompt profit-taking. Trump appointed Powell in 2018, and his current term is until May 2026. While he has kept silent on Trump’s personal attacks, he has repeatedly stuck to the Fed’s familiar message of steady prices and maximum employment. He’s also said he did not ask to see any sitting president when he was in office. Powell met the president twice during Trump’s first term—once on his birthday and again later that year. The latest meeting was the first in-person face-to-face exchange during Trump’s second term, which followed months of public pressure. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-06-02T09:50:26,"XChat Security Fortress: Elon Musk Unveils End-to-End Encryption and Bitcoin-Style Features on X","BitcoinWorld XChat Security Fortress: Elon Musk Unveils End-to-End Encryption and Bitcoin-Style Features on X In a significant move for the social media landscape, Elon Musk X has announced the rollout of X’s new messaging feature, dubbed XChat. This isn’t just another chat function; according to Musk, it’s launching with robust security measures designed to protect user conversations, including end-to-end security and what he described as “Bitcoin-style encryption.” For anyone concerned about Messaging App Privacy in the digital age, this announcement from the X platform leadership is certainly attention-grabbing. What is XChat and Why is End-to-End Encryption Crucial? XChat represents X’s effort to build a comprehensive messaging system directly into the social media platform. While X (formerly Twitter) has had direct messages (DMs) for years, this new feature appears to be a significant upgrade, aiming to compete with dedicated messaging apps. At the heart of modern secure messaging is End-to-End Encryption (E2EE). This is a method of secure communication that prevents third parties from reading data while it’s being transferred from one point to another. In essence, only the sender and the intended recipient can read the message. Even the service provider facilitating the communication cannot access the content. Think of it like sending a message in a locked box that only you and your friend have the key to. The postal service (the messaging platform) can carry the box, but they can’t open it to read the message inside. This is fundamentally different from traditional communication methods where the service provider (like an email provider) often has access to the content. Why is E2EE crucial for Messaging App Privacy ? Protects Against Snooping: It makes it incredibly difficult for hackers, governments, or even the platform itself to intercept and read private conversations. Enhances Trust: Users can communicate sensitive information with greater confidence, knowing their messages are for their eyes only. Prevents Data Breaches: If the platform’s servers are compromised, the encrypted message content remains unreadable to the attackers. The inclusion of E2EE in XChat is a fundamental step towards positioning it as a secure communication tool, addressing a critical user need in today’s digital environment. Decoding the “ Bitcoin-Style Encryption ” Claim Perhaps the most intriguing part of Musk’s announcement was the mention of “ Bitcoin-Style Encryption .” It’s important to clarify what this likely means in the context of a messaging app, as it doesn’t imply XChat messages are being stored on the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin uses several cryptographic principles, primarily public-key cryptography (also known as asymmetric encryption) for securing transactions and verifying ownership. It also relies on cryptographic hashing and digital signatures. When Musk refers to “Bitcoin-style encryption” for XChat Security , he is likely referencing the application of similar robust cryptographic principles, specifically public-key cryptography, within the messaging protocol. Here’s how this might manifest: Public-Key Cryptography: Like Bitcoin uses public and private keys for sending/receiving funds securely, XChat likely uses key pairs for users. Your public key can be shared with others so they can encrypt messages only you (with your private key) can decrypt. This is standard for E2EE protocols (like Signal’s protocol, which WhatsApp and others use). Identity Verification: Similar to how Bitcoin transactions are cryptographically signed to prove they come from the owner of the private key, XChat might use digital signatures to verify the authenticity of messages and the identities of participants in a conversation. Secure Key Exchange: A critical part of E2EE is securely exchanging the keys used to encrypt and decrypt messages. Protocols often use methods inspired by cryptographic principles to ensure this exchange is secure and not vulnerable to interception. It’s less likely to mean features directly tied to the blockchain’s immutability or distributed ledger aspects, as XChat is a centralized service run by X. The term is more likely intended to evoke a sense of robust, cryptographically sound security akin to the foundational principles that make Bitcoin transactions secure, rather than integrating with the Bitcoin network itself. Beyond Encryption: Features Enhancing XChat Security and Usability Beyond the core E2EE and “Bitcoin-style” claims, Elon Musk X highlighted several other features rolling out with XChat that contribute to its functionality and potential Messaging App Privacy : End-to-End Security: While often used interchangeably with E2EE, this might imply a broader security posture encompassing not just message content but also protection against metadata leaks or other vulnerabilities within the app itself. Vanishing Messages: This popular feature allows users to set messages to automatically delete after a specified time period. This adds an extra layer of privacy, ensuring sensitive information doesn’t persist indefinitely in chat logs. It’s a common feature in secure messaging apps and enhances user control over their digital footprint. Audio and Video Calling: Integrating secure voice and video communication within the encrypted framework is crucial for a modern messaging app. Ensuring these calls are also end-to-end encrypted provides a private channel for real-time conversations. Support for All File Types: Allowing users to share any type of file (documents, photos, videos, etc.) securely within the encrypted chat environment adds significant utility. This means sensitive documents can potentially be shared without leaving the secure, encrypted channel. These features, combined with the core encryption, aim to make XChat a versatile and secure communication tool for users on the X platform. Under the Hood: Rust and a New Architecture The announcement also mentioned that the system is built using Rust and introduces a completely new architecture. For those interested in the technical underpinnings, this is noteworthy: Rust: Rust is a programming language known for its focus on memory safety and performance. Building a critical security feature like an encrypted messaging system in Rust can help mitigate common vulnerabilities (like buffer overflows) that plague languages without strong memory safety guarantees. This choice suggests a focus on building a stable and secure foundation for XChat. Completely New Architecture: This implies XChat isn’t just an overlay on the old DM system but a fundamental redesign. A new architecture can be optimized for scalability, speed, and crucially, security from the ground up. This allows developers to implement modern encryption protocols and security best practices more effectively than trying to retrofit them into an older system. These technical decisions highlight an apparent commitment to building a robust and secure messaging platform, which is essential for gaining user trust in the realm of Messaging App Privacy . Benefits and Challenges for XChat Security The proposed features offer clear benefits: Enhanced User Privacy: E2EE and vanishing messages significantly improve privacy. Increased Security: Robust encryption protects against interception. Versatile Communication: File sharing, audio/video calls add functionality within a secure channel. Potential for Trust: If implemented correctly, these features could build trust with users concerned about their data. However, challenges exist: Implementation Accuracy: E2EE is complex; flaws in implementation can render it ineffective. The details of the “Bitcoin-style” aspects need clear technical explanation. Trust Deficit: Given past controversies surrounding X and its data policies, building user trust in a new, centralized messaging service with strong privacy claims might be an uphill battle for Elon Musk X . Regulatory Pressure: Strong E2EE often faces pressure from governments seeking access to communications for law enforcement or national security purposes. User Adoption: Competing with established secure messaging apps requires not just features but a proven track record and network effect. Comparing XChat’s Vision to Existing Secure Messaging Apps How does XChat’s announced feature set stack up against leaders in secure messaging? Feature XChat (Announced) Signal Telegram WhatsApp End-to-End Encryption Yes (Rolling Out) Yes (Default for all messages) Yes (For Secret Chats only) Yes (Default for all messages) “Bitcoin-Style” Encryption Claimed (Likely refers to crypto principles) Uses advanced cryptographic protocols Uses advanced cryptographic protocols Uses Signal Protocol Vanishing Messages Yes Yes Yes Yes Audio/Video Calls (E2EE) Yes Yes Yes (Group calls E2EE status varies) Yes Support for All File Types Yes Yes Yes Yes (with size limits) Underlying Tech Mentioned Rust, New Architecture Open Source, Signal Protocol Custom Protocol (MTProto) Signal Protocol Based on the announcement, XChat aims to offer a feature set comparable to other secure messaging apps, particularly regarding E2EE and related privacy features. The key differentiator and point of scrutiny will be the technical implementation and the specifics behind the “Bitcoin-style” claim. What Actionable Insights Can Users Take? For users of X and those interested in secure communication: Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from X regarding the technical details of XChat’s encryption implementation. Look for whitepapers or technical documentation. Verify Claims: Skepticism is healthy in security. Wait for independent security audits or expert analysis of the XChat protocol once it’s fully rolled out. Understand E2EE: Educate yourself on how E2EE works and its limitations. Remember that E2EE protects message content, but metadata (who you talked to, when) might still be accessible to the platform. Consider Alternatives: If Messaging App Privacy is paramount, compare XChat’s features and trust model with established, audited E2EE apps like Signal. Be Mindful of Centralization: XChat is a centralized service. While E2EE protects message content, the platform operator still controls the service, user accounts, and potentially metadata. Conclusion: A Bold Step for XChat Security ? Elon Musk X ‘s announcement of XChat with End-to-End Encryption and “ Bitcoin-Style Encryption ” is a bold statement about X’s ambitions in the secure messaging space. By promising robust privacy features, support for all file types, vanishing messages, and secure calls, XChat aims to be a compelling option for users seeking more private communication within the X ecosystem. The technical choices, like building with Rust and a new architecture, suggest a serious effort to create a secure and performant system. However, the success and trustworthiness of XChat will ultimately depend on the transparency of its implementation, the verifiability of its security claims (especially the “Bitcoin-style” aspect), and X’s overall commitment to user privacy in practice. For users prioritizing Messaging App Privacy , XChat enters a competitive landscape, and its ability to build and maintain trust will be its greatest challenge.

2025-06-02T09:45:19,"IG Group to Let UK Retail Investors Trade BTC, ETH, XRP Directly","Key Takeaways: IG Group will let UK retail investors trade BTC, ETH, XRP, and 35 other tokens. The launch comes as UK crypto ownership grows and new regulations take shape. From 2026, UK crypto firms must report detailed customer data on all trades. UK-listed trading firm IG Group will become the first company on the London Stock Exchange to allow retail investors to buy and sell individual cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP), as part of a new digital assets service. “This is a major milestone in the UK’s crypto journey,” Michael Healy, managing director of IG’s UK business, told The Times . “Customer demand is reaching a tipping point.” Under the new offering, IG retail clients will be able to trade 38 cryptocurrencies through a partnership with Uphold, a digital assets platform. IG Group to Offer BTC, ETH, XRP, and Memecoins The selection will include popular tokens such as BTC, ETH, and XRP, as well as smaller assets like memecoin Dogwifhat. Custody of the assets will be provided by Uphold. However, holdings will not be protected under the UK’s Financial Services Compensation Scheme. The expansion moves IG beyond its traditional core of leveraged trading and stockbroking. It also positions the FTSE 250 firm as a more trusted alternative to existing UK-based crypto services, such as Revolut, which is not listed. Being a listed company helps to “bolster client trust,” Healy said. Interest in crypto among UK consumers is rising. Last year, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) estimated that 12% of UK adults now own cryptocurrency — up from just 4.4% in 2021. The move comes as the UK government finalizes new crypto regulations, aimed at providing long-awaited clarity and addressing risks in the market. However, regulators remain cautious. The FCA has repeatedly warned retail investors that cryptocurrencies lack inherent value and carry high volatility risks. In 2022, the collapse of FTX and the conviction of its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, further rattled the sector. Despite these concerns, institutional interest in crypto is growing. Hedge funds and other professional investors have moved into the space in recent years, while political winds may also be shifting. In the US, President Trump has positioned himself as a crypto supporter, raising hopes for a friendlier regulatory stance. UK to Enforce Mandatory Crypto Trade Reporting The UK will require crypto firms to collect and report detailed customer information on every trade and transfer starting January 1, 2026, as part of a sweeping effort to strengthen tax compliance and oversight in the digital asset sector. According to a recent statement from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the new rules will mandate that platforms record full names, home addresses, and tax identification numbers for all users. Each transaction must also be logged with specifics such as the cryptocurrency used and the amount transferred. The reporting obligation extends beyond individual users to include companies, trusts, and charities engaged in crypto activity. Firms that fail to comply or submit inaccurate data may face penalties of up to £300 ($398) per user.

2025-06-02T09:40:22,"Stablecoins US Dollar: Scaramucci Reveals Surprising Way Crypto Strengthens Reserve Currency Role","BitcoinWorld Stablecoins US Dollar: Scaramucci Reveals Surprising Way Crypto Strengthens Reserve Currency Role Could a digital asset, often viewed with skepticism by traditional finance, actually be a secret weapon for the world’s leading currency? That’s the fascinating perspective recently shared by SkyBridge Capital founder, Anthony Scaramucci. He argues that Stablecoins US Dollar pegged assets are not a threat, but rather a reinforcement of the greenback’s global dominance. This viewpoint challenges the common narrative and opens up an important conversation about the evolving relationship between traditional finance and the crypto world. Stablecoins US Dollar: A Digital Extension? Anthony Scaramucci took to social media platform X to address a pertinent question: Does the U.S. President have a duty to protect the dollar’s value, and do cryptocurrencies, including the often-volatile memecoins, pose a risk to this value? His response was clear and insightful, suggesting that stablecoins, specifically those pegged to the U.S. dollar, actually serve to bolster the dollar’s strength and its critical role as the global reserve currency. But how exactly do these digital tokens achieve this? At their core, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically by being pegged 1:1 with a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. This stability is crucial because it bridges the gap between the volatile crypto market and the traditional financial system. When someone holds a USD-pegged stablecoin like USDT or USDC, they are essentially holding a digital representation of a U.S. dollar claim. This increases the overall demand and utility for the U.S. dollar in the digital economy. How Stablecoins Bolster the Dollar: Increased Accessibility: Stablecoins make the U.S. dollar easily transferable and accessible globally, 24/7, without relying on traditional banking hours or infrastructure. Global Trading Pairs: A vast majority of cryptocurrency trading pairs involve a USD-pegged stablecoin. This means that to participate in the crypto market, traders often need to acquire and hold these dollar-denominated digital assets. Remittance and Payments: Stablecoins offer a faster and cheaper way to send value across borders compared to traditional methods, often denominated in USD, further promoting its use internationally. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): The burgeoning DeFi ecosystem heavily relies on stablecoins for lending, borrowing, and trading. This creates significant demand for USD-pegged assets within this innovative financial space. US Dollar Reserve Currency: Why Stablecoins Matter The US Dollar Reserve Currency status is a cornerstone of American economic power. It means that governments and institutions worldwide hold dollars as a primary reserve asset and use it for international trade and finance. This status provides significant advantages to the U.S., including lower borrowing costs and greater influence in global financial affairs. For decades, this reserve status has been maintained through traditional banking channels, government bonds, and international agreements. However, as the global economy becomes increasingly digitized, the mechanisms by which currencies maintain relevance are also evolving. Stablecoins, by extending the reach and usability of the U.S. dollar into the digital realm, can be seen as a modern tool for reinforcing this status. Stablecoins vs. Other Digital Currencies: It’s important to distinguish USD-pegged stablecoins from other digital currencies like Bitcoin or central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Feature USD-Pegged Stablecoin Bitcoin (BTC) Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) Value Stability Pegged to USD (aims for stability) Highly Volatile Pegged to Fiat Currency (aims for stability) Issuance Private companies/entities Decentralized mining Central Bank Purpose Bridge crypto/fiat, payments, trading, DeFi Store of value, speculative asset, peer-to-peer cash Digital form of fiat currency, potentially for payments, reserves Impact on USD Increases digital demand/utility Alternative asset (potential competition) Direct digital form of USD (if US issues one) While Bitcoin offers an alternative store of value outside the traditional system, and CBDCs represent a potential government-issued digital dollar, stablecoins offer a way for the *existing* U.S. dollar to thrive in the digital economy, driven by private innovation and market demand. Anthony Scaramucci: A Voice from Traditional Finance Why does Anthony Scaramucci ‘s opinion carry weight in this discussion? As the founder of SkyBridge Capital, a global investment firm, Scaramucci is a figure deeply rooted in traditional finance who has also embraced the potential of digital assets. SkyBridge has invested significantly in the crypto space, including Bitcoin funds. His perspective, therefore, comes from someone who understands both the mechanics of global finance and the disruptive potential of cryptocurrencies. His view that stablecoins are beneficial for the dollar contrasts with some policymakers who see *all* forms of crypto as potentially undermining sovereign currencies. Scaramucci’s argument is nuanced: while speculative assets like memecoins might be volatile and pose different questions, stablecoins, by their very design and utility, can act as digital ambassadors for the U.S. dollar on the global stage. Crypto and USD: Is it Conflict or Coexistence? The relationship between Crypto and USD is complex and often debated. Critics argue that the rise of decentralized cryptocurrencies could lead people to abandon fiat currencies, including the dollar. They point to concerns about illicit finance, tax evasion, and the potential for capital flight. However, Scaramucci’s point, focused specifically on stablecoins, highlights a different dynamic. Instead of competing directly as a store of value or medium of exchange in the same way Bitcoin might, USD-pegged stablecoins act more like digital infrastructure built *on top of* the dollar. They facilitate transactions and activities that might not otherwise happen as easily or efficiently using traditional dollar rails, thereby increasing the dollar’s footprint in the digital world. Even memecoins, while speculative and often lacking fundamental value, are typically traded against stablecoins (like USDT or USDC). This indirect link means that even participation in the most speculative corners of the crypto market often involves the use of a dollar-denominated digital asset, further embedding the dollar within the crypto ecosystem. Exploring Stablecoin Benefits Beyond the USD Link While their peg to the U.S. dollar is their defining characteristic in this context, it’s worth exploring other Stablecoin Benefits that contribute to their growing adoption and, consequently, their role in promoting the dollar digitally: Speed and Cost: Transactions using stablecoins on blockchain networks are typically much faster and cheaper than international wire transfers. Programmability: Stablecoins can be used in smart contracts, enabling automated financial operations like escrow, payroll, or complex derivatives in DeFi. Financial Inclusion: For individuals and businesses in regions with unstable local currencies or limited access to traditional banking, USD-pegged stablecoins offer a relatively stable digital store of value and medium of exchange. Transparency: Transactions are recorded on public blockchains, offering a degree of transparency (though privacy varies) not always present in traditional systems. These advantages make USD-pegged stablecoins attractive for a wide range of uses, from trading and yield farming to cross-border payments and online commerce, all of which increase the digital utility of the U.S. dollar. The National Debt Context Scaramucci also touched upon the national debt, noting that while addressing it is possible, it’s unlikely with the current political climate in Washington, D.C. While seemingly separate, this point adds context to the broader economic discussion. A strong U.S. dollar, potentially bolstered by its digital presence via stablecoins, can help manage the burden of national debt by maintaining confidence in U.S. assets and potentially attracting foreign investment. However, Scaramucci’s skepticism highlights the significant fiscal challenges the U.S. faces, which stablecoins alone cannot solve. Challenges and the Path Forward Despite the potential benefits, the stablecoin landscape is not without challenges. Regulatory uncertainty remains a major hurdle. Policymakers are grappling with how to regulate stablecoin issuers to ensure reserves are adequately backed and consumer protection is in place. The collapse of algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) in 2022 served as a stark reminder of the risks associated with poorly designed or unbacked stablecoins. Ensuring the stability and integrity of USD-pegged stablecoins is paramount for them to truly act as reliable digital extensions of the dollar. This requires clear regulation, robust auditing of reserves, and technological resilience. Conclusion: A Surprising Alliance? Anthony Scaramucci’s remarks offer a compelling perspective: far from undermining the U.S. dollar, stablecoins, particularly those pegged to the greenback, can act as powerful digital tools that extend its reach, utility, and ultimately, reinforce its status as the dominant global reserve currency. By providing a stable, accessible, and efficient digital form of the dollar, stablecoins integrate the traditional financial powerhouse with the innovative world of blockchain and cryptocurrency. While challenges, especially regulatory ones, need to be addressed, the potential for a symbiotic relationship between stablecoins and the U.S. dollar reserve currency role is significant. Scaramucci’s view encourages us to look beyond the surface volatility of the crypto market and recognize how certain innovations within it might actually serve to strengthen the foundations of the traditional financial system.

2025-06-02T09:40:08,"Meta Shareholders Shut Down Push for Bitcoin Treasury","The initiative was led by Bitcoin advocate Ethan Peck, who argued for using a portion of Meta’s $72 billion cash reserves to hedge against inflation. However, it is believed that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's controlling stake ensured the proposal’s defeat. Despite this, interest in corporate Bitcoin holdings is still rising globally. Meanwhile, Meta is still laser focused on artificial intelligence and defense applications. The company recently partnered with defense firm Anduril to develop AI-driven AR gear for US soldiers, repurposing metaverse technologies for military use. On the other hand, Meta’s AI research also faces internal struggles, with key talent departing and its Llama models trailing competitors. AI chief Yann LeCun is calling for a paradigm shift when it comes to training methods to build more intelligent systems. Bitcoin Proposal Crushed in Meta Vote Meta shareholders decisively voted against a proposal to explore adding Bitcoin to the tech giant’s balance sheet. The “Bitcoin treasury assessment” proposal was submitted earlier this year by Bitcoin advocate Ethan Peck, but it received just 3.92 million votes in favor. This accounts for about 0.08% of the total votes. Nearly 5 billion shareholders rejected the measure, according to a May 28 regulatory filing . It is assumed that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who controls 61% of the company's voting power, voted against the proposal, which effectively sealed its defeat. (Source: SEC ) Peck’s proposal argued that a portion of Meta’s $72 billion in cash and cash equivalents should be converted into Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. In his supporting statement, Peck claimed that 28% of Meta’s total assets are “consistently diminishing shareholder value” due to currency debasement and bond yields that fail to outpace inflation. He also pointed to BlackRock’s stance that a 2% allocation into Bitcoin is considered reasonable. Peck is the Bitcoin director at Strive, and submitted the proposal on behalf of his family’s Meta shares. He previously made similar pitches to Microsoft and Amazon. Microsoft shareholders ultimately rejected the idea in December, while Amazon investors are still due to vote on a similar proposal. Despite these high-profile rejections, corporate interest in Bitcoin is still gaining momentum. According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET , 116 publicly traded companies now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Some of the more recent entrants include GameStop and Swedish health tech firm H100, both of which made their first Bitcoin purchases last month. Holders of Bitcoin (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.net ) Strategy is still the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 580,250 BTC worth approximately $60.9 billion. Other major holders include Marathon Digital Holdings and Tesla, each with over $1 billion in Bitcoin holdings. For now, the stark rejection at Meta suggests that shareholder appetite for crypto diversification is limited among large-cap tech firms, even as more companies globally are beginning to see Bitcoin as a viable corporate reserve asset. Meta Steps Into Combat While Bitcoin may not be a top priority at Meta, AI certainly is. The social media giant recently partnered with defense contractor Anduril to create artificial intelligence-powered augmented and virtual reality gear for the US military. The main goal of the collaboration is to equip soldiers with advanced headsets that incorporate Anduril’s AI-driven Lattice command and control system. This platform aggregates and interprets data from thousands of sources to deliver real-time battlefield intelligence. According to Anduril, the gear will enhance soldiers' situational awareness and enable more intuitive control over autonomous systems. This will provide a new layer of immersion and decision-making capability during combat missions. The project is privately funded and forms part of the growing trend of repurposing consumer technologies for military applications. Meta has invested $40 billion into virtual and augmented reality technologies since pivoting to its metaverse ambitions in 2021, and is now leveraging its expertise in immersive tech for defense purposes. Anduril’s co-founder Palmer Luckey , who also founded Oculus VR, said the joint project is part of his vision to turn US troops into “technomancers” by using cutting-edge tech to dominate the battlefield. He revealed on X that their first public collaboration will be a system called EagleEye, which is intended to evolve into the Army’s next Soldier Borne Mission Command platform. This new partnership comes after Microsoft initially held a similar AR contract under the same military program using its HoloLens headset. However, Microsoft confirmed in February that Anduril took over the lead, though Microsoft will still provide cloud infrastructure. It is becoming clear that the ties between Silicon Valley and the US defense establishment are deepening. Last November, Meta revised its acceptable use policies to allow its Llama language models to be used in military and national security applications. Around the same time, Anthropic made its Claude AI models available to US defense agencies through Palantir’s AI platform, hosted on AWS. Meta’s AI Vision Diverges On the other hand, Meta’s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun is concerned that current artificial intelligence models fall short of truly replicating human intelligence, and suggested that a fundamental shift in training methods is required to close the gap. At the AI Action Summit in Paris earlier this year, LeCun shared four key traits that define intelligent behavior in animals and humans: understanding the physical world, having persistent memory, reasoning ability, and the capacity for hierarchical planning. He said that today’s large language models, which power popular AI chatbots, lack these essential capabilities and that simply adding new features to existing architectures isn’t enough. Instead, LeCun advocates for a much more sophisticated approach by using what he calls “world-based models,” which will enable AI systems to simulate actions and predict how the world would change as a result. He argues that these models should learn through abstraction, much like humans do, in order to operate in an unpredictable and complex physical environment. Meta started exploring new directions, including retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to enhance model outputs with external data, and its February release of V-JEPA, a non-generative model that learns by predicting missing parts of video sequences. Still, LeCun says the industry needs to move beyond pattern-matching and embrace deeper cognitive modeling. However, Meta is also grappling with internal challenges as its AI division experiences a talent drain . Business Insider reports that only three of the original 14 researchers who developed the company’s first Llama model remain after many moved to Mistral. The exodus took place amid a lukewarm response to Meta’s latest release, Llama 4, which struggled to keep pace with offerings from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. These competitors have rolled out models that are praised for more advanced reasoning and user experience. According to The Wall Street Journal, Meta also delayed the release of its next-generation Llama model, code-named “Behemoth.”",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9394/meta-shareholders-shut-down-push-for-bitcoin-treasury,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|AR","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-02T09:40:05,"UK-Listed Investments Platform IG Offers Spot Crypto Trading to Retail Customers","Investment platform IG (IGG) said it has begun offering crypto trading to retail investors, becoming the first publicly-listed firm in the U.K. to do so. This marks IG's first offering of crypto exposure through spot trading of bitcoin BTC, ether ETH and a range of smaller tokens. The company's crypto service has previously been confined to derivatives products in the form contracts for difference (CFD). IG has teamed up with U.S.-based crypto-focused fintech firm Uphold to build crypto trading into its existing platforms that customers currently use for dealing shares, FX, commodities and derivatives. This may demonstrate the increasing integration between traditional finance (TradFi) and digital assets that investors and traders now expect to see. The London-based firm's move also coincides with the ongoing development of the U.K.'s plans to establish a regulatory regime for the crypto industry. The government published two consultation papers in April on draft legislation for activities such as crypto trading and stablecoin issuance. IG shares are around 0.25% higher on the day at the time of writing, compared to the FTSE 100 index which is unchanged.

2025-06-02T09:35:20,"U.S Dollar to Slide Further This Summer, Bank of America Warns","Bank of America has warned that the U.S. dollar could be in for a rough summer, having already dropped sharply this year. The dollar index, which tracks the value of the U.S. dollar against major currencies, has dropped nearly 9% to 99.74 this year, as President Donald Trump's tariff war triggered a shift away from U.S. assets . Bank of America expects continued data-driven drubbing over the Summer. Weakness in the U.S. dollar is widely seen as positive for dollar-denominated assets, such as gold and bitcoin BTC. The global FX research team led by Athanasios Vamvakidis stated in a report to clients Friday that tariffs are more detrimental to the U.S. economy as the country trades more with the rest of the world than perhaps any other nation. The report acknowledged recent resilience in the U.S. economy and growth-supportive developments, such as President Donald Trump's tax cuts and the abandonment of extreme fiscal spending cuts, but stated that ""negatives dominate."" ""Policy uncertainty on multiple fronts remains. Companies may pause hiring and investment plans until there is greater clarity. In most scenarios, we see tariffs much higher than the starting point, with current levels being the minimum,"" the report said. It added that the market is reacting negatively to the loosening of fiscal policy at a time when debt levels are at record highs, leading to higher borrowing costs. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is unable to take significant action due to rising inflation expectations. ""Migration flows have collapsed. Demand increased in Q1 [front running] ahead of tariffs but may be about to fall,"" strategists noted, pointing to weakness in high-frequency indicators such as the ISM data and weekly Dallas Fed economic index. The weekly Dallas Fed economic index has resumed the downtrend following the brief spike in early April and hit the lowest since December, according to data source TradingView. ""Such high-frequency indicators tend to be very noisy but could still point to a slowdown of the economy in the coming months,"" strategists said.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/02/u-s-dollar-to-slide-further-this-summer-bank-of-america-warns,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|RESEARCH","Markets|Bank of America|Markets|Dollar|market analysis|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-02T09:33:29,"Big Week for Bitcoin: Key US Economic Data to Be Released This Week","The post Big Week for Bitcoin: Key US Economic Data to Be Released This Week appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market has been steady for the past two weeks, moving between $109,000 and $104,000 after reaching a new all-time high of $111,980. Even though Bitcoin had an 11% jump last month , the market is taking a break for now. As the new month begins, investors are turning their focus to important US economic reports that could affect the crypto market. Let’s see what these reports are! 2nd June: Fed Chair Jerome Powell Speech Today, June 2 , all eyes are on Jerome Powell, the head of the US Federal Reserve. He’ll speak in Washington at 1 pm, sharing his thoughts on how the economy is doing and what the Fed might do next with interest rates. His speech will likely influence market sentiment and could give clues on what lies ahead for Bitcoin. 3rd June: US Job Openings (JOLTS) On June 3, the latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) for April will be released. In March, job openings fell to 7.192 million, the lowest since September 2024. This came before the new tariffs announced by President Trump. Experts think these policies have slowed down hiring. If job openings keep falling, the Fed might consider lowering interest rates, which could boost Bitcoin. 4th June: ADP Non-Farm Employment Wednesday, June 4, will bring the ADP Non-Farm Employment report for May. In April, private companies added only 62,000 jobs, down sharply from 147,000 in March. Economists now expect 112,000 new jobs in May. If the figure falls short, it might show that the economy is slowing, which could boost Bitcoin as an alternative to the dollar. 5th June: Initial Jobless Claims Thursday, June 5, brings the weekly jobless claims report. For the week ending May 24, claims rose to 240,000, up from 226,000. This was the highest since November 2021, showing signs of a softer labor market. Renowned economists expect 232,000 claims for the week ending May 31. More claims could mean the Fed will try to support the economy, which might be good for Bitcoin. 6th June: Non-Farm Payrolls & Unemployment Rate Finally, June 6 will bring the Non-Farm Payrolls report and the unemployment rate. In April, 177,000 new jobs were added, keeping the unemployment rate steady at 4.2%. Economists now expect 130,000 new jobs in May. If job growth slows because of the tariffs, the Fed might change its approach.

2025-06-02T09:33:04,"Will Bitcoin (BTC) Lose Its Shine to Gold Again? Price Analysis","With Bitcoin (BTC) still losing ground after its surge up to the $112,000 all-time high, gold is currently breaking out of a bull flag. The two soundest money assets are interchanging as the go-to flight to safety, and it looks like it might be gold’s turn again. $BTC attempts breakout from falling wedge Source: TradingView In the short-term chart for $BTC might have just started looking up. The falling wedge chart pattern isn’t the most perfect, but if it is legitimate, a breakout could be taking place. If the bulls can now push the price up and beyond the $105,500 resistance, a return to more bullish price action could be the result. A failure to breakout could mean $BTC coming down to the $102,000 major support. $BTC cause for concern in weekly timeframe Source: TradingView The fly in the ointment for $BTC is the breakdown below the ascending trendline on the weekly timeframe which has just been confirmed. Add to this the cross down of the indicators in the Stochastic RSI, leaving plenty of cause for concern. On the positive side of things, the price is holding above the strong supports at $104,000 and $102,000. If this support can hold, and there is a strong surge, perhaps due to some catalyst, the price can quickly get back to the all-time high and turn the weekly Stochastic RSI indicators back around. Gold is staging a breakout Source: TradingView Meanwhile, the gold price is also staging a breakout. Since gold hit the all-time high on 22 April at $3,500, the price has chopped sideways and has formed a bull flag. Monday is witnessing the breakout of this flag. The measured move out of the flag is to around $3,700. BTC/XAU has started to reverse in favour of gold Source: TradingView The Bitcoin/Gold chart on the weekly timeframe is suggesting that it’s possibly time for gold to take back the reins from Bitcoin. The 38% rise for $BTC against gold foundered at the 32 ounce resistance, and this week’s candle falling below the ascending trendline is a sign that gold is going to come back into the limelight. The weekly Stochastic RSI is another factor in gold’s favour. The indicator lines look to be crossing back down, bringing upside price momentum on the side of gold. Looking ahead, what will be important is how far down this potential correction for $BTC against gold will go. If the correction goes below the previous swing low, this will signify that $BTC would be changing to a downtrend against gold. However, if BTC/XAU can hold the 25 ounce support and bounce from there, the trend would continue higher in Bitcoin’s favour. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

May was a blockbuster month for the crypto sector, headlined by unprecedented institutional investment, key legal developments, and heightened adoption by both private and public entities. Bitcoin BTC reached new all-time highs of $112,000 as corporate giants like Strategy (MSTR) purchased $2.7 billion worth of BTC in four tranches, while BTC spot ETFs absorbed $5.2 billion in inflows reflecting rising mainstream demand. Companies such as Trump Media & Technology Group and Twenty One Capital joined the wave, committing billions collectively to bitcoin treasury strategies. Notably, David Bailey’s Nakamoto Holdings raised $710 million to pursue a similar strategy following a reverse merger. Public firms like SharpLink Gaming and VivoPower announced significant private placements to launch Ethereum and XRP treasury strategies, signaling diversification beyond Bitcoin. At the state level, New Hampshire and Arizona became the first to pass strategic bitcoin reserve bills, underlining growing political endorsement. Regulatory clarity advanced, with the GENIUS Stablecoin Bill moving forward in the Senate, the SEC confirming that staking isn’t a security, and the OCC affirming that U.S. banks can legally buy, sell, and custody Bitcoin. Coinbase’s $2.9 billion acquisition of Deribit strengthened its derivatives position, even amid a major user data breach. Kraken’s move to launch tokenized stocks on Solana and the SUI network’s $200 million Cetus protocol funding further showcased Web3 innovation. Meanwhile, international players like Japan’s Metaplanet and France’s “The Blockchain Group” raised hundreds of millions to build bitcoin positions.

The value of the donation in question reaches approximately 45 million dollars (one billion Czech crowns). At the center of the scandal is Tomáš Jiřikovský, known as the founder of Sheep Marketplace, the Czech Republic’s largest dark web illegal marketplace to date, who was released in 2021. Jiřikovský was sentenced to nine years in prison in 2017 for embezzlement and drug dealing.

These devices included a Bitcoin wallet and access codes. At the time of Jiřikovský’s arrest, the cryptocurrency was worth around 20 million kronor (around $800,000), and with the rise in Bitcoin prices, it has now exceeded three billion kronor (around $130 million). The ministry has taken back around one billion kronor from this wallet. However, the National Center for Combating Organized Crime (NCOZ) has opened an investigation to see if the transfer was money laundering.

According to a new report by NBC News, former Goldman Sachs employee Tim Leissner has been sentenced to two years behind bars for paying a part in the multibillion-dollar heist. Prosecutors say that Leissner and others who worked for the banking giant aided Malaysia in raising $6.5 billion for the nation’s investment fund through bond sales. However, $4.5 billion of those funds were stolen, laundered via bribes and kickbacks, and used to purchase luxury goods and fund extravagant lifestyles. The report says the scandal was far-reaching and led to the downfall of then-Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak in 2018, who was later convicted of crimes connected to the scheme and sentenced to 12 years in prison. Leissner is due to report to prison on September 15th. He pleaded guilty in 2018 to bribing officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi. Says Leissner, “The funds raised more than a decade ago could have profoundly benefited the nation and its citizens. Instead, due to my greed – and the greed of those involved alongside me – they were misappropriated. What we did was unequivocally wrong, and I take full responsibility for my role. I deeply regret my actions, and if I could turn back time, I would undo them without hesitation.” Leissner’s sentence includes two years of supervised release after prison and a forfeiture of nearly $44 million.

2025-06-02T09:14:08,"Ethereum at a Crossroads While $2500 Support is in Prime Focus- Will This Result in an 8% Pullback?","The post Ethereum at a Crossroads While $2500 Support is in Prime Focus- Will This Result in an 8% Pullback? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In times when the Bitcoin price is experiencing huge volatility, Ethereum has chosen to maintain a steady and calm price action. After rising above $2000, the second-largest token has been failing to rise above a certain range. The token is consolidating around $2500, staying in an accumulation zone for the past 3 weeks. With the key support levels being around $2400 to $2310, the ETH price has seen multiple rebounds, which indicates strong buying interest. On the other hand, the price has also faced multiple rejections around $2700, which hints towards heavy selling pressure. What’s next? Will the Ethereum price continue to remain consolidated within the range? The ETH price is at a technical crossroads where the token displays both bullish and bearish scenarios. The short-term price action remains stuck within an extremely narrow range, and hence, a breakout from the pattern could only attract either the bulls or the bears. The ETH price in the STF shows the token failing to rise above the descending trend line, which is acting as a strong resistance. On the other hand, the Bollinger bands are also plunging and have begun to squeeze. Meanwhile, the Stochastic RSI has also plunged before marking the upper threshold, signifying the growing dominance of the bears. Therefore, the ETH price is required to break the descending trend line and secure $2600. However, securing the range above $2700 and $2715 may only validate a bullish reversal, as the token has faced multiple rejections from this level. In the worst case, a failure may break the pivotal support at $2450, and if the price does not trigger a rebound, a drop to $2300 or slightly lower could be imminent. Ethereum dropped by more than 45% in Q1 compared to 11.82% of Bitcoin. Meanwhile, the rise in ETH price is close to 40%, compared to 26% of that of BTC price, hence indicating the second-largest token outperforms Bitcoin in Q2. On the other hand, Sharplink Gaming is planning to buy Ethereum worth a billion dollars for its treasury along with the ETF accumulation. Meanwhile, the Ethereum price is rhyming with the 2021 breakout, which elevated the levels from $2500 to $4000. The ETH price is undergoing a similar consolidation, and hence, if history repeats, the token is primed to mark new highs in the coming months.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/ethereum-at-a-crossroads-while-2500-support-is-in-prime-focus-will-this-result-in-an-8-pullback/,"BTC|ETH|REGULATION|TRADING","Price Analysis|Ethereum",cryptocompare

2025-06-02T09:10:46,"The dubious story behind Ross Ulbricht's $30M donation: 300 Bitcoins traced back to old Silk Road wallets","Ross Ulbricht didn’t get handed 300 Bitcoin by some mystery savior. He sent the money to himself—at least, that’s what the author of this article thinks. Now, around twenty-four hours ago, shortly after Ross made a historic appearance at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, a wallet tied to the former Silk Road operator suddenly received 300 BTC, worth roughly $31.4 million. According to data tracked by blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence, the funds landed in a wallet that has been publicly linked to Ross. People quickly assumed it was another round of donations he’d been receiving since being released. Source: Arkham Ross’s belongings have gotten him around $1.8 million in Bitcoin after an auction at the event. One of the pieces, his final prison ID card, was sold for 5.5 Bitcoins, or $580,380. Sleuth connects mixer trail to old exchange wallets Crypto investigator ZachXBT has been on the fence about the donation story from the start. He pointed out that the 300 BTC didn’t come straight from an exchange or a new wallet. It was funneled through Jambler, a centralized Bitcoin mixer that most privacy-conscious users don’t even touch. “Interestingly the 300 BTC appears to come from Jambler outputs,” Zach said on X, adding, “Whereas normal privacy enthusiasts use decentralized mixers like Wasabi, Samourai, etc.” Zach dug deeper and came back to share that he’d found two wallets—1Mp5hHZNv9a5Lnu7DvKtFgpneEaVK7mj39 and 1CNDWv3gX5BvhcUxR7xCE9WTFZF7M5qR2P—that had been dormant since late 2014 and 2019, respectively. Both had past exchange activity, and one of them had even been flagged in compliance systems. Zach stated that both wallets began sending large deposits into Jambler between April and May 2025—right before the 300 BTC showed up in Ross’s donation wallet. “Few entities regularly use Jambler in size,” Zach wrote . “So I found a potential demix for the donation. 1Mp5hH originates from late 2014 exchange activity. 1CNDW has 2019 exchange activity and was previously flagged in compliance tools. Both had dormant BTC from Nov 2019 until the mixer deposits.” Zach concluded that the coins were sent from addresses that shared suspicious overlaps in activity, timing, and history. Crypto Twitter reacts with confusion and sarcasm Not everyone liked the idea that Ross might’ve just dusted off his own coins. One user replied, “You’re trying too hard dude, let Ross enjoy his donation.. We don’t care where it came from.” Zach shot back, “It’s $30M not $200K. Of course it’s interesting who sent it.” The user then said, “Wouldn’t it be sick if YOU were one of the very few people who actually knew and didn’t have to let ct or the feds in on it?” Zach responded, “Everyone was accusing Ross of a self donation so if anything this proves it was a donation and not his ‘secret stash’ because there was activity when he was away in prison.” Someone else wasn’t having any of it. “You have to be truly r*tarded to think Ross would send a ‘secret stash’ to his very public address,” they wrote. And another user piled on with, “You think DPR went to jail with no bitcoin left? My man is still stuck in 2012. 300 Bitcoin through a centralized mixer. LOLOL.” This user referenced a May 6 post by Sani, the founder of TimechainIndex that alleges activity from two Bitcoin addresses—1NWPS2fWw6FMeJEjg6DMMpYxQyB4TKpVsb and 1PiEKBgsBmCT4VuwFKLdGpXMNh99ebMPf—which together moved 3,422 BTC. Those coins were traced back to Silk Road origins through historic UTXO consolidations. Sani’s findings pointed to a 10,000 BTC transaction—TXID 53952c5a7c9f461d3e274cd92227df589d2ff7eea6eeae88a67868d58d08afcb—which fed into the addresses. Another batch of funds later flowed into wallet 1GA7hEmKv9L2mh5NCfgnLFufAb7bEMdnNS, coming out of a separate 19,940 BTC consolidation, tied to TXID b555a4399797c784033863dda38abef7b8adcaf6748e9519dcb175fb1d04ee0. That same 19,940 BTC was previously seized by US authorities after Ross’s arrest. The recent movement of those old addresses was the first in over 12 years, and while the identity of whoever moved the coins remains unknown, the wallets are clearly linked to Silk Road.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ross-ulbricht-300-bitcoins-from-old-wallets/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|ARKM","OP-ED|BTC|Silk Road",cryptocompare
2025-06-02T09:10:00,"Trump Tariffs Cause Shift to Short-Term Trading Strategies, Says Taoshi CEO","The imposition of trade tariffs by US President Donald Trump has significantly changed trading behaviors to prioritize quick, short-term profit-taking over extended position holding. This observation comes from Arrash Yasavolian, CEO and founder of the Bittensor-based Taoshi AI-enhanced trading platform, who notes a distinct pivot in investor approach. A Shift in Short-Term Traders In a recent interview , Yasavolian explained that the tariffs have introduced a new layer of headline-driven volatility across financial markets, leading to rapid and extreme shifts in sentiment, often within a single trading day. Yasavolian stated that “Trading behavior has essentially changed to be more intraday — when you have your profit, you just take it when you can get it.” He added that this indicates a cutting of confidence in sustained upside or downside movements when traders take long or short positions. Traders and investors are grappling with this evolving macroeconomic landscape, leading to a more cautious and agile approach to market participation. Trade Tariffs Shake Investor Confidence The ongoing trade tensions, particularly between the US and China , are being closely watched by crypto investors for any indication of a lasting trade deal. Analysts widely predict that such a resolution would trigger a sustained price rally across both altcoins and Bitcoin. Recently, there was a glimmer of positive news when President Trump announced on May 25 a delay in tariffs on European Union (EU) goods, extending the deadline to July 9. Crypto markets reacted favorably to this development, with the price of Bitcoin climbing by over 3% in an intraday move. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the EU Commission, commented on this extension in a May 25 X post, highlighting the “world’s most consequential and close trade relationship” between the EU and US, and affirming Europe’s readiness to “advance talks swiftly and decisively.” Despite these political reassurances of productive trade discussions and a potential resolution to the escalating tensions, some analysts remain cynical. They suggest that any perceived progress in negotiations, tariff exemptions, or softening of rhetoric might be illusory, primarily serving political optics rather than signifying substantive and lasting economic change.

2025-06-02T09:09:32,"LSE-listed IG Group opens Bitcoin, Ether, and memecoin spot trading in UK","United Kingdom-based publicly listed trading firm IG Group has launched spot cryptocurrency trading for retail investors. According to a June 1 announcement , IG customers can now access 31 digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, and a selection of altcoins and memecoins such as Bonk. IG Group’s first direct crypto offering IG Group is a London-headquartered financial services firm listed on the London Stock Exchange under the ticker IGG. Up until now, it only offered online trading and investment services across forex, indices, stocks, and commodities. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency exposure was limited to contracts for difference (CFDs), a derivative product that allows traders to speculate on price movements without owning the underlying asset. Unlike spot trading, CFDs do not involve actual crypto ownership, making the latest launch IG Group’s first direct offering of digital assets to its customers. The new crypto trading service is offered in partnership with Uphold, a U.S.-based cryptocurrency platform that is regulated in both the United States and the United Kingdom. Uphold will handle all customer transactions and provide pricing data, with its infrastructure fully integrated into IG’s trading platform and the IG Invest app, and users will be able to switch between crypto and other asset classes, including equities. IG UK Managing Director Michael Healy described the move as a significant milestone in Britain’s crypto journey, adding that retail investors can now engage in crypto trading “with a grown-up business.” The firm said the offering is part of its long-term strategy to meet evolving investor demands and position itself within the growing digital asset economy. Crypto regulations gaining momentum in UK IG’s new product launch comes at a time when UK regulators are advancing efforts to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. On May 28, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) launched a public consultation on proposed rules for stablecoin issuers and crypto custody providers. Under the proposal, the government plans to bring crypto activities in line with traditional financial standards. For instance, stablecoin issuers would be required to provide holders the right to redeem at par value, maintain clear disclosures on backing assets, and appoint independent custodians. Custody providers, meanwhile, would need to ensure assets are securely held and accessible at all times. David Geale, the FCA’s executive director of payments and digital finance, said the agency is committed to supporting innovation while fostering market integrity. The FCA also confirmed it is coordinating with the Bank of England, which is expected to release complementary guidance for stablecoins operating at a systemic scale later this year. These measures build on broader reforms unveiled by Chancellor Rachel Reeves in April. The UK Treasury announced a draft legislative framework under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Cryptoassets) Order 2025, introducing six new regulated crypto activities, including trading, custody, and staking. Meanwhile, tax authorities have also moved to tighten oversight of the sector . Starting January 1, 2026, crypto firms would be required to collect and report detailed user information, including names, addresses, dates of birth, and tax identification numbers, for all customers and transactions.

2025-06-02T09:08:41,"Bitcoin Struggles to Hold $105K After Strong Monthly Close","Bitcoin attempted to stabilize above $105,000 on June 1 following a strong monthly performance that saw an 11% gain for May. The cryptocurrency faced ongoing pressure throughout the week, bringing it back to key support levels established earlier in the 2024 bull market. Among these was the December 17 local high of roughly $104,450, which traders watched closely heading into the new week. Analyst Matthew Hyland labeled the weekly close as “pivotal” for the short-term trend. Hyland pointed to a developing bearish divergence between Bitcoin’s price and its relative strength index (RSI) on the weekly chart. RSI, which gauges momentum, appeared to weaken even as price attempted to climb—raising caution flags for traders. Bearish Divergence Raises Concerns Trader Titan of Crypto echoed those concerns, warning his followers that a potential RSI bearish divergence was forming. “Still unconfirmed but worth watching,” he posted on May 31, alongside a chart referencing Fibonacci-based fair value gaps (FVGs). These gaps often indicate price areas where trading activity was unbalanced, and two key FVG zones were highlighted at $97,000 and $90,000. Titan added, “After a +50% run, a cooldown wouldn’t be a bad thing. Healthy market structure matters.” $100K Level Could Act as Magnet CrypNuevo, another trader analyzing order book data, suggested that $100,000 could serve as a price magnet if selling pressure continues. “It’s a strong psychological level and liquidity tends to stack in these levels,” they noted, anticipating a possible retest. Despite Bitcoin’s 8% decline over the past week, CrypNuevo remained bullish on the broader trend. “So I think we’ll probably drop to $100k and play around there for some days… even a slight temporary drop below it to shake the market would make sense,” they predicted. They concluded that overall market structure remains bullish, with the bull market support level near $84,000 closing in from below.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/bitcoin-struggles-to-hold-105k-after-strong-monthly-close/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

Most altcoins are with minor gains today, including HYPE, which has posted a 3% increase. XMR leads the larger-cap alts with a 6% surge. BTC Aims at $106K The all-time high registered on May 22 was followed by a violent correction on the following day when US President Trump warned that the EU might face another set of tariffs. Although the two parties reached some sort of an agreement and the tariffs were delayed for over a month, BTC failed to recapture its momentum and was stopped at $110,000 on a couple of occasions during the previous business week. It continued to trade sideways until Friday evening, when Trump blamed China for violating their trade agreement. Beijing responded almost immediately, and bitcoin slumped by several grand. The culmination transpired on Saturday when BTC slipped to $103,100, which became a 12-day low . However, it maintained that level on Sunday and even recovered some ground to around $104,000. During the Monday morning Asian trading session, BTC added a few more grand and tapped $106,000, where it faced some rejection and now sits about $500 lower.

Monero’s native token has gained the most from the top 60 alts, as a 5.4% increase has pushed it to over $345. Other impressive performers include FLR, SPX, and FARTCOIN.

During his session, Garlinghouse spoke about one of the biggest mistakes he believes people in the crypto space continue to make. “It’s not about the 300 million people already in crypto doing more — it’s about getting 3 billion more people involved,” he explained, urging the industry to shift its focus from internal rivalries to global adoption. “The Bitcoin community is not our enemy — they really are not. If they do well, we’re going to do well. We might do better. It’s just like, it’s not a zero-sum game. And I think the one thing I learned — I was in Silicon Valley for 24 years — the one thing you learn is tech is not a zero-sum game. We’re going to grow the pie,” he added. Garlinghouse also hinted at Ripple’s expanding vision beyond its native token. Discussing Ripple’s acquisition of a prime brokerage and deeper involvement with traditional finance players, he opened up about how the company is positioning itself at the intersection of crypto-native innovation and Wall Street strategy. According to him, DeFi won’t simply replace traditional finance — the two need to work together. Ripple has spent nearly a decade bridging that gap, especially through its payments business. He said this is a long-term journey that will play out over several years. The community has been very patient as Ripple has faced some tough challenges. The Hidden Road acquisition is about building stronger connections between traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi). The Ripple CEO’s comments come at a time when market narratives often pit crypto communities against one another. His remarks serve as a timely reminder that in an industry still fighting for mainstream adoption, unity could be the real competitive edge.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-community-is-not-xrp-armys-enemy-declares-ripple-ceo-brad-garlinghouse/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|XRP","News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

2025-06-02T08:48:33,"Cardano crosses 110M total transactions but technicals signal more downside","Cardano has surpassed 110 million total transactions, marking a significant milestone in the blockchain’s ongoing growth. As of press time, the network has recorded 110.09 million transactions, according to Cardanoscan data . This shows consistent adoption and usage throughout its ecosystem. Furthermore, nearly 22 billion Cardano ( ADA ) are currently staked in 2,992 active stake pools, indicating a strong community involvement in network upkeep and security. ADA’s market performance has remained strained despite the rising network activity. With a modest 0.9% increase over the previous day, the token is now trading at $0.6811. However, ADA is still down more than 11% over the past week. Over the last day, it has recorded $541 million in trading volume, which represents an 8.5% increase. This shows rising market activity, though not necessarily in a bullish direction. In the derivatives market, open interest has increased by 2% to $818 million while trading volume is up by over 13% to $1.14 billion. This rise in leverage suggests that more traders are betting on ADA, possibly in expectation of more volatility or directional movements. You might also like: SEC delays Grayscale’s Avalanche and Cardano ETF decisions to July From a technical perspective, most momentum and trend indicators suggest the path of least resistance is still down. ADA is trading below major moving averages, such as the 10, 20, 50, and 200-day levels, all of which indicate that the bearish trend will continue. Cardano price analysis. Credit: crypto.news The downward pressure is supported by the negative moving average convergence divergence. At 38, the relative strength index is bearish but not yet in oversold territory. Further declines, perhaps toward the $0.65 region, could be possible if the $0.67 support area breaks. On the other hand, a short-term reversal might occur if the price is able to bounce back and close above the $0.72 range. Meanwhile, development activity on the Cardano network has been steady. The Cardano Foundation released its 2025 Ecosystem Guide in late April, which featured practical applications in industries like real estate and supply chain. Around the same time, on Apr. 20, Input Output Global announced a collaboration with BitcoinOS to introduce decentralized Bitcoin ( BTC ) rollups to Cardano through zero-knowledge proofs. The implementation is anticipated to take place later this year. In another update, Brave confirmed in May that it has integrated ADA support into its browser wallet, and the beta version is now available.

2025-06-02T08:46:32,"CZ suggests building a ‘dark pool’ for DEX perpetual futures after James Wynn’s major loss","Former Binance CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao suggests building a pool for decentralized perpetual futures that keeps orders hidden until the transaction is completed to avoid mass liquidations. Recently, high-risk whale James Wynn suffered $100 million losses in liquidated high-leveraged positions. In a recent post , the head of YZi Labs urged budding on-chain builders and innovators to reach out to him if they are interested in bringing his idea into reality. The Binance founder believes it is “a good time” for the crypto space to have its own “dark pool perp DEX .” Typically, decentralized exchanges make all on-chain trades and orders visible to everyone. In the case of perpetual DEXs, which let you trade leveraged contracts, this means that every trader can also see all positions and liquidation points happening in real-time. According to Zhao, this poses a problem because long positions started by traders attempting to purchase large amounts of coin would be visible to other traders. The position would become a big red target for other traders intent on pushing the market to liquidate it. They could buy more tokens to make the position’s value go down before it closes or they would take advantage of the opportunity to launch MEV bot attacks in the pool. “This results in increased slippage, worse prices, and higher costs for you,” said CZ. Given recent events, I think now might be a good time for someone to launch a dark pool perp DEX. I have always been puzzled with the fact that everyone can see your orders in real-time on a DEX. The problem is worse on a perp DEX where there are liquidations. Even with a CEX… — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) June 1, 2025 As a result, CZ believes there should be a pool that keeps orders and trades hidden from other traders to prevent huge losses occurring while the transactions are being processed. He believes it could be achieved by not opening the order book to all traders or by keeping deposits into smarts contracts hidden until after the transaction is completed. CZ remarked that this sort of solution has already been implemented in traditional finance, where institutional traders are able to make large purchases invisible to other entities using “dark pools.” These pools are essentially private trading venues that do not make trades publicly visible until after they are executed. “Even with a CEX order book, where orders aren’t linked to a specific individual, if you’re looking to purchase $1 billion worth of a coin, you generally wouldn’t want others to notice your order until it’s completed,” said CZ. Zhao’s statement follows a chain of long position leverages which have resulted in disastrous losses for the traders involved. You might also like: CZ says we need more dApps after new chains crash On May 31, prominent high-risk, high-reward crypto trader James Wynn, known for opening high-leverage positions on-chain, suffered substantial losses when the market turned on him. After Wynn was seen opening a 40x-leveraged Bitcoin ( BTC ) position valued at $46.4 million, and one on Pepe ( PEPE ) worth $16 million, the price of BTC fell from a record high of $111,900 to $101,911 when he liquidated. Not only that, PEPE also plummeted from $0.00001625 to $0.000025. This led to Wynn closing his leveraged Bitcoin trade with a loss of $37 million and his Pepe trade was liquidated with a loss of over $858,580. The recent liquidations, which totaled about $100 million this week, marked a major loss for Wynn. Another similar incident occurred back in March, when a group of traders banded together to launch a “ man-hunt ” to liquidate a whale’s BTC short position valued around $450 million on Hyperliquid. Many of the large-scale positions that went viral this year were launched on the Layer 1 DEX Hyperliquid.

The company disclosed that the average purchase price for this latest batch was 15.5 million yen per Bitcoin, bringing the total transaction value to approximately 16.88 billion yen, worth $117.5 million. Metaplanet Ramps Up Bitcoin Treasury Play In its latest update , the company stated that its overall average purchase price now stands at 13.75 million yen per Bitcoin, with the total aggregated amount spent reaching 122.269 billion yen. Following this purchase, Metaplanet’s total holdings have increased to 8,888 BTC. This move continues Metaplanet’s strategy of strengthening its position in digital assets. Inspired by the business intelligence firm, Strategy’s corporate Bitcoin playbook, and Michael Saylor’s leadership, Metaplanet adopted its BTC treasury strategy in April 2024. Since then, it has rapidly built one of the largest BTC holdings. It now leads in Asia and is the tenth-largest public company globally that owns Bitcoin. The Japanese firm’s most recent acquisition brings it closer to its ambitious 10,000 BTC target for 2025. Metaplanet shares rose 9.75% on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today, closing at 1,171 yen at 3:30 PM JST. According to Yahoo Finance data , the stock is up over 236% year-to-date. $21M Bond Deal Last month, Metaplanet announced the issuance of $21 million in zero-coupon bonds to Evo Fund, after closing a separate $50 million funding round. Labeled the 17th series, these bonds have a face value of $525,000 each and mature on November 28, 2025. Because they bear no interest, Metaplanet avoids incurring any borrowing costs. The issuance terms allow Evo Fund to redeem the bonds early, either entirely or in increments of $525,000, by providing five days’ notice. These early redemptions may also coincide with subsequent funding activities involving the same investor. As unsecured instruments with no guarantees or third-party administrators, the bonds comply with Japan’s corporate legal framework. Payment procedures will be managed at the company’s Tokyo office. The financing move is in line with Metaplanet’s broader goal of accumulating Bitcoin without diluting shareholder equity.

2025-06-02T08:20:00,"Pi Network Price Prediction 2025-2031: Will Pi Price surpass previous ATH?","Key Takeaways: Pi price faces bearish pressure below the $0.65 resistance. Our Pi network price prediction expects the Pi price to surge to a maximum level of $1.42 in 2025. In 2031, Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $4.84. Pi Network has entered a period of instability since the final KYC verification deadline on March 14, 2025. Users who failed to verify and transfer their tokens to the mainnet lost access to their Pi holdings. The transition was completed on Pi Day, blockchain upgrades were introduced, and PiFest was launched to help more people use Pi. While some transfers went smoothly for users, others experienced problems and unexpected losses. These complications contributed to sharp price fluctuations. Adding to the pressure, more than 102 million Pi tokens were moved from OKX recently, signalling strong selling activity. Despite this, Pi Network continues to push ecosystem growth. Additionally, the recent launch of a $100 million venture fund aims to support dApp development on the Pi blockchain. While these developments could support long-term value, short-term sentiment remains cautious. In this outlook, we’ll assess how Pi’s price has responded to recent events and provide an informative Pi network price prediction model from 2025 to 2031.

MACD shows slight bullish divergence, but the signal line still holds downward dominance. RSI is near 40, indicating weak momentum. The Pi Network price has shown slight stabilization on June 2 after recent losses, trading at around $0.6415 with a minor loss of 0.2% in the last 24 hours. The MACD remains below the signal line, signaling continued downside momentum and a lack of bullish strength. The RSI is at 39, trading below the neutral 50 mark. This indicates weak buying interest and market hesitation. As price action struggles to reclaim higher levels, the broader market shows consolidation, reflecting caution among investors awaiting a decisive shift in trend. Pi price analysis 1-day chart: Bearish momentum dominates as indicators stay weak On the 1-day chart, Pi Network continues to trade under bearish pressure, with the price moving around $0.64. The market structure shows a consolidation, with both side traders struggling to validate a clear move. PI/USDT Chart on TradingView The MACD indicator reinforces this view, with the MACD line still trending below the signal line. Despite slight histogram contraction, there is no confirmed bullish crossover, suggesting that downward momentum may persist in the short term. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits around 40.5, showing weak bullish momentum and confirming low buyer activity. This places Pi in a bearish momentum zone, with no clear sign of reversal yet. Pi/USDT 4-hour price chart The 4-hour chart for Pi Network (PI/USDT) shows a struggle among buyers to hold the price above EMA trend lines. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 39.21, indicating weak bullish momentum and room for further downside. PI/USDT Chart on TradingView A bullish crossover on the MACD suggests a potential shift in sentiment. Key resistance lies near $0.66, while $0.60 acts as strong support. A sustained move above resistance could confirm a short-term trend reversal.

The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.72 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly—neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Is Pi A Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.66 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly—neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is the Pi Price Down Today? Pi Coin is down today due to growing investor exits, as shown by large exchange inflows and insufficient demand to support price stability. Will Pi Price Reach $5? If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $5 mark. Will Pi Reach $10? Depending on the current market sentiment, the PI price might take several years to reach the $10 milestone. We expect the Pi price to achieve $10 by 2033.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History: Coinmarketcap Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction it was still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 in over-the-counter or sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. April 2025 Pi network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. May 2025 , the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi shows sideways-to-bullish movement, with potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72 if support at $0.60 holds.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/pi-network-price-prediction/,"ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network",cryptocompare

Bitcoin advocate Ethan Peck pushed the plan, arguing it would hedge against inflation. More public companies, including GameStop and Tesla, continue adding Bitcoin to their treasuries. Meta shareholders have overwhelmingly voted down a proposal to explore adding Bitcoin to the company’s balance sheet, according to a May 28 regulatory filing. The so-called “Bitcoin treasury assessment” proposal received just 3.92 million votes in favor — representing only 0.08% of the total — while nearly 5 billion shares voted against the measure. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who holds 61% of the company’s voting power, likely voted against it. Bitcoin Advocate Urged Meta to Invest Part of $72B Cash in BTC The proposal originated from Bitcoin advocate Ethan Peck, who in January urged Meta to allocate a portion of its $72 billion cash reserves into Bitcoin, calling it a potential hedge against inflation. “Since cash is consistently being debased and bond yields are lower than the true inflation rate, 28% of Meta’s total assets are consistently diminishing shareholder value,” Peck argued in his supporting statement. He also pointed to BlackRock’s guidance suggesting a 2% Bitcoin allocation as reasonable. Peck, who submitted the proposal on behalf of his family’s Meta shares, serves as Bitcoin director for the wealth management firm Strive.

Microsoft shareholders voted against Peck’s proposal in December . Amazon shareholders are expected to vote on a related measure — proposing a 5% Bitcoin allocation — in the coming months. Analysts note that while some Big Tech firms remain cautious about adding volatile crypto assets to their balance sheets, the landscape is shifting globally. Public Companies Continue to Invest in Bitcoin Meanwhile, the number of public companies holding Bitcoin continues to grow. According to data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET, 116 public firms have now added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Recent additions include GameStop and Swedish health tech company H100. MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 580,250 BTC worth approximately $60.9 billion. Other major holders include Marathon Digital Holdings and Tesla, both with over $1 billion in Bitcoin. As reported, digital asset companies are flooding capital markets to raise funds for large-scale Bitcoin acquisitions , spurred by the cryptocurrency’s rally to a record $111,965 last week. The surge, up more than 50% from early April, has ignited a wave of listings and mergers as firms race to secure funding while investor appetite remains strong. Last week, Trump Media & Technology Group confirmed plans to raise $2.5 billion to buy crypto, joining a growing list of firms mimicking MicroStrategy’s blueprint. Just recently, French crypto holding company Blockchain Group announced plans to purchase an additional $72 million worth of Bitcoin following a successful €63.3 million bond sale, as it expands its aggressive treasury strategy.

Saylor has seen his influence steadily grow over the past two years, largely due to Strategy’s aggressive corporate treasury strategy centered around Bitcoin . Strategy Bitcoin Acquisition The company’s most recent Bitcoin acquisition on May 26 saw it add 4,020 BTC, valued at approximately $427 million at the time of purchase. This brought Strategy’s total holdings to a staggering 580,250 BTC. According to data compiled by Bitcoin Treasuries, this positions Strategy as the single largest known Bitcoin holder. Its BTC reserves significantly outweigh the combined holdings of the US and Chinese governments.

While authors like Adam Livingston have characterized Strategy as an emerging financial superpower due to its substantial Bitcoin holdings, not all investors are entirely convinced by the reported accumulation figures. Scrutiny Over Holdings and Transparency Concerns A growing segment of market participants has expressed skepticism and suspicion regarding Strategy’s reported Bitcoin treasury , citing a notable absence of regular proof-of-reserve audits. This lack of transparency has led some to question the veracity of the company’s claims. One individual, responding to Saylor’s recent acquisition post, directly challenged him, stating that “No proof of reserves is your preferred ‘trust me bro,'” and further questioned the presence of the Bitcoin on the mempool or if it was merely “paper Bitcoin.” In response to such criticisms, the Strategy co-founder has consistently argued that conducting proof-of-reserve audits for large enterprises and institutions carries inherent risks. He contends that such audits could expose the institutions’ wallets to unwanted tracking and attention from potential threat actors.

2025-06-02T08:08:08,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk Announces New Feature for X! Bitcoin (BTC) Detail Attracts Attention!","Tesla CEO Elon Musk, one of the most influential names in the cryptocurrency market with his posts and statements, made a new post from his X account. Elon Musk said that the social media platform's new messaging feature, XChat, is now live, will use Bitcoin (BTC)-style encryption, and will support all file types. Musk announced that XChat has been released with Bitcoin-style encryption, end-to-end security, disappearing messages, voice and video calling, and support for all file types. All new XChat is rolling out with encryption, vanishing messages and the ability to send any kind of file. Also, audio/video calling. This is built on Rust with (Bitcoin style) encryption, whole new architecture. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2025 Musk's statement that this feature is built on Rust with Bitcoin-style encryption and has a completely new architecture has sparked a backlash from Bitcoin developers and cryptography experts. Bitcoin Core developer and OCEAN CTO Luke Dashjr responded to Musk's post by saying, “Bitcoin doesn't even use encryption.” JAN3 CEO and Bitcoin supporter Samson Mow echoed the same sentiment, saying, “Bitcoin is not encrypted.” Musk’s statement comes after Telegram CEO Pavel Durov last week claimed that Telegram had entered into a year-long partnership with Musk’s xAI, including a $300 million payments and app integration deal. Musk responded by saying, “No agreements have been signed.” Related News: Elon Musk Denies News! Toncoin (TON) Price Dropped as Fast as It Rises! *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-02T08:00:51,"Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will XRP Reach $5?","The post Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will XRP Reach $5? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights The XRP Price LIVE: $ 2.15450635 . Predictions suggest XRP could reach $5.05 by the end of 2025. Long-term projections show XRP could hit $26.50 by 2030 and $526 by 2050. XRP, one of the top 5 assets known for its cross-border solutions, has seen tremendous adoption and fame since President Trump took office in the US. Even the XRP price prediction is gaining serious attention as Ripple XRP shows strong bullish signals across the market. With institutional adoption like from banks are rising, on-chain metrics heating up, and ETF odds are higher in 2025. Moreover, Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC nearing its end, many investors are asking: Will XRP reach 100? Could the XRP price prediction of $500 actually happen in the long run? This article would answer those question’s dive into XRP price prediction 2025, 2026-2030. Table of contents CoinPedia’s Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025 XRP Price Today XRP Crypto Price Prediction May 2025 XRP Price Prediction 2025 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 XRP Price Prediction 2026 Ripple Price Prediction 2027 XRP Price Prediction 2028 XRP Price Prediction 2029 XRP Price Prediction 2030 Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis Institutional XRP Price Targets for 2025 FAQs CoinPedia’s Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025 With regulatory clarity from the SEC case and Ripple accelerating its expansion, we at CoinPedia are optimistic about the XRP forecast. We expect the XRP coin price to reach $5.81 in 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 XRP Price Today Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 2.15450635 1.11% Market cap $ 126,598,198,571.55 Circulating Supply 58,759,724,027.00 Trading Volume $ 1,938,129,229.4924 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Crypto Price Prediction May 2025 XRP is currently pulling back after testing a declining trendline at $2.65 in mid-May. Throughout the rest of May, it dipped below a high-volume profile level. In the early days of June, XRP is attempting to hold above last month’s swing low of $2.10. If XRP manages to rebound and break through the strong resistance at $2.40, it could pave the way for a rally toward $2.80 and potentially retest its all-time high at $3.40. However, a continued drop below the $2.10 support zone could push the price further down toward $1.88 and $1.63. Additionally, rising volatility indicates that XRP’s previously dull and consolidative price action may soon give way to significant movement. Still, low trading volume remains a concern, as it reflects weak market participation—an essential ingredient for sustaining any strong momentum. However, if both volatility and volume begin to rise along with strong buying conviction, XRP could witness a significant price surge in June. XRP Price Prediction 2025 If XRP successfully breaks its all-time high of $3.40 in May 2025—a major supply zone on the chart—it could realistically target $5 by year-end, fueled by growing optimism from banks , institutions, and potential ETF support. Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD , is now integrated into its cross-border payments system, Ripple Payments, further strengthening its position in global finance. Notably, institutional dominance is evident, with the top 100 addresses holding 70% of the circulating supply, positioning XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $138 billion. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.05 $3.45 $5.05 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.50 6.25 8.50 2027 7.00 9.0 13.25 2028 11.25 13.75 16.00 2029 14.25 16.50 21.50 2030 17.00 19.75 26.50 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP cost will likely witness strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.50 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum price of XRP will be around $5.50, with an average trading price of $6.25. Ripple Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP coin price will range between $7.00 to $13.25. XRP price might record an average level of $9.00. XRP Price Prediction 2028 As per our XRP price prediction 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases. We expect the XRP future price to range between $11.25 to $16.00. The average trading price of Ripple could be around $13.75. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The price of XRP might record a trading range between $14.25 to $21.50, with an average price of $16.50. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The XRP prediction 2030 depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the Ripple coin price could scale between $17.00 to $26.50. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.75. Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Based on historic price sentiments and XRP’s rising popularity, here are the XRP future price projections for 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, and 2050. Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2031 25.00 29.50 35.25 2032 31.50 36.75 41.25 2033 35.75 42.25 47.75 2040 97.50 135.50 179.00 2050 219.25 331.50 526.00 Market Analysis Firm Name 2025 2026 2030 Changelly $2.05 $3.49 $17.76 Coincodex $2.38 $1.83 $1.66 Binance $2.16 $2.27 $2.76 Institutional XRP Price Targets for 2025 Name Target Standard Chartered $5.50 Sistine Research $33 to $50 Final Thoughts: Is XRP Still a Good Investment? Yes, XRP is still a good investment for those with a long-term view. With the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit nearing settlement, increasing institutional interest, and rising on-chain activity, XRP’s fundamentals remain strong. The integration of RLUSD and potential ETF listings further boosts its utility and market potential. While short-term volatility may persist, XRP price prediction models point to significant upside. If regulatory clarity continues, XRP could be well-positioned to reach ambitious targets like $100—or even higher—in the coming years. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!
