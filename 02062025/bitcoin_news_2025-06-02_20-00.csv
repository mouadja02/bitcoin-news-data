2025-06-02T17:51:15,"France’s Crypto Kidnap Crisis: 25 Indicted Over Mutilation and Million-Euro Ransom Horror","Key Takeaways: French authorities charged 25 suspects in violent crypto kidnapping cases. Criminals are using delivery trucks to access secure areas without being challenged. High-value crypto holders face rising physical extortion risks globally. On May 31, Paris prosecutors charged 25 suspects in a string of crypto-linked abductions, including a foiled kidnapping attempt targeting Paymium CEO Pierre Noizat’s family. The cases, marked by severed fingers and €7M ransom demands, reveal a brutal new front in crypto crime. At least three high-profile abduction plots have been disrupted since May, all targeting French crypto executives or their relatives. Prosecutors warn that the tactics, which include physical mutilation, reflect an escalating threat to digital asset holders. NEW: France Charges 25 Suspects in Connection to Crypto Abduction Cases According to the report, the suspects are all ages 16-23, including 6 minors charged. More than three firms specializing in crypto insurance and security are now preparing tailored kidnaps. pic.twitter.com/ykWrEo1fmg — Crypto Trends (@Crypto_Trends_) June 1, 2025 How Delivery Van Disguises Are Fueling Crypto Kidnappings According to a local media report , the charges are linked to an attempted abduction that took place on May 13. In a bold daylight attack near a school, the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the CEO of crypto firm Paymium, were nearly kidnapped by assailants posing as delivery drivers. The attackers used a van marked with the branding of French courier delivery service Chronopost to blend in. The attempt failed due to the intervention of a bystander and the victim’s companion. @Valeurs | Ce mardi matin, deux personnes proches de l'univers de la cryptomonnaie ont fait l’objet d’une tentative d’enlèvement en plein Paris.

Prosecutors also pointed to other failed crypto kidnapping plots, including a prior attempt on the same targets the day before. This also included a disrupted scheme near Nantes just last week. So far, 18 suspects have been placed in pre-trial detention. Three have requested to delay their court hearings, and four others are under judicial supervision, which requires them to follow strict rules while awaiting trial. France has witnessed a disturbing rise in such incidents, and recent headlines reflect the scope of the problem. On May 1, the father of a young online poker player, who had earned millions through crypto trading and live streaming, was kidnapped in Paris’s 14th arrondissement. Four attackers disguised as UPS delivery workers used a stolen van to abduct the victim. A ransom of €5–€7 million was demanded via wire transfer. To coerce the son into transferring the requested sum, they severed one of the victim’s fingers and recorded the act. The victim was later rescued in Palaiseau during a coordinated police operation. Another similar case was reported in January. David Balland, co-founder of the crypto hardware company Ledger, and his wife were kidnapped in the Cher region of France. The attackers reportedly severed one of Balland’s fingers and recorded the brutal act. They then sent the video to his business partner, Eric Larchevêque, along with a ransom demand. According to Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau, the kidnappers requested payment in cryptocurrency and managed to collect part of the ransom.

They are now part of a growing criminal playbook targeting high-profile figures in the digital finance sector. As crypto assets gain value and visibility, so does the risk for those who own them. Global Hotspots Where Crypto Kidnappings Are Surging France may be in the spotlight, but it’s far from the only country facing this trend. Crypto kidnappings are on the rise worldwide. From South America to North America, Europe to Asia, criminals target digital asset holders with alarming boldness. In the U.S., two NYPD officers were placed on modified duty last week . Investigators are examining their possible involvement in a crypto kidnapping case involving an Italian national in Manhattan. New: The NYPD stripped 2 detectives of their guns /badges & placed them on desk duty after the dept. learned they'd had been working security for William Duplessie & John Woeltz, the crypto investors recently arrested for allegedly kidnapping a man & torturing him. @CBSNewYork pic.twitter.com/BBsS9uVR2U — Tim McNicholas (@TimMcNicholas) May 29, 2025 The victim was allegedly held for 17 days, tortured, and forced to give up access to a Bitcoin wallet. On May 23, a young Russian couple was kidnapped in Buenos Aires, Argentina. They were held until a $43,000 Bitcoin ransom was paid . They were later released. Meanwhile, the U.S. charged six men in February linked to the October 2024 kidnapping of four Chicago residents. The victims were forced to transfer $15 million in crypto . Just a month before that, a UK court sentenced seven gang members to lengthy prison terms for kidnapping and torturing a crypto investor . The operation was an attempt to extort digital assets. One of the most high-profile cases in Canada involved WonderFi CEO Dean Skurka. He was kidnapped during rush hour in Toronto in November 2024 and released after reportedly paying a $1 million ransom . Crypto abductions have cracked the safety net of digital finance. They show that the risks of holding valuable digital assets extend beyond phishing emails and password theft. They can reach into homes and families, threatening personal safety. Governments are intensifying their fight through cross-border investigations, tighter regulations, and advanced technology tracking. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How are criminals identifying crypto targets? Some scour social media for targets. Others leverage data from hacked cryptocurrency exchanges, such as the latest Coinbase data dump on the darknet. Why aren’t crypto abductions prosecuted as terrorism? These kidnappers aren’t political. They’re part of profit-driven crime rings, hunting crypto wealth through brutal but businesslike schemes.

Outlines His Plans!","Cardano (ADA), one of the largest altcoins in the cryptocurrency market, experienced a major attack after Donald Trump's presidential victory. While ADA continues to make a name for itself with its 100 percent rise, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson made a bold prediction for Bitcoin (BTC). Hoskinson predicted at the recent Bitcoin Conference that Bitcoin could reach somewhere between $250,000 and $500,000 in the coming years. Hoskinson also shared Cardano’s latest expectations for the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, including plans to integrate XRP into its growing ecosystem. Noting that Bitcoin is a store of value from the strength of DeFi, he said the shift towards BTC is accelerating. Reiterating three long-standing and defining principles for Bitcoin, Hoskinson listed them as “all transactions must use only Bitcoin, fees must be paid in BTC, and returns must come only from Bitcoin.” Hoskinson said that these rules help protect Bitcoin’s identity but make DeFi integration extremely difficult, and that’s where Cardano comes in. At this point, Hoskinson stated that they have developed the technology to enable DeFi integration and connect BTC and DeFi without changing the essence and identity of Bitcoin. Charles Hoskinson also confirmed that Cardano is working to incorporate XRP into the DeFi ecosystem and wants to leverage XRP’s strong reputation for cross-border payments. Finally, Hoskinson added that this integration could help create a seamless, scalable multi-chain ecosystem where Bitcoin, XRP, and Cardano can work together, increasing financial access and inclusivity around the world. *This is not investment advice.

Reveals the Secret of Its Success!","New statements came from Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, who stands out with his strong predictions about Bitcoin (BTC) and the cryptocurrency market. This time he talked about one of the largest altcoins, Ripple – XRP. On this point, Matt Hougan recently praised XRP and emphasized the strength of its community. Hougan stated that he believes XRP’s success can primarily be attributed to the strength of the community behind it. According to Hougan, who stated that he gave a keynote speech at the XRP Las Vegas event from his X account, the conference venue was filled with 1,000 people at 1:00 pm ET on Saturday. That number was impressive, according to Hougan, as early Saturday afternoon events tend to draw fewer people, but the XRP community showed its strength and filled the venue. The Bitwise CIO was asked about the key takeaways from the conference, to which Hougan responded by comparing Bitcoin and XRP. At this point, the Bitwise CIO stated that the XRP community is increasingly accepting that Bitcoin and XRP are not direct competitors, and that both XRP and Bitcoin serve different markets. “I think the XRP world has embraced the idea that BTC and XRP serve different markets and that BTC’s development will not disrupt XRP’s goals. But mostly, it's just the power of the community. That's a huge piece of success in crypto, and the community in XRP is strong.” Bitwise CIO previously predicted that if XRP manages to gain a significant foothold in sectors like payments and tokenization, its price could rise to around $30 after a decade. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-02T17:34:17,"Here’s why this MSTR stock ETF has crashed 82% in 2025","Strategy stock price has jumped by 27% this year, beating Bitcoin, which has jumped by almost 12%. Meanwhile, a small leveraged ETF tied to the stock, Defiance Daily Target 2x Short MSTR ETF (SMST), has plummeted to a record low of $29, marking an 82% decline from its January levels. The ETF holds over $42 million in assets. SMST vs MSTR vs Bitcoin | Source: SeekingAlpha This sharp underperformance is due to SMST’s design: it seeks -2x the daily percentage change of Strategy stock (MSTR). In other words, it is structured to rise when Strategy stock falls—and to decline when the stock is in an uptrend. You might also like: Strategy stock price moves into a correction: will it rebound? For example, on Monday, June 2, MSTR stock rose 1.30%, while SMST dropped 2.50%. Other leveraged MSTR ETFs have also lagged behind its stock this year. The Defiance Daily Target 2x Long MSTR ETF has dropped by 4.5% while the T-Rex 2X Long MSTR Daily Target ETF has also dropped by 6.4% this year. These funds have struggled largely because Strategy stock has declined more than 12% from its highest level this year, despite remaining up year-to-date. Inverse leveraged ETFs like SMST are risky Historically, leveraged inverse ETFs underperform their benchmark assets. For example, the ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ ETF or SQQQ has crashed by 97% in the last five years. In contrast, the ProShares UltraPro QQQ or TQQQ has jumped by 242% in the same period. The SMST ETF will likely continue falling since analysts anticipate that Bitcoin ( BTC ) will do well in the long term. Ark Invest sees Bitcoin jumping to $2.4 million by 2030, while BlackRock expects that it will hit $700,000. If these estimates are correct, it means that Strategy stock will jump in the long term because the company holds almost 600,000 Bitcoins, a number that is increasing weekly. The other risk for SMST ETF is that it is highly expensive, with an expense ratio of 1.29%. In contrast, popular ETFs like the Vanguard S&P 500 and iShares S&P 500 charge just 0.03%. This means that a $10,000 invested in SMST will charge an annual fee of $129, while the S&P 500 funds charge just $3 a year.

2025-06-02T17:30:52,"Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse says Bitcoin is not the enemy","CEO of Ripple Labs, Brad Garlinghouse, surprised the entire XRP community and much of the wider crypto community when he said, “Bitcoin is not the enemy,” at the XRP Las Vegas 2025 conference. Many people did not expect Garlinghouse to support Bitcoin and its community because he strongly criticized its flaws for years. Because he changed his opinion, people are now questioning whether he is genuine or if his moves are just for political and industry support, especially now when cryptocurrency is under pressure from governments and traditional banks. While some believe he wants to unify the crypto world to push back against tight regulations and a banking system that still controls most global finance, others worry that he might be giving in to Bitcoin maximalists. Whatever the reason, Garlinghouse’s new message is bold, and it could reshape how people view Ripple and XRP in the larger crypto conversation. Ripple and Bitcoin communities have long clashed Ripple and Bitcoin supporters have disagreed on what makes a good cryptocurrency for over a decade. The XRP community has long said Bitcoin still depends on proof-of-work mining that consumes large amounts of electricity and handles fewer transactions per second, while their token solves real-world problems by being faster, more scalable, and far more energy-efficient. Garlinghouse described Bitcoin’s mining model as outdated and harmful to the environment, and he has repeatedly said XRP is better suited for building a real, usable financial system on the blockchain. On the other hand, Bitcoin maximalists claim XRP is centralized, controlled by Ripple Labs, and serves banks instead of empowering individuals. They call the token a “banker coin” and say it goes against the original vision of crypto, which was meant to remove middlemen, not work with them. Maxis also points to the long legal battle with the SEC as proof that XRP isn’t a trustworthy or decentralized cryptocurrency. Ripple’s peace gift to Bitcoin supporters stirs mixed reactions Brad Garlinghouse donated the Skull of Satoshi to the Bitcoin community days before the XRP Las Vegas 2025 conference began. Some people praised the move as a way of acknowledging past conflicts while signaling a new willingness to collaborate. At the same time, some Bitcoin maximalists saw it as a sign that Ripple and its supporters finally recognized Bitcoin’s dominance. Others said the peace offering showed that XRP needed Bitcoin more to succeed in cryptocurrency. In one post, a user said, “Ripple tried to replace Bitcoin for 10 years. Now they’re offering us skulls like it’s ancient Rome.” Another viral tweet said, “When you lose the war, at least bring a gift.” However, XRP loyalists had mixed reactions because some interpreted the move as a sign that Ripple was rising above petty arguments and positioning itself as a unifier in the industry. In contrast, others worried that the gesture made Ripple look weak. Garlinghouse makes a risky but strategic move Brad Garlinghouse’s new tone toward Bitcoin could be a carefully calculated strategy that allows him to build stronger alliances as the US government and financial regulators scrutinize digital assets. He may also want to prepare Ripple for upcoming discussions with financial institutions and governments that want to integrate blockchain technology on condition that they see signs of stability and professionalism. However, critics argue that Garlinghouse might be extending a hand that won’t be accepted, making his gestures look like weakness instead of strength. The biggest risk is within Ripple because the brand has always positioned XRP as an efficient, scalable, and low-cost alternative to Bitcoin, and its supporters stood proudly against what they saw as Bitcoin’s flaws. Garlinghouse’s latest message muddies the line between rival and partner, and a growing number of XRP fans feel like the company is gradually retreating from the principles that made it unique, which muddles and frustrates its base. Supporters who once believed XRP would overtake or replace Bitcoin may now wonder if the goal has changed and Ripple could lose its loyal following by trying to appeal to both sides.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/did-ripple-just-surrender-to-bitcoin-maxis/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MINING|REGULATION|XRP","OP-ED|Bitcoin|Ripple",cryptocompare
2025-06-02T17:30:16,"Bitcoin Vs. M2: Abra CEO Sees $130,000 As Liquidity Floods In","Bill Barhydt, the founder and chief executive of crypto-banking platform Abra, set Crypto-X alight over the weekend by reposting a collage of global M2-versus-Bitcoin charts first popularised by macro investor Raoul Pal and researcher Julien Bittel. “I’ve seen over a dozen posts with different versions of the global liquidity M2 vs Bitcoin price chart – I’ve attached several here. Credit @RaoulGMI and his colleague @BittelJulien for discovering the trend,” he wrote. “Most of these charts predict a dip over the coming days to around $100 k and then a move to new ATH of $130 k in August/September … Or this could all be horseshit. Whatever.” Will Bitcoin Follow M2? Expanding on the macro backdrop, Barhydt argued that “global liquidity needs to rise significantly in the coming months. Bitcoin remains the mother of all liquidity (re: debasement) sponges.” He framed the asset’s reflexivity in stark terms: as fiat supply grows, Bitcoin absorbs the monetary excess, and the resulting gains “will most likely spill over into other L1 platforms and then ultimately speculative alts – the proverbial alt season.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Tipped For $340,000 Target If This Support Level Holds – Details Even so, he cautioned traders against complacency. “Watch your leverage, touch grass and please please be civil,” Barhydt advised, noting that the anticipated pull-back could be a gentle pause or a swift capitulation toward $95,000 before any summer rally materialises. When a follower fretted that the model might already be overcrowded, Barhydt dismissed the idea that positioning had reached critical mass: “I’ve thought about that but we’re talking about trillions of dollars and billions of people. There might be thousands of people focused on this but not more. Even then retail writ large isn’t focused on crypto right now.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Warning: Bull Trap Or $270,000 Rocket? Analyst Exposes What’s Coming A second critic complained that the liquidity data “is not collected on a timeframe that would predict daily moves.” Barhydt concurred, replying: “I completely agree. Hence the ‘whatever’ reference. It’s macro directional on a weekly scale at best. But in that regard it’s been a very good tool.” The liquidity-first thesis still has heavyweight backers. Pal recently told Real Vision subscribers that “liquidity is the single most important driver of all asset prices,” estimating that rising world-money supply accounts for up to 90% of Bitcoin price action, while Bittel’s latest update pegs global M2 near a record $111 trillion – a level he says leaves Bitcoin “still going higher.” Whether those macro tailwinds propel Bitcoin to the $130,000 target or prove, in Barhydt’s own words, to be “horseshit” will depend on how briskly central banks resume balance-sheet expansion and how aggressively traders deploy leverage in the weeks ahead. For now, Barhydt’s call serves as both roadmap and reality check: the next swing could be explosive, but the model is only as good as the liquidity it tracks. At press time, BTC traded at $104,625.

In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the project’s official account stated that while they’ve been “working closely with exchanges,” the process has required “a bit more time to finalise.” To show appreciation for early adopters, Bitcoin Pepe is now offering a 30% bonus to all current holders who participated in the presale phase. Bitcoin Pepe @BitcoinPepe_ · Follow Presale AnnouncementWe’ve been working closely with exchanges, but as these things go, they need a bit more time to finalise. Therefore, our listing announcement is now set for June 17th, with more info coming 🗓️To thank our early supporters, we’re giving a 30% bonus to 8:00 PM · Jun 2, 2025 48 Reply Copy link Read 14 replies With the listing just two weeks away, excitement is building among investors who see the coin as one of 2025’s most promising meme tokens. The announcement follows a highly successful presale, during which Bitcoin Pepe raised over $13 million, signaling strong early investor confidence in the project’s potential. Why CEX Listings matter for Bitcoin Pepe A centralized exchange (CEX) listing is a major milestone for any crypto project, and for Bitcoin Pepe, it could be the spark that launches the coin into the mainstream. CEX listings provide increased liquidity, visibility, and accessibility, opening the door to a wider audience beyond the DeFi-savvy crowd. Most retail investors still rely on centralized platforms to purchase crypto, meaning that listing on a top-tier exchange could significantly boost trading volume and market awareness. The June 17 listing could mark the moment Bitcoin Pepe transitions from meme coin cult favorite to broader market contender. What makes Bitcoin Pepe an attractive pick for 2025 While meme coins are often associated with hype over substance, Bitcoin Pepe is trying to stand out by building a strong community and capitalizing on broader market tailwinds. Its branding, merging the internet’s beloved Pepe character with the gravitas of Bitcoin, has struck a chord with a new generation of crypto investors looking for high-upside plays with viral potential. Add to that the fact that the crypto market is heating up again. With the Federal Reserve expected to resume cutting interest rates in the second half of 2025, and Bitcoin itself pushing toward new highs after months of consolidation, the macro environment is turning bullish. If Bitcoin rallies, it tends to lift the entire market, and meme coins, often the most speculative of all assets, typically see explosive gains during these phases. What could drive future demand for Bitcoin Pepe Bitcoin Pepe isn’t just another meme coin – it’s the world’s only Bitcoin meme ICO, aiming to merge viral internet culture with serious blockchain innovation. The project is building Solana on Bitcoin, introducing a Meme Layer-2 that features instant transactions, ultra-low fees, and a new PEP-20 token standard to support scalable, fun applications on the Bitcoin network – all of which could further improve its demand and lead to a higher price target moving forward.

2025-06-02T17:25:15,"Why Bitcoin’s next short-term target is $120,000","Although Bitcoin ( BTC ) is consolidating, a trading expert projects that the asset is poised to break out toward $120,000. In this case, prominent online analyst TradingShot pointed out that Bitcoin nearly touched its four-hour 200-period moving average ( MA ) on Saturday, a critical support level since April 16. In a June 2 TradingView post , TradingShot noted that after testing this level, BTC immediately rebounded. While the bullish reaction has been moderate since price action remains capped below the four-hour 50-period MA, there are compelling reasons to expect an imminent breakout. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Specifically, the formation of a blue Arc pattern over the past three weeks mirrors the price behavior seen during previous peaks and pullbacks since Bitcoin’s early April bottom. These Arc patterns have historically signaled significant upward momentum once the price breaks above resistance. Adding to the bullish case, the four-hour Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) dipped into oversold territory for the first time since April 7. This condition suggests Bitcoin may be primed for a sharp reversal as buyers capitalize on discounted prices. Bitcoin’s next price target Even the weakest rally of this long-term bullish leg has seen gains of at least 16.06%. If the 4H MA200 continues to hold and Bitcoin breaks above the 4H MA50, TradingShot anticipates a minimum short-term rise of 16.06%, pushing BTC to approximately $120,000. As reported by Finbold, TradingShot previously suggested that historical price movements indicate that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by late 2025. Meanwhile, pseudonymous analyst El_crypto_prof highlighted a familiar chart setup in an X post : a final small dip before a powerful surge. With BTC hovering above $104,000, he identified $102,000 as a prime entry point and $97,000 as the critical floor for this bullish scenario to unfold. Bitcoin price analysis chart.

Bitcoin one-week price chart. Source: Finbold Despite the consolidation, Bitcoin’s technical structure remains bullish, with the price significantly above its 50-day simple moving average ($98,885) and 200-day SMA ($86,995).

Strategy has acquired 705 BTC for ~$75.1 million at ~$106,495 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 16.9% YTD 2025. As of 6/1/2025, we hodl 580,955 $BTC acquired for ~$40.68 billion at ~$70,023 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF https://t.co/K4tex3qHrN — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 2, 2025 This purchase was funded by proceeds from the company’s active at-the-market (ATM) offerings of its preferred stock classes, STRK and STRF. The purchase period spanned from May 26 to June 1, 2025, and marks another milestone in the company’s long-running Bitcoin accumulation strategy. The firm now holds a total of 580,955 BTC acquired for an aggregate purchase price of roughly $40.68 billion, representing an average purchase price of $70,023 per bitcoin. This latest buy reflects Strategy’s ongoing commitment to its Bitcoin-centric corporate treasury strategy, where excess capital, including proceeds from equity offerings, is consistently redeployed into the cryptocurrency. With this move, Strategy also disclosed a bitcoin yield of 16.9% year-to-date, reinforcing its position as the largest corporate holder of BTC globally. The timing of this acquisition, at a higher average price compared to its long-term cost basis, suggests that Strategy views Bitcoin’s recent rally as a sign of longer-term strength rather than a peak. ATM Programs Fuel Expansion During the same period, Strategy said it has made use of its ATM equity programs to raise funds for both operational and investment purposes. Between May 26 and June 1, the company raised a total of $74.6 million across its ATM programs: $36.2 million from the sale of 353,511 STRK shares and $38.4 million from the sale of 374,968 STRF shares. These preferred stock instruments, each carrying attractive dividend yields of 8.00% and 10.00% respectively, were established earlier this year and have already shown strong traction in the market. As of June 1, there remains substantial capacity within these programs for future issuance—$20.68 billion for STRK and $2.05 billion for STRF—indicating Strategy’s intent to continue leveraging these instruments for growth and BTC accumulation. The company also declared quarterly cash dividends on both series of preferred shares, with STRK shareholders receiving $2.00 per share and STRF shareholders receiving approximately $2.64 per share. These payments are scheduled for June 30, 2025, to shareholders of record as of June 15. The dividend on the STRF shares includes an accrual from the issuance date of March 25, further underlining the firm’s attention to maintaining shareholder value alongside its bitcoin-centric strategy. K33 Says Strategy Slows Bitcoin Buys as MSTR Premium Shrinks K33 Research reports that Strategy appears to be easing its pace of Bitcoin acquisitions. In its latest filing, Strategy revealed it bought 4,020 BTC between May 19 and May 25 for $427.1 million, using proceeds from its ongoing $21 billion at-the-market (ATM) offering. However, capital raised from the program has slowed. Only $348.7 million was deployed during that week—down from $705.7 million the week prior and $1.31 billion in early May. K33 Head of Research Vetle Lunde attributes the deceleration to two key factors: a declining premium for MSTR shares relative to the firm’s Bitcoin holdings, and intensifying competition among corporations entering the Bitcoin treasury space. “The pace of ATM utilization is notably slower than the first round,” Lunde noted. Between early November and mid-December, Strategy raised an average of $2.13 billion weekly. In contrast, recent averages have dropped to $788 million.

2025-06-02T17:08:53,"Latest Development on Saudi Prince’s $100 Million Investment in XRP","In a major development shaking the crypto landscape, a Saudi prince , Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Saud, has reportedly executed a landmark $100 million investment in XRP. This move, initially reported by Times Tabloid , has drawn global attention as it signals deepening institutional and sovereign interest in the digital asset space. According to the latest official announcement by VivoPower International PLC on its X account, the prince’s acquisition will happen through a strategic partnership with BitGo, one of the world’s leading digital asset custody providers. This collaboration ensures that the prince’s ambitious entry into XRP is securely handled, leveraging BitGo’s world-class infrastructure and treasury solutions. BitGo @BitGo Enters Strategic Partnership with VivoPower $VVPR to Facilitate its Initial US$100 Million XRP Acquisition for Treasury Strategy 𝗥𝗘𝗔𝗗 https://t.co/wi4KosTMH0 pic.twitter.com/Tmm3OArx5E — VivoPower (@Vivo_Power) June 2, 2025 BitGo’s Pivotal Role in Facilitating the Investment BitGo’s reputation in the digital asset space cannot be overstated. As a global leader in digital asset custody, BitGo brings multi-signature security, regulatory compliance, and advanced treasury management capabilities, which are crucial for institutional investors. The platform processes more than $1 billion in transactions monthly and is particularly geared toward helping institutional clients integrate crypto into traditional financial operations securely. By partnering with VivoPower, BitGo has effectively provided the operational backbone to facilitate the prince’s $100 million XRP acquisition. This collaboration marks a vital moment not only for the involved parties but also for the broader crypto market, demonstrating how institutional-grade custodianship can enable sovereign and high-net-worth investors to navigate the crypto industry. VivoPower’s Expanding Crypto-Focused Treasury Strategy VivoPower has been steadily advancing its digital asset strategy over the past year. Through its subsidiary, Tembo e-LV, the company has already made headlines by announcing that it would accept payments in Bitcoin (BTC), XRP, and Dogecoin (DOGE) for its electric vehicles. This progressive step reflects VivoPower’s belief in digital currencies as both a medium of exchange and a treasury reserve asset. In its public statement, VivoPower emphasized that the prince’s XRP acquisition aligns with its broader treasury strategy : holding portions of reserves in digital assets while applying prudent market assessments and risk controls. This approach is designed to enhance the company’s financial flexibility and capture the potential upside in the fast-growing crypto sector. Ripple’s Growing Global Footprint The prince’s investment in XRP arrives at a time when Ripple, the company behind XRP, is rapidly expanding its global presence. Ripple has established numerous partnerships with financial institutions, payment providers, and fintech hubs worldwide to push the adoption of blockchain-based solutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Notably, Ripple recently announced a collaboration with South Korea’s BDACS to strengthen institutional custody services for XRP and RLUSD, Ripple’s dollar-backed stablecoin. These global partnerships continue to strengthen XRP’s standing as a bridge currency for cross-border transactions, a role that significantly differentiates it from many other cryptocurrencies in the market. Institutional and Sovereign Confidence in XRP While retail investors have long been engaged with XRP, the entrance of sovereign players such as a Saudi royal into the ecosystem is a powerful endorsement. This investment signals growing confidence in XRP’s long-term utility, particularly for cross-border payments and liquidity management. Moreover, it suggests that sovereign wealth, family offices, and institutional treasuries are increasingly looking to diversify into digital assets, recognizing them not only as speculative instruments but as essential components of modern financial portfolios. A Landmark Moment for the Crypto Market The BitGo-VivoPower partnership facilitating this $100 million XRP acquisition by a Saudi prince marks a watershed moment in the institutionalization of cryptocurrencies. It demonstrates how far the industry has matured, with sophisticated infrastructure now available to support even the most demanding investors. As digital assets continue to embed themselves into global financial frameworks, such high-profile investments are expected to accelerate, signaling a new era where cryptocurrencies like XRP are no longer fringe instruments but foundational components of modern treasury strategies.

The bill aims to implement tax reforms, reduce government spending and advance elements of President Trump’s “America First” agenda. Says George Saravelos, head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, “We see this legislation as creating the scope for the US administration to transform a trade war into a capital war if it so wishes, a development that is highly relevant in the context of today’s court decision constraining President Trump on trade policy… It is not unreasonable for the market to conclude that if the President is constrained on using trade policy, taxing foreign capital could be a new means of leverage.” Saravelos says that the provision attempts to use taxation on foreign investors as leverage to advance American economic priorities, and only has to meet a low bar before being enforced. Elias Haddad, a strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., also told Bloomberg that the bill would “deter foreign investment.” “A foreign tax provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is alarming… If the bill as presently written takes effect, it would deter foreign investment in US assets at a time when the country faces increasing reliance on foreign capital to finance its ballooning debt.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-02T16:45:46,"Expert Says $10,000 XRP Holders Will Soon Tell This Millionaire Story","Edoardo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy, recently presented a compelling perspective on what he believes will shape the success narratives of XRP investors in the years ahead. In a post shared on X, Farina stated that early holders of XRP who made significant personal and financial sacrifices will one day be regarded as visionaries, even though the mainstream may attribute their eventual success to mere chance. Farina remarked that future observers might hear stories such as, “Years ago, I sold my car to buy 10,000 XRP,” and assume these investors were simply fortunate. However, he emphasized that this overlooks the effort and conviction required to invest in XRP at a time when confidence in its potential was not widespread. According to Farina, these individuals will not have achieved their success through luck, but rather through belief and the willingness to take risks. One day, those who got rich from XRP will say, ‘Years ago, I sold my car to buy 10,000 XRP.’ And the world will call them lucky, without understanding the risk it took. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) May 28, 2025 The Importance of Early Commitment Despite strong fundamentals and notable developments in adoption, XRP has remained below its all-time high of $3.84, recorded over seven years ago. Currently trading near $2, the asset continues to face resistance even as other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, advance to new all-time highs. This has tested the patience of long-term holders, particularly those who anticipated far higher returns based on projections of $10, $100, or even $1,000 per XRP. Farina suggests that accumulating 10,000 XRP—an investment that could have cost approximately $5,000 just months ago—might one day lead to significant wealth. If XRP were to reach $100 per unit , holders at this level would achieve millionaire status. Farina has encouraged the crypto community to aim for this threshold, warning that current prices may soon be out of reach. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Support for the Narrative Farina’s message received support from others within the XRP community who also view early investments as a matter of conviction rather than luck. One X user, Fiora, responded, saying , “On the surface, it seems to be “lucky and rich”, but in fact it is the result of early believers taking risks that ordinary people cannot bear.” This comment aligns with Farina’s position, reinforcing the idea that many early investors made bold choices that most people would have been unwilling to take. Counterpoints from the Community However, not all reactions were supportive. A user identified as Sun Shine questioned the optimism surrounding XRP’s long-term potential. In their comment, they stated the coin has not been earning for the longest time, drawing attention to the asset’s prolonged underperformance in comparison to its peers. This criticism highlights the broader frustration felt by some holders who expected higher returns by now. Farina’s belief that statements like “I took the risk and bought 10,000 XRP” will become part of future millionaire success stories underlines a larger debate within the crypto space. While some see XRP as a long-term investment built on vision and endurance, others remain skeptical due to its stagnant price action. Nonetheless, Farina and his supporters continue to assert that risk-takers who committed early will eventually be recognized not for their luck, but for their foresight and persistence.

2025-06-02T16:34:42,"Hackers Drain Force Bridge in $3M Crypto Heist","Force Bridge, a Nervos Network-based cross-chain platform, had suffered a significant crypto heist. Announced on June 2, the Web3 security company Cyvers said the hackers stole over $3 million of crypto assets. This attack comes just days after Magickbase, a key Nervos partner, announced plans to shut down the bridge due to low activity and high maintenance costs. Hackers Struck Force Bridge Before Shutdown Plans According to Cyvers’ X post, the hackers drained over $3 million across multiple digital assets. The hackers stole 257,800 USDT, 539.09 Ethereum, worth about $1.35 million, and 898,300 USDC. The bad actors reportedly siphoned 60,400 DAI and 0.79 wrapped Bitcoin, worth around $83,000. After the theft, Cyber revealed that the stolen funds were quickly converted into Ethereum. The criminals also used Tornado Cash, a crypto-mixing tool known for laundering stolen funds . The system hides the funds’ transactions, making tracking difficult. Magickbase, the Singapore-based infrastructure firm that helps manage Force Bridge, quickly stepped in. The team paused the bridge to prevent further damage and confirmed an ongoing investigation in an X post. This incident came just two days after Magickbase announced that Force Bridge would be shut down. The reason was low user activity and high costs of keeping the bridge running. The shutdown plan was shared in a notice published on May 31. This decision may have signaled a vulnerability window to attackers. What Is Force Bridge? Nervos Network launched in 2019 and created Force Bridge, a tool for moving crypto between different blockchains using smart contracts and token wrapping. This innovation makes trading and sharing easier between blockchains. A group called Magickbase helps build and manage the Force Bridge. They support developers and make sure the system works well. Nevertheless, security experts have warned that bridges are susceptible to attacks. These bridges use smart contracts to lock tokens on one chain and issue new ones on another. If these contracts have weaknesses, hackers can manipulate the system and siphon large amounts of crypto. The Bigger Problem with DeFi Crypto Heist Force Bridge is not the only bridge that has been hacked. Many decentralized finance (DeFi) bridges connecting different blockchains have suffered major attacks in recent years. In 2022, hackers stole $600 million from the Ronin Bridge , which disrupted its operations at the time, and $323 million from the Wormhole Bridge. In 2024, Orbit Chain similarly lost over $81 million. Just like in the Force Bridge case, the attackers used Tornado Cash to hide their stolen crypto. In April 2025, hackers failed to break into LayerZero’s Stargate bridge. This shows that security remains a big problem for DeFi bridges.

A filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under number 001-42210 shows the firm wants to use this purchase to support its growth outside Hong Kong. Reitar Logtech says the move updates its treasury strategy and helps it handle changing financial conditions. By adding Bitcoin to its reserves, the company aims to back further development in its logistics technology platform. The SEC filing makes clear that digital currency will serve both as a store of value and as a way to react to shifts in global markets. Kin Chung Chan, Director, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer of Reitar Logtech, signed the document submitted to the SEC. The company states that investing in Bitcoin is intended specifically to strengthen its logistics technology business. “This strategic treasury diversification initiative underscores our commitment to maintaining a strong financial foundation while scaling our global logistics technology platform,” said Reitar Logtech Chairman and CEO John Chan, according to the filing. He added, “By exploring Bitcoin treasury allocation, we aim to fortify our financial position while aligning with digital transformation trends in the supply chain industry. This potential initiative provides enhanced flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions and expand into new markets.” Reitar announces BTC acquisition while Strategy buys again On the same day, Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) announced it purchased 705 BTC at a cost of $75.1 million. Strategy now holds 580,955 BTC, with a total value of over $60 billion. Despite these moves, Wall Street remains skeptical. This week, Trump Media said it would raise $2.5 billion to buy Bitcoin, and GameStop announced a $500 million Bitcoin investment. A newcomer, Twenty One, backed by Tether, SoftBank, and Strike’s Jack Mallers, launched with plans to hold 42,000 BTC from the start, which would make it the third-largest corporate Bitcoin holder worldwide. Shares of Trump Media fell more than 20% after its announcement, while GameStop’s stock dropped 17%. Investors appear unconvinced that these Bitcoin-focused strategies will pay off in the near term.

Through this “BTC Program,” Reitar seeks to acquire up to 15,000 BTC from a consortium of institutional and high-net-worth investors in exchange for company shares, based on average BTC and stock market prices. The initiative is designed to strengthen Reitar’s balance sheet and provide flexibility for acquisitions and digital infrastructure investment, especially across high-growth Asian markets. Management believes this strategy will help reduce exposure to traditional asset risks while supporting the company’s long-term vision for global logistics innovation. Chairman and CEO Dale Shen emphasized that integrating digital assets into Reitar’s financial strategy represents a bold step toward a more robust and adaptive corporate treasury, enabling accelerated technological progress and future-proofing Reitar’s global operations. VivoPower Partners with BitGo for $100 Million XRP Treasury Strategy VivoPower International PLC has formed a strategic partnership with BitGo to support its newly launched $100 million XRP acquisition plan as part of a broader digital asset treasury strategy. The company will utilize BitGo’s 24/7 OTC trading desk and industry-leading custody platform to purchase and store XRP tokens securely.

2025-06-02T15:56:35,"Magickbase and Cyvers sound the alarm about Nervos breach","In what seems to be a security breach, the Nervos Network’s cross-chain bridge, Force Bridge, has been reportedly taken over by a suspicious account, which has so far resulted in the theft of approximately $3 million in digital assets. The breach is the latest incident where the vulnerabilities of a blockchain’s interoperability solutions have been exploited, raising concerns about the security of cross-chain protocols. Magickbase and Cyvers sound the alarm about Nervos breach One of the first alerts came from Magickbase, a developer of Nervos-integrated desktop wallet software. In a post shared on X (formerly Twitter), the team said it had picked up on unusual activity on Force Bridge and immediately shut down related services to protect users. “We’ve detected abnormal activity on #ForceBridge and have paused the service as a precaution. Our team is investigating,” Magickbase wrote, assuring its users that more information would be shared as it becomes available. Shortly after the post, blockchain security firm Cyvers Alerts published a more detailed breakdown of the breach. According to their analysis, a suspicious address has taken over the bridge and launched unauthorized movement of assets out of the Nervos network. 🚨ALERT🚨Our system has detected multiple suspicious transactions involving @NervosNetwork . A suspicious address appears to have taken control over the bridge, stealing ~$3M in assets: 257.8K $USDT 539.09 $ETH 898.3K $USDC 60.4K $DAI 0.79 $WBTC All funds were swapped to $ETH and… pic.twitter.com/jA3EZVpTeN — 🚨 Cyvers Alerts 🚨 (@CyversAlerts) June 2, 2025 So far, the only communication from Nervos itself has been a repost of Magickbase’s initial warning. According to Cyvers, the attacker converted the stolen tokens into Ethereum and began funneling the funds through Tornado Cash, a crypto “mixer” that scrambles transaction trails to make the origin and destination nearly impossible to trace. This kind of laundering is all too familiar, and Tornado Cash has increasingly been used as a go-to tool for cybercriminals looking to clean stolen funds. And once the money hits Tornado, recovery becomes a long shot. A bigger problem in the blockchain world Unfortunately, this incident is just the latest in a growing pattern. Cross-chain bridges have become some of the most attacked pieces of infrastructure in the crypto ecosystem. High-profile hacks like those on the Ronin and Binance bridges have made headlines; other exploits, like those involving Orbit Chain, Socket, and ALEX bridge, have also cost users millions of dollars over the past year. Force Bridge was supposed to be part of Nervos Network’s broader vision of secure, scalable blockchain interoperability. The network has been widely praised in the past for its hybrid design, combining Bitcoin’s UTXO model with smart contract functionality. In a 2024 Messari report , Nervos CKB was even called a potential “game-changer” for blockchain programmability. But as this breach demonstrates, even technically sophisticated networks are only as secure as their most exposed component. This has also brought to light the ongoing debate surrounding the use of tools like Tornado Cash . The argument that it offers legitimate privacy benefits for users may not continue to hold water with its continuous use by bad actors to launder large amounts of stolen funds and complicate tracking efforts.

Here is the Latest Multi-Million Dollar Hack Incident!","Nervos Network’s cross-chain protocol Force Bridge has been hit by a decentralized finance (DeFi) attack, causing the loss of over $3 million in cryptocurrencies, according to analysis by Web3 security firm Cyvers. Nervos Network's Force Bridge Hacked: Over $3 Million in Crypto Stolen According to security researchers, the attackers seized approximately 257,800 USDT, 539.09 ETH (about $1.35 million), 898,300 USDC, 60,400 DAI, and 0.79 wrapped Bitcoin worth approximately $83,000. Most of the stolen assets were converted to Ethereum and transferred through the Tornado Cash mixer, which is often used to cover up the tracks. Following the attack, infrastructure company Magickbase, which makes significant contributions to the Nervos ecosystem, announced that it has stopped its bridge service and launched an investigation. The company made a statement on June 2 on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) stating, “Our team is investigating the incident.” Singapore-based Magickbase is known as one of the main partners providing infrastructure support to Nervos Network’s developers and users. The company recently announced plans to terminate its Force Bridge service as of May 31, citing low user activity and high maintenance costs. Nervos Network, whose mainnet was launched in 2019, aims to increase cross-chain interoperability and create an integrated blockchain ecosystem with tools such as Force Bridge. DeFi bridges like Force Bridge work with smart contracts and “token wrapping” technologies that allow for the transfer of assets and data between isolated blockchains, but these systems are frequently subject to hacker attacks due to their complex structures and security vulnerabilities. Notable past examples include the Ronin Bridge attack in 2022, where $600 million was stolen, and the Wormhole attack, where $323 million was stolen. Such incidents once again reveal how fragile DeFi bridges can be in terms of security. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Hacking Incidents Never End in the Crypto Industry!

The move quickly drew attention across the crypto community. Specifically, some speculate that the coins could be part of Ulbricht’s hidden Silk Road stash, suggesting a self-donation. However, crypto investigator ZachXBT pushed back on these claims. According to him, the funds originated from wallets that utilized Jambler, a centralized Bitcoin mixing service.Likely Source of the 300 BTCZachXBT revealed that the addresses had histories dating as far back as 2014 and 2019 and had remained dormant until activity resumed between April and May 2025. Both addresses deposited significant amounts into Jambler shortly before the 300 BTC donation was sent to Ulbricht.ZachXBT explained that while the transaction probably isn't a self-donation, as some have alleged, it raises concerns due to its origin from a flagged address associated with questionable sources. He also emphasized that privacy-focused users typically opt for decentralized mixers, not centralized ones like Jambler.https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1929378278214906145Meanwhile, it’s worth noting that Ulbricht has already cashed out the disputed 300 BTC. Data from Arkham shows he withdrew the tokens to an external wallet 24 hours ago. That wallet now holds only $1,968 in crypto. Ross Ulbricht Bitcoin wallet activity Silk Road Ties Still Under the MicroscopeUlbricht, who was arrested in 2013 and sentenced in 2015 to a double life sentence plus 40 years, served 11 years in prison before receiving a pardon from U.S. President Donald Trump in January 2025. Despite his release, wallet activity connected to Silk Road continues to draw scrutiny.In January, Coinbase director Conor Grogan reported discovering 430 BTC worth over $45 million in long-dormant wallets he believes are linked to Ulbricht.These funds have remained untouched for over 13 years and were never seized by authorities. Arkham Intelligence later validated Grogan’s assessment, tying 14 wallets to Silk Road activity , including one holding over $9 million in BTC.https://twitter.com/jconorgrogan/status/1882046613709115875Beyond DonationsUlbricht recently held an online auction featuring personal belongings from his pre-arrest and prison life.

Bitcoin traded lower over the past week, dropping from over $110,000 on May 27 to slightly above $104,000 by June 2. However, amid this short-term stagnation, attention has shifted to long-term projections, particularly from social media figure Bitcoin Dad, who continues to promote an ambitious price target for the asset.Tracking Momentum Amid Boring Price ActionWhile Bitcoin’s price has hovered above $100,000 for 25 consecutive days, Bitcoin Dad described the market as “boring.” https://twitter.com/bitcoin_dad/status/1929307914050699560Despite the perceived lack of volatility, he remains confident in a year-end price of over $200,000. From the current level of $104,167, Bitcoin would need to rally approximately 91.99% to reach this target. If achieved, Bitcoin’s market capitalization would expand to around $3.97 trillion, assuming the circulating supply remains constant.Bitcoin Dad, who refers to himself as a Bitcoin millionaire, previously stated that price gains stem from “math, patience, and research.” On May 8, he reminded his followers that Bitcoin still trades below $1,000,000, reinforcing his belief that it remains early in the asset’s adoption cycle. When asked about a $450,000 EOY projection from another market commentator, he indicated he would acknowledge being wrong if that figure materializes.A Shared Target for Bitcoin PriceOther analysts also support this Bitcoin projection. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan has projected a $200,000 price by the end of 2025. On May 14, he outlined multiple drivers behind this view, including inflows into spot ETFs, growing corporate interest, and recent government initiatives. According to Hougan, ETFs acquired over 500,000 Bitcoin in the previous year, significantly outpacing the 165,000 new coins mined annually.Meanwhile, the U.S. government holds over $17 billion in Bitcoin. A recent executive directive now tasks the Secretaries of the Treasury and Commerce with sourcing more Bitcoin without using taxpayer funds. Reports also confirm that Abu Dhabi purchased $460 million worth of Bitcoin in the form of BlackRock's IBIT, and other governments are reportedly exploring similar allocations.Analysts Maintain Long-Term Bullish TargetsIn addition to Hougan and Bitcoin Dad, multiple market figures have issued parallel forecasts. Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani reiterated his firm's $200,000 Bitcoin projection by 2025. Elsewhere, Fred Krueger, a mathematician with a PhD from Stanford, posted on X that Bitcoin could reach a new all-time high within the week.

James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, disclosed the cryptocurrency investment funds' weekly flow in a blog post on Monday. The report shows that these vehicles, which offer exposure to digital assets, recorded a net inflow of $286 million in the previous week.The positive flow extends the streak of crypto investment products to seven weeks, with their last outflow in mid-April. Remarkably, the funds have accrued a total of $10.9 billion during this impressive run, bringing the year-to-date total to $11.13 billion.Ethereum Dethroned Bitcoin Last WeekTypically, investment vehicles that track the performance of Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, lead the proceedings weekly. However, Ethereum’s resilience in the face of market uncertainties and recent positive sentiments saw it emerge as the top performer last week. Specifically, Ethereum investment funds raked in $321 million in the week between May 26 and June 2, continuing their strong investor traction. The inflows took their weekly streak to six weeks, the best run since December 2024.Meanwhile, Ethereum funds have now recorded an MTD inflow of $889.5 million and a YTD of $1.4 billion. Generally, vehicles tracking the altcoin king now have a cumulative $14.3 billion in assets under management (AUM).Furthermore, Bitcoin’s streak ended last week, as funds tracking the asset saw mild outflows. The products had been on a six-week streak, bringing in $9.6 billion during the run, before last week's $8 million net outflow.Butterfill highlighted the funds’ strong start to the week, before a macroeconomic headwind from the New York court's declaration that the United States’ tariffs were illegal. Nonetheless, the asset maintains a healthy MTD inflow of $5.5 billion and $10.2 billion YTD.For XRP, its outflow streak extended to two consecutive weeks. XRP-based funds recorded a net outflow of $28 million, further suggesting caution among investors towards the asset, which had been on an 80-week inflow streak until two weeks ago.Other major flows saw Sui and Solana investment products draw in 2.2 million and $1.5 million, while users pulled $3.6 million and $2.4 million from Short Bitcoin and multi-asset funds, respectively. Inflows per Asset Inflows per Asset Remarkably, the net AUM across crypto investment funds reduced last week despite the $286 million inflow. For context, it dropped from its all-time high of $187 billion to $177 billion, as asset prices reduced within the week.Other Countries Step UpMeanwhile, according to regional flows, the United States, as is typical, led inflows, attracting $199 million. These numbers are meager compared to last week’s massive inflows, which were spurred by the performance of Bitcoin spot ETFs.Nonetheless, other countries showed serious momentum. For instance, Hong Kong's inflows improved from $3.3 million two weeks ago to $54.8 million the previous week, with Germany’s $42.9 million also surpassing the previous week's inflows.Australia recorded a net inflow of $21.5 million, while Switzerland, Sweden, and Brazil continued their poor run of form.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/02/bitcoin-stall-as-ethereum-leads-286m-weekly-crypto-investment-inflow/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-stall-as-ethereum-leads-286m-weekly-crypto-investment-inflow,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|XRP","Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today|Latest Ethereum (ETH) News Today|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today",cryptocompare

Violations can lead to ethics investigations and fines, though penalties are often minor, typically $200, and frequently waived by ethics officials. Violating the Stock Act Gill is among a growing list of lawmakers who have violated the STOCK Act.

Monero ( XMR ) climbed to $365, its highest point since May 28, and now sits 16% above its lowest level from last week. The rebound happened even as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other cryptocurrencies wavered. It happened as the demand for privacy coins like Horizen ( ZEN ) and Zcash ( ZEC ) jumped. On-chain data shows that Monero’s exchange outflows surged to $8.9 million last week—the largest jump this year. Exchange outflows typically indicate that investors are moving tokens into self-custody, a potentially bullish signal. Monero’s funding rate has remained positive since May 15, suggesting that traders expect future prices to be higher than the current spot price. A positive funding rate is often viewed as a bullish catalyst, as crypto.news reported . You might also like: Best XRP rivals to buy for the next crypto bull market Monero token has been in a strong bullish trend in the past few months after spending three years in a consolidation phase. This rebound happened after a US court ruled against the Treasury Department for sanctioning Tornado Cash, a crypto mixer. The department was then forced to remove sanctions earlier this year. XMR’s momentum further accelerated after hackers reportedly used the coin to move over $300 million in suspected stolen funds. Monero is considered ideal for illicit transactions due to its privacy-enhancing features, including ring signatures, stealth addresses, and ring confidential transactions. These technologies ensure transaction anonymity. For example, ring signatures obscure the sender by blending their signature with decoys, while stealth addresses generate a one-time address for each transaction, further masking recipient details. Monero price technical analysis XMR price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that XMR has been in a sustained bull run since February 2024, when it was trading at $100.90. The token remains above both the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages. It has rebounded to $366 from last week’s low of $312. The Relative Strength Index and the MACD have all pointed upwards. For the rally to continue, Monero must break above resistance at $420, its highest point this year. A successful move above this level would invalidate the double-top pattern, whose neckline sits at $312, and could signal a further rally toward $500. Conversely, a drop below the $312 support would invalidate the bullish outlook.

Since its beginning on April 1, the pre-launch phase has seen several price jumps, taking the HINU token’s value from an initial $0.00015000 to its current value. The project has raised $788,111 so far, is closing in on the $800,000 milestone, and remains on track to reach its stated goal of $1.2 million. Husky INU (HINU) Registers Jump The Husky Inu (HINU) token registered the latest price jump of its pre-launch phase, rising to $0.00017682. The next price jump will take the token’s price to $0.00017733. The price increase is part of Husky Inu’s pre-launch phase and allows the project to continue its fundraising effort as its official launch date draws closer. The pre-launch phase and HINU’s regular price increases allow the project to raise additional capital and fund ongoing development, research, platform improvements, marketing initiatives, and ecosystem expansion. How Does The Pre-Launch Phase Work? Husky Inu’s pre-launch phase rewards early supporters and adopters while maintaining transparent growth. The pre-launch phase will see the HINU token price increase every two days until it meets its fundraising goal or all the HINU tokens sell out. The starting price of the HINU token at the beginning of the pre-launch phase was $0.00015000.

2025-06-02T15:27:24,"Navigating the World of Cryptocurrency Trading: Tips and Platforms to Consider","Cryptocurrency has gone from being a fringe interest to a central player in financial markets. It’s no longer just a conversation topic for tech enthusiasts. Today, trading digital assets is something individual investors, institutions, and even governments are watching closely. Image But with the rapid rise of the crypto market comes a whole lot of noise. New platforms, new coins, constant volatility, and endless headlines. It can feel overwhelming, especially if you're just getting started. That’s why understanding the landscape and knowing what to look for in a trading platform is more important than ever. The Rise of Cryptocurrency Trading The early days of crypto were mostly about buying and holding. Bitcoin was the big name, and the idea of trading it like a traditional asset wasn’t mainstream. That changed fast. As more people realized the potential of digital currencies, a full-blown market emerged. Trading volumes exploded. New tokens hit the scene. And platforms began offering tools that looked a lot like those used in forex or stock trading. This shift marked the beginning of cryptocurrency trading as a serious, fast-paced, and highly speculative activity. Now, traders can go long or short, use leverage, access real-time charts, and manage portfolios all within the crypto ecosystem. More importantly, it's not just about Bitcoin anymore. Ethereum, Solana, and dozens of other coins are actively traded every day. Each one moves differently, driven by unique tech developments, partnerships, and global news. For traders, this variety means opportunity, but also the need for constant learning and awareness. What Makes Cryptocurrency Trading Unique? Trading crypto isn't quite like trading stocks or commodities. Yes, it still involves buying and selling, watching charts, and managing risk. But a few things make it stand apart: ● 24/7 market – Unlike traditional markets, crypto never sleeps. Prices move day and night, even on weekends and holidays.● High volatility – Price swings are common, sometimes sharp, and often driven by headlines, social media, or market sentiment.● Lack of central control – No central bank or government controls most cryptocurrencies. That decentralization is part of the appeal, but also adds uncertainty.● Security and storage – You’re not just thinking about price: you also need to consider how your assets are stored and protected. These factors create both risk and opportunity. For some traders, the fast pace and non-stop movement are what make crypto exciting. For others, the lack of predictability is a reason to stay cautious. Key Features to Look for in a Trading Platform With hundreds of platforms out there, picking the right one can be a challenge. But a good platform does more than let you buy and sell. It supports your strategy, keeps you informed, and helps protect your funds. Here are a few things to consider when choosing a crypto trading platform: ● User experience – Is the interface clean and easy to navigate? Can you find what you need without digging through menus?● Security measures – Look for strong encryption, two-factor authentication, and cold storage options.● Asset variety – A broader selection of coins can help you diversify and take advantage of more market opportunities.● Trading tools – Real-time charts, technical indicators, and order types like stop-loss or take-profit are essential for active traders.● Educational resources – Some platforms offer tutorials, market updates, and analysis, which are helpful for both beginners and experienced users.● Fees and spreads – Transparent pricing matters. Check what it costs to enter and exit trades, especially if you’re trading frequently. Not every platform will offer everything. It depends on your goals. Beginners might value simplicity and learning materials, while advanced traders may want deeper analysis tools and faster execution. Comparing Popular Platform Options Choosing the right platform can shape your entire trading experience. With so many available, it helps to understand how different types cater to specific needs and skill levels. Platforms for Beginners Beginner-focused platforms are typically built with simplicity at their core. They often feature uncluttered interfaces, clear buy and sell options, and minimal distractions. This allows new traders to focus on the basics without being overwhelmed by advanced tools they may not need just yet. In many cases, these platforms also include helpful resources like tutorials, quick guides, or FAQs to explain common terms and functions. Some even offer demo accounts where you can practice trading without using real money. For someone taking their first steps into cryptocurrency trading, this type of environment can make the learning curve far less intimidating. Platforms for Experienced Traders More advanced users usually want something that gives them greater control and insight. Platforms designed for experienced traders tend to offer more in-depth features, including real-time market data, customizable charting tools, and advanced order types like stop-limit or trailing stop orders. Speed and precision also matter here. These platforms typically focus on delivering fast execution and access to deeper liquidity, which can make a difference when working within narrow margins or reacting quickly to market changes. While the interface might be more complex, that complexity comes with added flexibility, which seasoned traders often value. All-in-One Multi-Market Platforms Some traders don’t just want access to crypto. They’re also looking to manage trades in forex, indices, or commodities from a single place. This is where multi-market platforms stand out. These platforms allow users to diversify their trading strategies without switching between services. Being able to monitor different asset classes side by side can help traders make more informed decisions, especially during periods of high market correlation or volatility. One platform that takes this approach is ThinkMarkets . It offers both cryptocurrency and traditional market access in one integrated environment. For traders who like the idea of managing everything in one account, from crypto positions to index trades, this type of setup brings added convenience and versatility. Staying Ahead with Market Trends Several factors can cause sudden price changes. Regulatory announcements are one of the biggest. If a government tightens or loosens its stance on crypto, the market reacts immediately. A single statement from a financial authority can cause major shifts, especially for larger coins. Blockchain upgrades are another key influence. For example, when a popular network like Ethereum undergoes a major update, traders and investors closely watch to see how it affects fees, transaction speed, and scalability. If the changes are positive, the price may rise. If they’re poorly received, it might do the opposite. Adoption news also plays a major role. When digital currencies are integrated into major payment platforms or used by well-known companies, confidence in the asset tends to grow. This usually pushes demand higher, especially among long-term holders. Even activity from large crypto holders, sometimes referred to as “whales,” can influence the market. When these big players move large amounts of coins in or out of wallets, traders take notice. It often signals that a big move is coming, and many people act accordingly. Stay Informed, Trade with Intention Successful traders pay attention to this type of information and learn to read between the lines. They understand that price action isn’t random. It’s the result of news, sentiment, and larger economic patterns. Having access to timely updates and solid market analysis can give traders the edge they need to respond quickly and make better decisions. The key to success isn’t finding shortcuts or guessing which coin will skyrocket next. It’s about staying informed, using the right tools, and approaching each trade with a clear purpose.
