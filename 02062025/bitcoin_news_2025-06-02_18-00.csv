2025-06-02T15:50:07,"Hacking Incidents Never End in the Crypto Industry! Here is the Latest Multi-Million Dollar Hack Incident!","Nervos Network’s cross-chain protocol Force Bridge has been hit by a decentralized finance (DeFi) attack, causing the loss of over $3 million in cryptocurrencies, according to analysis by Web3 security firm Cyvers. Nervos Network's Force Bridge Hacked: Over $3 Million in Crypto Stolen According to security researchers, the attackers seized approximately 257,800 USDT, 539.09 ETH (about $1.35 million), 898,300 USDC, 60,400 DAI, and 0.79 wrapped Bitcoin worth approximately $83,000. Most of the stolen assets were converted to Ethereum and transferred through the Tornado Cash mixer, which is often used to cover up the tracks. Following the attack, infrastructure company Magickbase, which makes significant contributions to the Nervos ecosystem, announced that it has stopped its bridge service and launched an investigation. The company made a statement on June 2 on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) stating, “Our team is investigating the incident.” Singapore-based Magickbase is known as one of the main partners providing infrastructure support to Nervos Network’s developers and users. The company recently announced plans to terminate its Force Bridge service as of May 31, citing low user activity and high maintenance costs. Nervos Network, whose mainnet was launched in 2019, aims to increase cross-chain interoperability and create an integrated blockchain ecosystem with tools such as Force Bridge. DeFi bridges like Force Bridge work with smart contracts and “token wrapping” technologies that allow for the transfer of assets and data between isolated blockchains, but these systems are frequently subject to hacker attacks due to their complex structures and security vulnerabilities. Notable past examples include the Ronin Bridge attack in 2022, where $600 million was stolen, and the Wormhole attack, where $323 million was stolen. Such incidents once again reveal how fragile DeFi bridges can be in terms of security. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Hacking Incidents Never End in the Crypto Industry!

According to the Congress trade filings, Gill purchased up to $850,000 worth of Bitcoin across six transactions, reported on May 30, 2025. Receive Signals on US Congress Members' Stock Trades Stocks Stay up-to-date on the trading activity of US Congress members. The signal triggers based on updates from the House disclosure reports, notifying you of their latest stock transactions. Enable signal The trades occurred on January 29, February 27, May 13, and May 18, with the earliest made more than 120 days before being reported, well past the 45-day deadline mandated by law. The STOCK Act requires lawmakers to disclose transactions over $1,000 within 45 days. Violations can lead to ethics investigations and fines, though penalties are often minor, typically $200, and frequently waived by ethics officials. Violating the Stock Act Gill is among a growing list of lawmakers who have violated the STOCK Act. In many cases, members of Congress have blamed delays on ignorance, clerical mistakes, or errors by accountants. Interestingly, such violations only attract standard fines of just $200. In addition to Bitcoin, Gill reported trades in the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) and Treasury-only government securities (TOIXX), both filed on the same day. Gill’s sizable exposure to digital assets comes as the U.S. moves toward clearer cryptocurrency regulation following President Donald Trump’s return to office. Notably, Gill’s purchases coincided with Bitcoin trading above $100,000; the asset is priced at $104,141, down 0.5% on the day and 3% over the past week. Bitcoin one-week price chart.

2025-06-02T15:38:43,"Monero price eyes $500, but $420 stands as the next key hurdle","Monero price rose for three consecutive days as investors bought the dip following last week’s crash. Monero ( XMR ) climbed to $365, its highest point since May 28, and now sits 16% above its lowest level from last week. The rebound happened even as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other cryptocurrencies wavered. It happened as the demand for privacy coins like Horizen ( ZEN ) and Zcash ( ZEC ) jumped. On-chain data shows that Monero’s exchange outflows surged to $8.9 million last week—the largest jump this year. Exchange outflows typically indicate that investors are moving tokens into self-custody, a potentially bullish signal. Monero’s funding rate has remained positive since May 15, suggesting that traders expect future prices to be higher than the current spot price. A positive funding rate is often viewed as a bullish catalyst, as crypto.news reported . You might also like: Best XRP rivals to buy for the next crypto bull market Monero token has been in a strong bullish trend in the past few months after spending three years in a consolidation phase. This rebound happened after a US court ruled against the Treasury Department for sanctioning Tornado Cash, a crypto mixer. The department was then forced to remove sanctions earlier this year. XMR’s momentum further accelerated after hackers reportedly used the coin to move over $300 million in suspected stolen funds. Monero is considered ideal for illicit transactions due to its privacy-enhancing features, including ring signatures, stealth addresses, and ring confidential transactions. These technologies ensure transaction anonymity. For example, ring signatures obscure the sender by blending their signature with decoys, while stealth addresses generate a one-time address for each transaction, further masking recipient details. Monero price technical analysis XMR price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that XMR has been in a sustained bull run since February 2024, when it was trading at $100.90. The token remains above both the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages. It has rebounded to $366 from last week’s low of $312. The Relative Strength Index and the MACD have all pointed upwards. For the rally to continue, Monero must break above resistance at $420, its highest point this year. A successful move above this level would invalidate the double-top pattern, whose neckline sits at $312, and could signal a further rally toward $500. Conversely, a drop below the $312 support would invalidate the bullish outlook.

BTCS Inc., a Nasdaq-listed blockchain company betting big on Ethereum ( ETH ), added another 1,000 ETH to its holdings through the cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com . The purchase brings the company’s total ETH balance to 13,500.

This expansion goes beyond a simple bet on the top altcoin by market cap—it reflects BTCS Inc.’s long-term strategy to deliver shareholder value through digital asset exposure and blockchain infrastructure development. Charles Allen, CEO of BTCS, noted that by focusing on revenue-generating infrastructure via NodeOps and increased builder activity, the company is deploying a growth-oriented model. “This complementary approach not only delivers the benefits of a digital asset treasury strategy but also unlocks long-term growth potential that goes far beyond mere price appreciation.

2025-06-02T15:27:24,"Navigating the World of Cryptocurrency Trading: Tips and Platforms to Consider","Cryptocurrency has gone from being a fringe interest to a central player in financial markets. It’s no longer just a conversation topic for tech enthusiasts. Today, trading digital assets is something individual investors, institutions, and even governments are watching closely. Image But with the rapid rise of the crypto market comes a whole lot of noise. New platforms, new coins, constant volatility, and endless headlines. It can feel overwhelming, especially if you're just getting started. That’s why understanding the landscape and knowing what to look for in a trading platform is more important than ever. The Rise of Cryptocurrency Trading The early days of crypto were mostly about buying and holding. Bitcoin was the big name, and the idea of trading it like a traditional asset wasn’t mainstream. That changed fast. As more people realized the potential of digital currencies, a full-blown market emerged. Trading volumes exploded. New tokens hit the scene. And platforms began offering tools that looked a lot like those used in forex or stock trading. This shift marked the beginning of cryptocurrency trading as a serious, fast-paced, and highly speculative activity. Now, traders can go long or short, use leverage, access real-time charts, and manage portfolios all within the crypto ecosystem. More importantly, it's not just about Bitcoin anymore. Ethereum, Solana, and dozens of other coins are actively traded every day. Each one moves differently, driven by unique tech developments, partnerships, and global news. For traders, this variety means opportunity, but also the need for constant learning and awareness. What Makes Cryptocurrency Trading Unique? Trading crypto isn't quite like trading stocks or commodities. Yes, it still involves buying and selling, watching charts, and managing risk. But a few things make it stand apart: ● 24/7 market – Unlike traditional markets, crypto never sleeps. Prices move day and night, even on weekends and holidays.● High volatility – Price swings are common, sometimes sharp, and often driven by headlines, social media, or market sentiment.● Lack of central control – No central bank or government controls most cryptocurrencies. That decentralization is part of the appeal, but also adds uncertainty.● Security and storage – You’re not just thinking about price: you also need to consider how your assets are stored and protected. These factors create both risk and opportunity. For some traders, the fast pace and non-stop movement are what make crypto exciting. For others, the lack of predictability is a reason to stay cautious. Key Features to Look for in a Trading Platform With hundreds of platforms out there, picking the right one can be a challenge. But a good platform does more than let you buy and sell. It supports your strategy, keeps you informed, and helps protect your funds. Here are a few things to consider when choosing a crypto trading platform: ● User experience – Is the interface clean and easy to navigate? Can you find what you need without digging through menus?● Security measures – Look for strong encryption, two-factor authentication, and cold storage options.● Asset variety – A broader selection of coins can help you diversify and take advantage of more market opportunities.● Trading tools – Real-time charts, technical indicators, and order types like stop-loss or take-profit are essential for active traders.● Educational resources – Some platforms offer tutorials, market updates, and analysis, which are helpful for both beginners and experienced users.● Fees and spreads – Transparent pricing matters. Check what it costs to enter and exit trades, especially if you’re trading frequently. Not every platform will offer everything. It depends on your goals. Beginners might value simplicity and learning materials, while advanced traders may want deeper analysis tools and faster execution. Comparing Popular Platform Options Choosing the right platform can shape your entire trading experience. With so many available, it helps to understand how different types cater to specific needs and skill levels. Platforms for Beginners Beginner-focused platforms are typically built with simplicity at their core. They often feature uncluttered interfaces, clear buy and sell options, and minimal distractions. This allows new traders to focus on the basics without being overwhelmed by advanced tools they may not need just yet. In many cases, these platforms also include helpful resources like tutorials, quick guides, or FAQs to explain common terms and functions. Some even offer demo accounts where you can practice trading without using real money. For someone taking their first steps into cryptocurrency trading, this type of environment can make the learning curve far less intimidating. Platforms for Experienced Traders More advanced users usually want something that gives them greater control and insight. Platforms designed for experienced traders tend to offer more in-depth features, including real-time market data, customizable charting tools, and advanced order types like stop-limit or trailing stop orders. Speed and precision also matter here. These platforms typically focus on delivering fast execution and access to deeper liquidity, which can make a difference when working within narrow margins or reacting quickly to market changes. While the interface might be more complex, that complexity comes with added flexibility, which seasoned traders often value. All-in-One Multi-Market Platforms Some traders don’t just want access to crypto. They’re also looking to manage trades in forex, indices, or commodities from a single place. This is where multi-market platforms stand out. These platforms allow users to diversify their trading strategies without switching between services. Being able to monitor different asset classes side by side can help traders make more informed decisions, especially during periods of high market correlation or volatility. One platform that takes this approach is ThinkMarkets . It offers both cryptocurrency and traditional market access in one integrated environment. For traders who like the idea of managing everything in one account, from crypto positions to index trades, this type of setup brings added convenience and versatility. Staying Ahead with Market Trends Several factors can cause sudden price changes. Regulatory announcements are one of the biggest. If a government tightens or loosens its stance on crypto, the market reacts immediately. A single statement from a financial authority can cause major shifts, especially for larger coins. Blockchain upgrades are another key influence. For example, when a popular network like Ethereum undergoes a major update, traders and investors closely watch to see how it affects fees, transaction speed, and scalability. If the changes are positive, the price may rise. If they’re poorly received, it might do the opposite. Adoption news also plays a major role. When digital currencies are integrated into major payment platforms or used by well-known companies, confidence in the asset tends to grow. This usually pushes demand higher, especially among long-term holders. Even activity from large crypto holders, sometimes referred to as “whales,” can influence the market. When these big players move large amounts of coins in or out of wallets, traders take notice. It often signals that a big move is coming, and many people act accordingly. Stay Informed, Trade with Intention Successful traders pay attention to this type of information and learn to read between the lines. They understand that price action isn’t random. It’s the result of news, sentiment, and larger economic patterns. Having access to timely updates and solid market analysis can give traders the edge they need to respond quickly and make better decisions. The key to success isn’t finding shortcuts or guessing which coin will skyrocket next. It’s about staying informed, using the right tools, and approaching each trade with a clear purpose.

2025-06-02T15:21:23,"Czech Minister Steps Down, Opposition Calls for Govt to Resign Over $46M in BTC ‘Donated’ from Convicted Criminal","The Czech Republic has been shaken by a Bitcoin scandal. On Friday, Justice Minister Pavel Blažek resigned, with the opposition set to demand the resignation of the coalition government this week as well. The situation caught on fire at the end of last week after Blažek, a conservative politician, accepted a large donation in BTC and sold it for about $45.8 million in March, the AP reported . The opposition has raised concerns over the source of the donation . Blažek received the coins from Tomas Jirikovsky, a convicted criminal. Jirikovsky operated the Sheep Marketplace . In 2017, he went to prison for embezzlement, drug trafficking, and illegal trading of weapons. Jirikovsky’s lawyer reportedly approached Blažek in March 2025, saying his client would donate 30% of his BTC stash to the ministry. Police had confiscated the wallet containing this BTC and returned it to Jirikovsky after his release in 2021. Poslední veřejná dražba se uskutečnila včera 27. května, celkem bylo úspěšně realizováno 78 elektronických aukcí a do majetku státu směřuje 956,8 mil. Kč.

Jirikovsky probably wanted “to repent” through the donation, he said. He also claimed that courts had not proven that the BTC came from criminal activity. However, the opposition parties argue that it’s unclear why Jirikovsky gave the coins to the ministry or where the coins came from. They accused Blažek of potential money laundering. Furthermore, they argue that the state shouldn’t use the money until these points are clear. Meanwhile, the High Prosecutor’s Office in Olomouc is investigating the case on suspicion of abuse of official authority and laundering of proceeds of crime. Blažek denied knowledge of wrongdoing. Nonetheless, he said he resigned so not to harm the four-party coalition government led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala. The PM said he believed that Blažek acted with goodwill.

The transaction, flagged by blockchain analysts and tracked by platforms such as Lookonchain and Arkham Intelligence, has sparked a wave of speculation across the crypto community.The funds appear to have passed through Jambler, a centralized Bitcoin mixing service, rather than more widely used decentralized privacy tools like Wasabi or Samourai.... Czech Coalition Government in Danger? Today, Brno Daily reported that the lower house will hold an urgent session on Thursday. The opposition parties will use the occasion to demand the resignation of the coalition government, the deputy leaders of the ANO and SPD parties, Karel Havlicek and Radim Fiala, said on Sunday. “We will want the government to find sufficient self-reflection and resign,” Havlicek said. The current cabinet could stay until the parliamentary elections in October, but it shouldn’t have the power to make major decisions. If the coalition government doesn’t resign, “We are very strongly considering calling a no-confidence vote in the government.” Fiala, deputy leader of the far-right SPD, said that his party “will support an extraordinary session” and a vote of no confidence in the government. However, lower house speaker Jan Skopecek said the opposition’s plans are just “theatre” in the campaign ahead of the elections. He added that Blažek has already resigned, so there is no reason for the cabinet to do so as well. Moreover, Czech Fiscal Council chair Mojmir Hampl argued that this case raises numerous key technical questions. However, these will not be answered in the pre-election stage. Meanwhile, Le Monde reported that Jirikovsky had been trying to recover about 1,500 BTC, seized by the police, since his imprisonment. During the trial, the court suspected that the coins came from Nucleus . This is a dark web marketplace that, the report claims, shut down the day after Jirikovsky’s arrest. Source: Arkham Furthermore, BTC market monitors noted that a portion of the Nucleus-linked BTC , dormant since 2016, moved to new wallets in March. This is after Blažek signed the agreement, reports claim. Jirikovsky claimed that he got to keep the BTC because he had obtained it legally. Blažek claimed he hadn’t made any promises in return for the donation. All these allegations will likely be brought up during the Thursday emergency session.

Today, that scarcity has become one of the key reasons it holds value. For years, people have looked back and said, “I wish I had bought when it was still early.” But as the market gears up for what could be the most unpredictable cycle yet, a new name is emerging with eerily similar fundamentals—Bitcoin Solaris. If you missed the ride with Bitcoin, the next best opportunity might just be staring you in the face. Built for a mobile-first world and architected with next-gen consensus mechanics, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) doesn’t just follow in Bitcoin’s footsteps—it upgrades them for the modern age. Live Coin Watch Signals a Shift—Bitcoin Solaris Grabs Attention Live Coin Watch has become a go-to hub for spotting trends before they explode. Over the past few weeks, one name has been steadily climbing watchlists, gathering traction in user alerts and gaining chatter across social feeds—Bitcoin Solaris. With its fixed 21 million token supply echoing the fundamentals that made Bitcoin iconic, it’s no surprise analysts are eyeing it as a potential sleeper giant. Unlike most coins that pop up and fade, BTC-S combines Bitcoin’s trusted scarcity model with modern tools built for mass adoption—mobile mining, blazing speeds, and a fully decentralized ecosystem. For many watchers, this isn’t just another listing—it’s a sign of what could become the next major wealth-building movement in crypto. Meet Bitcoin Solaris: Built to Outrun the Past Bitcoin Solaris is a high-speed , energy-efficient blockchain platform with one mission—unlock wealth-building tools for everyday users. Its architecture isn’t just theoretical brilliance—it’s performance you can see, feel, and mine. Dual-layer architecture: Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Contribution (PoC) at the base, with an Application Layer powered by Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Time (PoT). Speed you can use: 10,000+ transactions per second and 2-second finality. Energy efficiency: Over 99.95% lower consumption than Bitcoin’s mining model. Through the exciting release of the upcoming Solaris Nova App, users will be able to mine directly from their phones , laptops, or desktops—removing the technical barrier that’s locked millions out of mining entirely. Why This Presale Feels Like 2011 All Over Again The buzz isn’t accidental. Bitcoin Solaris is now in Phase 6 of its presale: Current Price: $6 Next Phase: $7 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 10% With less than 8 weeks left, over 11,000 investors have already joined. $1.8M+ has been raised. This is being called the shortest presale in crypto history, and for good reason. From just $6 to $20, the projected 1,900% ROI isn’t clickbait—it’s math. Crypto Mining Just Got Simpler, Smarter, and Mobile—Join BTC-S A Supply Model That Mimics Bitcoin—And Improves It Bitcoin Solaris follows a well-structured tokenomics model designed to reflect Bitcoin’s scarcity while introducing modern, utility-driven distribution. With a fixed supply of 21 million BTC-S tokens, the allocation supports long-term sustainability, fair access, and community growth: 66.66% allocated for mining (distributed over 90 years) 20% reserved for the presale 5% for liquidity pools 2% for ecosystem development 2% for community rewards 2% for staking rewards 2% for marketing 0.33% allocated to team and advisors It’s not just about scarcity—it’s about where the tokens go. And in BTC-S’s case, they go where they matter most: to users, miners, and builders. What the Community is Saying Crypto influencers and enthusiasts are buzzing over Bitcoin Solaris. Here’s what they’re saying: Crypto Legends : Called it “the next evolution of bitcoin in 2025.” Crypto Royal : Highlighted the energy efficiency and user-first mining design. Token Empire : Emphasized the cross-chain functionality and presale momentum. Token Galaxy : Focused on the growing referral-powered community traction.

Conclusion Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just a new project—it’s a second chance. A do-over for those who missed Bitcoin’s quiet beginnings.

2025-06-02T15:00:37,"Here’s What The Ripple CEO Had To Say About The Bitcoin Vs. XRP Debate","Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has stressed that members of the Bitcoin community are not enemies of XRP holders. His latest remarks come amid increased discussions , especially on social media, about the relationship between the two large blockchain ecosystems. Speaking at an event in Las Vegas, Garlinghouse argued that Bitcoin and XRP are not competing in a zero-sum game, but rather advancing a shared mission that could reshape the global banking system over the next decade. Garlinghouse Says Bitcoin And XRP Can Both Win Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse directly addressed the perceived rivalry between the two communities while speaking at a recent event in Las Vegas. “The Bitcoin community is not our enemy. They really are not. If they do well, we’re gonna do well, we might do better. It’s not a zero-sum game,” he told attendees . His comments demonstrate Ripple’s leadership in positioning XRP not as a challenger to Bitcoin, but as a strong force driving forward a digital transformation. Rather than causing division, Garlinghouse’s comments advocate for mutual progress, arguing that growth in the Bitcoin ecosystem is not a threat to Ripple’s success. Although price comparisons have dominated much of the debate, Garlinghouse’s remarks draw attention to a bigger split in their vision. As the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin was created to challenge the traditional global finance system. On the other hand, Ripple’s XRP focuses on working within regulatory frameworks to improve cross-border payments among banks. Despite their differences, Garlinghouse suggested both are necessary players in a much larger transformation of the baking industry. A Shared Role In Rebuilding Global Finance Garlinghouse didn’t stop at defending XRP’s relationship with Bitcoin; he expanded his vision to the future of the banking system itself. “Rewriting the entire banking system and what this looks like in maybe 10 years or 20 years. We underestimate how big that change is and how profound it is, and we get there by being collaborative and working together and not against each other,” he added. His comments serve as a call for unity as digital assets become increasingly integrated into the global financial system. As such, the message to XRP holders is clear. XRP’s Success doesn’t require discrediting or working against Bitcoin. Both assets can rise together if the focus is on adoption and the greater mission in global finance. One such adoption is the recent official launch of both XRP and Micro XRP futures contracts on CME Group. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse took to the social media platform X to mark this move, describing it as a key institutional milestone for XRP. Furthermore, investor optimism for a spot XRP ETF has increased significantly in recent weeks, with the odds of approval by the SEC now sitting at 83%. Meanwhile, XRP is currently trading at $2.16 after rebounding from $2.10 on May 31.

2025-06-02T14:54:42,"Today, 13 Years Ago, Arthur Britto Committed This Code that Created the 100 Billion XRP","On this day, thirteen years ago, a pivotal moment in the history of cryptocurrency unfolded, one that would set the stage for what is now one of the most prominent digital assets in the world. As highlighted by respected XRP Ledger validator, Vet, in a recent post on X, June 2 marks the anniversary of when Arthur Britto, one of the key architects behind the Ripple project, committed the code that officially created the supply of 100 billion XRP. This was not just a technical milestone; it was the foundational moment that birthed an entire ecosystem aimed at revolutionizing global payments. Happy Birthday XRP! Today, 13 years ago, Arthur Britto committed this code that created the 100b XRP. https://t.co/Ku748uUAhE — Vet (@Vet_X0) June 2, 2025 The Birth of XRP and Ripple’s Vision Arthur Britto, alongside David Schwartz and Jed McCaleb, envisioned a blockchain-based digital asset that could address the inefficiencies plaguing traditional financial systems. While Bitcoin had emerged a few years earlier as a decentralized peer-to-peer electronic cash system, the Ripple founders saw an opportunity to tackle a different problem: cross-border payments. Existing systems like SWIFT were slow, expensive, and fragmented. The idea behind XRP was to create a digital asset that could act as a universal bridge currency, enabling instant, low-cost transfers across currencies, banks, and borders. The creation of the 100 billion XRP supply, fixed, finite, and pre-mined, was a deliberate design choice. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, where new coins are introduced through mining or staking, all XRP came into existence at once. This approach was intended to ensure predictability, efficiency, and scalability, allowing Ripple to distribute XRP strategically to support network growth and adoption. While this pre-mining model has drawn criticism over the years, particularly from those who advocate for proof-of-work systems, it has also enabled Ripple to forge partnerships with major financial institutions and central banks. Arthur Britto: The Quiet Architect Although much of the public attention has centered on Ripple’s executive chairman, Chris Larsen, and CTO David Schwartz , Arthur Britto’s role has been equally foundational. Britto, known for his intensely private nature, was instrumental in the early protocol design and in envisioning XRP’s scalability for global use. His early contributions, including the fateful code commit 13 years ago, laid the groundwork for Ripple’s goal of building an “Internet of Value”, a world where money moves as seamlessly as information does today. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Britto’s influence extends beyond the original codebase. He remains a key figure behind the scenes, particularly through his work at PolySign, a company focused on institutional-grade digital asset custody. His technical foresight continues to shape the evolution of digital finance, even if he chooses to stay largely out of the limelight. XRP’s Journey: Triumphs, Challenges, and Resilience Since its creation, XRP has weathered dramatic highs and lows. It became one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, achieving major exchange listings and becoming a pillar of RippleNet, Ripple’s enterprise blockchain payment platform. At its peak, XRP’s price soared to over $3 in early 2018, making early adopters and supporters hopeful of an even greater breakthrough. Yet the journey has not been without challenges. Regulatory scrutiny, particularly from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has cast a long shadow over Ripple and XRP . Despite these legal hurdles, XRP has maintained a loyal global community and continues to see active development, with Ripple expanding its services, including in central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiatives, cross-border remittances, and tokenization projects. The Legacy of a Code Commit What makes Vet’s reminder so powerful is not just the nostalgia of looking back but the realization of how one code commit can shape an entire technological and financial movement. On June 2, 2012, when Arthur Britto formalized the creation of the XRP supply, he wasn’t just writing code; he was setting in motion a vision of financial interoperability that still inspires innovation today. As Ripple continues to push forward, whether through legal victories, technological advancements, or new partnerships, the foundational act that took place thirteen years ago remains central. It is a testament to the power of vision, code, and collaboration, and to the enduring ambition of building a financial system fit for the digital age. Happy Birthday, XRP.

2025-06-02T14:50:05,"Bitcoin Price Stalls: Why Strategic Positioning is Crucial Now","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Stalls: Why Strategic Positioning is Crucial Now If you’ve been watching the charts, you’ve probably noticed something about the Bitcoin price lately – it feels a bit stuck. After a period of excitement, the momentum seems to have stalled, leaving many wondering what’s next. This is a key moment where understanding the market structure becomes vital for crypto investors looking to navigate these choppy waters effectively. What Does a Stalled Bitcoin Price Mean? Recent observations from crypto data analytics firm Swissblock, shared on social media, highlight this exact scenario. They pointed out that Bitcoin’s structure has shifted. This change occurred after what they described as a failed breakout attempt towards the significant $110,000–$111,000 level. While this level might seem far off from current prices, the inability of the market to sustain momentum even *towards* such ambitious targets signals a lack of immediate bullish conviction. Instead of pushing higher, BTC has retreated and is now consolidating within a lower price range. This range-bound action is characterized by: Defined Boundaries: Price tends to bounce between clear support and resistance levels. Reduced Volatility (Often): Compared to trending markets, price swings within the range can be less dramatic, though sudden spikes or drops are always possible. Trader Frustration: Failed breakouts in either direction can trap traders and lead to sideways chop. This period contrasts sharply with the impulsive moves seen during strong uptrends or downtrends. It suggests a phase of indecision or accumulation/distribution among market participants. Why is Market Positioning More Important Than Chasing Now? Swissblock’s analysis emphasizes that the current environment is less about ‘chasing’ pumps or dumps and more about ‘positioning’. What exactly does this mean for your BTC trading strategy ? Think of it like this: Chasing Positioning Buying aggressively as price rises, fearing missing out (FOMO). Strategically buying or selling at key support/resistance levels within the range. Selling in panic as price drops sharply. Setting limit orders at desired entry/exit points. Reacting emotionally to short-term price swings. Planning trades based on technical analysis and market structure. Higher risk of buying the top or selling the bottom of a short-term move. Focusing on accumulating or distributing positions patiently. In a range-bound market, chasing breakouts often leads to getting trapped in false moves. The smart money isn’t blindly buying every small uptick; they are likely building positions at favorable prices within the established range, anticipating the eventual larger move. What Does a Market Cleanout Involve and Why Might it Be Necessary? Swissblock expects the next major move to come only after a ‘market cleanout’. This term might sound dramatic, but it’s a common concept in volatile markets like crypto. A market cleanout typically involves: Increased Volatility: A sharp, often sudden price swing (up or down) that breaks the current pattern. Liquidation Cascades: Leveraged positions that are stopped out, forcing more buying or selling and accelerating the price move. Shaking Out Weak Hands: Inexperienced or overly leveraged traders are forced out of their positions due to margin calls or stop losses being hit. Testing Key Levels: Price often aggressively tests significant support or resistance levels, sometimes even temporarily breaking them before reversing. Why is this ‘cleanout’ necessary before a major move? Consolidation periods allow leverage to build up in the system. A sharp move is needed to ‘reset’ this leverage by liquidating positions on one side of the market. This creates the necessary fuel (orders) for the price to then move more freely and decisively in the opposite direction, initiating the next trend phase. How Can Crypto Investors Strategically Position Themselves Now? Given this analysis, patience and strategic thinking are paramount for crypto investors . Here are some actionable insights: Identify the Range: Clearly define the current support and resistance levels where Bitcoin is trading. These become your potential entry and exit points. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the exact bottom of the range, systematically invest a fixed amount at regular intervals. This averages out your purchase price. Set Limit Orders: Place buy orders at or near the identified support level and sell orders at or near the resistance level. This automates your positioning and removes emotion. Manage Risk: Use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses if the price breaks decisively out of the range against your position. Don’t over-leverage. Focus on the Long Term: If you’re a long-term holder, short-term range-bound action can be seen as an opportunity to accumulate at potentially favorable prices. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on broader crypto market analysis and macroeconomic factors that could trigger the next major move or cleanout. This isn’t a time for impulsive decisions. It’s a time for calculated moves, much like a chess player positioning their pieces before a major attack. What Does Broader Crypto Market Analysis Suggest? While Bitcoin often leads the way, its current state influences the entire market. Altcoins may also consolidate or show muted performance while BTC is range-bound. A cleanout in Bitcoin could lead to significant volatility across the board. Understanding the macro landscape is also crucial: Economic Indicators: Inflation data, interest rate decisions, and recession fears can all impact investor sentiment and capital flows into risk assets like crypto. Regulatory News: Developments regarding crypto regulation in major economies can create uncertainty or provide clarity. Network Fundamentals: On-chain data, mining difficulty, and development updates provide insights into the health and growth of the Bitcoin network itself. Integrating these factors into your crypto market analysis provides a more complete picture beyond just the price chart. Conclusion: Patience is Your Greatest Asset The message from analysts like Swissblock is clear: Bitcoin is in a consolidation phase, and the path forward likely involves a volatility-inducing ‘cleanout’ before a new trend emerges. For crypto investors , this isn’t a time for impatient chasing but for disciplined market positioning . By identifying the range, managing risk, and employing a thoughtful BTC trading strategy , you can prepare for the next significant move rather than being caught off guard by it. Patience, combined with strategic planning, remains one of the most valuable assets in the unpredictable world of cryptocurrency.

2025-06-02T14:45:24,"Can U.S. Buy More Bitcoin? Here’s What David Sacks Revealed","The post Can U.S. Buy More Bitcoin? Here’s What David Sacks Revealed appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News On May 27, 2025, US President’s crypto czar, David Sacks, says there is a pathway to acquire more bitcoin for the U.S. strategic reserve . This move follows Donald Trump’s executive order signed in March 2025, establishing the reserve as a new pillar for US digital asset policy. US Crypto-Focused Executive Action During a fireside chat with Gemini co-founders, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Sacks stated that federal purchase of bitcoin is not guaranteed. “ I can’t promise anything ,” Sacks said, “ but there is a pathway to doing that… if they can figure out how to fund it, they actually do have presidential authorization ready.” However, it might make some progress if done in the best manner. The executive order drawn in March was created with 200,000 Bitcoin ($22 million), which the government forfeited from civil and criminal assets. Sacks referenced using surplus money from other government programs to fund such acquisitions. In addition, he said, if the US can convince Howard Lutnik and Scott Bressent to buy some, then there will be no additional taxes on cryptocurrency. Crypto Agenda – With this plan, President Trump believes that the US could acquire its crypto agenda by August. Besides the Strategic plan for Bitcoin, David Sacks outlines other policies for crypto in the US. Sacks also expects the Genius Act Stablecoins bill to pass, and the market structure bill is likely before August. These policies aim to reform the crypto space in the US and prevent future regulatory backsliding. The Budget-Neutral Plan Sacks explained that the federal government is allowed to acquire bitcoin but only in budget budget-neutral way. If it can be done in a budget-neutral way, specifically, if either the Commerce Department or the Treasury Department can figure out how to fund it without adding to the debt, then they are allowed to create those programs,” Sacks stated. It states that the government can only acquire more bitcoin if it increases the national debt or requires new taxes. The cabinet officials are tasked with developing strategies to fund such acquisitions. This includes reallocating unused funds from the existing federal government.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/can-u-s-buy-more-bitcoin-heres-what-david-sacks-revealed/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-06-02T14:42:11,"Ripple Price at Pivotal Juncture: Dump Below $2 or Surge to $4.5 Next for XRP?","TL;DR Ripple’s cross-border token has struggled in the past week, alongside most of the market, and has dropped below a crucial support line, which has now turned into resistance. Analysts outlined a couple of different scenarios for the asset, which envision a price drop below $2 or a surge to $4.5. Is XRP Actually Heading for New ATH? The fourth-largest cryptocurrency surged in mid-May as the rest of the market recovered from the Trump-induced crash in early April. However, it couldn’t rise any higher than $2.6, where it was halted on a couple of occasions, while BTC managed to break through and chart a new all-time high of almost $112,000. Ethereum also outperformed XRP on a monthly scale, as the latter’s price seems stuck . Moreover, the asset fell below $2.3 in the past few days, a level that many analysts highlighted as a crucial support, now turned into a key resistance. Cryptowzrd noted that XRP closed indecisively the week, but pointed out the $2.21 resistance as the first obstacle in the asset’s long road to recovery. However, if it manages to reclaim it, this could form an inverse head-and-shoulders, which could result in offering a “long opportunity.” CW believes XRP’s turn “has come,” and suggested that the asset is expected to break through the current small convergence. If this pattern plays out, XRP’s next price target can be $4.5, which would mean a massive surge past the January 2018 all-time high of around $3.4. $XRP ‘s turn has come. It briefly broken the upper line of the convergence in the short-term correction, but the price recovered rapidly. And the uptrend that signals the end of the retest is imminent. This time, it is expected to break through that small convergence. The… pic.twitter.com/hVIpU4xueP — CW (@CW8900) May 31, 2025 The Bearish Scenario While the aforementioned scenarios provide a more optimistic outlook for XRP’s future price movements, Brett wasn’t so bullish. The analyst told their over 90,000 followers on X that Ripple’s token is currently at a “critical breakdown point.” It has dropped below key EMAs and is currently testing the 200 EMA. If it fails to remain above it, XRP could be on its way to the $2 support or even lower. They urged the bulls to “step in now,” or there will be more pain ahead for XRP. $XRP is at a critical breakdown point! Price has slipped below key EMAs and is now testing the 200 EMA.

On May 25, 2025, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb announced the bold strategy, stating, “This strategic allocation marks a pivotal moment in Pakistan’s digital transformation journey, unlocking economic potential by turning excess energy into innovation, investment, and international revenue.” Here’s why Pakistan is taking this high-voltage leap into the digital future: Driving Digital Growth Through Surplus Power Pakistan has experienced an electricity surplus due to heavy investment in power infrastructure and reduced industrial activity. Instead of wasting this power, the government plans to repurpose it for Bitcoin mining operations and AI data centers, enabling economic returns from otherwise idle resources. Attracting Investment and Revenue By legalizing and promoting Bitcoin mining, Pakistan aims to: Attract foreign and local investors Generate new streams of tax revenue Earn foreign exchange reserves Position itself as a sovereign digital economy in the global crypto space With crypto assets and AI technologies booming worldwide, this move could help Pakistan ride the next big digital wave. Building Tech Infrastructure and Jobs This initiative is not just about mining Bitcoin—it’s about building a digital ecosystem. By powering AI infrastructure: Pakistan boosts its domestic AI capabilities Creates high-skilled job opportunities for youth Encourages growth in fields like blockchain, data science, and cloud computing It’s a strategic approach to tackle unemployment and prepare the workforce for the future of tech. Clear Regulations, Real Impact Bilal Bin Saqib, Head of Crypto Council, called the move a “turning point” for Pakistan’s economy. He emphasized the need for transparent regulations and proper systems to fully unlock the potential of this transition. “With clear guidelines and secure systems, Pakistan can be a major player in the global crypto economy.” Joining Asia’s Crypto-Forward League Pakistan is now following in the footsteps of Kazakhstan, Japan, Malaysia, and Bhutan, all of which have embraced legal Bitcoin mining to fuel their economies. These countries have already cracked down on illicit mining and established regulated environments for digital growth. Final Take As Bitcoin prices continue to surge and AI becomes a cornerstone of global tech, Pakistan’s 2,000MW commitment signals a forward-thinking strategy. It’s not just an energy allocation—it’s a vision for a modern, digital, and self-reliant Pakistan.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/pakistan-allocates-2000mw-for-bitcoin-mining-and-ai-a-digital-revolution/,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare

2025-06-02T14:38:30,"Russian brokers and banks line up to launch crypto derivatives","Financial institutions in Russia, from brokers and banks to stock exchanges, are announcing a number of offerings of crypto derivatives following the central bank’s decision to legalize the latter. Some of the most prominent players in the country’s finance industry are entering the race to provide investors with a choice of options to put money into instruments, the yields of which are tied to the prices of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Finam offers crypto derivatives to Russian investors One by one, financial firms in Russia are lining up to tap into a promising market set to emerge after the country’s monetary authority permitted the offering of a new class of products – derivatives linked to decentralized digital assets. Finam, a well-established Russian broker since the early ‘90s, has joined the race. The company said it’s going to put out derivatives on leading cryptocurrencies, portfolios of several currencies, and products providing exposure to active algorithmic strategies. The most popular cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Solana (SOL), and others, will serve as base assets of Finam’s derivatives, the business daily Vedomosti reported on Sunday, quoting a representative of the investment firm. The products will be offered only to “ highly qualified investors ,” as per the Bank of Russia’s circular from May 28. To be accepted as such, private individuals would have to prove investments in securities or deposits exceeding 100 million rubles ($1.25 million) and 50 million rubles in annual income, the regulator suggested earlier this year. The instruments will help investors profit from both growing and declining crypto prices. Finam will develop tools allowing to obtain inverse profitability, an analogue of “shorts,” a representative of the brokerage explained. It plans to launch four different crypto products, the business news portal RBC reported. Sberbank issues structured bonds on Bitcoin Russia’s banking and financial giant Sberbank (Sber) has already issued structured bonds, the yield of which is tied to the value of Bitcoin, Vedomosti noted in another article. Holders will be able to benefit from both the changing prices of the leading cryptocurrency in U.S. dollars and the potential strengthening of the American fiat against the Russian ruble. Transactions with the bonds are carried out in local currency, under Russian law and using domestic infrastructure, a spokesperson told the newspaper. The securities will be listed on the Moscow Exchange, the largest stock exchange in the Russian Federation. Sber, which is the largest Russian bank in terms of assets, also prepares to give clients access to other exchange-traded instruments providing exposure to cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin futures. These will be available through its Sberinvestments mobile app, the bank official unveiled. Another majority state-owned bank, VTB, announced it’s going to offer qualified investors access to the new crypto-linked structured bonds, too. Two Russian commercial banks, T-Bank and Alfa-Bank, said they have developed Bitcoin-based digital financial assets ( DFAs ). Alexey Ilyasov, chief executive of Russian asset tokenization platform Atomize, and T-Bank’s partner in the DFA project, was quoted by Kommersant as stating: “More and more investors, from active traders and private banking clients to legal entities, are considering adding a reasonable amount of cryptocurrencies to their portfolio, including for the purposes of diversification and risk hedging.” Russian exchanges to begin trading Bitcoin futures Shortly after the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) announced it was legalizing crypto derivatives on Wednesday, the Moscow Exchange (MOEX) pulled the curtain on its plan to start the trading of a Bitcoin futures contract on a fund tracking the price of Bitcoin, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT). The digital currency quote will be expressed in U.S. dollars per lot and settlements will be made in Russian rubles, Kommersant and RBC detailed in separate reports. Trading will open on June 4 and the futures will expire in September. Meanwhile, the St. Petersburg Exchange (SPB) also revealed it intends to commence trading of futures tied to the value of cryptocurrencies. It told the Tass news agency that professional participants in the market have been already granted access to the contract, and they are currently testing it.

2025-06-02T14:37:57,"Analyst Spots Huge Liquidity Pool to Support XRP If it Falls to This Level","Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk), a prominent crypto analyst, has drawn attention to XRP’s current price action by highlighting a substantial liquidity pool around $2. In a recent post on X, he described it as the largest liquidity pool he has seen in a long time. This view is underpinned by a detailed liquidity chart, which confirms the dense concentration of buy and sell orders around this level. Liquidity Concentration and Technical Implications The attached liquidation heat map highlights a significant band of liquidity just above and below the $2 level. The analyst reveals that the $2 price zone is the most concentrated area of liquidity on the short-term chart and explains that while the asset’s price does not have to reach this level, the presence of such deep liquidity makes it a critical area to watch . He notes that if XRP does not revisit this zone, it would warrant caution for traders considering upside positions. However, recent analysis suggests that failure to hold certain crucial levels could send the digital asset back to $2. I don't trust a bounce here for $XRP . This is the largest liquidity pool I've seen in a long time tbh. I'd be suprised if we don't touch this area; https://t.co/EtfakyW8f7 pic.twitter.com/g8423sN4nI — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) June 1, 2025 We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The analyst also references the recent formation of an inverse head and shoulders pattern , which, if completed, would align with a move down to $2 before any significant upward reversal. Historical Context and Market Behavior Historically, the $2 level has acted as a resilient support for XRP. Each time the price has approached this mark, it has triggered substantial buy interest and subsequent rebounds. Cryptoinsightuk has previously drawn attention to the support at the $2 level, stating that he was ready to go all in on XRP if it hit that level, showing his conviction in the strength of this support. The resilience of the $2 support has led some prominent figures in the XRP community to liken it to the $0.5 level that held up the asset for years, suggesting that $2 could now serve as a long-term floor for the asset. What to Expect from XRP The analyst’s outlook is also influenced by broader market conditions. Should Bitcoin experience a pullback to the $100,000 level, it would be reasonable to expect XRP to follow suit and test the $2 liquidity pool. Cryptoinsightuk emphasizes that while a move to $2 is not guaranteed, the high concentration of open interest at this price makes it a likely target for any significant downward move. He cautions that this area is susceptible to price manipulation due to the volume of orders resting there, which could lead to a swift sweep of local lows before any potential upside.

2025-06-02T14:30:53,"Bitcoin Rise To $111,000 ATH Doesn’t Mean The Market Is Bullish, Certified Expert Says","Bitcoin’s bullish momentum has somewhat faded after reaching an all-time high of $111,000 on May 22, casting doubt on the sustainability of the rally. Bitcoin has pulled back slightly after its record-setting push, and analysts are split on what this means for its price action going forward. Interestingly, not everyone is convinced the recent all-time high reflects genuine strength. One of the most notable voices challenging this is certified crypto expert Tony “The Bull” Severino, who warned that Bitcoin’s move may not be as solid as it looks on the surface. In his assessment, Tony Severino argues that the breakout to $111,814 lacks the technical confirmation usually associated with a true bullish breakout. He noted that while BTCUSD did print a new high, other major trading pairs did not follow suit. Failed Breakout Indicates Weakness Rather Than Strength Particularly, Bitcoin failed to reach a new all-time high against currencies such as the Euro, British Pound, Japanese Yen, and the Swiss Franc. The same applies to BTC/XAU, Bitcoin’s price measured against gold, which currently lags far behind its former peak of 41 ounces per Bitcoin. At the time of writing, that pair is still hovering at 32 ounces, a significant difference that suggests the upward momentum is isolated to the US Dollar. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Trend Above $100,000: The Good News And The Bad News This divergence leads Severino to argue that the move could be a byproduct of the USD’s weakness rather than Bitcoin’s strength. A true bullish breakout, he says, would have been evident across multiple currency pairs and asset benchmarks. His skepticism is further reinforced by the structure of the charts, as seen in the six comparative panels he shared on the social media platform X. Most of them show Bitcoin forming lower highs or simply failing to match the previous all-time level. For instance, Bitcoin priced in euros is still well below its peak of €105,890, currently trading around €93,229. Similarly, Bitcoin has failed to breach the 17 million mark against the Japanese Yen and now sits at ¥15.28 million. The same trend is repeated in the Swiss Franc and British Pound pairings, with BTC / Swiss Franc failing to cross 99,254 and BTCGBP forming a lower high at $78,228. These price actions make it difficult to argue that Bitcoin is in a universally strong position, particularly when measured in anything other than USD. Caution With Next Monthly Candle Open In conclusion, Tony Severino warns traders and investors not to be misled by the surface-level optimism that comes with a new all-time high in BTCUSD. A single breakout, especially one lacking confirmation from cross-pair strength and fundamental indicators, does not necessarily signal the start of a new wave five or a sustained bullish trend for the Bitcoin price. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Big Drop For Bitcoin Price As Bearish Pressures Mount After $111,000 ATH According to him, the May monthly candle close and the June monthly candle open will be important in determining the next direction. If the current indecision tilts bearish, technicals could teeter back bearish towards a larger correction.

2025-06-02T14:30:50,"Analyst Unveils ‘Most Bullish Scenario’ for Bitcoin, Predicts Shallow BTC Pullback Before Leg up to Fresh Record Highs","An analyst known for making timely Bitcoin calls is outlining what he believes is the most bullish scenario for BTC as the crypto king struggles to sustain a rally above $110,000. In a new strategy session, pseudonymous analyst Credible tells his 70,100 YouTube subscribers that he thinks Bitcoin will not retest a key psychological level as support if BTC is in the midst of an aggressive uptrend. “If we are in the most bullish scenario, then we will not take these lows [at $100,000]. We’ll simply find buyers above these lows, will front run them and we’ll continue higher.” But the trader notes that even in the most bullish case, he expects BTC to witness a different kind of correction, one defined by time rather than price. “These corrective structures can drag out as we well know by now, and they take a lot of different shapes and forms, but at the end of the day what we have here is some combination of corrective, choppy price action before the next impulse starts. And so even if we make marginal higher highs, but if we’re not moving up with momentum, then we can pull back down and just chop around for a bit longer. I’d like the green zone to be tapped ideally. And in the most bullish case, that’s as low as we go. Whether we take the highs or not, it doesn’t matter. And then we just get more chop and then we erupt again impulsively.” Source: Credible/YouTube Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that BTC will surge to $140,000 in his most bullish scenario.

2025-06-02T14:30:08,"Bitcoin (BTC) and Altcoins Today's Focus is on FED Chairman Jerome Powell! What Time Will He Speak? Here's All You Need to Know!","Bitcoin (BTC) and the cryptocurrency market have experienced a decline in recent days as US customs duties, which were suspended by US President Donald Trump, have become a current issue again. Having fallen by 5.2% in the last week, BTC saw below $104,000, but with a slight recovery, it rose just above $104,000 again. Despite this decline, the expectation of an increase in Bitcoin and altcoins continues, and the agenda of the cryptocurrency sector today includes the speech to be made by US Federal Reserve (FED) Chairman Jerome Powell. Jerome Powell, who will speak at the 75th Anniversary Conference of the FED's International Finance Division at 20:00 Turkish time, will seek signals regarding the ongoing uncertainties in the global economy and the effects of tariffs on the United States. Global markets started the new week on a negative note, amid the uncertainty created by US President Donald Trump's decision to increase steel tariffs and his accusations against China that it violated the agreement. In addition, Powell's potential comments on developments regarding tariffs and the US administration's policies will also be closely monitored during the speech. Powell is expected to touch on many issues, including monetary policy, and is also expected to address the resignation claims. However, for now, Powell's resignation announcement remains a low possibility. As is known, Donald Trump does not want FED Chairman Powell for a long time and expects him to resign. Because the FED's failure to cut interest rates under Powell's chairmanship causes Trump to demand Powell's resignation. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-02T14:25:17,"Analyst Says Bitcoin Daily Close Above $104,674 Is Bullish. Here’s Why","Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, continues to capture the attention of analysts, traders, and investors as it dances around historic price levels. According to a recent analysis shared by popular crypto analyst Egrag Crypto on X, Bitcoin’s near-term bullish outlook hinges on a key price milestone: a daily close above $104,674. This level, Egrag explains, is not just a psychological barrier but a critical technical juncture. It aligns with the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the Fibonacci 0.888 retracement level, both known indicators of market strength and momentum. A daily close above this threshold would signal strong bullish sentiment, suggesting that buyers are in control and that Bitcoin could soon chart a path toward new all-time highs (ATH). #BTC – Daily Close Above $104,674 Is Bullish! For #BTC to remain bullish, it must close above $104,674 on the daily chart. This level aligns with the 21 EMA and the Fib 0.888 – signaling strong bullish momentum. However, a different scenario could play out: A #Bearish … pic.twitter.com/h0Q6wmMkC9 — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) June 2, 2025 Why $104,674 Matters To understand the significance of the $104,674 mark, one must consider how technical analysis plays a role in crypto markets. The 21 EMA is often viewed as a dynamic support or resistance level. When the price trades above this average, it generally signals that the prevailing trend is bullish. In combination, the Fibonacci 0.888 retracement level is regarded by many traders as a “last line” of retracement before a continuation of the larger trend, in this case, upward. Egrag Crypto’s post highlights that a daily close above this level will cement bullish momentum, increasing the probability that Bitcoin will push past resistance levels and aim for new price discoveries beyond its previous highs. The Bearish Alternative: Watching Key Support Levels While the bullish scenario is compelling, Egrag Crypto prudently outlines an alternative, more cautious possibility: a bearish retest. Should Bitcoin fail to maintain a daily close above $104,674, the analyst points to the Fibonacci 0.618 level as the next critical support zone. This level has historically acted as a sturdy floor during pullbacks, providing the foundation for recovery and fresh rallies. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, if this support fails to hold, Egrag warns that the market could experience a deeper correction, potentially driving Bitcoin’s price down to the Fibonacci 0.5 zone. Such a move would likely trigger a wick, a temporary sharp price dip, that could flush out leveraged positions and shake weaker hands before any subsequent recovery. For traders, this scenario underscores the importance of risk management and close monitoring of market reactions at key support levels. Volume as the Confirmation Signal Beyond price action and chart patterns, volume remains the ultimate confirmation signal. Egrag emphasizes that traders must observe whether daily volume aligns with price movements to determine the strength of the breakout or retracement. A breakout to new ATHs without corresponding volume could indicate a lack of conviction among market participants, raising the risk of a swift reversal. Conversely, a breakout supported by surging volume would provide stronger confirmation that the bullish trend is intact and sustainable. For now, the crypto community waits with bated breath. Bitcoin’s position near critical technical levels makes it a magnet for both bullish and bearish speculation. Whether the market leans toward new highs or a retracement first, one thing is clear: as long as Bitcoin hovers near these pivotal zones, the next few daily closes will be crucial in shaping its medium-term trajectory.

2025-06-02T14:24:48,"Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq slip as U.S.-China trade tensions linger","Stocks opened lower on Monday, June 2 as investors began the new month on fresh jitters amid the ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China. Global stocks saw some downside action as Asian and European markets closed lower and U.S. stocks slipped. For the major U.S. indices, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 160 points. Investor jitters also saw the S&P 500 pull back 0.4% and Nasdaq Composite open 0.5% down. A resilient stock market ended May in bullish territory despite the notable tariff -driven downswings that punctuated sentiment throughout the month. Dow edged 4% higher in May, while Nasdaq led the gains with 9% over the month amid some huge earnings-driven performances. Perhaps more notably was the S&P 500 marching to its best May performance since 1990, and the best overall month since November 2023. Tailwinds that pushed stocks higher also catalyzed gains for cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) storming to its all-time high above $111k. However, like the broader risk assets market, Bitcoin price is down and near $104k. Across the market, the U.S. dollar fell slightly and gold rose as flight to safe haven assets reemerged. Meanwhile, oil prices jumped following news that OPEC+ plans a much smaller hike in output than the market anticipated. On Saturday, OPEC+, encompassing a group of global oil producers, announced an increase of 411,000 barrels of oil a day. You might also like: Dow inches higher, S&P 500 caps best May since 1990 The latest pullback for stocks comes as investors weigh ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions. Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump spooked investors when he threatened to increase tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%. It followed Trump’s claim that China had “violated” the trade agreement recently agreed in Geneva, Switzerland. But China has hit back, noting the U.S. has failed to honor its part of the deal. This fresh escalation threatens to inject negative sentiment in the market. While Trump’s tax bill is in focus this week amid a series of data releases, tariffs will likely be among top factors to watch. Eyes will also be on the geopolitical front after Ukraine’s drone strikes against Russia. Despite these factors, Tom Lee, co-founder and managing partner of Fundstrat, is bullish on the S&P 500. Lee shared his outlook with CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’, noting that the index has a higher chance of hitting 6,600 going forward than it was in February. The S&P 500 hovers around 5,911, up from 4,982 in early April. It topped around 6,144 in February 2025.

2025-06-02T14:24:31,"Best Crypto to Buy Now As Ethereum ETPs Record Massive Surge","Bitcoin’s recent decline to the $103,000 range may have rattled overly-leveraged traders like James Wynn, but altcoins—especially Ether—are showing a much firmer stance than expected. While Bitcoin ETPs are seeing minor outflows, Ether investment products have taken a sharply different trajectory. Instead of buckling under market pressure, Ether-based ETPs have drawn significant investor interest. The largest altcoin by market cap appears to be experiencing a quiet momentum shift, with capital flowing in at levels not seen since the last bullish stretch of 2024. That suggests something deeper at play than simple price action. Ether ETPs Are Soaking Up Liquidity as Bitcoin ETFs Face Profit-Taking Last week’s crypto ETP flows tell a tale of two trends—Bitcoin, the market giant, saw outflows, while Ether surged ahead with the strongest inflows seen since December 2024. According to data released by CoinShares, Ether ETPs brought in a remarkable $321 million in a single week. In contrast, Bitcoin investment products slipped by $8 million, signaling the end of a six-week inflow streak. This reversal comes at a time when Bitcoin’s price dipped nearly 6% within a week, sparking selling activity and apparent seasonal caution. The surge in Ether inflows has been attributed to improving fundamentals within its ecosystem, from stronger futures activity to signs of technical resilience. After being written off by some firms earlier in May as a “meme-like” asset, ETH seems to be regaining serious investor confidence. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's drop—triggered partly by broader macro factors like tariff uncertainty and profit-taking—highlighted its vulnerability to short-term swings, especially after its rally to $110,000. JUST IN: ETH sees $321 million in net inflows last week, highest since December 2024 - CoinShares. pic.twitter.com/ptDSzSJXFF — Whale Insider (@WhaleInsider) June 2, 2025 Despite Ether’s sharp pullback from $2,771 to around $2,400, investors appear to be treating the dip as an accumulation zone rather than a red flag. Over the past 30 days, ETH has still added 36% to its value—enough to reignite interest that had been fading just weeks ago. The renewed appetite for Ether ETPs isn't just about a single asset finding its footing again. It may signal a major change in sentiment, where investors are beginning to look beyond Bitcoin for value. If capital continues flowing into Ether while BTC stalls, it could pave the way for renewed interest across altcoins more widely. Quiet confidence in Ethereum often acts as a bellwether—and this shift, if it holds, could be the first real hint that alt season isn’t far behind. Best Crypto to Buy Now as Altcoins Expect a Boost SUBBD With Ether’s ETPs soaking up liquidity, attention is clearly shifting toward assets that offer more than price action—and SUBBD fits squarely into that narrative. Built as a token that reimagines the creator economy, SUBBD allows content creators to monetize directly through blockchain-backed loyalty, subscriptions, and ownership models. It isn’t a passive asset—it’s designed for interaction, activity, and value exchange between creators and their communities. In a climate where capital is beginning to look beyond Bitcoin’s slow movements and Ether’s recovery, projects like SUBBD carry particular relevance. The platform gives creators complete control without middlemen, while fans gain tokenized access to exclusive perks and long-term engagement incentives. Every subscription or contribution is recorded transparently, turning fan support into something with both emotional and financial resonance. Recent Ether ETP inflows suggest investors are open to smart contract-driven platforms with actual use cases—an encouraging backdrop for a project like SUBBD that operates entirely on-chain. While Bitcoin struggles with short-term volatility and seasonal hesitations, SUBBD benefits from steadily growing utility and an expanding list of creators opting in. As the market tests which assets can retain momentum in uncertain phases, utility-driven tokens may gain the upper hand. SUBBD’s structure is geared toward consistency, not speculation—and in a week where Ether saw inflows of over $300 million, that signals a broader willingness to back projects with actual value propositions. SUBBD isn’t chasing hype—it’s offering architecture. Solaxy While Ethereum ETPs absorb investor flows and Bitcoin ETFs show signs of strain, a quiet recalibration seems to be underway—and Solaxy lands right in that pocket of renewed investor interest. The project is structured as a Layer 2 that supports both Ethereum and Solana ecosystems, offering faster transactions, cross-chain compatibility, and strong staking incentives through its native SOLX token. In a week where Ethereum gained favor due to its ecosystem strength, Solaxy’s premise of amplifying L1 capabilities feels timely. SOLX staking delivers robust rewards without locking users into long-term illiquidity. The APY is backed by protocol activity and ecosystem incentives, not arbitrary emissions, which makes it more attractive to those looking for sustainable passive returns. Ether’s recent inflow strength shows that appetite for high-utility, smart-contract-compatible platforms is returning. Investors who may have missed Ethereum’s recent entry point are already exploring adjacent narratives, and Solaxy—by enhancing the very infrastructure ETH operates on—is positioned as a natural next step. As market participants re-evaluate their portfolios, projects that support scalability, low fees, and fluid interoperability are likely to stand out. $SOLX is showing NO signs of slowing down! 🚀43M Raised! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/kktQdy34kA — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) June 1, 2025 The project has raised upwards of $43 million, which makes it one of the biggest utility memecoin presales this year. Solaxy doesn’t try to fight ETH or SOL—it tries to make them better. And that cooperative value proposition is exactly what capital seems to favor right now. The broader takeaway from the Ether inflow data is that the market is leaning toward structured, function-driven projects—and Solaxy’s blueprint fits that shift with precision. Snorter As Ether’s resurgence triggers inflows into ETPs and reignites belief in solid infrastructure projects, some investors are shifting focus toward functional tools that enhance trading itself—enter Snorter . It’s a Telegram-based trading assistant designed to help users scan, snipe, and act on token launches within seconds, particularly across the Solana ecosystem. In short: it’s not a meme, it’s a mechanism. While the broader market shuffles around BTC hesitation and ETH inflow momentum, Snorter’s appeal lies in its timing. With retail attention once again fixating on altcoins, tools that reduce friction and increase execution speed become invaluable. The bot doesn’t just offer token tracking—it simplifies complex moves into one-tap actions, letting traders act swiftly in a space where seconds often define success. Ether’s recent performance proved one thing clearly: function is finding favor again. Investors are looking at what a project does, not just what it represents. Snorter leans hard into that mentality, offering real-world utility instead of promises. As a tool crafted for this exact kind of market phase—volatile, opportunity-laden, and moving fast—it provides a tactical edge to anyone navigating presales or early launches. The idea behind Snorter isn’t new, but the execution is cleaner, faster, and aligned with trader priorities. In a time when ETH is being re-evaluated for its functionality and resilience, projects like Snorter remind us that infrastructure isn’t just about blockchains—it’s also about access, precision, and how quickly you can move when the window opens. BTC Bull With the recent developments within the crypto space, one thing becomes obvious- a pattern is beginning to take shape, with investors not just seeking the big names anymore. They’re looking for projects that actually offer something valuable. BTC Bull is built with that exact philosophy in mind. Rather than offering exposure to Bitcoin alone, it links its own token utility to Bitcoin’s price movements in real time, transforming BTC’s rally phases into direct user rewards. The concept is straightforward, yet surprisingly absent in many Bitcoin-aligned projects. BTC Bull distributes airdrops to token holders whenever Bitcoin crosses predetermined price thresholds. As BTC climbs, so do the perks—creating a system that rewards bullish sentiment rather than just tracking it. At the same time, a built-in token burn mechanism ensures that supply tightens alongside rising participation, preserving value over time and encouraging long-term holding behavior. This is particularly relevant now, as capital seems to be rotating away from passive Bitcoin products and toward altcoins or hybrid assets offering additional layers of functionality. BTC Bull doesn’t abandon Bitcoin—it amplifies it, offering holders a way to participate in the upside without relying on leverage or ETFs. Top YouTube channels like 99Bitcoins , along with other top websites and creators, have also endorsed the project strongly in recent weeks. Ether’s ETP success this week showed that investor confidence is returning to assets with solid mechanics and measurable performance. BTC Bull taps into that shift with a model that isn’t speculative fluff—it’s designed to move with Bitcoin, but pay you for the ride. In a post-ETP world, that kind of proactive utility is exactly what many are hunting for. Conclusion In a week where Ether’s resurgence has reshaped where capital is flowing, it’s becoming clear that investor interest is gravitating toward utility, structure, and timing rather than blind speculation. With traditional Bitcoin products seeing fatigue and altcoin-linked platforms gaining traction, the right move now may lie in projects that respond actively to market momentum. For those seeking exposure with purpose, the entries above may offer a stronger footing in what’s shaping up to be a crucial phase in the cycle.

This rebound, while notable, now approaches a critical confluence zone that could decide whether Bitcoin price action extends toward $108K or stalls again amid resistance. The broader trend remains bullish, but momentum indicators suggest some caution as BTC tests another short-term hurdle. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price?

2025-06-02T14:20:21,"UK Crypto Trading Unlocks Exciting New Era for Retail Investors via IG Group","BitcoinWorld UK Crypto Trading Unlocks Exciting New Era for Retail Investors via IG Group Big news is brewing for the world of UK crypto trading ! A major player in the financial services industry, IG Group, has officially opened the doors to spot cryptocurrency trading for its retail client base. This development marks a significant step in making direct crypto asset ownership more accessible within the United Kingdom’s regulated financial landscape. For many prospective investors, this provides a new, potentially simpler pathway to engage with digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. What Does the New IG Group Crypto Offering Mean for You? IG Group, a company listed on the UK stock exchange with a long history in trading services, announced on June 2 that its customers can now directly buy and sell a selection of cryptocurrencies. This isn’t just about trading derivatives; it’s about accessing the underlying assets themselves. This move into IG Group crypto trading is facilitated through a strategic partnership with Uphold, a U.S.-based digital asset platform that holds regulatory status in both the United States and the United Kingdom. This collaboration is key, leveraging Uphold’s infrastructure and regulatory standing to offer the service. The initial rollout provides access to 31 different cryptocurrencies. This selection includes the heavy hitters and some newer, popular coins: Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) XRP Solana (SOL) Cardano (ADA) Polygon (MATIC) Polkadot (DOT) Litecoin (LTC) Popular memecoins like Bonk (BONK) The list is designed to offer a decent breadth of the market, from established large-caps to some of the more speculative, trending assets. For those looking to diversify or simply get started, having this range available through a familiar provider like IG Group is a notable advantage. Why is Spot Crypto Trading Gaining Traction Among Retail Crypto Investors? Historically, many traditional brokers offered crypto exposure primarily through derivatives like CFDs (Contracts For Difference). While these instruments allow speculation on price movements, they don’t involve owning the actual cryptocurrency. Spot crypto trading , however, means you are buying and selling the real asset. When you buy Bitcoin on a spot market, you own Bitcoin. This direct ownership is often preferred by long-term holders or those who wish to potentially use their crypto for transactions or other purposes beyond pure price speculation. For retail crypto investors in the UK, this shift offers several potential benefits: Direct Ownership: You hold the actual digital asset. Simplicity: For many, the concept of buying and holding an asset is more straightforward than understanding derivative contracts. Accessibility: Integrating crypto trading into an existing IG Group account simplifies the onboarding process for current customers. Regulatory Clarity (via Partner): The partnership with Uphold, a regulated entity in the UK, provides a layer of confidence regarding compliance and operational standards. This move by IG Group reflects a growing demand from their client base and the broader market trend towards providing more direct access to digital assets. Can You Now Easily Trade Bitcoin UK and Other Cryptos? Yes, the launch means that for IG Group’s UK customers, the ability to Trade Bitcoin UK , along with Ethereum, XRP, and 28 other cryptocurrencies, is now integrated into their platform. This significantly lowers the barrier to entry for individuals who might already be trading other asset classes like stocks, indices, or forex with IG Group. Instead of needing to open accounts on separate, dedicated crypto exchanges, they can potentially manage a portion of their digital asset portfolio alongside their traditional investments. Getting started typically involves: Logging into your IG Group account (or opening one). Navigating to the crypto trading section. Completing any necessary additional verification steps required for crypto services. Funding your account. Placing buy or sell orders for the available cryptocurrencies. The partnership with Uphold handles the underlying execution and custody of the digital assets, streamlining the process for the end user. What Does This Mean for the Future of Spot Crypto Trading in the UK? IG Group’s entry into spot crypto trading is a strong signal about the increasing institutional confidence in the digital asset space, even within the UK’s evolving regulatory framework. As more established financial firms offer direct crypto access, it could lead to increased liquidity, greater market maturity, and potentially attract a wider pool of investors who prefer to trade through well-known, regulated entities. While this is a positive development for accessibility, it’s crucial for retail crypto investors to remember the inherent risks involved in cryptocurrency markets. Prices can be highly volatile, and investments can lose value rapidly. Education about the specific assets being traded and understanding market dynamics remains paramount. Conclusion: A New Chapter for UK Crypto Trading The launch of spot crypto trading by IG Group, in partnership with Uphold, represents a notable advancement for the UK crypto trading landscape. By offering direct access to 31 cryptocurrencies, including the ability to Trade Bitcoin UK easily, IG Group is catering to the growing demand from its retail crypto investors . This move into spot crypto trading through a regulated partner like Uphold provides a more integrated and potentially more comfortable route into the digital asset market for many. As this service rolls out, it will be interesting to see its impact on the broader adoption of cryptocurrencies among mainstream UK investors.
