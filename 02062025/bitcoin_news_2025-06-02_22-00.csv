2025-06-02T19:55:54,"Meta Shareholders Vote To Shut Down Bitcoin Treasury Proposal in Near-Unanimous Decision","Shareholders at Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta have decided to shoot down a proposed Bitcoin ( BTC ) treasury for the tech giant. According to an 8-K Filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from last week, the vast majority of Meta shareholders voted against a BTC treasury proposal as a hedge against inflation. “On May 28, 2025, Meta Platforms, Inc. (the “Company”) held its annual meeting of shareholders via live audio webcast… At the Annual Meeting, the Company’s shareholders voted on fourteen proposals, each of which is described in more detail in the Company’s definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 17, 2025… At the beginning of the Annual Meeting, there were 1,769,720,699 shares of Class A common stock and 342,865,499 shares of Class B common stock present or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting, which represented 92.61% of the combined voting power of the shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting (voting together as a single class), and which constituted a quorum for the transaction of business.” According to the filing, 3.9 million shares voted for the proposed treasury, while 4.9 billion shares voted it down. Since founder Mark Zuckerberg controls approximately 60% of the shares, it can be reasonably assumed that Zuckerberg voted against the measure. Despite the BTC Treasury vote, Meta is still reportedly eyeing a venture into stablecoins amid growing interest and demand for digital assets.

2025-06-02T19:53:22,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: $104K in Play, $109K Target Looms Amid Global Shakeups","Bitcoin is trading at $104,434, down 0.55% over the last 24 hours, with a trading volume topping $43 billion. This follows a wave of bold announcements—and abrupt clarifications—coming from Pakistan’s top officials. Bilal Bin Saqib, a special assistant to the Prime Minister, revealed plans at Bitcoin Vegas 2025 to create a national Bitcoin reserve and state-backed wallet. The initiative aimed to repurpose 2,000 megawatts of excess electricity for AI data centers and Bitcoin mining—a bold play to attract global investors. Pakistan’s govt within 20 hours: 1. “We have a Bitcoin reserve!” 2. “Crypto is still illegal.” Zero coherence. Zero accountability. Kya مسلط kar diya hai Pakistan par. pic.twitter.com/qxZKasHdsw — Sikander Fayyaz Bhadera (@SikanderFayyaz) May 30, 2025 But celebrations were short-lived. Just days later, Pakistan’s Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal denied any official shift in crypto policy. He emphasized that cryptocurrencies remain illegal unless formally approved by the government. This contradiction has caused confusion, especially as Pakistan’s newly formed Digital Assets Authority aims to align policies with global standards, including FATF compliance. Bitcoin Reserve Chaos: Pakistan’s Big Reveal Crushed by Own Government https://t.co/gQ9uET4spN — Metatron Apps-OTC $MRNJ (@MetatronInc) June 2, 2025 While Saqib’s proposal sparked enthusiasm, critics—especially from the IMF—flagged concerns about energy use and financial risks. In the short term, mixed signals from the government have sparked both optimism and skepticism. However, Pakistan’s steps toward structured regulation point to longer-term opportunities for Bitcoin’s integration. Czech Minister Resigns Over $45M Bitcoin Scandal The crypto world was rocked when Czech Justice Minister Pavel Blazek stepped down after it emerged that his ministry sold nearly $45 million in Bitcoin, donated by convicted drug trafficker Tomas Jirikovsky. Intended to fund prison projects and digital justice reforms, the funds were accepted without proper vetting, under the assumption that Jirikovsky was trying to make amends. Czech Justice Minister resigns over $45M Bitcoin donation tied to convicted criminal. Now under police probe for possible money laundering. pic.twitter.com/csPVW42nWm — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) May 31, 2025 When it was revealed that the Bitcoin originated from the notorious dark web platform, Sheep Marketplace, public outrage erupted. Despite impending elections, Blazek resigned, and an investigation is now underway. Although this scandal has dampened sentiment, the Czech Republic’s broader move to align with the EU’s MiCA framework might restore investor confidence in the long run. South Korea’s Crypto Industry Could Win Big, Regardless of Election Outcome In South Korea, more than 18 million people actively participate in crypto markets. With the June 3 snap presidential election approaching, both frontrunners—Lee Jae-myung and Kim Moon-soo—have pledged support for crypto-friendly policies. NO MATTER WHO WINS SOUTH KOREA'S ELECTION TOMORROW, #CRYPTO WINS! BOTH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ARE PRO-DIGITAL ASSETS. pic.twitter.com/5jcvBj2JxR — The Moon Show (@TheMoonShow) June 2, 2025 Lee’s proposals include legalizing spot Bitcoin ETFs, introducing a won-backed stablecoin, and allowing the national pension fund to invest in crypto. Kim has similarly championed ETF approval and regulatory easing. This rare bipartisan alignment reflects growing public demand and positions South Korea as a crypto hub in the making. Regardless of who wins, legal clarity and institutional support could drive long-term adoption and fuel Bitcoin’s price growth. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: A Breakout to $109K or Reversal? On the charts, Bitcoin is navigating a descending wedge pattern on the 2-hour timeframe—a setup that often precedes a bullish reversal. Resistance looms at $105,352, aligning with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement and the 50-period EMA. Candlestick patterns near $104,514 (23.6% Fibonacci) suggest market indecision, with the MACD histogram narrowing and signal lines converging—signs of waning bearish momentum. If Bitcoin breaks decisively above $105,352 with solid volume, it could climb toward $106,719 (61.8% Fibonacci) and even target $109,000 in the coming sessions. However, failure to break through could send prices back toward $103,149 or even $101,275. Long Setup: Buy on a confirmed breakout above $105,352, target $106,719–$109K, stop below $104,514. Short Setup: Enter on rejection at $105,352, target $103,149–$101,275, stop above $105,500. Patience is essential—wait for clear price action and volume confirmation before making your move. Best Wallet ($BEST): Redefining Crypto Storage and Access Best Wallet is setting new standards for crypto wallets, combining security, usability, and early-stage investment options. With a user-friendly app available on Google Play and the App Store, it supports over 1,000 cryptocurrencies. It is the first wallet to use Fireblocks MPC-CMP technology for advanced security. Key features include the Upcoming Tokens page, which allows users to purchase presale tokens directly within the app, eliminating the need to connect external wallets to unfamiliar sites. The $BEST token offers benefits such as reduced transaction fees, enhanced staking rewards, governance rights, and access to exclusive airdrops and quests.

2025-06-02T19:43:45,"XAUUSD weekly forecast: $3600 next target for gold?","Last week, Donald Trump’s delay on European tariffs marked the return of the bullish rally on gold, and this week, the escalation of war between Ukraine and Russia, has further brought buying pressure in gold. Gold is now comfortably trading over $3350, and aiming for $3400 and possibly a new all-time high above $3500 as well. Table of Contents Previous week’s forecast recap of crypto.news Key economic events of this week Gold HTF Overview Gold Forecast for June 2nd to June 6th Trading Strategies & Investment Recommendation Similar to last week, the bias is gold is buy, upon retracement to specific levels. Let’s discuss the key pivot levels for gold buying and selling in this XAUUSD weekly forecast of June 2nd to June 6th, 2025. Previous week’s forecast recap of crypto.news In the previous week’s forecast we gave a 4h zone as high probability for buys, which was from $3260-$3208. Price is now up 1100 points from that zone and has the potential to run to $3400 and beyond. XAUUSD 4h chart – Source: Tradingview Other levels shared in the last week’s forecast have not hit yet, but they remain valid, so do keep an eye out for them as well. Now let’s start by discussing the key economic events of this week and their possible impact on the price of XAUUSD. Key economic events of this week Some significant U.S. economic reports are scheduled for release this week that are expected to impact XAUUSD . Monday, June 2nd ISM Manufacturing PMI A higher-than-expected PMI may strengthen the USD and put downward pressure on gold. Gold prices would probably be supported by a weak reading. Fed Chair Powell Speaks Powell may suggest aggressive policy or rate rises, which would cause the USD to rise and drive gold lower. Usually, gold would be lifted by dovish remarks. Tuesday, June 3 Job Openings at JOLTS Increased job vacancies indicate a strong labor market, which would strengthen the USD and depress gold. Lower values might have the reverse effect. Wednesday, June 4 ADP Non-Farm Employment Change Strong ADP data indicates labor strength, which weighs on gold and increases the USD. On the basis of recession fears, a miss might lead to gold buying. ISM Services PMI Excellent services PMI supports bearish gold sentiment, optimistic USD sentiment, and economic resilience. The demand for gold is supported by a lower reading. Thursday, June 5 Unemployment Claims Gold may suffer from fewer claims, which show the strength of labor. Growing claims may indicate economic strain and raise the price of gold. Friday, June 6 Average Hourly Earnings m/m Increased salaries indicate inflationary pressure, which could lead to Fed tightening bets (bearish on gold, bullish on the USD). Non-Farm Employment Change Gold declines and the dollar rises when the NFP report is strong. Weak numbers increase recession fears and are frequently positive for gold. Unemployment Rate A decrease in unemployment is both good for the USD and bad for gold. Gold as a safe haven is usually supported by an increase.

XAUUSD 1w chart – Source: Tradingview Gold Forecast for June 2nd to June 6th Gold is showing bullish momentum in all lower time frames which makes buying an ideal position to enter and hold. In the 1 hour timeframe the strongest buying level is coming up at the weekly open, opening gap, and 1 hour structure level of $3303-3295. XAUUSD 1h chart – Source: Tradingview On the 30m timeframe there is an immediate buying opportunity as well from the levels of $3325-3336. This is due to the 30 min FVG, and structure level.

2025-06-02T19:41:35,"Meta, Microsoft and Amazon reject Bitcoin: Was this the right call?","Just 0.1% of Meta shareholders backed a proposal to add Bitcoin to its treasury, joining Amazon and Microsoft in making similar decisions. Here’s what investors are saying. Meta’s decisive shareholder vote rejected the idea of adding Bitcoin (BTC) to its balance sheet, aligning with similar moves by Microsoft and Amazon in similar decisions. According to an SEC filing , just 0.1% of shareholders voted in favor, while 95% voted against. For some, this suggests that tech firms are still lagging in Bitcoin adoption. For one, Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, believes tech firms are missing out . He pointed out that Meta’s large cash positions are already speculative. If the dollar falls, so will their cash reserves, and Bitcoin could serve as a way to diversify. “They are already hoarding fiat with $30B in cash, up from $12B in 2023,” Matthew Sigel, VanEck. Sigel acknowledged that this accounts for just 2% of Meta’s market cap. However, other companies—including Netflix, Google, and Verizon, hold fewer reserves, and some even carry significant amounts of debt.

Bitcoin is not gaining traction among major firms Bitcoin has recently gained attention as with more and more companies increased their positions. One of them is GameStop, which invested $519 million in BTC. However, as many have pointed out, most of the companies doing big Bitcoin plays tend to struggle in their core business, with GameStop being no exception . In many cases, these companies are hoping that speculative interest around Bitcoin could boost their stock price. However, in GameStop’s case, the success was momentary, with its share price falling from a high of $35 shortly after the acquisition. For successful businesses like Meta, Bitcoin is a less compelling buy. For Meta investors, including investment giants like BlackRock, Vanguard, and Fidelity, traditional risk management is sufficient. On the other hand, Bitcoin is still seen as too risky to hold.

Analyst Says Wait For This To Happen First","Dogecoin has dipped below $0.2 as part of a broader crypto market correction, providing a buying opportunity for investors. However, crypto analyst DecyX had indicated that investors should wait for this to happen before they accumulate the foremost meme coin. Analyst Reveals What To Wait For Before Buying Dogecoin In an X post , DecyX told investors to wait for Dogecoin to grab the liquidity under $0.187 before accumulating the meme coin. He added that they should look for bullish price action on the lower timeframes (LTFs) and target the imbalance zone between $0.213 and $0.215. The analyst believes that a full fill could send DOGE to above $0.235. DecyX also noted that the Fair Value Gap (FVG) above is still untouched and that the $0.2597 strong high is a magnet long-term for Dogecoin. His statements come just as the meme coin dropped below the psychological $0.2 level. This price decline has occurred following the Bitcoin price correction from its all-time high (ATH) recorded two weeks ago. In an X post , crypto analyst Kevin Capital told Dogecoin holders that they want to see the meme coin hold onto between $0.1901 and $0.1839. His accompanying chart showed that failure to hold between this range could send DOGE to as low as $0.17. The analyst has on several occasions drawn the correlation between the Dogecoin and Bitcoin price. In another X post , he commented on the Bitcoin price and warned that things could get “sketchy” for the flagship crypto, meaning that DOGE is also at risk. Kevin Capital noted that the weekly close for Bitcoin was below $106,800, which puts it back in the danger zone. The analyst remarked that it needs to return above that level within the coming days to avoid things becoming sketchy. DOGE Could Be Bottoming Out In an X post , crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade stated that Dogecoin could be forming a double bottom on the 4-hour chart. His chart showed that he expects a reversal from the $0.18 zone, with the meme coin rallying back above the psychological $0.2 zone . The analyst also alluded to Dogecoin’s daily chart , revealing a hidden Bullish Divergence on DOGE’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) . He stated that the meme coin is creating a higher low on the daily chart, while its RSI shows a lower low. Meanwhile, the analyst revealed that Dogecoin is breaking out from a Symmetrical triangle on the 1-hour chart. A breakout from this triangle is also expected to send the meme coin above the $0.2 level.

2025-06-02T19:25:48,"Bitcoin structurally strong despite major pullback: Bitfinex analysts","Bitcoin has seen a major pullback from its all-time high of $111,880, as a macroeconomic reversal wipes out futures traders. Bitcoin ( BTC ) remains strong after a pullback from a major rally, states a report by Bitfinex analysts, released on Monday, June 2. After reaching its all-time high of $111,880 with a 50% rally in just 45 days, the asset has encountered significant macroeconomic pressure. Notably, reinstated tariffs resulted in a sharp spike in Treasury yields, with 30-year Treasury yields rising above 5 percent. These factors are fueling risk-off sentiment, which is affecting both stocks and Bitcoin. Moreover, the Bitcoin derivatives market, Bitfinex analysts explain, is likely overheated. Still, the report suggests that Bitcoin remains in a strong position. “Despite the pullback, we believe Bitcoin remains structurally strong. This correction appears to be a healthy reset rather than a breakdown—driven by leverage flushing and profit realisation after one of the sharpest recoveries in crypto history,” Bitfinex report. You might also like: Bitcoin ETFs ended six-week inflow streak over macro jitters and BTC slump Bitcoin faces macro uncertainty, profit taking Bitfinex analysts note that open interest rose to an all-time high of $49.4 billion, indicating that traders are increasingly hedging their bets and speculating on the asset. In both cases, this suggests that traders are anticipating more volatility. You might also like: Will Bitcoin and altcoins rise in June, or is a new crypto winter coming?

2025-06-02T19:20:55,"Korean Crypto Community: Unveiling Top Tokens Searched and Discussed","BitcoinWorld Korean Crypto Community: Unveiling Top Tokens Searched and Discussed The world of cryptocurrency moves at lightning speed, and staying informed about where interest is surging is crucial for anyone navigating the market. While global trends often dominate headlines, regional insights, especially from highly active markets like South Korea, can offer unique perspectives. This is where understanding the pulse of the Korean crypto community becomes invaluable. We’ve tapped into exclusive data from Bitcoin World to bring you a snapshot of the tokens that captured the most attention within the South Korean crypto community during the week of May 23 to 29. By analyzing both search volume and mentions, we can gain a clearer picture of what’s driving curiosity and conversation among Korean investors and enthusiasts. Why Understanding South Korea Crypto Trends Matters South Korea has long been recognized as a significant player in the global cryptocurrency market. Its tech-savvy population, high internet penetration, and enthusiastic adoption of digital technologies have made it a hotbed for crypto trading and innovation. Trends originating or gaining traction within the country can sometimes foreshadow broader market movements or highlight specific projects gaining serious momentum. Monitoring South Korea crypto trends provides valuable intelligence for investors worldwide. Top Searched Crypto Korea: What Were Investors Looking For? Curiosity often starts with a search. The tokens with the highest search volumes indicate which projects or assets people are actively researching, likely driven by recent news, price movements, or general interest. Here’s what the data revealed for the week: Rank Token Search Volume 1 XRP 38,370 2 ETH 18,054 3 BTC 16,025 4 SOPH 9,159 5 SUI 8,660 6 ONDO 8,147 7 MOVE 5,537 8 SOL 5,461 9 EOS 4,079 10 NXPC 3,991 XRP stands out significantly, nearly doubling the search volume of the second-place token, Ethereum (ETH). This suggests ongoing strong interest, perhaps related to legal developments or community anticipation. ETH and BTC maintain their positions as foundational assets, consistently ranking high. What’s particularly interesting are the newer or less globally prominent tokens like SOPH, SUI, ONDO, MOVE, EOS, and NXPC making the top searched crypto Korea list, indicating specific regional interest or recent developments within those projects resonating with the Korean audience. K-Community Crypto Buzz: What Were They Discussing? Beyond just searching for information, what are people actively talking about? Mention data reflects ongoing discussions, sentiment, and community engagement around specific tokens. Here’s the list of the most mentioned tokens in the K-community crypto space: Rank Token Mentions 1 BTC 1,415 2 ETH 603 3 TRUMP 293 4 XRP 170 5 SOL 159 6 SUI 99 7 VIRTUAL 45 8 NXPC 44 9 PEPE 39 10 ONDO 38 Interestingly, while XRP dominated searches, BTC and ETH lead the mention count, suggesting they are central to broader market discussions and sentiment analysis. The appearance of the TRUMP token at number three is notable, indicating that politically linked or meme-style tokens can generate significant discussion volume, even if search interest isn’t as high. Other tokens like SOL, SUI, NXPC, PEPE, and ONDO also feature in discussions, mirroring some of the search trends but with different relative prominence. Comparing Search vs. Mention: What Does It Tell Us? The differences between the search and mention lists offer valuable insights: High Search, Lower Mention (e.g., XRP, SOPH, MOVE, EOS): People are actively seeking information. This could be due to recent news, potential investment opportunities they are researching, or trying to understand a project. The conversation might be happening elsewhere or is less consolidated in the monitored K-Community channels. High Mention, Lower Search (e.g., TRUMP, VIRTUAL, PEPE): These tokens are generating buzz and discussion, possibly driven by social media trends, specific events, or their nature as speculative or community-driven assets. The conversation itself might be the primary driver of interest, rather than in-depth research. Consistent High Ranking (e.g., BTC, ETH, SUI, ONDO, NXPC): These tokens are both being actively researched and discussed, indicating sustained and broad interest within the community. This comparison highlights that search volume often reflects initial or specific information-seeking behavior, while mentions indicate active community engagement and sentiment around a token. What Drove Interest in These Tokens Last Week? Pinpointing the exact reasons for the surge in interest for each token during this specific week (May 23-29) would require deeper analysis of news and events surrounding each project during that period. However, based on the Bitcoin World data , we can infer that factors likely included: Recent price volatility or significant price movements. Major project updates, partnerships, or roadmap milestones. Listing announcements on popular exchanges. General market sentiment influencing interest in major assets like BTC and ETH. Social media trends and community hype, especially for tokens like TRUMP and PEPE. Understanding these drivers is key to interpreting the data beyond just the numbers. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor So, how can you use this information about the Korean crypto community ‘s focus? Sentiment Gauge: High mention volume can indicate strong community sentiment, positive or negative. Identifying Potential Movers: Tokens appearing high on both lists, or showing a significant jump in search/mentions, might be worth researching further. Regional Nuances: This data highlights tokens with potentially stronger interest in the Korean market compared to global averages. Starting Point for Research: If a token you weren’t tracking appears high on these lists, it’s a signal to investigate why. Remember, this data is a snapshot from one week and one platform. It’s a valuable piece of the puzzle, but should be combined with broader market analysis and fundamental research. Conclusion: A Window into Korean Crypto Sentiment The Bitcoin World data for May 23-29 offers a fascinating look into the minds of the Korean crypto community . XRP’s dominance in searches, the consistent focus on BTC and ETH in discussions, and the emergence of specific altcoins and meme tokens paint a picture of a dynamic and engaged market. By tracking what this influential community is searching for and discussing, investors can gain valuable insights into potential trends and sentiment shifts. Staying informed about regional dynamics like these is crucial in the fast-paced world of crypto.

2025-06-02T19:12:18,"CertiK Says $302M Lost to Web3 Scams, Hacks, and Exploits in May","Blockchain security firm CertiK has released its May 2025 Security Report, revealing that over $302 million was lost across Web3 through scams, hacks, and exploits. While the overall losses marked a 16.94% decrease from April’s $364 million, one attack vector—code vulnerability—saw a dramatic surge. In May alone, $229.6 million was lost due to flawed code, a 4,483% increase from April’s $5 million. This vulnerability category became the top incident loss contributor, accounting for the majority of stolen funds. #CertiKStatsAlert Combining all the incidents in May we’ve confirmed ~$140.1M lost to exploits, hacks and scams after ~$162m was frozen. ~$8.5M of the total is attributed to phishing. More details below pic.twitter.com/LTE6axKeGi — CertiK Alert (@CertiKAlert) June 2, 2025 CertiK Senior Blockchain Security Researcher Natalie Newson emphasized the gravity of this spike, noting that although losses from code vulnerabilities had been declining in recent years, from $1.35 billion in 2021 to $173 million in 2024, May’s figure shows an urgent need for heightened code auditing and formal verification processes. Newson stresses that the rise shows how even mature areas of the space must remain vigilant, employing both human and AI-driven security protocols. Phishing and DeFi-Related Incidents Dominate Web3 Phishing scams , which had accounted for a large portion of April’s losses, saw a steep drop. In May, phishing-related incidents totaled $47.6 million—an 85% decrease from April’s $337 million. Despite the decline, phishing remained the second-most costly attack vector after code vulnerabilities, followed by private key compromises ($11.6 million) and price manipulation attacks ($1 million). DeFi platforms remained the most-targeted sector, experiencing losses of over $241 million in May. This reflects a broader trend of DeFi being a prime target for hackers due to its open-source nature and large pools of capital. Social engineering scams accounted for $35.5 million in losses, while exchanges and wallet drainers lost $11.1 million and $8.5 million, respectively. Cetus Hack Among the Month’s Major Incidents Among the nine major incidents identified in May, the most devastating was the attack on Cetus, which resulted in $225.6 million in stolen assets. Other breaches included Cork Protocol ($11.9 million), BittoPro ($11.1 million), Mobius DAO ($2.1 million), and Demex Nitron ($950,599). CertiK’s latest report is a stark reminder of the persistent and evolving threats within the Web3 ecosystem. As attackers refine their strategies, so too must the security measures designed to defend against them. Hacks and Scams in April Due to Phishing and Social Engineering Phishing accounted for the lion’s share of April’s losses, approximately $337 million. The standout case was the theft from an elderly U.S. investor , where the attacker used highly advanced social engineering tactics to deceive the victim and gain access to their Bitcoin wallet. According to CertiK, this event marks a new wave of cybercrime, where criminals bypass code and blockchain infrastructure entirely, opting instead to exploit human behavior. Social engineering, a tactic that manipulates people into revealing confidential information, has become one of the most effective strategies for crypto criminals. These attacks are particularly insidious because they often appear legitimate, tricking even experienced investors.

2025-06-02T19:12:05,"Crypto Exec Compares Bitcoin To Gold, Sees Bullish June for BTC","Charles Edwards, founder of the Capriole Fund, believes Bitcoin (BTC) follows a pattern similar to gold’s price movement between 2009 and 2011. If the flagship crypto can hold above a key price level, June 2025 could bring a strong recovery. However, he warned that if Bitcoin fails to do so, the anticipated rally may be delayed. Industry Expert Compares Bitcoin to Gold In a recent report, Charles Edwards said that after gold passed its highest price in 2008, it dropped slightly but rose to even higher prices. This happened when the precious metal turned a past resistance level into support. Edward believes Bitcoin is now in a similar position. Bitcoin broke past its 2021 high of $73,884 and reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,980 in late May. However, since then, the digital coin has dropped by 6.39%. Edwards says that for Bitcoin to continue rising, it must turn the $106,047 level into strong support. According to CoinMarketCap data , Bitcoin is trading at $104,379 at the time of writing, down 0.39% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin’s Next Move Hinges on $106K Price Level Bitcoin’s recent drop below the key level of $106,047 has caused some concern among investors. The cryptocurrency closed below this level for two consecutive days, which Charles Edwards describes as a negative sign. He believes that for Bitcoin to recover, it must close above $106,047 and hold that level. The founder said turning a previous resistance level into support is usually a sign that the market is ready to rise. Without this change, Edwards warned that the decline could continue, and any new rally might be delayed. Meanwhile, Katalin Tischhauser from Sygnum noted that Bitcoin is entering a new phase of supply shock . She explained that this supply constraint could create conditions for Bitcoin’s price to rise in the coming months. This development happens simultaneously as big investors are buying more Bitcoin to hold it. This shows that institutions are still interested, even though the market has dropped recently. Bitcoin Set for Short-Term Rebound Amid Fed Uncertainty On the bright side, another crypto analyst, PropheticBTC, agrees with the bullish outlook. He expects the flagship crypto to rise to $110,000 soon. While Edwards focuses more on the medium-term trend, PropheticBTC is more optimistic about the short term. Nevertheless, both analysts believe a recovery is possible, especially if Bitcoin climbs above the $106,047 mark. Beyond technical charts and indicators, macroeconomic and regulatory developments could shake things up. The Federal Reserve Chairman, Jerome Powell, is scheduled to speak today, and rumors are spreading that President Donald Trump may fire him. Many say any major announcement from the Fed could affect financial markets, including Bitcoin .

2025-06-02T19:10:55,"Crucial: Korean Crypto Investors Say Policy Pledges Influence Their Presidential Vote","BitcoinWorld Crucial: Korean Crypto Investors Say Policy Pledges Influence Their Presidential Vote Are Korean crypto investors letting their digital asset holdings influence their political decisions? A recent survey suggests a significant number are doing just that, indicating that candidates’ stances on crypto policy are playing a notable role in how they cast their presidential vote . Understanding the Pulse of Korean Crypto Investors A comprehensive survey conducted by Bitcoin World and Cratos between May 27 and 30 offered valuable insights into the minds of 2,000 Korean crypto investors . This poll tracked weekly trends and sentiments within this specific demographic, shedding light not only on their market outlook but also on the political weight they place on cryptocurrency-related issues. What’s the Latest on Bitcoin Price Prediction? One key aspect of the survey focused on the immediate future of the market, specifically regarding Bitcoin price prediction . The sentiment showed a notable shift towards optimism: Increase or Significantly Jump: 51.9% of respondents expected Bitcoin’s value to rise this week, a significant jump from 37.6% the previous week. Stable Market: 33.9% predicted a stable market, slightly down from 35.8% last week. Decline or Sharp Drop: Only 14.2% anticipated a decline, a sharp decrease from 26.7% previously. This indicates a growing bullish sentiment among Korean crypto investors looking at short-term movements. Gauging the Overall Market Sentiment Beyond specific price predictions, the survey also captured the broader market sentiment among the respondents. The feelings were mixed, but leaned slightly away from fear: Neutral: 39.2% felt neutral about the overall market conditions. Optimism or Extreme Optimism: 34.7% expressed positive sentiment. Fear or Extreme Fear: 26.1% reported feeling fearful. While a large segment remained neutral, the split between optimism and fear highlights the inherent volatility and uncertainty still felt by investors, even amidst short-term bullishness on Bitcoin. Does Crypto Policy Really Influence the Presidential Vote? This is where the survey delivered its most compelling finding. Ahead of the South Korean presidential election on June 3, respondents were asked about the impact of candidates’ crypto policy pledges on their voting decisions. The results clearly demonstrate that for a significant portion of Korean crypto investors , these policies are not just a minor consideration: Influence Level Percentage of Respondents Affects vote to some extent 34.2% A significant factor 26.5% A minor influence 18.2% Play no role at all 11.1% Single most important factor 10.0% Combining the ‘significant factor’ and ‘single most important factor’ categories reveals that over a quarter (36.5%) of Korean crypto investors consider crypto policy a major determinant in their presidential vote . Including those for whom it has ‘some extent’ of influence brings the total to over 60%. Why is Crypto Policy Becoming a Key Election Issue? The survey results underscore a growing trend: cryptocurrencies and related regulations are transitioning from a niche financial topic to a relevant political issue. As the number of people invested in crypto grows, their collective voice and concerns regarding clear regulation, investor protection, and taxation become more impactful. Candidates who acknowledge and address these concerns through well-defined crypto policy proposals are likely to resonate more strongly with this voter base. Actionable Insights for Candidates and the Industry For political candidates, ignoring the crypto community’s concerns could mean alienating a significant voting bloc. Developing thoughtful and clear positions on crypto regulation, taxation, and innovation is becoming increasingly important. For the crypto industry in Korea, these findings highlight the need for continued engagement with policymakers and public education efforts to shape future regulations constructively. Conclusion: Crypto Investors Make Their Voices Heard The survey provides compelling evidence that Korean crypto investors are not just passive market participants; they are engaged citizens who consider digital asset policies when making their presidential vote . With shifting sentiments on Bitcoin price prediction and varying degrees of market sentiment , the community remains dynamic, but their political influence, tied directly to crypto policy , is becoming undeniable. This signals a future where cryptocurrency issues will likely remain a relevant topic in political discourse.

2025-06-02T19:07:06,"Meta Shareholders Overwhelmingly Reject Proposal to Consider Bitcoin Treasury Strategy","Meta (META) shareholders have overwhelmingly voted against a proposal to add bitcoin BTC to the company’s balance sheet, according to a May 28 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Just 3.92 million votes supported the measure, while nearly 5 billion were cast in opposition. The idea was put forward in January by Ethan Peck, a bitcoin advocate who works as the bitcoin director for the wealth management firm Strive. Peck’s proposal called for Meta to move a portion of its $72 billion in cash and cash equivalents into bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. He argued that the tech giant should treat bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, similar to a corporate war chest designed to weather monetary policy uncertainty. The campaign was not limited to Meta. Peck also targeted Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) with similar proposals, filed on behalf of the conservative think tank National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR). Microsoft shareholders recently voted against the plan. Amazon has not yet held a vote. Though Meta doesn’t hold crypto on its balance sheet, the company has dabbled in blockchain before. In 2019, it announced Libra, a global stablecoin project backed by a basket of fiat currencies. That effort collapsed in 2022 after regulatory backlash and internal struggles, rebranding briefly as Diem before being shut down. Meta’s broader crypto strategy remains unclear. While its metaverse ambitions prompted the 2021 rebrand from Facebook to Meta, the company has pulled back on that vision in recent months. Still, earlier this year, reports surfaced that Meta was exploring the use of stablecoins to manage payments across its family of apps.

2025-06-02T19:00:55,"Ethereum ETF Inflows Explode: US Spot ETH ETFs Attract $285.84M in Powerful Third Week","BitcoinWorld Ethereum ETF Inflows Explode: US Spot ETH ETFs Attract $285.84M in Powerful Third Week Hey crypto enthusiasts! Get ready for some exciting news from the world of institutional investment. The US Spot ETH ETFs are making waves, recently recording a significant surge in capital inflows. This isn’t just a one-off event; it marks the third consecutive week where these investment vehicles have attracted substantial funds, signaling growing interest from investors looking to gain exposure to Ethereum (ETH) through regulated channels. US Spot ETH ETFs: A Closer Look at Recent Inflows According to the latest data compiled by SoSoValue, the collective net inflow into US Spot Ethereum (ETH) Exchange-Traded Funds reached an impressive $285.84 million last week. This figure underscores a sustained positive trend, extending the streak of weekly gains to three. For those tracking the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, this continuous inflow into Ethereum -based products is a key indicator of market sentiment and increasing comfort levels among traditional finance players. What exactly are we talking about here? A US Spot ETH ETF is an investment fund traded on traditional stock exchanges that holds actual Ethereum as its underlying asset. This structure allows investors to invest in ETH without directly buying, holding, or managing the cryptocurrency themselves, navigating the complexities of wallets, private keys, and crypto exchanges. The approval and launch of these ETFs earlier this year were monumental steps for the crypto industry in the United States. Which Ethereum ETF Inflows Led the Pack? While the overall number is strong, the performance varies among the different funds available. Analyzing the individual fund flows gives us a clearer picture of where the capital is heading. Here’s a snapshot of the activity last week: BlackRock’s ETHA: This fund emerged as the undisputed leader, attracting a staggering $205.85 million in inflows. BlackRock’s entry into the crypto ETF space, following its success with Bitcoin ETFs, continues to demonstrate its significant influence and investor confidence. Grayscale’s ETHE: In contrast, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust, which converted into an ETF, experienced the largest outflow, shedding $4.62 million . Outflows from Grayscale’s products (both Bitcoin and Ethereum) have been a common theme since their conversion to ETFs, often attributed to investors moving from the higher-fee trust structure to potentially lower-fee ETF options, or simply taking profits. Other Funds: While BlackRock and Grayscale represent the extremes, other issuers like Fidelity, VanEck, and Ark 21Shares also have active US Spot ETH ETFs. Their combined performance contributed to the remaining net inflow, indicating broader participation beyond just the largest players. This distribution highlights a common pattern seen with the Bitcoin ETFs as well: significant capital gravitating towards offerings from major financial institutions like BlackRock, while older trust structures like Grayscale’s experience some degree of capital rotation. Understanding the Significance of ETH ETF Trends Why should we pay attention to these ETH ETF flow numbers? They offer valuable insights into several aspects of the market: Institutional Appetite: Consistent inflows suggest that large investment firms, hedge funds, and asset managers are increasingly comfortable allocating capital to Ethereum via regulated products. This institutional validation is crucial for the long-term growth and stability of the crypto market (Benefit). Increased Accessibility: ETFs make it easier for retail investors with traditional brokerage accounts to add ETH exposure to their portfolios without navigating the complexities of direct crypto ownership (Benefit). This expands the potential investor base significantly. Market Maturity: The successful launch and operation of these ETFs indicate a maturing market infrastructure capable of supporting crypto-based financial products within traditional frameworks. Potential Price Impact: While not a direct one-to-one correlation, sustained inflows into ETFs can absorb supply from the market, potentially contributing to upward price pressure on Ethereum itself (Benefit). Challenges Remain: Despite the positives, investors should remember that ETH ETFs are still subject to market volatility, regulatory changes, and potential tracking errors. Fees associated with ETFs can also be higher than holding ETH directly (Challenge). What’s Driving Current Crypto ETF Momentum? The positive momentum in US Spot ETH ETFs doesn’t happen in isolation. It’s influenced by several factors contributing to the broader Crypto ETF landscape: Successful Precedent Set by Bitcoin ETFs: The highly successful launch and performance of US Spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier in the year created a template and demonstrated strong market demand for crypto-backed ETFs. This likely paved the way and built confidence for Ethereum counterparts (Example). Ethereum’s Network Developments: Ongoing developments on the Ethereum network, such as the recent Dencun upgrade, improve its efficiency and scalability, potentially making it a more attractive asset for long-term investment. Evolving Regulatory Landscape: While still complex, steps towards clearer regulatory frameworks in some regions can increase investor confidence. Overall Market Sentiment: Broader positive sentiment in the cryptocurrency market often translates to increased interest across major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These factors collectively create an environment where investors, both large and small, are exploring avenues to participate in the crypto space, and ETFs offer a familiar and regulated pathway. Actionable Insights for Investors Watching ETH ETFs So, what can you take away from this news if you’re considering investing or are already involved in the crypto market? Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand the specifics of each ETH ETF, including its fees, structure, and the issuer’s reputation, before investing (Actionable Insight). Consider Your Investment Goals: Are you looking for long-term exposure or short-term trading opportunities? ETFs might suit different strategies than direct ETH ownership (Actionable Insight). Understand the Risks: Remember that investing in an ETH ETF carries the same underlying price risk as holding Ethereum itself. The crypto market is known for its volatility (Actionable Insight). Diversification: Consider how an ETH ETF fits into your overall investment portfolio and risk tolerance (Actionable Insight). The inflows are a positive sign, but they are just one piece of the puzzle when making investment decisions. In conclusion, the sustained inflows into US Spot ETH ETFs, highlighted by BlackRock’s strong performance and a third consecutive week of gains, signal growing institutional and potentially retail interest in gaining regulated exposure to Ethereum. While Grayscale’s outflows represent a different dynamic, the overall trend points towards increasing acceptance and integration of crypto assets into traditional finance. This is a significant development for the Ethereum ecosystem and the broader crypto market, suggesting continued momentum as these investment products become more established.

2025-06-02T18:47:58,"Bitwise CIO Lauds Ripple’s XRP Loyal Base, Says XRP Not Competing with Bitcoin","Cryptocurrency markets often fixate on rivalries. Bitcoin vs. Ethereum . Solana vs. Hyperliquid. But at a Las Vegas conference last month, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan argued that XRP simply isn’t in Bitcoin’s ring. His remarks spurred fresh debate on how digital assets carve out unique niches—and why communities may matter as much as technology. On a Saturday at 1 p.m. Eastern Time, an estimated 1,000 people packed into the XRP Las Vegas venue. Investor conferences rarely attract such numbers during early afternoon weekend slots. But attendees filled every seat. Phones and tablets recorded the scene. Name badges swung across chests. Enthusiasm radiated in the air. Source: Hougan X Hougan delivered his keynote before that crowd. He posted photos afterward, showing rows of attendees glued to presentations. “It’s rare to see this turnout at 1 p.m. on a Saturday,” he said. “That speaks volumes about where XRP stands today.” Divergent Roles: Bitcoin vs. XRP Industry veterans often frame Bitcoin and XRP as adversaries. Yet Hougan challenged this binary. He stressed that each coin serves a distinct market: Bitcoin : Widely referred to as “digital gold,” Bitcoin commands a market capitalization of roughly $2.07 trillion as of late May 2025. Investors value its scarcity and decentralized security. XRP : Built for cross-border settlements, XRP’s daily transaction volume often outpaces many altcoins. As of May 2025, daily XRP transfers exceeded $30 billion. (Source: On-chain data providers). Hougan pointed out that thriving in different realms allows both cryptos to grow without cannibalizing each other. He said, “Bitcoin is reserved for store-of-value. XRP is optimized for fast settlements. One does not eat the other’s lunch.” XRP’s community has remained vocal and active, from developers to retail holders. Hougan praised this network as “the vital pillar of any crypto project.” He highlighted several facts: Developer Activity : Over 200 GitHub repositories related to XRP utilities and integrations remain active. Social Engagement : On platforms like X (Twitter) and Discord, XRP-specific channels host thousands of daily posts promoting real-world use cases—everything from remittance solutions to U.S. digital asset stockpile initiatives. This zeal once proved decisive in Ripple’s legal battle . In 2023, Judge Analisa Torres of the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York referenced affidavits from XRP holders compiled by attorney John Deaton. Those affidavits helped establish that Ripple’s programmatic token sales did not qualify as securities. After that ruling, major U.S. exchanges—including Kraken and Coinbase—re-listed XRP for trading. Both platforms cited renewed regulatory clarity as the driving factor. Ripple’s 2023 courtroom victory marked a turning point. Although Ripple still faces additional compliance hurdles, the decision lifted a cloud hanging over XRP’s trading status. Hougan underlined that community-driven legal support underscored XRP’s resilience. He added, “When holders step up, regulators and judges take note.” Since re-listing, XRP’s 24-hour trading volume has averaged $4 billion, a 35% increase from pre-ruling levels. Price volatility also declined. The token’s 30-day realized volatility dropped from 85% in June 2023 to 60% by March 2025. ETF Outlook Remains Bright In October 2024, Bitwise became the first asset manager to file a U.S. SEC application for an XRP spot ETF, signaling a growing institutional appetite for the asset class. Hougan has remained buoyant on the idea ever since. On live television in early 2025, he noted “strong demand” for an XRP ETF. As of June 2025, the SEC has yet to approve any spot XRP ETF . But industry insiders remain optimistic. Several proposals are in limbo, awaiting the regulator’s next steps. Hougan predicts a launch “later this year,” assuming no new regulatory setbacks. For comparison, the SEC approved the first Bitcoin spot ETF in January 2025, attracting $3.2 billion in assets within two weeks. Given the token’s utility-driven narrative and mobilized community, observers believe an XRP equivalent could draw $1 billion to $2 billion in its first month. With Bitwise’s XRP ETF filing still pending, market watchers will track SEC rulings closely. For now, XRP’s community is a testament to what organized advocacy can achieve. As Hougan put it, “Communities win hearts, minds, and sometimes, court cases.”",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitwise-cio-lauds-ripples-xrp-loyal-base-says-xrp-not-competing-with-bitcoin/,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare

2025-06-02T18:45:04,"Payments Giant Stripe Says Banks ‘Very Interested’ in Potentially Using Stablecoins: Report","The payment processing firm Stripe reportedly held early talks with banks regarding the potential for the financial firms to begin using stablecoin technology. Stablecoins are digital tokens designed to maintain a constant value against a fiat currency such as the US dollar. To date, there are about $243 billion worth of these assets in circulation, and c iting a statement from Stripe co-founder and president John Collison, Bloomberg reports that banks are eager to engage with stablecoins. Says Collison in an interview, “In the conversations we have with them, they’re very interested. This is not something that banks are just kind of brushing away or treating as a fad. Banks are very interested in how they should be integrated with stablecoins into their product offerings as well.” Collision says the talks happened after Stripe rolled out several stablecoin-related products in recent months, including a platform that gives fintechs the ability to quickly start their own stablecoin-card programs for customers. Last month, Stripe also announced that it is developing its stablecoin , which will be powered by the stablecoin infrastructure startup Bridge, a firm acquired by the payments giant last year. Stripe Crypto product manager Jennifer Lee says the company is ready to start testing the asset and invites companies outside the US, EU and the UK to reach out if they are interested in dollar access.

In a new interview with FOX Business, Dimon says that one of the biggest economic problems facing America is its increasing national debt, and that the government needs to tackle it. “[The US debt level is] a big deal. It is a real problem, but one day the bond market’s going to have a tough time. I don’t know if it’s six months or six years. I think we have to focus on it. But when you say focus on it, the real focus should be growth, pro-business, proper deregulation, permitting reform, getting rid of blue tape, getting skills in schools, get that growth going. That’s the best way. And then reform some of these programs everyone knows could be reformed properly. And I think some of the reform could take place. We’re not taking benefits out of poor people or sick people, old people. You’re just putting rules in place that make it more reasonable, less fraud, less waste, less abuse. I think all those things need to be done, and then we can conquer that problem.” Commenting on the weak US bond market, Dimon warns that if the country’s economy weakens due to its debt and other factors, investors may continue to flee US dollar assets, causing more bond market turmoil. The CEO doesn’t give a timeline, but says “it will happen.” “What the public has understand is that something like $30 trillion of securities trades every day. These are investors around the world. Foreigners own $35 trillion of American securities. They have another $30 trillion private investments in the United States, or something like that in the United States. People vote with their feet, and they’re going to be looking at the country, the rule of law, the inflation rates, the central bank policies, what they want to hedge and what they don’t want to hedge. Those [bond] rates aren’t set by central banks. They can affect them. They can twist them. They can do things to make you feel more comfortable, which they should do. But if people decide that the US dollar is not the place to be you could see credit spreads gap out and that would be quite a problem. We had that during COVID. The Fed properly stepped in then… It will happen again. I can almost guarantee that I just know exactly when or what the trigger might be.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The move follows a $1 million investment in Bitcoin ( BTC ) made by NewGen in December 2024. This latest decision marks a significant increase in its digital asset exposure. The company said the $30 million investment will be financed through existing credit lines with ATW and White Lion. Solana ( SOL ), renowned for its high-speed transactions and expanding decentralized app ecosystem, enables token holders to earn staking rewards while supporting the network’s operations. CEO Siu Wing Fung Alfred described the investment as a “natural evolution” of the firm’s digital asset strategy and a way to diversify NewGen’s portfolio.

According to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing , Strategy said on Monday that it had purchased $75 million worth of Bitcoin in cash between May 26 and June 1 at an average price of $106,495 per Bitcoin. Strategy now holds a total of 580,955 BTC — worth over $60 billion — bought at an average price of $70,023 per Bitcoin for a total cost of around $40.7 billion, including fees and expenses, according to the company’s co-founder and executive chairman, Michael Saylor. For context, that’s roughly 2.9% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply — fortifying its standing as the world’s biggest corporate holder of Bitcoin. Strategy has acquired 705 BTC for ~$75.1 million at ~$106,495 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 16.9% YTD 2025.

2025-06-02T18:29:59,"Elon Musk Announces Launch Of XChat — But Tech Experts Question Its Supposed ‘Bitcoin-Style’ Encryption","Eccentric tech billionaire Elon Musk, the owner of the X (formerly Twitter) social media platform, announced on Sunday the launch of a brand-new messaging feature called XChat. The feature touts capabilities such as encrypted conversations, vanishing messages, file transfers, and audio and video calls. However, Musk’s statement that XChat is built on a programming language called Rust with Bitcoin-style encryption confounded Bitcoiners. The comment sparked a flurry of replies from Bitcoin enthusiasts and cryptography experts, who expressed doubts about what exactly it meant. Experts Are Skeptical Of “Bitcoin-Style” Encryption JAN3 and Pixelmatic CEO Samson Mow noted that “Bitcoin isn’t encrypted,” while Bitcoin core developer Luke Dashjr also chimed in, stating “Bitcoin doesn’t even use encryption” and that using the Rust language was “a bad idea for security reasons.” Bitcoin employs elliptic curve cryptography and SHA-256 hashing for transaction validation and key generation. However, transactions conducted on the Bitcoin blockchain are not encrypted but are signed. Everything you do is broadcast publicly on the blockchain, as all data shared between Bitcoin nodes is unencrypted. “Seriously, what is Bitcoin-style encryption? Bitcoin primarily uses signatures, not encryption,” Ian Miers, Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Maryland, said on X . “This is like saying, we decided to run our rocket on water, since NASA uses Hydrogen and Oxygen. Musk’s announcement follows a week of revived interest in his various firms after he confirmed his exit from the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.). DOGE, named in part as a nod to Musk’s favored crypto Dogecoin, was created to reduce federal waste. Bitcoin, the industry’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, traded lower near $104,159 at publication time, having declined by over 5% over the past week, CoinGecko data shows . “Needless to say, “Bitcoin style” and “Rust” are not descriptions of an encryption scheme, nor are they strong indicators of security for a messaging app. Also, unless encrypted DMs are only in app, odds are they aren’t just in Rust,” Miers concluded . It’s worth mentioning that Musk’s EV maker Tesla purchased $1.5 billion worth of BTC in February 2021, calling it a reserve-management strategy. Although the company offloaded the majority of its holdings in Q2 2022, it still holds approximately 11,900 BTC on its balance sheet.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/elon-musk-announces-launch-of-xchat-but-tech-experts-question-its-supposed-bitcoin-style-encryption/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|MINING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Elon Musk",cryptocompare
2025-06-02T18:18:29,"Best crypto to buy as start of altcoin season favours low cap coins","Altcoin season has officially arrived, sparking fresh excitement across the crypto markets as both large and low-cap tokens begin to rally. The momentum has been building gradually, but over the last few days, key indicators have confirmed that the altcoin market is entering a bullish phase. Monero (XMR), Maker (MKR), and Sonic (S) are among the large-cap altcoins that have taken the lead, showing strong price performances and growing investor interest. Low-cap altcoins are the biggest gainers While these top-tier coins are gaining traction, the most dramatic surges are occurring in the low-cap segment, where returns can be significantly higher for early entrants. Build on BNB (BOB), WEMIX, Layer 3 (L3), and Maple Finance (SYRUP) have emerged as some of the biggest gainers as trading volumes and percentage gains skyrocket. BOB has jumped over 266% in just 24 hours, attracting fresh eyes to the BNB ecosystem and proving that even niche tokens can lead the way during altcoin rallies. WEMIX is following closely, climbing nearly 59% as trading activity surged, supported by growing interest in its gaming and NFT infrastructure. Layer 3, known for its Web3 integration tools, also delivered a solid 34.3% gain, while SYRUP added to the trend with a 15.8% rise, signalling that decentralised finance (DeFi) remains a key narrative. Today’s top gainers |Source: Coingecko The rise of these low-cap altcoins often signals the start of a more aggressive alt season, where traders rotate profits from Bitcoin and Ethereum into riskier, high-reward tokens. Which is the best crypto to buy as the altcoin season starts? For new investors entering the market, this moment presents a strategic opportunity to discover emerging coins before they receive mainstream attention. The environment is particularly favourable for upcoming projects like Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP), which is currently finalising its presale and preparing for its first exchange listing. Earlier today, the Bitcoin Pepe team announced that its listing date has been pushed to June 17, giving investors a short but crucial window to accumulate tokens at the presale price. Bitcoin Pepe @BitcoinPepe_ · Follow Presale AnnouncementWe’ve been working closely with exchanges, but as these things go, they need a bit more time to finalise. Therefore, our listing announcement is now set for June 17th, with more info coming 🗓️To thank our early supporters, we’re giving a 30% bonus to 6:00 PM · Jun 2, 2025 48 Reply Copy link Read 14 replies To reward early adopters, the project is now offering a 30% bonus to everyone who has already participated in the presale, further strengthening confidence and demand. Notably, Bitcoin Pepe positions itself as the world’s first meme-based Bitcoin Layer-2 project, aiming to bring Solana-like speed and cost-efficiency to the Bitcoin ecosystem. It introduces a new PEP-20 token standard, allowing memecoins to launch on Bitcoin, a concept that merges the power of BTC with the viral potential of meme culture. This innovative narrative has already attracted massive interest, with the presale raising over $13.6 million out of a $14.08 million target. With the final tokens now selling at $0.0396, and just 15 days left before the CEX and DEX listings go live, momentum is building fast. Bitcoin Pepe’s unique approach to combining Bitcoin’s longevity with the explosiveness of memes has resonated with both retail traders and influencers across the Web3 space. In addition, the team behind BPEP includes crypto veterans like Tafcir, formerly of Ubisoft’s Web3 division, and Allan, a seasoned community builder with deep roots in decentralised culture. As the altcoin season unfolds, Bitcoin Pepe’s timing couldn’t be better, placing it in a position to benefit from renewed interest in novel, early-stage crypto assets. Presale buyers could not only lock in lower prices but also receive bonus allocations, putting them in an advantageous position before potential listing surges. For investors looking to enter the market during altcoin season, BPEP offers both narrative appeal and practical utility, making it more than just another meme token. Moreover, the project’s roadmap includes a Layer-2 bridge, a native DEX, and community staking, providing strong foundations for long-term value. Given the market’s shift toward high-upside, low-cap assets, Bitcoin Pepe stands out as a compelling option ahead of its anticipated public debut.

2025-06-02T18:03:06,"Is the crypto bull run still alive? A Bitcoin price technical analysis deep dive","Bitcoin’s recent pullback has sparked debate: is the bullish trend still intact, or is a deeper correction on the horizon? With price currently trading above a key channel low and the 200-day moving average, this zone may represent the foundation for the next leg higher—toward $116,000. After tapping a new all-time high around $111,900, Bitcoin ( BTC ) entered a corrective phase, pulling back toward high-timeframe support at $104,300. This zone marks the bottom boundary of the bullish channel that has contained price action for months. Rejections from the channel high often lead to retests of the channel low, which is precisely what has occurred. Price is now hovering just above the 200-day moving average, a level closely watched by institutional traders and a historically reliable marker of macro support. Key technical points Channel Low Support at $104,300 : Acts as the structural base for the current bullish trend; holding this level is crucial for any continuation to the upside. 200-Day Moving Average: Bitcoin is currently trading above this dynamic support, reinforcing bullish bias if it continues to hold. Trendline Resistance Above: A descending trendline acts as minor resistance. Breaking this would signify a structural shift and the start of a new bullish leg. Bullish Market Structure Since $74,000: Price continues to print higher highs and higher lows. As long as this pattern holds, the trend remains intact. “Power of Three” Accumulation Structure: Price appears to be forming an accumulation-manipulation-distribution phase. Reclaiming the channel confirms the bullish reversal. Failed Auction Possibility: If price reclaims the channel after manipulation, a failed auction scenario is confirmed, greatly increasing the odds of a move to $116,000. BTCUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView From a market context perspective, the rejection from the channel high and subsequent retracement toward the channel low are technically expected. Price inside a well-defined channel often oscillates between its boundaries before breaking in the dominant direction. The rejection at $111,900 aligned with the channel’s resistance, while the current stalling at $104,300 has already produced a strong bullish candle, signaling that buyers are defending this level. This type of impulsive bounce from support suggests a short-term sentiment shift. Structurally, Bitcoin is trading back within its established bullish channel, implying the previous breakout may have been an early expansion or overextension. The current retest can be seen as a healthy reset before continuation. You might also like: Crypto Fight Night ONCHAIN ignites the ring at Philippine Blockchain Week 2025 Of particular importance is the 200-day moving average now sitting just below the price. Historically, this level has acted as long-term support during major bull trends. A close and consolidation above it typically signals that the broader uptrend remains in place. As long as BTC holds this level, it projects long-term strength. BTCUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView Beyond surface-level technicals, there is growing interest in a possible “Power of Three” pattern. This accumulation framework includes three phases: Accumulation – where price consolidates in a range Manipulation – where price breaks below key support, shaking out weak hands Distribution – a powerful rally following the fakeout In this context, the drop below the channel low may represent manipulation. A reclaim of the channel would confirm a failed auction, a classic deviation followed by strong continuation. If this pattern holds, the move to $116,000 could unfold rapidly, aligning with Fibonacci extensions and the measured move from the channel range. BTCUSDT (6H) Chart, Source: TradingView Bitcoin’s broader structure remains technically bullish. Since forming a major swing low at $74,000, the asset has consistently printed higher highs and higher lows. The current correction fits within that structure and could represent a new higher low. Only a clean break below $104,300 on high volume would challenge this thesis. You might also like: Blockchain firm BTCS Inc. buys 1,000 ETH via Crypto.com Volume remains telling. While it spiked during the drop, it has stayed elevated during the defense of $104,300, evidence that demand is present at support. Sustained buying pressure at this level could set the stage for the next upward rotation. What to expect in the coming price action As long as Bitcoin holds above $104,300 and remains above the 200-day moving average, the bullish market structure is intact. A reclaim of the channel followed by a break of trendline resistance would confirm the next bullish phase. Expect a rotation toward $111,900, followed by a measured extension toward $116,000. If this plays out, Bitcoin would validate the Power of Three structure and confirm that the recent breakdown was a deviation, fueling a failed auction rally toward new highs.

Click here to find out more » By Sholanke Dele Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) began Monday’s European session by staging a mild rebound at $105,500, after last week’s 5.5% drop from $109,000 to $103,200. That retracement pulled the price below the 0.786 Fibonacci level of the rally that ended at the all-time high of $112,000, signalling profit-taking into month-end. Despite the late-May weakness, Bitcoin still closed the month with an 11% gain, building on April’s 14% rise. That two-month strength suggests the broader bullish structure is still valid, but recent developments now place heavy emphasis on reclaiming critical resistance zones to sustain upward momentum. BTC price dynamics (April - May 2025). Source: TradingView The price rebounded from $103,200 over the weekend, reclaiming the 0.786 Fibonacci level. But today’s Asian session selloff found resistance near $105,800, a level that coincides with both the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, commonly known as the golden ratio, and the 100 EMA on the 4-hour chart. This confluence marks the most immediate barrier for bulls. Bitcoin rally depends on clearing $106,000 and invalidating the EMA death cross As the European session opens, Bitcoin attempts another retest of this resistance zone. But the upside remains constrained by the bearish crossover structure on the 4-hour chart, where the 20 EMA crossed below both the 50 and 100 EMA following last week’s slide. Although the 20 EMA has been reclaimed at $105,350, the 50 EMA at $106,000 is the next hurdle before further upside can be considered. Momentum also reflects indecision. The RSI holds around 50, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. This supports the idea of a key inflection point, where the next move will depend on whether price breaks above the golden ratio or slips back toward support. If bulls fail to reclaim the $106,000 to $107,000 resistance band, downside could revisit the previous week’s low at $103,200.

2025-06-02T17:53:57,"Crypto prices today: Bitcoin at risk below $104K, XMR, KAIA lead daily gains","Bitcoin extended its downtrend from May 27, with bulls attempting to hold the line at the critical $104,000 support level, a threshold analysts view as pivotal in averting a deeper market correction. With risk appetite fading, the total crypto market cap dropped by over 2 percent to $3.36 trillion, revisiting early May levels. The sentiment shift was reflected in the Crypto Fear and Greed Index, which dropped to 56, signaling a move from greed to a more cautious, neutral stance. Altcoins traded largely flat, showing limited momentum as Bitcoin dominance continued to weigh on broader market activity. While a few names posted modest gains, the majority hovered near previous levels or recorded slight declines. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin’s latest drop comes amid growing macroeconomic concerns, most notably stalled trade negotiations between the United States and China. The breakdown in talks has reignited global risk aversion, prompting investors to shift away from speculative assets, such as cryptocurrencies. Geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe added to the cautious mood, as renewed concerns over the Russia-Ukraine conflict resurfaced in market discussions. Bitcoin slipped below $104,000 at the June 2 Wall Street open, coinciding with broader market unease around the potential collapse of ongoing peace efforts. Analysts at the Kobeissi Letter noted that markets were effectively pricing out expectations of a resolution, following months of behind-the-scenes diplomacy. While former President Donald Trump had reportedly been working on a peace framework, the lack of formal communication from US officials has fueled speculation and uncertainty over the conflict’s trajectory. This risk-off sentiment was reflected in the derivatives market, where over $156 million in crypto futures positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours. According to Coinglass data, 73,552 traders were wiped out during the sell-off, with long positions accounting for the bulk of the damage at $76.39 million. Bitcoin and Ethereum bore the brunt of the derivatives washout, with ETH alone seeing $3.08 million in long liquidations. The imbalance between long and short liquidations suggests that traders were overly optimistic on a rebound, only to be caught off guard by the sharp downside move. Adding further pressure, institutional flows have also turned negative. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded back-to-back outflows over the past two trading sessions, with a combined drawdown of nearly $975 million. This ended a 10-day streak of inflows, raising concerns over waning institutional conviction at current price levels. With sentiment retreating and both derivatives and spot flows turning bearish, the market appears to be entering a consolidation phase. Will Bitcoin crash? Most analysts are not calling for an outright crash, but rather expect Bitcoin to enter a consolidation phase as it digests recent volatility. Trading firm QCP Capital noted that despite the recent swings, Bitcoin is still holding above 102,000 dollars, pointing to underlying support in that range. According to their latest market bulletin, volatility has compressed and risk reversals are stabilising, which often suggests quieter price action ahead. In the absence of fresh catalysts, QCP expects Bitcoin to trade within a broad range of 100,000 to 110,000 dollars over the near term. Others like Daan Crypto Trades are watching short-term patterns closely. Based on prior monthly trends, the trader believes early June moves may fade once a local reversal forms. If that scenario plays out, it could guide trading direction for the rest of the month, although the broader trend remains unclear. Daan Crypto Trades @DaanCrypto · Follow $BTC My plan for the month ahead 👇ith eyes on this strong monthly statistic, I am looking for either of these two scenarios. Drawings are a rough estimate, obviously the moves can go lower or higher, it’s more about the idea than the precise levels for now.I think there’s a 1:32 AM · Jun 2, 2025 346 Reply Copy link Read 74 replies Historical data also adds some caution. June has been a bearish month for Bitcoin in four of the past six years, and as such, seasonal weakness could persist if macro pressures stay in focus. Traders are also watching key economic data from the US this week, particularly unemployment figures and any signals from the Federal Reserve. All eyes will be on Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s opening remarks due later today. The strength of the labour market is being reassessed after recent data hinted at softening, raising questions about the Fed’s ability to keep rates elevated. Although inflation appears to be cooling, as seen in the latest PCE print, the Fed has so far held firm. President Trump’s recent meeting with Powell didn’t move market expectations either, with CME FedWatch data showing traders still do not anticipate a rate cut before September. That said, some analysts see a potential tailwind for Bitcoin in the weakening US dollar. The Dollar Index has dropped back below 99, reversing its earlier gains. According to experts at Mosaic Asset Management, if dollar weakness deepens, it could signal broader concerns over the US fiscal outlook, a setup that could benefit assets like gold and Bitcoin over the longer term. At the moment, some Bitcoin technicals point to a deeper correction. The cryptocurrency has broken below the lower boundary of a bear flag pattern at 104,800 dollars on the four-hour chart, confirming a bearish continuation setup. This breakdown opens the door to a potential move toward the pattern’s projected target of 97,690 dollars. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView. Supporting the bearish case, BTC’s Relative Strength Index remains weak, with the RSI hovering around 44. This suggests that selling pressure is still dominant, leaving Bitcoin vulnerable to further downside unless a strong reversal catalyst emerges. Nevertheless, not all market watchers are leaning bearish, with some viewing the latest pullback as a necessary reset within a broader uptrend. According to Merlijn The Trader, a golden cross has recently formed on Bitcoin’s daily chart, mirroring a similar setup seen late last year. At the time, a 10 percent correction was followed by a sharp 63 percent rally. If that pattern repeats, Merlijn suggests Bitcoin could be primed for a breakout move exceeding 60 percent in the coming weeks.

Criminals are using delivery trucks to access secure areas without being challenged. High-value crypto holders face rising physical extortion risks globally. On May 31, Paris prosecutors charged 25 suspects in a string of crypto-linked abductions, including a foiled kidnapping attempt targeting Paymium CEO Pierre Noizat’s family. The cases, marked by severed fingers and €7M ransom demands, reveal a brutal new front in crypto crime. At least three high-profile abduction plots have been disrupted since May, all targeting French crypto executives or their relatives. Prosecutors warn that the tactics, which include physical mutilation, reflect an escalating threat to digital asset holders. NEW: France Charges 25 Suspects in Connection to Crypto Abduction Cases According to the report, the suspects are all ages 16-23, including 6 minors charged. More than three firms specializing in crypto insurance and security are now preparing tailored kidnaps. pic.twitter.com/ykWrEo1fmg — Crypto Trends (@Crypto_Trends_) June 1, 2025 How Delivery Van Disguises Are Fueling Crypto Kidnappings According to a local media report , the charges are linked to an attempted abduction that took place on May 13. In a bold daylight attack near a school, the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the CEO of crypto firm Paymium, were nearly kidnapped by assailants posing as delivery drivers. The attackers used a van marked with the branding of French courier delivery service Chronopost to blend in. The attempt failed due to the intervention of a bystander and the victim’s companion. @Valeurs | Ce mardi matin, deux personnes proches de l'univers de la cryptomonnaie ont fait l’objet d’une tentative d’enlèvement en plein Paris.

Prosecutors also pointed to other failed crypto kidnapping plots, including a prior attempt on the same targets the day before. This also included a disrupted scheme near Nantes just last week. So far, 18 suspects have been placed in pre-trial detention. Three have requested to delay their court hearings, and four others are under judicial supervision, which requires them to follow strict rules while awaiting trial. France has witnessed a disturbing rise in such incidents, and recent headlines reflect the scope of the problem. On May 1, the father of a young online poker player, who had earned millions through crypto trading and live streaming, was kidnapped in Paris’s 14th arrondissement. Four attackers disguised as UPS delivery workers used a stolen van to abduct the victim. A ransom of €5–€7 million was demanded via wire transfer. To coerce the son into transferring the requested sum, they severed one of the victim’s fingers and recorded the act. The victim was later rescued in Palaiseau during a coordinated police operation. Another similar case was reported in January. David Balland, co-founder of the crypto hardware company Ledger, and his wife were kidnapped in the Cher region of France. The attackers reportedly severed one of Balland’s fingers and recorded the brutal act. They then sent the video to his business partner, Eric Larchevêque, along with a ransom demand. According to Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau, the kidnappers requested payment in cryptocurrency and managed to collect part of the ransom.

They are now part of a growing criminal playbook targeting high-profile figures in the digital finance sector. As crypto assets gain value and visibility, so does the risk for those who own them. Global Hotspots Where Crypto Kidnappings Are Surging France may be in the spotlight, but it’s far from the only country facing this trend. Crypto kidnappings are on the rise worldwide. From South America to North America, Europe to Asia, criminals target digital asset holders with alarming boldness. In the U.S., two NYPD officers were placed on modified duty last week . Investigators are examining their possible involvement in a crypto kidnapping case involving an Italian national in Manhattan.

Meanwhile, the U.S. charged six men in February linked to the October 2024 kidnapping of four Chicago residents. The victims were forced to transfer $15 million in crypto . Just a month before that, a UK court sentenced seven gang members to lengthy prison terms for kidnapping and torturing a crypto investor . The operation was an attempt to extort digital assets. One of the most high-profile cases in Canada involved WonderFi CEO Dean Skurka. He was kidnapped during rush hour in Toronto in November 2024 and released after reportedly paying a $1 million ransom . Crypto abductions have cracked the safety net of digital finance. They show that the risks of holding valuable digital assets extend beyond phishing emails and password theft. They can reach into homes and families, threatening personal safety. Governments are intensifying their fight through cross-border investigations, tighter regulations, and advanced technology tracking. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How are criminals identifying crypto targets? Some scour social media for targets. Others leverage data from hacked cryptocurrency exchanges, such as the latest Coinbase data dump on the darknet. Why aren’t crypto abductions prosecuted as terrorism? These kidnappers aren’t political. They’re part of profit-driven crime rings, hunting crypto wealth through brutal but businesslike schemes.

2025-06-02T17:43:29,"Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson Talks About Bitcoin (BTC), ADA, and XRP! Outlines His Plans!","Cardano (ADA), one of the largest altcoins in the cryptocurrency market, experienced a major attack after Donald Trump's presidential victory. While ADA continues to make a name for itself with its 100 percent rise, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson made a bold prediction for Bitcoin (BTC). Hoskinson predicted at the recent Bitcoin Conference that Bitcoin could reach somewhere between $250,000 and $500,000 in the coming years. Hoskinson also shared Cardano’s latest expectations for the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, including plans to integrate XRP into its growing ecosystem. Noting that Bitcoin is a store of value from the strength of DeFi, he said the shift towards BTC is accelerating. Reiterating three long-standing and defining principles for Bitcoin, Hoskinson listed them as “all transactions must use only Bitcoin, fees must be paid in BTC, and returns must come only from Bitcoin.” Hoskinson said that these rules help protect Bitcoin’s identity but make DeFi integration extremely difficult, and that’s where Cardano comes in. At this point, Hoskinson stated that they have developed the technology to enable DeFi integration and connect BTC and DeFi without changing the essence and identity of Bitcoin. Charles Hoskinson also confirmed that Cardano is working to incorporate XRP into the DeFi ecosystem and wants to leverage XRP’s strong reputation for cross-border payments. Finally, Hoskinson added that this integration could help create a seamless, scalable multi-chain ecosystem where Bitcoin, XRP, and Cardano can work together, increasing financial access and inclusivity around the world. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-02T17:43:19,"Bitwise CIO Speaks Highly of This Altcoin! Reveals the Secret of Its Success!","New statements came from Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, who stands out with his strong predictions about Bitcoin (BTC) and the cryptocurrency market. This time he talked about one of the largest altcoins, Ripple – XRP. On this point, Matt Hougan recently praised XRP and emphasized the strength of its community. Hougan stated that he believes XRP’s success can primarily be attributed to the strength of the community behind it. According to Hougan, who stated that he gave a keynote speech at the XRP Las Vegas event from his X account, the conference venue was filled with 1,000 people at 1:00 pm ET on Saturday. That number was impressive, according to Hougan, as early Saturday afternoon events tend to draw fewer people, but the XRP community showed its strength and filled the venue. The Bitwise CIO was asked about the key takeaways from the conference, to which Hougan responded by comparing Bitcoin and XRP. At this point, the Bitwise CIO stated that the XRP community is increasingly accepting that Bitcoin and XRP are not direct competitors, and that both XRP and Bitcoin serve different markets. “I think the XRP world has embraced the idea that BTC and XRP serve different markets and that BTC’s development will not disrupt XRP’s goals. But mostly, it's just the power of the community. That's a huge piece of success in crypto, and the community in XRP is strong.” Bitwise CIO previously predicted that if XRP manages to gain a significant foothold in sectors like payments and tokenization, its price could rise to around $30 after a decade. *This is not investment advice.

Meanwhile, a small leveraged ETF tied to the stock, Defiance Daily Target 2x Short MSTR ETF (SMST), has plummeted to a record low of $29, marking an 82% decline from its January levels. The ETF holds over $42 million in assets. SMST vs MSTR vs Bitcoin | Source: SeekingAlpha This sharp underperformance is due to SMST’s design: it seeks -2x the daily percentage change of Strategy stock (MSTR). In other words, it is structured to rise when Strategy stock falls—and to decline when the stock is in an uptrend. You might also like: Strategy stock price moves into a correction: will it rebound? For example, on Monday, June 2, MSTR stock rose 1.30%, while SMST dropped 2.50%. Other leveraged MSTR ETFs have also lagged behind its stock this year. The Defiance Daily Target 2x Long MSTR ETF has dropped by 4.5% while the T-Rex 2X Long MSTR Daily Target ETF has also dropped by 6.4% this year. These funds have struggled largely because Strategy stock has declined more than 12% from its highest level this year, despite remaining up year-to-date. Inverse leveraged ETFs like SMST are risky Historically, leveraged inverse ETFs underperform their benchmark assets. For example, the ProShares UltraPro Short QQQ ETF or SQQQ has crashed by 97% in the last five years. In contrast, the ProShares UltraPro QQQ or TQQQ has jumped by 242% in the same period. The SMST ETF will likely continue falling since analysts anticipate that Bitcoin ( BTC ) will do well in the long term. Ark Invest sees Bitcoin jumping to $2.4 million by 2030, while BlackRock expects that it will hit $700,000. If these estimates are correct, it means that Strategy stock will jump in the long term because the company holds almost 600,000 Bitcoins, a number that is increasing weekly. The other risk for SMST ETF is that it is highly expensive, with an expense ratio of 1.29%. In contrast, popular ETFs like the Vanguard S&P 500 and iShares S&P 500 charge just 0.03%. This means that a $10,000 invested in SMST will charge an annual fee of $129, while the S&P 500 funds charge just $3 a year.

2025-06-02T17:30:52,"Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse says Bitcoin is not the enemy","CEO of Ripple Labs, Brad Garlinghouse, surprised the entire XRP community and much of the wider crypto community when he said, “Bitcoin is not the enemy,” at the XRP Las Vegas 2025 conference. Many people did not expect Garlinghouse to support Bitcoin and its community because he strongly criticized its flaws for years. Because he changed his opinion, people are now questioning whether he is genuine or if his moves are just for political and industry support, especially now when cryptocurrency is under pressure from governments and traditional banks. While some believe he wants to unify the crypto world to push back against tight regulations and a banking system that still controls most global finance, others worry that he might be giving in to Bitcoin maximalists. Whatever the reason, Garlinghouse’s new message is bold, and it could reshape how people view Ripple and XRP in the larger crypto conversation. Ripple and Bitcoin communities have long clashed Ripple and Bitcoin supporters have disagreed on what makes a good cryptocurrency for over a decade. The XRP community has long said Bitcoin still depends on proof-of-work mining that consumes large amounts of electricity and handles fewer transactions per second, while their token solves real-world problems by being faster, more scalable, and far more energy-efficient. Garlinghouse described Bitcoin’s mining model as outdated and harmful to the environment, and he has repeatedly said XRP is better suited for building a real, usable financial system on the blockchain. On the other hand, Bitcoin maximalists claim XRP is centralized, controlled by Ripple Labs, and serves banks instead of empowering individuals. They call the token a “banker coin” and say it goes against the original vision of crypto, which was meant to remove middlemen, not work with them. Maxis also points to the long legal battle with the SEC as proof that XRP isn’t a trustworthy or decentralized cryptocurrency. Ripple’s peace gift to Bitcoin supporters stirs mixed reactions Brad Garlinghouse donated the Skull of Satoshi to the Bitcoin community days before the XRP Las Vegas 2025 conference began. Some people praised the move as a way of acknowledging past conflicts while signaling a new willingness to collaborate. At the same time, some Bitcoin maximalists saw it as a sign that Ripple and its supporters finally recognized Bitcoin’s dominance. Others said the peace offering showed that XRP needed Bitcoin more to succeed in cryptocurrency. In one post, a user said, “Ripple tried to replace Bitcoin for 10 years. Now they’re offering us skulls like it’s ancient Rome.” Another viral tweet said, “When you lose the war, at least bring a gift.” However, XRP loyalists had mixed reactions because some interpreted the move as a sign that Ripple was rising above petty arguments and positioning itself as a unifier in the industry. In contrast, others worried that the gesture made Ripple look weak. Garlinghouse makes a risky but strategic move Brad Garlinghouse’s new tone toward Bitcoin could be a carefully calculated strategy that allows him to build stronger alliances as the US government and financial regulators scrutinize digital assets. He may also want to prepare Ripple for upcoming discussions with financial institutions and governments that want to integrate blockchain technology on condition that they see signs of stability and professionalism. However, critics argue that Garlinghouse might be extending a hand that won’t be accepted, making his gestures look like weakness instead of strength. The biggest risk is within Ripple because the brand has always positioned XRP as an efficient, scalable, and low-cost alternative to Bitcoin, and its supporters stood proudly against what they saw as Bitcoin’s flaws. Garlinghouse’s latest message muddies the line between rival and partner, and a growing number of XRP fans feel like the company is gradually retreating from the principles that made it unique, which muddles and frustrates its base. Supporters who once believed XRP would overtake or replace Bitcoin may now wonder if the goal has changed and Ripple could lose its loyal following by trying to appeal to both sides.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/did-ripple-just-surrender-to-bitcoin-maxis/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MINING|REGULATION|XRP","OP-ED|Bitcoin|Ripple",cryptocompare
2025-06-02T17:30:16,"Bitcoin Vs. M2: Abra CEO Sees $130,000 As Liquidity Floods In","Bill Barhydt, the founder and chief executive of crypto-banking platform Abra, set Crypto-X alight over the weekend by reposting a collage of global M2-versus-Bitcoin charts first popularised by macro investor Raoul Pal and researcher Julien Bittel. “I’ve seen over a dozen posts with different versions of the global liquidity M2 vs Bitcoin price chart – I’ve attached several here. Credit @RaoulGMI and his colleague @BittelJulien for discovering the trend,” he wrote. “Most of these charts predict a dip over the coming days to around $100 k and then a move to new ATH of $130 k in August/September … Or this could all be horseshit. Whatever.” Will Bitcoin Follow M2? Expanding on the macro backdrop, Barhydt argued that “global liquidity needs to rise significantly in the coming months. Bitcoin remains the mother of all liquidity (re: debasement) sponges.” He framed the asset’s reflexivity in stark terms: as fiat supply grows, Bitcoin absorbs the monetary excess, and the resulting gains “will most likely spill over into other L1 platforms and then ultimately speculative alts – the proverbial alt season.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Tipped For $340,000 Target If This Support Level Holds – Details Even so, he cautioned traders against complacency. “Watch your leverage, touch grass and please please be civil,” Barhydt advised, noting that the anticipated pull-back could be a gentle pause or a swift capitulation toward $95,000 before any summer rally materialises. When a follower fretted that the model might already be overcrowded, Barhydt dismissed the idea that positioning had reached critical mass: “I’ve thought about that but we’re talking about trillions of dollars and billions of people. There might be thousands of people focused on this but not more. Even then retail writ large isn’t focused on crypto right now.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Warning: Bull Trap Or $270,000 Rocket? Analyst Exposes What’s Coming A second critic complained that the liquidity data “is not collected on a timeframe that would predict daily moves.” Barhydt concurred, replying: “I completely agree. Hence the ‘whatever’ reference. It’s macro directional on a weekly scale at best. But in that regard it’s been a very good tool.” The liquidity-first thesis still has heavyweight backers. Pal recently told Real Vision subscribers that “liquidity is the single most important driver of all asset prices,” estimating that rising world-money supply accounts for up to 90% of Bitcoin price action, while Bittel’s latest update pegs global M2 near a record $111 trillion – a level he says leaves Bitcoin “still going higher.” Whether those macro tailwinds propel Bitcoin to the $130,000 target or prove, in Barhydt’s own words, to be “horseshit” will depend on how briskly central banks resume balance-sheet expansion and how aggressively traders deploy leverage in the weeks ahead. For now, Barhydt’s call serves as both roadmap and reality check: the next swing could be explosive, but the model is only as good as the liquidity it tracks. At press time, BTC traded at $104,625.

2025-06-02T17:28:05,"Bitcoin Pepe announces new listing date and 30% bonus for early buyers","Bitcoin Pepe, the viral meme coin that’s been making waves in the crypto community, has officially announced a new centralized exchange (CEX) listing date: June 17, 2025. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the project’s official account stated that while they’ve been “working closely with exchanges,” the process has required “a bit more time to finalise.” To show appreciation for early adopters, Bitcoin Pepe is now offering a 30% bonus to all current holders who participated in the presale phase. Bitcoin Pepe @BitcoinPepe_ · Follow Presale AnnouncementWe’ve been working closely with exchanges, but as these things go, they need a bit more time to finalise. Therefore, our listing announcement is now set for June 17th, with more info coming 🗓️To thank our early supporters, we’re giving a 30% bonus to 8:00 PM · Jun 2, 2025 48 Reply Copy link Read 14 replies With the listing just two weeks away, excitement is building among investors who see the coin as one of 2025’s most promising meme tokens. The announcement follows a highly successful presale, during which Bitcoin Pepe raised over $13 million, signaling strong early investor confidence in the project’s potential. Why CEX Listings matter for Bitcoin Pepe A centralized exchange (CEX) listing is a major milestone for any crypto project, and for Bitcoin Pepe, it could be the spark that launches the coin into the mainstream. CEX listings provide increased liquidity, visibility, and accessibility, opening the door to a wider audience beyond the DeFi-savvy crowd. Most retail investors still rely on centralized platforms to purchase crypto, meaning that listing on a top-tier exchange could significantly boost trading volume and market awareness. The June 17 listing could mark the moment Bitcoin Pepe transitions from meme coin cult favorite to broader market contender. What makes Bitcoin Pepe an attractive pick for 2025 While meme coins are often associated with hype over substance, Bitcoin Pepe is trying to stand out by building a strong community and capitalizing on broader market tailwinds. Its branding, merging the internet’s beloved Pepe character with the gravitas of Bitcoin, has struck a chord with a new generation of crypto investors looking for high-upside plays with viral potential. Add to that the fact that the crypto market is heating up again. With the Federal Reserve expected to resume cutting interest rates in the second half of 2025, and Bitcoin itself pushing toward new highs after months of consolidation, the macro environment is turning bullish. If Bitcoin rallies, it tends to lift the entire market, and meme coins, often the most speculative of all assets, typically see explosive gains during these phases. What could drive future demand for Bitcoin Pepe Bitcoin Pepe isn’t just another meme coin – it’s the world’s only Bitcoin meme ICO, aiming to merge viral internet culture with serious blockchain innovation. The project is building Solana on Bitcoin, introducing a Meme Layer-2 that features instant transactions, ultra-low fees, and a new PEP-20 token standard to support scalable, fun applications on the Bitcoin network – all of which could further improve its demand and lead to a higher price target moving forward.

2025-06-02T17:25:15,"Why Bitcoin’s next short-term target is $120,000","Although Bitcoin ( BTC ) is consolidating, a trading expert projects that the asset is poised to break out toward $120,000. In this case, prominent online analyst TradingShot pointed out that Bitcoin nearly touched its four-hour 200-period moving average ( MA ) on Saturday, a critical support level since April 16. In a June 2 TradingView post , TradingShot noted that after testing this level, BTC immediately rebounded. While the bullish reaction has been moderate since price action remains capped below the four-hour 50-period MA, there are compelling reasons to expect an imminent breakout. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Specifically, the formation of a blue Arc pattern over the past three weeks mirrors the price behavior seen during previous peaks and pullbacks since Bitcoin’s early April bottom. These Arc patterns have historically signaled significant upward momentum once the price breaks above resistance. Adding to the bullish case, the four-hour Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) dipped into oversold territory for the first time since April 7. This condition suggests Bitcoin may be primed for a sharp reversal as buyers capitalize on discounted prices. Bitcoin’s next price target Even the weakest rally of this long-term bullish leg has seen gains of at least 16.06%. If the 4H MA200 continues to hold and Bitcoin breaks above the 4H MA50, TradingShot anticipates a minimum short-term rise of 16.06%, pushing BTC to approximately $120,000. As reported by Finbold, TradingShot previously suggested that historical price movements indicate that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by late 2025. Meanwhile, pseudonymous analyst El_crypto_prof highlighted a familiar chart setup in an X post : a final small dip before a powerful surge. With BTC hovering above $104,000, he identified $102,000 as a prime entry point and $97,000 as the critical floor for this bullish scenario to unfold. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Bitcoin price analysis Bitcoin was trading at $104,212 at press time, down about 0.9% over the past 24 hours. On the weekly timeline, the asset was also down 2.8%. Bitcoin one-week price chart. Source: Finbold Despite the consolidation, Bitcoin’s technical structure remains bullish, with the price significantly above its 50-day simple moving average ($98,885) and 200-day SMA ($86,995). This alignment suggests a strong upward trend and sustained bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the 14-day RSI sits at 54.83, indicating neutral conditions.

2025-06-02T17:16:36,"Strategy Doubles Down on Crypto with $75M Purchase of 705 Bitcoin","Strategy, led by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, announced on Monday that the firm has purchased an additional 705 Bitcoin for approximately $75.1 million between May 26 and 30, reinforcing the company’s ongoing commitment to the cryptocurrency. Strategy has acquired 705 BTC for ~$75.1 million at ~$106,495 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 16.9% YTD 2025. As of 6/1/2025, we hodl 580,955 $BTC acquired for ~$40.68 billion at ~$70,023 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF https://t.co/K4tex3qHrN — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 2, 2025 This purchase was funded by proceeds from the company’s active at-the-market (ATM) offerings of its preferred stock classes, STRK and STRF. The purchase period spanned from May 26 to June 1, 2025, and marks another milestone in the company’s long-running Bitcoin accumulation strategy. The firm now holds a total of 580,955 BTC acquired for an aggregate purchase price of roughly $40.68 billion, representing an average purchase price of $70,023 per bitcoin. This latest buy reflects Strategy’s ongoing commitment to its Bitcoin-centric corporate treasury strategy, where excess capital, including proceeds from equity offerings, is consistently redeployed into the cryptocurrency. With this move, Strategy also disclosed a bitcoin yield of 16.9% year-to-date, reinforcing its position as the largest corporate holder of BTC globally. The timing of this acquisition, at a higher average price compared to its long-term cost basis, suggests that Strategy views Bitcoin’s recent rally as a sign of longer-term strength rather than a peak. ATM Programs Fuel Expansion During the same period, Strategy said it has made use of its ATM equity programs to raise funds for both operational and investment purposes. Between May 26 and June 1, the company raised a total of $74.6 million across its ATM programs: $36.2 million from the sale of 353,511 STRK shares and $38.4 million from the sale of 374,968 STRF shares. These preferred stock instruments, each carrying attractive dividend yields of 8.00% and 10.00% respectively, were established earlier this year and have already shown strong traction in the market. As of June 1, there remains substantial capacity within these programs for future issuance—$20.68 billion for STRK and $2.05 billion for STRF—indicating Strategy’s intent to continue leveraging these instruments for growth and BTC accumulation. The company also declared quarterly cash dividends on both series of preferred shares, with STRK shareholders receiving $2.00 per share and STRF shareholders receiving approximately $2.64 per share. These payments are scheduled for June 30, 2025, to shareholders of record as of June 15. The dividend on the STRF shares includes an accrual from the issuance date of March 25, further underlining the firm’s attention to maintaining shareholder value alongside its bitcoin-centric strategy. K33 Says Strategy Slows Bitcoin Buys as MSTR Premium Shrinks K33 Research reports that Strategy appears to be easing its pace of Bitcoin acquisitions. In its latest filing, Strategy revealed it bought 4,020 BTC between May 19 and May 25 for $427.1 million, using proceeds from its ongoing $21 billion at-the-market (ATM) offering. However, capital raised from the program has slowed. Only $348.7 million was deployed during that week—down from $705.7 million the week prior and $1.31 billion in early May. K33 Head of Research Vetle Lunde attributes the deceleration to two key factors: a declining premium for MSTR shares relative to the firm’s Bitcoin holdings, and intensifying competition among corporations entering the Bitcoin treasury space. “The pace of ATM utilization is notably slower than the first round,” Lunde noted. Between early November and mid-December, Strategy raised an average of $2.13 billion weekly. In contrast, recent averages have dropped to $788 million.

2025-06-02T17:08:53,"Latest Development on Saudi Prince’s $100 Million Investment in XRP","In a major development shaking the crypto landscape, a Saudi prince , Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Saud, has reportedly executed a landmark $100 million investment in XRP. This move, initially reported by Times Tabloid , has drawn global attention as it signals deepening institutional and sovereign interest in the digital asset space. According to the latest official announcement by VivoPower International PLC on its X account, the prince’s acquisition will happen through a strategic partnership with BitGo, one of the world’s leading digital asset custody providers. This collaboration ensures that the prince’s ambitious entry into XRP is securely handled, leveraging BitGo’s world-class infrastructure and treasury solutions. BitGo @BitGo Enters Strategic Partnership with VivoPower $VVPR to Facilitate its Initial US$100 Million XRP Acquisition for Treasury Strategy 𝗥𝗘𝗔𝗗 https://t.co/wi4KosTMH0 pic.twitter.com/Tmm3OArx5E — VivoPower (@Vivo_Power) June 2, 2025 BitGo’s Pivotal Role in Facilitating the Investment BitGo’s reputation in the digital asset space cannot be overstated. As a global leader in digital asset custody, BitGo brings multi-signature security, regulatory compliance, and advanced treasury management capabilities, which are crucial for institutional investors. The platform processes more than $1 billion in transactions monthly and is particularly geared toward helping institutional clients integrate crypto into traditional financial operations securely. By partnering with VivoPower, BitGo has effectively provided the operational backbone to facilitate the prince’s $100 million XRP acquisition. This collaboration marks a vital moment not only for the involved parties but also for the broader crypto market, demonstrating how institutional-grade custodianship can enable sovereign and high-net-worth investors to navigate the crypto industry. VivoPower’s Expanding Crypto-Focused Treasury Strategy VivoPower has been steadily advancing its digital asset strategy over the past year. Through its subsidiary, Tembo e-LV, the company has already made headlines by announcing that it would accept payments in Bitcoin (BTC), XRP, and Dogecoin (DOGE) for its electric vehicles. This progressive step reflects VivoPower’s belief in digital currencies as both a medium of exchange and a treasury reserve asset. In its public statement, VivoPower emphasized that the prince’s XRP acquisition aligns with its broader treasury strategy : holding portions of reserves in digital assets while applying prudent market assessments and risk controls. This approach is designed to enhance the company’s financial flexibility and capture the potential upside in the fast-growing crypto sector. Ripple’s Growing Global Footprint The prince’s investment in XRP arrives at a time when Ripple, the company behind XRP, is rapidly expanding its global presence. Ripple has established numerous partnerships with financial institutions, payment providers, and fintech hubs worldwide to push the adoption of blockchain-based solutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Notably, Ripple recently announced a collaboration with South Korea’s BDACS to strengthen institutional custody services for XRP and RLUSD, Ripple’s dollar-backed stablecoin. These global partnerships continue to strengthen XRP’s standing as a bridge currency for cross-border transactions, a role that significantly differentiates it from many other cryptocurrencies in the market. Institutional and Sovereign Confidence in XRP While retail investors have long been engaged with XRP, the entrance of sovereign players such as a Saudi royal into the ecosystem is a powerful endorsement. This investment signals growing confidence in XRP’s long-term utility, particularly for cross-border payments and liquidity management. Moreover, it suggests that sovereign wealth, family offices, and institutional treasuries are increasingly looking to diversify into digital assets, recognizing them not only as speculative instruments but as essential components of modern financial portfolios. A Landmark Moment for the Crypto Market The BitGo-VivoPower partnership facilitating this $100 million XRP acquisition by a Saudi prince marks a watershed moment in the institutionalization of cryptocurrencies. It demonstrates how far the industry has matured, with sophisticated infrastructure now available to support even the most demanding investors. As digital assets continue to embed themselves into global financial frameworks, such high-profile investments are expected to accelerate, signaling a new era where cryptocurrencies like XRP are no longer fringe instruments but foundational components of modern treasury strategies.
