During his session, Garlinghouse spoke about one of the biggest mistakes he believes people in the crypto space continue to make. “It’s not about the 300 million people already in crypto doing more — it’s about getting 3 billion more people involved,” he explained, urging the industry to shift its focus from internal rivalries to global adoption. “The Bitcoin community is not our enemy — they really are not. If they do well, we’re going to do well. We might do better. It’s just like, it’s not a zero-sum game. And I think the one thing I learned — I was in Silicon Valley for 24 years — the one thing you learn is tech is not a zero-sum game. We’re going to grow the pie,” he added. Garlinghouse also hinted at Ripple’s expanding vision beyond its native token. Discussing Ripple’s acquisition of a prime brokerage and deeper involvement with traditional finance players, he opened up about how the company is positioning itself at the intersection of crypto-native innovation and Wall Street strategy. According to him, DeFi won’t simply replace traditional finance — the two need to work together. Ripple has spent nearly a decade bridging that gap, especially through its payments business. He said this is a long-term journey that will play out over several years. The community has been very patient as Ripple has faced some tough challenges. The Hidden Road acquisition is about building stronger connections between traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi). The Ripple CEO’s comments come at a time when market narratives often pit crypto communities against one another. His remarks serve as a timely reminder that in an industry still fighting for mainstream adoption, unity could be the real competitive edge.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-community-is-not-xrp-armys-enemy-declares-ripple-ceo-brad-garlinghouse/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|XRP","News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

2025-06-02T08:48:33,"Cardano crosses 110M total transactions but technicals signal more downside","Cardano has surpassed 110 million total transactions, marking a significant milestone in the blockchain’s ongoing growth. As of press time, the network has recorded 110.09 million transactions, according to Cardanoscan data . This shows consistent adoption and usage throughout its ecosystem. Furthermore, nearly 22 billion Cardano ( ADA ) are currently staked in 2,992 active stake pools, indicating a strong community involvement in network upkeep and security. ADA’s market performance has remained strained despite the rising network activity. With a modest 0.9% increase over the previous day, the token is now trading at $0.6811. However, ADA is still down more than 11% over the past week. Over the last day, it has recorded $541 million in trading volume, which represents an 8.5% increase. This shows rising market activity, though not necessarily in a bullish direction. In the derivatives market, open interest has increased by 2% to $818 million while trading volume is up by over 13% to $1.14 billion. This rise in leverage suggests that more traders are betting on ADA, possibly in expectation of more volatility or directional movements. You might also like: SEC delays Grayscale’s Avalanche and Cardano ETF decisions to July From a technical perspective, most momentum and trend indicators suggest the path of least resistance is still down. ADA is trading below major moving averages, such as the 10, 20, 50, and 200-day levels, all of which indicate that the bearish trend will continue. Cardano price analysis. Credit: crypto.news The downward pressure is supported by the negative moving average convergence divergence. At 38, the relative strength index is bearish but not yet in oversold territory. Further declines, perhaps toward the $0.65 region, could be possible if the $0.67 support area breaks. On the other hand, a short-term reversal might occur if the price is able to bounce back and close above the $0.72 range. Meanwhile, development activity on the Cardano network has been steady. The Cardano Foundation released its 2025 Ecosystem Guide in late April, which featured practical applications in industries like real estate and supply chain. Around the same time, on Apr. 20, Input Output Global announced a collaboration with BitcoinOS to introduce decentralized Bitcoin ( BTC ) rollups to Cardano through zero-knowledge proofs. The implementation is anticipated to take place later this year. In another update, Brave confirmed in May that it has integrated ADA support into its browser wallet, and the beta version is now available. Most recently, on June 1, Wanchain added cross-chain routes to the Cardano ecosystem for the transfer of stablecoins like USD Coin ( USDC ) and Tether ( USDT ). Later in 2025, Cardano-native stablecoins such as USDA and USDM are expected to go live.

2025-06-02T08:46:32,"CZ suggests building a ‘dark pool’ for DEX perpetual futures after James Wynn’s major loss","Former Binance CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao suggests building a pool for decentralized perpetual futures that keeps orders hidden until the transaction is completed to avoid mass liquidations. Recently, high-risk whale James Wynn suffered $100 million losses in liquidated high-leveraged positions. In a recent post , the head of YZi Labs urged budding on-chain builders and innovators to reach out to him if they are interested in bringing his idea into reality. The Binance founder believes it is “a good time” for the crypto space to have its own “dark pool perp DEX .” Typically, decentralized exchanges make all on-chain trades and orders visible to everyone. In the case of perpetual DEXs, which let you trade leveraged contracts, this means that every trader can also see all positions and liquidation points happening in real-time. According to Zhao, this poses a problem because long positions started by traders attempting to purchase large amounts of coin would be visible to other traders. The position would become a big red target for other traders intent on pushing the market to liquidate it. They could buy more tokens to make the position’s value go down before it closes or they would take advantage of the opportunity to launch MEV bot attacks in the pool. “This results in increased slippage, worse prices, and higher costs for you,” said CZ. Given recent events, I think now might be a good time for someone to launch a dark pool perp DEX. I have always been puzzled with the fact that everyone can see your orders in real-time on a DEX. The problem is worse on a perp DEX where there are liquidations. Even with a CEX… — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) June 1, 2025 As a result, CZ believes there should be a pool that keeps orders and trades hidden from other traders to prevent huge losses occurring while the transactions are being processed. He believes it could be achieved by not opening the order book to all traders or by keeping deposits into smarts contracts hidden until after the transaction is completed. CZ remarked that this sort of solution has already been implemented in traditional finance, where institutional traders are able to make large purchases invisible to other entities using “dark pools.” These pools are essentially private trading venues that do not make trades publicly visible until after they are executed. “Even with a CEX order book, where orders aren’t linked to a specific individual, if you’re looking to purchase $1 billion worth of a coin, you generally wouldn’t want others to notice your order until it’s completed,” said CZ. Zhao’s statement follows a chain of long position leverages which have resulted in disastrous losses for the traders involved. You might also like: CZ says we need more dApps after new chains crash On May 31, prominent high-risk, high-reward crypto trader James Wynn, known for opening high-leverage positions on-chain, suffered substantial losses when the market turned on him. After Wynn was seen opening a 40x-leveraged Bitcoin ( BTC ) position valued at $46.4 million, and one on Pepe ( PEPE ) worth $16 million, the price of BTC fell from a record high of $111,900 to $101,911 when he liquidated. Not only that, PEPE also plummeted from $0.00001625 to $0.000025. This led to Wynn closing his leveraged Bitcoin trade with a loss of $37 million and his Pepe trade was liquidated with a loss of over $858,580. The recent liquidations, which totaled about $100 million this week, marked a major loss for Wynn. Another similar incident occurred back in March, when a group of traders banded together to launch a “ man-hunt ” to liquidate a whale’s BTC short position valued around $450 million on Hyperliquid. Many of the large-scale positions that went viral this year were launched on the Layer 1 DEX Hyperliquid.

The company disclosed that the average purchase price for this latest batch was 15.5 million yen per Bitcoin, bringing the total transaction value to approximately 16.88 billion yen, worth $117.5 million. Metaplanet Ramps Up Bitcoin Treasury Play In its latest update , the company stated that its overall average purchase price now stands at 13.75 million yen per Bitcoin, with the total aggregated amount spent reaching 122.269 billion yen. Following this purchase, Metaplanet’s total holdings have increased to 8,888 BTC. This move continues Metaplanet’s strategy of strengthening its position in digital assets. Inspired by the business intelligence firm, Strategy’s corporate Bitcoin playbook, and Michael Saylor’s leadership, Metaplanet adopted its BTC treasury strategy in April 2024. Since then, it has rapidly built one of the largest BTC holdings. It now leads in Asia and is the tenth-largest public company globally that owns Bitcoin. The Japanese firm’s most recent acquisition brings it closer to its ambitious 10,000 BTC target for 2025. Metaplanet shares rose 9.75% on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today, closing at 1,171 yen at 3:30 PM JST. According to Yahoo Finance data , the stock is up over 236% year-to-date. $21M Bond Deal Last month, Metaplanet announced the issuance of $21 million in zero-coupon bonds to Evo Fund, after closing a separate $50 million funding round. Labeled the 17th series, these bonds have a face value of $525,000 each and mature on November 28, 2025. Because they bear no interest, Metaplanet avoids incurring any borrowing costs. The issuance terms allow Evo Fund to redeem the bonds early, either entirely or in increments of $525,000, by providing five days’ notice. These early redemptions may also coincide with subsequent funding activities involving the same investor. As unsecured instruments with no guarantees or third-party administrators, the bonds comply with Japan’s corporate legal framework. Payment procedures will be managed at the company’s Tokyo office. The financing move is in line with Metaplanet’s broader goal of accumulating Bitcoin without diluting shareholder equity.

2025-06-02T08:20:00,"Pi Network Price Prediction 2025-2031: Will Pi Price surpass previous ATH?","Key Takeaways: Pi price faces bearish pressure below the $0.65 resistance. Our Pi network price prediction expects the Pi price to surge to a maximum level of $1.42 in 2025. In 2031, Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $4.84. Pi Network has entered a period of instability since the final KYC verification deadline on March 14, 2025. Users who failed to verify and transfer their tokens to the mainnet lost access to their Pi holdings. The transition was completed on Pi Day, blockchain upgrades were introduced, and PiFest was launched to help more people use Pi. While some transfers went smoothly for users, others experienced problems and unexpected losses. These complications contributed to sharp price fluctuations. Adding to the pressure, more than 102 million Pi tokens were moved from OKX recently, signalling strong selling activity. Despite this, Pi Network continues to push ecosystem growth. Additionally, the recent launch of a $100 million venture fund aims to support dApp development on the Pi blockchain. While these developments could support long-term value, short-term sentiment remains cautious. In this outlook, we’ll assess how Pi’s price has responded to recent events and provide an informative Pi network price prediction model from 2025 to 2031.

MACD shows slight bullish divergence, but the signal line still holds downward dominance. RSI is near 40, indicating weak momentum. The Pi Network price has shown slight stabilization on June 2 after recent losses, trading at around $0.6415 with a minor loss of 0.2% in the last 24 hours. The MACD remains below the signal line, signaling continued downside momentum and a lack of bullish strength. The RSI is at 39, trading below the neutral 50 mark. This indicates weak buying interest and market hesitation. As price action struggles to reclaim higher levels, the broader market shows consolidation, reflecting caution among investors awaiting a decisive shift in trend. Pi price analysis 1-day chart: Bearish momentum dominates as indicators stay weak On the 1-day chart, Pi Network continues to trade under bearish pressure, with the price moving around $0.64. The market structure shows a consolidation, with both side traders struggling to validate a clear move. PI/USDT Chart on TradingView The MACD indicator reinforces this view, with the MACD line still trending below the signal line. Despite slight histogram contraction, there is no confirmed bullish crossover, suggesting that downward momentum may persist in the short term. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits around 40.5, showing weak bullish momentum and confirming low buyer activity. This places Pi in a bearish momentum zone, with no clear sign of reversal yet. Pi/USDT 4-hour price chart The 4-hour chart for Pi Network (PI/USDT) shows a struggle among buyers to hold the price above EMA trend lines. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 39.21, indicating weak bullish momentum and room for further downside. PI/USDT Chart on TradingView A bullish crossover on the MACD suggests a potential shift in sentiment. Key resistance lies near $0.66, while $0.60 acts as strong support. A sustained move above resistance could confirm a short-term trend reversal.

The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.72 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly—neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Is Pi A Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.66 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly—neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is the Pi Price Down Today? Pi Coin is down today due to growing investor exits, as shown by large exchange inflows and insufficient demand to support price stability. Will Pi Price Reach $5? If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $5 mark. Will Pi Reach $10? Depending on the current market sentiment, the PI price might take several years to reach the $10 milestone. We expect the Pi price to achieve $10 by 2033.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History: Coinmarketcap Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction it was still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 in over-the-counter or sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. April 2025 Pi network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. May 2025 , the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi shows sideways-to-bullish movement, with potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72 if support at $0.60 holds.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/pi-network-price-prediction/,"ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network",cryptocompare

2025-06-02T08:13:28,"Meta Shareholders Reject Proposal to Add Bitcoin to Balance Sheet","Key Takeaways: Meta shareholders rejected a proposal to add Bitcoin to the company’s balance sheet. Bitcoin advocate Ethan Peck pushed the plan, arguing it would hedge against inflation. More public companies, including GameStop and Tesla, continue adding Bitcoin to their treasuries. Meta shareholders have overwhelmingly voted down a proposal to explore adding Bitcoin to the company’s balance sheet, according to a May 28 regulatory filing. The so-called “Bitcoin treasury assessment” proposal received just 3.92 million votes in favor — representing only 0.08% of the total — while nearly 5 billion shares voted against the measure. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who holds 61% of the company’s voting power, likely voted against it. Bitcoin Advocate Urged Meta to Invest Part of $72B Cash in BTC The proposal originated from Bitcoin advocate Ethan Peck, who in January urged Meta to allocate a portion of its $72 billion cash reserves into Bitcoin, calling it a potential hedge against inflation. “Since cash is consistently being debased and bond yields are lower than the true inflation rate, 28% of Meta’s total assets are consistently diminishing shareholder value,” Peck argued in his supporting statement. He also pointed to BlackRock’s guidance suggesting a 2% Bitcoin allocation as reasonable. Peck, who submitted the proposal on behalf of his family’s Meta shares, serves as Bitcoin director for the wealth management firm Strive.

Microsoft shareholders voted against Peck’s proposal in December . Amazon shareholders are expected to vote on a related measure — proposing a 5% Bitcoin allocation — in the coming months. Analysts note that while some Big Tech firms remain cautious about adding volatile crypto assets to their balance sheets, the landscape is shifting globally. Public Companies Continue to Invest in Bitcoin Meanwhile, the number of public companies holding Bitcoin continues to grow. According to data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET, 116 public firms have now added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Recent additions include GameStop and Swedish health tech company H100. MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 580,250 BTC worth approximately $60.9 billion. Other major holders include Marathon Digital Holdings and Tesla, both with over $1 billion in Bitcoin. As reported, digital asset companies are flooding capital markets to raise funds for large-scale Bitcoin acquisitions , spurred by the cryptocurrency’s rally to a record $111,965 last week. The surge, up more than 50% from early April, has ignited a wave of listings and mergers as firms race to secure funding while investor appetite remains strong. Last week, Trump Media & Technology Group confirmed plans to raise $2.5 billion to buy crypto, joining a growing list of firms mimicking MicroStrategy’s blueprint. Just recently, French crypto holding company Blockchain Group announced plans to purchase an additional $72 million worth of Bitcoin following a successful €63.3 million bond sale, as it expands its aggressive treasury strategy.

2025-06-02T08:09:38,"Michael Saylor Signals Another Bitcoin Acquisition for Strategy: Details","Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy, has once again hinted at an impending Bitcoin acquisition by the company, sharing a Bitcoin chart on X and famously stating, “Orange is my preferred color.” This signals the eighth consecutive week of purchases by the firm, underscoring its unwavering commitment to the leading crypto. Saylor has seen his influence steadily grow over the past two years, largely due to Strategy’s aggressive corporate treasury strategy centered around Bitcoin . Strategy Bitcoin Acquisition The company’s most recent Bitcoin acquisition on May 26 saw it add 4,020 BTC, valued at approximately $427 million at the time of purchase. This brought Strategy’s total holdings to a staggering 580,250 BTC. According to data compiled by Bitcoin Treasuries, this positions Strategy as the single largest known Bitcoin holder. Its BTC reserves significantly outweigh the combined holdings of the US and Chinese governments. CryptoQuant analyst Ki Young Ju suggests that the company’s rapid accumulation is already reshaping market dynamics, while executives from crypto-native Sygnum Bank have indicated that this institutional buying could trigger a supply shock, potentially driving BTC prices higher. While authors like Adam Livingston have characterized Strategy as an emerging financial superpower due to its substantial Bitcoin holdings, not all investors are entirely convinced by the reported accumulation figures. Scrutiny Over Holdings and Transparency Concerns A growing segment of market participants has expressed skepticism and suspicion regarding Strategy’s reported Bitcoin treasury , citing a notable absence of regular proof-of-reserve audits. This lack of transparency has led some to question the veracity of the company’s claims. One individual, responding to Saylor’s recent acquisition post, directly challenged him, stating that “No proof of reserves is your preferred ‘trust me bro,'” and further questioned the presence of the Bitcoin on the mempool or if it was merely “paper Bitcoin.” In response to such criticisms, the Strategy co-founder has consistently argued that conducting proof-of-reserve audits for large enterprises and institutions carries inherent risks. He contends that such audits could expose the institutions’ wallets to unwanted tracking and attention from potential threat actors.

2025-06-02T08:09:26,"Best New Crypto to Hodl While BTC Trades Sideways per Analysts","Is Bitcoin too hot for the market to handle? The world’s leading crypto stalled out over the weekend, falling to just above $103K early on before rebounding to $105K. Prices remained generally stable within a 0.4% movement. But take a closer look, and there may be signs that the world’s largest crypto is in for a pause before resuming its strong upward momentum. That could set the stage for the best new crypto to make big moves. Do Technical Factors Point to ‘Overheating’? Data from CryptoQuant points to the possibility that a volatile past month has led to overheating in the market, with demand approaching levels seen around the previous all-time-high in December 2024. At the same time, whale holdings are up 2.8%, indicating increased confidence in $BTC’s long-term prospects. Bitcoin’s RSI (Relative Strength Index) sits solidly at a neutral 52, well below the 70-80 range that often indicates increased risk of overheating. Does the rapid rise in $BTC demand and the growing whale accumulation point to overheating? Or is it setting the stage for another run to a key resistance level? Potential Short-Term Top at $120K Could Mark Key Resistance Level A short-term top indicates the point where traders may take profits after a strong run. As the name indicates, they tend to be temporary in nature, overshadowed by broader market movements over the course of weeks or months. In Bitcoin’s case, whale accumulation could be setting the stage for a push to $120K, a point where traders may be content to realize their gains. The $120K resistance mark would be another all-time high. If demand is already beginning to peak, it could prove to be the next milestone Bitcoin needs to push through. Bitcoin attracts constant analysis and speculation, well-deserved for the world’s best-performing asset. But the attention obscures the fact that some of the biggest potential gains can be found in crypto presales, which offer investors the chance to get in on the ground level of projects before they attract widespread attention. Here are three of the best new crypto to watch. 1. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – AI Agent Creator Platform That Revolutionizes $85B Market Online content creation is an $85B market, and SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is ready to turn it upside down. The project takes a red-hot market sector and adds blockchain technology and an AI toolset. No more middle men; fans and creators can support one another directly with the $SUBBD token. Fans get: Exclusive content access VIP staking benefits Platform discounts Loyalty and rewards programs Creators unlock: AI content management, including automated livestreams and content listing AI influencer tools, such as AI voicenotes and video generation Over 2K content creators are already on board, boasting over 250M combined followers. That’s a massive market, and $SUBBD is already capitalizing on the potential. The presale has raised over $580K so far, with token currently priced at $0.05555. Our own $SUBBD price prediction indicates the token could rise to $0.301 by the end of 2025, delivering 441% gains to presale investors. Phase 1 of the SUBBD Token roadmap is already underway, with top creators on board and limited AI functionality. The rest – including the full AI toolkit and $SUBBD token listing on CEXs and DEXs – will occur after the TGE (Token Generation Event) when the presale ends. Learn how to buy $SUBBD , and check out the presale page . 2. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Hold $BTCBULL for Free $BTC Airdrops BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) keeps things simple. Buy $BTCBULL and hold it on your Best Wallet app . Earn free $BTC when Bitcoin’s price reaches $150K and $200K. It’s another way for Bitcoin maximalists to earn even more from the world’s leading crypto. In fact, with BTC Bull, investors gain four ways to earn from a single project: $BTCBULL staking rewards $BTCBULL price increase post-launch $BTC airdrops when Bitcoin reaches $150K and $200K $BTCBULL airdrop when Bitcoin hits $250K In-between, $BTCBULL token burns will occur at $BTC $125K, $175K, and $225K. These could boost $BTCBULL’s price action by making tokens more scarce. The combination of token burns and airdrops keeps $BTCBULL tied to Bitcoin’s steady progress. With some experts already predicting that Bitcoin will reach $250K as soon as this year, BTC Bull’s timing couldn’t be better. And good timing is something all of the best meme coins share. It’s one of the reasons our BTC Bull price prediction shows the token potentially reaching $0.006467, up 154% from its current price of $0.00254. Those would be bullish gains indeed for $BTCBULL, with free $BTC to boot. Learn how to buy BTC Bull and visit the presale page . 3. Nexchain AI ($NEX) – AI-Native Layer 1 Blockchain Nexchain ($NEX) offers an entirely AI-built blockchain. Not just AI-managed, but AI-built, combining decentralized security measures and tech developments. Nexchain will provide a native AI chain that adaptive and high-performance, perfect for efficient, automated industries, including: Finance Healthcare Supply chain management IoT Decentralized AI services Self-optimizing AI smart contracts can update operations and execute decisions based on predefined rules, while the blockchain architecture employs sharding and Directed Acrylic Graphs (DAGs) for minimal congestion and lighting-fast speeds. The $NEX token powers the entire ecosystem, adding incentives to participation that include platform governance, staking rewards, and liquidity provisioning. Nexchain AI’s presale passed $3.6M, with one $NEX token priced at $0.062. Bitcoin’s Pivot Point Opens Door for Best New Crypto Bitcoin may open the week strong, or remain stuck in a rut. It seems nearly certain that the world’s largest token will continue to grow as the crypto economy grows, whether it pivots downward for the short-term or not. Alongside Bitcoin, new crypto like $SUBBD and $BTCBULL presents early investors an opportunity for solid returns. Do your own research in any case. But don’t miss out on the opportunity for crypto presales like the ones above to sneak under the radar and provide 5x, 10x, or even 100x ROI for savvy investors.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/best-new-crypto-to-hodl-while-btc-trades-sideways-per-analysts/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News",cryptocompare

Elon Musk said that the social media platform's new messaging feature, XChat, is now live, will use Bitcoin (BTC)-style encryption, and will support all file types. Musk announced that XChat has been released with Bitcoin-style encryption, end-to-end security, disappearing messages, voice and video calling, and support for all file types.

This is built on Rust with (Bitcoin style) encryption, whole new architecture. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2025 Musk's statement that this feature is built on Rust with Bitcoin-style encryption and has a completely new architecture has sparked a backlash from Bitcoin developers and cryptography experts. Bitcoin Core developer and OCEAN CTO Luke Dashjr responded to Musk's post by saying, “Bitcoin doesn't even use encryption.” JAN3 CEO and Bitcoin supporter Samson Mow echoed the same sentiment, saying, “Bitcoin is not encrypted.” Musk’s statement comes after Telegram CEO Pavel Durov last week claimed that Telegram had entered into a year-long partnership with Musk’s xAI, including a $300 million payments and app integration deal.

Predictions suggest XRP could reach $5.05 by the end of 2025. Long-term projections show XRP could hit $26.50 by 2030 and $526 by 2050. XRP, one of the top 5 assets known for its cross-border solutions, has seen tremendous adoption and fame since President Trump took office in the US. Even the XRP price prediction is gaining serious attention as Ripple XRP shows strong bullish signals across the market. With institutional adoption like from banks are rising, on-chain metrics heating up, and ETF odds are higher in 2025. Moreover, Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC nearing its end, many investors are asking: Will XRP reach 100? Could the XRP price prediction of $500 actually happen in the long run? This article would answer those question’s dive into XRP price prediction 2025, 2026-2030. Table of contents CoinPedia’s Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025 XRP Price Today XRP Crypto Price Prediction May 2025 XRP Price Prediction 2025 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 XRP Price Prediction 2026 Ripple Price Prediction 2027 XRP Price Prediction 2028 XRP Price Prediction 2029 XRP Price Prediction 2030 Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis Institutional XRP Price Targets for 2025 FAQs CoinPedia’s Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025 With regulatory clarity from the SEC case and Ripple accelerating its expansion, we at CoinPedia are optimistic about the XRP forecast. We expect the XRP coin price to reach $5.81 in 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 XRP Price Today Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 2.16569130 0.83% Market cap $ 127,255,422,956.08 Circulating Supply 58,759,724,027.00 Trading Volume $ 1,962,911,921.3992 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Crypto Price Prediction May 2025 XRP is currently pulling back after testing a declining trendline at $2.65 in mid-May. Throughout the rest of May, it dipped below a high-volume profile level. In the early days of June, XRP is attempting to hold above last month’s swing low of $2.10. If XRP manages to rebound and break through the strong resistance at $2.40, it could pave the way for a rally toward $2.80 and potentially retest its all-time high at $3.40. However, a continued drop below the $2.10 support zone could push the price further down toward $1.88 and $1.63. Additionally, rising volatility indicates that XRP’s previously dull and consolidative price action may soon give way to significant movement. Still, low trading volume remains a concern, as it reflects weak market participation—an essential ingredient for sustaining any strong momentum. However, if both volatility and volume begin to rise along with strong buying conviction, XRP could witness a significant price surge in June. XRP Price Prediction 2025 If XRP successfully breaks its all-time high of $3.40 in May 2025—a major supply zone on the chart—it could realistically target $5 by year-end, fueled by growing optimism from banks , institutions, and potential ETF support. Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD , is now integrated into its cross-border payments system, Ripple Payments, further strengthening its position in global finance. Notably, institutional dominance is evident, with the top 100 addresses holding 70% of the circulating supply, positioning XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $138 billion. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.05 $3.45 $5.05 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.50 6.25 8.50 2027 7.00 9.0 13.25 2028 11.25 13.75 16.00 2029 14.25 16.50 21.50 2030 17.00 19.75 26.50 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP cost will likely witness strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.50 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum price of XRP will be around $5.50, with an average trading price of $6.25. Ripple Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP coin price will range between $7.00 to $13.25. XRP price might record an average level of $9.00. XRP Price Prediction 2028 As per our XRP price prediction 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases. We expect the XRP future price to range between $11.25 to $16.00. The average trading price of Ripple could be around $13.75. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The price of XRP might record a trading range between $14.25 to $21.50, with an average price of $16.50. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The XRP prediction 2030 depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the Ripple coin price could scale between $17.00 to $26.50. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.75. Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Based on historic price sentiments and XRP’s rising popularity, here are the XRP future price projections for 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, and 2050.

Yes, XRP is still a good investment for those with a long-term view. With the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit nearing settlement, increasing institutional interest, and rising on-chain activity, XRP’s fundamentals remain strong. The integration of RLUSD and potential ETF listings further boosts its utility and market potential. While short-term volatility may persist, XRP price prediction models point to significant upside. If regulatory clarity continues, XRP could be well-positioned to reach ambitious targets like $100—or even higher—in the coming years. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-02T07:49:58,"Bitcoin Price Prediction for June 2025: Here’s What to Expect From the BTC Price","The post Bitcoin Price Prediction for June 2025: Here’s What to Expect From the BTC Price appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin price remained consolidated below $106,000 throughout the weekend, suggesting the sellers maintained their dominance. As the weekly divergence has been locked in, a potential bearish retest seems to be forming finely. Despite the price trying to overcome the bearish pullback, the BTC price failed to secure a crucial range, which keeps the bearish hopes alive. Hence, the upcoming price action in June could witness a roller coaster ride in either direction, but the question is whether the token will be able to reclaim $110K. Investors Remain Sceptical on the Next Price Action The Bitcoin bulls have been holding the rally above an important support level at $102,153 ever since the price surged above the range in May. The recent bounce also substantiates the bullish claim to some extent, but the traders seem to be more interested in the current price range between $103,000 and $107,000, as they have been placing huge bets within the range. This suggests the traders are preparing for both scenarios, and as a result, liquidity is piling up on either side. The data from Coinglass suggests the short liquidation after the price rose above $105,500, while the longs have remained untouched at around $103,500. Hence, there are more possibilities of the price testing the price range, which could offer a significant bullish push towards the higher range, which is limited to $106,200. However, a rise above this range could require huge liquidity; meanwhile, the volume has dropped since the start of the month, but the bulls have maintained some dominance. Will BTC Price Mark a New ATH in June 2025 Considering the recent price action, it is quite obvious that the BTC price is expected to consolidate along the local highs for a while. However, the price action that could follow may certainly not be in favour of the bulls. If the price follows the historical price action, the star crypto is feared to undergo a steep correction soon. A popular analyst, anonymously known as AlphaBTC , shares the similarities in the recent price action of Bitcoin, which raises the possibility of a pullback to $90,000 or slightly below. However, the analyst is quite sure of the bullish reversal, which may lead the Bitcoin price to new highs, probably to $125,000. But before this, a correction appears imminent as the indicators like RSI, MACD, CMF, and DMI are about to undergo a bearish reversal. Regardless of the horizontal consolidation, El Salvador, Metaplanet, BlackRock, and Strategy continue to stack Bitcoin. Moreover, some are raising funds to buy more Bitcoin, which should be considered a huge bullish signal, as the real bull run is yet to begin.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-price-prediction-for-june-2025-heres-what-to-expect-from-the-btc-price/,"BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 In May 2025, Bitcoin witnessed an unstoppable and steady ascent. This recovery was fueled by easing tensions from the trade tariff war, pushing BTC to a new all-time high of $112K. However, by the final week of May, the price dipped to $103,500 — a key support area that had formed during the month. Now, in the early days of June, Bitcoin is attempting to hold this support level after pulling back from its all-time high. Yet, it continues to face resistance from the 20-day EMA band. If bearish pressure increases again, this support zone becomes crucial. A breakdown below it could lead to a further decline toward the $100K to $95K range in the short term. Additionally, market sentiment has shifted from optimism to pessimism over the past 24 hours. The BTC long/short ratio has dropped from 1.0141 to 0.9399, signaling a weakening bullish grip. This indicates that bullish momentum has stalled, and bears are no longer on the sidelines—they are actively pushing the price lower. On the flip side, if bearish pressure fades and sentiment improves, Bitcoin would need to break past its newly formed all-time high to resume upward momentum. If this happens, BTC will enter price discovery mode, targeting a near-term level of $120,000, with the potential for even higher gains in the months ahead. On-chain data shows that a significant amount of dormant Bitcoin, unmoved for 1 to 2 years, has recently become active. This type of movement is often viewed as a bearish signal, indicating that short-term holders (those holding for less than two years) may be preparing to sell. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 A key factor driving the potential for higher Bitcoin prices is the relationship with global liquidity. Historical trends reveal that as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences dramatic price surges. Now, with global liquidity beginning to rise again after a prolonged period of stagnation, the stage seems set for another major rally in Bitcoin’s value. This shift in liquidity could create the perfect environment for Bitcoin to soar once more. Also, cryptoquant data suggest that accumulation is on top with exchange reserve declining at more alarming rates. When writing 2.4 Milliion BTC were in total on the exchange reserves, which is a strong decline from a year ago when reserves were 3.1 Million BTC. Source: CryptoQuant Talking about Bitcoin Price Prediction, if things turn bullish, BTC is expected to create a high of $175K. If things go south, we can expect a low of $70K.

(@Metaplanet_JP) June 2, 2025 The recent addition to the treasury arrived just days after Metaplanet arranged another $21M bond funding round with the goal of new acquisitions. The acquisitions added to last week’s BTC hype, but failed to keep the current price above $105,000. BTC still traded at $104,850 in the new week, expecting more news of corporate buying. As usual, the recent BTC purchase announcement had an effect on the Metaplanet market price. Recently, Metaplanet drew enough attention to become the go-to stock for indirect exposure to BTC for Japanese investors. The company aims for the effect of Strategy (MSTR) for the Japanese market. After the announcement, the Metaplanet market price rose to 1,142 JPY ($7.97), close to the recent monthly peak at 1,222 JPY. The shares recently became Japan’s most volatile stock, as interest shifted rapidly for the company during its latest series of BTC purchases. The stock effect repeats the behavior of other BTC treasury companies, which often gain in the short term following acquisition announcements. The effect has spread to public mining companies , which retained some of their net gains in the past month. Metaplanet has been one of the most regular buyers, among a trend to accumulate BTC in corporate treasuries. The latest reported purchases increased the total amount of stored BTC to 3.38M coins. A total of 116 public companies already hold treasuries, with accelerated additions in May. Metaplanet gains general attention Metaplanet is breaking the containment of Japanese investments. In the past few days, the company has increased its search volumes, originating from other developed crypto markets. Searches for ‘Metaplanet Inc.’ are up 300%, originating from the USA, Canada, and top crypto markets in the Euro area. Metaplanet is also getting close to building a $1B treasury, within a small price hike or another acquisition. The company also aims to retain a favorable ratio of assets to liabilities, by paying back older bonds. Metaplanet holds close to $1B in BTC, after the recent expansion to 8,888 coins. | Source: Arkham Intelligence Recently, the stock price saw rapid increase on the German market, sparking a new round of investor and social media interest. Metaplanet has continued buying even when other treasury companies had a pause due to market volatility. Metaplanet has kept a high-visibility profile on social media, often planning its acquisitions close to the schedule of Strategy. Despite the efforts, Metaplanet is still outside the top 10 of public company treasuries, as other new buyers hold larger legacy reserves from mining or previous acquisitions.

2025-06-02T07:25:54,"Liquidity Surge To Ignite the Next Crypto Bull Run","Global liquidity is quietly climbing again, and that could change everything for crypto markets. According to experts Michael Howell and Raoul Pal, this shift could trigger the next major bull run in digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Michael Howell, a global liquidity analyst, sees signs of a structural liquidity wave forming. This trend is fueled by the U.S. Treasury’s drawdown of its cash reserves and China’s aggressive monetary easing , which includes yuan devaluation—especially against gold. Howell argues this isn’t just a temporary boost but a long-term shift supported by growing fiscal pressures and rising debt levels. Raoul Pal agrees, but zooms in on crypto. He believes crypto assets are highly sensitive to liquidity changes, acting as ""high beta"" investments that react strongly to money flowing into global markets. Pal predicts we are entering the so-called “banana zone,” a period of exponential crypto gains sparked by liquidity, shifting narratives, and returning retail investors. His models suggest crypto market cap could more than triple by 2026, potentially surpassing $10 trillion. Still, both experts warn that this bull case depends on liquidity continuing to grow. If inflation returns or the U.S. Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy too quickly, it could stall the momentum. Volatility is also expected to remain high. For now, the signs are aligning.

2025-06-02T07:20:28,"Urgent Halt Demanded: NAACP Challenges xAI Data Center Operations in Memphis Over Pollution","BitcoinWorld Urgent Halt Demanded: NAACP Challenges xAI Data Center Operations in Memphis Over Pollution In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, the infrastructure powering these advancements is often overlooked. While the focus is typically on groundbreaking algorithms or new crypto applications leveraging AI, the physical footprint and energy demands of the necessary computing power are significant. This brings us to a developing situation in Memphis, Tennessee, where a major civil rights organization is raising serious alarms about one such facility: Elon Musk’s xAI data center. NAACP xAI Conflict Escalates Over ‘Dirty Data Center’ The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has directly challenged local officials in Memphis, urging them to stop operations at Colossus, the large-scale computing facility run by Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company, xAI. The conflict centers on environmental concerns surrounding the facility’s power generation. According to reports, NAACP leaders sent a letter to the Shelby County Health Department and Memphis Light Gas and Water (MLGW), criticizing what they described as a “lackadaisical approach” to overseeing the operation of this facility, which they labeled a “dirty data center.” The civil rights group’s demand is stark: issue an emergency order for xAI to cease operations completely. Failing that, they call for authorities to at least cite the company and prevent alleged violations of clean air regulations. Focus on the xAI Data Center and Its Power Needs The facility in question, known as Colossus, is described as a “supercomputer.” Building and operating an AI supercomputer requires immense electrical power, not just to run the processors but also for the extensive cooling systems needed to prevent overheating. While connecting to the local grid is standard, some large facilities, particularly those needing significant or highly reliable power, may supplement or primarily rely on on-site power generation, often using gas turbines. The NAACP’s concerns specifically target the gas turbines xAI is using at the Colossus site. The company has reportedly applied for a permit to operate 15 such turbines. However, the NAACP’s letter alleges that authorities have permitted xAI to operate at least 35 gas turbines without any necessary permitting over the past year. City officials have previously stated that permits were not required for the turbines’ initial year of operation, a point of contention for the NAACP. Environmental Pollution and Health Risks The core of the NAACP’s complaint revolves around the potential for environmental pollution emanating from these gas turbines. Such turbines can emit various hazardous air pollutants. The NAACP’s letter highlighted specific concerns: Emissions reportedly include formaldehyde at levels potentially exceeding EPA limits. Concerns were also raised about nitrogen-oxide emissions. These pollutants are known to have adverse health effects. The NAACP’s letter connects these emissions directly to existing health vulnerabilities in the community near the facility. The Memphis Data Center Location and Environmental Justice The location of the Memphis data center is a critical factor in the NAACP’s advocacy. The Colossus facility is situated near the Boxtown neighborhood in South Memphis. The NAACP described Boxtown as a “historically Black community.” This geographical context frames the issue as one of environmental justice. The NAACP argues that placing polluting industries near communities that are already vulnerable or historically marginalized perpetuates a trend where those who contribute least to environmental problems bear the brunt of the pollution’s impact. Their letter starkly points out that the area already faces significant health challenges, noting that cancer risks are reportedly four times the national average. They argue that instead of working to reduce these existing health issues, the Shelby County Health Department has allegedly allowed xAI to operate in a manner that could exacerbate them. What Happens Next? The NAACP’s letter puts pressure on local authorities, specifically the Shelby County Health Department and MLGW commissioners. The response from these entities will determine the immediate future of the xAI facility’s operations and potentially set precedents for how large, power-hungry AI infrastructure projects are regulated in the future. As of recent reports, a spokesperson for Memphis Light Gas and Water indicated they had not yet received the NAACP’s letter. Bitcoin World has reportedly reached out to both the NAACP and xAI for comment on the situation. The outcome of this conflict could have implications not only for xAI and the Memphis community but also for the broader conversation around the environmental footprint of artificial intelligence development and the siting of the massive data centers required to power the next generation of AI and potentially, the infrastructure supporting crypto technologies. Summary: A Growing Concern for AI Infrastructure The dispute between the NAACP and xAI over the Memphis data center highlights a growing area of concern: the environmental impact of the physical infrastructure needed for advanced AI computing. The allegations of operating numerous gas turbines without permits and potentially exceeding pollution limits raise serious questions about regulatory oversight and corporate responsibility. For the nearby Boxtown community, this is not just a technical issue but one with direct implications for public health and environmental equity. The NAACP’s call for an immediate halt underscores the urgency with which they view the potential risks posed by the facility’s current operations.

In a new video update on the Fundstrat Capital YouTube channel, Tom Lee says that court rulings against Trump’s tariffs suggest that the White House is losing leverage. “In our view, the tariff war and concerns have a bark worse than the bite. Let me explain, for instance… on May 28th, the international trade court ruled against the Trump tariffs. Now it didn’t remove all of them, but it ruled against them and on Thursday, May 29th, the DC District Court Judge Contreras ruled that [the] tariffs are illegal. So it’s two cases ruling against White House tariffs, but on the same day, the Federal Court of Appeals issued an administrative stay which reinstates the tariffs – at least through June 9th – but you can see this is getting quite complicated and the White House is insisting nothing has changed after the tariff rulings. And in fact, Goldman Sachs highlights that there’s many measures the White House can take to implement or re-implement tariffs. But ultimately, the White House is losing leverage, and it’s taking us closer to the endgame.” Lee also says that due to the rulings, Trump will struggle to revamp the trade war, and that the White House will be looking for an exit strategy on the matter soon. Lee goes on to note that tariff visibility and other factors have led to a better investment outlook for stocks now compared to earlier this year. “The investment outlook is better for stocks now arguably than it was in February 2025 because you’ve got tariff visibility, you have tax and deregulation visibility, [and] the companies survived [a] fifth major stress test… and the Fed is arguably more dovish next year.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-02T07:03:06,"Experienced Analyst Shares New Weekly Forecasts for Bitcoin (BTC) Price","Axel Adler Jr., an analyst at cryptocurrency analysis platform CryptoQuant, noted that despite Bitcoin’s recent brief pullback to $103,000-$104,000, fundamental indicators remain strong. According to Adler, Bitcoin reserves on exchanges continue to decline, institutional buying continues to put pressure on supply, and long-term investors are increasing their purchases, building a “buffer support” under the market. On the macroeconomic front, mixed signals prevail. While the slowdown in Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation in the US has eased policy pressure on the Fed to some extent, rising bond yields and uncertain tariffs have strengthened the “risk aversion” sentiment in the markets and suppressed growth appetite. Related News: Significant Cryptocurrency Bill Unveiled in South Korea - Expected to Pass Easily Adler stated that the basic scenario for the coming week is for Bitcoin to trend sideways between $103,000 and $110,000. However, if there is a 20% breakout due to momentum and an increase in trading volume and the $110,000 level is exceeded, he added that a strong signal could be formed that the market is ready to test the $115,000-$120,000 band. On the other hand, if net inflows turn negative and prices fall below $100,000, it could be a sign of a deeper correction. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-02T07:00:33,"Bitcoin Price Risks Break Down To $92,000 As It Enters Accumulation Phase","The Bitcoin price has turned bearish after hitting a new all-time high above $111,000 back in May. This turn in the tide was expected as the rally put Bitcoin holders in massive profit, showing a risk of profit-taking that could tank the price. So far, the price is already down by 6% % from its all-time high and trending at $104,000 at the time of this writing. But as bears take control, it is likely that the decline is far from over, and the cryptocurrency could fall below 6-figures again. The Pathology Of The Bitcoin All-Time High A pseudonymous analyst who goes by Youriverse on the TradingView website has explained the movement of the Bitcoin price over the past few weeks and why the market has been moving the way it has. As he explains, Bitcoin has been exhibiting what is known as a textbook accumulation since the uptrend began in the second week of May. This accumulation was part of the reason why the cryptocurrency rallied to new all-time highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Still Bullish, But $200,000 Off The Table And $137,000 In Sight At this time, the crypto analyst revealed that the Bitcoin price had seen more compression as it reached higher lows and resistance remained relatively flat. Additionally, the selling pressure that had rocked the Bitcoin price through the last few months due to the Donald Trump tariff wars had also waned at this time, putting the buyers in control of the price. The result of this is a possible ‘Power of 3’, which the analyst explains includes Accumulation, Manipulation, and Distribution. These three together were part of the reason that the Bitcoin price started moving upward. The resultant rally saw an initial push toward previous all-time high levels, and then subsequently, there was a push to a new all-time high above $111,000. However, the price action waned before Bitcoin could break $112,000. As a result of the dwindling upward pressure, a reversal was inevitable, and the Bitcoin price suffered a decline toward previous support levels at $106,000. However, this support has not held as it has since broken below this level, signaling “a notable shift in market structure.” Why A Decline To $92,000 Is Possible The analyst explained that the ‘Power of 3’ could be playing out right now, and this could see the price go further downward as larger investors dump on the lesser informed retail crowd. Furthermore, as the Bitcoin price continues to trend below the $106,000 support for longer, it increases the likelihood that the price could fall further. “The rejection above the ATH and the subsequent breakdown below $106K has introduced significant overhead supply, which may act as resistance in the near term,” the analyst said. Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Price Still Rally 1,000%? Analyst Reveals End-Of-Year Prediction Given this, he expects that the Bitcoin price could end up falling back to $100,000 and even reach as low as the mid-$90,000s. But if this happens, rather than triggering a bearish trend, it could mean an opportunity to buy, as this area could attract more liquidity and serve as a bounce-off point for another rally. “This potential pullback should not be viewed solely as a sign of weakness,” the analyst stated. “In many bull cycles, such corrections and shakeouts serve to flush out over-leveraged positions and reset sentiment, ultimately laying the groundwork for renewed upward momentum.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-break-down/,"BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT",cryptocompare

On-chain data suggests the market may be entering overheated territory soon. Analysts expect either sideways movement or a mild price correction. Bitcoin made headlines in May after breaking its earlier all-time high. On May 21, 2025, it jumped to $110,797, beating its previous record of $109,588 set in January. The very next day, it climbed even higher to $111,980, almost touching $112,000. This move comes after a slow first quarter for the market. Back in early April, Bitcoin was trading around $74,500 during rising US-China trade tensions. Since then, its price has steadily climbed, making a strong recovery. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at$104,820. While Bitcoin has gained over 50% in six weeks, major altcoins Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) haven’t managed to keep up. Even with a 97% bounce from April’s lows, they remain far below their past highs. This has pushed Bitcoin dominance higher, reaching 65% in May 2025, a level last seen in 2021.

With its recent purchase, the company dubbed by many as the Japanese “Strategy” now holds 8,888 BTC which is equal to around $851 million according to market prices at the time of its latest purchase. According to Bitcoin Treasuries’ database , Metaplanet’s recent purchase has made it the 10th largest corporate BTC holder on the leaderboard. However, it still has a long way to go if it wants to catch up to Michael Saylor’s Strategy. Strategy currently occupies the top spot, with 580,250 BTC in total holdings. At press time, Bitcoin has gone up by 0.4% in the past 24 hours. It is currently trading hands at $104,848, noticeably around $4,600 lower than the purchase price Metaplanet opted for. In fact, its 24 hour peak still stood at $105,804.

Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Yields Alongside the recent BTC purchase, Metaplanet provided updates on its BTC Yield metric. BTC Yield is used to calculate the period-over-period percentage ratio between the company’s Bitcoin Holdings and its fully diluted shares outstanding. Throughout 2025, the company’s BTC holdings generated the largest yield percentage during the first quarter of 2025, which ran from January 1 to March 31. During this period, the company saw its BTC Yield amount 95.6%. However, this marked a large departure from its previous BTC Yield at the end of 2024 which jumped as high as 309.8%. On the other hand, the BTC Yield recorded from April 1 to June 2 amounted to only 66.3%. Most recently, the company issued its largest set of 0% ordinary bonds to the venture capital EVO FUND. The bonds were worth a combined value of $50 million. According to the notice, the funds generated from the bond issuances would be used to buy more Bitcoin.

Sell-offs have picked up, and weak market momentum is shaking confidence. As SHIB fades, whales are shifting to new plays. Unilabs is catching that wave. On-chain data shows over $500,000 of its $1.7 million presale came from SHIB holders. That’s a clear signal: seasoned investors want more than hype. Unilabs delivers real utility and passive income, something Shiba Inu coin can’t offer. It’s becoming the smarter choice for those seeking stronger, long-term gains. SHIB’s Price Faces Major Resistance as Whales Go On Selling Spree SHIB’s price keeps sliding, dropping for four days straight and hitting $0.00001238 – its lowest since April 22. That’s a 30% drop from its May high, pushing Shiba Inu coin into a bear market. Bitcoin’s fall from $111,900 to $103,000 hasn’t helped, dragging down overall sentiment. Whales are also pulling back. Large wallets have cut holdings from 743 trillion to 723 trillion Shiba Inu coin since January. This steady sell-off shows falling confidence and adds pressure on SHIB’s price. Source | TradingView Shibarium, the Shiba Inu coin’s layer-2 network, is also underperforming. It holds just $2.92 million in total value, far behind rivals like Unichain with over $600 million. Weak adoption raises doubts about the memecoin’s long-term use, impacting SHIB’s price. The burn rate is fading, too. The biggest burn this week hit just 18 million Shiba Inu coins – a far cry from past billion-token events. With burns slowing, one of the key bullish drivers for SHIB’s price is losing strength. Technicals offer no relief. SHIB’s price broke below its wedge pattern and the 50-day moving average. If buyers don’t step in soon, analysts see a drop to $0.00001033 as likely. Right now, the trend remains bearish for Shiba Inu coin. How is Unilabs Reshaping the Asset Management Industry? Unilabs is changing how asset management works. It fixes a big problem even top firms like Vanguard and BlackRock face – human error. These mistakes cost billions. Unilabs uses AI to cut that risk and make smarter, faster decisions. The shift is bold, and it’s already gaining serious traction. With over $30 million managed, Unilabs splits funds across four smart portfolios: AI, BTC, RWAs, and Mining. Each one runs on algorithms that aim to boost gains while keeping risk in check. The brain behind this setup is EASS.

Conservative investors aren’t left out. The Stablecoin Savings Account lets them earn steady returns through secure stablecoin pools. It’s a simple way to grow crypto holdings without taking on major risk. Over 20k Investors Back Unilabs Unilabs’ token, UNIL, is quickly grabbing attention. Priced at $0.0051, it has already raised over $1.7 million – a big win for a project just weeks old. But there’s more to the buzz than fast money. Some investors are chasing quick gains, expecting a move to $0.0061 soon. Others see the real value in holding for the long term. Unilabs offers more than hype – it pays back. Its model sends 30% of revenue to UNIL holders as dividends, giving users passive income just for holding the token. This approach encourages loyalty and adds steady demand. Investors don’t just hope for price jumps – they earn while they wait. It’s a stock-style model that’s rare in crypto and built for serious returns.

2025-06-02T06:34:55,"Bitcoin ETFs ended six-week inflow streak over macro jitters and BTC slump","Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a notable shift in investor sentiment last week, as uncertainty surrounding Donald Trump’s trade policies and profit-taking led to a reversal in inflow trends. According to SoSoValue data , the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. recorded $157.4 million in outflows over the past week from May 27-30, ending a six-week inflow streak that drew in over $9 billion into the funds. Among the funds hit hardest was ARK 21Shares’ ARKB, which saw $281.9 million pulled by investors. Fidelity’s FBTC wasn’t far behind, recording outflows of $198.8 million. Grayscale’s GBTC and Bitwise’s BITB also took a hit, losing $134.4 million and $104.3 million, respectively. Other funds like Invesco’s BTCO, Franklin Templeton’s EZBC, and VanEck’s HODL recorded a combined $30.3 million in redemptions. Still, it wasn’t entirely bearish across the board. BlackRock’s IBIT managed to offset a significant portion of the outflows with $584.6 million in inflows, indicating that some investors still viewed the pullback as a buying opportunity. Grayscale’s mini BTC fund and Valkyrie’s BRRR also saw modest inflows, helping soften the overall blow. Despite last week’s redemptions, May still ended on a bullish note for Bitcoin ETFs overall. Net inflows totaled around $5.23 billion for the month, up over 75% compared to April’s figure. For context, February and March had seen net outflows of $3.56 billion and $767.91 million, respectively. The rebound in May shows just how much appetite investors still have for BTC, even with short-term market jitters. You might also like: Bitcoin exchange reserves hit an all-time low — is a volatility spike coming? Investor demand for Bitcoin ETFs took a hit last week, partly because traders started locking in profits after BTC’s rally its new all-time high earlier in May. With June historically being a bearish month for Bitcoin in four of the past six years, many likely chose to take some gains off the table ahead of a potential seasonal dip. At the same time, fresh worries on the macro front didn’t help. The ongoing drama around Trump’s trade tariffs resurfaced after two U.S. courts issued conflicting rulings. One ruling declared the tariffs illegal , while the other allowed them to stay in place during the appeal process, which could drag on all the way to the Supreme Court. That kind of uncertainty is keeping some investors on edge. Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has slipped about 4.3% over the past week, briefly dipping to $103,950 on June 2 before bouncing back a bit to around $105,000. Even with the drop, BTC is still just 6.1% off its all-time high of $111,814 from earlier last month. “This pullback is healthy, not signaling outright bearishness but more of a pause and consolidation,” Himanshu Maradiya, founder and chairman of CIFDAQ, told crypto.news. “Overall, this is not a risk-on environment, but also not one to fear. It’s a time for discipline: capital preservation, sharp focus, and readiness to seize opportunities as they arise.” Read more: Top 4 reasons why XRP price may surge 50% in June",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/bitcoin-etfs-ended-six-week-inflow-streak-over-macro-jitters-and-btc-slump/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","News|BlackRock|Cryptocurrency|DeFi",cryptocompare
2025-06-02T06:33:41,"Bitcoin stays over $105K; ‘overheating’ concerns emerge, Hayes forecasts major surge","Bitcoin (BTC) maintained its position above the $105,000 mark as the Asian business week commenced, demonstrating relative stability over the weekend with minimal price movement and compressed trading volumes. While the broader market sentiment remains bullish, a new report from on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant suggests certain metrics are indicating the Bitcoin market might be “overheating,” potentially signaling a near-term consolidation phase. The world’s largest digital asset exhibited a calm weekend, with price fluctuations limited to around 0.4%. However, beneath this surface stability, CryptoQuant’s analysis points to some underlying pressures. The report reveals that Bitcoin demand has surged significantly, reaching 229,000 BTC over the past 30 days. This figure is rapidly approaching the December 2024 peak demand of 279,000 BTC. Concurrently, balances held by “whales” – large Bitcoin holders – have increased by 2.8 percent. Historically, such a pace of accumulation by whales can often signal a slowing down of their buying activity, potentially preceding a market cool-off. These indicators, taken together, suggest that the current rally, which recently propelled Bitcoin prices to a record high of $112,000, may be approaching a short-term peak. The CryptoQuant report identifies $120,000 as the next major resistance level for Bitcoin. This level is tied to the upper band of the Traders’ On-chain Realized Price, a metric indicating a point where unrealized profits for traders would hit 40 percent – a threshold that has historically coincided with local market tops. Despite these cautionary signals, CryptoQuant’s “Bull Score Index” remains robust at 80, indicating continued underlying bullish momentum. Nevertheless, the combination of rising profit margins for existing holders and peaking demand growth suggests that traders might face a period of price consolidation before Bitcoin can embark on its next significant upward move. Arthur Hayes’ audacious prediction: $250K Bitcoin by year-end? Adding a highly bullish counterpoint to the near-term caution, Bitcoin billionaire and BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has forecasted a dramatic surge in Bitcoin’s price. Hayes predicts that Bitcoin will more than double within the next six months, potentially reaching an astonishing $250,000. He attributes this optimistic outlook to an anticipated shift in US President Donald Trump’s fiscal policies, moving away from market-rattling tariffs towards more stimulative measures. “Midterm elections are coming up in the US,” Hayes told Decrypt during an interview at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. While the Trump administration went hard on tariffs and was taking this market pain for the last three months, that narrative has to shift. Hayes, known for his bold market predictions, argued that instead of pursuing trade policies that could dampen economic growth and potentially impact American consumers’ affordability, the president will need to demonstrate that he has “brought goodies for the population.” This, Hayes believes, will be crucial to bolstering Republican prospects at the ballot box in the 2026 midterm elections. The mechanism for this, according to Hayes, will involve a more accommodative monetary stance. “They’re going to accelerate the money printing,” Hayes stated, referring to the Federal Reserve – the independent US government agency primarily responsible for managing the nation’s money supply. Such a scenario, involving increased liquidity, is often seen by crypto proponents as highly bullish for assets like Bitcoin, which are perceived as hedges against currency debasement.

2025-06-02T06:21:20,"France brings charges against 25 in crypto kidnapping conspiracy","French prosecutors have formally charged 25 people, some as young as 16, in connection with a series of attempted kidnappings targeting crypto industry figures and their families. According to local media, the charges follow a string of high-profile abduction plots that have shaken France’s growing digital asset community. The suspects, aged between 16 and 23, are believed to be linked to coordinated efforts to kidnap individuals with ties to cryptocurrency wealth, often using stolen vehicles and fake courier branding to carry out the attacks. Central to the latest indictments is the widely reported May 13 kidnapping attempt in Paris, where masked assailants attacked the daughter and grandson of Paymium CEO Pierre Noizat. The attack took place in the 11th arrondissement in broad daylight and was caught on video, which later circulated online. All three victims sustained minor injuries and were treated at a hospital. Authorities say this incident was part of a wider conspiracy involving other unsuccessful attempts, including a similar plot the day prior and a separate operation near Nantes shortly thereafter. Of the 25 charged, 18 are now in pre-trial detention, four are under judicial supervision, and three have requested delayed hearings. You might also like: Crypto-linked kidnapping cases in France lead to arrests of over 12, including minors The suspects reportedly come from a variety of backgrounds, with many born in the Paris area and others from places including Senegal, Angola, Russia, and Châtellerault. Defence lawyers have characterized some of the accused as vulnerable youths drawn into criminal activity with promises of quick money, unaware of the severity of the crimes. The investigation gained momentum following mass arrests on 27 May, when French police conducted coordinated raids across Île-de-France and Loire-Atlantique. The operations were led by the Brigade de Répression du Banditisme, France’s specialized anti-gang unit, and focused on dismantling a network allegedly behind multiple crypto-related abduction schemes. French officials believe these incidents may be connected to a criminal organization that recruits operatives via social media to carry out high-risk abductions. Investigators say those arrested so far appear to be foot soldiers and logistics handlers, with the masterminds still at large. As previously reported by crypto.news, French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau met with digital asset industry stakeholders in mid-May to discuss security measures.

2025-06-02T06:09:14,"Czech Justice Minister Resigns Over Bitcoin Scandal","This led to an investigation and political fallout just months after the country passed a major pro-crypto law aligned with the EU’s MiCA framework. Meanwhile, Bitcoin maximalist Max Keiser questioned the staying power of new Bitcoin treasury adopters, like Strive and Trump Media. He believes they lack the discipline shown by Strategy's Michael Saylor during bear markets, and warned of potential unsustainable equity premiums. Across the globe, the IMF flagged Pakistan’s decision to allocate 2,000 megawatts for Bitcoin mining and AI data centers, which raised concerns about energy policy and regulatory oversight amid ongoing IMF loan negotiations. Bitcoin Donation Forces Czech Minister to Step Down Czech Justice Minister Pavel Blazek resigned after widespread criticism over his acceptance and subsequent sale of Bitcoin that was donated by a convicted drug trafficker. The controversy began on May 28 when the Justice Ministry announced via social media that it raised close to 1 billion Czech koruna (or approximately $45 million) by auctioning off close to 500 Bitcoin. These funds were intended to support justice system improvements, including digitization, prison reform, and staff housing. Post from the Justice Ministry However, local media soon revealed that the Bitcoin originated from Tomas Jirikovsky, a criminal that was convicted in 2017 for his role in operating Sheep Marketplace, a dark web platform used for trading illegal goods. In March, Jirikovsky’s lawyer approached Blazek with an offer to donate one-third of the Bitcoin he retained after his release from prison in 2021. Blazek accepted the offer without investigating the source of the cryptocurrency, and claimed during a press conference that he had no means to verify the origin and believed the gesture was motivated by a desire to repent. Pavel Blazek The revelation sparked public outcry and drew a lot of criticism from opposition leaders, who accused Blazek of gross negligence. The Czech police also launched an investigation into the origin of the donated Bitcoin. During his trial, authorities already suspected that Jirikovsky’s crypto holdings were connected to another dark web platform, Nucleus, though Jirikovsky insisted the Bitcoin was legally obtained. This allowed him to keep a portion after serving his sentence. Due to the growing political pressure and with national elections on the horizon, Prime Minister Petr Fiala distanced himself from Blazek, which ultimately prompted the minister’s resignation on May 30. Blazek held firm that he committed no wrongdoing but stated he stepped down to avoid damaging the government’s reputation. The scandal happened against the backdrop of a new pro-crypto legislative shift in Czechia. On Feb. 6, President Petr Pavel signed a landmark law regulating digital assets, which aligned the country’s crypto framework with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. The legislation aims to simplify taxation and encourage innovation in the digital asset sector. Max Keiser Questions Bitcoin Treasury Boom Bitcoin also stirred some doubt from maximalist Max Keiser . He voiced skepticism over the durability of newly emerging Bitcoin treasury companies, and questioned whether they can actually maintain the same level of financial discipline as Michael Saylor’s Strategy during a sustained bear market. In a May 30 post on X , Keiser argued that while Saylor famously continued to accumulate Bitcoin through downturns without selling, these newer firms have yet to be tested under similar conditions. He warned that it is “foolish” to assume these so-called Strategy clones will show comparable conviction, and suggested instead that “Strategy is the Bitcoin of BTC treasury plays.” Saylor’s company serves as a model for crypto-aligned treasury management, and attracted a lot of investor interest from both crypto-native and traditional finance circles. Its stock surged to an all-time high of around $543 on Nov. 21, which ended up pushing a wave of companies to mimic its Bitcoin-centric reserve strategy in hopes of achieving similar financial performance and share price appreciation. Bitcoin holdings (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.net ) Analysts now warn that this proliferation of Bitcoin treasury adopters could result in corporations collectively controlling more than half of Bitcoin’s total supply. Among the most recent entrants, asset management firm Strive announced its Bitcoin treasury transition on May 7. Just weeks later, the Trump Media and Technology Group, which is a media firm partially owned by US President Donald Trump, disclosed a massive $2.5 billion capital raise to buy Bitcoin. Another Strategy-inspired company, Metaplanet, saw its shares trade at an implied Bitcoin premium of $600,000, meaning investors are paying nearly six times more for exposure through equity markets than they would by purchasing Bitcoin directly. This growing premium trend is causing concern among market analysts, who warn that such elevated valuations may be unsustainable if market sentiment shifts or if Bitcoin enters a prolonged correction. IMF Flags Pakistan’s Bitcoin Mining Power Plan Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is concerned about Pakistan’s recent decision to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence data centers. The move is part of Pakistan’s broader digital asset strategy, and was made at a time when the country is engaged in sensitive negotiations for an extended financial assistance program with the IMF. According to local news outlet Samaa, the IMF was not consulted prior to the announcement and is now seeking urgent clarification from Pakistan’s Finance Ministry regarding the legality of cryptocurrency mining, the specifics of the electricity allocation, and the broader implications for energy tariffs and national power distribution. Officials suggest that the IMF’s concerns may complicate the ongoing talks, and sources even pointed out that the economic team is already facing intense scrutiny. The IMF delegation currently in virtual discussions with Pakistani officials is expected to convene a separate session to address the country’s plan to power crypto mining and AI operations. Pakistan’s strategy is anchored by the establishment of the Pakistan Digital Asset Authority (PDAA), which was approved by the Finance Ministry on May 21. This authority will oversee regulation of exchanges, wallets, stablecoins, DeFi platforms, and the tokenization of national assets, aligning its mandate with international compliance frameworks like those of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Bilal Bin Saqib at the Bitcoin 2025 conference The announcement also followed Pakistan’s recent unveiling of its first strategic Bitcoin reserve at the Bitcoin 2025 conference. During the event, Bilal bin Saqib, crypto adviser to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, introduced a national Bitcoin wallet. This reflects Pakistan’s shifting stance on cryptocurrencies, which began earlier in 2025 with the proposal of a National Crypto Council to help draft a full regulatory framework and attract international investment.

The comment was made in a video clip attached to the tweet and has drawn attention within both the Cardano and Bitcoin development communities due to its implications for cross-chain compatibility and infrastructure development. In the video, Hoskinson stated that “Cardano is becoming the de facto dev platform for Bitcoin script,” referencing recent technical advancements made under the BitVMX initiative. He emphasized that Cardano’s platform could serve as the initial entry point for developers working with Bitcoin script. According to Hoskinson, BitVMX will continue to evolve and improve, becoming more capable, more efficient, and supported by a growing ecosystem over time. Hoskinson remarked, “What Cardano has effectively done, because of this work, Cardano is becoming the de facto dev platform for Bitcoin script, if you think about that. And that’s an amazing thing. “So, if you’re a Bitcoin developer now, your first entry point can be through BitVMX, and what you know is that over time that platform is going to get more capable, it’s going to get faster, it’s going to get cheaper to utilize, and ultimately it’s going to have a larger ecosystem around it.” JUST IN: #Cardano $ADA Founder Charles Hoskinson says ""Cardano is becoming the de facto dev platform for Bitcoin script.

This model offers deterministic behavior and concurrency advantages that are significant for developers building complex applications. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 While Bitcoin script is known for its simplicity and security, it is also limited in functionality. BitVMX appears to address these limitations by enabling Bitcoin-aligned development within Cardano’s more expressive and scalable environment. Community Endorsement of the Multichain Vision The tweet gained support from members of the crypto developers community. One user, posting under the name T, commented that the cooperation between Bitcoin and Cardano is a meaningful technical innovation. He stated that BitVMX leverages Cardano’s architecture while preserving Bitcoin’s foundational principles. T noted that Cardano’s EUTXO model positions it well for this kind of cross-chain functionality and described the approach as a practical bridge between networks. According to them, BitVMX represents only the initial phase of what could become a broader development trend focused on combining Bitcoin’s security with Cardano’s programmability. Hoskinson Reaffirms Support for Interoperable Infrastructure Charles Hoskinson has previously advocated for multichain cooperation and modular infrastructure in blockchain ecosystems. The remarks regarding BitVMX reinforce that position, suggesting that future development efforts may increasingly focus on interoperability and shared resources between networks, rather than on siloed or isolated ecosystems. As the development of BitVMX progresses and more capabilities are introduced, further interest from Bitcoin developers may follow. The potential for faster and more cost-effective smart contract execution via Cardano’s infrastructure could open up new avenues for Bitcoin-script-based innovation.
