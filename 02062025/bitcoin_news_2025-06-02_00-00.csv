2025-06-01T21:18:07,"Significant Cryptocurrency Bill Unveiled in South Korea – Expected to Pass Easily","The South Korean National Assembly is preparing to take an important step towards the legalization of tokenized securities (Security Tokens, ST). The bill, which is expected to pass after the election, has caused great activity in the financial sector. The country's leading financial institutions are rapidly establishing collaborations and continuing technical infrastructure preparations in order to be pioneers in this new market. Tokenized securities are known as digital securities supported by blockchain technology. Thanks to the security and ease of transaction offered by this technology, it is possible to divide low-liquid assets such as real estate, works of art, and even live animals into small shares and offer them to investors. Currently, tokenized securities remain in a gray area due to a lack of regulation. However, both main candidates running in the presidential election, Lee Jae-myung and Kim Moon-soo, have made it clear in their campaign promises that tokenized securities will be legalized quickly, making the bill’s passage almost certain. Related News: Michael Saylor Gives Another Bullish Signal That He Will Buy Bitcoin: Here's How Much BTC He Currently Owns The fact that tokenized securities are both based on real assets and have the status of a security has led to a serious consensus among political parties in this area. This makes it easier for the law to pass. According to industry representatives, this digital asset class is seen as “the safest innovation.” With the passing of the law, an increase in tokenized investment products based on familiar assets such as real estate is expected in the short term. In the long term, it is predicted that the market structure will change radically as traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds, become tokenized. These blockchain-based digital securities promise to lower transaction costs by reducing dependence on centralized intermediary institutions, while enabling automatic transactions powered by artificial intelligence thanks to their programmability. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-01T21:03:00,"Majority of Crypto Users Start With Meme Coins Before Expanding Portfolios: Gemini Report","Over the last year, meme coins have garnered significant attention in the space, attracting high trading volumes and generating returns of several thousand percent in a matter of hours in some cases, despite being highly controversial. These often-viral assets are doing more than just making headlines. Meme Coins Spark Broader Crypto Participation According to the latest report titled “State of Crypto” by Winklevoss twins-led crypto exchange Gemini, meme coins are encouraging newcomers to explore the digital asset industry. This was found after conducting a survey of 7,205 consumers in the US, UK, France, Italy, Singapore, and Australia (approximately 1,200) consumers per country. A large majority – a whopping 94% – of meme coin holders also hold other types of cryptocurrencies, suggesting that meme coins act as a bridge into the broader crypto ecosystem. Many users appear to begin their journey with these tokens before branching out. For example, 31% of US investors who own both meme coins and traditional cryptocurrencies say meme coins were their first crypto purchase. That trend is similarly reflected in Australia and the UK, which trailed with 28% each, followed by Singapore with 23%, Italy with 22%, and France with 19%. Interestingly, France also leads in overall meme coin ownership, with 67% of its crypto investors holding at least one. The trend continues across other regions with Singapore at 59%, Italy at 58%, the UK at 57%, the US at 55%, and Australia at 45%. Europe Leads Crypto Ownership Zooming out, crypto ownership has grown steadily across multiple regions following the 2022 market downturn. Europe reported a notable rise. In 2025, 24% of UK respondents said they owned cryptocurrency, up from 18% in 2024. France saw a similar rise, with ownership increasing to 21%, also from 18% the previous year. Analysts attribute this growth in part to a more favorable regulatory climate in Europe, driven by the phased rollout of the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework over the last two years. Singapore recorded the highest rate of crypto ownership among the surveyed countries, with 28% of respondents reporting they hold digital assets. In the United States, President Donald Trump’s recent crypto-friendly policies are also influencing public sentiment. After vowing to support digital assets during his campaign, Trump has launched a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, restructured the SEC toward a more innovation-driven stance, and backed legislation aimed at regulating stablecoins and broader crypto markets. Additionally, he introduced a Trump-branded meme coin, which reached nearly $3 billion in market cap this month. These developments appear to be boosting confidence among potential investors. Nearly 23% of non-crypto owners in the US said the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve made them more confident in crypto’s value. Trump’s initiatives are having an international ripple effect on attitudes toward digital asset investment, as 21% of non-crypto owners in the UK and 19% in Singapore echoed a similar sentiment.

2025-06-01T20:58:48,"Elon Musk said X is launching XChat with Bitcoin-style encryption","Elon Musk announced on Sunday through a post on X that the platform is rolling out an entirely new messaging tool called XChat. According to Elon, the new feature includes end-to-end encryption, disappearing messages, support for any file type, and cross-platform audio and video calling without requiring a phone number. He said it’s built in Rust, powered by “Bitcoin-style encryption”, and developed with an entirely new system framework. The feature works across all devices and doesn’t need a SIM card or cellular number to function, which is a huge departure from the way rivals like WhatsApp and Telegram tie accounts to phone numbers. Elon’s approach is built for anonymity, portability, and multi-platform access without depending on mobile carriers. New system uses Bitcoin-grade encryption but faces quantum risk Elon’s reference to “Bitcoin-style encryption” is tied to elliptic curve cryptography, or ECC. This encryption method is what Bitcoin uses to protect transactions and digital signatures. The reason it’s used is because it offers strong protection with far smaller key sizes than older methods like RSA. A 256-bit ECC key can provide similar security to a 3072-bit RSA key, making it faster and less demanding on memory or bandwidth. ECC works based on the math of elliptic curves over finite fields, allowing it to handle key agreements, digital signatures, and encryption through a structure that’s tough to break using traditional computing. But researchers are raising new concerns about how long ECC will actually stay safe. It was once thought that breaking ECC with a quantum computer would take an insane amount of resources, but recent breakthroughs show that it could actually be cracked 20 times faster than originally believed. That brings up questions about how secure XChat will be in a few years when quantum machines mature. The problem lies in what’s called the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem, which ECC relies on. If a system could reverse that problem quickly, like a quantum computer might, it would make it easier to break into encrypted conversations or spoof digital signatures. For now, it’s still a solid cryptographic standard, but the clock is ticking on how futureproof it really is. Cryptographic structure inside XChat built around elliptic curve protocols XChat’s security system appears to use a mix of ECC-based schemes. One is the Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) protocol, which helps both users create a shared private key without ever sending it across the internet. Then there’s ECIES, which is what handles the actual message encryption using that shared key. Together, they make sure messages stay private from end to end. For verifying who’s sending what, XChat could use ECDSA, the same digital signature method Bitcoin uses. There are also advanced options like EdDSA, which uses a different type of curve known as twisted Edwards curves and also allow for faster and more secure signature verification, which would come in handy for large-scale messaging apps. The system is also capable of handling things like ECMQV, which is a more secure key agreement scheme designed to block fake users from getting in the middle of conversations. And there’s even a possibility XChat might support ECQV implicit certificates, which allow user identities to be confirmed without needing a big centralized public key infrastructure. That kind of system could reduce reliance on big certificate authorities while still giving users verified encryption. All these encryption tools are centered around one idea: you can multiply a number with a point on a curve, but you can’t figure out what the number was just by looking at the result. It sounds simple, but the math is complicated enough that even the best computers in the world can’t brute-force it… well at least not yet. XChat’s codebase is written in Rust, a programming language that’s popular among developers building secure systems. Rust reduces memory-related bugs and is considered safer than older options like C++. Combined with the smaller key sizes and lower power consumption of ECC, that makes XChat optimized for both mobile and desktop use. Whether this setup will hold against quantum attacks is still unknown. But it sure would be interesting to live through regardless. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-06-01T20:53:07,"A Massive Amount of Mysterious BTC Was Transferred to Ross Ulbricht, Who Lost All His Bitcoin to the US Government – What Does This Mean?","Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht is back in the spotlight for the first time since he was released from custody following a presidential pardon in January. Released after 11 years in prison, Ulbricht auctioned off his personal belongings four months later and soon received a mysterious Bitcoin transfer worth millions of dollars. Several of Ulbricht’s personal belongings, including ID cards from his prison years, a blank rehabilitation notebook and oil paintings he made while in prison, were put up for sale on the Bitcoin-based auction platform Scarce City. The auction raised a total of 12.31 BTC, or about $1.3 million at current prices. The highest bid was Ulbricht’s last prison ID card, issued just months before his release. It sold for 5.5 BTC (around $600,000). Ulbricht said that a guard asked him not to smile during his ID photoshoot, but he smiled anyway: “My joy comes from within, so I smiled that day, even though I was in prison.” Related News: One of the Big Names in the Cryptocurrency Industry Allegedly on the Brink of Bankruptcy: Rapid Denial from the Company Immediately following the auction, a single transaction of 300 BTC (approximately $31 million) was made to a donation wallet linked to Ulbricht. This large transfer was spotted by Lookonchain and confirmed to have been transferred to Ulbricht’s donation wallet by Arkham Intelligence data. Some commentators suggested that this transaction might not have been a genuine donation at all, but a self-transfer from wallets Ulbricht had access to before his arrest in 2013. More than 2.6 BTC were previously donated to Ulbricht in January, the day he was pardoned by President Donald Trump, in over 170 transactions. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-01T20:41:00,"This $0.07 XRP Alternative Could Surge To Over $5 If The Bitcoin Price Hits $150,000 In 2025","Analysts have outlined bold projections for Remittix (RTX), suggesting that if the Bitcoin price hits $150,000, then the XRP alternative is on track to reach $5. Supporting these claims is Remittix’s real-world utility, presale momentum and strong fundamentals. Remittix is filling the gap XRP left behind by offering innovative solutions to the challenges in global payments. As Bitcoin forms an accumulation launchpad to break its all-time high, all eyes are on this PayFi sensation for explosive returns. Let’s delve deeper! Remittix (RTX): XRP alternative with practical solutions Source: Remittix XRP has been in the front seat in blockchain payments for a long time. Yet with its regulatory concerns and institutional hurdles, many are wondering whether it is still the frontrunner in 2025. In the meantime, Remittix is stepping up by providing a retail-oriented model that gives quick, low-fee crypto-to-fiat payments. While Ripple is focusing on large institutions, Remittix is targeting individuals, freelancers, and businesses involved in global payments. Currently, the Remittix PayFi infrastructure supports instant settlement in more than 30 fiat currencies with easy API integration for merchants worldwide. Trading at $0.0781, Remittix is still in its early stages, but the numbers are already sizable. The project has raised over $15.4 million in presale funding, selling more than 539 million tokens. This impressive performance shows investor confidence, driven by practical solutions, which is cementing its place in the high upside potential conversation. Analysts predict Remittix to reach $5 post-launch, especially if adoption continues at this pace. Early investors have already received more than 400% returns, with crypto pundits calling Remittix the “real-world” version Ripple promised but fell short of delivering. XRP price flashes bearish signals as investors search for higher upside alternatives XRP’s price performance continues to frustrate investors as it flirts with crucial support zones. Despite an earlier breakout in May, the token is now stuck in a narrow range, with the bullish trend weakening fast. Amid this adverse momentum, XRP’s on-chain data shows that a significant chunk of XRP’s circulating supply was acquired at or near its recent price peak. Glassnode data reports that over 70% of XRP’s realized market capitalization was accumulated between late 2024 and early 2025, when XRP rallied to nearly $3.40. Source: Glassnode This setup typically indicates a sharp sell-off for XRP as it shows serious profit-taking actions happening behind the scenes. Adding to these concerns, XRP appears to be breaking down from a bearish flag-like structure that formed after a classic cup-and-handle pattern. Bitcoin price enters accumulation phase for next markup After the Bitcoin price rallied to a new all-time high, it entered a consolidation phase. But unlike XRP, industrial experts believe this is a launchpad for BTC’s next major rally. Notably, the breakout above the upper trendline of its flag confirms the continuation of the prior bullish trend. This pattern indicates strong bullish control, often leading to a second leg up that is roughly equal in length to the flagpole. Source: TradingView Adding to the fire, open interest in BTC futures has also hit an all-time high of $76.06 billion. This record-breaking figure, accompanied by BTC’s soaring price action, reflects heightened market participation and optimism. Conclusion The clock’s already ticking for XRP investors as Bitcoin readies to enter its next bull run. Meanwhile, accumulating Remittix at $0.0781 is a no-brainer with its rare utility, priming it for an explosive run.

2025-06-01T20:30:37,"44 Million XRP Tokens Vanish From Turkish Exchange In One Big Transfer","A stunning movement of XRP has just been recorded, with 44.1 million tokens, worth over $97 million at current market price, transferred from Turkish crypto exchange Paribu to an unknown wallet. The sudden move, initially flagged by an XRP investor known as Xaif on social media platform X, comes amid a projected wave of a giga pump forecasted by technical analysts conflicted by waning bullish sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency. 44 Million XRP Leaves Paribu For Unknown Wallet On May 31, 2025, at precisely 09:51 AM UTC, a transaction involving 44,100,000 XRP was executed on the XRP Ledger. The source was identified as Paribu, one of Turkey’s most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges. This makes the source even more interesting, considering it isn’t one of the more popular Western-based crypto exchanges. Nonetheless, the tokens were moved to wallet address “rKeWg9,” which is not previously associated with any major exchange or custodian. Blockchain data confirms that the entire amount was delivered successfully, with a transaction fee of just 0.00001 XRP. As noted by the XRP analyst, this is most likely a message from a giant investor, pointing to an accumulation move. This is is because a significant movement of crypto tokens off an exchange platform is mostly viewed as a sign of long-term holding that reduces selling pressure. When high-volume transfers like this are made, they are mostly purchases by institutions or high-net-worth individuals positioning themselves ahead of a bigger price shift. In a market where sentiment can change quickly, such moves carry psychological weight. As expected, it has caused some optimism among smaller holders, and the next outlook is whether it can attract more buyers expecting a rally. Giga Pump Incoming For XRP? Adding to the building fire is a bold proclamation from market analyst Amonyx, who recently took to X to share an ultra-bullish outlook for XRP. Particularly, the analyst noted that XRP is on the way to printing a “giga pump” into the foreseeable long term. The chart he shared shows a long-term symmetrical triangle breakout pattern, indicating that XRP has finally broken past a multi-year consolidation phase on the monthly candlestick timeframe, which dates back to 2018. The resemblance of this breakout to Bitcoin’s similar breakout in 2016 is unmistakable. Considering the subsequent Bitcoin price action at the time, the analyst projected a similar move for the XRP price. Amonyx’s chart outlines an upside Fibonacci extension target above $27.16, with a more extreme resistance band around $71.41, implying a high-momentum move on the macro level. Both of these levels correspond to the 1.618 and 1.902 Fib extension levels, respectively. The trajectory, if sustained, would see XRP competing with Ethereum and possibly even Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization.

2025-06-01T20:01:09,"Latest Rumor Could Spark Massive Bitcoin and XRP Price Rally On Monday","A post from crypto commentator Bitcoin for Freedom (@BTC_for_Freedom) on X has triggered renewed speculation across digital asset markets. The account claimed that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will resign on Monday. The post concluded with a bold prediction of the future of digital assets. In a follow-up , he reaffirmed a $1 million Bitcoin price target for 2025. Powell’s Stance on Monetary Policy The rumor arrives at a pivotal time for U.S. monetary policy and crypto regulation. Powell, whose current term runs through May 2026, has historically resisted political pressure, including recent calls from President Trump to lower interest rates. His stance has often placed him at odds with pro-crypto advocates who argue that tight monetary policy stifles digital asset growth. While he does not see cryptocurrencies as a stability concern for the U.S., many in the crypto space do not appreciate his approach to inflation and interest rates. The Federal Reserve’s series of rate hikes from 2022 through 2024 contributed to a broader risk-averse sentiment, weighing on speculative assets including Bitcoin and XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Why Hasn’t Trump Fired Powell? Powell has maintained his commitment to central bank independence. He resisted speculation that he would yield to political shifts following Trump’s return to office. Despite the resignation of other key officials such as former SEC Chair Gary Gensler , Powell had previously indicated he would remain in his role and fulfill his term. He emphasized that the Federal Reserve’s independence “is a matter of law,” reinforcing the idea that he could not be removed without cause. This resistance led to speculation on ways Trump could remove him from his position without directly firing him. Potential Impact of Powell’s Resignation If the rumor of Powell’s resignation proves accurate, the implications for the crypto space could be substantial. Trump has already signaled a strong pro-crypto posture, most notably through the appointment of Paul Atkins , also known for his crypto-friendly views, as SEC Chair. A vacancy at the Fed would present the opportunity to appoint a central bank leader who favors lower interest rates and a more accommodative monetary policy. Such a shift could act as a powerful catalyst for digital assets. Investors often interpret lenient monetary policy as supportive of risk-friendly environments, where assets like XRP thrive. Trump’s administration has brought many positive changes. He initiated the conclusion of multiple crypto-related lawsuits, including the XRP lawsuit, which is nearing an official settlement . A new Chair with a softer stance on inflation and a willingness to tolerate increased liquidity could reinforce bullish momentum in the crypto market, giving XRP and other U.S.-based assets a major boost.

Analyst Justin Bennett tells his 115,000 followers on the social media platform X that BTC’s retracement will likely drive traders to believe that the bull market is over. According to the analyst, he expects Bitcoin to correct below $100,000 before it ignites a fresh leg up en route to $120,000. “This is the part where everyone gets super bearish, expecting a 2021-style macro top. It’s also probably where overly aggressive shorts get rekt. 1. The run-up isn’t even close to the same 2. The backdrop couldn’t be more different 3. I doubt they make it this easy.” Source: Justin Bennett/X In 2021, Bitcoin attempted but failed to take out resistance at $69,000 twice, triggering a bear market that sent BTC to bear market lows of $16,000. As for Bennett’s downside target for BTC, he thinks Bitcoin may bounce at $100,000 or $97,000. “BTC next leg down confirmed. 104,800 flips to key resistance. Support is $100,000. Same outlook for the last nine days.” Source: Justin Bennett/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $104,439. Looking at the broader crypto market, the analyst says he’s keeping an eye on the TOTAL chart, which tracks the total market cap of all digital assets. Bennett believes that TOTAL will correct and find support at $3.04 trillion, which aligns with his expected BTC pullback. “I could be wrong. I’m certainly not always right. However, I’m not sure how some are interpreting this as bullish. Things can change, but right now, sellers are in control.” Source: Justin Bennett/X A bearish TOTAL chart indicates that investors are unloading their crypto holdings.

2025-06-01T19:06:01,"Tron (TRX) Price Recovery Backed by Sharp Drop in VaR and Beta","Tron TRX has maintained strong stability during a period of widespread market turbulence. The tenth-largest cryptocurrency has consistently traded above $0.26 for over two weeks and has managed to retain this level even as global trade tensions rise. This growth amid broader market volatility is supported by a marked decline in key risk metrics. TRX – A Safer Bet? Recent analysis indicates that Tron’s Value at Risk (VaR) has decreased significantly in the past few months. This metric, which measures the potential for losses at a 95% confidence level, now points to a more stable and less risky investment profile, according to CryptoQuant. The simultaneous drop in VaR during a period of price recovery highlighted Tron’s strengthening position in the market. In addition, TRX’s daily rolling Beta against Bitcoin has also declined notably. A lower Beta means that TRX is becoming less sensitive to Bitcoin’s price movements, which essentially suggests a reduced correlation and improved independence from broader market swings. Such a decoupling indicates a shift toward a more mature and stable asset. Together, the lower VaR and Beta metrics suggest that Tron is not only recovering in price but doing so with reduced volatility and systemic risk. “This powerful combination – price appreciation alongside reduced risk and market correlation – positions Tron as an increasingly attractive asset. It highlights a maturing ecosystem and a more robust foundation for future performance.” Stablecoins Pour Into Tron, Drain From Ethereum The current bullish signal in the Tron ecosystem has been building gradually as market participants shifted toward the asset. Lookonchain’s analysis recently revealed that the Tron network has seen a significant inflow of stablecoins, with USDT and USDC balances collectively increasing by $2.12 billion in a span of seven days. On the other hand, the Ethereum network experienced an outflow as stablecoin balances dropped by $2.44 billion over the same period. This divergence highlighted a growing shift in user preference and capital allocation toward Tron, which is likely driven by its lower transaction fees and faster settlement speeds. The development also marked a shift in stablecoin activity as liquidity moved away from Ethereum to Tron. The increased adoption is likely one of the price catalysts playing out on the market now.

By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $105,047 (+0.5%) Market cap $2.19 Trillion Trading volume (24-hour) $56.76 Billion (-38%) Circulating supply 19.86 Million BTC All-time high $111,970; May 22, 2025 All-time low $0.04865; Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $105,327.30 24-hour low $103,826.96 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $105,047 Price Prediction $ 114,923 (11.15%) Fear & Greed Index 50 (Neutral) Sentiment Neutral Volatility 4.71% Green Days 16/30 (53%) 50-Day SMA $ 98,083 200-Day SMA $ 86,943 14-Day RSI 50.28 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin faced a minor upward correction toward $105K.

BTC/USDT Chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $103,050, beginning a bearish trend to $100,443. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value.

It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin up today? Bitcoin faced a surge in bullish pressure as buyers defended further declines. This pushed the BTC price toward $105K. Will the BTC price reach $100K?

Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Following the US, Pakistan announced its first government-backed strategic bitcoin reserve, marking a notable step towards adding crypto assets into its financial strategy. Bitcoin price prediction June 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance was notably weak, with a 12.5% loss, as per CoinGlass data, marking the worst first quarter since 2018. However, it made a strong comeback in Q2 as in the last few weeks of May, the price of Bitcoin made a new ATH at $111,970. Will Bitcoin continue its upward rally in June? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $113,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $97,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 $97,000 $105,000 $113,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20.

Fast-forward to May 30, when he took to his X page to reiterate his commitment to ensuring that the country moves towards the strategic Bitcoin reserve. Ireland to Learn From El Salvador’s Bitcoin Strategy In the said post, McGregor pledged a “decentralised blueprint for sovereignty,” citing Germany’s decision to “dropped the ball.” He plans to ensure that Ireland does not follow suit, forgoing the vision of a Bitcoin treasury. Ireland will borrow a leaf or two from El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy playbook based on its statement . “I want to build on the amazing feats president @nayibbukele has achieved in El Salvador,” he hinted, while subtly extending an invitation to the president of the country. “Let’s chat.” McGregor had earlier stated that establishing an Irish strategic Bitcoin reserve is a step towards returning control to the people.

However, it faced opposition when the International Monetary Fund (IMF) refused to loan it some funds because of its Bitcoin stance. The IMF demanded that El Salvador put a stop to its Bitcoin acquisition. Just when it seemed that El Salvador was about to adhere to the agency’s restrictions, the Central American country added 19 BTC to its holdings in March 2025. Since then, the government has continued to purchase the firstborn coin. Pakistan Plans For a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Pakistan is also mulling the idea of establishing its bag regarding a Bitcoin strategic reserve. A post was shared on X on May 29, affirming that the Pakistani government will create a national Bitcoin wallet to store its reserves safely. The holdings will be for long-term investment, which will not be sold. This brewing stance is also drawing the attention of the IMF, which has not failed to express its stance on Bitcoin reserves.

2025-06-01T17:38:55,"Top Trader Reveals Notable XRP Buy Signal, States His Best Entry Level","Despite optimism in the broader crypto market, one leading analyst is holding off on accumulating XRP, citing a key signal that must first materialize. Daniel Liu, a respected market commentator known for his work under the VirtualBacon alias, believes XRP is still lacking the final condition that would make it a compelling buy. In a detailed analysis shared in his May 30 video update, Liu addressed XRP’s recent underperformance and explained why the ongoing consolidation phase may be constructive for the asset in the long term. However, he made it clear that he is still waiting for a major confirmation before reentering. My buy signal for $XRP is a further 20 percent drop against $BTC . This would either come from XRP falling while BTC holds, or from BTC rallying while XRP stays flat. Both cases push XRP into a strong value range. It’s a mid-cycle pattern we’ve seen before, and it often… pic.twitter.com/PAtLo49Cq4 — VirtualBacon (@VirtualBacon0x) May 30, 2025 A 22% Retracement Could Trigger Liu’s Buy Signal Liu pointed to XRP’s recent 37% decline from its January high as a normal pattern for strong-performing altcoins that surged early in the bull cycle. These coins, he said, typically correct against Bitcoin as the cycle progresses. He anticipates XRP will resume outperforming Bitcoin but not until it undergoes another 22% correction. According to Liu, “The XRP/BTC ratio chart will retrace 22% if Bitcoin stays steadily above $100,000 and XRP corrects 22% against the dollar.” Under this scenario, XRP could fall to around $1.85, a price he identified as his optimal entry point. Liu added that $1.85 is the lowest value he expects for XRP in the current cycle. He also noted that XRP has already tested its demand zone seven times since December, each time rebounding strongly. That zone, he suggested, is becoming increasingly reliable as a support level. Alternative Path to Liu’s Buy Trigger Liu also proposed a second path that could trigger the same XRP/BTC retracement. In this case, XRP would remain mostly flat around its current price, while Bitcoin would rally another 22% to reach new highs. The net result would still be a 22% decline in XRP’s ratio to Bitcoin. Liu argued that in such a scenario, many investors may lose confidence in XRP’s ability to outperform. He commented, “Market users took a similar position against Solana and Ethereum a few months back, only for the assets to stun them with face-melting rallies.” This kind of disbelief, he implied, often precedes significant upside. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Only after this retracement—whether through a direct XRP correction or a Bitcoin-led divergence—would Liu consider XRP a strong buy relative to Bitcoin. Until then, he is remaining cautious. Bullish Outlooks Remain While Liu’s strategy is conservative, other analysts remain firmly bullish. Notably, Peter Brandt has called XRP “everyone’s favorite.” Within the XRP community, several prominent figures have issued ambitious price targets for the asset. Researcher SMQKE recently predicted that XRP could surpass Ethereum in market value this year, a move that would imply a rally to at least $6. Meanwhile, analyst Egrag Crypto has outlined targets of $13 and even $22 for XRP, referencing a “bullish engulfing” pattern on the yearly chart. He added that he expects a strong “13th candle performance” for XRP during this market cycle. Although there is growing enthusiasm for XRP’s long-term potential, Daniel Liu’s current stance highlights the importance of timing and market positioning. His forecast suggests that while XRP may ultimately experience a powerful rally, a specific retracement—either through a direct price drop or a Bitcoin surge—is needed to confirm a low-risk, high-reward entry point. Until that condition is met, Liu is not ready to call XRP a buy. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Pete Rizzo, host of the Supply Shock podcast, described the prospect as “THE BITCOIN PODCAST OF THE CENTURY.” BREAKING: BILLIONAIRE MICHAEL SAYLOR JUST FORMALLY ASKED TO GO ON THE JOE ROGAN PODCAST THE #BITCOIN PODCAST OF THE CENTURY. IT'S HAPPENING 🔥 pic.twitter.com/cDja5KA6Lu — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) May 31, 2025 Saylor’s public outreach is a strategic move to reach Rogan’s massive audience, which spans millions of listeners across multiple platforms. The Joe Rogan Experience consistently ranks among the world’s most popular podcasts. It also offers major reach for discussing complex topics like cryptocurrency. A conversation between Saylor and Rogan would likely cover fundamental Bitcoin ( BTC ) concepts. And Saylor’s expertise in explaining Bitcoin’s value proposition in accessible terms could prove valuable for listeners unfamiliar with cryptocurrency fundamentals. You might also like: Crypto VC funding: $161m floods startups as token prices sway Why it matters Saylor has been one of the most vocal corporate advocates for Bitcoin adoption. Strategy also holds over $60 billion worth of the cryptocurrency. During a recent CNBC interview , Saylor highlighted his vision for the crypto industry and stressed the need for clear regulatory definitions of four distinct asset classes. Saylor advocated for legal frameworks that would distinguish between digital commodities like Bitcoin, digital currencies such as regulated stablecoins, digital securities including tokenized stocks, and digital tokens that could serve as utility instruments for businesses. Saylor stressed that proper regulatory clarity could unlock the industry’s massive growth potential. He also suggested that clearly defined categories would allow the sector to expand by factors of 100 or even 1,000. Rogan has previously shown interest in cryptocurrency topics, though he has not yet featured a dedicated Bitcoin-focused episode with a major industry figure. In 2023, the comedian called Bitcoin the most “fascinating” cryptocurrency and a top contender to become a universal viable currency. Rogan also praised Bitcoin’s limited supply and decentralized mining as key strengths. OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman, Rogan’s guest at the time, agreed.

2025-06-01T17:15:16,"Polkadot Ran Strong in 2021 But Qubetics Is Being Counted Among Top Crypto Asset Picks in 2025","What if you could go back and invest in Bitcoin in 2010, Ethereum in 2016, or Polkadot in 2020? Chances are, you’d do it in a heartbeat. But in the fast-moving world of crypto, these moments don’t knock twice. The frustration of missing out on life-changing returns is familiar to many. If you’re still searching for the next big win, then it’s time to pay attention. There’s one name being echoed across crypto circles in 2025 — Qubetics . Qubetics is fast emerging as a top crypto asset, and its momentum is impossible to ignore. Built to eliminate one of blockchain’s most notorious bottlenecks — interoperability — Qubetics brings a unified solution that enhances data flow and decentralized utility across networks. Its current presale has created serious buzz among savvy investors, who understand what’s at stake: a real shot at joining a next-generation protocol before its mainnet hits in Q2 2025. With rapid stage changes and discounted pricing, urgency isn’t optional — it’s essential. Qubetics Is Building Momentum as a Top Crypto Asset — Don’t Miss This Stage Missing Qubetics ’ earliest phases is a decision many regret. When the $TICS presale kicked off in September 2024, investors had access to tokens at just $0.01. That window is gone — and so are multiple low-cost stages that offered unbelievable ROI potential. Still, this top crypto asset hasn’t escaped affordability just yet. Qubetics is currently in Stage 36 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.3064. The project has already secured over $17.5 million in funding, with more than 514 million tokens sold and a growing holder base of 27,300+ — clear signs that momentum is building fast for this top crypto asset. With only seven days between each stage and a 10% price hike as stages progress, the urgency to act is palpable. Investors can still secure a 10% discount at the current price before the next shift. At the current rate, $2,000 gets you 6,528 $TICS tokens. If the token hits $1 post-presale, that equates to $6,528 — a 226.32% ROI. But the real excitement builds when projecting post-mainnet prices. At $5, it becomes $32,640 (1,531.58% ROI). If Qubetics climbs to $10, you’re looking at $65,280 (3,163.16% ROI). And if it hits $15? You’re staring at $97,920 — a whopping 4,794.74% return. These projections are not just promising, they’re transformative for early participants in this top crypto asset . The core strength of Qubetics lies in its real-world application. One of its most impressive utilities is interoperability — solving a crucial pain point in blockchain. Most blockchains operate in silos, unable to communicate seamlessly. Qubetics integrates networks like Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin under a singular framework, enabling asset transfers, smart contract executions, and cross-platform operations without friction. For businesses, this means supply chain systems on different blockchains can exchange data securely and in real-time. For developers, it translates to wider market reach and app functionality across multiple chains. And for users, it’s the difference between fragmented experiences and cohesive engagement across DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise-grade dApps. This isn’t theoretical — it’s already being built. Polkadot Had Its Moment, But the Spotlight in 2025 Belongs to Others Polkadot took the crypto world by storm in 2021 with a unique vision for interoperability. Launched through a highly anticipated ICO at just $0.29, the asset reached an all-time high of $55.09 — delivering astronomical returns for early believers. The DOT ecosystem gained popularity for its parachain auctions and scalable multi-chain infrastructure, earning it a top-tier position among layer-0 protocols. By 2022, institutional money and individual investors alike had their sights set on Polkadot, which quickly became a darling in the decentralized tech movement. However, much of that explosive growth is now history. While DOT continues to be a respected player in the interoperability space, it’s no longer the lone innovator. The crypto landscape of 2025 demands more: seamless user experiences, broader integration capabilities, and sustainable tokenomics. Polkadot’s early-mover advantage gave rise to impressive milestones, but new projects — ones with clearer utility and better strategic positioning — are stealing the limelight. Today, investors are no longer just chasing name recognition; they’re chasing relevance. And that’s shifting attention toward newer entrants with superior execution and opportunity. The Verdict: Qubetics and the Rise of a New Top Crypto Asset The world of crypto doesn’t reward hesitation — it rewards insight backed by action. Qubetics is earning its reputation not just as another presale, but as a top crypto asset with utility, vision, and community-driven potential. With its presale in full swing and a mainnet on the near horizon, this isn’t just a concept — it’s an emerging standard. And while Polkadot’s 2021 run was unforgettable, 2025 is shaping up to be the year Qubetics commands the spotlight. Those seeking the next major opportunity should consider this a strong call to action. This is the time to join this top crypto presale while the numbers still make sense and the ROI potential remains exponential. Crypto doesn’t pause, and Qubetics isn’t waiting either. The next phase is always just seven days away — are you ready for it?

2025-06-01T17:00:08,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) Likely Price if Bitcoin Hits $4.87 Million by 2040","The possibility of Bitcoin reaching $4.87 million by 2040 is drawing attention not only for its implications on BTC itself but also for the potential impact on other digital assets. One such asset is Shiba Inu (SHIB), which has demonstrated a notable correlation with Bitcoin’s price action since its inception. If Bitcoin sees this predicted level of growth, Shiba Inu could also experience significant appreciation in value. SHIB and Bitcoin Price Action Correlation Recent data highlights Shiba Inu’s close alignment with Bitcoin in terms of price action. Over the past 30 days, the token has shown a correlation coefficient of 0.72 with Bitcoin, according to analytics from IntoTheBlock . In about 60 days, this correlation reached 0.86, indicating a stronger connection between the two cryptocurrencies. This high degree of correlation means Shiba Inu often mirrors Bitcoin’s market movements, sometimes with amplified effects. For example, a modest increase in Bitcoin’s price may result in a greater percentage gain for SHIB. Therefore, a dramatic increase in Bitcoin’s price could serve as a strong catalyst for Shiba Inu (SHIB). Projected Value of SHIB if Bitcoin Reaches $4.87 Million A recent forecast from analysts at cryptocurrency platform Changelly places Bitcoin’s average price at approximately $4.87 million by January 2040. This figure represents a 4,400% increase compared to its current price of around $105,000. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Using this projection as a benchmark, ChatGPT applied the same percentage increase to Shiba Inu’s current value. If SHIB were to follow a similar growth trajectory, its price could reach approximately $0.000632. With its circulating supply remaining at around 589.25 trillion, this implies a market capitalization of $372.4 billion, up from its current market cap of $8.27 billion. Additional Forecasts from Grok AI Another artificial intelligence model, Grok, incorporated predictions from various sources, such as CoinCodex, Changelly, Coinpedia Markets, and Telegaon, to develop a more comprehensive outlook for Shiba Inu by 2040. According to Grok’s analysis, SHIB may trade within a conservative range of $0.00001911 to $0.054 by 2040. The AI model also proposed a mid-range price forecast between $0.00002157 and $0.076, while offering a highly optimistic scenario in which Shiba Inu could trade between $0.0000310 and $0.089. These projections consider not only SHIB’s correlation with Bitcoin but also potential internal developments , such as token burns, growth within the ecosystem, and favourable market sentiment. Despite these promising forecasts, Grok emphasized the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. While historical data and correlations provide useful insights, long-term predictions remain speculative and subject to numerous variables. Shiba Inu’s future may hinge significantly on both broader market conditions and its ecosystem developments.

Georgia-based LexisNexis Risk Solutions (LNRS) says 364,333 customers are affected, according to a new filing with the Office of the Maine Attorney General. The firm says an unknown attacker breached the systems of a third-party platform that LexisNexis uses, exposing various customer data, including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, postal details, Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers. “On April 1st, 2025, we learned that on December 25th, 2024, an unauthorized third party acquired certain LNRS data from a third-party platform used for software development. The issue did not affect LNRS’s own networks or systems.” LexisNexis is a global data and analytics firm that helps companies manage risks, enhance compliance, prevent fraud and improve operational efficiency. The firm says it promptly sent letters to affected customers to provide more information on the security incident while offering free credit monitoring and identity protection services for 24 months. For now, LexisNexis says it is taking steps to review and revamp its security protocols to avoid a potential repeat of the incident. The firm is also urging customers to be on the lookout for any suspicious activity that may indicate fraud or identity theft.

In fact, the last three years have seen a 1000% increase in the money lost to scammers via Bitcoin ATMs. 30,000 Unregulated Bitcoin ATMs in the US Bitcoin ATMs resemble traditional ATMs but are designed to accept cash in exchange for digital assets. Once this action is completed, the converted money in digital currencies is transferred to a designated crypto wallet. Often, scammers leverage this concept to cheat unsuspecting victims out of their funds, and their activities are increasing at an alarming rate. Crypto consumers claim to have lost more than $114 million through this method in 2023 alone. Scammers prefer this Bitcoin ATM method because of its anonymity and the immediacy of fund delivery. The US currently has the largest number of Bitcoin ATMs, and quite a number of them are unregulated. Australia Records 29-month Streak of Monthly Bitcoin ATM Additions As the number of Bitcoin ATMs in America increases, so does it in other regions. In December 2024, Australia reported a record of 1,359 Bitcoin ATMs operating in its jurisdiction. At the time, this figure represented about 3.5% of all crypto ATMs worldwide. According to Statista data, the number of Bitcoin ATMs globally was over 38,299 as of May 1, 2025. Even with the increasing occurrence of scams, the number of Bitcoin ATMs will likely keep spiking. Tactics Employed by Bitcoin ATM Scammers To deceive users of the Bitcoin ATM, the bad actor usually poses as a law enforcement agent, a government official, or technical support personnel. They create a story strong enough to scare the crypto enthusiast, and then add a tone of urgency to ensure that the victim takes immediate action. On one occasion, a 66-year-old South Carolina-based retired health care worker was told by a scammer posing as an officer with the Beaufort County Sheriff’s Office that she was in contempt of court for missing jury duty. The scammer claimed that there was an arrest warrant out for her. She was told she could pay a $7,500 bond through a Bitcoin ATM to stay out of prison. At another time, a breach could reveal customers’ personal details.

2025-06-01T16:21:30,"These Metrics Are Overheating While Bitcoin Remains Bullish: CryptoQuant","Bitcoin (BTC) is well within a bull market, but certain metrics suggest that the cryptocurrency may have reached a short-term top. This means that BTC may experience a significant price correction before another rally ensues. A report from the market analytics platform CryptoQuant revealed that the metrics that appear to be overheating are those pertaining to Bitcoin’s demand growth. Regardless, Bitcoin’s overall conditions remain bullish, and the CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index is at 80. Historical data shows BTC has continued to rally, provided the index remains above 50. Demand Metrics Are Overheating CryptoQuant analysts report that BTC balances held by whales have increased by 2.8% over the past month. They also estimate Bitcoin’s demand growth to be at 229,000 BTC within the same time frame. This figure is close to the demand growth recorded in December 2024 at 279,000 BTC when the cryptocurrency surged past $100,000 for the first time. Such paces often precede a slowdown in whale accumulation, and as analysts always say, BTC needs strong demand to sustain a rally. Additionally, the Bitcoin Traders’ Unrealized Profit Margin has approached a level that often indicates potential resistance for prices. According to historical data, bitcoin’s price surge tends to slow down whenever the metric nears 40% or crosses below its 30-day moving average, which is currently at 19%. At the time BTC rallied past $111,000 last week, the margin hit 32%. This means it got close to 40%, which is the level marked for overheating. Bitcoin Falls Below $104K Analysts believe $120,000 could be the next major resistance level for BTC if it continues to rally. This is because $120,000 is the upper band of the Traders’ On-chain Realized price – here, the unrealized profit margin sits at 40%. Historical data indicate that this upper band has consistently served as a key resistance during bull markets. While BTC still faces the possibility of a continued rally, the asset had fallen below $104,000 at the time of writing. Data from CoinMarketCap showed BTC was down 2% in 24 hours, tumbling from the $105,000 level. Meanwhile, analysts have revealed that BTC investors have been realizing some profits following the recent price surge, but at moderate levels compared to past markets. Hence, there is no evidence to suggest that the bull cycle is ending; in fact, market conditions indicate continued strength in bitcoin’s upward trajectory.

The order mandates the creation of departments to manage and accumulate digital assets, reinforcing long-term demand for decentralized money. As the U.S. Treasury and Commerce Departments begin executing these strategies, investors are eyeing not just Bitcoin, but what could come next. And that’s exactly where Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) enters the spotlight. A New Bitcoin Narrative Begins Bitcoin Solaris isn’t trying to replace Bitcoin. It’s here to complete the mission Bitcoin started—but in a world that’s now mobile-first, speed-driven, and efficiency-demanding. With a dual-layered blockchain architecture, BTC-S integrates a Proof-of-Work (PoW) base layer and a Proof-of-Contribution (PoC) reward structure to maintain decentralized integrity, while an application layer driven by Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Time (PoT) executes transactions at 10,000 TPS with 2-second finality. Where Bitcoin can be slow, expensive, and energy-intensive, Bitcoin Solaris is built for scale, without compromising decentralization. Built-In Demand Through Inclusive Mining Bitcoin Solaris flips the mining paradigm on its head. The upcoming Solaris Nova App brings mining to your phone, laptop, or browser. You don’t need expensive hardware, complicated setups, or huge energy bills. All you need is to hold BTC-S—and that’s where the demand curve bends upward. By requiring users to hold BTC-S tokens to participate in mining , Bitcoin Solaris removes supply from the open market, naturally reducing selling pressure and encouraging long-term participation. This system not only democratizes mining access, but creates steady, price-supportive demand from every user who joins the ecosystem. The Final Day at $5: The Window Is Closing The buzz isn’t just theoretical. With less than 9 weeks left in one of the shortest and most explosive presales in crypto history, over 11,000 users have already joined—and today is the final day before the presale price rises from $5 to $6. With a projected launch price of $20 and a potential return estimated at 1,900%, BTC-S is turning heads across the market. This isn’t speculation—it’s structured growth. Bitcoin Solaris has already raised over $1.8M, and its controlled token distribution ensures that value stays locked into active contributors—not early flippers. From Zero to Wealth—How BTC-S Levels the Crypto Playing Field Bitcoin Solaris Liquid Staking: Rewards Without Sacrifice Traditional staking often locks users out of their tokens—but not here. Bitcoin Solaris introduces liquid staking , a breakthrough feature where staked tokens are converted into sBTC-S at a 1:1 ratio. These liquid assets can still be used in DeFi, governance, lending, and more—all while earning staking rewards. Passive income with no lockups DeFi-compatible for expanded use Fully integrated into the Solaris Nova App Auto validator assignment for a seamless staking experience This opens the door to dynamic staking—a future-forward model where your assets remain active while working for you. Verified. Audited. Trusted. Security isn’t a tagline—it’s a requirement. Bitcoin Solaris has passed comprehensive smart contract audits by both Cyberscope and Freshcoins , and the team has completed full KYC verification . This foundation of trust is essential in today’s landscape—especially for a project aiming to serve as the “second Bitcoin.” Influencers and Analysts See the Signal The momentum is not going unnoticed. Respected analysts and creators are spotlighting BTC-S as the top sleeper for 2025. A full review by Crypto Dex World unpacks why Bitcoin Solaris is being positioned by many as the next generational wealth opportunity. This isn’t just hype—it’s traction built on real fundamentals. Conclusion: A Rare Second Shot at Bitcoin-Level Wealth Most people missed Bitcoin under $100. Fewer had the conviction to hold when it mattered. Today, Bitcoin is a macro asset—and while it will likely continue to grow, those jaw-dropping gains are in the past. With an inclusive mining model, verified infrastructure, ultra-fast execution, and real-world scalability, BTC-S isn’t just another token—it’s a second shot at being early. Backed by a government shift toward digital assets and designed with long-term growth in mind, the time to act is now.

2025-06-01T16:00:29,"Bitcoin Tipped For $340,000 Target If This Support Level Holds – Details","A prominent crypto analyst with X username PlanD has backed Bitcoin to maintain its uptrend despite some significant price retracement in the past week. Notably, PlanD states the premier cryptocurrency remains on course for a $340,000 price point but only if a specific support zone remains valid. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio Says It’s Time For ‘Cautious Optimism’ — Further Upside Growth Incoming? Bitcoin Bullish Momentum Hinges On $91,000 – $100,000 Support Structure In an X post on May 31, PlanD outlined Bitcoin’s potential to soon re-enter price discovery mode regardless of the recent price dip. Since hitting a new all-time high at $111,970, the flagship cryptocurrency has slipped into a minor corrective phase, forcing market prices to go below $104,000. However, PlanD explains that Bitcoin’s price action has a 3-year giant cup and handle pattern that postulates the digital asset is set for immense price gains in the current bull cycle. The cup-and-handle pattern is a common chart pattern that signals a bullish continuation in price movement. As illustrated in the chart above, the cup is formed Bitcoin’s crash from its previous all-time high at $69,000 in November 2021 followed by a stabilization and recovery period which lasted until March 2024 when Bitcoin returned to the same price level. This is followed by the handle which is the descending channel as seen from March 2024 to around October 2024 before Bitcoin achieved a decisive price breakout above the neckline of $76,000 in November 2024. Despite registering impressive strides from this price point to around $112,000, PlanD notes that the Cup-and-Handle pattern tips Bitcoin to hit a price target of $340,000 before 2025. Amidst the ongoing retracement, the analyst states that this bullish structure remains in place as long as Bitcoin remains above the support price zone of $91,000-$100,000. Provided the premier cryptocurrency does not fall below this price level, the ongoing correction is expected to serve as mere pullback in preparation for a major upswing. Related Reading: XRP Price Risks Crash Below $2 As Correction Takes Hold, Here’s Why Bitcoin Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $104,739 following a minor price gain of 0.64% in the past day. Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume is valued at $40.03 billion following a 31.28% increase in the past day. Despite this slight price increase in the past day, Bitcoin must return to its current all-time high at $111,970 to neutralize any current bearish potential. However, the premier cryptocurrency will face familiar resistances at the $106,000 and $109,000 to achieve this task.

2025-06-01T15:04:53,"Best Altcoins to Buy Before Bitcoin Becomes ‘Exponentially Harder to Buy’","‘No force on earth can stop it’ is what Michael Saylor, Strategy’s founder, had to say about the digital gold during the recently concluded Bitcoin 2025 event in Las Vegas. As the head of possibly the most pro-crypto corporation, Saylor pointed towards the growing interest among other large companies to replicate Strategy’s Bitcoin play. Keep reading to find out exactly what Saylor said and why his unwavering confidence in Bitcoin provides retailers like you and us the opportunity to accumulate the best altcoins before the next crypto rally. Companies Worldwide Are Embracing Bitcoin During his time at the Bitcoin event, Saylor noticed a surreal ‘explosion of interest’ by companies to follow Strategy’s ‘buy and HODL $BTC’ playbook. Moreover, the companies that approached Saylor during the event belonged to different parts of the world, including the UK, Hong Kong, and South Korea. This is huge because it confirms that $BTC’s rising popularity isn’t just limited to the US. Speaking of the US, it’s worth remembering that president Trump signed an executive order earlier this year, kickstarting the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Combined with Vice President JD Vance’s recent address to the Bitcoin community, where he said that $BTC is ‘a hedge against inflation, censorship, and unelected bureaucrats,’ it’s easy to see the merit behind Saylor’s Bitcoin stance. In addition to calling Bitcoin ‘the most explosive idea of the era’ and ‘an idea whose time has come,’ Saylor also remarked that an unprecedented interest in buying $BTC could make it exponentially harder to accumulate the asset. We think it will get exponentially harder to buy Bitcoin, but we will work exponentially more efficiently to buy Bitcoin – Michael Saylor Everything signals to this being a perfect time to buy and HODL some of the top cryptos that could pump heavily during a $BTC supply squeeze. To help you get started, here are our top three recommendations. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Bitcoin-Themed Altcoin on the Market Right Now BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is arguably the best crypto to buy now thanks to its never-before-seen approach to following Bitcoin’s growth trajectory. $BTCBULL holders who store their tokens in Best Wallet will automatically receive free (and 100% legit) $BTC as airdrops. These airdrops will take place whenever the king cryptocurrency reaches the mighty price landmarks of $150K and $200K for the very first time. Additionally, BTC Bull Token will also regularly burn a portion of its total token supply. This will keep a check on the token’s availability, hiking its demand and price during Bitcoin bull runs. Needless to say, the best time to buy a new meme coin is when it’s in presale, which, luckily for you, $BTCBULL is. The project has raised over $6.6M, and each token is currently available for just $0.00254. Here’s how to buy it . 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Best AI Agent Altcoin for Real-Time Crypto Investment Advice MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is the perfect ally to have during a crypto bull run. This AI agent coin will identify the best cryptos to invest in on your behalf, and that, too, after carefully analyzing social trends and on-chain activity data. $MIND interacts with crypto influencers on platforms like X, where it patiently listens to their unique opinions on various altcoins going around. Next, it combines this data with real-time information from CoinMarketCap and DexScreener to find out underrated coins that are silently shaping up to become the next cryptos to explode . It’s worth noting, though, that access to MIND of Pepe ‘s actionable crypto trading signals will be reserved for $MIND token holders. If you want to become a $MIND owner, this might just be your last chance. The project’s presale ($12M+ raised) is coming to a close in less than 36 hours, following which you’d probably never be able to buy $MIND for a low price of $0.0037515. 3. TROLL ($TROLL) – Meme Coin Based on Internet Trolling TROLL’s success is proof that there’s still enough space for ‘dank’ internet users who like to indulge in occasional – and hopefully harmless – online trolling. This low-cap coin has surged over 120% since its launch in the latter half of April. Over 8% of these gains have come in just the last seven days, making $TROLL one of the top trending cryptos currently. $TROLL is currently trading at $0.02189 , and a break above the $0.023 resistance level can see it reach for $0.028. Moreover, with continued momentum, especially during a trending crypto market, can see $TROLL even claim its all-time high of around $0.040. If this prediction holds true, investors who position themselves in $TROLL now can potentially churn out 180% in returns. DYOR Before Investing in the Best Altcoins With a squeeze in Bitcoin supply likely to send the broader crypto market soaring, top presale altcoins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) and MIND of Pepe ($MIND) are certainly great inclusions in your crypto portfolio. However, beware that the crypto market is highly volatile; it turns and twists upon every big and small macroeconomic event. We’d advise you to only invest after doing your own research and due diligence. None of the above is a substitute for professional financial advice.",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/best-altcoins-to-buy-before-bitcoin-becomes-exponentially-harder-to-buy/,"ALTCOIN|ASIA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Cryptocurrency Market News",cryptocompare
2025-06-01T15:04:29,"CONY: Sky-High Payouts But Near-Term Uncertainty Rising","Summary CONY's high yield is driven by a covered-call strategy on Coinbase, but the share price has declined over 60% since inception. Current market conditions—low implied volatility and unfavorable Bitcoin seasonality—make covered-call selling less attractive for CONY. I'm bullish on Bitcoin long-term due to ETF inflows, institutional adoption, and reduced exchange supply, but June seasonality tempers my enthusiasm. I rate CONY a sell, Coinbase and Bitcoin a hold, citing systematic strategy risks, low volatility, and seasonal headwinds for CONY. The YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY ) sells covered-call on Coinbase stock and distributes the premia proceeds to holders. This distribution currently annualizes into a 123.31% rate. However, this isn't a yield in the traditional sense where usually some kind of relatively steady profit is disbursed. Like with REITs or MLPs or leveraged fixed-income CEFs or things like that. The graph below illustrates this effect and how the share price went down over 60% since inception while the yield lead to a positive total return of ~109%: Data by YCharts A low triple digit return since inception is very good. However, I'd caution this is driven in part by the strong return of the underlying. The return profile is relatively favorable to sell covered calls. I'm also apprehensive of what's essentially a mechanical covered-call selling strategy. Selling more calls as money pours into the ETF: Data by YCharts This could potentially depress call prices, which is to the strategy's disadvantage. Last time I wrote about CONY I said: This time, I think there is a chance the underlying will be surprisingly strong in April and that makes it unfavorable to sell short-term calls against it. I’ll detail why I think Coinbase could do well during April. and I’m wary of the Coinbase seasonal data because it usually holds its earnings call in March, but the next one is coming up at the end of April. I think April could be a lot better this time around. Because generally Bitcoin is also quite strong in April, that lines up favorably. Coinbase got hammered on April 2 along with the rest of the market but recovered well. I don't remember how I got the notion earnings were moved to the end of April because they were May 8, and they propelled the stock. Coinbase and Bitcoin both ended up at ~21% with CONY lagging at a very respectable 9%. Data by YCharts Meanwhile, we're moving into June when Bitcoin seasonality is unfavorable. This is relevant because Coinbase price is quite correlated with the most important digital asset. Bitcoin Seasonality (Author's Own) Last time I argued Coinbase volatility was very low, making selling calls less attractive. It is now even lower. In the past 6 or 12-month periods the IV has only been lower 9% of the time. A silver lining; out of the money Coinbase calls are now somewhat more expensive than similar puts. Last time this wasn't the case while it is common for Coinbase and Bitcoin calls to trade like that. I'm currently still bullish on Bitcoin as I laid out in Potential Interesting Way To Gain Bitcoin Exposure. Key reasons: 1) Bitcoin ETF inflows are very strong this year. Below; assets under management for the two largest players. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ): Data by YCharts 2) Institutional adoption continues with RIA's increasingly allocating client portfolios to crypto. 3) Potentially Bitcoin is in a high profit/low volatility phase (coined by Fidelity). Somewhat confirmed by the low implied vol on both CONY as well as IBIT. 4) Bitcoin supply on exchanges going down, indicating a preference for long-term hodling over trading. 5) Expect Strategy ( MSTR ) to aggressively accumulate Bitcoin as long as its share price remains buoyant. On May 26, the firm reported having issued shares to buy another 4k Bitcoins. Seeking Alpha data shows its momentum as A+ and as long as it continues to run, I expect it to keep buying. Either financed by equity issuance or (convertible) debt. 6) Global money supply increased during April: Global money supply (MicroMacro) My enthusiasm is somewhat decreased because June is generally quite bad. I'm temporarily lowering my buy rating to hold. Right now, I rate these related assets as follows (with the caveat I can easily revert Bitcoin back to a buy in June): Asset Rating Coinbase Hold Bitcoin Hold CONY Sell I'm not a huge fan of most of the crypto-related equities. I think it is more important to avoid Strategy than Coinbase. From my latest note on MSTY : ...it owns around 500k Bitcoins. These are worth roughly speaking $40 billion. Meanwhile, the company's enterprise value is around $78 billion... But until the next Coinbase earnings call (Seeking Alpha data has it on 8/7/2025) the stock likely correlates highly to Bitcoin. I'd rather just be long Bitcoin without the execution risk at the company level. However, I don't expect it to perform badly while Bitcoin is doing well. It is really the valuation (D by Seeking Alpha) and the fact I don't really believe in the long term competitive advantage that usually keeps me from rating Coinbase equal to Bitcoin. This time I'll keep COIN at hold because I prefer it over CONY and don't want to lower the latter towards a strong sell. The main reasons I rate CONY lower are the systematic covered-call strategy while AUM is increasing rapidly, the low IV on Coinbase stock and the seasonal headwinds.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4791540-cony-sky-high-payouts-but-near-term-uncertainty-rising?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","IBIT|FBTC|MSTR|COIN|CONY",cryptocompare

On the 2-hour chart, Solana’s price is stuck in a descending channel, characterized by lower highs and lows, indicating clear selling pressure. The 50-period EMA at $160.79, once support, is now resistance. The MACD is bearish, MACD line below signal line and red histogram bars. Price is approaching the $150.66 support zone, the lower boundary of the channel. If a bullish reversal candle, such as a Hammer or Bullish Engulfing, forms here with MACD convergence, we could see a move to $158.33 or $160.79. But a clean break below $150.66 could take SOL to $142.14 or $134.01. Key Technical Levels: Support: $150.66, $142.14, $134.01 Resistance: $158.33, $160.79, $165.59 For traders, wait for confirmation—rising volume and a bullish candle—before going long. Without that, SOL is bearish, but a textbook rebound at $150 could be a good entry. BTC Bull Token Presale Approaches $7.67M Mark as 62% APY Staking Draws Interest With SOL/USD dipping below $160, attention is shifting to altcoins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . So far, $6.38 million has been raised, with the next price jump approaching quickly. Bitcoin Rewards and Supply Reductions BTC Bull Token operates with a built-in system: the higher BTC’s price, the more BTC airdrops are distributed to token holders. Notably, presale participants receive priority. The system also features: Token burns every $ 50,000 BTC increase, reducing the supply. The current token price is at $0.00254 before the next bump. This approach aligns token value with BTC/USD’s price moves while maintaining scarcity through programmed burns. Staking Terms for Passive Returns – BTCBULL’s staking pool holds 1.62 billion tokens offering 65% APY, with: No lockup periods or fees. Full access to funds at any time. This structure appeals to investors seeking yield without complex requirements or the risk of illiquidity. Momentum Before the Cap Fills With just over $1 million remaining in the presale, buyers are positioning early. The token’s mechanics of BTC-tied rewards, supply adjustments, and staking options are driving participation. Key figures: USDT raised : $6,632,712/ $7,676,876 Token price : $0.00254 BTCBULL offers a whopping ~62% APY on its Ethereum-based staking pool (currently holding 1.61B BTCBULL), with no lockups or withdrawal fees.

2025-06-01T15:00:01,"Czech Justice Minister Resigns After Accepting Bitcoin from Convicted Criminal","Czech Republic’s Justice Minister, Pavel Blazek, has stepped down amid growing backlash over the sale of nearly $45 million worth of Bitcoin donated by a convicted drug trafficker. The resignation, announced on May 30, follows a police investigation into the source of the cryptocurrency and mounting political pressure just months ahead of national elections. The scandal erupted after the Justice Ministry announced on May 28 via X that it had auctioned off 500 Bitcoin, raising almost 1 billion Czech koruna (approximately $45 million). The funds were intended for projects such as improving prison infrastructure, digitizing the justice system, and reducing drug use in correctional facilities. However, a report by local media outlet Denik N revealed that the cryptocurrency came from Tomas Jirikovsky — the operator of Sheep Marketplace, a dark web platform infamous for hosting illicit drug and weapons sales. Jirikovsky, convicted in 2017, served time for crimes including embezzlement and drug trafficking. Bitcoin ‘Gift’ Raises Eyes on Czech Justice Minister The controversy intensified after it emerged that Blazek accepted the donation without verifying its origin. Jirikovsky’s lawyer had approached the ministry in March, offering one-third of his remaining Bitcoin holdings as a donation. Blazek, defending his decision, claimed he had “no way to investigate the matter” and assumed it was an act of repentance. “I wasn’t interested so many years after the case,” Blazek told reporters at a press conference. “It was his decision to make amends.” The public, however, reacted sharply to the perceived negligence. Opposition leaders branded the move a scandal, criticizing the lack of due diligence in accepting cryptocurrency from a known criminal. Police have now opened an investigation into the true origin of the Bitcoin. Jirikovsky has reportedly been trying to reclaim 1,500 Bitcoin seized at the time of his arrest. Although authorities suspected his crypto holdings were linked to other dark web operations like Nucleus, the court ultimately ruled he could keep the coins after his release in 2021 due to insufficient proof of illegality. Blazek Steps Down as Crypto Rules Take Shape As the political fallout grew, Prime Minister Petr Fiala distanced himself from Blazek, a long-time ally. To preserve the government’s credibility, Blazek announced his resignation. “I am not aware of any illegal action. However, I do not wish to damage the reputation of the government,” he said in a statement. His resignation comes at a time when Czechia is beginning to define its crypto policy framework. In February, President Petr Pavel signed into law new cryptocurrency regulations aligned with the European Union’s MiCA guidelines. The law aims to clarify taxation and promote innovation in the blockchain sector, signaling Czech’s forward-looking approach to digital assets .

2025-06-01T14:54:45,"AI Trading Bots for Risk-Adjusted Returns in Crypto","While most crypto traders fixate on maximum returns, professional investors focus on risk-adjusted performance—the returns generated relative to the risks taken. Cryptocurrency markets present unique challenges with their extreme volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and 24/7 trading cycles. AI trading systems excel in this environment by maintaining consistent risk parameters regardless of market conditions. A properly configured DeFi trading bot applies mathematical precision to risk management tasks that human traders often compromise during emotional market phases. This article examines how AI trading bots implement sophisticated risk-adjusted strategies and the metrics to evaluate their effectiveness. Risk-Adjusted Returns in Crypto Markets Risk-adjusted returns measure investment performance accounting for the risk assumed to generate those returns. Unlike absolute returns, which only show profits, risk-adjusted metrics provide context for those gains. Key risk-adjusted performance indicators include: Sharpe Ratio: Returns beyond risk-free rate divided by standard deviation of returns Sortino Ratio: Similar to Sharpe but only considers downside deviation Maximum Drawdown: Largest percentage drop from peak to subsequent trough Calmar Ratio: Annual return divided by maximum drawdown Ulcer Index: Measures drawdown pain over time Crypto markets demand specialized risk assessment due to their fat-tailed distribution patterns—extreme events occur more frequently than traditional financial models predict. While HODLing crypto assets has historically produced strong overall returns, the journey includes drawdowns exceeding 85% during bear markets. AI trading strategies typically target more modest returns with significantly reduced drawdowns, resulting in superior risk-adjusted performance. Key Risk Management Capabilities of AI Trading Bots AI trading bots implement programmatic risk management through several core capabilities: Position Sizing Algorithms: Automatically adjust trade size based on volatility metrics, reducing exposure during turbulent markets. Dynamic Stop-Loss Systems: Continuously recalculate optimal stop-loss levels using standard deviation bands, support/resistance levels, or volatility-based approaches. Correlation-Based Hedging: Monitor relationships between assets to prevent overexposure to single risk factors. Drawdown Controls: Implement trading size reductions after losses to preserve capital during drawdowns. Tail Risk Detection: Use machine learning to identify patterns preceding major market dislocations. Volatility-Responsive Trading Strategies Volatility forms the cornerstone of risk-adjusted trading systems. Advanced bots implement: Volatility Bands Trading: Only entering positions when market volatility falls within predetermined ranges, avoiding both extremely quiet markets (insufficient movement) and chaotic conditions (excessive risk). ATR-Based Position Sizing: Using Average True Range to establish position sizes proportional to market noise, reducing allocations when volatility expands. Regime-Switching Models: Implementing different parameter sets for distinct volatility regimes, automatically shifting between aggressive, moderate, and defensive postures. Volatility Trend Analysis: Analyzing directional changes in volatility to predict potential market regime shifts before they fully materialize. AI-Powered Risk Assessment Techniques AI systems continuously evaluate market conditions to adjust risk parameters using: Regime Classification: Machine learning models categorize current market conditions into distinct regimes (trending, ranging, volatile) based on dozens of technical factors. Anomaly Detection: Unsupervised learning algorithms flag unusual market behavior that doesn't match historical patterns, triggering defensive measures. NLP Sentiment Analysis : Monitoring news and social media sentiment to adjust risk exposure when negative sentiment spikes precede potential downturns. Cross-Asset Correlation Analysis: Tracking dynamic relationships between cryptocurrencies, detecting when typically uncorrelated assets move together — a warning sign of systemic risk. Machine Learning Models for Risk Profiling Specific machine learning approaches deliver superior risk assessment: Gaussian Mixture Models: Identify distinct market volatility regimes without requiring labeled data. LSTM Networks: Predict volatility spikes by recognizing temporal patterns in market data sequences. Random Forest Classifiers: Rank feature importance to identify which indicators currently drive market risk. Reinforcement Learning: Discover optimal risk-reward tradeoffs through experience, optimizing for Sharpe ratio rather than absolute returns. Implementing Risk-Adjusted Bot Strategies Practical implementation of risk-adjusted trading bots requires specific configuration approaches: Calibrate risk parameters first, then optimize for returns—not vice versa. Start with maximum drawdown limits, then adjust other parameters to maximize returns within these constraints. Backtest across multiple market regimes with emphasis on stress periods. A strategy should demonstrate resilience during crashes, not just performance during uptrends. Implement gradual capital deployment through dollar-cost averaging into positions rather than taking full-size entries. Employ time-based risk adjustments, reducing position sizes during historically volatile time periods (like weekend markets or around major economic announcements). Configure cross-market hedging to offset directional exposure when correlation between assets increases. Position Sizing and Risk Allocation Position sizing represents the most powerful risk management tool available: Volatility-Adjusted Position Sizing: $Position = \frac{Account \times Risk%}{Volatility \times Stop Distance}$ Risk Parity Approach: Allocate capital inverse to asset volatility, giving more stable assets larger allocations. Correlation-Weighted Exposure: Reduce aggregate positions in highly correlated assets to prevent overexposure to single risk factors. Maximum Drawdown Recovery Sizing: Scale position sizes relative to distance from maximum equity peak, reducing exposure after drawdowns. Measuring Bot Performance Through Risk-Adjusted Metrics Evaluate bot performance using risk-adjusted metrics rather than absolute returns: Track monthly Sharpe and Sortino ratios with a target of consistently maintaining values above 1.5 and 2.0 respectively. Compare maximum drawdown percentage against absolute returns. Professional strategies typically target annual returns at least twice their maximum drawdown. Monitor recovery time after drawdowns—the period required to reach new equity highs after losses. Analyze performance variation across market regimes to identify strategy blind spots. Even slight underperformance during certain market phases is acceptable if the strategy demonstrates strong risk-adjusted returns overall. Case Study: AI Bot Performance During Market Stress During the May 2021 crypto crash, when Bitcoin fell 53% from its peak, several AI trading strategies demonstrated superior risk management: Early Reduction of Exposure: Machine learning models detected anomalous market conditions 12-24 hours before the major crash, automatically reducing position sizes. Volatility-Based Position Sizing: Strategies employing volatility-adjusted position sizing automatically reduced trade size as market turbulence increased. Correlation-Based Risk Management: Systems monitoring inter-market correlations detected unusual synchronization across assets and implemented defensive measures. Recovery Positioning: While human traders often remained sidelined after the crash, AI systems methodically re-entered positions at technical support levels, capturing the subsequent recovery. The most successful systems maintained drawdowns below 15% during this period, compared to the broader market's 50%+ decline. Conclusion: Balancing Risk and Return in Automated Trading Effective AI trading bots prioritize risk management over profit maximization. Configure systems to target consistent, moderate returns with minimal drawdowns rather than maximum possible gains. Evaluate performance through risk-adjusted metrics rather than absolute returns, and ensure your strategy performs adequately across all market regimes. Remember that the most successful automated trading approach isn't necessarily the one with the highest returns during bull markets, but the one that preserves capital during downturns while delivering acceptable performance over complete market cycles.
