2025-06-02T01:42:21,"Why is XRP Price Going Down Today?","The post Why is XRP Price Going Down Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The price of XRP has been under pressure lately, and traders are closely watching some key levels on the charts. After recently hitting a high near $2.47, XRP has struggled to hold steady and has been stuck in a downtrend. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $2.17, slightly recovering after dipping to a low of $2.13 earlier. The price is battling to stay above the important average level of $2.15, but it hasn’t been easy. Important Levels To Watch Right now, XRP is retesting an important Fibonacci support zone between $2.10 and $2.15. This level has provided strong support in the past, and bulls will need to defend it to prevent further losses. If the price drops below $2.10 and confirms with a daily candle close, things could get worse. In that case, the next support levels to watch would be around $2.05 and then possibly closer to $2.00. A break below $2.00 could be bad news for XRP, with the risk of a fall towards $1.80–$1.70. Resistance on the Way Up On the upside, there’s tough resistance waiting between $2.30 and $2.34, with more sellers likely around $2.44 and then between $2.56 and $2.62. Unless XRP can break through these zones, it’s unlikely to see any strong bullish moves soon. XRP’s recent drop follows broader market weakness. Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies also fell and tested key support levels after uncertainty over U.S. tariff news weighed on investor sentiment. However, there’s a silver lining for XRP holders. Ripple’s long-running legal battle with the SEC might be nearing its end, and if the outcome is favorable, it could reshape XRP’s regulatory status. This would be a positive for the token and might give its price a much-needed boost in the near future.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-is-xrp-price-going-down-today-2/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP","News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

2025-06-02T00:22:59,"Asia Morning Briefing: BTC Stalls at 105K as Analyst Says Market Looks 'Overheated'","Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin BTC is trading above $105K as Asia begins its business week. The world's largest digital asset remained relatively stable over the weekend, with a 0.4% movement, and trading volume was compressed. While overall market conditions remain bullish, a new report from CryptoQuant suggests that certain metrics indicate the BTC market is “overheating.” The report shows bitcoin demand has climbed to 229,000 BTC over the past 30 days, approaching the December 2024 peak of 279,000 BTC. At the same time, whale-held balances have risen by 2.8 percent, a pace that often signals slowing accumulation. These indicators suggest the current rally, which pushed prices to a record $112,000, may be nearing a short-term top. The report highlights $120,000 as the next major resistance level, tied to the upper band of the Traders’ On-chain Realized Price, where unrealized profits would hit 40 percent, a threshold that has historically marked local tops. While CryptoQuant’s ""Bull Score Index"" remains strong at 80, signaling continued bullish momentum, rising profit margins, and peaking demand growth suggest traders may face a period of consolidation before the next leg higher. News Roundup: James Wynn Gets Liquidated, But Says He'll 'Run it All Back' James Wynn, a trader renowned for his aggressive, high-leverage bets on Hyperliquid, has been fully liquidated, leaving him with just $23 in his account after sustaining losses totaling more than $17 million, CoinDesk previously reported. Wynn, who attracted significant attention with trades involving bitcoin, memecoins like PEPE, and even obscure tokens such as FARTCOIN, first faced steep declines from a massive $1.25 billion long position on BTC, resulting in a loss exceeding $37 million after prices dipped below $105,000 amid geopolitical turmoil. Throughout the volatile month, Wynn rapidly cycled through trades, briefly netting an unrealized gain of $85 million before market swings wiped him out completely. An account associated with Wynn downplayed the dramatic liquidation, defiantly stating on X: ""I'll run it back, I always do. And I'll enjoy doing it. I like playing the game. I took a large and calculated bet at making billions."" Brazil's Méliuz Shares Sink 8% After Announcing $78M Equity Raise to Buy Bitcoin Brazilian fintech Méliuz plans to raise up to $78 million through a public equity offering, intending to allocate all proceeds to purchasing Bitcoin and positioning the cryptocurrency as a primary strategic asset in its treasury, CoinDesk previously reported . However, Méliuz’s strategy hasn't impressed the market yet, as shares dropped more than 8% following the announcement. The initial offering includes 17 million common shares, with the potential to expand up to 51 million, and investors will receive subscription warrants allowing future stock purchases at set prices. Known for its cashback and financial services platform serving over 30 million users, Méliuz currently holds 320.2 BTC, having previously committed 10% of its cash reserves to Bitcoin in March. Trading for the subscription warrants is expected to commence on June 16, with share settlement and warrant issuance finalized by June 18. NYC Comptroller Rejects Mayor Adams' 'BitBond', Warns Deviating from Dollar Could Undermine City's Credit Reputation New York City's Comptroller Brad Lander sharply criticized Mayor Eric Adams' plan to issue municipal bonds backed by bitcoin, labeling the proposed ""BitBond"" as ""legally dubious and fiscally irresponsible,"" CoinDesk previously reported. Lander rejected the idea just days after Adams introduced it at a bitcoin conference in Las Vegas, emphasizing that cryptocurrency's instability makes it unsuitable to reliably fund critical city projects such as infrastructure and affordable housing. Mayor Adams has actively promoted cryptocurrency initiatives since entering office, including converting his own paychecks into digital assets and establishing a digital asset advisory council. However, Comptroller Lander highlighted serious practical concerns with the BitBond proposal, noting federal tax laws and city financial regulations would make the proposal unworkable, and warned that deviating from the dollar-based municipal borrowing system could undermine investor confidence and New York City's credit reputation. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin showed resilience, staging a V-shaped recovery between $103,813.37 and $105,305.75 amid notable volume spikes. ETH: Ethereum formed a bullish reversal pattern, rebounding from strong support at $2,472.84 to $2,527.53 amid high-volume buying momentum, according to CoinDesk's Market Insight Bot. Gold: Gold climbed 0.6% to $3,311.66, as traders weighed its recent retreat from record highs against ongoing investor and central bank appetite driven by uncertainty over US tariffs and broader economic risks. Nikkei 225: Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 0.89% as Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed following Trump's announcement of increased steel tariffs. S&P 500 Futures: Stock futures dipped Sunday to start June after the S&P 500's strongest month since November 2023, amid uncertainty over President Trump's tariffs following recent contradictory court rulings.

2025-06-02T00:00:15,"Insurance Companies Attempting To Take Advantage of Crypto Investors Who Fear Kidnapping: Report","Insurance companies are reportedly looking to capitalize on the rising incidents of kidnapping and physical violence targeting crypto millionaires. NBC News reports that at least three companies that provide insurance and security services for cryptocurrency investors and firms are preparing to offer kidnap and ransom (K&R) insurance policies for those with security concerns stemming from their crypto holdings. According to Rebecca Rubenfeld, chief operating officer at the crypto insurance firm AnchorWatch, the fear of violence was a big topic at the annual Bitcoin Conference that was held in Las Vegas last week. “They’re tense. I’m not saying that because I’m trying to sell insurance, but overall, the mood is a very good environment for me.” AnchorWatch is considering offering kidnapping and ransom protection in the coming months. The news comes after a string of reports emerged about the kidnapping of crypto investors. Last month, armed assailants reportedly tried to abduct the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noiza, the CEO of the French crypto exchange platform Paymium, in Paris. In another incident, three teenagers allegedly stole $4 million worth of cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) from a man who hosted a crypto-related event in Las Vegas and left him stranded at White Hills, Arizona. And last week in New York City, a kidnapper allegedly tortured and threatened a crypto investor for three weeks to gain access to his Bitcoin ( BTC ) wallet.

2025-06-01T23:30:41,"Is Ethereum Price Gearing Up For A Monster Rally? ETH Up 80% The Last Time This Happened","The Ethereum price has slowed down — repeatedly failing to breach the resistance zone around $2,800 — over the past few weeks after making a strong start to the month of May. The second-largest cryptocurrency will aim to replicate this brilliant form in the early days of June in order to reclaim the coveted $3,000 level over the coming months. Since losing the $3,000 level in early February, the price of ETH has struggled to build a sustained bullish momentum, reaching only above $2,700 multiple times in the past few weeks. However, recent market data shows that the Ethereum price could be preparing for an extended rally over the next few months. What Do Ether Whales Know? In a May 31 post on the social media platform X, pseudonymous crypto analyst Darkfost provided an on-chain outlook on the Ethereum price momentum and investor sentiment. According to the market analyst, an on-chain signal that preceded a significant price rally for ETH in the past has gone off. The relevant indicator here is Ethereum’s Average Order Size on Binance, which is calculated by dividing the total trading volume by the number of trades on the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange (by trading volume). This metric offers insights into the classes of traders — whether it is large institutional investors or retail traders — that are most dominant on a specific exchange. Based on this on-chain metric, the Ethereum large investors are once again back in the market, as shown by the whale orders on Binance since May 19. Darkfost said the chart below provides “an instant snapshot of Ethereum’s sentiment and momentum on Binance, while combining key market data on spot and futures activity, cumulative volumes, with moving averages comparison.” The on-chain analyst added: In short, it’s an all-in-one signal, and today, it’s flashing something rare and powerful because the last time this indicator lit up like this was in December 2023, right before ETH rocketed from $ 2,200 to $ 4,000. Darkfost also mentioned that whales aren’t always trying to find a low entry point, but rather position themselves early when a broader trend begins to show signs of strength. With the average orders on Binance predominantly placed by whales, it implies that the Ethereum price could be gearing up for another 80% move over the next few weeks. Hence, Darkfost believes the month of May might have been a huge entry window, which most of the large investors seemingly took advantage of.

2025-06-01T23:00:48,"Google Gemini Predicts Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price for June 30, 2025","The cryptocurrency landscape, particularly the world of meme coins, continues to draw attention from traders, investors, and enthusiasts eager to decipher short-term price trends. Among these speculative digital assets, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has remained a top favorite, captivating the crypto community with its vibrant ecosystem, strong community backing, and meme-driven hype. As June 2025 begins, many are eager to understand where SHIB might head by month’s end. In this analysis, we delve into Google Gemini’s AI-generated price predictions for Shiba Inu (SHIB) by June 30, 2025, and explore the underlying market conditions that could influence these outcomes. Current Market Snapshot As of report time, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.00001297. SHIB’s price movement over the past few weeks has been largely sideways, with occasional dips reflecting the prevailing bearish sentiment. While major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to dictate general market momentum, meme coins like SHIB are especially vulnerable to sharp swings in sentiment, often reacting intensely to social media trends, whale activity, and ecosystem announcements. Google Gemini’s price predictions for June 30, 2025, acknowledge these dynamics and offer three distinct scenarios: modest, moderate, and bullish. Each scenario is grounded in current price action and potential short-term developments, avoiding heavy reliance on third-party analyst forecasts. Modest Scenario In the modest outlook, Google Gemini suggests that if current bearish pressures persist or if the market remains largely stagnant, SHIB is likely to hover near its present levels or experience a minor decline. This places the expected price range between $0.000012 and $0.000013 by the end of June. Such a scenario assumes that no major catalysts emerge to drive fresh buying momentum. Without news of ecosystem upgrades, major partnerships, or substantial improvements in Shiba Inu’s DeFi, gaming, or metaverse initiatives, the token may simply follow the broader crypto market’s consolidation pattern. Moderate Scenario The moderate prediction envisions a more optimistic, albeit restrained, trajectory for SHIB. If minor positive developments occur, such as incremental upgrades in the Shibarium layer-2 network, enhanced staking mechanisms, or small but impactful partnership announcements, the token could experience a slight boost. Google Gemini forecasts that under these circumstances, SHIB might trade between $0.0000135 and $0.0000145 by June 30. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This outcome also hinges on a mild shift in investor sentiment. Even a subtle change in the risk appetite of retail traders or a temporary uptick in meme coin enthusiasm on platforms like X could propel SHIB modestly higher. While not indicative of a full-fledged bull run, this middle-ground scenario suggests that SHIB retains some room for short-term growth if supported by favorable, albeit limited, catalysts. Bullish Outlook For the bullish scenario, Google Gemini emphasizes the need for a significant uptick in buying pressure, which could push SHIB into the $0.000015 to $0.000017 range by the end of June. Achieving this bullish outcome would require a combination of factors, including a reversal in the broader crypto market’s risk sentiment and substantial, SHIB-specific catalysts. Potential triggers might include a surprise rally in Bitcoin or Ethereum, which often lifts altcoins alongside it, or headline-making developments within the SHIB ecosystem. For example, large-scale Shibarium adoption, accelerated token burns, or the introduction of a highly anticipated project within the SHIB metaverse could ignite fresh investor excitement. Notably, given the bearish tone characterizing early June, achieving such a rapid turnaround would demand not just incremental news but a compelling, confidence-restoring event. The Unpredictable Nature of Meme Coins While these predictions provide structured estimates, it’s essential to underscore the speculative nature of meme coins like Shiba Inu. Unlike blue-chip assets with strong institutional backing and clear utility, meme coins are particularly susceptible to sudden shifts driven by social media trends, influencer commentary, and retail trading frenzies. Even AI-generated forecasts, no matter how sophisticated, cannot fully account for the unpredictable emotional surges that often define the meme coin market. While the modest and moderate scenarios appear more likely in the absence of dramatic market shifts, the crypto market’s inherently unpredictable nature leaves the door open for a surprise bullish surge. Traders and investors are reminded to approach meme coins with caution, balancing enthusiasm with sound risk management.

2025-06-01T22:37:40,"Market Players Conflicted over the Arrival of Altcoin Season, Here’s What They’re Saying","Cryptocurrency personalities share different sentiments regarding the highly talked-about altcoin season, a period in the crypto market when alternative assets outperform Bitcoin in the majority. According to entrepreneur and Bitcoin investor Lark Davis, Bitcoin’s recent bullish performance has failed to stimulate excitement within the broader cryptocurrency market. The investor is convinced the missing piece is the highly anticipated altcoin season. “This cycle has been mostly about Bitcoin so far. Even though BTC smashed through all-time highs, there’s no excitement in the market. The reason is simple: Everyone and their dog are sitting in altcoins, and that’s why even though BTC is near ATHs, altcoin index is sitting at 27 (real altseason starts at 75).” He wrote . As the analyst asserts, Bitcoin has outperformed this in this current market cycle, with a continuous bullish milestone recorded monthly. The asset kicked off 2025 hovering above the $90,000 price mark, before hitting $100,000 briefly, in the latter part of January and February. Last week, Bitcoin hit a new ATH of $111,970 before returning below the $110,000 level. The big bull is trading at a press time price of $109,795. On the other hand, Cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen observed that altcoin and Bitcoin pairs are trading at significantly lower levels. Countering that altcoin season is around the corner, he highlighted the continued downward trend observed within the altcoin market over the last 4 years. “ALT/BTC pairs just put in their lowest weekly close all cycle. Those that call for alt season each week may sound confident and contrarian, but altcoins have been bleeding to Bitcoin almost non-stop since 2021.” Cowen wrote . Where is “altcoin season”? While altcoin season is typically expected to arrive 6-9 months after every Bitcoin halving, the years after the halving year leave analysts gauging, using altcoin season index aggregators designed to analyze the performance of the top 50 altcoins in the market. These aggregators track factors including increased trading volume, increased altcoin dominance, and frequent price breakouts. Altcoin season indexes currently sit at 16, indicating that only 16% of existing altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over 90 days. It is also worth noting that altcoins fail to outperform Bitcoin during some market cycles and continue to trade downward or sideways.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/market-players-conflicted-over-the-arrival-of-altcoin-season-heres-what-theyre-saying/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Cryptocurrency|News|Altcoin|Cryptocurrency News",cryptocompare

As expectations for the coming weeks heighten, price predictions are flying in consistently. Standard Chartered, the British multinational bank, is one notable institution that has doubled down on its previous Bitcoin price forecast, which can be considered one of the boldest price predictions made thus far. According to the international bank, Bitcoin is on track to hit the $500,000 price mark before President Donald Trump exits office. Notably, the current president’s second term, which began on January 20, 2025, will elapse on January 20, 2029. As such, the bank is optimistic that Bitcoin could build enough momentum over four years to attain a 358.926% increase in value. Geoffrey Kendrick, the global head of Digital Assets Research at Standard Chartered, points to a rise in institutional interest as a catalyst for a long-term price boom. “The 13F data from the US Securities and Exchange Commission supports our core thesis that Bitcoin will reach $500,000 before Trump leaves office. Bitcoin is attracting a wide range of institutional players.” Kendrick asserted. According to the SEC , Form 13F is a “statutory directive” created to inform the public about the securities holdings of leading institutional investors. Kendrick explains the significance of the data, stating the following; “The quarterly 13F data is the best test of our thesis that BTC will attract new institutional buyer types as the market matures, helping the price reach our USD 500,000 target level.” He added. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is kicking off the new week on a lukewarm note, with bulls failing to hold above the $110,000 mark. Although gains sustained over the last 7 days are up 5.70%, hourly losses sit at 0.08% during this report.

To this end, he noted that the success of the native coin is largely a function of its community’s strength. Hougan reached this conclusion after attending a Ripple event recently in Las Vegas. Bitcoin Success is Not a Threat to XRP The Bitwise CIO posted about his return from the XRP conference event on X, noting that approximately 1000 were in attendance. Reacting to the May 31 post, Vijar Kohli, an X user who doubles as a financier at Golden Door, asked him if there were any good takeaways from the event. Houghan mentioned that members of the Ripple community gradually understand that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ripple-associated XRP serve different markets. He made sure to establish that the success of Bitcoin is not a threat to XRP. “BTC thriving doesn’t disrupt what XRP aims to achieve,” Hougan clarified. In the wake of the event, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse attempted to foster unity between the two blockchains. This led him to say that the Bitcoin community is not an enemy. Ripple Says Bitcoin is Environmentally Friendly Ordinarily, such a statement would be expected to mend the broken fence between both communities. Eventually, it seems like it has achieved little to nothing. As part of the broader effort to appreciate Bitcoin’s progress, Chris Larsen, Ripple co-founder, says he now views Bitcoin as sufficiently environmentally friendly. He took this stance after the share of mining powered by renewable energy topped 50%. It is worth noting that Larsen was backing a Greenpeace campaign targeting Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm. Some Bitcoin enthusiasts think the statement of the Ripple executive is just a tactic to fix reputational damage. Bitwise XRP ETF Awaits SEC Approval In other related matters, Bitwise is still awaiting the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decision on its spot XRP Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). It first filed an S-1 registration statement for this offering in October 2024. The proposed ETF was intended to track the value of XRP without direct exposure to crypto risks. Bitwise named BNY Mellon its trust’s administrator and Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC, the custodian of the XRP ETF. There is still a prospect of approval from the SEC.

2025-06-01T21:59:21,"$300 SOL Price Target in Play as Next Signal Awaited","Solana (SOL) is witnessing vigorous on-chain activity as it waits for a new bullish signal from the larger crypto market. The sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is all set to target the $300 level in the near future as it tries to take control of its destiny. According to popular crypto analyst Don on X (formerly Twitter), technical indicators show that the major digital asset is set to reach this important milestone in the coming months. 14-Day Price Action SOL is changing hands below the $175 level at press time. Here is its price action from the last two weeks: Image Source: TradingView SOL has been relatively steady overall during this period. Still, the bulls could have done much better, because premier cryptocurrency Bitcoin posted a new All-Time High (ATH) of $112,000 about a week ago. The move was expected to kickstart the next altcoin season, but it didn’t as BTC dropped slightly in value and is now hovering around $108,000. A definitive move ahead from the top cryptocurrency by market capitalization is likely to create a spark for other digital currencies to follow. SOL has been unable to break free of the $200 price resistance recently, but for these smaller coins, a jump like that doesn’t take much time, especially if the right conditions present themselves. The Solana bulls must wait for the opportune moment before striking. SOL Showing Strong Growth SOL will likely be a major part of this highly anticipated bull market. The programmable digital currency ecosystem remains one of the most sought-after networks for developers because of its immense capability and growing acceptability. The Solana blockchain’s Total Value Locked (TVL) is now nearing $10 billion and showing no signs of slowing down. A recent development involves Solana Strategies, a Canadian company specializing in capital raising through the Solana blockchain. The blockchain firm recently filed for a $1 billion preliminary short-form base shelf prospectus to increase financial flexibility and capitalize on emerging opportunities. In simple terms, the move will allow the organization to raise massive funds for various financial instruments it intends to offer via the SOL blockchain. The move indicates the growing acceptance of Solana in the capital markets, which is a significant advantage considering its relatively subdued overall performance in the cryptocurrency market.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/300-sol-price-target-in-play-as-next-signal-awaited/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING","Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana",cryptocompare

2025-06-01T21:18:07,"Significant Cryptocurrency Bill Unveiled in South Korea – Expected to Pass Easily","The South Korean National Assembly is preparing to take an important step towards the legalization of tokenized securities (Security Tokens, ST). The bill, which is expected to pass after the election, has caused great activity in the financial sector. The country's leading financial institutions are rapidly establishing collaborations and continuing technical infrastructure preparations in order to be pioneers in this new market. Tokenized securities are known as digital securities supported by blockchain technology. Thanks to the security and ease of transaction offered by this technology, it is possible to divide low-liquid assets such as real estate, works of art, and even live animals into small shares and offer them to investors. Currently, tokenized securities remain in a gray area due to a lack of regulation. However, both main candidates running in the presidential election, Lee Jae-myung and Kim Moon-soo, have made it clear in their campaign promises that tokenized securities will be legalized quickly, making the bill’s passage almost certain. Related News: Michael Saylor Gives Another Bullish Signal That He Will Buy Bitcoin: Here's How Much BTC He Currently Owns The fact that tokenized securities are both based on real assets and have the status of a security has led to a serious consensus among political parties in this area. This makes it easier for the law to pass. According to industry representatives, this digital asset class is seen as “the safest innovation.” With the passing of the law, an increase in tokenized investment products based on familiar assets such as real estate is expected in the short term. In the long term, it is predicted that the market structure will change radically as traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds, become tokenized. These blockchain-based digital securities promise to lower transaction costs by reducing dependence on centralized intermediary institutions, while enabling automatic transactions powered by artificial intelligence thanks to their programmability. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-01T21:03:00,"Majority of Crypto Users Start With Meme Coins Before Expanding Portfolios: Gemini Report","Over the last year, meme coins have garnered significant attention in the space, attracting high trading volumes and generating returns of several thousand percent in a matter of hours in some cases, despite being highly controversial. These often-viral assets are doing more than just making headlines. Meme Coins Spark Broader Crypto Participation According to the latest report titled “State of Crypto” by Winklevoss twins-led crypto exchange Gemini, meme coins are encouraging newcomers to explore the digital asset industry. This was found after conducting a survey of 7,205 consumers in the US, UK, France, Italy, Singapore, and Australia (approximately 1,200) consumers per country. A large majority – a whopping 94% – of meme coin holders also hold other types of cryptocurrencies, suggesting that meme coins act as a bridge into the broader crypto ecosystem. Many users appear to begin their journey with these tokens before branching out. For example, 31% of US investors who own both meme coins and traditional cryptocurrencies say meme coins were their first crypto purchase. That trend is similarly reflected in Australia and the UK, which trailed with 28% each, followed by Singapore with 23%, Italy with 22%, and France with 19%. Interestingly, France also leads in overall meme coin ownership, with 67% of its crypto investors holding at least one. The trend continues across other regions with Singapore at 59%, Italy at 58%, the UK at 57%, the US at 55%, and Australia at 45%. Europe Leads Crypto Ownership Zooming out, crypto ownership has grown steadily across multiple regions following the 2022 market downturn. Europe reported a notable rise. In 2025, 24% of UK respondents said they owned cryptocurrency, up from 18% in 2024. France saw a similar rise, with ownership increasing to 21%, also from 18% the previous year. Analysts attribute this growth in part to a more favorable regulatory climate in Europe, driven by the phased rollout of the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework over the last two years. Singapore recorded the highest rate of crypto ownership among the surveyed countries, with 28% of respondents reporting they hold digital assets. In the United States, President Donald Trump’s recent crypto-friendly policies are also influencing public sentiment. After vowing to support digital assets during his campaign, Trump has launched a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, restructured the SEC toward a more innovation-driven stance, and backed legislation aimed at regulating stablecoins and broader crypto markets. Additionally, he introduced a Trump-branded meme coin, which reached nearly $3 billion in market cap this month. These developments appear to be boosting confidence among potential investors. Nearly 23% of non-crypto owners in the US said the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve made them more confident in crypto’s value. Trump’s initiatives are having an international ripple effect on attitudes toward digital asset investment, as 21% of non-crypto owners in the UK and 19% in Singapore echoed a similar sentiment.

2025-06-01T20:58:48,"Elon Musk said X is launching XChat with Bitcoin-style encryption","Elon Musk announced on Sunday through a post on X that the platform is rolling out an entirely new messaging tool called XChat. According to Elon, the new feature includes end-to-end encryption, disappearing messages, support for any file type, and cross-platform audio and video calling without requiring a phone number. He said it’s built in Rust, powered by “Bitcoin-style encryption”, and developed with an entirely new system framework. The feature works across all devices and doesn’t need a SIM card or cellular number to function, which is a huge departure from the way rivals like WhatsApp and Telegram tie accounts to phone numbers. Elon’s approach is built for anonymity, portability, and multi-platform access without depending on mobile carriers. New system uses Bitcoin-grade encryption but faces quantum risk Elon’s reference to “Bitcoin-style encryption” is tied to elliptic curve cryptography, or ECC. This encryption method is what Bitcoin uses to protect transactions and digital signatures. The reason it’s used is because it offers strong protection with far smaller key sizes than older methods like RSA. A 256-bit ECC key can provide similar security to a 3072-bit RSA key, making it faster and less demanding on memory or bandwidth. ECC works based on the math of elliptic curves over finite fields, allowing it to handle key agreements, digital signatures, and encryption through a structure that’s tough to break using traditional computing. But researchers are raising new concerns about how long ECC will actually stay safe. It was once thought that breaking ECC with a quantum computer would take an insane amount of resources, but recent breakthroughs show that it could actually be cracked 20 times faster than originally believed. That brings up questions about how secure XChat will be in a few years when quantum machines mature. The problem lies in what’s called the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem, which ECC relies on. If a system could reverse that problem quickly, like a quantum computer might, it would make it easier to break into encrypted conversations or spoof digital signatures. For now, it’s still a solid cryptographic standard, but the clock is ticking on how futureproof it really is. Cryptographic structure inside XChat built around elliptic curve protocols XChat’s security system appears to use a mix of ECC-based schemes. One is the Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) protocol, which helps both users create a shared private key without ever sending it across the internet. Then there’s ECIES, which is what handles the actual message encryption using that shared key. Together, they make sure messages stay private from end to end. For verifying who’s sending what, XChat could use ECDSA, the same digital signature method Bitcoin uses. There are also advanced options like EdDSA, which uses a different type of curve known as twisted Edwards curves and also allow for faster and more secure signature verification, which would come in handy for large-scale messaging apps. The system is also capable of handling things like ECMQV, which is a more secure key agreement scheme designed to block fake users from getting in the middle of conversations. And there’s even a possibility XChat might support ECQV implicit certificates, which allow user identities to be confirmed without needing a big centralized public key infrastructure. That kind of system could reduce reliance on big certificate authorities while still giving users verified encryption. All these encryption tools are centered around one idea: you can multiply a number with a point on a curve, but you can’t figure out what the number was just by looking at the result. It sounds simple, but the math is complicated enough that even the best computers in the world can’t brute-force it… well at least not yet. XChat’s codebase is written in Rust, a programming language that’s popular among developers building secure systems. Rust reduces memory-related bugs and is considered safer than older options like C++. Combined with the smaller key sizes and lower power consumption of ECC, that makes XChat optimized for both mobile and desktop use. Whether this setup will hold against quantum attacks is still unknown. But it sure would be interesting to live through regardless.

2025-06-01T20:53:07,"A Massive Amount of Mysterious BTC Was Transferred to Ross Ulbricht, Who Lost All His Bitcoin to the US Government – What Does This Mean?","Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht is back in the spotlight for the first time since he was released from custody following a presidential pardon in January. Released after 11 years in prison, Ulbricht auctioned off his personal belongings four months later and soon received a mysterious Bitcoin transfer worth millions of dollars. Several of Ulbricht’s personal belongings, including ID cards from his prison years, a blank rehabilitation notebook and oil paintings he made while in prison, were put up for sale on the Bitcoin-based auction platform Scarce City. The auction raised a total of 12.31 BTC, or about $1.3 million at current prices. The highest bid was Ulbricht’s last prison ID card, issued just months before his release. It sold for 5.5 BTC (around $600,000). Ulbricht said that a guard asked him not to smile during his ID photoshoot, but he smiled anyway: “My joy comes from within, so I smiled that day, even though I was in prison.” Related News: One of the Big Names in the Cryptocurrency Industry Allegedly on the Brink of Bankruptcy: Rapid Denial from the Company Immediately following the auction, a single transaction of 300 BTC (approximately $31 million) was made to a donation wallet linked to Ulbricht. This large transfer was spotted by Lookonchain and confirmed to have been transferred to Ulbricht’s donation wallet by Arkham Intelligence data. Some commentators suggested that this transaction might not have been a genuine donation at all, but a self-transfer from wallets Ulbricht had access to before his arrest in 2013. More than 2.6 BTC were previously donated to Ulbricht in January, the day he was pardoned by President Donald Trump, in over 170 transactions. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-01T20:41:00,"This $0.07 XRP Alternative Could Surge To Over $5 If The Bitcoin Price Hits $150,000 In 2025","Analysts have outlined bold projections for Remittix (RTX), suggesting that if the Bitcoin price hits $150,000, then the XRP alternative is on track to reach $5. Supporting these claims is Remittix’s real-world utility, presale momentum and strong fundamentals. Remittix is filling the gap XRP left behind by offering innovative solutions to the challenges in global payments. As Bitcoin forms an accumulation launchpad to break its all-time high, all eyes are on this PayFi sensation for explosive returns. Let’s delve deeper! Remittix (RTX): XRP alternative with practical solutions Source: Remittix XRP has been in the front seat in blockchain payments for a long time. Yet with its regulatory concerns and institutional hurdles, many are wondering whether it is still the frontrunner in 2025. In the meantime, Remittix is stepping up by providing a retail-oriented model that gives quick, low-fee crypto-to-fiat payments. While Ripple is focusing on large institutions, Remittix is targeting individuals, freelancers, and businesses involved in global payments. Currently, the Remittix PayFi infrastructure supports instant settlement in more than 30 fiat currencies with easy API integration for merchants worldwide. Trading at $0.0781, Remittix is still in its early stages, but the numbers are already sizable. The project has raised over $15.4 million in presale funding, selling more than 539 million tokens. This impressive performance shows investor confidence, driven by practical solutions, which is cementing its place in the high upside potential conversation. Analysts predict Remittix to reach $5 post-launch, especially if adoption continues at this pace. Early investors have already received more than 400% returns, with crypto pundits calling Remittix the “real-world” version Ripple promised but fell short of delivering. XRP price flashes bearish signals as investors search for higher upside alternatives XRP’s price performance continues to frustrate investors as it flirts with crucial support zones. Despite an earlier breakout in May, the token is now stuck in a narrow range, with the bullish trend weakening fast. Amid this adverse momentum, XRP’s on-chain data shows that a significant chunk of XRP’s circulating supply was acquired at or near its recent price peak. Glassnode data reports that over 70% of XRP’s realized market capitalization was accumulated between late 2024 and early 2025, when XRP rallied to nearly $3.40. Source: Glassnode This setup typically indicates a sharp sell-off for XRP as it shows serious profit-taking actions happening behind the scenes. Adding to these concerns, XRP appears to be breaking down from a bearish flag-like structure that formed after a classic cup-and-handle pattern. Bitcoin price enters accumulation phase for next markup After the Bitcoin price rallied to a new all-time high, it entered a consolidation phase. But unlike XRP, industrial experts believe this is a launchpad for BTC’s next major rally. Notably, the breakout above the upper trendline of its flag confirms the continuation of the prior bullish trend. This pattern indicates strong bullish control, often leading to a second leg up that is roughly equal in length to the flagpole. Source: TradingView Adding to the fire, open interest in BTC futures has also hit an all-time high of $76.06 billion. This record-breaking figure, accompanied by BTC’s soaring price action, reflects heightened market participation and optimism. Conclusion The clock’s already ticking for XRP investors as Bitcoin readies to enter its next bull run. Meanwhile, accumulating Remittix at $0.0781 is a no-brainer with its rare utility, priming it for an explosive run.

2025-06-01T20:01:09,"Latest Rumor Could Spark Massive Bitcoin and XRP Price Rally On Monday","A post from crypto commentator Bitcoin for Freedom (@BTC_for_Freedom) on X has triggered renewed speculation across digital asset markets. The account claimed that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will resign on Monday. The post concluded with a bold prediction of the future of digital assets. In a follow-up , he reaffirmed a $1 million Bitcoin price target for 2025. Powell’s Stance on Monetary Policy The rumor arrives at a pivotal time for U.S. monetary policy and crypto regulation. Powell, whose current term runs through May 2026, has historically resisted political pressure, including recent calls from President Trump to lower interest rates. His stance has often placed him at odds with pro-crypto advocates who argue that tight monetary policy stifles digital asset growth. While he does not see cryptocurrencies as a stability concern for the U.S., many in the crypto space do not appreciate his approach to inflation and interest rates. The Federal Reserve’s series of rate hikes from 2022 through 2024 contributed to a broader risk-averse sentiment, weighing on speculative assets including Bitcoin and XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Why Hasn’t Trump Fired Powell? Powell has maintained his commitment to central bank independence. He resisted speculation that he would yield to political shifts following Trump’s return to office. Despite the resignation of other key officials such as former SEC Chair Gary Gensler , Powell had previously indicated he would remain in his role and fulfill his term. He emphasized that the Federal Reserve’s independence “is a matter of law,” reinforcing the idea that he could not be removed without cause. This resistance led to speculation on ways Trump could remove him from his position without directly firing him. Potential Impact of Powell’s Resignation If the rumor of Powell’s resignation proves accurate, the implications for the crypto space could be substantial. Trump has already signaled a strong pro-crypto posture, most notably through the appointment of Paul Atkins , also known for his crypto-friendly views, as SEC Chair. A vacancy at the Fed would present the opportunity to appoint a central bank leader who favors lower interest rates and a more accommodative monetary policy. Such a shift could act as a powerful catalyst for digital assets. Investors often interpret lenient monetary policy as supportive of risk-friendly environments, where assets like XRP thrive. Trump’s administration has brought many positive changes. He initiated the conclusion of multiple crypto-related lawsuits, including the XRP lawsuit, which is nearing an official settlement . A new Chair with a softer stance on inflation and a willingness to tolerate increased liquidity could reinforce bullish momentum in the crypto market, giving XRP and other U.S.-based assets a major boost.

Analyst Justin Bennett tells his 115,000 followers on the social media platform X that BTC’s retracement will likely drive traders to believe that the bull market is over. According to the analyst, he expects Bitcoin to correct below $100,000 before it ignites a fresh leg up en route to $120,000. “This is the part where everyone gets super bearish, expecting a 2021-style macro top.

As for Bennett’s downside target for BTC, he thinks Bitcoin may bounce at $100,000 or $97,000. “BTC next leg down confirmed. 104,800 flips to key resistance. Support is $100,000. Same outlook for the last nine days.” Source: Justin Bennett/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $104,439. Looking at the broader crypto market, the analyst says he’s keeping an eye on the TOTAL chart, which tracks the total market cap of all digital assets. Bennett believes that TOTAL will correct and find support at $3.04 trillion, which aligns with his expected BTC pullback. “I could be wrong. I’m certainly not always right. However, I’m not sure how some are interpreting this as bullish. Things can change, but right now, sellers are in control.” Source: Justin Bennett/X A bearish TOTAL chart indicates that investors are unloading their crypto holdings.

2025-06-01T19:06:01,"Tron (TRX) Price Recovery Backed by Sharp Drop in VaR and Beta","Tron TRX has maintained strong stability during a period of widespread market turbulence. The tenth-largest cryptocurrency has consistently traded above $0.26 for over two weeks and has managed to retain this level even as global trade tensions rise. This growth amid broader market volatility is supported by a marked decline in key risk metrics. TRX – A Safer Bet? Recent analysis indicates that Tron’s Value at Risk (VaR) has decreased significantly in the past few months. This metric, which measures the potential for losses at a 95% confidence level, now points to a more stable and less risky investment profile, according to CryptoQuant. The simultaneous drop in VaR during a period of price recovery highlighted Tron’s strengthening position in the market. In addition, TRX’s daily rolling Beta against Bitcoin has also declined notably. A lower Beta means that TRX is becoming less sensitive to Bitcoin’s price movements, which essentially suggests a reduced correlation and improved independence from broader market swings. Such a decoupling indicates a shift toward a more mature and stable asset. Together, the lower VaR and Beta metrics suggest that Tron is not only recovering in price but doing so with reduced volatility and systemic risk. “This powerful combination – price appreciation alongside reduced risk and market correlation – positions Tron as an increasingly attractive asset. It highlights a maturing ecosystem and a more robust foundation for future performance.” Stablecoins Pour Into Tron, Drain From Ethereum The current bullish signal in the Tron ecosystem has been building gradually as market participants shifted toward the asset. Lookonchain’s analysis recently revealed that the Tron network has seen a significant inflow of stablecoins, with USDT and USDC balances collectively increasing by $2.12 billion in a span of seven days. On the other hand, the Ethereum network experienced an outflow as stablecoin balances dropped by $2.44 billion over the same period. This divergence highlighted a growing shift in user preference and capital allocation toward Tron, which is likely driven by its lower transaction fees and faster settlement speeds. The development also marked a shift in stablecoin activity as liquidity moved away from Ethereum to Tron. The increased adoption is likely one of the price catalysts playing out on the market now.

By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $105,047 (+0.5%) Market cap $2.19 Trillion Trading volume (24-hour) $56.76 Billion (-38%) Circulating supply 19.86 Million BTC All-time high $111,970; May 22, 2025 All-time low $0.04865; Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $105,327.30 24-hour low $103,826.96 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $105,047 Price Prediction $ 114,923 (11.15%) Fear & Greed Index 50 (Neutral) Sentiment Neutral Volatility 4.71% Green Days 16/30 (53%) 50-Day SMA $ 98,083 200-Day SMA $ 86,943 14-Day RSI 50.28 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin faced a minor upward correction toward $105K.

BTC/USDT Chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $103,050, beginning a bearish trend to $100,443. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin up today? Bitcoin faced a surge in bullish pressure as buyers defended further declines. This pushed the BTC price toward $105K. Will the BTC price reach $100K?

Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Following the US, Pakistan announced its first government-backed strategic bitcoin reserve, marking a notable step towards adding crypto assets into its financial strategy. Bitcoin price prediction June 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance was notably weak, with a 12.5% loss, as per CoinGlass data, marking the worst first quarter since 2018. However, it made a strong comeback in Q2 as in the last few weeks of May, the price of Bitcoin made a new ATH at $111,970. Will Bitcoin continue its upward rally in June? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $113,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $97,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 $97,000 $105,000 $113,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20.

Once the domain of institutions, private credit is now moving on-chain, driven by platforms like Figure and Tradable, and attracting backing from heavyweights like Apollo, BlackRock, and Franklin Templeton.

The sector has grown mostly in the United States where many companies have turned to private credit specialists for financing. These firms are seeking to diversify their borrowing away from banks. Subsequently, some of the biggest banks have launched their private credit funds. Goldman Sachs created the Capital Solutions Group, a business that will provide direct lending solutions. Most recently, State Street partnered with Apolo to launch a new private credit solution.

2025-06-01T18:15:57,"Conor McGregor Reiterates Plan to Establish Irish Bitcoin Reserve","Three weeks ago, former UFC champion and Irish presidential candidate Conor McGregor proposed the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve for Ireland. Fast-forward to May 30, when he took to his X page to reiterate his commitment to ensuring that the country moves towards the strategic Bitcoin reserve. Ireland to Learn From El Salvador’s Bitcoin Strategy In the said post, McGregor pledged a “decentralised blueprint for sovereignty,” citing Germany’s decision to “dropped the ball.” He plans to ensure that Ireland does not follow suit, forgoing the vision of a Bitcoin treasury. Ireland will borrow a leaf or two from El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy playbook based on its statement . “I want to build on the amazing feats president @nayibbukele has achieved in El Salvador,” he hinted, while subtly extending an invitation to the president of the country. “Let’s chat.” McGregor had earlier stated that establishing an Irish strategic Bitcoin reserve is a step towards returning control to the people. I want to build on the amazing feats president @nayibbukele has achieved in El Salvador. Germany dropped the ball – Ireland will not. Using crypto, I plan on establishing a decentralised blueprint for sovereignty. One that others can also adopt to reclaim their nations. I… — Conor McGregor (@TheNotoriousMMA) May 29, 2025 His focus is on nations that have adopted a hawkish stance towards BTC, especially those with a thriving Bitcoin strategy. No wonder he tagged El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele in his X post. El Salvador Refuses to Let go of its Bitcoin Stance The Republic of El Salvador has remained one of the cities with the most substantial grip on Bitcoin. It is primarily recognized as the first country to adopt the flagship cryptocurrency as a legal tender. However, it faced opposition when the International Monetary Fund (IMF) refused to loan it some funds because of its Bitcoin stance. The IMF demanded that El Salvador put a stop to its Bitcoin acquisition. Just when it seemed that El Salvador was about to adhere to the agency’s restrictions, the Central American country added 19 BTC to its holdings in March 2025. Since then, the government has continued to purchase the firstborn coin. Pakistan Plans For a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Pakistan is also mulling the idea of establishing its bag regarding a Bitcoin strategic reserve. A post was shared on X on May 29, affirming that the Pakistani government will create a national Bitcoin wallet to store its reserves safely. The holdings will be for long-term investment, which will not be sold. This brewing stance is also drawing the attention of the IMF, which has not failed to express its stance on Bitcoin reserves.

2025-06-01T17:38:55,"Top Trader Reveals Notable XRP Buy Signal, States His Best Entry Level","Despite optimism in the broader crypto market, one leading analyst is holding off on accumulating XRP, citing a key signal that must first materialize. Daniel Liu, a respected market commentator known for his work under the VirtualBacon alias, believes XRP is still lacking the final condition that would make it a compelling buy. In a detailed analysis shared in his May 30 video update, Liu addressed XRP’s recent underperformance and explained why the ongoing consolidation phase may be constructive for the asset in the long term. However, he made it clear that he is still waiting for a major confirmation before reentering. My buy signal for $XRP is a further 20 percent drop against $BTC . This would either come from XRP falling while BTC holds, or from BTC rallying while XRP stays flat. Both cases push XRP into a strong value range. It’s a mid-cycle pattern we’ve seen before, and it often… pic.twitter.com/PAtLo49Cq4 — VirtualBacon (@VirtualBacon0x) May 30, 2025 A 22% Retracement Could Trigger Liu’s Buy Signal Liu pointed to XRP’s recent 37% decline from its January high as a normal pattern for strong-performing altcoins that surged early in the bull cycle. These coins, he said, typically correct against Bitcoin as the cycle progresses. He anticipates XRP will resume outperforming Bitcoin but not until it undergoes another 22% correction. According to Liu, “The XRP/BTC ratio chart will retrace 22% if Bitcoin stays steadily above $100,000 and XRP corrects 22% against the dollar.” Under this scenario, XRP could fall to around $1.85, a price he identified as his optimal entry point. Liu added that $1.85 is the lowest value he expects for XRP in the current cycle. He also noted that XRP has already tested its demand zone seven times since December, each time rebounding strongly. That zone, he suggested, is becoming increasingly reliable as a support level. Alternative Path to Liu’s Buy Trigger Liu also proposed a second path that could trigger the same XRP/BTC retracement. In this case, XRP would remain mostly flat around its current price, while Bitcoin would rally another 22% to reach new highs. The net result would still be a 22% decline in XRP’s ratio to Bitcoin. Liu argued that in such a scenario, many investors may lose confidence in XRP’s ability to outperform. He commented, “Market users took a similar position against Solana and Ethereum a few months back, only for the assets to stun them with face-melting rallies.” This kind of disbelief, he implied, often precedes significant upside. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Only after this retracement—whether through a direct XRP correction or a Bitcoin-led divergence—would Liu consider XRP a strong buy relative to Bitcoin. Until then, he is remaining cautious. Bullish Outlooks Remain While Liu’s strategy is conservative, other analysts remain firmly bullish. Notably, Peter Brandt has called XRP “everyone’s favorite.” Within the XRP community, several prominent figures have issued ambitious price targets for the asset. Researcher SMQKE recently predicted that XRP could surpass Ethereum in market value this year, a move that would imply a rally to at least $6. Meanwhile, analyst Egrag Crypto has outlined targets of $13 and even $22 for XRP, referencing a “bullish engulfing” pattern on the yearly chart. He added that he expects a strong “13th candle performance” for XRP during this market cycle. Although there is growing enthusiasm for XRP’s long-term potential, Daniel Liu’s current stance highlights the importance of timing and market positioning. His forecast suggests that while XRP may ultimately experience a powerful rally, a specific retracement—either through a direct price drop or a Bitcoin surge—is needed to confirm a low-risk, high-reward entry point. Until that condition is met, Liu is not ready to call XRP a buy. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Pete Rizzo, host of the Supply Shock podcast, described the prospect as “THE BITCOIN PODCAST OF THE CENTURY.” BREAKING: BILLIONAIRE MICHAEL SAYLOR JUST FORMALLY ASKED TO GO ON THE JOE ROGAN PODCAST THE #BITCOIN PODCAST OF THE CENTURY. IT'S HAPPENING 🔥 pic.twitter.com/cDja5KA6Lu — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) May 31, 2025 Saylor’s public outreach is a strategic move to reach Rogan’s massive audience, which spans millions of listeners across multiple platforms. The Joe Rogan Experience consistently ranks among the world’s most popular podcasts. It also offers major reach for discussing complex topics like cryptocurrency. A conversation between Saylor and Rogan would likely cover fundamental Bitcoin ( BTC ) concepts. And Saylor’s expertise in explaining Bitcoin’s value proposition in accessible terms could prove valuable for listeners unfamiliar with cryptocurrency fundamentals. You might also like: Crypto VC funding: $161m floods startups as token prices sway Why it matters Saylor has been one of the most vocal corporate advocates for Bitcoin adoption. Strategy also holds over $60 billion worth of the cryptocurrency. During a recent CNBC interview , Saylor highlighted his vision for the crypto industry and stressed the need for clear regulatory definitions of four distinct asset classes. Saylor advocated for legal frameworks that would distinguish between digital commodities like Bitcoin, digital currencies such as regulated stablecoins, digital securities including tokenized stocks, and digital tokens that could serve as utility instruments for businesses. Saylor stressed that proper regulatory clarity could unlock the industry’s massive growth potential. He also suggested that clearly defined categories would allow the sector to expand by factors of 100 or even 1,000. Rogan has previously shown interest in cryptocurrency topics, though he has not yet featured a dedicated Bitcoin-focused episode with a major industry figure. In 2023, the comedian called Bitcoin the most “fascinating” cryptocurrency and a top contender to become a universal viable currency. Rogan also praised Bitcoin’s limited supply and decentralized mining as key strengths. OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman, Rogan’s guest at the time, agreed.

2025-06-01T17:15:16,"Polkadot Ran Strong in 2021 But Qubetics Is Being Counted Among Top Crypto Asset Picks in 2025","What if you could go back and invest in Bitcoin in 2010, Ethereum in 2016, or Polkadot in 2020? Chances are, you’d do it in a heartbeat. But in the fast-moving world of crypto, these moments don’t knock twice. The frustration of missing out on life-changing returns is familiar to many. If you’re still searching for the next big win, then it’s time to pay attention. There’s one name being echoed across crypto circles in 2025 — Qubetics . Qubetics is fast emerging as a top crypto asset, and its momentum is impossible to ignore. Built to eliminate one of blockchain’s most notorious bottlenecks — interoperability — Qubetics brings a unified solution that enhances data flow and decentralized utility across networks. Its current presale has created serious buzz among savvy investors, who understand what’s at stake: a real shot at joining a next-generation protocol before its mainnet hits in Q2 2025. With rapid stage changes and discounted pricing, urgency isn’t optional — it’s essential. Qubetics Is Building Momentum as a Top Crypto Asset — Don’t Miss This Stage Missing Qubetics ’ earliest phases is a decision many regret. When the $TICS presale kicked off in September 2024, investors had access to tokens at just $0.01. That window is gone — and so are multiple low-cost stages that offered unbelievable ROI potential. Still, this top crypto asset hasn’t escaped affordability just yet. Qubetics is currently in Stage 36 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.3064. The project has already secured over $17.5 million in funding, with more than 514 million tokens sold and a growing holder base of 27,300+ — clear signs that momentum is building fast for this top crypto asset. With only seven days between each stage and a 10% price hike as stages progress, the urgency to act is palpable. Investors can still secure a 10% discount at the current price before the next shift. At the current rate, $2,000 gets you 6,528 $TICS tokens. If the token hits $1 post-presale, that equates to $6,528 — a 226.32% ROI. But the real excitement builds when projecting post-mainnet prices. At $5, it becomes $32,640 (1,531.58% ROI). If Qubetics climbs to $10, you’re looking at $65,280 (3,163.16% ROI). And if it hits $15? You’re staring at $97,920 — a whopping 4,794.74% return. These projections are not just promising, they’re transformative for early participants in this top crypto asset . The core strength of Qubetics lies in its real-world application. One of its most impressive utilities is interoperability — solving a crucial pain point in blockchain. Most blockchains operate in silos, unable to communicate seamlessly. Qubetics integrates networks like Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin under a singular framework, enabling asset transfers, smart contract executions, and cross-platform operations without friction. For businesses, this means supply chain systems on different blockchains can exchange data securely and in real-time. For developers, it translates to wider market reach and app functionality across multiple chains. And for users, it’s the difference between fragmented experiences and cohesive engagement across DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise-grade dApps. This isn’t theoretical — it’s already being built. Polkadot Had Its Moment, But the Spotlight in 2025 Belongs to Others Polkadot took the crypto world by storm in 2021 with a unique vision for interoperability. Launched through a highly anticipated ICO at just $0.29, the asset reached an all-time high of $55.09 — delivering astronomical returns for early believers. The DOT ecosystem gained popularity for its parachain auctions and scalable multi-chain infrastructure, earning it a top-tier position among layer-0 protocols. By 2022, institutional money and individual investors alike had their sights set on Polkadot, which quickly became a darling in the decentralized tech movement. However, much of that explosive growth is now history. While DOT continues to be a respected player in the interoperability space, it’s no longer the lone innovator. The crypto landscape of 2025 demands more: seamless user experiences, broader integration capabilities, and sustainable tokenomics. Polkadot’s early-mover advantage gave rise to impressive milestones, but new projects — ones with clearer utility and better strategic positioning — are stealing the limelight. Today, investors are no longer just chasing name recognition; they’re chasing relevance. And that’s shifting attention toward newer entrants with superior execution and opportunity. The Verdict: Qubetics and the Rise of a New Top Crypto Asset The world of crypto doesn’t reward hesitation — it rewards insight backed by action. Qubetics is earning its reputation not just as another presale, but as a top crypto asset with utility, vision, and community-driven potential. With its presale in full swing and a mainnet on the near horizon, this isn’t just a concept — it’s an emerging standard. And while Polkadot’s 2021 run was unforgettable, 2025 is shaping up to be the year Qubetics commands the spotlight. Those seeking the next major opportunity should consider this a strong call to action. This is the time to join this top crypto presale while the numbers still make sense and the ROI potential remains exponential. Crypto doesn’t pause, and Qubetics isn’t waiting either. The next phase is always just seven days away — are you ready for it?

2025-06-01T17:00:08,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) Likely Price if Bitcoin Hits $4.87 Million by 2040","The possibility of Bitcoin reaching $4.87 million by 2040 is drawing attention not only for its implications on BTC itself but also for the potential impact on other digital assets. One such asset is Shiba Inu (SHIB), which has demonstrated a notable correlation with Bitcoin’s price action since its inception. If Bitcoin sees this predicted level of growth, Shiba Inu could also experience significant appreciation in value. SHIB and Bitcoin Price Action Correlation Recent data highlights Shiba Inu’s close alignment with Bitcoin in terms of price action. Over the past 30 days, the token has shown a correlation coefficient of 0.72 with Bitcoin, according to analytics from IntoTheBlock . In about 60 days, this correlation reached 0.86, indicating a stronger connection between the two cryptocurrencies. This high degree of correlation means Shiba Inu often mirrors Bitcoin’s market movements, sometimes with amplified effects. For example, a modest increase in Bitcoin’s price may result in a greater percentage gain for SHIB. Therefore, a dramatic increase in Bitcoin’s price could serve as a strong catalyst for Shiba Inu (SHIB). Projected Value of SHIB if Bitcoin Reaches $4.87 Million A recent forecast from analysts at cryptocurrency platform Changelly places Bitcoin’s average price at approximately $4.87 million by January 2040. This figure represents a 4,400% increase compared to its current price of around $105,000. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Using this projection as a benchmark, ChatGPT applied the same percentage increase to Shiba Inu’s current value. If SHIB were to follow a similar growth trajectory, its price could reach approximately $0.000632. With its circulating supply remaining at around 589.25 trillion, this implies a market capitalization of $372.4 billion, up from its current market cap of $8.27 billion. Additional Forecasts from Grok AI Another artificial intelligence model, Grok, incorporated predictions from various sources, such as CoinCodex, Changelly, Coinpedia Markets, and Telegaon, to develop a more comprehensive outlook for Shiba Inu by 2040. According to Grok’s analysis, SHIB may trade within a conservative range of $0.00001911 to $0.054 by 2040. The AI model also proposed a mid-range price forecast between $0.00002157 and $0.076, while offering a highly optimistic scenario in which Shiba Inu could trade between $0.0000310 and $0.089. These projections consider not only SHIB’s correlation with Bitcoin but also potential internal developments , such as token burns, growth within the ecosystem, and favourable market sentiment. Despite these promising forecasts, Grok emphasized the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. While historical data and correlations provide useful insights, long-term predictions remain speculative and subject to numerous variables. Shiba Inu’s future may hinge significantly on both broader market conditions and its ecosystem developments.

Georgia-based LexisNexis Risk Solutions (LNRS) says 364,333 customers are affected, according to a new filing with the Office of the Maine Attorney General. The firm says an unknown attacker breached the systems of a third-party platform that LexisNexis uses, exposing various customer data, including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, postal details, Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers. “On April 1st, 2025, we learned that on December 25th, 2024, an unauthorized third party acquired certain LNRS data from a third-party platform used for software development. The issue did not affect LNRS’s own networks or systems.” LexisNexis is a global data and analytics firm that helps companies manage risks, enhance compliance, prevent fraud and improve operational efficiency. The firm says it promptly sent letters to affected customers to provide more information on the security incident while offering free credit monitoring and identity protection services for 24 months. For now, LexisNexis says it is taking steps to review and revamp its security protocols to avoid a potential repeat of the incident. The firm is also urging customers to be on the lookout for any suspicious activity that may indicate fraud or identity theft.

In fact, the last three years have seen a 1000% increase in the money lost to scammers via Bitcoin ATMs. 30,000 Unregulated Bitcoin ATMs in the US Bitcoin ATMs resemble traditional ATMs but are designed to accept cash in exchange for digital assets. Once this action is completed, the converted money in digital currencies is transferred to a designated crypto wallet. Often, scammers leverage this concept to cheat unsuspecting victims out of their funds, and their activities are increasing at an alarming rate. Crypto consumers claim to have lost more than $114 million through this method in 2023 alone. Scammers prefer this Bitcoin ATM method because of its anonymity and the immediacy of fund delivery. The US currently has the largest number of Bitcoin ATMs, and quite a number of them are unregulated. Australia Records 29-month Streak of Monthly Bitcoin ATM Additions As the number of Bitcoin ATMs in America increases, so does it in other regions. In December 2024, Australia reported a record of 1,359 Bitcoin ATMs operating in its jurisdiction. At the time, this figure represented about 3.5% of all crypto ATMs worldwide. According to Statista data, the number of Bitcoin ATMs globally was over 38,299 as of May 1, 2025. Even with the increasing occurrence of scams, the number of Bitcoin ATMs will likely keep spiking. Tactics Employed by Bitcoin ATM Scammers To deceive users of the Bitcoin ATM, the bad actor usually poses as a law enforcement agent, a government official, or technical support personnel. They create a story strong enough to scare the crypto enthusiast, and then add a tone of urgency to ensure that the victim takes immediate action. On one occasion, a 66-year-old South Carolina-based retired health care worker was told by a scammer posing as an officer with the Beaufort County Sheriff’s Office that she was in contempt of court for missing jury duty. The scammer claimed that there was an arrest warrant out for her. She was told she could pay a $7,500 bond through a Bitcoin ATM to stay out of prison. At another time, a breach could reveal customers’ personal details.

2025-06-01T16:21:30,"These Metrics Are Overheating While Bitcoin Remains Bullish: CryptoQuant","Bitcoin (BTC) is well within a bull market, but certain metrics suggest that the cryptocurrency may have reached a short-term top. This means that BTC may experience a significant price correction before another rally ensues. A report from the market analytics platform CryptoQuant revealed that the metrics that appear to be overheating are those pertaining to Bitcoin’s demand growth. Regardless, Bitcoin’s overall conditions remain bullish, and the CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index is at 80. Historical data shows BTC has continued to rally, provided the index remains above 50. Demand Metrics Are Overheating CryptoQuant analysts report that BTC balances held by whales have increased by 2.8% over the past month. They also estimate Bitcoin’s demand growth to be at 229,000 BTC within the same time frame. This figure is close to the demand growth recorded in December 2024 at 279,000 BTC when the cryptocurrency surged past $100,000 for the first time. Such paces often precede a slowdown in whale accumulation, and as analysts always say, BTC needs strong demand to sustain a rally. Additionally, the Bitcoin Traders’ Unrealized Profit Margin has approached a level that often indicates potential resistance for prices. According to historical data, bitcoin’s price surge tends to slow down whenever the metric nears 40% or crosses below its 30-day moving average, which is currently at 19%. At the time BTC rallied past $111,000 last week, the margin hit 32%. This means it got close to 40%, which is the level marked for overheating. Bitcoin Falls Below $104K Analysts believe $120,000 could be the next major resistance level for BTC if it continues to rally. This is because $120,000 is the upper band of the Traders’ On-chain Realized price – here, the unrealized profit margin sits at 40%. Historical data indicate that this upper band has consistently served as a key resistance during bull markets. While BTC still faces the possibility of a continued rally, the asset had fallen below $104,000 at the time of writing. Data from CoinMarketCap showed BTC was down 2% in 24 hours, tumbling from the $105,000 level. Meanwhile, analysts have revealed that BTC investors have been realizing some profits following the recent price surge, but at moderate levels compared to past markets. Hence, there is no evidence to suggest that the bull cycle is ending; in fact, market conditions indicate continued strength in bitcoin’s upward trajectory.
