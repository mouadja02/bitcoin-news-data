2025-06-02T16:55:15,"‚ÄòRevenge Tax‚Äô Hidden in President Trump‚Äôs Bill Could Trigger Capital War, Warns Deutsche Bank: Report","Deutsche Bank is reportedly warning that a capital war could be triggered by the White House‚Äôs ‚ÄúOne Big Beautiful Bill.‚Äù Analysts from the bank have dubbed Section 899 of the bill a ‚Äúrevenge tax‚Äù that could hurt the attractiveness of US assets, Fortune reports . The bill aims to implement tax reforms, reduce government spending and advance elements of President Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù agenda. Says George Saravelos, head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, ‚ÄúWe see this legislation as creating the scope for the US administration to transform a trade war into a capital war if it so wishes, a development that is highly relevant in the context of today‚Äôs court decision constraining President Trump on trade policy‚Ä¶ It is not unreasonable for the market to conclude that if the President is constrained on using trade policy, taxing foreign capital could be a new means of leverage.‚Äù Saravelos says that the provision attempts to use taxation on foreign investors as leverage to advance American economic priorities, and only has to meet a low bar before being enforced. Elias Haddad, a strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., also told Bloomberg that the bill would ‚Äúdeter foreign investment.‚Äù ‚ÄúA foreign tax provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is alarming‚Ä¶ If the bill as presently written takes effect, it would deter foreign investment in US assets at a time when the country faces increasing reliance on foreign capital to finance its ballooning debt.‚Äù Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-02T16:45:46,"Expert Says $10,000 XRP Holders Will Soon Tell This Millionaire Story","Edoardo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy, recently presented a compelling perspective on what he believes will shape the success narratives of XRP investors in the years ahead. In a post shared on X, Farina stated that early holders of XRP who made significant personal and financial sacrifices will one day be regarded as visionaries, even though the mainstream may attribute their eventual success to mere chance. Farina remarked that future observers might hear stories such as, ‚ÄúYears ago, I sold my car to buy 10,000 XRP,‚Äù and assume these investors were simply fortunate. However, he emphasized that this overlooks the effort and conviction required to invest in XRP at a time when confidence in its potential was not widespread. According to Farina, these individuals will not have achieved their success through luck, but rather through belief and the willingness to take risks. One day, those who got rich from XRP will say, ‚ÄòYears ago, I sold my car to buy 10,000 XRP.‚Äô And the world will call them lucky, without understanding the risk it took. ‚Äî EDO FARINA üÖß XRP (@edward_farina) May 28, 2025 The Importance of Early Commitment Despite strong fundamentals and notable developments in adoption, XRP has remained below its all-time high of $3.84, recorded over seven years ago. Currently trading near $2, the asset continues to face resistance even as other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, advance to new all-time highs. This has tested the patience of long-term holders, particularly those who anticipated far higher returns based on projections of $10, $100, or even $1,000 per XRP. Farina suggests that accumulating 10,000 XRP‚Äîan investment that could have cost approximately $5,000 just months ago‚Äîmight one day lead to significant wealth. If XRP were to reach $100 per unit , holders at this level would achieve millionaire status. Farina has encouraged the crypto community to aim for this threshold, warning that current prices may soon be out of reach. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Support for the Narrative Farina‚Äôs message received support from others within the XRP community who also view early investments as a matter of conviction rather than luck. One X user, Fiora, responded, saying , ‚ÄúOn the surface, it seems to be ‚Äúlucky and rich‚Äù, but in fact it is the result of early believers taking risks that ordinary people cannot bear.‚Äù This comment aligns with Farina‚Äôs position, reinforcing the idea that many early investors made bold choices that most people would have been unwilling to take. Counterpoints from the Community However, not all reactions were supportive. A user identified as Sun Shine questioned the optimism surrounding XRP‚Äôs long-term potential. In their comment, they stated the coin has not been earning for the longest time, drawing attention to the asset‚Äôs prolonged underperformance in comparison to its peers. This criticism highlights the broader frustration felt by some holders who expected higher returns by now. Farina‚Äôs belief that statements like ‚ÄúI took the risk and bought 10,000 XRP‚Äù will become part of future millionaire success stories underlines a larger debate within the crypto space. While some see XRP as a long-term investment built on vision and endurance, others remain skeptical due to its stagnant price action. Nonetheless, Farina and his supporters continue to assert that risk-takers who committed early will eventually be recognized not for their luck, but for their foresight and persistence.

2025-06-02T16:34:42,"Hackers Drain Force Bridge in $3M Crypto Heist","Force Bridge, a Nervos Network-based cross-chain platform, had suffered a significant crypto heist. Announced on June 2, the Web3 security company Cyvers said the hackers stole over $3 million of crypto assets. This attack comes just days after Magickbase, a key Nervos partner, announced plans to shut down the bridge due to low activity and high maintenance costs. Hackers Struck Force Bridge Before Shutdown Plans According to Cyvers‚Äô X post, the hackers drained over $3 million across multiple digital assets. The hackers stole 257,800 USDT, 539.09 Ethereum, worth about $1.35 million, and 898,300 USDC. The bad actors reportedly siphoned 60,400 DAI and 0.79 wrapped Bitcoin, worth around $83,000. After the theft, Cyber revealed that the stolen funds were quickly converted into Ethereum. The criminals also used Tornado Cash, a crypto-mixing tool known for laundering stolen funds . The system hides the funds‚Äô transactions, making tracking difficult. Magickbase, the Singapore-based infrastructure firm that helps manage Force Bridge, quickly stepped in. The team paused the bridge to prevent further damage and confirmed an ongoing investigation in an X post. This incident came just two days after Magickbase announced that Force Bridge would be shut down. The reason was low user activity and high costs of keeping the bridge running. The shutdown plan was shared in a notice published on May 31. This decision may have signaled a vulnerability window to attackers. What Is Force Bridge? Nervos Network launched in 2019 and created Force Bridge, a tool for moving crypto between different blockchains using smart contracts and token wrapping. This innovation makes trading and sharing easier between blockchains. A group called Magickbase helps build and manage the Force Bridge. They support developers and make sure the system works well. Nevertheless, security experts have warned that bridges are susceptible to attacks. These bridges use smart contracts to lock tokens on one chain and issue new ones on another. If these contracts have weaknesses, hackers can manipulate the system and siphon large amounts of crypto. The Bigger Problem with DeFi Crypto Heist Force Bridge is not the only bridge that has been hacked. Many decentralized finance (DeFi) bridges connecting different blockchains have suffered major attacks in recent years. In 2022, hackers stole $600 million from the Ronin Bridge , which disrupted its operations at the time, and $323 million from the Wormhole Bridge. In 2024, Orbit Chain similarly lost over $81 million. Just like in the Force Bridge case, the attackers used Tornado Cash to hide their stolen crypto. In April 2025, hackers failed to break into LayerZero‚Äôs Stargate bridge. This shows that security remains a big problem for DeFi bridges.

A filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under number 001-42210 shows the firm wants to use this purchase to support its growth outside Hong Kong. Reitar Logtech says the move updates its treasury strategy and helps it handle changing financial conditions. By adding Bitcoin to its reserves, the company aims to back further development in its logistics technology platform. The SEC filing makes clear that digital currency will serve both as a store of value and as a way to react to shifts in global markets. Kin Chung Chan, Director, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer of Reitar Logtech, signed the document submitted to the SEC. The company states that investing in Bitcoin is intended specifically to strengthen its logistics technology business. ‚ÄúThis strategic treasury diversification initiative underscores our commitment to maintaining a strong financial foundation while scaling our global logistics technology platform,‚Äù said Reitar Logtech Chairman and CEO John Chan, according to the filing. He added, ‚ÄúBy exploring Bitcoin treasury allocation, we aim to fortify our financial position while aligning with digital transformation trends in the supply chain industry. This potential initiative provides enhanced flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions and expand into new markets.‚Äù Reitar announces BTC acquisition while Strategy buys again On the same day, Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) announced it purchased 705 BTC at a cost of $75.1 million. Strategy now holds 580,955 BTC, with a total value of over $60 billion. Despite these moves, Wall Street remains skeptical. This week, Trump Media said it would raise $2.5 billion to buy Bitcoin, and GameStop announced a $500 million Bitcoin investment. A newcomer, Twenty One, backed by Tether, SoftBank, and Strike‚Äôs Jack Mallers, launched with plans to hold 42,000 BTC from the start, which would make it the third-largest corporate Bitcoin holder worldwide. Shares of Trump Media fell more than 20% after its announcement, while GameStop‚Äôs stock dropped 17%.

2025-06-02T15:56:35,"Magickbase and Cyvers sound the alarm about Nervos breach","In what seems to be a security breach, the Nervos Network‚Äôs cross-chain bridge, Force Bridge, has been reportedly taken over by a suspicious account, which has so far resulted in the theft of approximately $3 million in digital assets. The breach is the latest incident where the vulnerabilities of a blockchain‚Äôs interoperability solutions have been exploited, raising concerns about the security of cross-chain protocols. Magickbase and Cyvers sound the alarm about Nervos breach One of the first alerts came from Magickbase, a developer of Nervos-integrated desktop wallet software. In a post shared on X (formerly Twitter), the team said it had picked up on unusual activity on Force Bridge and immediately shut down related services to protect users. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve detected abnormal activity on #ForceBridge and have paused the service as a precaution. Our team is investigating,‚Äù Magickbase wrote, assuring its users that more information would be shared as it becomes available. Shortly after the post, blockchain security firm Cyvers Alerts published a more detailed breakdown of the breach. According to their analysis, a suspicious address has taken over the bridge and launched unauthorized movement of assets out of the Nervos network. üö®ALERTüö®Our system has detected multiple suspicious transactions involving @NervosNetwork . A suspicious address appears to have taken control over the bridge, stealing ~$3M in assets: 257.8K $USDT 539.09 $ETH 898.3K $USDC 60.4K $DAI 0.79 $WBTC All funds were swapped to $ETH and‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/jA3EZVpTeN ‚Äî üö® Cyvers Alerts üö® (@CyversAlerts) June 2, 2025 So far, the only communication from Nervos itself has been a repost of Magickbase‚Äôs initial warning. According to Cyvers, the attacker converted the stolen tokens into Ethereum and began funneling the funds through Tornado Cash, a crypto ‚Äúmixer‚Äù that scrambles transaction trails to make the origin and destination nearly impossible to trace. This kind of laundering is all too familiar, and Tornado Cash has increasingly been used as a go-to tool for cybercriminals looking to clean stolen funds. And once the money hits Tornado, recovery becomes a long shot. A bigger problem in the blockchain world Unfortunately, this incident is just the latest in a growing pattern. Cross-chain bridges have become some of the most attacked pieces of infrastructure in the crypto ecosystem. High-profile hacks like those on the Ronin and Binance bridges have made headlines; other exploits, like those involving Orbit Chain, Socket, and ALEX bridge, have also cost users millions of dollars over the past year. Force Bridge was supposed to be part of Nervos Network‚Äôs broader vision of secure, scalable blockchain interoperability. The network has been widely praised in the past for its hybrid design, combining Bitcoin‚Äôs UTXO model with smart contract functionality. In a 2024 Messari report , Nervos CKB was even called a potential ‚Äúgame-changer‚Äù for blockchain programmability. But as this breach demonstrates, even technically sophisticated networks are only as secure as their most exposed component. This has also brought to light the ongoing debate surrounding the use of tools like Tornado Cash . The argument that it offers legitimate privacy benefits for users may not continue to hold water with its continuous use by bad actors to launder large amounts of stolen funds and complicate tracking efforts.

Nervos Network's Force Bridge Hacked: Over $3 Million in Crypto Stolen According to security researchers, the attackers seized approximately 257,800 USDT, 539.09 ETH (about $1.35 million), 898,300 USDC, 60,400 DAI, and 0.79 wrapped Bitcoin worth approximately $83,000. Most of the stolen assets were converted to Ethereum and transferred through the Tornado Cash mixer, which is often used to cover up the tracks. Following the attack, infrastructure company Magickbase, which makes significant contributions to the Nervos ecosystem, announced that it has stopped its bridge service and launched an investigation. The company made a statement on June 2 on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) stating, ‚ÄúOur team is investigating the incident.‚Äù Singapore-based Magickbase is known as one of the main partners providing infrastructure support to Nervos Network‚Äôs developers and users.

Nervos Network, whose mainnet was launched in 2019, aims to increase cross-chain interoperability and create an integrated blockchain ecosystem with tools such as Force Bridge. DeFi bridges like Force Bridge work with smart contracts and ‚Äútoken wrapping‚Äù technologies that allow for the transfer of assets and data between isolated blockchains, but these systems are frequently subject to hacker attacks due to their complex structures and security vulnerabilities. Notable past examples include the Ronin Bridge attack in 2022, where $600 million was stolen, and the Wormhole attack, where $323 million was stolen.

The move quickly drew attention across the crypto community. Specifically, some speculate that the coins could be part of Ulbricht‚Äôs hidden Silk Road stash, suggesting a self-donation. However, crypto investigator ZachXBT pushed back on these claims. According to him, the funds originated from wallets that utilized Jambler, a centralized Bitcoin mixing service.Likely Source of the 300 BTCZachXBT revealed that the addresses had histories dating as far back as 2014 and 2019 and had remained dormant until activity resumed between April and May 2025. Both addresses deposited significant amounts into Jambler shortly before the 300 BTC donation was sent to Ulbricht.ZachXBT explained that while the transaction probably isn't a self-donation, as some have alleged, it raises concerns due to its origin from a flagged address associated with questionable sources. He also emphasized that privacy-focused users typically opt for decentralized mixers, not centralized ones like Jambler.https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1929378278214906145Meanwhile, it‚Äôs worth noting that Ulbricht has already cashed out the disputed 300 BTC.

If achieved, Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization would expand to around $3.97 trillion, assuming the circulating supply remains constant.Bitcoin Dad, who refers to himself as a Bitcoin millionaire, previously stated that price gains stem from ‚Äúmath, patience, and research.‚Äù On May 8, he reminded his followers that Bitcoin still trades below $1,000,000, reinforcing his belief that it remains early in the asset‚Äôs adoption cycle. When asked about a $450,000 EOY projection from another market commentator, he indicated he would acknowledge being wrong if that figure materializes.A Shared Target for Bitcoin PriceOther analysts also support this Bitcoin projection. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan has projected a $200,000 price by the end of 2025. On May 14, he outlined multiple drivers behind this view, including inflows into spot ETFs, growing corporate interest, and recent government initiatives. According to Hougan, ETFs acquired over 500,000 Bitcoin in the previous year, significantly outpacing the 165,000 new coins mined annually.Meanwhile, the U.S. government holds over $17 billion in Bitcoin. A recent executive directive now tasks the Secretaries of the Treasury and Commerce with sourcing more Bitcoin without using taxpayer funds. Reports also confirm that Abu Dhabi purchased $460 million worth of Bitcoin in the form of BlackRock's IBIT, and other governments are reportedly exploring similar allocations.Analysts Maintain Long-Term Bullish TargetsIn addition to Hougan and Bitcoin Dad, multiple market figures have issued parallel forecasts. Bernstein analyst Gautam Chhugani reiterated his firm's $200,000 Bitcoin projection by 2025.¬†Elsewhere, Fred Krueger, a mathematician with a PhD from Stanford, posted on X that Bitcoin could reach a new all-time high within the week. Earlier in April, he assigned a 77% probability to Bitcoin achieving a new all-time high by 2025.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/02/bitcoin-dad-says-market-is-boring-but-optimistic-for-200k-target-by-year-end/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-dad-says-market-is-boring-but-optimistic-for-200k-target-by-year-end,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Market|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare

2025-06-02T15:41:50,"Bitcoin Stall as Ethereum Leads $286M Weekly Crypto Investment Inflow","Bitcoin pauses and XRP stalls again, as Ethereum surprisingly leads crypto investment fund flows with a cumulative weekly inflow surpassing $300 million. James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, disclosed the cryptocurrency investment funds' weekly flow in a blog post on Monday. The report shows that these vehicles, which offer exposure to digital assets, recorded a net inflow of $286 million in the previous week.The positive flow extends the streak of crypto investment products to seven weeks, with their last outflow in mid-April. Remarkably, the funds have accrued a total of $10.9 billion during this impressive run, bringing the year-to-date total to $11.13 billion.Ethereum Dethroned Bitcoin Last WeekTypically, investment vehicles that track the performance of Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, lead the proceedings weekly. However, Ethereum‚Äôs resilience in the face of market uncertainties and recent positive sentiments saw it emerge as the top performer last week. Specifically, Ethereum investment funds raked in $321 million in the week between May 26 and June 2, continuing their strong investor traction. The inflows took their weekly streak to six weeks, the best run since December 2024.Meanwhile, Ethereum funds have now recorded an MTD inflow of $889.5 million and a YTD of $1.4 billion. Generally, vehicles tracking the altcoin king now have a cumulative $14.3 billion in assets under management (AUM).Furthermore, Bitcoin‚Äôs streak ended last week, as funds tracking the asset saw mild outflows. The products had been on a six-week streak, bringing in $9.6 billion during the run, before last week's $8 million net outflow.Butterfill highlighted the funds‚Äô strong start to the week, before a macroeconomic headwind from the New York court's declaration that the United States‚Äô tariffs were illegal. Nonetheless, the asset maintains a healthy MTD inflow of $5.5 billion and $10.2 billion YTD.For XRP, its outflow streak extended to two consecutive weeks. XRP-based funds recorded a net outflow of $28 million, further suggesting caution among investors towards the asset, which had been on an 80-week inflow streak until two weeks ago.Other major flows saw Sui and Solana investment products draw in 2.2 million and $1.5 million, while users pulled $3.6 million and $2.4 million from Short Bitcoin and multi-asset funds, respectively. Inflows per Asset Inflows per Asset Remarkably, the net AUM across crypto investment funds reduced last week despite the $286 million inflow. For context, it dropped from its all-time high of $187 billion to $177 billion, as asset prices reduced within the week.Other Countries Step UpMeanwhile, according to regional flows, the United States, as is typical, led inflows, attracting $199 million. These numbers are meager compared to last week‚Äôs massive inflows, which were spurred by the performance of Bitcoin spot ETFs.Nonetheless, other countries showed serious momentum. For instance, Hong Kong's inflows improved from $3.3 million two weeks ago to $54.8 million the previous week, with Germany‚Äôs $42.9 million also surpassing the previous week's inflows.Australia recorded a net inflow of $21.5 million, while Switzerland, Sweden, and Brazil continued their poor run of form.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/02/bitcoin-stall-as-ethereum-leads-286m-weekly-crypto-investment-inflow/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-stall-as-ethereum-leads-286m-weekly-crypto-investment-inflow,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|XRP","Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today|Latest Ethereum (ETH) News Today|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today",cryptocompare

According to the Congress trade filings, Gill purchased up to $850,000 worth of Bitcoin across six transactions, reported on May 30, 2025. Receive Signals on US Congress Members' Stock Trades Stocks Stay up-to-date on the trading activity of US Congress members. The signal triggers based on updates from the House disclosure reports, notifying you of their latest stock transactions. Enable signal The trades occurred on January 29, February 27, May 13, and May 18, with the earliest made more than 120 days before being reported, well past the 45-day deadline mandated by law. The STOCK Act requires lawmakers to disclose transactions over $1,000 within 45 days. Violations can lead to ethics investigations and fines, though penalties are often minor, typically $200, and frequently waived by ethics officials. Violating the Stock Act Gill is among a growing list of lawmakers who have violated the STOCK Act. In many cases, members of Congress have blamed delays on ignorance, clerical mistakes, or errors by accountants. Interestingly, such violations only attract standard fines of just $200. In addition to Bitcoin, Gill reported trades in the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) and Treasury-only government securities (TOIXX), both filed on the same day. Gill‚Äôs sizable exposure to digital assets comes as the U.S. moves toward clearer cryptocurrency regulation following President Donald Trump‚Äôs return to office.

2025-06-02T15:38:43,"Monero price eyes $500, but $420 stands as the next key hurdle","Monero price rose for three consecutive days as investors bought the dip following last week‚Äôs crash. Monero ( XMR ) climbed to $365, its highest point since May 28, and now sits 16% above its lowest level from last week. The rebound happened even as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other cryptocurrencies wavered. It happened as the demand for privacy coins like Horizen ( ZEN ) and Zcash ( ZEC ) jumped. On-chain data shows that Monero‚Äôs exchange outflows surged to $8.9 million last week‚Äîthe largest jump this year. Exchange outflows typically indicate that investors are moving tokens into self-custody, a potentially bullish signal. Monero‚Äôs funding rate has remained positive since May 15, suggesting that traders expect future prices to be higher than the current spot price. A positive funding rate is often viewed as a bullish catalyst, as crypto.news reported . You might also like: Best XRP rivals to buy for the next crypto bull market Monero token has been in a strong bullish trend in the past few months after spending three years in a consolidation phase. This rebound happened after a US court ruled against the Treasury Department for sanctioning Tornado Cash, a crypto mixer. The department was then forced to remove sanctions earlier this year. XMR‚Äôs momentum further accelerated after hackers reportedly used the coin to move over $300 million in suspected stolen funds. Monero is considered ideal for illicit transactions due to its privacy-enhancing features, including ring signatures, stealth addresses, and ring confidential transactions. These technologies ensure transaction anonymity. For example, ring signatures obscure the sender by blending their signature with decoys, while stealth addresses generate a one-time address for each transaction, further masking recipient details. Monero price technical analysis XMR price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that XMR has been in a sustained bull run since February 2024, when it was trading at $100.90. The token remains above both the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages. It has rebounded to $366 from last week‚Äôs low of $312. The Relative Strength Index and the MACD have all pointed upwards. For the rally to continue, Monero must break above resistance at $420, its highest point this year. A successful move above this level would invalidate the double-top pattern, whose neckline sits at $312, and could signal a further rally toward $500. Conversely, a drop below the $312 support would invalidate the bullish outlook.

2025-06-02T15:27:24,"Navigating the World of Cryptocurrency Trading: Tips and Platforms to Consider","Cryptocurrency has gone from being a fringe interest to a central player in financial markets. It‚Äôs no longer just a conversation topic for tech enthusiasts. Today, trading digital assets is something individual investors, institutions, and even governments are watching closely. Image But with the rapid rise of the crypto market comes a whole lot of noise. New platforms, new coins, constant volatility, and endless headlines. It can feel overwhelming, especially if you're just getting started. That‚Äôs why understanding the landscape and knowing what to look for in a trading platform is more important than ever. The Rise of Cryptocurrency Trading The early days of crypto were mostly about buying and holding. Bitcoin was the big name, and the idea of trading it like a traditional asset wasn‚Äôt mainstream. That changed fast. As more people realized the potential of digital currencies, a full-blown market emerged. Trading volumes exploded. New tokens hit the scene. And platforms began offering tools that looked a lot like those used in forex or stock trading. This shift marked the beginning of cryptocurrency trading as a serious, fast-paced, and highly speculative activity. Now, traders can go long or short, use leverage, access real-time charts, and manage portfolios all within the crypto ecosystem. More importantly, it's not just about Bitcoin anymore. Ethereum, Solana, and dozens of other coins are actively traded every day. Each one moves differently, driven by unique tech developments, partnerships, and global news. For traders, this variety means opportunity, but also the need for constant learning and awareness. What Makes Cryptocurrency Trading Unique? Trading crypto isn't quite like trading stocks or commodities. Yes, it still involves buying and selling, watching charts, and managing risk. But a few things make it stand apart: ‚óè 24/7 market ‚Äì Unlike traditional markets, crypto never sleeps. Prices move day and night, even on weekends and holidays.‚óè High volatility ‚Äì Price swings are common, sometimes sharp, and often driven by headlines, social media, or market sentiment.‚óè Lack of central control ‚Äì No central bank or government controls most cryptocurrencies. That decentralization is part of the appeal, but also adds uncertainty.‚óè Security and storage ‚Äì You‚Äôre not just thinking about price: you also need to consider how your assets are stored and protected. These factors create both risk and opportunity. For some traders, the fast pace and non-stop movement are what make crypto exciting. For others, the lack of predictability is a reason to stay cautious. Key Features to Look for in a Trading Platform With hundreds of platforms out there, picking the right one can be a challenge. But a good platform does more than let you buy and sell. It supports your strategy, keeps you informed, and helps protect your funds. Here are a few things to consider when choosing a crypto trading platform: ‚óè User experience ‚Äì Is the interface clean and easy to navigate? Can you find what you need without digging through menus?‚óè Security measures ‚Äì Look for strong encryption, two-factor authentication, and cold storage options.‚óè Asset variety ‚Äì A broader selection of coins can help you diversify and take advantage of more market opportunities.‚óè Trading tools ‚Äì Real-time charts, technical indicators, and order types like stop-loss or take-profit are essential for active traders.‚óè Educational resources ‚Äì Some platforms offer tutorials, market updates, and analysis, which are helpful for both beginners and experienced users.‚óè Fees and spreads ‚Äì Transparent pricing matters. Check what it costs to enter and exit trades, especially if you‚Äôre trading frequently. Not every platform will offer everything. It depends on your goals. Beginners might value simplicity and learning materials, while advanced traders may want deeper analysis tools and faster execution. Comparing Popular Platform Options Choosing the right platform can shape your entire trading experience. With so many available, it helps to understand how different types cater to specific needs and skill levels. Platforms for Beginners Beginner-focused platforms are typically built with simplicity at their core. They often feature uncluttered interfaces, clear buy and sell options, and minimal distractions. This allows new traders to focus on the basics without being overwhelmed by advanced tools they may not need just yet. In many cases, these platforms also include helpful resources like tutorials, quick guides, or FAQs to explain common terms and functions. Some even offer demo accounts where you can practice trading without using real money. For someone taking their first steps into cryptocurrency trading, this type of environment can make the learning curve far less intimidating. Platforms for Experienced Traders More advanced users usually want something that gives them greater control and insight. Platforms designed for experienced traders tend to offer more in-depth features, including real-time market data, customizable charting tools, and advanced order types like stop-limit or trailing stop orders. Speed and precision also matter here. These platforms typically focus on delivering fast execution and access to deeper liquidity, which can make a difference when working within narrow margins or reacting quickly to market changes. While the interface might be more complex, that complexity comes with added flexibility, which seasoned traders often value. All-in-One Multi-Market Platforms Some traders don‚Äôt just want access to crypto. They‚Äôre also looking to manage trades in forex, indices, or commodities from a single place. This is where multi-market platforms stand out. These platforms allow users to diversify their trading strategies without switching between services. Being able to monitor different asset classes side by side can help traders make more informed decisions, especially during periods of high market correlation or volatility. One platform that takes this approach is ThinkMarkets . It offers both cryptocurrency and traditional market access in one integrated environment. For traders who like the idea of managing everything in one account, from crypto positions to index trades, this type of setup brings added convenience and versatility. Staying Ahead with Market Trends Several factors can cause sudden price changes. Regulatory announcements are one of the biggest. If a government tightens or loosens its stance on crypto, the market reacts immediately. A single statement from a financial authority can cause major shifts, especially for larger coins. Blockchain upgrades are another key influence. For example, when a popular network like Ethereum undergoes a major update, traders and investors closely watch to see how it affects fees, transaction speed, and scalability. If the changes are positive, the price may rise. If they‚Äôre poorly received, it might do the opposite. Adoption news also plays a major role. When digital currencies are integrated into major payment platforms or used by well-known companies, confidence in the asset tends to grow. This usually pushes demand higher, especially among long-term holders. Even activity from large crypto holders, sometimes referred to as ‚Äúwhales,‚Äù can influence the market. When these big players move large amounts of coins in or out of wallets, traders take notice. It often signals that a big move is coming, and many people act accordingly. Stay Informed, Trade with Intention Successful traders pay attention to this type of information and learn to read between the lines. They understand that price action isn‚Äôt random. It‚Äôs the result of news, sentiment, and larger economic patterns. Having access to timely updates and solid market analysis can give traders the edge they need to respond quickly and make better decisions. The key to success isn‚Äôt finding shortcuts or guessing which coin will skyrocket next. It‚Äôs about staying informed, using the right tools, and approaching each trade with a clear purpose.

2025-06-02T15:21:23,"Czech Minister Steps Down, Opposition Calls for Govt to Resign Over $46M in BTC ‚ÄòDonated‚Äô from Convicted Criminal","The Czech Republic has been shaken by a Bitcoin scandal. On Friday, Justice Minister Pavel Bla≈æek resigned, with the opposition set to demand the resignation of the coalition government this week as well. The situation caught on fire at the end of last week after Bla≈æek, a conservative politician, accepted a large donation in BTC and sold it for about $45.8 million in March, the AP reported . The opposition has raised concerns over the source of the donation . Bla≈æek received the coins from Tomas Jirikovsky, a convicted criminal. Jirikovsky operated the Sheep Marketplace . In 2017, he went to prison for embezzlement, drug trafficking, and illegal trading of weapons. Jirikovsky‚Äôs lawyer reportedly approached Bla≈æek in March 2025, saying his client would donate 30% of his BTC stash to the ministry. Police had confiscated the wallet containing this BTC and returned it to Jirikovsky after his release in 2021.

Jirikovsky probably wanted ‚Äúto repent‚Äù through the donation, he said. He also claimed that courts had not proven that the BTC came from criminal activity. However, the opposition parties argue that it‚Äôs unclear why Jirikovsky gave the coins to the ministry or where the coins came from. They accused Bla≈æek of potential money laundering. Furthermore, they argue that the state shouldn‚Äôt use the money until these points are clear. Meanwhile, the High Prosecutor‚Äôs Office in Olomouc is investigating the case on suspicion of abuse of official authority and laundering of proceeds of crime. Bla≈æek denied knowledge of wrongdoing. Nonetheless, he said he resigned so not to harm the four-party coalition government led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala. The PM said he believed that Bla≈æek acted with goodwill.

The transaction, flagged by blockchain analysts and tracked by platforms such as Lookonchain and Arkham Intelligence, has sparked a wave of speculation across the crypto community.The funds appear to have passed through Jambler, a centralized Bitcoin mixing service, rather than more widely used decentralized privacy tools like Wasabi or Samourai.... Czech Coalition Government in Danger? Today, Brno Daily reported that the lower house will hold an urgent session on Thursday. The opposition parties will use the occasion to demand the resignation of the coalition government, the deputy leaders of the ANO and SPD parties, Karel Havlicek and Radim Fiala, said on Sunday. ‚ÄúWe will want the government to find sufficient self-reflection and resign,‚Äù Havlicek said. The current cabinet could stay until the parliamentary elections in October, but it shouldn‚Äôt have the power to make major decisions. If the coalition government doesn‚Äôt resign, ‚ÄúWe are very strongly considering calling a no-confidence vote in the government.‚Äù Fiala, deputy leader of the far-right SPD, said that his party ‚Äúwill support an extraordinary session‚Äù and a vote of no confidence in the government. However, lower house speaker Jan Skopecek said the opposition‚Äôs plans are just ‚Äútheatre‚Äù in the campaign ahead of the elections. He added that Bla≈æek has already resigned, so there is no reason for the cabinet to do so as well. Moreover, Czech Fiscal Council chair Mojmir Hampl argued that this case raises numerous key technical questions. However, these will not be answered in the pre-election stage. Meanwhile, Le Monde reported that Jirikovsky had been trying to recover about 1,500 BTC, seized by the police, since his imprisonment. During the trial, the court suspected that the coins came from Nucleus . This is a dark web marketplace that, the report claims, shut down the day after Jirikovsky‚Äôs arrest. Source: Arkham Furthermore, BTC market monitors noted that a portion of the Nucleus-linked BTC , dormant since 2016, moved to new wallets in March. This is after Bla≈æek signed the agreement, reports claim. Jirikovsky claimed that he got to keep the BTC because he had obtained it legally. Bla≈æek claimed he hadn‚Äôt made any promises in return for the donation. All these allegations will likely be brought up during the Thursday emergency session.

Today, that scarcity has become one of the key reasons it holds value. For years, people have looked back and said, ‚ÄúI wish I had bought when it was still early.‚Äù But as the market gears up for what could be the most unpredictable cycle yet, a new name is emerging with eerily similar fundamentals‚ÄîBitcoin Solaris. If you missed the ride with Bitcoin, the next best opportunity might just be staring you in the face. Built for a mobile-first world and architected with next-gen consensus mechanics, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) doesn‚Äôt just follow in Bitcoin‚Äôs footsteps‚Äîit upgrades them for the modern age. Live Coin Watch Signals a Shift‚ÄîBitcoin Solaris Grabs Attention Live Coin Watch has become a go-to hub for spotting trends before they explode. Over the past few weeks, one name has been steadily climbing watchlists, gathering traction in user alerts and gaining chatter across social feeds‚ÄîBitcoin Solaris. With its fixed 21 million token supply echoing the fundamentals that made Bitcoin iconic, it‚Äôs no surprise analysts are eyeing it as a potential sleeper giant. Unlike most coins that pop up and fade, BTC-S combines Bitcoin‚Äôs trusted scarcity model with modern tools built for mass adoption‚Äîmobile mining, blazing speeds, and a fully decentralized ecosystem. For many watchers, this isn‚Äôt just another listing‚Äîit‚Äôs a sign of what could become the next major wealth-building movement in crypto.

Its architecture isn‚Äôt just theoretical brilliance‚Äîit‚Äôs performance you can see, feel, and mine. Dual-layer architecture: Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Contribution (PoC) at the base, with an Application Layer powered by Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Time (PoT). Speed you can use: 10,000+ transactions per second and 2-second finality. Energy efficiency: Over 99.95% lower consumption than Bitcoin‚Äôs mining model.

Here‚Äôs what they‚Äôre saying: Crypto Legends : Called it ‚Äúthe next evolution of bitcoin in 2025.‚Äù Crypto Royal : Highlighted the energy efficiency and user-first mining design. Token Empire : Emphasized the cross-chain functionality and presale momentum. Token Galaxy : Focused on the growing referral-powered community traction.

The new structured bonds are available now to a limited group of qualified investors through the over-the-counter market, per a recent press release . Sberbank plans to offer these bonds on the Moscow Exchange soon, aiming to make them more transparent, easier to trade, and accessible to more investors.Details of the Bitcoin-Tied Structured BondsInterestingly, these structured bonds present a unique two-way opportunity. Specifically, investors can benefit if Bitcoin's value in dollars rises and also if the U.S. dollar strengthens against the ruble.¬†In addition, investors don't need a crypto wallet or have to deal with unregulated foreign platforms. All transactions take place in rubles within Russia's legal and financial system. This presents exposure to crypto without stepping outside the country's regulatory framework.Notably, Russia's stance on crypto has continued to evolve in recent years. While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are still banned for everyday payments within the country, they are now legal for cross-border transactions .Meanwhile, the Central Bank of Russia announced a few days back that it now allows financial firms to offer crypto-focused investments to qualified investors. This opened the door for products like Sberbank's new bonds.Moreover, Sberbank confirmed that it is also preparing to launch Bitcoin futures through its investment platform, SberInvestments, on June 4. This move aligns with the Moscow Exchange's launch of crypto-based instruments.¬†Sberbank Dabbling into Crypto Amid a Global TrendInterestingly, this isn't Sberbank's first step into the scene. Since receiving a digital asset license from the Central Bank of Russia in 2022, the bank has issued and exchanged tokenized assets like gold and real estate.¬†It opened its digital asset platform to retail investors in 2023 and has handled billions of rubles in transactions. Sberbank also runs a blockchain network that works with Ethereum, aimed at supporting smart contracts and token creation. It began limited testing in 2022 and opened up public testing in early 2023.Globally, Sberbank's move mirrors a growing trend among top financial institutions. In the U.S., major banks like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup are working on a joint stablecoin project designed to speed up cross-border payments.¬†HSBC introduced a crypto settlement product in Hong Kong, while BNY is investing heavily in blockchain for digital asset custody.

2025-06-02T15:00:37,"Here‚Äôs What The Ripple CEO Had To Say About The Bitcoin Vs. XRP Debate","Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has stressed that members of the Bitcoin community are not enemies of XRP holders. His latest remarks come amid increased discussions , especially on social media, about the relationship between the two large blockchain ecosystems. Speaking at an event in Las Vegas, Garlinghouse argued that Bitcoin and XRP are not competing in a zero-sum game, but rather advancing a shared mission that could reshape the global banking system over the next decade. Garlinghouse Says Bitcoin And XRP Can Both Win Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse directly addressed the perceived rivalry between the two communities while speaking at a recent event in Las Vegas. ‚ÄúThe Bitcoin community is not our enemy. They really are not. If they do well, we‚Äôre gonna do well, we might do better. It‚Äôs not a zero-sum game,‚Äù he told attendees . His comments demonstrate Ripple‚Äôs leadership in positioning XRP not as a challenger to Bitcoin, but as a strong force driving forward a digital transformation. Rather than causing division, Garlinghouse‚Äôs comments advocate for mutual progress, arguing that growth in the Bitcoin ecosystem is not a threat to Ripple‚Äôs success. Although price comparisons have dominated much of the debate, Garlinghouse‚Äôs remarks draw attention to a bigger split in their vision. As the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin was created to challenge the traditional global finance system. On the other hand, Ripple‚Äôs XRP focuses on working within regulatory frameworks to improve cross-border payments among banks. Despite their differences, Garlinghouse suggested both are necessary players in a much larger transformation of the baking industry. A Shared Role In Rebuilding Global Finance Garlinghouse didn‚Äôt stop at defending XRP‚Äôs relationship with Bitcoin; he expanded his vision to the future of the banking system itself. ‚ÄúRewriting the entire banking system and what this looks like in maybe 10 years or 20 years. We underestimate how big that change is and how profound it is, and we get there by being collaborative and working together and not against each other,‚Äù he added. His comments serve as a call for unity as digital assets become increasingly integrated into the global financial system. As such, the message to XRP holders is clear. XRP‚Äôs Success doesn‚Äôt require discrediting or working against Bitcoin. Both assets can rise together if the focus is on adoption and the greater mission in global finance. One such adoption is the recent official launch of both XRP and Micro XRP futures contracts on CME Group. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse took to the social media platform X to mark this move, describing it as a key institutional milestone for XRP. Furthermore, investor optimism for a spot XRP ETF has increased significantly in recent weeks, with the odds of approval by the SEC now sitting at 83%. Meanwhile, XRP is currently trading at $2.16 after rebounding from $2.10 on May 31.

Lee shared his latest price outlook for Bitcoin during an interview on CNBC‚Äôs Squawk Box today, where he discussed the latest market trends for BTC.¬†Lee Remains Confident in Bitcoin Despite Recent Dip¬†During the interview, Squawk Box‚Äôs host Joe Kernen highlighted Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price swings, which saw the asset plunge from its all-time high of $111,970 to the $104,000 mark. Despite the retracement, Lee remained optimistic about the asset's prospects, asserting that Bitcoin is consolidating around this level.¬†He suggested that Bitcoin has great stats, given that 95% of BTC has already been mined. For perspective, roughly 19.87 million Bitcoins, representing around 95% of Bitcoin‚Äôs maximum supply of 21 million coins, are currently in circulation.¬†Despite nearly all Bitcoin currently in circulation, Lee suggested that 95% of the global population does not own BTC. In his view, there is a huge imbalance between Bitcoin‚Äôs demand and supply.¬†Therefore, he speculated that more potential buyers could join the Bitcoin bandwagon over the next 10 years.¬†Bitcoin to Hit $250K By Year-End.¬†As a result, he predicted that Bitcoin has massive upside potential this year. Notably, Kernen asked him whether he still thinks Bitcoin will reach its initial forecast of $150,000 by the end of the year.¬†In response, Lee speculated that Bitcoin could surpass the $150,000 territory and aim for lofty targets of around $200,000 to $250,000. Achieving the $200,000 and $250,000 targets would require Bitcoin‚Äôs price to increase by roughly 92.06% to 140.08% from its current level.Lee Forecasts Bitcoin‚Äôs Terminal Value¬†When asked to forecast Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚Äòterminal value‚Äô after the last Bitcoin is mined by 2140, Lee predicted that BTC would at least match gold‚Äôs valuation of $23 trillion.¬†Based on this projection, Bitcoin could trade at a minimum of $1.15 million, assuming only 20 million BTC are in circulation. The use of 20 million BTC rather than the maximum of 21 million is based on assumptions that the entire total supply will never be in circulation due to the permanent loss of certain portions of the asset.¬†Further, Lee sets bullish terminal targets for Bitcoin, forecasting that it could soar to $2 million - $3 million or even higher. This puts his average terminal target for Bitcoin at $2.5 million, representing a surge of 2,300% from the current value.¬†As previously reported , leading asset manager VanEck also predicted Bitcoin‚Äôs potential rise to the $3 million target. According to Matthew Sigel, VanEck‚Äôs head of digital asset research, Bitcoin will reach the $3 million target by 2050, 25 years from now.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/02/fundstrats-tom-lee-raises-2025-bitcoin-target-to-250k-sets-3m-as-long-term-value/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=fundstrats-tom-lee-raises-2025-bitcoin-target-to-250k-sets-3m-as-long-term-value,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH","Market|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare

2025-06-02T14:54:42,"Today, 13 Years Ago, Arthur Britto Committed This Code that Created the 100 Billion XRP","On this day, thirteen years ago, a pivotal moment in the history of cryptocurrency unfolded, one that would set the stage for what is now one of the most prominent digital assets in the world. As highlighted by respected XRP Ledger validator, Vet, in a recent post on X, June 2 marks the anniversary of when Arthur Britto, one of the key architects behind the Ripple project, committed the code that officially created the supply of 100 billion XRP. This was not just a technical milestone; it was the foundational moment that birthed an entire ecosystem aimed at revolutionizing global payments. Happy Birthday XRP! Today, 13 years ago, Arthur Britto committed this code that created the 100b XRP. https://t.co/Ku748uUAhE ‚Äî Vet (@Vet_X0) June 2, 2025 The Birth of XRP and Ripple‚Äôs Vision Arthur Britto, alongside David Schwartz and Jed McCaleb, envisioned a blockchain-based digital asset that could address the inefficiencies plaguing traditional financial systems. While Bitcoin had emerged a few years earlier as a decentralized peer-to-peer electronic cash system, the Ripple founders saw an opportunity to tackle a different problem: cross-border payments. Existing systems like SWIFT were slow, expensive, and fragmented. The idea behind XRP was to create a digital asset that could act as a universal bridge currency, enabling instant, low-cost transfers across currencies, banks, and borders. The creation of the 100 billion XRP supply, fixed, finite, and pre-mined, was a deliberate design choice. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, where new coins are introduced through mining or staking, all XRP came into existence at once. This approach was intended to ensure predictability, efficiency, and scalability, allowing Ripple to distribute XRP strategically to support network growth and adoption. While this pre-mining model has drawn criticism over the years, particularly from those who advocate for proof-of-work systems, it has also enabled Ripple to forge partnerships with major financial institutions and central banks. Arthur Britto: The Quiet Architect Although much of the public attention has centered on Ripple‚Äôs executive chairman, Chris Larsen, and CTO David Schwartz , Arthur Britto‚Äôs role has been equally foundational. Britto, known for his intensely private nature, was instrumental in the early protocol design and in envisioning XRP‚Äôs scalability for global use. His early contributions, including the fateful code commit 13 years ago, laid the groundwork for Ripple‚Äôs goal of building an ‚ÄúInternet of Value‚Äù, a world where money moves as seamlessly as information does today. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Britto‚Äôs influence extends beyond the original codebase. He remains a key figure behind the scenes, particularly through his work at PolySign, a company focused on institutional-grade digital asset custody. His technical foresight continues to shape the evolution of digital finance, even if he chooses to stay largely out of the limelight. XRP‚Äôs Journey: Triumphs, Challenges, and Resilience Since its creation, XRP has weathered dramatic highs and lows. It became one of the top cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, achieving major exchange listings and becoming a pillar of RippleNet, Ripple‚Äôs enterprise blockchain payment platform. At its peak, XRP‚Äôs price soared to over $3 in early 2018, making early adopters and supporters hopeful of an even greater breakthrough. Yet the journey has not been without challenges. Regulatory scrutiny, particularly from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has cast a long shadow over Ripple and XRP . Despite these legal hurdles, XRP has maintained a loyal global community and continues to see active development, with Ripple expanding its services, including in central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiatives, cross-border remittances, and tokenization projects. The Legacy of a Code Commit What makes Vet‚Äôs reminder so powerful is not just the nostalgia of looking back but the realization of how one code commit can shape an entire technological and financial movement. On June 2, 2012, when Arthur Britto formalized the creation of the XRP supply, he wasn‚Äôt just writing code; he was setting in motion a vision of financial interoperability that still inspires innovation today. As Ripple continues to push forward, whether through legal victories, technological advancements, or new partnerships, the foundational act that took place thirteen years ago remains central. It is a testament to the power of vision, code, and collaboration, and to the enduring ambition of building a financial system fit for the digital age. Happy Birthday, XRP.
