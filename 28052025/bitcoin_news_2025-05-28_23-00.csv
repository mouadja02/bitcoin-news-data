The portability aspect, it's instantly transferable across the globe, whereas gold is bulky and very expensive to ship, the authenticity is instantly verified via the blockchain. You can easily secure Bitcoin in a wallet, whereas gold requires insurance, and it is very expensive.\"" The CEO also cited the absolute scarcity of Bitcoin and the potential for gold's inflation rate to increase due to technological advancements as a factor in favor of choosing Bitcoin over gold for long-term value storage. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen discusses the rationale for the company’s Bitcoin acquisition.

2025-05-28T20:51:11.000Z,"As Miner Revenues Rebound to $50M+/Day, TeraHash Prepares to Unlock Mining Yields for Over 8 Million Users","Bitcoin has officially broken through the $117,000 mark the other day – its strongest rally in months, reigniting interest not only in price speculation but in the infrastructure behind the scenes: mining. As the most popular cryptocurrency surges again, miners have stepped up operations, sending daily exchange inflows to nearly 50 BTC per day, a sharp rise from the 25 BTC daily observed earlier this quarter. While still below historical peaks of 100 BTC/day, this doubling in activity signals renewed confidence among miners – and capitalizing on this trend, investor appetite is following closely. According to recent data, cumulative miner earnings have climbed back to $51.6 million per day, up significantly from local lows and showing potential for further upside. Again, while not yet at the all-time highs of $80 million/day, the current numbers underscore a robust post-halving rebound, and an increasingly competitive market for Bitcoin yield. Amid this backdrop, TeraHash , the soon-to-launch protocol built by one of the industry’s largest mining players, is stepping into the spotlight. Designed to provide simplified access to Bitcoin mining-based rewards, TeraHash removes the need for hardware, hosting contracts, or complex infrastructure. Backed by 8 million early users from its viral Telegram-based mining game HashCats, the protocol is now positioning itself to become one of the largest tokenized mining network in crypto. It offers a hardware-free, on-chain alternative just as global interest in mining surges again. In recent days, that promise has quietly turned into conversation – with growing chatter across Telegram, X, and Discord fueling curiosity and pulling more eyes toward what might be one of the most unconventional protocol launches this cycle. The Low-Key Start to What Might Become the One of the Largest Bitcoin Mining Protocol Amid the flood of Telegram bots, stickers, and trading alpha groups, mini-apps took off in 2024. What started with simple “tap-to-earn” games, like Notcoin and Hamster Kombat, quickly evolved into a new kind of onboarding funnel. With nothing but a few taps, tens of millions of users were interacting with crypto mechanics, often without even realizing it. Some games were speculative, some were just memes, but one of them, HashCats , laid the groundwork for something bigger. This mining-themed simulation, launched in mid-2024, where users upgraded cartoonish rigs, optimized power usage, and managed reward cycles, all while competing for yield with digital cats. But beneath the memes and mechanics was something far more ambitious: a stealth onboarding funnel into one of the most capital-intensive sectors in crypto – Bitcoin mining. Within months, HashCats exploded to over 8 million users, making it one of the most viral mini-apps of the Telegram era. But unlike typical Web3 games, HashCats didn’t just build engagement — it seeded understanding. Players simulated halvings, optimized hashrate, and learned mining dynamics. Behind the scenes, a real mining infrastructure was being assembled. That infrastructure now has a name: TeraHash. The Logic Behind TeraHash’s Simpler Approach to Bitcoin Mining TeraHash offers a different path to mining : access rewards without ever owning a rig. At the heart of the protocol is $THS, a tokenized unit representing 1 terahash per second (TH/s) of live, protocol-operated hashrate. Instead of navigating hardware lead times or energy contracts, users simply acquire $THS and stake it on the platform to get rewards from mining. No machines. No hosting. No downtime. But TeraHash also introduces a second asset, $HASH, born from the HashCats ecosystem, designed to deepen network participation through governance and a clever rewards redistribution mechanism: when users forget to stake their $THS, idle rewards are distributed among those staking $HASH in solo staking format or dual staking together with $THS tokens. Infrastructure With Proof, Not Promises Unlike earlier attempts at tokenized mining, TeraHash commits to verifiability. The team has announced plans for quarterly audits, public dashboards, and proof-of-hashrate attestation, ensuring the number of circulating $THS tokens does not exceed the live hashrate under protocol control. This move aligns with growing scrutiny around transparency in Bitcoin mining, especially as large-scale operations increasingly intersect with ESG debates, sovereign policy shifts, and grid impact concerns. In a recent example, Texas mining hubs reported up to 20% of grid participation during peak hours, renewing calls for both regulatory oversight and more transparent accounting from mining protocols. TeraHash aims to stay ahead of this curve by embedding trust at the protocol level, where every token is verifiably backed, and every reward is traceable on-chain. Bitcoin Mining Could Significantly Evolve in the Months Ahead With its July launch fast approaching, TeraHash is positioning $THS as a new programmable utility token, akin to how ETH represents staking. The team has publicly committed to targeting $5 billion worth of tokenized mining power over the next three years, signaling ambitions not just to participate in the mining market, but to reshape how it’s accessed. Integration efforts are already underway, with discussions around DeFi collateralization, dual-staking models, and wallet-level mining exposure. In essence, TeraHash is launching a token and laying the groundwork for a programmable mining layer, one that could plug directly into the rest of crypto’s capital flows, at the same time. For the 8 million who started by clicking on cartoon cats, and for the many more watching Bitcoin miner revenues rise again, TeraHash represents something new: a way into mining that’s not gated by geography, capital, or kilowatt contracts – just code, tokens, and transparent infrastructure.

2025-05-28T20:50:44.000Z,"Urgent: Bitcoin Options Show Bearish Sentiment as Bitcoin 2025 Kicks Off","BitcoinWorld Urgent: Bitcoin Options Show Bearish Sentiment as Bitcoin 2025 Kicks Off Are you watching the cryptocurrency market closely? As the highly anticipated Bitcoin 2025 conference gets underway, a notable shift is occurring in the derivatives space, specifically within the Bitcoin options market. Recent analysis indicates that traders are adopting a cautious, if not outright bearish, stance. This sentiment is particularly interesting given the historical tendency for major events to inject volatility into the market. What’s Driving the Bearish Sentiment in Bitcoin Options? According to Adam, a respected macro researcher at Greeks.live, the mood among Bitcoin options traders is currently leaning bearish. His observations, shared on the social platform X, highlight a preference for put options, which are contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell Bitcoin at a specified price by a certain date. An increase in demand for put options relative to call options (which bet on price increases) is a classic indicator of bearish sentiment . Traders seem to be anticipating increased volatility around the Bitcoin 2025 conference. Large industry events often serve as catalysts for significant price movements, and it appears options traders are positioning themselves to potentially profit from or hedge against a downside move. Adam noted that many traders are not only holding bearish put positions but are also planning to increase them, suggesting conviction in their outlook. Why is Bitcoin 2025 a Potential Catalyst? The Bitcoin 2025 conference is a major gathering for the crypto community, bringing together developers, investors, companies, and enthusiasts. Historically, such events can lead to: Major Announcements: New product launches, partnerships, or regulatory discussions could significantly impact market perception. Increased Attention: The event draws mainstream and institutional focus, potentially increasing trading volume and price swings. Shifting Narratives: Discussions at the conference can reinforce or challenge existing market narratives, influencing trader psychology. While these factors could theoretically push the price in either direction, the current positioning in the Bitcoin options market suggests a bias towards preparing for a potential downturn or significant turbulence that favors those betting on lower prices. Expert Insights and BTC Price Prediction The analysis from Greeks.live provides a snapshot of this market positioning. Adam’s report underscores that this isn’t just retail speculation; it reflects the sentiment among potentially larger players in the options market. This kind of insight is crucial for understanding the short-term dynamics influenced by sophisticated trading strategies. Interestingly, alongside the general bearish tilt in options, there are specific BTC price prediction points being discussed. Some traders reportedly predict a potential surge first, perhaps reaching highs around $120,000, before a significant correction down to the $102,000 level. This indicates that the bearish view isn’t necessarily a belief in an immediate crash, but rather an expectation of a volatile period that might include an initial peak followed by a notable dip. This ‘up-then-down’ scenario is common in volatile markets and highlights the complex strategies employed by options traders who can profit from movement in either direction, or specifically hedge against unexpected turns after a potential peak. Further reinforcing the cautious outlook, Adam mentioned that algorithmic trading reports also show a slightly bearish outlook. Algorithmic trading systems often rely on quantitative models and historical data to execute trades, and their current positioning suggests that technical indicators or patterns are aligning with a less optimistic near-term view for Bitcoin’s price action. Navigating the Current Crypto Market Analysis What does this crypto market analysis mean for you as a participant? The dominance of bearish sentiment in the options market, especially tied to a major event like Bitcoin 2025, signals a period of potential heightened volatility and uncertainty. It’s a strong reminder that even during periods of potential excitement or bullish long-term outlooks, the short-term market can be heavily influenced by hedging and speculative strategies in the derivatives space. Key takeaways from this analysis include: Options Market as a Bellwether: The options market can offer insights into how sophisticated traders are positioning themselves for future price movements and volatility. Event-Driven Volatility: Major conferences like Bitcoin 2025 are often associated with increased market activity and potential price swings. Conflicting Signals: While some predict potential highs like $120,000, the dominant options positioning is defensive or bearish, anticipating a correction. Algorithmic Confirmation: The slightly bearish stance from algorithmic trading adds another layer to the cautious outlook. For traders and investors, this period necessitates careful risk management. Understanding that a significant portion of the market is braced for potential downside or high volatility is crucial. It might be a time to re-evaluate position sizes, set stop-losses, or explore hedging strategies if you hold significant spot positions. In conclusion, the commencement of Bitcoin 2025 coincides with a distinct shift towards bearish sentiment in the Bitcoin options market. Analysis from sources like Greeks.live points to traders favoring puts and preparing for volatility, potentially involving an initial price surge followed by a correction, aligning with some specific BTC price prediction targets. This comprehensive crypto market analysis underscores the need for vigilance and strategic planning as the market navigates this potentially turbulent period driven by event-specific expectations and sophisticated trading plays.

2025-05-28T20:40:47.000Z,"GameStop Bitcoin Purchase: Shocking 4,710 BTC Investment Revealed","BitcoinWorld GameStop Bitcoin Purchase: Shocking 4,710 BTC Investment Revealed In a move that sent ripples through both the traditional stock market and the cryptocurrency world, GameStop, the iconic video game retailer, has officially announced a significant investment in Bitcoin. The company revealed via its official communication channels that it has acquired a substantial amount of the leading digital asset, marking a notable step into the realm of corporate cryptocurrency holdings. What is the Scale of the GameStop Bitcoin Investment? The core of the announcement is the specific quantity of Bitcoin now held by GameStop. According to the company’s disclosure on its official X account, GameStop has purchased 4,710 BTC. This figure represents a considerable allocation, especially for a company navigating a significant business transformation. To put this into perspective, based on recent market prices at the time of the announcement, this acquisition is valued at tens of millions of U.S. dollars. This makes GameStop one of the public companies holding Bitcoin as part of its treasury reserves. The announcement was concise but impactful, delivered directly to the public and its dedicated community, often referred to as ‘apes’ or ‘redditors’, who have been closely following the company’s journey and have shown significant interest in digital assets. Why Would GameStop Pursue a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy? GameStop’s decision to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several factors could be driving this strategic move: Treasury Diversification: Like many companies, GameStop holds cash reserves. Holding a portion of these reserves in Bitcoin can be seen as a strategy to diversify away from traditional fiat currencies and potentially hedge against inflation or currency devaluation. Alignment with Community: GameStop’s core community is heavily engaged online and often overlaps with individuals interested in technology, disruption, and digital assets. Embracing Bitcoin could resonate strongly with this key demographic, further solidifying their connection to the brand. Exploration of New Technologies: GameStop has previously shown interest in Web3 and NFTs, albeit with mixed results. A direct investment in Bitcoin could signal a deeper commitment to understanding and potentially integrating with blockchain technology in the future. Potential for Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term appreciation potential. GameStop might view this investment as a way to grow its treasury value over time, though this comes with inherent risks. This move positions GameStop alongside other public companies that have embraced a corporate Bitcoin strategy, signaling a growing trend among forward-thinking businesses. How Does GameStop’s Holding Compare to Other Companies with Bitcoin Treasury? While 4,710 BTC is a significant amount for GameStop, it’s helpful to compare it to other major corporate holders to understand its relative scale in the broader landscape of institutional Bitcoin adoption . Companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla are well-known for their substantial Bitcoin holdings. Here’s a simplified comparison (Note: exact figures for other companies fluctuate as they may buy/sell or disclose updates): Company Approximate BTC Holding MicroStrategy > 200,000 BTC Tesla ~ 9,720 BTC GameStop (GME) 4,710 BTC As you can see, GameStop’s holding is smaller than industry leaders like MicroStrategy but is still a notable amount, placing it among a growing list of public companies that have chosen to allocate capital to the digital asset space. This move adds to the narrative of increasing corporate interest in the asset class. What are the Potential Benefits and Challenges for GameStop (GME) Holding BTC? Like any strategic financial decision, holding Bitcoin comes with its own set of potential benefits and challenges for GameStop: Potential Benefits: Potential for Capital Appreciation: If the price of Bitcoin increases, the value of GameStop’s treasury holdings would also increase, potentially boosting its balance sheet. Attracting Tech-Savvy Investors: The move could appeal to investors interested in companies that are forward-thinking and embracing digital technologies. Inflation Hedge Narrative: Many view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation, which could be a factor in protecting the purchasing power of their reserves. Potential Challenges: Volatility Risk: Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile. A significant downturn could negatively impact the value of GameStop’s holdings and potentially affect its financial statements. Security Risks: Holding digital assets requires robust security measures to prevent loss or theft. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, which could introduce unforeseen challenges. Accounting Complexity: Accounting for cryptocurrency holdings can be complex and is subject to specific rules (like FASB updates in the US). GameStop must navigate these complexities carefully as it manages its new GME BTC asset. What Actionable Insights Can We Glean from This Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? GameStop’s entry into holding Bitcoin provides several insights for observers of both the stock market and the crypto space: Growing Corporate Interest: This is another data point suggesting that companies are increasingly considering Bitcoin as a legitimate treasury asset, moving beyond early adopters. Community Influence: For companies with highly engaged, digitally native communities, aligning corporate strategy with community interests (like crypto) can be a powerful factor. Transformation Efforts: GameStop’s willingness to make such a bold move highlights its ongoing efforts to transform its business model beyond traditional retail. Market Signal: While not the largest holder, GameStop’s brand recognition means this move could encourage other companies, particularly those with similar customer demographics, to explore cryptocurrency. This development underscores the broadening appeal of Bitcoin beyond individual investors and dedicated crypto firms, highlighting the trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption . In Conclusion: GameStop’s Bold Step into Bitcoin GameStop’s disclosure of its 4,710 BTC purchase is more than just a line item on a balance sheet; it’s a statement. It signifies the company’s willingness to embrace new financial technologies and potentially align itself more closely with the digital future and the interests of its passionate community. While the amount is modest compared to the largest corporate holders, it represents a substantial commitment for GameStop and adds another layer to the narrative of corporate treasury diversification into digital assets. This move will be watched closely by investors and analysts alike, eager to see how this corporate Bitcoin strategy impacts GameStop’s financial health and market perception in the volatile world of both meme stocks and cryptocurrencies. The integration of GME BTC into the company’s assets marks a significant milestone in its ongoing evolution.

2025-05-28T20:30:04.000Z,"Forex Market Uncertainty: US Dollar Gains Tremble","BitcoinWorld Forex Market Uncertainty: US Dollar Gains Tremble In the dynamic world of global finance, where every ripple can create waves felt in markets from stocks to cryptocurrencies, the recent movement of the US Dollar has caught attention. While it has shown a tendency to edge higher, a cloud of uncertainty looms large over the sustainability of these gains. For those navigating the crypto landscape, understanding the dollar’s trajectory is key, as its strength or weakness often correlates inversely with risk assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. Understanding the Current US Dollar Position The dollar, measured against a basket of other major currencies (the DXY index), has seen periods of modest appreciation. This upward movement is often influenced by several factors: Safe-haven demand during times of global economic or geopolitical stress. Expectations surrounding the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions. Relative economic performance compared to other major economies. However, this Currency strength has not been a one-way street. The gains have been tentative, often reversing course quickly, indicating a lack of strong conviction among market participants. This hesitant performance is what fuels the uncertainty we are currently observing in the Forex market . Why Are US Dollar Gains Facing Uncertainty? The primary drivers behind the cautious outlook for the dollar are multifaceted. Several key elements contribute to this environment: 1. Federal Reserve Policy Ambiguity: The market is constantly trying to predict the next move from the Federal Reserve . Will they cut Interest rates ? When? How many times? The Fed’s communication, or lack thereof, on the future path of monetary policy creates significant volatility and uncertainty for the dollar. 2. Inflation Data Volatility: Recent inflation reports have been mixed. While headline inflation has shown signs of cooling, core inflation remains sticky in some areas. The Fed’s decisions are heavily data-dependent, particularly on inflation and employment. Any surprising data releases can quickly shift market expectations regarding Interest rates , directly impacting the dollar’s value. 3. Global Economic Outlook: The economic health of other major regions (like the Eurozone, China, Japan) also plays a role. If other economies show signs of strengthening or if their central banks adopt more hawkish stances, it can reduce the relative appeal of the dollar. 4. Geopolitical Risks: Ongoing global conflicts and political instability can sometimes boost the dollar as a safe haven, but they can also disrupt trade and economic activity, adding another layer of unpredictability. The Federal Reserve’s Pivotal Role and Interest Rates Perhaps the most significant factor influencing the dollar’s short-to-medium term outlook is the action, or inaction, of the Federal Reserve . The Fed controls the benchmark Interest rates in the United States. Higher interest rates typically make a country’s currency more attractive to foreign investors seeking higher returns on their fixed-income investments, thus increasing demand for the currency. Conversely, expectations of lower Interest rates can weaken the dollar. The current debate revolves around when the Fed will begin cutting rates after a period of aggressive hikes. Market participants are constantly adjusting their forecasts based on every speech by a Fed official and every piece of economic data. This continuous recalibration creates the uncertainty that prevents the dollar from establishing a clear, strong trend. Here’s a simplified look at the relationship: Factor Potential Dollar Impact Higher Inflation Data Could signal Fed holds rates higher longer → Potential Dollar Strength Weaker Jobs Data Could signal Fed cuts rates sooner → Potential Dollar Weakness Hawkish Fed Commentary (leaning towards hikes/holding) Potential Dollar Strength Dovish Fed Commentary (leaning towards cuts) Potential Dollar Weakness Navigating the Forex Market : Implications for Other Assets The uncertainty surrounding the US Dollar has ripple effects across the entire financial system, including the Forex market itself, commodity markets, and digital assets. A stronger dollar makes US exports more expensive and imports cheaper. For international investors, a strong dollar can make US assets, including stocks and bonds, more expensive when converted from their local currency. For the cryptocurrency market, a strong dollar is often seen as a headwind. Cryptocurrencies are generally considered risk assets. When the dollar strengthens, it can indicate a ‘risk-off’ sentiment in the market, where investors prefer the safety of dollar-denominated assets. Conversely, a weakening dollar can signal ‘risk-on’ behavior, potentially benefiting assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The current uncertainty means this relationship is not always straightforward. Periods of dollar strength might coincide with crypto rallies if other factors (like positive crypto-specific news or institutional adoption) are at play. However, the general macroeconomic backdrop, heavily influenced by dollar dynamics and Interest rates set by the Federal Reserve , remains a crucial element to monitor. Key Data and Events to Watch To better gauge the potential direction of the US Dollar and understand the underlying uncertainty, market participants are closely watching specific economic releases and events: Inflation Reports (CPI, PPI): Provide insight into price pressures, directly influencing Fed policy expectations. Employment Data (Non-Farm Payrolls, Wage Growth): Indicates the health of the labor market, another key metric for the Federal Reserve . Retail Sales: Reflects consumer spending, a major component of economic activity. Manufacturing and Services PMIs: Offer a look into the health of different sectors of the economy. Federal Reserve Meetings and Speeches: Direct communication from policymakers regarding their economic outlook and plans for Interest rates . Paying attention to these data points and understanding how they might influence the Fed’s stance on Interest rates is vital for anyone with exposure to the Forex market or risk assets. Challenges and Opportunities Amidst Uncertainty The current environment presents both challenges and potential opportunities. The primary challenge is volatility and unpredictability. Sudden shifts in dollar value can impact investment portfolios quickly. For businesses involved in international trade, hedging against currency fluctuations becomes more complex. However, uncertainty can also create opportunities. Periods of dollar weakness might offer entry points into assets that are typically inversely correlated. For traders, increased volatility in the Forex market can provide trading opportunities, provided they have robust risk management strategies in place. Understanding the interplay between the US Dollar , Federal Reserve policy, and global economic trends is key to navigating these conditions. Conclusion: Awaiting Clarity The US Dollar’s recent move higher is undeniable, but the conviction behind it is weak. The path forward remains clouded by uncertainty, primarily driven by evolving expectations around the Federal Reserve’s approach to Interest rates and the broader global economic picture. While the dollar may continue to see periods of strength, significant and sustained gains appear unlikely until there is more clarity on monetary policy and a clearer global economic trend emerges. Market participants, including those in the crypto space, should remain vigilant, paying close attention to key economic indicators and central bank communications that will ultimately shape the dollar’s direction in the volatile Forex market .

Their aggressive Strategy Bitcoin accumulation has been a major market narrative for years. However, recent reports suggest a shift in pace. Is Strategy’s Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy Changing? According to analysis by The Block, Strategy is indeed continuing its policy of acquiring Bitcoin, but the speed at which they are adding BTC to their balance sheet appears to be moderating. This isn’t necessarily a halt or a reversal, but rather a downshift from the rapid pace seen in previous periods. The company recently announced another significant purchase: 4,020 BTC, acquired for approximately $427 million. While this is a substantial sum, it represents a lower volume compared to some of their previous weekly or monthly purchase figures during peak accumulation phases. This observation raises questions about the factors influencing their buying decisions. Why the Slower Pace for MicroStrategy BTC Buying? Several intertwined factors seem to be contributing to this adjusted pace, as highlighted by the report: Declining Premium on MSTR Stock: Historically, investors looking for exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset often turned to MSTR stock. Strategy’s shares traded at a significant premium over the value of the company’s underlying assets, largely driven by the market valuing the stock based on its large BTC holdings. This premium essentially allowed Strategy to raise capital (often via stock offerings) at a valuation significantly higher than its software business alone, making BTC acquisition through equity financing very attractive. However, this premium has been shrinking. Increased Competition in Institutional Bitcoin Access: When Strategy began its aggressive buying in 2020, direct institutional access to Bitcoin was limited. Now, the landscape has changed dramatically. The approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in major markets has provided investors with a regulated, easily accessible, and often lower-fee alternative to gain BTC exposure. This increased competition means investors no longer solely rely on MSTR stock as the primary vehicle for institutional Bitcoin exposure. The report notes that the premium on MSTR Stock recently dropped to 163%, which is the lowest level recorded since April 8th. A lower stock premium means that raising capital through equity is less ‘efficient’ in terms of acquiring Bitcoin compared to when the premium was significantly higher. This directly impacts the economics of their preferred acquisition method. The Impact of Institutional Bitcoin Competition The rise of spot Bitcoin ETFs and other institutional products has fundamentally altered the market dynamics. Investors who previously might have bought MSTR shares as a proxy for BTC now have direct, regulated options. This diversification of investment avenues for Institutional Bitcoin exposure naturally spreads demand across different products and companies, rather than concentrating it heavily on Strategy’s stock. This competitive pressure reduces the unique advantage Strategy once held in the market for publicly traded companies with significant BTC exposure. While Strategy remains the largest corporate holder by a vast margin, the availability of alternatives dilutes the premium investors are willing to pay solely for the ‘Bitcoin proxy’ aspect of their stock. Strategy’s Current Bitcoin Holdings: A Colossal Figure Despite the recent slowdown in the acquisition pace, Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings remain immense. The company now holds over 580,000 BTC. To put this into perspective, this represents approximately 2.75% of Bitcoin’s total estimated supply of 21 million coins. This staggering figure solidifies their position as the leading corporate accumulator of the digital asset. This massive accumulation started in August 2020 and has continued consistently through various market cycles, demonstrating a long-term commitment to their Bitcoin treasury strategy. Their journey involved various financing methods, including issuing convertible notes and selling stock, heavily leveraging the premium on their shares to fund BTC Acquisition . Understanding the MSTR Stock Premium The premium on MSTR Stock is a key metric for understanding Strategy’s funding strategy. It’s calculated by comparing the market capitalization of Strategy to the value of its Bitcoin holdings plus the value of its core software business. When the stock trades at a high premium, the market is essentially assigning a higher value to the company than the sum of its parts, largely because of the perceived value and scarcity of getting direct, large-scale Bitcoin exposure through a publicly traded company. Here’s a simplified breakdown: High Premium: Market Cap >> (Value of BTC Holdings + Value of Software Business). This makes raising capital via stock sales very attractive for buying more BTC. Lower Premium: Market Cap ≈ (Value of BTC Holdings + Value of Software Business). The advantage of using equity to fund BTC purchases diminishes. The recent drop in this premium suggests the market is recalibrating how it values MSTR, likely due to the new, more direct ways investors can get Bitcoin exposure via products like spot ETFs. This doesn’t mean the premium is gone, but it’s less exaggerated than it was during peak enthusiasm and limited alternatives. What’s Next for Strategy and Corporate BTC Adoption? Strategy’s approach has always been unique due to its scale and consistency. While the pace might slow, their commitment to Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset appears unchanged. Michael Saylor and the company leadership have consistently articulated their long-term bullish view on Bitcoin. The competitive landscape for Institutional Bitcoin is likely to continue evolving. As more traditional financial players enter the space and offer regulated products, the ways institutions and individuals gain exposure will diversify further. This could potentially put continued pressure on the MSTR stock premium over time. However, Strategy’s massive existing holdings mean they remain a significant player and their future moves will continue to be watched closely by the market. Their strategy has inspired other companies, albeit on a smaller scale, to consider adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. The challenges they face now, like managing a lower stock premium and navigating a more competitive investment environment, offer insights into the complexities of being a large-scale corporate Bitcoin holder. Key Takeaways Strategy continues to buy Bitcoin but at a reduced pace compared to historical peaks. The primary reasons for the slowdown appear to be a shrinking premium on MSTR stock and increased competition from new institutional investment products like spot BTC ETFs. A lower stock premium makes raising capital via equity less advantageous for funding Bitcoin purchases. Increased competition from other Institutional Bitcoin avenues dilutes the unique value proposition of MSTR stock as a BTC proxy. Despite the slower pace, Strategy’s total holdings exceed 580,000 BTC, representing a significant portion of the total supply. The company’s long-term commitment to Bitcoin as a treasury asset remains strong, but their acquisition methods may adapt to the changing market conditions. Concluding Thoughts: A Maturing Market? Strategy’s adjusted BTC Acquisition pace is perhaps a sign of a maturing market. As Bitcoin becomes more accessible through traditional financial channels, the unique arbitrage opportunity that Strategy capitalized on via its stock premium naturally diminishes. This shift doesn’t invalidate their strategy but rather reflects the changing dynamics of institutional adoption and investment access. Their journey from being an outlier to a benchmark for corporate Bitcoin strategy highlights the evolving perception and integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. While the road ahead involves navigating new competitive pressures and funding realities, Strategy’s colossal Bitcoin stack ensures they remain a central figure in the narrative of institutional cryptocurrency adoption.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) remains pinned below the breakout level of $109,588, indicating that the bears are fiercely defending the level. Bitfinex analysts said in a market note that profit-taking generally follows after Bitcoin hits a new all-time high after a sharp rally. The report added that a mild retracement or consolidation would be healthy and lay the foundation for the next leg higher. Glassnode had a similar view.

Material Indicators co-founder Keith Alan remains bullish as Bitcoin continues to trade above $100,000, and the whales are accumulating. He expects Bitcoin to find support near the $94,000 level. What are the critical levels to watch out for in Bitcoin and altcoins? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out. Bitcoin price prediction Bitcoin’s failure to maintain above the $109,588 level may have attracted selling by short-term traders. BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bears will try to pull the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($105,453), which is a key level to watch out for. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, it suggests that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. That improves the prospects of a retest of the $111,980 level. If buyers overcome the $111,980 resistance, the BTC/USDT pair could surge to $130,000. Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA could strengthen the bears. The pair could then plummet to the psychologically crucial support of $100,000, which is likely to attract solid buying by the bulls. Ether price prediction Buyers could not push Ether ( ETH ) above the $2,738 resistance on May 27, but they have kept up the pressure. ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The ETH/USDT pair has formed a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a break and close above $2,738. That clears the path for a rally to $3,000 and later to the pattern target of $3,153. This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($2,467). The failure of a bullish setup may trap the aggressive bulls, sinking the pair to $2,323 and below that to $2,111. XRP price prediction XRP ( XRP ) has been trading between the moving averages, indicating a lack of aggressive buying or selling. XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The flattish 20-day EMA ($2.33) and the RSI just below the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price dips below the 50-day SMA ($2.24), the XRP/USDT pair could dive to the $2 support. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $2 level because a break below it may sink the pair to $1.61. On the upside, a break and close above the 20-day EMA opens the gates for a rally to $2.65. Buyers will have to drive the pair above $2.65 to catapult the price to $3. BNB price prediction Buyers pushed BNB ( BNB ) above the $693 resistance on May 27 but could not sustain the higher levels. BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The price action of the past few days has formed a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a break and close above $693. If that happens, the BNB/USDT pair could rally toward the pattern target of $752. The 20-day EMA ($658) is the critical support to watch out for on the downside. A break and close below the 20-day EMA could accelerate selling as the aggressive bulls may cover their positions. That could tug the pair to the 50-day SMA ($622). Solana price prediction Solana ( SOL ) has been consolidating inside a narrow range between the 20-day EMA ($169) and the overhead resistance at $180. SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are booking profits. The SOL/USDT pair could descend to $159 and later to the 50-day SMA ($153), which is likely to attract buyers. If the price rebounds off the 50-day SMA, the pair could swing between $153 and $180 for some time. A break and close above $180 signals the resumption of the up move. The pair could pick up momentum and rally to the $210 to $220 resistance zone. Dogecoin price prediction Sellers are trying to pull Dogecoin ( DOGE ) below the immediate support at the 20-day EMA ($0.22). DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If they succeed, the DOGE/USDT pair could drop to the horizontal support at $0.21. Buyers are expected to defend the $0.21 level with all their might because a break below it could sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($0.19). Such a move brings the large $0.14 to $0.26 range into play. On the contrary, a rebound off $0.21 suggests the bulls are vigorously defending the level. That could keep the pair inside the $0.21 to $0.26 range for a few more days. Cardano price prediction Buyers have managed to keep Cardano ( ADA ) above the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern, but the bounce lacks strength. ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView That increases the risk of a break below the 50-day SMA ($0.70). If that happens, the ADA/USDT pair could plunge to the solid support at $0.60. That suggests the markets have rejected the breakout from the bullish setup. Buyers will have to push the price above the $0.86 resistance to indicate the resumption of the up move. The pair may then rally to $1.01, where the bears may mount a strong defense. Related: SUI price chart hints at 2x rally amid Nasdaq ETF filing Sui price prediction Sui ( SUI ) turned down from the 20-day EMA ($3.66) on May 28, indicating that the sentiment remains negative and the traders are selling on rallies.

If the price rebounds off the 50-day SMA, the bulls will try to clear the 20-day EMA hurdle. If they can pull it off, the pair may rally to the $3.90 to $4.25 overhead zone. On the other hand, a break and close below the 50-day SMA suggests that the bears remain in control. The pair could then plunge to the $2.86 support. Hyperliquid price prediction Hyperliquid (HYPE) turned down from $40 on May 26 and broke below the breakout level of $35.73 on May 28. HYPE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView There is support at $32, but if the level cracks, the HYPE/USDT pair could extend the slide to the 20-day EMA ($30). Buyers will try to start a bounce off the 20-day EMA but may face stiff resistance at $35.73. The first sign of strength will be a break and close above $35.73. That suggests solid demand at lower levels. The bulls will then make one more attempt to drive the pair to the overhead resistance of $42.25. Chainlink price prediction Chainlink ( LINK ) continues to find support at the neckline of the H&S pattern, but the bulls have failed to start a strong rebound. LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The 20-day EMA ($15.66) is flattening out, and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. Buyers will have to push the price above $18 to gain the upper hand. If they do that, the LINK/USDT pair could rally to $19.80. Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below the 50-day SMA ($14.68), it suggests that the markets have rejected the breakout above the resistance line. The pair could then drop to $13.20.

The Trump administration has ordered American companies that develop software used to design semiconductors to stop selling those services to Chinese groups. According to sources familiar with the matter, the US Department of Commerce has told companies such as Cadence, Synopsys and Siemens EDA, which produce Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software, to end their sales to China. This decision was conveyed in official letters sent by the Bureau of Industry and Security responsible for Export Control within the department. However, it is not yet clear whether all EDA companies have received such letters. The move is seen as the Trump administration’s latest effort to curb China’s ability to produce AI chips. In April, the U.S. also restricted exports of Nvidia’s AI chips, which it developed specifically for China.

About 80 percent of the Chinese EDA market is controlled by Synopsys, Cadence Design Systems, and Siemens EDA.

The firm noted that Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $112,000 last week, coinciding with turbulence in traditional markets. The rally also surpassed the previous peak of $109,358 set in January. The report recalled that Bitcoin experienced a sharp correction of 28.2% before reaching this level, falling to $ 74,400 after Trump's “Freedom Day” when he began to impose tariffs. However, according to NYDIG, these corrections are a natural part of the uptrend that started at $ 15,460 in November 2022. Interestingly, NYDIG data suggests that this cycle has been less volatile than previous Bitcoin bull markets. The current cycle has seen losses of 10% or more only seven times, compared to 13 and 10 in the previous two cycles, respectively. What’s more, these declines have been both more frequent and deeper.

Pointing out that Bitcoin has increased 7.1 times compared to closing prices (7.2 times compared to the current high price) since the $ 15,450 bottom seen in November 2022, NYDIG states that a repeat of the 20-fold increases in past cycles is not expected, but there is still significant upside potential. The report noted that perpetual swap and forward rates, which are indicators of speculative activity, are currently well below historical levels, suggesting that the current rally is not fueled by excessive speculation. Additionally, the MVRV ratio currently stands at 2.4x, which is low compared to past cycles. NYDIG notes that this indicator has peaked at 4.0x in previous cycles, but with each new cycle these peaks have trended downward.

2025-05-28T19:18:52.000Z,"Bitcoin Whales Ramp Up Accumulation Despite Pullback Risk","Large Bitcoin holders have spent the week adding to their stacks even as spot prices hover just below April’s all-time peak. On-chain dashboards from Material Indicators reveal a steady uptick in buy orders sized over $1 million, a pattern analysts read as “whales locking in exposure before the next leg.” At the same time, BTC has traded in a narrow $5,000 channel around $105,000, suggesting a bout of consolidation rather than capitulation. “BTC is consolidating above $100k and whales are accumulating,” noted Material Indicators co-founder Keith Alan, pointing to a heat-map of rising bid liquidity clustered at six-figure levels. Analysts flag $94K as first major support Alan’s models place the 21-week moving average—currently near $94,000—as the most likely bounce zone should sellers gain the upper hand. “If a correction comes, I expect support to hold at the trend line which currently has confluence with the 21-Week Moving Average.” That view aligns with historical patterns: previous bull-market pauses have typically retraced to the 21-week curve before resuming their advance. Bull market context tempers correction fears Despite the possibility of a pullback, market structure remains decisively bullish. Bitcoin has printed seven consecutive green weekly candles, a streak rarely seen outside primary uptrends. Funding rates on perpetual futures have cooled, implying less overheated leverage and healthier foundations for another breakout attempt. High-profile trades stir social-media drama Hyperliquid trader James Wynn has amplified volatility by live-tweeting every blockbuster position. “They FORCED the $BTC price DOWN to $108,700,” he wrote after claiming rivals attempted to liquidate a 40x long. Blockchain monitors show Wynn’s latest leveraged bet sitting on an unrealized $3.4 million loss, a reminder that whale theatrics can swing intraday sentiment. Macro signals still favor upside The dollar index slipped this week, and gold’s rally lost steam, pushing some macro funds to rotate back into digital assets. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded their strongest three-day inflow since early May, according to BitTrends data. Meanwhile, Glassnode metrics show dormant supply at a record high, indicating long-term holders remain reluctant to sell into strength. Risk factors traders are tracking CME futures now price a 45 % chance of a Federal Reserve rate cut in September, and any hawkish surprise could drain risk-asset appetite. Regulatory headlines also lurk: the Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to publish final guidance on crypto staking, and a restrictive ruling could sap retail momentum. Even so, the broader market mood leans optimistic, with several analysts setting year-end targets between $135,000 and $155,000—levels that imply a fresh wave of FOMO if $112,000 resistance breaks. Outlook For now, eyes remain on whether whales keep stepping in on minor dips and whether the 21-week average indeed acts as a floor. A clean bounce near $94,000 would fit the script of a classic mid-cycle correction inside a powerful bull trend. Conversely, a decisive close below that line could open the door to a deeper retracement toward the $80,000 handle. As ever in crypto, sentiment can flip quickly, but whale behavior continues to suggest the path of least resistance points higher—after a potential shakeout to test conviction.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/bitcoin-whales-ramp-up-accumulation-despite-pullback-risk/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

The raise was led by Saudi Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Abdulaziz Al Saud, investing $100 million, a spokesperson to the company told CoinDesk. The company sold 20 million ordinary shares priced at $6.05 per share. Adam Traidman, a former Ripple executive who led the SBI Ripple Asia, is joining the company as chairman of the board of advisors, according to the press release. Ripple is an enterprise-focused blockchain service provider closely related to the XRP Ledger . VivoPower shares surged as much as 26% on the news before giving back some of the gains. Recently, they were up over 11%, trading around $6.75. The move is the latest example of public firms raising money to purchase and add digital assets to their treasuries, a playbook popularized by Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) that has become the largest corporate holder of bitcoin BTC. While BTC has been the most sought-after asset among these firms, recent newcomers like DeFi Development and SharpLink Gaming directed their focus to Solana's SOL SOL and Ethereum's ether ETH, respectively. VivoPower, founded in 2014, aims to be the first publicly traded company with a crypto treasury strategy centered around XRP. It also plans to spin off its legacy business. \""After reviewing a number of listed vehicles seeking to embrace a digital asset treasury model, we selected VivoPower given its strategic focus on XRP and its objective to contribute to building out of the XRPL ecosystem,\"" Prince Abdulaziz said in a statement. \""We have been investors in the digital asset sector for a decade and have been long-term holders of XRP.\"" Read more: XRP Spot ETF in the U.S. Moves Closer to Reality",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/28/vivopower-raises-121m-to-launch-xrp-treasury-strategy-with-saudi-royal-backing,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|XRP","Markets|XRP|Ripple|Saudi Arabia|News",cryptocompare

2025-05-28T19:12:25.000Z,"Cynthia Lummis Says US Military Leaders Support Bitcoin Reserve","U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis has stated that American military generals are “big supporters” of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. The Wyoming lawmaker made the remarks earlier this week while addressing attendees at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Economic Power and Security According to Lummis, she has spoken to generals who understand that economic power is just as important as military power when dealing with aggressors around the world. She explained that this is why they strongly support the proposal. During her speech, the Republican politician also revealed that President Donald Trump is supportive of her Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act. The announcement follows the March 11 reintroduction of legislation by her and five other senators to add up to 1 million BTC to the U.S. Treasury over five years. Referring to the flagship cryptocurrency as “digital gold,” Lummis called for the U.S. to match its gold holding strategy for the proposal. “We have about 5% of the world’s gold in the United States in reserve. We need to have at least 5% of the world’s Bitcoin in reserve,” she said. The senator also connected the proposal to U.S. energy and industrial strategy. She credited China’s 2021 Bitcoin mining ban for shifting operations to North America and highlighted President Trump’s recent remarks urging the country to combine both. However, she believes that a national Bitcoin stockpile is the ultimate way of securing geopolitical advantage. State-Level and Global Initiatives The 70-year-old pointed to growing support for BTC reserves at the state level, claiming they have always been the “incubators of innovation,” with the United States leading through them. She emphasized that 30 American states are considering the initiative this year. Specifically, Lummis highlighted that Arizona, Texas, and New Hampshire have already advanced legislation in 2025 aimed at holding the cryptocurrency as a strategic asset. New Hampshire recently passed House Bill 302, allowing it to allocate 5% of funds in BTC for diversification. Arizona’s House Bill 2749 has also established a stockpile funded through unclaimed assets and staking rewards instead of direct state investment. Meanwhile, Texas is advancing Senate Bill 21, which proposes a state-managed BTC reserve stored in cold storage for security. Lummis also noted how the movement is happening globally. For example, the United Arab Emirates is getting exposure to Bitcoin through American spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Another initiative mentioned involves the Czech Republic, which is exploring how to include the digital asset in its diversified asset allocation through its central bank.

During his speech, Adams encouraged crypto businesses to return to the U.S. and set up shop in New York, echoing comments he made last week at the city's first-ever crypto summit held at Gracie Mansion, the mayor's official home in Manhattan. \""New York is the Empire State. We don't break empires. We build empires.

Let's get rid of the [Bit]License and allow us to have the free flow of bitcoin in our city.\"" Adams has previously criticized the BitLicense, the notoriously difficult-to-obtain license issued by New York's top financial regulator, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). However, when asked about the impact of the BitLicense and NYDFS's reputation as a tough regulator during a press conference earlier this month, Adams hedged, saying it was \""good to know the city is going to have safe regulations in place for those who are investing and there's not going to be any abuses, but at the same time, we can over regulate.\"" Adams also promised to fight for the creation of a so-called BitBond, probably referring to a municipal bond backed by bitcoin. Such a bond could potentially allow residents of New York to gain exposure to the top cryptocurrency in a tax-advantaged way. The instrument would also enable the city to raise capital. Adams did not provide details about the city's potential BitBond. However, the Bitcoin Policy Institute released a policy brief in March advocating for BitBonds that would use 90% of their proceeds to fund government and 10% to purchase bitcoin. Holders of the bond would receive 1% interest annually for 10 years. Upon maturity of the bond, they would also receive 100% of bitcoin's upside up to 4.5% compounded return, then 50% of all remaining upside.

The collaboration leverages Chintai’s institutional-grade asset origination and compliance infrastructure to set a new benchmark for Bitcoin-native finance. Through a white-label integration of Chintai’s technology, Arch Network will launch HoneyB: the first Bitcoin-native platform for tokenizing real-world assets Supercharging Institutional Assets With Bitcoin-Native Liquidity and Yield Bitcoin’s lack of programmability has left the leading cryptocurrency largely under-utilized, with less than 1% participation in the exploding decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Arch’s technology enables DeFi apps on the Bitcoin base layer without forcing users to bridge or wrap their assets on another chain. This empowers institutions and retail investors alike to tap Bitcoin’s deep liquidity and generate Bitcoin-native yield without compromising custody, trust, or chain integrity. The tokenization of traditional assets already gives institutions vastly improved distribution and liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets. By combining Arch Network’s ability to mobilize Bitcoin with Chintai’s fully compliant tokenization platform, the HoneyB offering creates a major paradigm shift in the RWA space. \""This partnership represents a significant advancement in Bitcoin-based finance,\"" said Josh Gordon, MD of Chintai. \""By bringing real-world assets to Bitcoin in a compliant manner, we're expanding the utility of the network while maintaining the integrity and security that makes Bitcoin trusted worldwide.\"" Crypto Maturity—Where Compliance Meets Opportunity As global regulation begins to catch up with technology, the confidence and participation of institutional finance in the digital assets space are accelerating. Real-world asset tokenization is expected to grow >50% annually over the next five years. Meeting market demand will require innovation and flexibility. HoneyB presents institutions and investors with a unique opportunity to leverage Bitcoin to purchase tokenized traditional assets and then use those assets to generate Bitcoin yield, all within an experience that has the accessibility of web2 and the secure decentralization of web3. \""This partnership bridges the gap between traditional and digital assets by providing secure access to Bitcoin liquidity and yield,\"" explains Matt Mudano, CEO at Arch Network. \""Investors can boost the productivity of their tokenized assets on Arch by deploying that capital across multiple Bitcoin-native DeFi strategies, including borrowing/lending, perpetual futures, and decentralized exchanges.\"" The Future of Digital Finance The partnership with Arch Network represents Chintai's latest step in broadening its platform capabilities, following the tokenization of multiple asset classes. It also reflects Chintai’s ongoing efforts to address market demand for adaptable real-world asset (RWA) solutions, enabling institutions to integrate Bitcoin within tokenized finance frameworks. About Chintai Nexus Chintai is a leading blockchain platform backed by prominent financial institutions, revolutionizing the integration of real-world assets into the digital economy. By leveraging blockchain's inherent security and transparency, Chintai empowers businesses and creators to tokenize RWAs, unlocking new opportunities for liquidity and global accessibility.

2025-05-28T18:42:26.000Z,"We asked an expert about quantum computer threat as Google and BlackRock ring the alarm","On May 27, it was reported that the investment management giant BlackRock warned investors that the Bitcoin network is vulnerable to quantum computers. Researchers from Google made a similar statement the same day. The CEO of decentralized post-quantum infrastructure, Naoris Protocol, David Carvalho, answered our questions to clarify the risks and whether there is hope. Speculations about the risk of the Bitcoin network being cracked by quantum computers in the near future are not something new. It is impossible to brute force RSA and ECC encryption used in Bitcoin with modern-day processors, but it is believed that quantum computers will be able to retrieve private keys if the public key is available. The date when quantum computers will achieve sufficient power to break Bitcoin wallets is referred to as Q Day. Let's add some nuance here. While quantum threats to cryptography are real, the timeline matters. Current quantum computers are nowhere near breaking Bitcoin's cryptography. The industry is already working on quantum-resistant solutions. — T (@agentic_t) May 27, 2025 Unlike regular processors, quantum processors can perform multiple calculations simultaneously, which dramatically increases computing speed. Several companies seek solutions to avoid the potential risks. Some wallet producers already claim their products are quantum-proof. Read more: Project 11 challenges everyone to crack the Bitcoin key using a quantum computer. The reward is 1 BTC BlackRock’s statement In the updated version of BlackRock’s prospectus for IBIT (BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF), the company warns investors about potential security risks associated with Bitcoin. BlackRock highlights the issue that developers of decentralized networks often lack a financial incentive to respond in a timely manner to security threats. One of the outlined threats is quantum computers, which, in a few years, will become powerful enough to crack the encryption used in Bitcoin. Below, you can see an extract pointing at the possibility of the security breach and the implication of such a breach on the price of IBIT (and understandingly, Bitcoin itself): “…a malicious actor may be able to compromise the security of the Bitcoin network or take the Trust’s bitcoin, which would adversely affect the value of the Shares. Moreover, the functionality of the Bitcoin network may be negatively affected such that it is no longer attractive to users, thereby dampening demand for bitcoin. Even if another digital asset other than bitcoin were affected by similar circumstances, any reduction in confidence in the source code or cryptography underlying digital assets generally could negatively affect the demand for digital assets and therefore adversely affect the value of the Shares.” The warning by BlackRock garnered attention, as the issue of quantum computers had never been publicly acknowledged at such a high level before. If such a large and respected company sees the problem in quantum computers, it is a signal that the threat is considerable. The Google study and a bit of irony A new study by Google suggests that the amount of resources needed to reach the Q Day is 20 times less than previously estimated. The author of the paper, Craig Gidney, writes: “In this paper, I reduced the expected number of qubits needed to break RSA2048 from 20 million to 1 million. My hope is that this provides a sign post for the current state of the art in quantum factoring, and informs how quickly quantum-safe cryptosystems should be deployed Vulnerable systems should be deprecated after 2030 and disallowed after 2035. Not because I expect sufficiently large quantum computers to exist by 2030, but because I prefer security to not be contingent on progress being slow.” Ironically, it is Google who works on advancing quantum computing. Its Sycamore processor has 53 physical qubits, which places it among the ten most powerful quantum computers currently existing. We discussed this topic with an expert To better understand what will happen when Q Day arrives and how much time is left, we addressed several questions to David Carvalho, founder and CEO of the decentralized post-quantum infrastructure, Naoris Protocol. Crypto.news: How much time do we have before the first Bitcoin wallet gets ‘hacked’ via a quantum computer? David Carvalho: A lot less time than people seem to think. There’s a whole lot of noise this week because a Google analyst has published a report saying it will take far less time than anticipated, but the cybersecurity community has known this for a while. Very soon – within five years or even less – we’ll get to a point where quantum computers have enough qubits and sufficient error correction to be a real threat to ECDSA encryption. We don’t know exactly when this will happen yet, but we do know that any protocol that doesn’t implement quantum security now won’t be able to retrofit it once quantum computers do catch up. So now is the time to focus all efforts on this before it’s too late. CN: What happens next after the quantum computer achieves the ability to hack BTC wallets? DC: The most frightening thing about quantum is that when we get to “Q-Day”, the attacks will be swift, quite possibly simultaneous, and certainly devastating. And most importantly, retroactive, meaning that even transactions that have been signed and executed could be at risk. Which means that wallets and blockchains can’t secure themselves against quantum attacks retroactively, they have to do it preemptively. CN: Will quantum computers be immediately available for bad actors? Are all the non-quantum-proof BTC wallets being hacked simultaneously? DC: Well, it’s unlikely there will be such a coordinated effort. Bad actors will likely target the biggest and most vulnerable wallets first and then move on to smaller targets. But that, in itself, is incredibly worrying, since the biggest targets are the likes of BlackRock, the second-largest holder of Bitcoin, which is also responsible for trillions of dollars in pension assets. It’s a real risk to financial stability. CN: What will be the fate of “lost bitcoins” and Satoshi Nakamoto’s holdings? DC: All of those “dormant” assets would be ripe for the picking, unless the blockchain is secured at the infrastructure level, because Satoshi will have almost certainly made transactions from vulnerable addresses. Given Satoshi’s substantial holdings, they would likely be a major target for bad actors. CN: In the event that non-quantum-proof BTC wallets are successfully hacked, will it be a good advertisement for quantum-proof wallets, or will it scare off the masses from Bitcoin and send the price down? DC: A quantum hack on Bitcoin would lead to a real loss of trust, so it wouldn’t be good news for the price. Like any black swan event, it could be the catalyst for a crypto winter. However, the fact that major institutions, and even governments, are now holding Bitcoin is encouraging. Because they are actually acutely aware of the risks from quantum computing – in fact, BlackRock recently highlighted it in its updated spot Bitcoin ETF filing. If anyone can push the blockchain sector to prepare for Q Day, it’s BlackRock and the US government. But they better do it quickly. Conclusion All in all, the fall of Bitcoin’s protection is only a matter of time, and time is running out, considering how many elements of the puzzle need to be switched to quantum-proof solutions – from mining infrastructure to exchanges and wallets. Transitioning to quantum-proof services may take time, so it’s better to start early.

2025-05-28T18:41:06.000Z,"U.S. Department of Labor Reverses 2022 Guidance That Blocked Digital Assets From 401(k) Plans","The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) is scrapping a mandate in its 2022 guidance that prevented digital assets from being included in 401(k) retirement plans. In a new press release, the DOL says it’s rolling back its 2022 compliance release, which previously instructed institutions to forgo using crypto assets as options for 401(k) plans. In 2022, the DOL warned fiduciaries to use “extreme care” before offering digital assets as options for retirement plans, language that was considered unusual at the time as the agency historically has taken a neutral approach toward the subject, according to the press release. According to U.S. Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer, the DOL is rolling back the government overreach created by the Biden Administration. Says Chavez-DeRemer, “The Biden administration’s department of labor made a choice to put their thumb on the scale. We’re rolling back this overreach and making it clear that investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not D.C. bureaucrats.” The DOL says it’s neither endorsing nor disapproving of employers who choose to include crypto assets and notes that its reasoning extends to other crypto-related products, such as derivatives. Previously, the DOL said it had “serious concerns” about people’s retirement funds being tied up in crypto due to “significant risks of fraud, theft, and loss.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Top Trader Shares Honest Opinion","Amid ongoing speculation in the crypto community, the idea that XRP could eventually reach $99 has resurfaced among some of its more optimistic supporters. However, professional traders remain skeptical. Tony “The Bull” Severino, a respected figure in the trading space, dismissed the target outright, stating there is no plausible possibility XRP could achieve that valuation under current conditions. Is XRP almost ready for its final thrust up? Monthly RSI is holding at a similar level as late 2017 pic.twitter.com/CR7T6KHrFK — Tony \""The Bull\"" Severino, CMT (@TonyTheBullCMT) May 26, 2025 As of this writing, XRP is trading at approximately $2.25. Reaching $99 would require an increase of more than 4,300%, pushing the asset’s market capitalization into territory currently held by Bitcoin. Severino emphasized that such a leap is highly improbable without an unprecedented global financial shift favouring XRP, which he regards as completely unrealistic. Technical Indicators Show Strength, But No Justification for $99 Technical indicators on XRP’s monthly chart reflect strong momentum, particularly with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at levels last recorded in 2017. However, this does not imply that exponential price growth is imminent. On the daily chart, a descending triangle pattern is visible, suggesting a period of consolidation. The price remains constrained by declining resistance, while the 100-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) act as support zones for buyers. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Analysts note that a breakout from this pattern could drive XRP back toward the $3 level . However, gains beyond that point are unlikely in the absence of a major fundamental catalyst. XRP’s current network data supports this cautious viewpoint. On-chain metrics and payment volumes indicate gradual, steady usage rather than explosive growth. Burn Rate Uptick Doesn’t Support Moonshot Projections XRP’s built-in burn mechanism, which permanently removes small amounts of tokens with every transaction, has seen a minor uptick in recent weeks. While this increase suggests higher network activity, it does not point to a level of demand capable of supporting a 50-fold price increase. In light of these observations, market experts advise caution. While short-term rallies are possible, projections above $3 to $4 should be approached conservatively unless the broader environment changes significantly. Severino’s response reflects this perspective, reinforcing the view that $99 is not a realistic target for the foreseeable future. Investors are encouraged to monitor potential breakouts, but should manage expectations and avoid being influenced by overly speculative forecasts.

This has brought Senator Tommy Tuberville’s bill to a success as he pushed to allow crypto investments in retirement funds. The department takes neutrality in crypto investments The 2022 guidance released by the agency tasked with protecting workers and retirees encouraged managers to “exercise extreme care” before adding crypto to their investment strategies. 401(k) plans generally restricted crypto investing, only offering indirect exposure via ETFs, mutual funds, or employer-approved options. Before the 2022 release, the Department had generally said it had no opinion on certain types of investments and strategies. Today’s release goes back to how the Department did things by not supporting or opposing plan managers who decided that adding crypto to a plan’s investment options is a good idea. Still, a plan manager’s choice about which type of investment to make should consider all the important facts and circumstances and will “necessarily be context-specific.” More importantly, the government’s stance is now fully neutral, meaning plan providers can offer crypto exposure. The Labor Department is the most recent government body to change its mind about limiting crypto activity since President Trump took office in January amidst others. In March, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reversed standards that require financial institutions to tell the agency before engaging in crypto-related activities. Later, the Federal Reserve took back its advice that banks shouldn’t get involved in crypto. The crypto market is stuck between a bull and a bear rally In the past 24 hours, the market capitalization has gone down 4.1% to $3.51 trillion, but that’s still higher than the recent highs of $3.49 trillion on Tuesday and almost at $3.54 trillion last Friday. Given how risk-averse the stock markets have been over the last few days, this is an interesting move. Bitcoin prices have been going up and down by 5% every day since May 22. They are now in the middle of that range at $111.7k. This area of highs is part of a circular extension pattern. It is 161.8% of the first upward motion from the beginning of April to the first days of May. Getting past 112k would then lead to 134k (261.8%). The SEC’s next meeting The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will hold a major “Emerging Trends in Asset Management” conference on June 5. The conference will focus on digital assets and tokenization. This move comes at a time when blockchain and token-based trading models are becoming more popular in the business world. At the event, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, known as “Crypto Mom,” will be joined by leaders from BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and Fidelity, among others. Because the SEC chose to include a session on digital assets shows that things are changing. It seems like regulators are not only keeping a close eye on the crypto market, but they are also now getting involved with it.

2025-05-28T18:24:02.000Z,"Bitcoin: This Investor Would Never Buy, But He Gave Golden Tips That Reinforce The Thesis","Summary I recommend buying Bitcoin due to accelerating adoption by states, institutions, and retail, with Arizona allocating up to 10% of reserves to BTC. Institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs are soaring, and Bitcoin now ranks as the 8th largest currency by market cap. Price models tied to global money supply and mining costs suggest Bitcoin could reach $125,000 by mid-year and $200,000 by 2026. Despite short-term risks from global austerity and increased short positions, Bitcoin's risk-return profile remains highly attractive versus other assets. Investment Thesis I recommend buying Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). The adoption of Bitcoin has accelerated across multiple fronts, such as the decision of the state of Arizona to allocate up to 10% of its reserves in Bitcoin. Among companies, Revolut (which has 50 million customers) announced the integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network, which will increase its use as a means of payment. Meanwhile, retail adoption is accelerating as there are more Bitcoin investors than gold in America. Bitcoin's market cap has already surpassed the Taiwan dollar, positioning it as the 8th largest currency by market cap, while investors wonder if it is already too expensive. According to some metrics, there is still a long way to go. Fast Adoption A major milestone in the institutionalization of Bitcoin has occurred recently. Arizona has approved its strategic Bitcoin reserve and will commit up to 10% of its $3.14 billion in assets to purchasing the cryptocurrency. The move could prompt other states to follow suit, and reinforces Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Adoption as a means of payment is also happening rapidly. Revolut, a European fintech with over 50 million customers, has announced that it will allow payments via the Bitcoin-based Lightning Network. As major players with large user bases adopt cryptocurrency as a means of payment, it becomes part of users' daily lives and gains strength as an alternative to the traditional payment system. This movement is also occurring among institutional investors. According to research, around 50 million Americans own Bitcoin, this number surpasses the 37 million gold investors. Bitcoin Is Becoming America's Reserve Asset (River) Investment Flow Soars The volume of investment in Bitcoin ETFs has skyrocketed in recent weeks and has already surpassed $900 million in a single week. This is a clear sign of institutional adoption in my view. BTC ETF Inflows (Zerohedge) Still talking about Bitcoin ETFs, the demand is so great that the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (NASDAQ: IBIT ) is among the top five ETFs in year-to-date inflows. The product has seen unimaginable adoption. Stand out from other assets After a recent price surge , Bitcoin has surpassed the market cap of Amazon, Alphabet and even silver. Bitcoin now has a market cap of over $2 trillion, reinforcing its structural relevance. Top Assets By Market Cap (companiesmarketcap) When compared to currencies, Bitcoin has surpassed the market value of the Taiwan dollar, and if it were considered a traditional currency, it would already be among the eight largest currencies in the world. Bitcoin surpassed Taiwan Dollar to Become the 8th Largest Currency in the World (ZeroHedge) Finally, respected investor Warren Buffett expressed his views on nations' fiscal policies. At his company's annual meeting, Buffett said he was concerned about governments' decisions to devalue their currencies. In this case, the concern of a major investor about the implications of fiscal irresponsibility by governments around the world is clear, and this is a major growth driver for Bitcoin, which corroborates the buy recommendation. Despite all the arguments listed above, many investors wonder whether they should still buy Bitcoin at these prices, and I will talk about price in the next chapter. Fair Price To reinforce the arguments above, we have the graph that compares the price of Bitcoin lagged by 10 weeks with the global money supply, which has been rising sharply driven by the US debt trajectory . We can see that the price of Bitcoin closely follows this global money supply, and based on the recent rally, the model suggests a target price for Bitcoin of $125,000 by the end of the first half of the year. Global M2 vs Bitcoin Lagged 10 weeks (Bonque) Another interesting metric is the price of Bitcoin and the average cost of mining. We can see that the price tends to stay above the cost of production, which makes this cost a \""floor\"". Let's see the chart below. BTC Price, Average Miner Breakeven Cost (Blockware) According to the chart, we could see the price of Bitcoin close to $200,000 by 2026, which supports my recommendation to buy Bitcoin. Although the outlook is very positive in my view, we need to understand the risks. Potential Threats To The Thesis Recently, Japanese authorities stated that they must adjust their debt as the cost is at extremely high levels. The reduction in Japanese bond issuance tends to improve the environment for trading bonds in other markets. This move by the Japanese government may be followed by other countries. If we have a global movement of austerity regarding its debt, we have a risk for the Bitcoin thesis. Finally, recent data shows that speculators have increased their shorts on bitcoin in recent weeks, likely expecting a price drop after hitting all-time highs. This could be a technical trigger for a short-term price drop. Speculators Increased Short Exposure in US Midcaps, Bitcoin (Bloomberg) The Bottom Line After a strong appreciation, many investors are wondering if there is room to buy Bitcoin, and as we saw in this article, I believe there is room for further increases. Institutional and retail investors have been rapidly adopting the cryptocurrency. When we analyze price projections, we have solid metrics such as price in relation to the global money supply or the cost of mining. Both point to Bitcoin exceeding $125,000 by the end of the year. Based on this analysis, I recommend buying Bitcoin. In my view, the risk-return ratio of the asset is still very attractive when we analyze it against other assets and currencies.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4790572-bitcointhis-investor-would-never-buy-but-he-gave-golden-tips-that-reinforce-the-thesis?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","BTC-USD",cryptocompare

2025-05-28T18:20:55.000Z,"Top Analyst Updates XRP Bull Flag, Sets 2-Digit Average Price Target","XRP continues to capture the attention of traders and analysts alike, with one of the most followed technical analysts in the crypto space, EGRAG Crypto, providing an updated and nuanced take on its bullish setup. In a recent post shared on X, EGRAG Crypto unveiled a refined interpretation of XRP’s bull flag formation, offering a set of price targets calculated using multiple analytical approaches. His insights shed light on how XRP’s long-term potential could unfold, especially as the asset navigates both technical patterns and the liquidity dynamics unique to the cryptocurrency market. Fine-Tuning the Bull Flag Formation According to EGRAG Crypto , the bull flag pattern currently forming on XRP’s chart has been slightly adjusted to more precisely align with the present bullish conditions. The bull flag is a classic technical pattern that often appears after a sharp upward move, followed by a period of sideways or slightly downward consolidation, which creates the “flag” portion. Once the asset breaks out of this consolidation, the measured move — or the distance the price is expected to travel post-breakout — can be estimated using several methods. #XRP – Bull Flag (Updated Version): Note : I’ve slightly adjusted the flag formation to perfectly match the current bullish setup and to estimate the measured move using different approaches. Logarithmic For long-term breakouts , I prefer using logarithmic charts ,… https://t.co/tf5SIoeekV pic.twitter.com/fhqweuOknf — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) May 28, 2025 EGRAG emphasizes the importance of using a logarithmic chart when analyzing crypto assets over the long term. Unlike linear charts, which show price movements in absolute terms, logarithmic charts account for percentage changes, making them particularly useful in markets like crypto, where exponential growth is common. For significant formations like XRP’s bull flag, the log approach can offer a more accurate reflection of breakout potential. Multiple Analytical Approaches In his updated breakdown, EGRAG applies three distinct methods to project XRP’s price target from the bull flag: the logarithmic (log) approach, the non-logarithmic (linear) approach, and an averaged estimate that balances the two. According to his findings, the logarithmic method points toward a breakout target of approximately $18 , while the linear (non-log) method produces a more conservative estimate of around $5.50. By averaging these two, EGRAG sets his preferred crypto target at $11.75, noting that this balanced figure accounts for liquidity variables unique to the cryptocurrency market, factors not as pronounced in traditional stock markets. Recognizing the unpredictable nature of crypto, EGRAG also applies a variability range of 15–20% to his targets. This means that, depending on liquidity conditions and market reactions, the average $11.75 target could extend upwards to around $13.51–$14.10 or, using the highest estimate, push the $18 projection up toward $20.70–$21.60. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Liquidity and Market Factors Matter EGRAG is careful to remind followers that crypto markets, compared to legacy financial markets, still operate with significantly smaller liquidity pools. This factor can amplify both gains and pullbacks, meaning price targets are not rigid markers but dynamic zones where variability is to be expected. While the measured moves provide a directional guide, real-world price action often stretches beyond or falls short of textbook targets, making flexibility and risk management crucial for traders. Currently, XRP’s price action is showing resilience, backed by bullish long-term formations and a community eager for the next big breakout . However, as always in crypto, the path to higher prices will not be a straight line. Corrections, volatility, and sudden market shifts can all emerge, particularly as broader market narratives evolve around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and macroeconomic forces. EGRAG Crypto’s updated analysis offers a detailed and thoughtful projection for XRP, framing the bull flag not just as a technical curiosity but as a potential roadmap for price evolution. With an average target of $11.75 , supported by both logarithmic and linear models, XRP holders and market watchers have a reference point as they navigate the coming months. As with all technical setups, success hinges not just on pattern recognition but also on the interplay of market sentiment, liquidity, and external catalysts. For now, though, XRP stands positioned within one of its most compelling bullish formations — and if EGRAG’s calculations prove accurate, a significant rally may well be on the horizon.

2025-05-28T18:18:41.000Z,"JD Vance Calls Crypto Market Structure Bill a ‘Priority’ for Trump Administration","LAS VEGAS, Nevada — Establishing a clear and pro-innovation regulatory framework for the crypto industry via a market structure bill is a priority for U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, Vice President J.D. Vance said Wednesday. Speaking to a massive crowd at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, Vance said that a regulatory framework is necessary to fully incorporate cryptocurrency into the mainstream U.S. economy, as well as to prevent future governments from rolling back the Trump administration’s crypto-friendly policies. “I hope that our party is in charge for a long time, but nothing is ever guaranteed in politics. So the best way to ensure that crypto is part of the mainstream economy is through a market structure bill that champions and doesn't restrict the extraordinary value that bitcoin and other digital assets represent,” Vance said at the event, which organizers said drew about 35,000 attendees. “We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to unleash innovation and use it to improve the lives of countless American citizens, but if we fail to create regulatory clarity now, we risk chasing this $3 trillion industry offshore in search of a friendlier jurisdiction, and President Trump is going to fight to fight to make sure that does not happen.” Vance said the Trump administration is hopeful that the GENIUS Act, the Senate’s stablecoin bill, will hit the president’s desk soon, allowing Congress to turn its attention to a market structure bill. He also said that the administration continues to work to “clean up the wreckage that the [Biden] administration left us,” including the so-called “regulation by enforcement” approach to crypto practiced by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under then-Chair Gary Gensler, and the widespread debanking of crypto companies, dubbed by the industry as Operation Chokepoint 2.0. “Operation Chokepoint 2.0 is dead and it’s not coming back under the Trump administration,” Vance said. “We reject the Biden administration's legacy of death by a thousand enforcement actions… We fired Gary Gensler, and we’re gonna fire everybody like him,\"" he added, though Gensler resigned the day Trump was sworn in Vance thanked the crypto industry, including Gemini’s Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss and Coinbase, for their early support of Trump’s campaign, attributing some of its success — as well as the successful elections of other crypto-friendly politicians like Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio) — to the crypto industry’s political support. “Take the momentum of your political involvement in 2024 and carry it forward into 2026 and beyond,” Vance said. In addition to urging the industry to stay involved in U.S. politics, Vance asked bitcoiners to stay abreast of developments in artificial intelligence (AI). “Remember that what happens in AI is very much going to affect, in good and bad ways, what happens to bitcoin and, of course, what happens to bitcoin is very much going to affect what happens in AI,” Vance said, adding: “Make sure you’re keeping tabs on and staying involved in what’s happening in artificial intelligence. I don’t want America to be negatively affected by what’s happening in AI, and the best way to ensure that smart people are at the AI conversation is to ensure that Bitcoin is part of the artificial intelligence conversation.”",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/05/28/jd-vance-calls-crypto-market-structure-bill-a-priority-for-trump-administration,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION","Policy|JD Vance|News",cryptocompare

2025-05-28T16:35:00.000Z,"Coinbase data breach 2025: What was stolen and what you need to know","Background of Coinbase’s May 2025 breach              Coinbase, America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, received an unsolicited email from an unknown threat actor on May 11, 2025. They claimed to possess sensitive information about its customers and demanded a ransom of $20 million. Before examining the breach, it is interesting to understand how it happened at a public company that spends millions monthly on cybersecurity. In February, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported increased thefts involving Coinbase users. He blamed aggressive risk models and pointed out Coinbase’s failure to prevent $300 million in yearly losses from social engineering scams. A table ZachXBT shared on X showed $65 million stolen from users between December 2024 and January 2025. He also said the real losses could be higher, as his data only came from his direct messages about onchain thefts, and excluded Coinbase support tickets and police reports he couldn’t access. The fear of cybercriminals stealing valuable information came true on May 11 when Coinbase published a blog post confirming that account balances, ID images, phone numbers, home addresses and partially hidden bank details were stolen during the data breach.On May 21, the same threat actor swapped about $42.5 million from Bitcoin (BTC) to Ether (ETH) via THORChain. They used Ethereum transaction input data to write “L bozo,” following it with a meme video of NBA player James Worthy smoking a cigar, seemingly mocking ZachXBT, who later flagged the message on his Telegram channel.                  What happened: Timeline of the Coinbase breach              The 2025 Coinbase breach wasn’t a typical crypto hack involving smart contracts or blockchain vulnerabilities. Instead, it was like a traditional IT security failure, marked by insider manipulation, corporate espionage and an extortion attempt.Below is a breakdown of how the incident unfolded:Insider recruitment and information theft began: To steal information from Coinbase, unknown cyber attackers began recruiting some overseas customer service agents (based in India) working for Coinbase. These insiders were paid to leak sensitive customer data and internal documentation, particularly that around customer service and account management systems. The stolen information was intended for future impersonation scams targeting users.Security detection and employee termination: Coinbase’s internal security team eventually detected suspicious activity linked to these employees. The involved staff were swiftly terminated, and the company alerted affected users. Though just 69,461 accounts were impacted, a fraction of Coinbase’s user base, the depth of stolen personal data made the breach significant.Extortion attempt via email (May 11, 2025): Coinbase received an unsolicited email claiming to possess internal system details and personally identifiable information (PII). This was later confirmed as credible in an 8-K SEC filing. Coinbase refuses to pay $20M ransom (May 14, 2025): Rather than accepting extortion, Coinbase flipped the script. The company reported the breach to law enforcement, disclosed it publicly and offered a $20 million reward for information leading to the attackers’ arrest, turning defense into offense. Breach disclosure and public notification: Shortly after the SEC filing, Coinbase publicly confirmed the breach, clarifying the scope and nature of the attack. A data breach notification was filed with the Maine Attorney General’s office, officially stating 69,461 users were affected. This timeline reflects how a crypto company responded differently to an attempted cyber-extortion, with transparency, resistance and bold countermeasures. This may bring in a change in the way companies respond to threats from cyber criminals.Did you know? North Korea’s Lazarus Group has stolen over $6 billion in crypto since 2017, including a record-breaking $1.46 billion from Bybit in 2025.                   What data was compromised in the Coinbase data breach in 2025?              According to a notification letter issued by Coinbase, attackers sought this information because they planned to launch social engineering attacks. The information they stole could help them appear credible to victims and possibly convince them to move their funds.Coinbase detailed the information the threat actors had got access to and what they could not. What attackers gotName, address, phone, and emailGovernment‑ID images (e.g., driver’s license, passport)Masked Social Security (last four digits only)Account data (balance snapshots and transaction history)Masked bank account numbers and some bank account identifiersLimited corporate data (including documents, training material, and communications available to support agents)What attackers couldn’t getLogin credentials or 2FA codesPrivate keysAccess to Coinbase Prime accountsAny ability to move or access customer fundsAccess to any Coinbase or Coinbase customer hot or cold walletsDid you know? In 2022, Crypto.com lost $30 million from 483 accounts. Initially, they claimed no funds were stolen, but later admitted the breach and refunded victims, highlighting the importance of transparency in crypto hacks.                  How Coinbase responded to the 2025 criminal data breach              In response to the 2025 data breach, Coinbase implemented a comprehensive strategy to mitigate damage, support affected users and strengthen its security infrastructure.Key actions taken by Coinbase included:Refusal to pay ransom: Coinbase declined the $20 million ransom demanded by the attackers. Instead, the company established a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.Customer reimbursements: The company committed to reimbursing customers who were deceived into sending funds due to the breach. Estimated costs for remediation and reimbursements range between $180 million and $400 million.Theft protection services: The company is providing all affected individuals with one year of complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services. This includes credit monitoring, a $1 million insurance reimbursement policy, identity restoration services, and dark web monitoring to detect if any personal information appears on illicit online platforms.Enhanced customer safeguards: Affected accounts will require additional ID verification for large withdrawals, including mandatory scam-awareness prompts to prevent further social engineering attacks.Strengthened support operations: Coinbase is opening a new support hub in the US. It has implemented stronger security controls and monitoring across all locations to prevent insider threats.Collaboration with law enforcement: The company is cooperating closely with US and international law enforcement agencies. Insiders involved in the breach were terminated and referred for criminal prosecution.Transparency and communication: Coinbase immediately notified affected customers once the breach was recognized. It is providing ongoing updates about the breach and the steps being taken to address it.These measures reflected Coinbase's commitment to customer protection and its proactive approach to cybersecurity challenges.Did you know? Crosschain bridges, like Nomad Bridge, lost $190 million in 2022 due to complex smart contract vulnerabilities. These bridges are hacker favorites because they store massive crypto assets, making them lucrative targets.                  How to stay safe in the event of Coinbase-like data breaches              In the wake of large-scale data breaches of crypto platforms, you should take proactive steps to protect yourself from social engineering attacks. Here is how you could stay safe in such an event:Never share sensitive information with impersonators: Scammers often pose as support staff or security agents after a breach. They may push you toward moving funds to crypto wallets they share with you or revealing sensitive information under various texts. Never share your password, two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, or recovery phrases with such impersonators. No crypto exchange will ask you to transfer crypto to a “new” or “safe” wallet. Turn on allow-listing of wallet addresses: Some exchanges provide this feature, which restricts withdrawals to pre-approved wallet addresses you fully control. This prevents unauthorized transfers even if your account is compromised. Enable strong 2FA: For 2FA, use a hardware security key or a trusted authentication app. Avoid relying on SMS-based 2FA, which is vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks. Be cautious with unsolicited communication: Hang up immediately if someone calls claiming to be from a crypto platform and asks for security credentials or requests asset transfers. Do not respond to unknown texts or emails with your personal information. Lock first, investigate later: If anything feels suspicious, lock your account immediately through the app or platform and report the incident to customer support via official channels. Stay informed: Regularly review security tips and updates from your crypto services to recognize and avoid evolving scam tactics.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/coinbase-data-breach-2025-what-was-stolen-and-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-28T15:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the industry’s most overlooked asset","Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin DepotA new proposal to install Bitcoin ATMs in federal buildings highlights an important question: Can crypto truly go mainstream without a stronger physical presence? For years, the industry has focused on software and decentralization, but its reluctance to invest in real-world infrastructure is starting to show. Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be.Everyone loves to talk about decentralization. There’s a good reason behind this. It defines the movement, shapes the technology, and supports the vision of a better financial system. While the industry focuses on code and algorithms, it lacks something basic. A decentralized system that exists only online is not genuinely decentralized.Physical infrastructure is the missing linkBitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the missing link. Without tools like ATMs, kiosks and access points at traditional retail locations, crypto remains out of reach for millions. Decentralization is not just about removing intermediaries. True decentralization requires expanding access. Without real-world touchpoints, even the most advanced network becomes limited to a closed circle of insiders.Recent: Arizona governor kills two crypto bills, cracks down on Bitcoin ATMsFor crypto to become mainstream, it must be easy to reach digitally and physically. That means showing up in places people already go and seamlessly integrating into people’s lives. Many groups in the American population still rely on cash or don’t have access to traditional banks. According to the latest Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation report, around 5.6 million American households don’t have a bank or savings account. Bitcoin ATMs give these users access without needing an app, a bank account or a crash course in blockchain. Most crypto tools today assume a level of financial fluency and infrastructure that millions simply do not have. The result is a digital-only ecosystem that locks out newcomers and widens the divide between early adopters and everyone else.User-friendly screen in the right placePhysical infrastructure helps address this issue. A Bitcoin ATM in a grocery store or gas station is not just a convenience but a bridge to financial inclusion. It is an invitation to someone who has never bought crypto, telling them they can participate. No bank, no broker, just a user-friendly screen in a familiar place.These machines also generate new economic activity. Local businesses benefit from increased foot traffic as the kiosks create passive revenue. For many communities, they provide access to a parallel financial system that was previously out of reach. This is a tangible example of crypto’s real-world utility. It is already happening, and it is measurable.The crypto industry’s blind spotThe industry often treats physical infrastructure like an afterthought. The obsession with building new digital solutions has created a blind spot. Innovation without usability builds systems that serve the few but exclude the many. If someone can buy Bitcoin (BTC) at the same place they buy their morning coffee, that is when crypto stops feeling like an obscure digital asset and starts becoming part of everyday life.As governments increase regulation, trusted and transparent interfaces will become more important. When operated within regulatory frameworks, Bitcoin ATMs offer a way to provide access between traditional finance and digital assets. They are familiar, easy to monitor and offer a more approachable entry point for the general public.Like any financial tool, Bitcoin ATMs have drawn scrutiny, particularly in cases where bad actors use them. Rather than dismissing the machines themselves, we should focus on investing in better oversight, stronger consumer education and smarter regulation. The overwhelming majority of people who use Bitcoin ATMs do so for legitimate reasons: to send remittances, to move money securely or to access digital assets without traditional banking barriers. Building trust does not mean avoiding or dismantling physical access, but improving it.The first time someone uses Bitcoin should not involve reading a white paper or navigating a tutorial. It should be as familiar as using an ATM or tapping a payment terminal. This is not an argument against innovation. Software and protocols will continue to evolve and play an important role. Physical infrastructure provides something those tools cannot: trust through presence. When people can see and use crypto in their neighborhood, at a store they already visit or in a format they already understand, it changes how they think about crypto and who it is for. According to Coin ATM Radar, there are over 30,000 Bitcoin ATMs in the US. It’s a meaningful start, but still only a small step toward widespread access. Crypto’s long-term success will depend not just on innovation but also on inclusion. That means building more than networks; it means building presence. When people can interact with crypto in the physical world, it stops being abstract and becomes usable. That is how digital finance becomes everyday finance.Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin Depot.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-28T15:00:00.000Z,"Polygon-backed, high-yield blockchain launches for institutional adoption","The Katana Foundation, a nonprofit focused on decentralized finance (DeFi) development, is launching its private mainnet, aiming to unlock greater crypto asset productivity via deeper liquidity and higher yields for users.The Katana Foundation launched a DeFi-optimized, private blockchain, Katana, on May 28, incubated by GSR Markets and Polygon Labs, with the public mainnet launch set for June.The new blockchain will enable users to earn higher yields and explore DeFi in a “unique, optimized yield environment” that unlocks latent value through an ecosystem that makes every digital asset “work harder,” according to an announcement shared with Cointelegraph.“DeFi users deserve ecosystems that prioritize sustainable liquidity and consistent ‘real’ yields,” wrote Marc Boiron, the CEO of Polygon Labs and core contributor at Katana, adding: “Katana’s user-centric model turns inefficiencies into advantages, establishing a truly positive-sum environment for builders and participants alike.\""Source: KatanaKatana aims to solve the crypto industry’s liquidity fragmentation issue, which can cause significant price slippage, as one of the main barriers limiting institutional DeFi participationRelated: Here’s how abstraction minimizes fragmentation in DeFi, making it more fluidTo reduce the value slippage in DeFi, Katana’s blockchain concentrates the liquidity from numerous protocols and collects yields on all potential sources to create an ecosystem with deeper liquidity and more predictable lending and borrowing rates.2025 Institutional Investor Digital Assets Survey. Source: EY-ParthenonInstitutional participation in DeFi is set to triple over the next two years to 75% from 24% of 350 surveyed institutional investors, according to management consulting firm EY-Parthenon.To tackle the growing institutional liquidity needs, Katana’s liquidity pool is composed of multiple protocols, including lending protocol Morpho, decentralized exchange (DEX) Sushi and perpetual DEX Vertex, enabling users to trade “blue-chip assets” without needing crosschain transfers.Katana has also incorporated Conduit’s sequences and Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network.Related: Polygon CEO: DeFi must ditch hype for sustainable liquidityKatana to compound DeFi yield from “Ethereum-based opportunities”Katana aims to boost sustainable yield by building a cohesive DeFi ecosystem. For instance, VaultBridge deploys bridged assets into overcollateralized, curated lending strategies on Ethereum via Mopho to earn yield, which is routed back and compounded on Katana.The protocol will reinvest network fees and a portion of application revenue back into its ecosystem.“This reduces reliance on short-term incentives, generates consistent yield, and as it grows, acts as an increasingly stable backstop during periods of volatility and liquidity shocks,” Polygon Labs’ Boiron told Cointelegraph, adding:“Yield is distributed pro-rata to each chain using VaultBridge protocol based on their share of total deposits into VaultBridge.”“So if Katana supplies 20% of the total vault deposits, it receives 20% of the yield back,” he added.Katana will subsequently allocate its share of yield to users through boosted DeFi incentives across “core apps” such as Sushi, Morpho or Vertex. The yield is generated from “Ethereum-based opportunities and then enhanced through Katana’s core applications,” said Boiron.Polygon Labs’ CEO previously criticized DeFi protocols for fueling a cycle of “mercenary capital” by offering sky-high annual percentage yields (APYs) through token emissions. Beyond infrastructure-related limitations, regulatory uncertainty remains another significant barrier to institutional DeFi adoption.2025 Institutional Investor Digital Assets Survey.

2025-05-28T14:15:00.000Z,"Elderly crypto investors are getting scammed: Teach them these key safety tips","Why are seniors being targeted in crypto scams?              Scammers prey on seniors because they view them as financially secure, trusting and less familiar with rapidly evolving technology.Let’s understand why seniors are key targets.Perception of wealth: Many older adults have retirement savings or pensions, making them lucrative targets.Lower tech fluency: Navigating crypto wallets, private keys and blockchain concepts can be intimidating, something scammers exploit.Embarrassment prevents reporting: Victims often feel ashamed, making them less likely to report the crime.Crypto is irreversible: Once funds are sent via Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, there’s no reversing the transaction. That’s a dream scenario for scammers.According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), seniors report growing losses linked to cryptocurrency investment fraud, romance scams and government impersonation. In South Carolina’s Beaufort County alone, seniors reported over $3.1 million in crypto scam losses in 2024.And these scams are becoming more sophisticated. AI tools can now clone voices, spoof caller IDs and create fake websites that mimic legitimate exchanges or financial institutions to steal from unsuspecting seniors.                  Examples of crypto scams targeting older adults              From crypto romance fraud in Cambodia targeting British pensioners to ATM scams in Minnesota and impersonation schemes across the US, scammers have stolen millions by preying on older adults’ trust and unfamiliarity with digital assets.1. Cambodian scam compounds exploiting British pensionersIn Bavet, Cambodia, scam compounds operated by networks linked to the Chinese mafia have been uncovered. These operations enslave trafficked workers, forcing them to participate in romance and cryptocurrency fraud. British pensioners have been prime targets, suffering significant losses.. One victim from the West Midlands lost over 250,000 British pounds ($340,000). These scams often employ “pig-butchering” tactics, cultivating trust online before executing large-scale financial fraud.2. Crypto ATM scams in MinnesotaIn Minnesota, over 5,500 incidents involving cryptocurrency kiosks led to losses exceeding $189 million in 2023. Seniors were the most vulnerable victims, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the stolen funds. Scammers often direct victims to transfer funds using QR codes tied to fraudulent accounts. Cities like Stillwater have implemented bans on crypto ATMs to protect residents.3. Romance scam targeting a disabled woman in the UKLisa Nock, a 44-year-old woman from Staffordshire with autism and mobility issues, fell victim to a romance scam after being targeted on Instagram by someone impersonating Australian TV vet Dr. Chris Brown. Over 18 months, the scammer manipulated her into transferring £11,000 in cryptocurrency, claiming the funds were for flights, visas and hiring a substitute vet. Lisa eventually realized the deceit and reported the fraud to authorities.4. Government or bank impersonators demanding crypto paymentsScammers may impersonate the IRS, Social Security Administration, Medicare or local law enforcement. Their script is simple: You’re in legal trouble or owe back taxes, and the only way to avoid arrest or penalties is to pay in Bitcoin.This tactic has been used across the US. In South Carolina, a retired healthcare worker named Marianne was told she missed jury duty and owed $7,500. Following fake sheriff’s instructions, she fed the cash into a Coinstar crypto ATM, which instantly converted her money to Bitcoin and sent it straight to scammers.5. Ohio woman loses life savings in cryptocurrency investment scam An Ohio woman lost her life savings in a cryptocurrency investment scam that defrauded victims of about $4.9 million. The scheme involved 33 identified victims nationwide, with five more accounts under FBI investigation.Did you know? A $243 million Bitcoin heist involving a fake Google call spiraled into a real-world kidnapping plot straight out of a Netflix thriller.                  7 Key safety tips every elderly crypto investor should know              Elderly investors should follow key safety steps like never sending crypto to strangers, verifying suspicious contacts, enabling two-factor authentication, avoiding public WiFi and discussing large transactions with trusted family before acting.Here are the key safety tips every elderly crypto investor should be aware of:Never send crypto to strangers: If someone you’ve never met in person asks for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies,  it’s almost certainly a scam. This includes social media, messages on Facebook, emails from supposed tech support or even someone you’ve been chatting with on a dating site. No legitimate person or organization will randomly ask for crypto. If you’re being told, “Send me $500 and I’ll send back $1,000,” you’re being conned. Always assume unsolicited crypto requests are fraudulent.Double-check all contacts: If you get a call, email, or text from a bank, the IRS or even a family member in crisis, don’t respond immediately. Call the official number on your bank card or government website to verify.Use trusted wallets and exchanges only: Stick to platforms with strong security and regulation like Coinbase, Kraken and Binance.US. Avoid apps from unknown websites or links in emails.Watch for pressure tactics: Scammers thrive on urgency; you only have two hours to pay; act now to claim your prize. Real financial institutions do not use this kind of pressure.Set up two-factor authentication (2FA): All crypto wallets and exchange accounts should have 2FA enabled. This adds a second layer of protection even if a password is stolen.Avoid public WiFi for crypto transactions: Never send crypto or log in to financial apps over public WiFi at coffee shops, airports or hotels. These networks are often unsecured and can be intercepted by hackers. Use your home WiFi or mobile data instead, and ensure your device has up-to-date antivirus protection.Talk to family before big transactions: Before sending large amounts of crypto or any money, have a quick conversation with someone you trust. Scammers often isolate victims and make them feel they must act alone. Encourage seniors to adopt a simple rule: If it’s more than $100, talk to someone first. A five-minute phone call could prevent a five-figure mistake.                  Think grandma got scammed? Here’s what to do immediately              If you’ve been scammed, act fast: Report it to the crypto exchange (they might freeze the funds), file a fraud report with the FTC or Chainabuse and contact elder support services for guidance and protection.1. Report the scam to the exchangeIf the funds were sent through Coinbase, Binance or another exchange, contact them right away. Some may be able to freeze accounts if action is taken quickly.2. File a report with law enforcement and the FTCCall your local police department.Report fraud to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.You can also report crypto fraud at Chainabuse.com, a trusted crypto crime reporting platform.3. Contact elder support resourcesElderCare Locator (USA): Connects older adults and families to local services, including Adult Protective Services for financial exploitation cases.Action Fraud (UK): The UK’s national fraud reporting center for scams, including those involving crypto.Scamwatch, ACCC (Australia): Provides scam alerts and allows reporting of cryptocurrency and financial scams affecting seniors.Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (Canada): A national agency for reporting and tracking fraud, including crypto scams targeting older adults.National Council on Aging – NCOA (US): Offers educational resources and scam prevention tools for seniors and caregivers.Age UK (UK): Provides advice and support for older people facing financial abuse, including online and crypto scams.Did you know? Hackers have been caught selling counterfeit smartphones infected with the Triada Trojan, malware that steals crypto and sensitive data by deeply embedding itself in the device’s system.                  Is crypto safe for seniors?              Yes, but only with proper education and safeguards. Cryptocurrency can be empowering, offering independence and investment opportunities. However, seniors can become easy targets without a strong awareness of the risks.Scammers increasingly target seniors through sophisticated tactics like fake investment platforms, romance scams and impersonation of government or tech support personnel. These schemes often involve urgent demands, emotional manipulation or unfamiliar technologies like crypto ATMs.To minimize risk, seniors should be educated on the basics of cryptocurrency, recognize common fraud tactics, use reputable platforms and involve trusted family or advisers before making transactions. Awareness and vigilance are essential to protect both assets and peace of mind in the digital age.As crypto continues to go mainstream, scammers are adapting fast. Don’t let your loved ones get rug-pulled or emotionally manipulated into losing everything. Share these tips. Stay involved. And when in doubt, always verify before sending funds.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/elderly-crypto-investors-are-getting-scammed-teach-them-these-key-safety-tips?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

He added that he is confident many of those investors will cycle back into the crypto market to fuel the next big rally.2. Smart money agrees on Bitcoin’s year-end targetSeveral analysts have set $200,000 as their target for Bitcoin in 2025. Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets at Standard Chartered, has been one of the leading voices.Kendrick said in an email note seen by Cointelegraph that Bitcoin is expected to hit $120,000 in the first half of 2025 en route to $200,000 by year-end, fueled by the rise of stablecoins.Related: A Bitcoiner’s guide to South Africa’s Garden Route“The US Senate… voted 66-32 to advance the GENIUS Act,” Kendrick wrote in the email note. “The point of the stablecoin Act is that stablecoins will further legitimise the whole asset class.

David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA, said the agency aims to support innovation while ensuring market trust:“At the FCA, we have long supported innovation that benefits consumers and markets.

It marks the first monthly sales increase since the start of the year, suggesting renewed interest in digital collectibles. This follows a five-month decline in sales since volume peaked at over $900 million in December 2024. May also had the highest number of transactions in 2025, reaching 5.5 million, according to CryptoSlam. The sales uptick could also be attributed to the divergence between unique NFT buyers and unique NFT sellers.

In May, NFT sellers fell to around 284,600, the lowest amount recorded on the CryptoSlam platform since April 2021. The divergence between the growing buyer interest and shrinking seller activity could set the stage for more competitive bidding, which may lead to higher valuations. Chart compiled by Cointelegraph to demonstrate CryptoSlam data on NFT buyers and sellers.

These include AnchorZero, a platform helping crypto founders use Roth IRAs for tax advantages, and Spark Capital, a new venture focused on stablecoin infrastructure.Other portfolio companies include Ethena, ClearToken, Crossover Markets, Station70 and Theo — an onchain trading infrastructure project that recently raised $20 million from 17 different VC firms.The company plans to eventually back up to 30 companies with early-stage rounds ranging from $500,000 to $1 million.Metalayer was co-founded by Chainlink Labs’ former head of growth, Mickey Graham, and former Two Sigma executives Andy Kangpan and David Winton.Winton developed a proprietary data platform called Moirai to help Metalayer analyze developer activity, protocol engagement and blockchain transaction patterns to uncover promising projects. “Moirai is our internal sourcing engine for identifying early-stage crypto startups,” Graham told Cointelegraph in a written statement. “The platform is designed to help us systematically surface high-quality startups, and it evaluates opportunities across several key dimensions,” he said.Related: VC Roundup: 8-figure funding deals suggest crypto bull market far from overCrypto VC deals on the rise, but there’s a catchCrypto venture capital activity saw a notable uptick in the first quarter, with increases in both total funding and deal volume, according to data from Galaxy Digital. VC funding reached $4.9 billion during the quarter, though nearly half came from a single deal — Binance, which raised $2 billion from MGX, an investment firm backed by a United Arab Emirates sovereign wealth fund.Despite the outsized impact of the Binance deal, overall market activity showed signs of improving. A total of 446 crypto funding deals were recorded in Q1, marking a 7% increase from the previous quarter.Crypto VC deals remain considerably lower than the peak of the previous bull market. Source: GalaxyNevertheless, venture capital investors remain cautious about making fresh commitments to the sector, according to Robert Lee, a senior analyst at PitchBook. The first quarter was a challenging market environment as a sharp correction in crypto prices compounded investor reluctance.In an interview with Bloomberg last month, Lee noted that many venture capital firms are still on the sidelines. “[M]any of the funds from the last cycle have yet to deliver meaningful DPI,” he said, referring to the private equity metric Distributed to Paid-In Capital, which measures how much capital has been returned to investors relative to what they invested.Metalayer’s Mickey Graham believes that at least some of this drop-off is due to a much-needed transition happening beneath the surface:“We believe the crypto industry has crossed the chasm from an early market defined by infrastructure-building to a mainstream technology sector characterized by the deployment of blockchain technology throughout the global economy.”Although VC activity remains subdued compared to past bull cycles, Kadan Stadelmann, the chief technology officer of the Komodo Platform, told Cointelegraph that the industry has seen an “uptick in mergers and acquisitions, suggesting market maturation.”Stadelmann indicated that pro-crypto regulations in the United States and European Union, “have given large institutions confidence to continue making investments into crypto firms.”At a geographic level, the US accounted for more than a third of total crypto VC deals in 2024 — a trend expected to continue this year.

In his widely cited 2022 paper, “The Ineluctable Modality of Securities Law: Why Fungible Crypto Assets Are Not Securities,” he wrote:“[T]here is no current basis in the law relating to ‘investment contracts’ to classify most fungible crypto assets as ‘securities’ when transferred in secondary transactions.”In his paper, Cohen explained that in secondary transactions, an investment contract transaction is generally not present. He further claimed that fungible cryptocurrencies “neither create nor represent the necessary cognizable legal relationship between” a legal entity and the holder that is the “hallmark of a security.”Related: Banking groups ask SEC to drop cybersecurity incident disclosure ruleSEC’s “new paradigm”Ripple also referenced SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce's May 19 “new paradigm” speech. She said she’d been voicing her dissent with the regulator’s approach to crypto, adding:“Having emerged from the crypto dissent years, I am glad to be able speak to you today as the head of the Commission’s Crypto Task Force about a rational and coherent path forward and a new paradigm at the SEC.”Peirce said that the SEC’s “approach to crypto in recent years has evaded sound regulatory practice and must be corrected.” She also said that most cryptocurrencies are not securities, adding:“Most currently existing crypto assets in the market are not [securities]. My supplemental answer is that economic realities matter and non-security crypto assets may be distributed as part of an investment contract, which is a type of security.”Ripple’s long fight with the SECThe SEC had viewed a large portion of digital assets as securities, with the regulator’s former chair, Gary Gensler, stating in 2023 that most of the crypto market falls under the securities bracket. This stance led to a protracted legal battle between the SEC and Ripple.The lawsuit first began at the end of 2020, when the SEC took action against Ripple and its executives, claiming that XRP sales constituted unregistered security offerings. Still, after the government’s stance on crypto changed with the election of current US President Donald Trump, Ripple has mostly won the battle, with the SEC recently dropping its appeal against a ruling favorable to the company.In its recent letter to the SEC, Ripple also cited a ruling in the case noting that “the court held that certain of Ripple’s historical institutional sales of XRP were investment contracts,” while the secondary sales were not. Furthermore, the judge “determined that XRP itself is not a security.”Magazine: XRP win leaves Ripple and industry with no crypto legal precedent set",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-sec-letter-crypto-not-securities?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Five commissioners are supposed to make up the CFTC, and no more than three can be from the same political party.Goldsmith Romero said that during her tenure, all the commissioners had different perspectives and experiences that, when brought together, were “really helpful.”“So what happens if the CFTC gets down to one and gets new authority for crypto? It’s going to be really, really hard; you’re not going to have the same push and pull,” she said.The Trump administration has floated the idea of handing the reins of crypto regulation to the CFTC in the past.

2025-05-28T02:11:48.000Z,"Real-world assets could revitalize dying NFT lending market: DappRadar","Real-world assets linking up with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is one of a few key catalysts that could reignite the waning NFT lending sector, which is suffering from a collapse in volumes and user activity, says blockchain analytics platform DappRadar.Volumes in the NFT lending market, which allows NFT holders to take out a loan against their token, have dropped 97% from a peak of around $1 billion in January 2024 to $50 million in May, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a May 27 report.Gherghelas said for NFT lending to “move beyond survival mode,” it needs “new catalysts” to reignite the sector, such as real-world asset NFTs, like tokenized real estate or yield-bearing assets that could unlock more stable, trusted collateral sources.“So far, 2025 has not delivered a compelling reason for NFT lending to bounce back,” she said. “While the infrastructure is still here and the platforms remain active, activity has slowed across the board.” Borrower and leading activity have taken a big hit in the NFT lending sector. Source: DappRadar“For now, the sector seems to be in a holding pattern, waiting either for market recovery or a new use case to reignite interest.”Gherghelas added that other catalysts that could rekindle NFT lending were tools that make it easier for NFT holders to borrow against their tokens, and that protocols should create “smart infrastructure” such as undercollateralized loans, credit scores and artificial intelligence risk matching.The report adds that since January last year, borrower activity has declined by 90% and those willing to lend have shrunk by 78%.The average NFT loan size has also taken a hit from a peak of $22,000 in 2022 to $4,000 in May, a 71% year-over-year drop.Gherghelas said this shift “shows that either users are borrowing against lower-value assets or simply becoming more conservative with leverage.”NFT lending overall trading volume and market activity have dropped off from the all-time highs of past years. Source: DappRadarThe average loan duration is also lower; after hitting an average of roughly 40 days in 2023, it’s been down to 31 days and has held steady throughout 2024 and into 2025.Gherghelas said this could indicate that “loans are being taken more frequently but for shorter periods, perhaps a sign of more tactical liquidity plays.”NFT ﻿market downturn also hurts lendingPart of the slowdown in NFT lending is connected to the overall NFT market decline, which has seen volumes drop 61% in the first quarter to $1.5 billion compared to $4.1 billion a year ago.“With collateral value collapsing, the lending activity naturally followed,” Gherghelas said. “There are a few exceptions that managed to hold or regain traction, but they’ve been outliers, not enough to lift the sector.”Related: AI decentralized apps are coming for the Web3 throne: DappRadarThe protocol landscape has also narrowed, and the number of active NFT lending apps is limited, with only eight protocols holding any meaningful share.“The flip-for-liquidity model that worked during bull markets isn’t built for a quieter, more risk-averse environment. But that doesn’t mean NFT lending is finished; it’s simply shifting focus,” Gherghelas said.“Platforms are diversifying, use cases are shifting, and collateral preferences are changing. If the next wave builds on utility, culture, and better design, NFT lending might just find its second wind — one built to last.”Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-world-assets-revitalize-dying-nft-lending-dappradar?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

SharpLink will invest $425 million to acquire 120,000 ETH. Ethereum futures open interest hits an all-time high of $36.1 billion, with ETH price climbing 4.5% on the daily chart. Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming (SBET) announced a $425 million private investment in public equity (PIPE), acquiring approximately 69.1 million shares at $6.15 each to establish the first Nasdaq-listed Ethereum (ETH) treasury company.Spearheaded by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, this move mirrors Strategy’s (MSTR) successful Bitcoin treasury strategy, which has yielded over $8.2 billion in gains in 2025, by leveraging stock and bond sales to acquire BTC.Former Ethereum core developer and contributor Eric Conner highlighted the bullish implications of SharpLink’s move, noting its potential to create a “public ETH proxy for funds that can’t hold tokens directly.” Conner emphasized that the acquisition of 120,000 ETH—likely to be staked—could lead to “supply compression” by removing tokens from circulation. The Ether proponent also pointed to the “new narrative fuel” this provides, positioning ETH as a “digital reserve collateral” and potentially driving its adoption on mainstream balance sheets through an equity wrapper like $SBET.However, crypto analyst VICTOR cautioned against over-enthusiasm, outlining the risk of leveraging gains from an altcoin still down 19% in 2025. In Q1 2025, Cointelegraph reported a sharp decline in Ethereum network fees, dropping to $605,000 from $2.5 million in just two weeks in March, alongside a noticeable decrease in decentralized app (DApp) activity.

The majority of these rallies—eight out of ten—resulted in negative returns, while one rally triggered a short squeeze, driving prices higher, and another displayed neutral price action.From a technical perspective, Ether’s price action on the daily chart posted a descending triangle, a bullish breakout pattern, which creates equal highs and higher lows, converging toward an imminent rally. The pattern is bordered by two trendlines, the upper resistance, currently around $2,700 and the ascending support line. A bullish breakout above $2,677 targets the pattern’s measured move, calculated by adding the triangle’s height to the breakout point.

Speaking at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, Sigel said the most viable path forward may involve inserting Bitcoin mining incentives into the congressional budget reconciliation process.According to Sigel, the most effective path to growing a US strategic Bitcoin reserve would be through targeted amendments to congressional budget legislation. These could include tax credits for mining companies that use methane gas and other incentives aimed at encouraging miners to share a portion of their mined BTC with the federal government. He argued that such an approach would allow the reserve to grow organically over time. Sigel also highlighted the limitations of executive actions in achieving this goal:\""The problem with executive action is that it's going to prompt lawsuits. And anything over $100 million is going to get sued by the Elizabeth Warrens of the world. So, I would say start with something maybe in the Exchange Stabilization Fund for $100 million.\""US President Donald Trump established the US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve through a March 7 executive order.

FalconX, a digital asset broker, said it secured a facility worth over $100 million as part of a “broader credit framework,” while Maple Finance reportedly closed the first tranche of an agreement with Cantor.The service allows companies holding Bitcoin to borrow funds and use the cryptocurrency as collateral, providing a way to unlock liquidity without selling their BTC holdings. Cantor announced its Bitcoin financing business with an initial capital of $2 billion in July 2024, targeting institutional investors seeking to leverage their Bitcoin. At the time, the company said Anchorage Digital and Copper would serve as custodians and collateral managers in the venture.Credit markets are a fundamental part of the financial system, allowing capital to flow between borrowers and lenders and supporting economic activity across sectors. Their central role also means they can contribute to financial distress when risks are mismanaged. While mirroring some functions of traditional finance, crypto credit markets have been operating with less regulatory oversight.Digital asset crisis of 2022 This dynamic was evident during the 2022 crisis in the digital asset sector. Celsius Network, once a leading crypto lending platform, collapsed after engaging in risky financial practices and facing allegations of fraud. Similarly, BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2022 following significant exposure to the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.  According to a report from Galaxy, the total crypto lending market, including crypto-backed collateralized debt positions (CDPs) tied to stablecoins, stood at $36.5 billion in the last quarter of 2024, marking a 43% decline from its all-time high of $64.4 billion in 2021. Despite the broader contraction, onchain lending platforms have seen a dramatic rebound, with open borrowed positions surging to $19.1 billion by Q4 2024, a 959% increase over two years.

However, in this context, it also suggests potential liquidity injections from the Fed, given the unfavorable US fiscal outlook, where government spending exceeds revenue capacity.US President Donald Trump has called for lower interest rates, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell remains cautious due to a strong labor market and rising inflation pressures, whether driven by tariffs or easy credit conditions.

Still, it would be inaccurate to suggest Bitcoin has decoupled from traditional markets; its 30-day correlation with the S&P 500 has remained above 70% over the past four weeks.
