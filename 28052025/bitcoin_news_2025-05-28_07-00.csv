2025-05-28T04:48:45.000Z,"Bitcoin Has Hit Its ATH, Crypto Whales Accumulate 3 Other Altcoins Set For Same Trajectory","Bitcoin’s fresh all-time high has reignited risk appetite across the crypto market. As the flagship asset consolidates above six figures, deep-pocketed investors are recycling profits into three altcoins they believe could follow a similar trajectory: Dogecoin (DOGE), Ethereum (ETH) and presale newcomer Yeti Ouro (YETIO). YETIO’s $100,000 giveaway is drawing investors into its presale, further increasing demand. Bitcoin’s Record Close Sets the Tone After a turbulent week, Bitcoin bounced to $110,247 and is holding ground after briefly tapping $112k earlier in the session . Market coverage credits the rebound to President Trump’s decision to pause EU tariffs and Strategy’s latest 4,000-BTC purchase , which tightened circulating supply. Glassnode’s accumulation score has returned to January’s bull-phase reading, signalling that wallets of every size are net buyers rather than sellers. With liquidity firm and upside optionality for June contracts pricing targets past $120k, Bitcoin is acting as the springboard for the wider rally. Dogecoin: Meme Liquidity with Whale Muscle Dogecoin’s latest push is being scripted by on-chain giants, not just social buzz. Experts note that more than 1 billion DOGE moved into whale addresses over the past month, including two withdrawals totalling 260 million coins on 20 May. The surge broke resistance, lifting the price to $0.2306 and converting the $0.22 zone into fresh support. Technical analysts point to a textbook bull-flag continuation—historically a precursor to triple-digit percentage moves for the meme coin . If volume stays elevated, Dogecoin could test the psychological $0.30 handle before Bitcoin’s next leg up. Ethereum: Smart-contract King Attracts Quiet Giants Ethereum continues to pull in institutional-grade money. An update released today shows top-tier wallets holding a larger share of supply than at any time since 2023, confirming sustained accumulation. Exchange outflows and record-high staking deposits support the view that large holders are locking coins away for yield rather than trading them. Price action reflects the on-chain story: ETH reclaimed $2.6k and now trades at $2,662.13 , up nearly 4% in 24 hours. If whales flip the $2,700–$2,800 band into support, analysts see a quick run toward $3,000, setting up the possibility of an all-time-high challenge later this year. YETIO: Gamified Utility Meets Planned Growth The sole presale asset on whale watch lists is Yeti Ouro (YETIO), a meme-to-utility hybrid powering an Unreal Engine 5 racer called Yeti Go. Tokens act as in-game currency for cosmetic skins, kart upgrades and quarterly land drops, embedding real demand into gameplay. Stage 4 of the five-tier sale opened at $0.041 and has already shifted 245,053,120 YETIO, raising $4.31 million. Each completed stage automatically increases the price, rewarding early buyers while stretching funding momentum across the presale timeline. Tokenomics allocates 15% to play-to-earn rewards, 15% to user incentives, and 5% to burn—mechanics designed to tighten supply ahead of exchange launch. To turbo-charge adoption, Yeti Ouro’s $100k giveaway is currently live: five lucky winners will each receive $20k worth of YETIO. Entry details are available on the project website. With a blockbuster Solidproof audit in hand and a beta game demo slated for Q3 2025, the project gives whales exposure to a high-beta gaming narrative without sacrificing clear utility. Reading the Whale Signals Whale positioning never guarantees gains, yet consistent accumulation often precedes moves that retail traders feel months later. Bitcoin’s new peak suggests the cycle has further to run; the capital rotation into DOGE, ETH and YETIO shows where large wallets see the strongest second-leg opportunities. DOGE offers reflexive meme power underwritten by billion-token buys, ETH provides blue-chip exposure with a tightening float, and YETIO blends viral branding with a tangible play-to-earn economy plus planned supply shocks. For investors tracking smart money, Yeti Ouro stands out as the next chapter in 2025’s crypto story.

At the center of Metaplanet’s aggressive accumulation effort is EVO FUND, a Cayman Islands-based investment firm that has become its primary backer. Over recent months, EVO FUND has exclusively subscribed to multiple rounds of the company’s zero-interest bonds, providing crucial capital for Bitcoin purchases. The latest 16th Series bond issuance, also taken up by EVO FUND, brings the total raised to nearly $100m across various tranches. Zero-Interest Bonds Redeemable at Par, Proceeds Reserved Solely for BTC Acquisition Metaplanet clarified that each bond carries a face value of $1.25m and will be redeemed at par. The company has included provisions for early redemption, contingent on specific fundraising milestones involving the bondholder. *Metaplanet Issues 50 Million USD in 0% Ordinary Bonds to Purchase Additional $BTC * pic.twitter.com/Fz3J7i22XJ — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) May 28, 2025 Proceeds from this zero-coupon debt will go entirely toward the purchase of Bitcoin, continuing the company’s ongoing treasury diversification. Metaplanet noted that the issuance would have minimal immediate impact on its consolidated financials for the year ending Dec. 2025, but signaled it would update stakeholders if material effects arise. Short Sellers Pounce, Yet Metaplanet Ramps Up Institutional Bitcoin Strategy The announcement comes amid a wave of scrutiny over Metaplanet’s valuation. Research firm 10X Research recently flagged that the company’s stock trades at an implied Bitcoin price of $596,154 , over five times the actual market value. Short sellers have taken notice, making Metaplanet the most shorted stock in Japan. Despite market skepticism, Metaplanet has continued to expand. Last month, the company announced the launch of a wholly owned subsidiary in Florida to accelerate its Bitcoin treasury strategy in what it called a “rapidly emerging” crypto hub. CEO Simon Gerovich confirmed the move, citing planned capital of up to $250m to broaden access to institutional liquidity in the US. While critics question the sustainability of its approach, Metaplanet remains firm in its belief that Bitcoin offers a strategic hedge and long-term value. This latest bond issuance shows that conviction, even as the broader market evaluates the risks of asset-heavy balance sheets in volatile sectors.

2025-05-28T04:46:29.000Z,"Rep. Steil urges restraint on adding ‘non-germane items’ to crypto bills","US Representative Bryan Steil wants lawmakers to stop adding “non-germane items” into two key crypto bills, claiming that doing so is slowing the implementation of a regulatory framework for the industry. “Individuals, when they see legislation that’s going to move forward, want to attach non-germane items to any bill that’s going to move through and be signed into law,” Steil, a Republican from Wisconsin who chairs the House Financial Services Subcommittee on crypto, told Cointelegraph at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 27. “We have to restrain ourselves from that instinct and attempt by our colleagues — both sides of the aisle,” he added. Congress’s biggest crypto backers hope to pass the stablecoin-regulating Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act, and a crypto market structure bill before a month-long August recess. Democratic lawmakers had pulled support for the GENIUS Act on May 8, citing concerns about US President Donald Trump’s crypto ventures potentially conflicting with his presidential duties Stable Coin and Market Structure legislation will unlock the golden age of digital assets. pic.twitter.com/lSbX5p2Wqt — Bryan Steil (@RepBryanSteil) May 27, 2025 While the GENIUS Act eventually moved forward in the Senate with a May 20 procedural vote, Steil said the concerns related to Trump aren’t relevant to the bills themselves. “They’re not germane to the legislative text. The legislative text is focused on putting forward a regulatory framework in which we can enforce actions to strengthen this broader market, in particular to the benefit of American consumers and innovation and development here.” Democratic Senator Marker Warner voiced a similar sentiment before the GENIUS Act passed on May 19, stating that the US couldn’t “afford to keep standing on the sidelines” while the crypto industry evolves. “We cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay,” Warner said. “If American lawmakers don’t shape it, others will — and not in ways that serve our interests or democratic values.” Steil credits Democrats Steil acknowledged that Democratic lawmakers have made an effort to better understand the crypto industry’s gripes with how the Biden administration handled regulation and enforcement of the sector. He said the political landscape and nature of crypto-related negotiations “looked a little different,” but over 70 Democrats in the last Congress signaled the need for clear crypto rules when the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) passed the House in May 2024. Related: Trump supports bill to buy 1 million BTC — Senator Lummis “I think that was a great practice run,” said Steil. The FIT21 Act wasn’t enacted before the end of the last Congress However, House Agricultural and Financial Services Committee chairs Glenn Thompson and French Hill introduced a new crypto market structure bill on May 5 that aims to build on FIT21. If lawmakers pass those bills, they will have the opportunity to explore a lot of other “interesting, creative ideas” in the space, Steil said.

2025-05-28T04:40:17.000Z,"Block Unveils Revolutionary Bitcoin Payments Pilot Program","BitcoinWorld Block Unveils Revolutionary Bitcoin Payments Pilot Program Get ready for a potential shift in how we use digital currency! Block, Inc. , the payments giant led by Jack Dorsey and formerly known as Square, has just announced a significant step forward for cryptocurrency adoption in everyday transactions. At the recent Bitcoin 2025 conference held in Las Vegas, Block revealed a pilot program focused on facilitating seamless Block Bitcoin payments . What is the Block Bitcoin Payments Pilot Program? This exciting new initiative is designed to test and refine the process of using Bitcoin for retail purchases. Imagine walking into a store and paying with Bitcoin as easily as scanning a QR code. That’s the core idea behind Block’s pilot. The program allows participants to make payments by simply scanning a barcode displayed by the merchant. The real magic happens behind the scenes, leveraging the power of the Lightning Network . Here’s a breakdown of how it works in the pilot: Initiation: A customer wants to pay using Bitcoin. Display: The merchant system (in the pilot phase) generates a barcode or QR code representing the payment request. Scanning: The customer uses their Bitcoin wallet app to scan the code. Processing: The transaction is routed through the Lightning Network. Confirmation: Payment is confirmed in near real-time, often within seconds. This near real-time processing is a critical advantage of the Lightning Network over traditional on-chain Bitcoin transactions, which can be slower and more expensive, especially for small purchases. Block’s focus on the Lightning Network indicates a commitment to making Bitcoin payments practical for everyday commerce. Why is This a Big Deal for Square and Bitcoin Payments? While the initial announcement is about a pilot program, the long-term vision outlined by Block includes a massive expansion. The company plans to integrate this functionality directly into its flagship point-of-sale (POS) platform, Square. This integration is slated to begin rolling out in the second half of 2025, with the ambitious goal of reaching all Square sellers by 2026. This timeline, of course, is contingent on navigating the necessary regulatory approval processes. The potential impact of bringing Square Bitcoin payments to millions of businesses is enormous. Square is one of the most widely used POS systems globally, particularly among small and medium-sized businesses. Enabling Bitcoin payments on this platform could: Boost Bitcoin Adoption: Provide a familiar and accessible way for both merchants and consumers to engage with Bitcoin. Reduce Transaction Costs: Lightning Network fees are typically much lower than traditional payment processor fees. Increase Payment Speed: Near real-time settlements improve cash flow for businesses. Attract New Customers: Businesses accepting Bitcoin might appeal to a growing segment of cryptocurrency users. Drive Innovation: Encourage further development and integration of crypto payments. For Jack Dorsey Block has long been interested in Bitcoin’s potential, seeing it as a tool for economic empowerment and a potential global currency. This pilot program and subsequent Square integration represent a tangible step towards realizing that vision by making Bitcoin usable for everyday transactions. Challenges and Considerations for Wider Adoption While the announcement is exciting, several factors will influence the success and widespread adoption of Block Bitcoin payments on Square: Regulatory Landscape: Cryptocurrency regulations vary widely and are constantly evolving. Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval across different jurisdictions will be crucial and potentially challenging. User Experience: The process needs to be as simple and intuitive as using a credit card or mobile wallet for both customers and merchants. Wallet compatibility and ease of use are key. Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be volatile. Merchants will need clear mechanisms for handling price fluctuations between the time of sale and settlement, potentially using instant conversion services. Education: Both merchants and consumers will require education on how Bitcoin payments work, the benefits, and how to manage wallets and transactions securely. Network Capacity: While the Lightning Network is designed for scale, widespread adoption would test its capacity and reliability. Block will need to address these points effectively to ensure a smooth rollout and encourage broad participation from Square’s vast network of sellers and their customers. What Does This Mean for Businesses and Consumers? For businesses using or considering Square, the upcoming integration means a new potential payment rail. It might be time to start learning about Bitcoin and the Lightning Network to be prepared when the feature rolls out. Understanding the basics of receiving and potentially holding or converting Bitcoin will be important. For consumers, this could mean more places where you can spend Bitcoin. If you hold Bitcoin, especially in a Lightning-enabled wallet, you might soon have the option to use it for your daily coffee, groceries, or retail purchases at Square-enabled merchants. It adds another layer of utility to holding Bitcoin. Looking Ahead: The Future of Bitcoin Payments Block’s pilot program is a significant development, but it’s part of a larger trend. More companies are exploring how to integrate cryptocurrencies into traditional finance and commerce. The focus on the Lightning Network by major players like Block validates its potential as a scaling solution for Bitcoin payments. Success here could pave the way for even broader adoption, encouraging other payment processors and businesses to explore similar integrations. It brings the vision of using Bitcoin as a medium of exchange closer to reality for millions. Conclusion: A Bold Step Forward Block’s announcement of the Block Bitcoin payments pilot program and its planned integration into Square is a bold and potentially transformative move. By leveraging the speed and efficiency of the Lightning Network, Block is aiming to make Bitcoin payments practical and accessible for everyday transactions. While challenges remain, particularly regarding regulation and user education, the potential for expanding Square Bitcoin capabilities to millions of businesses marks a significant milestone in the journey towards mainstream cryptocurrency adoption. Keep an eye on Block’s progress – this pilot could be the spark that ignites wider acceptance of Bitcoin payments in the coming years.

2025-05-28T04:22:28.000Z,"HTX Research：The New Macroeconomic Landscape and Bitcoin Outlook: An Analysis of Liquidity, Risk Appetite, Policy Dynamics, and Investment Strategy","1. Overview Singapore, 28 May , 2025 – The global macroeconomic environment is undergoing profound adjustments, and the cryptocurrency market, especially Bitcoin price fluctuations, is increasingly affected by the complex influences of macro liquidity, market risk appetite, major policy trends, and investment strategy choices. In terms of liquidity, abundant funds often boost the prices of assets such as Bitcoin, while the opposite creates suppression. At the same time, given Bitcoin’s current high volatility and its periodic linkage with traditional risk assets (such as US stocks), the overall risk appetite of the market is also a key driver of its price performance. In addition, government fiscal, monetary and regulatory policies, as well as investment strategy choices for stablecoins and other crypto assets, are increasingly becoming important variables affecting market direction. This report will focus on four core dimensions: liquidity, risk appetite, policy game and investment strategy, to deeply analyze the key variables affecting the Bitcoin market in the current macro background, including the evolution of rate cut expectations, the continuation of Quantitative Tightening (QT), the dynamics of the US Treasury General Account (TGA), the monetary policy shifts of major economies such as Japan, as well as factors such as geopolitics, tax reduction policies, regulatory policies, institutional entry and stablecoin financial management, striving to provide investors with a clear outlook on the future market trend of Bitcoin through detailed data support and rigorous logical deduction. 2. Liquidity Analysis: Rate Cut Expectations Cooling, QT Continuing, TGA Reflowing in June, Yen Expected to Raise Rates, US Dollar Liquidity May Continue to Tighten in the Near Term 2.1 Rate Cut Expectations Cooling, Focus on Data and Tariffs Previously, the market had significant expectations for multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025. However, recent macroeconomic data and policy signals have led to a substantial adjustment of these expectations.. In mid-May 2025, following the release of US CPI data and an easing of US-China tariff, market expectations for Fed rate cuts this year have cooled. The prevailing sentiment now anticipates two rate cuts this year (September, December), a more cautious outlook compared to the previous expectation of three cuts, with the first in July. The core driving force for this change lies in Fed Chairman Powell’s firm stance, the continued strong performance of the job market, and ongoing concerns about the future inflation path, particularly potential tariff impacts . 2.1.1 Powell’s Stance: Adhering to “Data-Dependent”, Refusing to Pay for Tariffs Fed Chairman Powell has consistently emphasized a “data-dependent” policy stance in multiple public speeches, explicitly refusing to accommodate external pressures, such as those related to tariff policies. This means that any decision on rate cuts must be based on solid economic data. Key indicators include sustained progress towards the 2% inflation target and a significant cooling of the job market. This “Data-dependent” approach also aligns with Powell’s professional considerations. Powell’s term will end in May 2026, a premature rate cut without clear economic data support, followed by uncontrolled inflation, would directly signify a policy failure on his part. Conversely, if the U.S. economy were to enter a recession during his tenure, necessitating rapid rate cuts, such a downturn could be attributed to broader policy impacts. Consequently, Powell is inclined to await more definitive economic signals before implementing rate cuts, thereby mitigating unnecessary policy risks.. In addition, Powell’s refusal to “pay for tariffs” signifies an unwillingness to implicitly endorse policies that introduce market uncertainty by cutting rates to offset tariff-induced shocks. However, Powell has also indicated in past speeches that the Federal Reserve would intervene if market volatility threatened the stability of the financial system. Therefore, Powell is likely to prioritize clear data support for inflation and employment before initiating any rate cuts, potentially disregarding political pressures. These two core economic indicators remain central to future rate cut decisions. . 2.1.2 Job Market: Strong Performance Supports High Interest Rates The continued strength of the US job market is a pivotal factor supporting the Fed’s decision to maintain the current elevated interest rate environment. Current US economic data underscores this resilience., In April 2025, non-farm payrolls increased by 177,000, significantly exceeding the anticipated 130,000, while the unemployment rate stood at a robust 4.2%. Multiple indicators suggest this strong employment trend is likely to persist. In terms of tariff conflicts , the unexpected easing of US-China tariff conflicts is proving beneficial for US export industries targeting the Chinese market, which will undoubtedly have a positive impact on US economic growth and the job market. Furthermore, potential tariff revenue could alleviate fiscal pressure, indirectly support government spending and contribute to overall economic health. In terms of corporate performance , First-quarter reports from US listed companies reveal strong results, with 73% of S&P 500 index constituents reporting earnings that surpassed expectations This positive corporate performance bodes well for employment and investment. In terms of employment , recent data is strong, reinforcing the expectation that the economy will not be weak in the short term, and the unemployment rate is unlikely to break the key threshold of 4.5% in the short term. As long as the job market avoids a sharp deterioration, the Fed has ample justification to maintain high interest rates to combat inflation. However, it is important to note that some data suggests a nascent trend of deterioration in the US job market, requiring ongoing observation. As long as the job market avoids a sharp deterioration, such as a surge in the unemployment rate or new job additions consistently falling significantly below expectations or even turning negative, the Fed will retain greater policy flexibility. This allows the Fed to prioritize inflation control without the immediate need to stimulate the economy through rate cuts. A strong job market means continued support for wage growth, which could exert persistent upward pressure on service inflation, thereby complicating the overall trajectory of inflation decline. 2.1.3 Inflation Outlook: CPI Year-on-Year Temporarily Creates New Low, Tariff Shock May Appear in the Third Quarter While the US CPI in April 2025 fell to 2.3% year-on-year, marking its lowest level since February 2021, this trend has, to some extent, assuaged immediate market anxieties about a resurgence in inflation and initially boosted rate cut expectations.. However, judgment on the future inflation outlook still needs to be cautious. The risk point currently highly concerned by the market is the potential impact of US-China tariff policies. Even with recent easing in US-China tariff conflicts, some imported goods still face high tariffs, with costs mostly borne by consumers. Goods subject to tariffs of over 30% entering the US in the coming months may trigger a one-time inflation shock. Internal research by the Fed also supports the view that tariffs may cause a one-time shock to inflation. Nationwide economist Ayres predicts that the summer CPI year-on-year may return to above 3%. This potential upward risk of inflation driven by tariffs will undoubtedly increase the complexity of the Fed’s rate cut decisions and may further delay the timing of rate cuts. Summary In summary, despite the recent slight improvement in CPI data, Fed Chairman Powell’s cautious “data-dependent” stance, the continued strong job market, and concerns about future (especially third quarter) inflation shocks that may be triggered by tariffs have collectively led to a significant cooling of market expectations for Fed rate cuts this year. In the short term, market liquidity expectations are thus suppressed, and the upside for risk assets such as Bitcoin may be limited. 2.2 The Fed’s “Balance Sheet Reduction” is Ongoing, TGA Will Reflow in June, Liquidity May Contract Periodically. If Debt Ceiling Agreement is Reached in August, TGA May Extract Liquidity in the Short Term In addition to expected changes in interest rate policy, the Fed’s balance sheet reduction plan (i.e., Quantitative Tightening, QT) and its interaction with the Treasury’s TGA account are also key variables affecting market liquidity. Since June 2022, the Fed has actively engaged in reducing its massive balance sheet, aiming to withdraw excess liquidity from the market. The official policy path still tends to end this round of balance sheet reduction in the second half of 2025. Looking at SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate), an indicator reflecting the degree of funding tightness within the US federal funds market, SOFR has demonstrated relative stability recently, at most reaching the level of IORB (Interest on Reserve Balances), with limited market funding tightness. If subsequent volatility expands, it will need to be closely monitored. Looking at the ratio of Fed depository institution reserves to commercial bank total assets, it is still above 13%, in a state where liquidity is not tight. Based on past experience, when this ratio is less than 10-12%, market interest rates will experience more obvious fluctuations, such as the brief liquidity crisis in the second half of 2019. In summary, this means that in the coming months, QT will continue and withdraw liquidity from the market, although its marginal impact may weaken as the balance sheet reduction approaches its end. A more direct impact onliquidity shock may come from the dynamics of the US Treasury’s TGA account. The TGA represents the Treasury’s deposit account at the Fed, and changes in its balance directly affect the level of reserves in the banking system, thereby affecting market liquidity. When the TGA balance increases, it means that the Treasury absorbs funds from the market and deposits them into the Fed, leading to a decrease in bank reserves and tightening liquidity; conversely, when the TGA balance decreases, it releases liquidity. Currently, the TGA account is experiencing continuously outflows,thereby supplementing market liquidity, but it is expected that in June 2025, with the seasonality of tax revenue, the TGA account balance may see a significant rebound, which will create periodic contraction pressure on short-term market liquidity. In addition, the US debt ceiling issue is another important uncertainty factor. According to the latest forecast by the Bipartisan Policy Center, if Congress fails to suspend or raise the debt ceiling in time, the so-called “X-date” (the day when federal government funds are exhausted) may come between August and early October 2025.) The US Treasury Secretary has also warned that the “X-date” may come in August. Historically, debt ceiling issues are often resolved at the last minute, but the game process before that brings uncertainty to the market. Once the debt ceiling issue is resolved, for example in August, the Treasury typically quickly replenishes the previously consumed TGA account funds through large-scale bond issuance. This will lead to a rapid increase in the TGA balance in the short term, thereby extracting a large amount of liquidity from the market, impacting the financial market, especially the short-term interest rate market. Therefore, considering all factors, the Fed’s continued balance sheet reduction operations, coupled with the seasonal reflux of the TGA account in June, and the rapid replenishment of the TGA account after the debt ceiling issue is resolved in August, are all likely to exert periodic tightening pressure on US dollar liquidity in the coming months. 2.3 Yen Rate Hike Expectations Heating Up, Carry Trade Further Contracting Among major central banks, the continued policy shift of the Bank of Japan (BOJ) is another factor that may have a profound impact on global and US dollar liquidity. For a long time, the Bank of Japan has maintained an ultra-loose monetary policy, making the yen one of the main funding currencies for global carry trades. This dynamic involves investors borrowing low-cost yen to invest in higher-yielding assets in other countries, thereby objectively injecting liquidity into the global market. However, with the gradual emergence of inflation pressure in Japan and the improvement of economic prospects, the Bank of Japan has begun to continuously adjust its monetary policy stance. The Bank of Japan has already raised its policy rate from 0.25% to 0.5% on January 24, 2025, while also raising its expected increase in core CPI for fiscal year 2025 from 1.9% to 2.4%, showing that its judgment on the persistence of inflation has strengthened. The market generally expects that the Bank of Japan may continue its pace of rate hikes in 2025. The continued rate hikes by the Bank of Japan may affect global and US dollar liquidity through the following paths: Narrowing the US-Japan interest rate differential, suppressing carry trades: The Bank of Japan’s rate hikes will directly push up yen financing costs, narrowing the interest rate differential between Japan and other major economies (especially the US). When the US-Japan interest rate differential narrows to a certain extent, the attractiveness of yen carry trades will significantly decrease, possibly leading to some carry trades being unwound, i.e., selling overseas assets to exchange back to yen to repay loans. This process is equivalent to withdrawing liquidity from the global market (including the US dollar market). Enhanced attractiveness of yen assets, funds flowing back to Japan: As Japan’s interest rate levels rise and its economic outlook improves, domestic Japanese assets, such as yen-denominated bonds and stocks, may become more attractive to international investors, possibly attracting some funds that were previously invested overseas (including US dollar assets) to flow back to Japan, which will also have a certain siphoning effect on global US dollar liquidity. Changes in market expectations and risk aversion sentiment: The continued normalization of the Bank of Japan’s policy may change the market’s expectation of a long-term continuation of the global low interest rate environment. In specific market conditions, if the yen strengthens due to rate hikes, it may also attract some funds to flow in during times of heightened risk aversion, indirectly affecting the liquidity allocation of other markets. Although the Fed’s future rate cut pace will also affect the dynamics of the US-Japan interest rate differential, the Bank of Japan’s gradual exit from ultra-loose policy and entry into a rate hike channel is undoubtedly an important variable in the global liquidity landscape. Its continued tightening actions, especially in the context of the Fed not yet significantly easing, may put further pressure on global, especially US dollar, liquidity supply. 2.4 Market Liquidity Summary and Forecast: Short-term Tightening, Mid-term Gradual Improvement with Variables 2.4.1 Short-term (next 1-3 months) liquidity outlook: Tight Continued impact of Fed policy: Before inflation data shows persistent and convincing decline and the job market shows significant cooling, the Fed will most likely maintain the current interest rate level unchanged, with rate cut expectations continuing to be pushed back. At the same time, Quantitative Tightening (QT) is still proceeding as planned, continuously withdrawing liquidity from the market. Seasonal and policy shocks of the TGA account: In June 2025, the TGA account may see a seasonal rebound due to factors such as tax inflows, causing short-term liquidity withdrawal. More importantly, if the US debt ceiling issue is resolved around August, the Treasury’s large-scale debt issuance to quickly replenish the TGA account will significantly tighten market liquidity, possibly causing volatility in the short-term interest rate market. Spillover effects of Bank of Japan tightening: If the Bank of Japan continues its rate hike trajectory, it will further narrow the US-Japan interest rate differential, possibly prompting some yen carry trades to unwind, reducing the supply of yen liquidity to the global market, indirectly creating a tightening effect on US dollar liquidity. Market performance expectations: Under the combined effect of the above factors, overall market liquidity is expected to maintain a tight stance in the short term, and may even experience periodic liquidity tension. For risk assets such as Bitcoin, this means that upside may face greater resistance, and market volatility may intensify. 2.4.2 Mid-term (next 3-12 months) liquidity outlook: Gradual improvement but with significant variables Fed policy shift’s gradual nature: The market generally expects the Fed to initiate a rate cut cycle in the second half or end of 2025, and end QT in the second half of 2025. If this expectation materializes, it will bring substantial marginal improvement to market liquidity. However, the magnitude and pace of rate cuts will be highly dependent on economic data (inflation, employment) at that time, with significant uncertainty. If inflation is stubborn or the economy is unexpectedly strong, the timing of rate cuts may be further delayed, and the extent of improvement will also be limited. Manifestation and digestion of tariff impact: If the inflation shock brought by US-China tariffs appears as expected in the third quarter and is gradually absorbed by the market, without triggering uncontrolled inflation expectations, then in the context of subsequent inflation data decline, the Fed’s policy space may reopen. But if the tariff shock exceeds expectations, it may extend the duration of high interest rates and tightening policies. Synchronicity of global central bank policies: Looking at the mid-term, if inflation in major economies is effectively controlled, central bank policies may gradually shift towards easing, forming a synergistic effect that collectively enhances the global liquidity environment. But if the recovery pace of major economies is uneven, policy divergence may intensify, making the path of global liquidity improvement more tortuous. Potential impact of “black swan” events: Escalation of geopolitical conflicts, unexpected financial risks in major economies, and other unforeseen “black swan” events may all have a significant impact on mid-term liquidity expectations. Market performance expectations: Looking to the mid-term, market liquidity is expected to gradually transition from the current tight state to marginal improvement, but the improvement process may be gradual and full of twists and turns. Risk assets such as Bitcoin may gain breathing and rebound opportunities during windows of improved liquidity expectations, but sustained upward movement still requires clearer signals of liquidity easing and fundamental support. Investors need to closely monitor the evolution of various macroeconomic data and policy signals, and flexibly adjust expectations. In summary, for the immediate future, the overall market liquidity environment remains unoptimistic, with short-term tight pressure being relatively certain, while mid-term improvement expectations exist, both the path and magnitude of this improvement are subject to considerable uncertainty. For the Bitcoin market, which is highly dependent on liquidity, this means a need to more cautiously assess risks and be fully prepared for market volatility. 3. Risk Appetite Analysis: Short-term Boost, Mid-term Uncertainty Still Exists Market risk appetite is another core driver affecting the prices of risk assets such as Bitcoin. Recently, a series of events have had complex effects on market sentiment, overall showing a pattern of short-term boost but significant mid-term uncertainty still existing. 3.1 Tariffs Better Than Expected in Short Term, Mid-term Uncertainty Still Exists The US-China tariff issue has consistently been a significant driver of global market sentiment, with any developments directly influencing investor risk appetite. In mid-May 2025, economic and trade talks between China and the US yielded an unexpected consensus on tariffs, with both sides agreeing to significantly reduce previously imposed high tariffs within the next 90 days. This breakthrough surpassed the expectations of many market analysts and has provided a clear boost to short-term market risk appetite.: Market sentiment quickly improved: After the news was announced, global capital markets reacted positively, with risk asset prices generally rising. Recession concerns eased: Previously, the market was concerned that escalating US-China trade frictions might lead the global economy into recession, or at least a “hard landing”. The easing of tariffs has reduced the probability of this extreme risk occurring. Corporate earnings expectations improved: High tariffs directly increase corporate operating costs and erode profitability. The reduction or suspension of tariffs helps improve the earnings outlook for companies in related industries, thereby boosting investor confidence in these companies’ stocks. However, although the easing of tariffs has brought positive effects in the short term, uncertainty still exists in the mid-term: Nature of the 90-day buffer period: The agreement reached has a 90-day buffer or suspension period. This means it is not a final solution, and both parties still need to negotiate further arrangements after 90 days. Should a more comprehensive, longer-term agreement is not reached by then, or if new friction points emerge, the tariff issue may escalate again, reversing the current optimistic sentiment. Structural contradictions still exist: Behind the US-China trade frictions are manifestations of deep-seated contradictions in economic structure, technological competition, geopolitics, and other aspects between the two countries. These structural contradictions are difficult to completely eliminate in the short term, which may lead to long-term and complex game-playing in the trade field. Therefore, while the tariff easing has indeed provided a significant short-term boost to market risk appetite, benefiting risk assets like Bitcoin, investors must remain vigilant regarding the uncertainty beyond the 90-day buffer period and the enduring, complex nature of US-China trade frictions. Any future developments concerning tariffs will continue to be a crucial disruptive factor influencing overall market risk appetite. 3.2 Geopolitical Situation Still Unclear, But Shows Signs of Improvement (Russia-Ukraine Conflict May End, India-Pakistan Conflict Temporary Ceasefire) Geopolitical risk is an important factor affecting global market risk appetite, and any escalation or easing of conflicts may trigger significant fluctuations in market sentiment. Recently, some positive signals have emerged in some major geopolitical conflict areas. Although the overall situation remains unclear, the marginal improvement helps repair short-term risk appetite. India-Pakistan conflict temporary ceasefire: The tensions between India and Pakistan that have attracted attention recently showed signs of easing in early May 2025. After a period of mutual accusations and escalating military actions, India and Pakistan have agreed to a temporary ceasefire under external mediation or their own considerations. Although this ceasefire is described by some media as a “fragile peace” and its durability remains to be seen, it undoubtedly alleviates the risk of a large-scale conflict erupting in the South Asian subcontinent in the short term. With the easing of international conflicts such as India-Pakistan, global risk aversion sentiment has receded somewhat, which is favorable for risk assets. Potential changes in the Russia-Ukraine conflict: The Russia-Ukraine conflict has lasted for several years and has had a profound impact on global energy prices, supply chains, and the geopolitical landscape. Following his assumption of office, President Trump has actively sought to promote a ceasefire between the two sides, and Russia has also conveyed signals of openness to such a possibility.. If there are any signs of substantive ceasefire negotiations, softening of positions by major participants, or progress in external mediation, it could significantly boost global market risk appetite. Conversely, if the conflict escalates again or spills over, it will quickly suppress market sentiment. Dynamics of conflicts in other regions: In addition to the above hotspots, the situation in other potential conflict points around the world (such as the Middle East, the Korean Peninsula, etc.) also needs attention. Any unexpected outbreak of conflict or escalation of tensions could rapidly change the landscape of global risk appetite. Overall, the recent temporary ceasefire in the India-Pakistan conflict is a positive development, helping to cool market risk aversion sentiment in the short term. However, the overall uncertainty of the global geopolitical situation remains high, the direction of the Russia-Ukraine conflict is still unclear, and other potential risk points still exist. Therefore, the impact of geopolitical factors on market risk appetite will be dynamic, and investors need to closely monitor relevant developments and be alert to any events that may cause sudden changes in market sentiment. 3.3 International Institutional Entry: Deploying Cryptocurrencies or Holding Bitcoin-Listed Companies The increasing participation of institutional investors serves as a crucial indicator of an asset class’s maturity and overall market confidence. In recent years, despite the dramatic fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market, international institutions’ interest in and deployment of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, has not stopped, but rather shows a trend of continuous deepening and diversification. This trend provides a positive support for market risk appetite in the medium to long term. Continued growth in the scale of listed companies holding Bitcoin: An increasing number of publicly traded companies are integrating Bitcoin into their treasury reserves or making direct investments in the cryptocurrency. According to Bitwise data, in the first quarter of 2025, the total amount of Bitcoin held by globally publicly traded companies exceeded 688,000, with a quarter-on-quarter growth of 16.11%, accounting for 3.28% of the total Bitcoin supply. CoinEdition points out that listed companies have purchased more than 196,000 Bitcoin so far in 2025, exceeding the new Bitcoin supply mined during the same period, reflecting the growing demand for corporate inflation hedging and strategic reserves. MicroStrategy and Tesla are typical representatives. The Bitcoin holding behavior of these listed companies not only directly increases the demand for Bitcoin, but also conveys to the market the institutional recognition of Bitcoin’s long-term value, thereby boosting overall market confidence. Potential interest from sovereign funds and pension funds: Although currently disclosed information is limited, market speculation suggests that some sovereign wealth funds and large pension funds are actively researching or making small-scale allocations to crypto assets. If more such large long-term investors enter the market in the future, it will have a more profound impact on the Bitcoin market. In summary, in the short term, market risk appetite has been boosted by tariff easing, marginal improvement in the geopolitical situation, and continued institutional entry, but in the mid-term, many uncertainty factors still exist, and market sentiment may still fluctuate with the progress of key events. For high-volatility assets like Bitcoin, their price performance will be highly dependent on the direction of overall market risk appetite, while positive changes at the policy level are laying the foundation for structural improvement in its risk appetite. 3.4 Risk Appetite Level Summary and Outlook In the short term (next 1-3 months), market risk appetite has been significantly boosted by factors such as the 90-day easing agreement on US-China tariffs, marginal improvement in the geopolitical situation such as the temporary ceasefire in the India-Pakistan conflict, and continued international institutional entry into cryptocurrencies. This optimistic sentiment is expected to continue in the short term, providing support for risk assets such as Bitcoin. However, the market still needs to be vigilant about technical corrections after the previous positive news is digested, as well as emotional fluctuations brought by sudden news. Looking at the mid-term (next 3-12 months), market risk appetite faces greater uncertainty, but also has the potential for structural improvement. Key variables influencing mid-term risk appetite include the trajectory of US-China trade relations after the 90-day tariff buffer period concludes, the evolution of major geopolitical risks such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the growth prospects and policy paths of major global economies. If these factors all develop in a positive direction, market risk appetite is expected to continue to improve; otherwise, it may come under pressure again. Whether institutional funds can continue to flow into the crypto market on a large scale will also be an important indicator measuring mid-term market confidence. 4. Policy Game and Fiscal Trends: Tax Cuts, Regulation, and Strategic Reserves’ Multidimensional Impact Beyond liquidity and risk appetite, policy-level games and changes are increasingly becoming key variables affecting the crypto market. This chapter will deeply analyze the Trump administration’s tax reduction policy, the dynamics of cryptocurrency strategic reserves at the US federal and state levels, the evolution of the stablecoin regulatory framework, and the latest progress in innovative policies such as US stock tokenization, exploring the potential impact paths of these policy variables on Bitcoin and other crypto assets. 4.1 “Big Beautiful Tax Plan” Reappears: Stimulus and Deficit Coexist President Trump, who took office in early 2025, is actively promoting his signature “Big Beautiful Tax Plan”, which will have a profound impact on macro liquidity and market risk appetite. In early May, the House Ways and Means Committee released part of the tax cut bill, with core content including making the 2017 tax cuts permanent and raising the child tax credit cap. At the same time, Senate Republicans passed a budget resolution in April, authorizing a total tax cut of $5 trillion over the next 10 years, including $1.5 trillion in new tax cuts, while raising the debt ceiling by $5 trillion. This transcendent fiscal stimulus plan is described by the Trump administration as injecting “rocket fuel” into the economy, aimed at stimulating economic growth. However, such a large-scale tax cut plan, accompanied by the reality that spending cuts are difficult to implement, will inevitably expand the fiscal deficit and need to be accompanied by raising the debt ceiling. According to authoritative institution estimates, the permanent extension of the 2017 tax reform alone will add about $4.6 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years. The Trump administration has also proposed partially offsetting the cost of tax cuts by significantly increasing tariff revenue, but this strategy may have the side effects of suppressing trade activities and raising prices. Overall, this tax policy is biased towards easing in the short term, which is favorable for risk asset sentiment, but in the mid-term, concerns about fiscal sustainability will rise significantly. 4.2 Positive Signals of Crypto-Friendly Policies and Latest Progress in US Stock Tokenization Exploration Recently, the United States has shown some positive signals in cryptocurrency regulation and innovation, especially at the policy level and market practice level, providing new catalysts for the improvement of risk appetite. 4.2.1 Policy Environment Has Begun to Change and Legislative Attempts Are Being Made Although the comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the US is still forming, some positive developments worth noting have emerged at the legislative level. The US Senate has made significant progress in stablecoin legislation. The much-anticipated “GENIUS Act” aims to provide a clear framework for stablecoin issuance and regulation. Reports as of mid-May 2025 indicate that related negotiations have reached consensus on approximately 90% of the terms, and a key Senate vote has already taken place around May 19, with the bill advancing. The core content of the bill includes Federal Reserve regulation for stablecoin issuers with assets exceeding $10 billion, while smaller institutions are regulated by state-level regulatory authorities, and requires all stablecoins to be 100% backed by high-quality liquid assets such as US dollar cash or short-term US Treasury bonds. Recent amendments also address strengthening rules for technology companies entering financial assets, enhancing consumer protection mechanisms, and reinforcing oversight of government officials’ related activities.. Although the House has previously passed a similar “STABLE Act”, and the Senate has once been hindered due to key Democratic senators withdrawing support, both parties are still actively promoting it. In addition, the Northern Mariana Islands has recently passed its regional stablecoin bill, allowing the issuance of the “Tinian Island Stablecoin” pegged to the US dollar. These legislative efforts, whether at the federal or local level, indicate that regulation is transitioning from pure observation or scattered enforcement actions towards providing clearer guidance and standardized development for the market, which is crucial for the long-term healthy development of the stablecoin market and the stability of overall crypto market risk appetite. In addition, discussions on digital asset market structure are also underway, aiming to balance innovation and investor protection. Although the process may be long and full of game-playing, these legislative efforts themselves indicate that regulation is transitioning from pure suppression to standardized development, which is crucial for the stability of long-term risk appetite. 4.2.2 US Stock Tokenization Exploration and Latest Progress US stock tokenization, that is, transforming traditional stocks into digital tokens (Security Token Offering, STO) through blockchain technology, is becoming a new emerging field of market attention. This innovation aims to improve the liquidity, accessibility, and trading efficiency of US stocks, reduce transaction costs, and may provide more convenient investment channels for global investors. According to the latest market dynamics, the exploration of US stock tokenization is accelerating: Regulatory attention and discussion: The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has shown continued attention to tokenization. For example, the SEC’s Special Working Group on Crypto Assets held a roundtable on tokenization issues on May 12, 2025, to explore its potential regulatory framework and market impact. SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw also delivered a keynote speech at the meeting, indicating that regulatory agencies are actively researching and evaluating this emerging field. Market participants’ active practice: Specific stock tokenization platforms are already emerging in the market. For example, MyStonks announced the launch of its on-chain US stock token market on May 10, 2025, and emphasized that its tokens are backed by 100% custodial assets, marking the gradual implementation of compliant US stock tokenization trading platforms. Entry of traditional financial institutions and infrastructure construction: Large traditional financial institutions have also begun to deploy in the tokenization field. JPMorgan announced at the Consensus conference in May 2025 that it has successfully completed settlement tests of tokenized US Treasury bonds on public blockchains in collaboration with Ondo Finance and Chainlink, and expressed a positive outlook for broader securities tokenization (including stocks). In addition, asset management company VanEck also announced on May 15, 2025, the launch of its tokenized US Treasury fund on multiple blockchain networks. Although these developments are not directly equivalent to US stock tokenization, they lay important infrastructure and practical experience for the overall asset tokenization, especially the on-chain circulation and settlement of securities assets, indicating that US stock tokenization may receive stronger technical and market support in the future. Growth expectations of market size: Industry research institutions have optimistic expectations for the market size of tokenized assets. For example, Markets Media’s report on May 14, 2025, cited research indicating that the tokenization scale of real-world assets (RWA) is expected to grow from about $0.6 trillion in 2025 to $18.9 trillion in 2030, with the tokenization of securities assets being an important component. Although US stock tokenization still faces challenges at the legal level (such as the issue of “equal rights for stocks and tokens”) and regulatory approval, its huge potential and the positive interaction between regulation and the market have attracted widespread attention from the industry. If regulatory policies can gradually become clear and support such innovation, the advancement of US stock tokenization will greatly expand the application scenarios of digital assets, and may attract more traditional financial institutions and investors to enter the crypto field, thereby significantly enhancing market risk appetite. Trend of incorporating crypto assets into traditional financial products: In addition to US stock tokenization, discussions on incorporating cryptocurrencies (especially Bitcoin) into traditional financial products (such as the 401(k) retirement plans mentioned by Coinbase CEO) are also heating up. If such integration is achieved, it will bring considerable incremental funds and a broader investor base to the crypto market, which is a great boost to market confidence and risk appetite. 4.3 Latest Progress of US Federal and State Bitcoin Strategic Reserves New regulations on “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” at the US federal level: Recently, there have been some discussions and legislative attempts at the US federal level regarding the establishment of a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve”, which has profound significance for the positioning of Bitcoin and institutional acceptance. According to a presidential action released by the White House on March 6, 2025, it mentioned the initiative to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve and US digital asset reserve, and pointed out that government Bitcoin deposited in the strategic Bitcoin reserve “shall not be sold and shall be maintained as a reserve asset of the United States”. Furthermore, relevant legislative proposals exist at the US Congressional level, such as the 2025 BITCOIN Act (S.954), which aims to formalize a strategic Bitcoin reserve and ensure transparent management of federal government Bitcoin holdings. These federal-level initiatives, even in their preliminary stages, significantly elevate Bitcoin’s status as a strategic asset, providing stronger policy expectations and legal endorsement for institutional investors to include it in their asset allocation strategies. US states have made uneven progress in incorporating Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into reserve assets, but the overall trend is noteworthy. New Hampshire took the lead in early May 2025 by passing the landmark H.B. 302 bill, formally authorizing the establishment of a state-level strategic crypto reserve, allowing the state treasurer to invest up to 5% of state funds in digital assets including Bitcoin and precious metals, becoming the first state in the US to achieve such legislation. This breakthrough provides an important demonstration effect for other states. However, not all state attempts have been smooth sailing. For example, a similar bill in Arizona aimed at incorporating Bitcoin into state reserves was vetoed by the governor in May 2025. According to the latest statistics, about 26 states across the US are considering or have proposed legislative drafts related to Bitcoin reserves, but the final prospects of many bills remain unclear, and proposals in some states have also encountered resistance or been vetoed. Nevertheless, these positive explorations and legislative attempts at the state level, whether successful or not, reflect that the recognition of Bitcoin as a potential reserve asset is gradually deepening, and may pave the way for attracting more traditional institutional investors (such as pension funds, endowment funds, etc.) to pay attention to and allocate Bitcoin, although the process may be full of challenges. 4.4 Policy Game Summary and Outlook The current policy environment presents a complex and evolving dynamic, characterized by both positive catalysts and potential risk points. The Trump administration’s large-scale tax cut plan will boost market sentiment in the short term, but may cause liquidity fluctuations in the mid-term due to the expansion of the fiscal deficit; policy explorations regarding Bitcoin strategic reserves at the US federal and state levels, as well as the gradual clarification of the stablecoin regulatory framework, are paving the way for the institutionalization and mainstreaming of crypto assets; the advancement of innovative policies such as US stock tokenization provides new imagination space for the expansion of digital asset application scenarios. Investors should closely monitor the specific implementation of the tax cut bill, the final establishment and implementation of regulations related to strategic Bitcoin reserves, the improvement of the stablecoin regulatory framework, and the implementation of innovative policies such as US stock tokenization will be key variables affecting the structural changes in the crypto market. The outcomes of these policy deliberations will directly affect the direction of market liquidity and risk appetite, thereby having a profound impact on the price performance of Bitcoin and other crypto assets. Investors need to grasp the structural opportunities brought by long-term institutionalization trends while paying attention to short-term policy fluctuations. 5. Stablecoin Financial Management Strategies and Yield Comparison in the Current Environment In the face of the current macro and regulatory environment, stable yield-generating stablecoin financial management strategies are favored by investors. In the high interest rate background, some USD stablecoin financial solutions can already provide yields comparable to or even exceeding traditional markets, while the risk is relatively controllable. The following will introduce several recently hot stablecoin financial management strategies in the market, including their annualized yields, risk characteristics, and will be supplemented with charts comparing the yields of different strategies, helping readers with different risk preferences to choose optimally. 5.1 Backpack Backpack Exchange provides a one-stop trading and financial management platform, and its USD lending model has attracted attention recently. Backpack increases lending rates to give lenders extra returns . Currently, lending USD on Backpack can earn about 4.94% APY total return, including the basic market interest rate and 3.8% additional incentives. This yield is not particularly high compared to other platforms, but it excels in simplicity and transparency (essentially lending USDC to margin traders to earn interest). Backpack is suitable for low-risk preference users to obtain a rate slightly higher than money market funds. 5.2 Resolv Resolv Labs’ USR stablecoin strategy is a true Delta-neutral yield model. It hedges price risk through position combinations, while generating returns from funding rates of futures perpetual contracts and other risk-free arbitrage opportunities, then separating the returns to RLP token holders, keeping USR stable at 1:1. The current comprehensive annualized yield of this strategy is about 15% , part of which comes from incentives from protocols such as Pendle. The USR pool on the Base chain on the Pendle platform shows about 17.0% APY (including Pendle reward contributions), while the USR yield on Ethereum is slightly lower at about 9.4%. Overall, Resolv USR is a high-yield stablecoin, but it should be noted that it is backed by complex derivative strategies and incentive tokens. 5.3 Aave + Pendle This refers to depositing funds into lending protocols such as Aave to earn basic interest (e.g., depositing USDC to get 4%), and then tokenizing future interest through Pendle for trading, to lock in higher fixed rates or mine Pendle incentives. Currently, products on the Pendle platform that lock in Aave/Compound interest rates, such as CUSDC, CUSDT pools, have annualized rates of around 11%. For example, Compound’s USD stablecoin yield token CUSDO in the Pendle pool has an APY of about 11.5%. This means that through Pendle, users have the opportunity to amplify Aave’s 4-5% interest rate to nearly double digits (part of the return comes from Pendle platform rewards). The advantage is that it is still based on the interest of top lending protocols, with high security; the disadvantage is that it requires accepting Pendle token floating rewards and a certain operational threshold. All things considered, this strategy can currently achieve ~10% annualized returns . 5.4 Falcon Finance Falcon has launched the USDf (sUSDf) synthetic stablecoin strategy. Its model is to stake various assets to mint USDf, and through protocol design, USDf holders earn high yields. According to reports, USDf staking can provide over 10% APY . Falcon has recently integrated with Pendle, incorporating sUSDf into Pendle pools, further increasing on-chain yield rates. The Falcon strategy offers tempting returns, but it should be noted that USDf is an emerging synthetic asset, and systemic risk and collateral quality need to be evaluated. 5.5 Coinshift csUSDL The csUSDL launched by Coinshift is an institutional-grade stablecoin yield token . It is based on USDL issued by Paxos (100% backed by short-term US Treasury bonds and cash), with on-chain lending interest from the Morpho protocol added on top. Users holding csUSDL can automatically increase their balance daily without the need for locking or staking. Since the underlying assets are T-Bills and Aave lending, csUSDL returns mainly come from US Treasury bond interest (currently about 5%) plus DeFi interest, with a current total APY of around 10% . Its advantages are high transparency, security (supported by regulated assets + smart contract audits), and liquidity supported through Curve and others. Its disadvantage is that the yield rate is not outstanding but still better than traditional bank interest rates. 6. Conclusion and Investment Outlook: Multidimensional Impact of Liquidity, Risk Appetite, Policy and Investment Strategy Combining the four dimensions of liquidity, risk appetite, policy game and investment strategy, we make the following judgment on the Bitcoin market outlook: In the short term (next 1-3 months): The Bitcoin market may show a pattern of intensified volatility or even downward pressure. On one hand, the significantly tight liquidity expectation, especially the potential shock from the unwinding of yen carry trades, will limit its upside space; on the other hand, the improvement in risk appetite in the short term may provide some support, but it is difficult to completely offset the negative impact of tightening liquidity. The Trump administration’s tax cut policy, while boosting market sentiment in the short term, could introduce liquidity shocks in the third quarter due to potential US debt ceiling issues and the need for Treasury General Account (TGA) replenishment. The market may see a correction after consolidation at high levels, or experience violent fluctuations within a range. Investors need to closely monitor the release of various macroeconomic data, policy signals, and the latest developments in tariffs and geopolitical situations, operate flexibly, and pay high attention to risk control. In the mid-term (next 3-12 months): The direction of the Bitcoin market will be more uncertain, with both opportunities and challenges. If global liquidity can achieve marginal improvement as expected, and market risk appetite continues to warm up due to the positive resolution of various uncertainty factors (especially the positive implementation of regulatory policies and the deepening of institutional adoption), then Bitcoin is expected to usher in a new round of upward trend. Policy explorations regarding Bitcoin strategic reserves at the US federal and state levels, as well as the gradual clarification of the stablecoin regulatory framework, are paving the way for the institutionalization and mainstreaming of crypto assets; the advancement of innovative policies such as US stock tokenization provides new imagination space for the expansion of digital asset application scenarios. However, if liquidity tightening exceeds expectations, or frequent risk events lead to a sharp rise in risk aversion sentiment, Bitcoin may also face significant correction pressure. Key points to watch: In the coming period, investors should focus on the following aspects: The Fed’s policy path: including interest rate decisions, the end point and method of QT, and public statements by Powell and other officials. US inflation and employment data: These are the core basis affecting Fed decisions. Subsequent progress of US-China tariff negotiations : The direction after the 90-day buffer period is crucial. Evolution of major global geopolitical risks : Especially the Russia-Ukraine conflict, India-Pakistan conflict, and Middle East situation. Changes in the US TGA account and debt ceiling issues : The potential impact on short-term liquidity cannot be ignored. Bank of Japan’s monetary policy and yen carry trade dynamics : Direct impact on global liquidity allocation and US dollar liquidity. Progress of global cryptocurrency regulatory policies : Especially legislative and enforcement dynamics in major markets such as the US, including the progress of regulations related to “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and the implementation of the stablecoin regulatory framework. Scale and continuity of institutional fund inflows into the crypto market : Especially data on Bitcoin spot ETFs and actual allocations of sovereign and state-level reserves. Specific implementation of Trump’s tax cut policy : Including its impact path on fiscal deficit, debt ceiling, and market liquidity. Development and innovation of the stablecoin market : Including clarification of the regulatory framework, evolution of yield products, and changes in institutional participation. In summary, the Bitcoin market in 2025 will trudge forward in the fog of macroeconomics and the game of multiple policies. Investors need to maintain a high degree of vigilance and flexibility, deeply research market fundamentals, rationally evaluate risks, and make prudent investment decisions. Finding certainty in uncertainty will be the key to investing in Bitcoin in the coming period. At the same time, stablecoin financial management strategies also provide investors with an effective way to obtain stable returns amid market volatility, which deserves appropriate weight in asset allocation.

2025-05-28T04:17:08.000Z,"Analysis: Bitcoin long-term holders hold firm despite 47% rally from recent lows","Bitcoin has surged more than 47% from its recent lows, hitting a new all-time high in May as holding patterns show strong accumulation. Unlike in past market cycles, long-term holders are not in a hurry to sell. On-chain data reveals a notable lack of aggressive selling despite substantial profit potential, indicating strong conviction among long-term investors and little structural drag on the uptrend. Real Vision analyst Jamie Coutts stated in a May 28 X post that the LTH-SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) indicator is one of the most obvious indicators of this resilience. Although this metric peaked at 17 in 2017, 8 in 2021, and 4.3 in early 2024, it is currently only at 2.1. While MVRV and NUPL measure the potential for profit-taking, LTH-SOPR captures when that potential is realized—when long-term holders actually move coins to lock in gains or cut losses. At previous tops, the signal has been clear: LTH-SOPR hit 17 in 2017, 8 in 2021, and 4.3 in… pic.twitter.com/KM5ENDNHa6 — Jamie Coutts CMT (@Jamie1Coutts) May 28, 2025 This shows that LTHs are realizing fewer profits than they did during previous bull runs, even with Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) recent surge. Although there will inevitably be some re-distribution in response to rising prices, Coutts stressed that the current muted activity indicates long-term confidence is still strong. You might also like: Bitcoin faces key support test at $108k amid $211m in liquidations: analysts This view is supported by Glassnode data . Accumulation patterns can be seen in almost every wallet type. Alongside larger cohorts such as those with 100–1,000 BTC and 1,000–10,000 BTC, wallets with less than 1 BTC have also returned to accumulation mode. The only group that still exhibits net selling behavior is the 1–10 BTC group. Further, profit-taking during Bitcoin’s latest breakout has been surprisingly restrained. Glassnode noted that when BTC surpassed $100,000 last December, realized profit volumes exceeded $2.1 billion. In contrast, the most recent rally to a new high saw just $1 billion in realized profits, despite higher prices. When $BTC hit all-time high yesterday, total profit-taking volume was around $1.00B – less than half the amount realized when #Bitcoin first crossed $100K last December, which hit $2.10B. Despite a higher price, profit realization was far more muted. pic.twitter.com/GtZXU23yO9 — glassnode (@glassnode) May 22, 2025 Additionally, coin age data demonstrates that older coins are still mostly inactive. Just 13.4% of active supply is older than six months as of May 2025, down from 24.7% in December 2024. This decline indicates that while newer participants provide short-term momentum, older holders are likely sitting tight. The bullish outlook is supported by institutional interest. Over $5.3 billion has been invested in spot Bitcoin ETFs in the last month, as per SoSoValue data , and U.S.-listed funds currently oversee over $40 billion in total assets. Meanwhile, corporate accumulation keeps growing. Last week, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) increased its holdings to 576,230 BTC by purchasing an additional 7,390 BTC. The Japanese company Metaplanet has also boosted its holdings to more than 7, 000 BTC. Over 30,000 BTC is now being acquired each month by public companies collectively.

2025-05-28T04:00:33.000Z,"Bitcoin Miners Earning $50 Million Daily, How Does It Compare Historically?","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin miners are currently making more than $50 million in daily revenue. Here’s whether this is near the record or not. Bitcoin Miner Revenue Has Seen A Surge Recently In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has talked about the latest trend in the revenue of the Bitcoin miners. Miners on the BTC network earn their income through two means: block subsidy and transaction fees . The first of these, the block subsidy, refers to the reward that these chain validators receive as compensation for adding a block to the chain. This reward is given out as a fixed BTC amount and the rate at which the miners are able to receive it is also more or less fixed. As such, the only variable related to it is the asset’s price itself. The other component of the miner revenue, the transaction fees, is the payment that miners receive from each individual sender on the network. Users attach this amount when they are sending out a transaction on the blockchain. The total transaction fees that miners receive on any given day vary according to the amount of activity present on the chain. When the mempool is congested, users who want their transfers to go through as soon as possible have no choice but to pay an above-average fee to provide an incentive for the validators to prioritize them. As many senders compete against each other in this manner, the transaction fees can witness a spike. Most of the time, transfer activity doesn’t get too high on the Bitcoin network, so the miners end up relying on the block subsidy to make the majority of their revenue. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the combined revenue of the BTC miners over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin miner revenue saw a decline earlier in the year, a consequence of the downturn in the asset’s price that reduced the USD value of the block subsidy. Investors tend to lose interest in periods of decline, so a drop in transfer fees could have also contributed to this revenue loss. Recently, as the cryptocurrency has seen a reignition of bullish momentum, miner revenue has also naturally bounced back. These chain validators are now earning around $51.6 million per day. While this income level is certainly not low, it’s still far off from the peaks above $80 million witnessed last year and in the 2021 bull run . “This indicates a high but not yet peak level of network activity: miners are already generating significant income, yet there’s still room to climb back to those previous highs,” notes Adler Jr. BTC Price Bitcoin is currently once more sitting on the doorstep of a new all-time high as its price is floating around $110,000.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-miners-earning-50-million-daily-compare/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Miner Revenue|Bitcoin Miners|bitcoin mining|btc|BTCUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-05-28T04:00:15.000Z,"Tether’s 2-Year, $5 Billion Investment Blitz Fuels US Companies: CEO","Tether, the issuer of the USDT stablecoin, has quietly funneled roughly $5 billion of its earnings into a mix of US businesses and government debt over the past two years. It’s putting money where its mouth is. According to CEO Paolo Ardoino, these moves are meant to show how tied the company is to the American economy, even as it dominates markets abroad. Related Reading: Investors Pour $2.75 Billion Into Bitcoin ETFs As Price Skyrockets Big Bets In Tech According to Ardoino, Tether invested $775 million in Rumble earlier this year, scooping up more than 103 million shares of Class A stock. The firm also put $200 million into BlackRock Neurotech in 2024 through Tether Evo, its venture arm. That move made Tether the majority owner of the brain‐interface startup. These aren’t small stakes. They’re big plays on what could be the next wave of tech growth in the US. In the last 2 years Tether Group reinvested almost 5 billion USD of its profits within the United States economy and into US based companies. Some examples: Rumble, Blackrock Neurotech, XXI and different Bitcoin mining ventures. (That’s on top of having more than 120 billion in… — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) May 26, 2025 Tether Gets Into Bitcoin Mining Based on reports, Tether has also built positions in several US‐based Bitcoin mining firms. It recently boosted its holding in Bitdeer to 21%, making it one of the top shareholders. On top of that, the company is routing hash power to the OCEAN pool, tying its crypto reserves even more directly to American mining operations. It’s a mix of finance and hardware. Treasury Holdings And US Debt According to filings, Tether holds more than $120 billion in US Treasury bills. That makes it the 19th‐largest holder of US debt, ahead of countries like Germany ($111 billion) and the United Arab Emirates ($104 billion). These Treasury bills back most of the USDT in circulation. In a way, Tether has become a major player in the bond market, with a clear interest in keeping US fiscal matters steady. Plans For A New Stablecoin Based on statements from Ardoino, Tether plans to launch a new dollar‐backed coin for the US market once federal rules are in place. While USDT will stay active in developing nations, a fresh token could meet upcoming US stablecoin laws. Related Reading: XRP ETF At 83% Approval Odds—Is The SEC Losing Grip?

Regulatory Headwinds Tether’s strategy isn’t without challenges. It faces calls for more transparency on its reserves and criticism over the use of USDT by bad actors. The company insists it works closely with law enforcement when criminal funds surface.

Trump Media and Technology Group Corp., which operates Truth Social, announced on Tuesday that it entered into subscription agreements with approximately 50 institutional investors to facilitate the Bitcoin purchase. The firm agreed to issue and sell approximately $1.5 billion in its common stock to the investors and $1 billion in 0.00% convertible senior secured notes. Devin Nunes, Trump Media’s chief executive and chairman, says the firm is adopting a Bitcoin treasury because it views BTC as an “apex instrument of financial freedom.” “Our first acquisition of a crown jewel asset, this investment will help defend our Company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions, which plague many Americans and US firms, and will create synergies for subscription payments, a utility token, and other planned transactions across Truth Social and Truth+. It’s a big step forward in the Company’s plans to evolve into a holding company by acquiring additional profit-generating, crown jewel assets consistent with America First principles.” BTC is trading at $109,395 at time of writing after hitting a new all-time high of $111,814 late last week.

2025-05-28T03:46:15.000Z,"These 5 Top Altcoins Are Like Bitcoin at $1, Stack Now","The post These 5 Top Altcoins Are Like Bitcoin at $1, Stack Now appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A crypto analyst has shared his outlook for altcoins in 2025, expecting a classic altcoin season where capital moves from Bitcoin into Ethereum and other altcoins. According to Kyle, while distractions like meme coins may affect the market, growing institutional investment is set to help the overall crypto space. SUI First top pick is Sui (SUI) — a project built by developers behind Facebook’s former Diem project. With advanced security features, a unique Move programming language, and a growing U.S. presence, Sui is seen as a safer yet high-potential altcoin. The analyst expects a possible 5x to 10x return in the next bull run, thanks to its innovative approach and expanding partnerships, including with tech giant Microsoft. Gunzilla Games (GUNZ) Next is Gunzilla Games, a Web3 gaming company. Co-produced by Hollywood director Neill Blomkamp (of District 9 and Elysium fame), the game runs on its own custom blockchain built for Web3 gaming, called GUNZ. The platform already records over 150,000 on-chain transactions daily in its beta stage. Despite this activity, the token’s market cap remains low at around $33 million. The analyst believes it’s undervalued and expects the token to surge as Web3 gaming narratives heat up, especially before investor token unlocks begin in 10 months. Mind Network (FHE) Next is Mind Network, a privacy-focused blockchain project specializing in fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) — a groundbreaking tech that allows encrypted data to be processed without being decrypted. This is crucial for secure on-chain financial activity, especially for high-frequency traders and institutions who need to keep their strategies private. The project has been designated as a Tier 1 partner in Chainlink’s Build Program, placing it among a select few projects essential to Chainlink’s infrastructure plans. Sitting at a market cap of just $26 million, the analyst considers it a high-beta play on Chainlink’s future adoption in traditional finance systems. Bluefin (BLUE) The fourth altcoin was Bluefin. It’s a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Sui blockchain. It works a lot like Hyperliquid, which is another popular DEX for trading futures and spot tokens. But while Hyperliquid has its own chain, Bluefin runs on Sui. This makes it faster and gives it some different benefits. Since it launched, it has done over $65 billion in trading volume. It recently added a spot trading option too. What’s interesting is that today, a competitor called Cetus got hacked, and all its liquidity was locked. Because of that, Bluefin’s token price jumped 25% as traders moved over. Worldcoin (WLD) The fifth altcoin mentioned was Worldcoin, created by Sam Altman, the head of OpenAI. It’s a crypto project that uses eye scans to confirm people’s identities, which raised a lot of privacy concerns at first. When it launched, only a small part of its tokens were available to trade, while the rest were locked up. This caused the price to drop at first, but now they’ve made changes to control how many tokens can be released at a time",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/uncategorized/these-5-top-altcoins-are-like-bitcoin-at-1-stack-now/,"ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|TRADING|SUI","Uncategorized|Altcoins|Crypto news",cryptocompare

The company announced the plan at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 27, where Block demonstrated the feature at the BTC Inc. merchandise store. Merchants will be able to accept Bitcoin ( BTC ) payments through existing Square hardware using the Lightning Network, Bitcoin’s faster, lower-cost layer-2 scaling network. “Merchants can choose to hold the Bitcoin, or auto-convert it to fiat in real-time,” Dorsey said on X. The company said it expects to start rolling out in the second half of 2025, reaching all eligible Square sellers by 2026, subject to regulatory approvals. The move builds on Square’s existing Bitcoin Conversions feature that allows merchants to automatically convert sales to BTC. For consumers, payment is as simple as scanning a QR code, with Square handling the technicalities behind the scenes and Lightning enabling near-instant settlement.

2025-05-28T03:04:21.000Z,"Bitcoin’s ‘aggressive leg higher’ in Q3 still up in the air: Analyst","Bitcoin’s recent all-time high of $111,970 has sparked optimism among crypto market participants, but whether that carries through into the third quarter of this year remains uncertain, analysts say. “The coming weeks will likely determine whether Bitcoinʼs latest breakout was a local high or the prelude to a more aggressive leg higher in Q3,” Bitfinex analysts said in a May 28 markets note. Consolidation or mild retracement may “be healthy” Bitcoin ( BTC ) reached new all-time highs of $111,970 on May 22 , however, Bitfinex analysts say a continued price increase alone won’t necessarily confirm the uptrend heading into the next quarter. “A period of consolidation or mild retracement would not only be healthy but also provide a more sustainable foundation for the next leg higher,” the analysts said. It isn’t unusual for Bitcoin to consolidate for an extended time after reaching all-time highs. After Bitcoin reached a high of $73,679 in March 2024, it swung within about a $20,000 range until Donald Trump was elected US president that November. The third quarter of the year has, on average, been Bitcoin’s worst-performing quarter since 2013, with an average return of just 6.03% over the past 11 years, according to CoinGlass data. The next worst quarter on average is Q2, which has historically posted a stronger average return of 27.25%. Q4 has been the best-performing quarter on average for Bitcoin since 2013. Source: CoinGlass The analysts said that Bitcoin had entered a “short-term range-bound phase,” with a significant amount of short-term holders — those holding Bitcoin for under 155 days — selling off their positions over the past 30 days. “With over $11.4 billion in short-term holder profits realized in the past month, the near-term supply overhang is expected — but so is structural demand. According to Bitbo data, the short-term holder realized price for Bitcoin was $95,781, while Bitcoin was trading at $108,929 at the time of publication. This represents an average profit of 13.72% for short-term holders. Related: Bitcoin profit taking lingers, but rally to $115K will liquidate $7B shorts Bitfinex’s analysts said that Bitcoin’s ETF “bid strength,” low volatility and Bitcoin’s spot premium all signal a maturing market “poised for eventual continuation once macro clarity improves.” The trading week ending May 23 saw around $2.75 billion flow into spot Bitcoin ETFs.

2025-05-28T03:00:43.000Z,"Bitcoin’s Calm Feels Dangerous—All Eyes On Vegas And June Reversal","Bitcoin hovers between $107,000 and $111,000, a deceptively narrow range that masks an options market bristling with tension. In a note to clients released today, Singapore-based QCP Capital argues that the lull is anything but benign. “Bitcoin’s reaction to last Friday’s macro developments was relatively restrained, even as equities rallied sharply,” the desk writes, pointing to “steady” institutional inflows into spot-BTC ETFs as the anchor keeping spot prices in check. Bitcoin Calm Before The Storm? The stability, however, has not bled into derivatives: “Front-end implied volatility held firm, with BTC consolidating in a tight range,” QCP observes, adding that traders are actively paying up for one- and two-week downside protection ahead of the Bitcoin Conference that opens in Las Vegas later today. Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters A Massive Week: Key Events To Watch QCP frames the three-day gathering—whose speaker roster includes US Vice President JD Vance, Strategy chairman Michael Saylor, and Donald Trump’s sons Eric and Donald Jr.—as the key near-term volatility catalyst. “The sustained elevation in near-term vols suggests that traders are positioning around headline risk,” the firm writes. Memories of last year’s Nashville conference linger: a keynote by US President Trump sent one-day implied volatility above 90 before collapsing, with spot BTC tumbling nearly 30 percent in forty-eight hours. “That episode continues to shape market memory,” QCP warns, even as it assigns a low probability to a repeat. The positioning data argue for caution all the same. Perpetual futures open interest has retreated in the past twenty-four hours, and funding rates have slid back toward neutral levels—signs, QCP says, of “a defensive tilt.” Retail voices that typically embrace leverage are dialing back risk as well. Popular trader James Wynn has publicly trimmed longs, echoing an uptick in demand for short-dated puts that QCP describes as “persistent.” ETF flows remain the counterweight to that defensiveness. US spot-Bitcoin products absorbed 7,869 BTC last Friday, the largest single-day haul since late April, according to Glassnode data. For the week ending 23 May, net inflows reached $2.75 billion, the second-strongest weekly print of the year. Those allocations, QCP argues, “offer underlying support,” but are not large enough to overwhelm options-driven short-term swings should headlines jolt sentiment. Rumors—since denied—that Trump Media is exploring a $3 billion crypto raise exemplify the hair-trigger backdrop. “Headline sensitivity is elevated,” QCP writes. In its base case, Bitcoin holds its current band until the Las Vegas speeches conclude, after which “front-end vols are expected to compress as risk premia fade.” Higher Until Early June? Not everyone agrees that the compression will come quickly. The pseudonymous macro-cycle analyst Astronomer (@astronomer_zero), whose FOMC-timing model correctly flagged Bitcoin’s March low and February high, remains emphatically long. “This is not a ‘top in June’ call,” he posts on X. “This is a call that we go higher from here, and I remain bullish. Big difference.” Related Reading: Massive Whale Activity Detected on Binance as Bitcoin Tests New Highs He argues that Bitcoin historically grinds upward until roughly ten calendar days before an FOMC meeting; the next one lands on 18 June. “Price likely keeps going higher until the 8th–18th of June,” he writes, adding that cyclical weekly timing “lines up” and that he is “looking for longs upon short-time-frame pullbacks.” Astronomer’s conviction rests on a broader twenty-four-week cycle that he dates from the October 2024 breakout. “We are only week six,” he notes, implying that the upside phase is barely half-way through. He concedes that “alts always lag behind BTC,” but argues that pressing the momentum trade now is critical: “Going with momentum as long as possible gets you in the right mindset before trying to short too early.” For the moment, spot prices stay eerily placid even as the options market prices a storm. Whether that storm strikes upward or downward may depend on a sound bite delivered from a Las Vegas stage or on a policy nuance telegraphed from the Marriner Eccles Building three weeks later. Until then, Bitcoin’s calm is precisely what makes veteran traders nervous—and why hedging desks are doing brisk business selling fear. At press time, BTC traded at $110,661.

2025-05-28T02:11:48.000Z,"Real-world assets could revitalize dying NFT lending market: DappRadar","Real-world assets linking up with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is one of a few key catalysts that could reignite the waning NFT lending sector, which is suffering from a collapse in volumes and user activity, says blockchain analytics platform DappRadar. Volumes in the NFT lending market, which allows NFT holders to take out a loan against their token, have dropped 97% from a peak of around $1 billion in January 2024 to $50 million in May, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a May 27 report. Gherghelas said for NFT lending to “move beyond survival mode,” it needs “new catalysts” to reignite the sector, such as real-world asset NFTs, like tokenized real estate or yield-bearing assets that could unlock more stable, trusted collateral sources. “So far, 2025 has not delivered a compelling reason for NFT lending to bounce back,” she said. “While the infrastructure is still here and the platforms remain active, activity has slowed across the board.” Borrower and leading activity have taken a big hit in the NFT lending sector. Source: DappRadar “For now, the sector seems to be in a holding pattern, waiting either for market recovery or a new use case to reignite interest.” Gherghelas added that other catalysts that could rekindle NFT lending were tools that make it easier for NFT holders to borrow against their tokens, and that protocols should create “smart infrastructure” such as undercollateralized loans, credit scores and artificial intelligence risk matching. The report adds that since January last year, borrower activity has declined by 90% and those willing to lend have shrunk by 78%. The average NFT loan size has also taken a hit from a peak of $22,000 in 2022 to $4,000 in May, a 71% year-over-year drop. Gherghelas said this shift “shows that either users are borrowing against lower-value assets or simply becoming more conservative with leverage.” NFT lending overall trading volume and market activity have dropped off from the all-time highs of past years. Source: DappRadar The average loan duration is also lower ; after hitting an average of roughly 40 days in 2023, it’s been down to 31 days and has held steady throughout 2024 and into 2025. Gherghelas said this could indicate that “loans are being taken more frequently but for shorter periods, perhaps a sign of more tactical liquidity plays.” NFT market downturn also hurts lending Part of the slowdown in NFT lending is connected to the overall NFT market decline, which has seen volumes drop 61% in the first quarter to $1.5 billion compared to $4.1 billion a year ago. “With collateral value collapsing, the lending activity naturally followed,” Gherghelas said. “There are a few exceptions that managed to hold or regain traction, but they’ve been outliers, not enough to lift the sector.” Related: AI decentralized apps are coming for the Web3 throne: DappRadar The protocol landscape has also narrowed, and the number of active NFT lending apps is limited, with only eight protocols holding any meaningful share. “The flip-for-liquidity model that worked during bull markets isn’t built for a quieter, more risk-averse environment. But that doesn’t mean NFT lending is finished; it’s simply shifting focus,” Gherghelas said. “Platforms are diversifying, use cases are shifting, and collateral preferences are changing. If the next wave builds on utility, culture, and better design, NFT lending might just find its second wind — one built to last.” Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-world-assets-revitalize-dying-nft-lending-dappradar?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING","",cryptocompare

2025-05-28T02:00:49.000Z,"Bitcoin Sees Massive 7,883 BTC Outflow From Coinbase – Are Institutions Loading Up?","As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade near its recent all-time high (ATH) of $111,980, activity on major crypto exchanges suggests that institutional investors may be strengthening their BTC holdings. Most notably, Coinbase – the leading US-based crypto exchange – recorded a net outflow of 7,883 BTC, raising speculation about renewed institutional demand and a potential continuation of the rally. Coinbase Sees 7,883 Bitcoin Outflow According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor burakkemeci, Coinbase experienced a daily outflow of 8,742 BTC on May 26. After accounting for BTC deposits, the net outflow stood at 7,883 BTC – marking the third-largest single-day BTC outflow from the exchange in the past month. For the uninitiated, daily BTC outflow refers to the total amount of Bitcoin withdrawn from an exchange within a day, while net outflow is the difference between BTC withdrawn and deposited – showing the actual net movement of funds. A positive net outflow means more BTC left the exchange than entered, often signaling accumulation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near ATH, But Long-Term Holders Aren’t Selling – More Upside Ahead? Historically, large BTC outflows from Coinbase are often followed by institutional announcements or spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows. Since all US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs – except Fidelity’s – source their BTC from Coinbase, the scale of this transaction suggests potential ETF involvement or a corporate acquisition. One likely candidate is Strategy, led by Michael Saylor. The company recently disclosed a purchase of 7,390 BTC, bringing its total holdings to 576,230 BTC. Saylor has also hinted at another large acquisition, although only time will tell whether the latest Coinbase outflows are connected to the firm. Supporting this institutional narrative is the Coinbase Premium Index, which has remained consistently positive over the past month. This metric reflects stronger buying pressure from US-based investors, often linked to institutional demand. The analyst concluded: These outflows reflect sustained demand from U.S.-based institutions. If this appetite continues, it may lay the groundwork for another leg up in Bitcoin’s price. Especially when fueled by ETF inflows, such moves can lead to sharp price breaks and new highs. New BTC ATH Soon? At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $109,589, just 1.9% below its all-time high. However, multiple on-chain and technical indicators suggest that BTC could soon break into uncharted territory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rebound Signals Healthier Bull Market Without Overheating, Analyst Says CryptoQuant contributor ibrahimcosar recently noted that Bitcoin may be targeting the $112,000 mark after forming a double bottom pattern on the hourly chart.

Moreover, on-chain metrics show that holders are not rushing to sell, even while sitting on significant unrealized gains, suggesting belief in further price appreciation.

2025-05-28T02:00:32.000Z,"How Does Bitcoin Investor Behavior Shape Trends? Glassnode Reveals","The on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has explained how Bitcoin investor behavior tends to reflect in price trend reversals and continuations. Glassnode Highlights Key Behavioral Patterns Behind Bitcoin Moves In a new thread on X, Glassnode has shared a new way to categorize Bitcoin investors based on their on-chain spending patterns. Under this indicator, called the Supply by Investor Behavior, there are five cohorts: Conviction Buyers, First Buyers, Momentum Buyers, Loss Sellers, and Profit Takers. First Buyers, Loss Sellers, and Profit Takers are pretty self-explanatory. Conviction Buyers refer to the investors who buy despite a decline in the cryptocurrency’s price, while Momentum Buyers refer to those who buy during uptrends. Related Reading: Bitcoin SLRV Ribbons Turn Green—What Happens Next? “The metric tracks the cumulative token supply held by each cohort over time,” notes the analytics firm in the chart’s description on its website. “To focus solely on investor behavior, we exclude exchanges and smart contracts.” Here is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in the indicator over Bitcoin’s history: To showcase how the behavior of these groups has an effect on the asset’s trajectory, the analytics firm has zoomed in on the data of two cohorts: Conviction Buyers and First Buyers. First, here is the chart specifically for the Bitcoin Conviction Buyers: From the graph, it’s visible that the BTC supply held by the Conviction Buyers generally observes a spike alongside inflection points in the cryptocurrency’s price. In particular, their supply tends to reach a peak coinciding with bear market lows. These investors also step in to buy dips during uptrends, helping stabilize pullbacks. “But conviction alone isn’t enough to spark a rally – that’s where First Buyers come in,” explains Glassnode. Below is a chart that highlights the role of the First Buyers. As displayed in the chart, demand from First Buyers went up alongside Bitcoin’s recovery out of the bear market, with a particularly sharp surge coinciding with the bull rally in Q1 2024. Related Reading: XRP Sees Wave Of Inflows: 70% Of Realized Cap Now New Money The supply of the First Buyers let off during the consolidation phase that followed this rally, but demand returned in the second half of the year, helping fuel the run beyond $100,000. The Bitcoin market downturn this year again accompanied a decline in the supply of the First Buyers, this time to a much stronger degree than last year’s drawdown. New capital inflows seem to have made a sharp return once more, however, as the metric’s value has switched to rapid growth, potentially explaining the rally to the new all-time high.

2025-05-28T01:50:04.000Z,"US Government Bitcoin: Senator Lummis Reveals Shocking Belief in Massive Holdings","BitcoinWorld US Government Bitcoin: Senator Lummis Reveals Shocking Belief in Massive Holdings Whispers and speculation around the extent of the US government Bitcoin holdings have long circulated within the crypto community. Now, a prominent voice from within the government itself has added significant weight to the discussion. At the recent Bitcoin 2025 conference, crypto-friendly U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis shared a remarkable belief: she estimates the U.S. government currently possesses approximately 200,000 Bitcoin (BTC). Senator Lummis Shares Insight on Bitcoin Holdings Senator Cynthia Lummis, known for her supportive stance on digital assets and blockchain technology, delivered this striking estimate during her appearance at the highly anticipated Bitcoin 2025 conference. The revelation, reported by Eleanor Terrett, host of Crypto in America, on X, immediately sent ripples through the crypto news landscape. While the number itself is substantial, the context provided by Senator Lummis is equally important. According to Terrett’s report, Senator Lummis is not entirely certain of the precise 200,000 figure. She indicated that the specific details regarding these significant Bitcoin holdings were classified following an audit conducted under the direction of the White House. The fact that such information is classified underscores the sensitive nature with which the government views its digital asset reserves. Senator Lummis did mention that she has been offered a private briefing on the matter, suggesting a level of transparency is available to her as a legislator, even if the full details remain shielded from the public eye. Her willingness to share her estimated figure, despite the classified nature, highlights the growing importance of discussing government involvement with cryptocurrencies openly, even within the bounds of national security. Why Does the US Government Hold Bitcoin? Understanding Government Crypto Acquisitions Many might wonder how the US government Bitcoin holdings accumulated in the first place. Unlike individual investors buying BTC on exchanges, the vast majority of the government’s cryptocurrency stash comes from seizures related to criminal activities. Federal agencies, such as the FBI, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), regularly confiscate cryptocurrencies used in illicit operations, including: Drug trafficking Money laundering Cybercrime (like ransomware attacks) Fraud schemes Perhaps the most famous example involves the Bitcoin seized from the Silk Road online marketplace, shut down by the FBI in 2013. Over the years, authorities have seized hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies from various illegal enterprises. These assets are then held in government wallets, pending legal proceedings or decisions on their disposition. Comparing Estimates: Is 200K BTC a New High for Government Crypto? Prior to Senator Lummis’s statement, public estimates of the Government crypto holdings derived primarily from reported seizures. While official, consolidated figures are hard to come by publicly, various reports have tracked known government confiscations over time. These reports have often placed the publicly acknowledged holdings in the range of tens of thousands or low hundreds of thousands of BTC, though exact figures fluctuate as assets are seized or occasionally sold. Senator Lummis’s belief in a 200,000 BTC holding is significant because it represents a high-end estimate from someone with potential access to more detailed, albeit classified, information. It suggests that the government’s total stash, combining all agencies and past seizures, could be considerably larger than what is commonly discussed based solely on public announcements. It’s crucial to remember that Lummis stated this as her ‘belief’ based on classified information, rather than a confirmed, declassified figure. The exact number could be slightly higher or lower, but the ballpark figure of 200,000 BTC positions the U.S. government as one of the largest single holders of Bitcoin globally, outside of potentially Satoshi Nakamoto’s presumed holdings and major exchanges or investment funds. The Classified Nature of US Government Bitcoin Holdings The fact that the specific details surrounding the US government Bitcoin audit and total holdings are classified raises important questions. Why the secrecy? Several potential reasons exist: Market Impact: Disclosing the exact amount could potentially influence the Bitcoin market, especially if the government were to signal an intent to sell a large portion. Keeping the precise figure confidential reduces the risk of market manipulation or volatility based on government actions. National Security: The methods used to track, seize, and secure these digital assets might involve sensitive law enforcement or intelligence techniques that the government wishes to keep secret from criminals and foreign adversaries. Ongoing Investigations: Revealing total holdings might inadvertently disclose information related to ongoing criminal investigations or asset recovery efforts. Strategic Asset Status: The government might view Bitcoin as a strategic asset, similar to gold reserves or foreign currency holdings, where full transparency is not always deemed necessary or beneficial. While classification might serve legitimate government interests, it also creates a lack of public transparency regarding significant public assets. This is a point of tension for advocates of open government and the transparent handling of seized assets. Senator Lummis: A Key Voice in Crypto Regulation Senator Cynthia Lummis’s comments are particularly noteworthy given her prominent role in advocating for clear and sensible Crypto regulation in the United States. As a co-sponsor of bipartisan legislation aimed at creating a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets, she has consistently called for greater clarity and certainty for the crypto industry. Her insights into the government’s substantial Bitcoin holdings highlight a paradox: the U.S. government is simultaneously a major holder of crypto assets and a key player in the ongoing debate about how to regulate them. This dual role adds complexity to the regulatory conversation. Does the government’s experience managing seized crypto assets inform its approach to regulating the broader market? How should the disposition of these assets (selling vs. holding) be decided, and what should be the criteria? Senator Lummis’s perspective, coming from someone who understands both the governmental machinery and the principles of digital assets, is invaluable in bridging the gap between Washington D.C. and the crypto ecosystem. Her willingness to speak about potentially classified information, even in broad terms, signals the importance she places on public awareness and discussion surrounding these topics. What Does This Mean for the Future? The revelation of a belief in 200,000 BTC Government crypto holdings, coupled with the classified audit, suggests a few things: The U.S. government is likely one of the largest single entities holding Bitcoin. The government is actively auditing and managing these digital assets, indicating a growing institutional acknowledgment of their value (and potential risks). Transparency around government crypto holdings is limited, raising questions about public oversight and potential market impact if these assets were ever liquidated. Legislators like Senator Lummis are pushing for more understanding and potentially more transparency regarding these holdings and their implications for policy. The disposition of seized crypto assets remains a point of interest. While the government has sold off portions of its seized Bitcoin in the past, holding a significant reserve could also be viewed strategically. It could be seen as a hedge, a potential source of funds, or even leverage in future financial or geopolitical contexts. Conclusion: The Classified Cache of US Government Bitcoin Senator Cynthia Lummis’s statement at Bitcoin 2025 provides a compelling glimpse into the opaque world of US government Bitcoin holdings. Her belief that the government holds around 200,000 BTC, a figure tied to a classified White House audit, confirms that the U.S. government is a major, albeit secretive, player in the Bitcoin market. This significant holding, primarily accumulated through law enforcement seizures, raises critical questions about transparency, market impact, and the government’s evolving strategy towards digital assets. As discussions around Crypto regulation continue to evolve, the government’s own substantial Government crypto reserves will undoubtedly remain a topic of interest and debate. Senator Lummis’s willingness to bring this estimated figure into the public discourse, despite its classified origins, underscores the growing need for clarity regarding how these assets are managed and what their existence signifies for the future of Bitcoin and the broader digital economy.

2025-05-28T01:40:07.000Z,"AI’s Startling Impact on Entry Level Tech Jobs Revealed","BitcoinWorld AI’s Startling Impact on Entry Level Tech Jobs Revealed In the rapidly evolving world of technology and cryptocurrency, discussions around the AI impact on jobs are becoming increasingly relevant. While many have debated when and if artificial intelligence would begin displacing human workers, new data suggests we might be seeing the initial effects, particularly concerning entry level tech jobs . Are Entry Level Tech Jobs Disappearing Due to AI? Recent research indicates a potential shift in tech hiring trends that could be linked to the rise of AI. SignalFire, a venture capital firm that tracks job movements across millions of employees and companies using LinkedIn data, has observed a notable change in how tech companies are recruiting. Their analysis for 2024 shows a decrease in the hiring of recent college graduates compared to 2023. Simultaneously, these same companies, especially the top 15 big tech firms, have increased their recruitment of experienced professionals. Specifically: Big tech companies reduced new graduate hiring by 25% in 2024 compared to 2023. Startups saw an 11% decrease in graduate recruitment year-over-year. While other factors could contribute to this dip, SignalFire’s head of research, Asher Bantock, believes there is significant evidence suggesting AI is a major factor. The World Economic Forum also supports this, with a survey indicating 40% of employers plan to cut staff where AI can automate tasks. Why AI Automation Targets Junior Roles Why are entry level tech jobs particularly susceptible to AI automation ? These roles often involve tasks that are routine, repetitive, and lower-risk. Generative AI is becoming increasingly capable of handling such duties. Examples include: Basic coding and debugging Preliminary financial research and analysis Software installation and basic support AI’s ability to perform these tasks means companies may require fewer human employees for entry-level positions. Gabe Stengel, founder of AI financial analyst startup Rogo, shared his experience. His company’s AI tool can automate much of the analysis work he did early in his investment banking career, such as diligence, financial review, and material preparation. Major investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have reportedly considered reducing junior staff hires significantly and adjusting pay, acknowledging that AI makes some tasks less demanding than before. The Growing Need for Experience Amidst Changing Tech Hiring Trends Despite the potential challenges for new graduates, the demand for experienced tech professionals is rising. SignalFire’s report highlights this trend: Big tech companies increased hiring by 27% for professionals with two to five years of experience. Startups hired 14% more individuals in the same seniority range. This creates a challenging situation for recent graduates: they need experience to get hired, but cannot gain experience without being hired. Heather Doshay, SignalFire’s people and talent partner, notes that AI exacerbates this long-standing paradox. Navigating the Future of Tech Jobs As we look at the future of tech jobs , adapting to AI is crucial. The advice for those entering the field is clear: master AI tools. As Doshay puts it, “AI won’t take your job if you’re the one who’s best at using it.” Developing proficiency in AI-powered platforms and understanding how to leverage them for complex tasks will be essential for career growth. Understanding the impact of AI is vital for anyone in the tech sector, including those interested in cryptocurrency and blockchain, where AI applications are also expanding. Staying informed on these developments is key to navigating the evolving landscape. Join us at Bitcoin World Sessions: AI to delve deeper into the convergence of AI and technology.

2025-05-28T01:33:04.000Z,"Asia Morning Briefing: Bitcoin Becomes ‘Generational Asset’ as Speculators Ditch Rolexes","Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Ethereum surged past $2,600 in early Asia hours, up 3.7%, breaking decisively above its previous resistance level of around $2,500 following a prolonged consolidation period, according to CoinDesk Research's AI-assisted technical analysis model. The rally is supported by robust trading volume and significant institutional confidence, underscored by $248 million in net inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs last week, led prominently by BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust. DeFi activity is also strengthening, with Ethereum's total value locked (TVL) rising 3.59% over the last 24 hours to $64.37 billion, according to DeFi Llama. However, the rally faces potential headwinds. Ethereum’s active addresses currently sit at 406,180, nearly flat compared to approximately 430,000 addresses one year ago, indicating muted user growth. Additionally, stablecoin flows reveal mixed signals; traditional stalwarts USDT and USDC remain relatively flat, while emerging stablecoins such as Ethena's USDe and BUIDL demonstrate stronger growth trends, signaling shifts within Ethereum’s broader stablecoin ecosystem. Despite bullish momentum and strong institutional backing, subdued retail investor participation and tepid user growth suggest this rally could face near-term constraints. Bitcoin Soars While Luxury Watches Stall: A Pandemic-Era Correlation Breaks Down Bitcoin (BTC) and luxury watches, once pandemic-era companions buoyed by stimulus and speculative exuberance, have sharply diverged over the past year, market data shows, with BTC surging 56.9%, according to CoinDesk market data , while WatchCharts.com luxury watch index fell by 4%. As recently as mid-2023, prices for bitcoin and luxury watches moved closely in tandem, buoyed by central banks and governments injecting substantial liquidity into global markets. However, the two have since taken distinctly different paths. OKX Global Chief Commercial Officer Lennix Lai attributes Bitcoin’s sustained upward trajectory to increased institutional adoption and maturation as a credible asset. In contrast, the secondary market for luxury watches has cooled significantly from its pandemic peak. “The real collectors stayed in watches while speculators moved on, and bitcoin has matured to take its place in many investors’ portfolios,” Lai said. “Watches make great heirlooms, but I'll take Bitcoin any day as a generational asset. You can't lose it, scratch it during a move, or have it stolen, as long as you keep your seed phrase secure.” Yet, in recent months, the luxury watch market has shown early signs of a modest recovery, posting a 0.3% gain over the last three months. Jake Plonskier, founder of Watches.io, credits this rebound to external economic pressures rather than renewed crypto-driven speculation. He notes rising tariffs and surging gold prices as key catalysts. “Gold and silver are decent proxies for the watch market,” Plonskier explained, highlighting Rolex’s January decision to raise MSRP by 14% for its gold models. He added that crypto's lasting impact on luxury watches is primarily demographic: \""Crypto wealth introduced a whole new market that can afford watches. Now men under 30 can afford Pateks and APs, which traditionally never would have been purchased by this type of clientele.” Circle Prepares for IPO Filing Circle Internet Group, the issuer of stablecoin USDC, has filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker \""CRCL,\"" aiming to sell 24 million class A shares priced between $24 and $26 each, CoinDesk previously reported. The company itself will offer 9.6 million shares, potentially raising nearly $250 million, while selling stakeholders are providing an additional 14.4 million shares, possibly earning close to $375 million. Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment has indicated interest in purchasing $150 million worth of shares during the IPO, which is being managed by joint lead active bookrunners J.P. Morgan, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs. The IPO filing follows previous unsuccessful attempts, including a failed SPAC deal in 2021 and a brief consideration of a $5 billion sale to firms such as Coinbase or Ripple. Marathon Digital CEO Says U.S. Government Should Mine BTC Marathon Digital CEO Fred Thiel urged the U.S. government to start actively mining bitcoin to fulfill President Trump's directive for a strategic bitcoin reserve, suggesting excess hydroelectricity could support domestic mining operations, CoinDesk previously reported. Speaking at Bitcoin 2025, Thiel emphasized the necessity of tangible steps beyond the current plan of using approximately 200,000 seized bitcoins from government forfeitures. Senator Cynthia Lummis supports this broader vision through her proposed BITCOIN Act, advocating for converting underperforming government gold certificates into bitcoin to expand the reserve substantially. However, Lummis acknowledges significant legislative hurdles remain, citing a general lack of congressional understanding about bitcoin and competing priorities such as stablecoin and market structure regulations. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin bounced back strongly from a correction to $107,604, stabilizing just below key resistance at $110,000, supported by easing EU trade tensions and continued accumulation from long-term investors, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. ETH: Ethereum broke decisively above $2,600 on strong institutional ETF inflows and rising DeFi activity, though flat active address growth could limit further upside. Gold: Gold currently trades at $3,315.30 per ounce, down 0.77%, as Citi upgrades its near-term forecast to between $3,100 and $3,500 due to ongoing trade uncertainties, while remaining cautious longer term amid expectations of economic improvement and Fed rate cuts. Nikkei 225: Japan's Nikkei 225, which opened at 38,003.67 on Wednesday, is forecasted to rise approximately 5% to 39,600 by year-end, according to a Reuters poll , as U.S. trade uncertainties eased, though near-term volatility remained likely, with analysts predicting further gains to 42,000 by the end of 2026. S&P 500: The benchmark S&P 500 closed about 2.1% higher Tuesday, boosted by optimism over a delayed implementation of U.S.-EU tariffs and improved prospects for a trade agreement.

2025-05-28T01:30:09.000Z,"Bitcoin: Historic Shift? Donald Trump Backs Bitcoin Act, US 1M BTC Bill Advances","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Historic Shift? Donald Trump Backs Bitcoin Act, US 1M BTC Bill Advances Big news is stirring in the world of cryptocurrency and US politics! According to reports originating from Walter Bloomberg on X, Senator Cynthia Lummis made a significant announcement at the recent Bitcoin 2025 Conference. She stated that former U.S. President Donald Trump supports the proposed Bitcoin Act . This revelation comes as a separate, equally intriguing development unfolds: a bill proposing the U.S. government purchase a staggering 1 million BTC is reportedly heading to the Senate floor next week. These intertwined events signal a potentially pivotal moment for Bitcoin and its place within the United States’ financial and strategic landscape. Understanding the Potential Impact of Donald Trump’s Stance on Bitcoin The statement from Senator Lummis regarding Donald Trump’s support for the Bitcoin Act is particularly noteworthy given his past cautious, and at times critical, comments on cryptocurrencies. While he has previously expressed skepticism about cryptos competing with the dollar, his alleged support for specific Bitcoin legislation suggests an evolving perspective or a strategic alignment with a growing segment of the electorate interested in digital assets. Trump’s influence, especially within the Republican party, is undeniable. An endorsement from a figure of his stature could lend significant political weight to pro-Bitcoin initiatives in Congress. What might this support mean in practical terms? It could potentially: Encourage more Republican lawmakers to openly support Bitcoin-friendly legislation. Signal to regulators a potential shift in executive branch attitude towards the asset class, should he return to office. Boost mainstream confidence in Bitcoin by associating it with a major political figure. However, it’s also important to consider the political dynamics. Endorsements can be complex, and the depth of this ‘support’ for the Bitcoin Act would need to be scrutinized as more details emerge. Political backing is a crucial element in navigating the complex path of Crypto Policy in Washington. Exploring the Ambitious US Bitcoin Bill: Why Buy 1 Million BTC? Parallel to the news about Trump’s support, reports indicate a distinct bill proposing the purchase of 1 million BTC is slated to reach the Senate floor. This proposal is ambitious, to say the least. 1 million Bitcoin represents a substantial portion of the total supply (currently just under 21 million) and, at current market prices, would involve an enormous expenditure, potentially hundreds of billions of dollars. Why would the U.S. government consider such a move? Several potential rationales could be behind this proposed US Bitcoin Bill : Strategic Reserve: Treating Bitcoin as a strategic asset, similar to gold or oil reserves, to diversify the national balance sheet. Hedge Against Inflation: Acquiring Bitcoin as a potential hedge against the devaluation of the U.S. dollar or other fiat currencies. Asserting Leadership: Positioning the U.S. as a leader in the future of digital finance and technology. Attracting Talent and Innovation: Signaling a commitment to the crypto industry, potentially encouraging businesses and innovators to remain or establish themselves in the U.S. Such a purchase would be unprecedented for a major global power. It would likely have significant implications for the global financial system and the perception of Bitcoin as a legitimate, state-level asset. Senator Lummis: A Steadfast Voice for Bitcoin in Washington Senator Lummis of Wyoming has consistently been one of the most vocal and knowledgeable advocates for Bitcoin and digital assets in the U.S. Senate. Her background, which includes owning Bitcoin herself, lends her credibility within the crypto community. She has been instrumental in trying to shape constructive Crypto Policy rather than purely restrictive regulation. The ‘Bitcoin Act’ she mentioned, while details are still emerging, is likely aligned with her known legislative priorities. These priorities typically include: Providing regulatory clarity for digital assets, distinguishing between commodities, securities, and other asset types. Protecting individuals’ right to self-custody their digital assets. Ensuring that innovation in the crypto space can thrive in the U.S. under clear rules. Integrating digital assets into the existing financial framework where appropriate, without stifling their unique properties. Her efforts, often in collaboration with other pro-crypto lawmakers like Senator Gillibrand on broader regulatory frameworks, highlight the growing bipartisan interest in understanding and legislating for the digital asset space. Her statement at the Bitcoin 2025 conference underscores the ongoing dialogue between policymakers and the crypto industry. Navigating the Complex Terrain of US Crypto Policy The landscape of Crypto Policy in the United States is complex and constantly evolving. Various government agencies – including the SEC, CFTC, Treasury, and the Federal Reserve – have overlapping jurisdictions and differing views on how digital assets should be regulated. Congress has seen multiple bills introduced, but comprehensive legislation has been slow to pass. The potential advancement of a US Bitcoin Bill and the reported support from Donald Trump introduce new variables into this equation. It suggests that political will might be strengthening for specific, potentially bold, actions related to Bitcoin . However, significant hurdles remain: Political Opposition: Not all lawmakers are favorable towards Bitcoin or see a role for the government in holding it. Concerns about volatility, illicit use, and environmental impact are often raised. Regulatory Uncertainty: Even if a bill passes, the specific agencies tasked with implementation would need clear directives, which can be subject to interpretation and delay. Logistical Challenges: Acquiring 1 million BTC would require careful execution to avoid massive market disruption. Public Debate: A move of this magnitude would spark widespread public and economic debate about its wisdom and implications. The coming weeks, particularly as the reported 1M BTC bill potentially reaches the floor, will be critical in understanding the seriousness and potential path forward for these initiatives. What This Means for Bitcoin and the Market News of potential state-level adoption or significant government interaction with Bitcoin is typically viewed positively by the market. It can increase legitimacy, signal long-term viability, and potentially create significant demand. If a US Bitcoin Bill proposing the purchase of 1 million BTC were to pass and be enacted, the direct market impact would be substantial. The mechanics of such a purchase (e.g., over what timeframe, through which entities) would dictate the immediate price reaction, but the long-term removal of such a large amount of Bitcoin from the circulating supply could be profoundly bullish. Beyond the direct purchase, the symbolic impact of the U.S. government holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset could influence other nations and institutions, potentially accelerating global adoption and integration into traditional finance. However, it’s crucial to approach these developments with cautious optimism. Legislative processes are lengthy and uncertain. Bills can be amended, delayed, or fail. The current news, while exciting, is based on reports of statements and upcoming legislative steps, not finalized law. Actionable Insights: What to Watch For For those interested in the intersection of politics and crypto, these developments are compelling. Here are a few things to keep an eye on: Details of the ‘Bitcoin Act’: What specific provisions does it contain? How does it aim to shape Crypto Policy ? Progress of the 1 Million BTC Bill: Does it reach the floor? What is the debate surrounding it? Who are its key sponsors and opponents? Further Clarification from Donald Trump: Will he publicly confirm or elaborate on his support for the Bitcoin Act ? Market Reaction: How does the price of Bitcoin react to the news and subsequent legislative updates? Statements from Other Policymakers: Do other senators or representatives voice support or opposition to these initiatives? Staying informed through reliable news sources and tracking legislative progress will be key to understanding how these potential developments might unfold and impact the future of Bitcoin . Summary: A Momentous Juncture for Bitcoin in the USA The confluence of Senator Lummis’s report on Donald Trump’s support for the Bitcoin Act and the potential movement of a US Bitcoin Bill proposing a 1 million BTC purchase represents a potentially momentous period for cryptocurrency in the United States. While the path forward for any legislation is always uncertain, these developments highlight the increasing relevance of Bitcoin in political discourse and its growing consideration as a strategic asset at the highest levels. The coming weeks could provide clearer signals on the future direction of Crypto Policy and the potential for unprecedented government interaction with the world’s leading digital asset.

2025-05-28T01:24:34.000Z,"Hedge fund trader bets on Bitcoin ETF via Bitwise","Josh Mandell, a Wall Street Trader known for his high-quality work in government bonds and leading hedge funds, has surprised many by risking $2.1 million on Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB). Famous for a cautious, calculated style honed over decades in traditional finance, Mandell’s new position reflects a deeper contrast in how old-school investors look at digital assets. Mandell shared a screenshot on X showing his large position of 35,000 BITB shares, bought at an average price of $59.98. At press time, BITB had ticked up to $60.02, netting him a small but notable gain of $1,491.80. His post on X read, “I’ve made some bad choices when deciding how to invest in Bitcoin, but today I’m a Bitwiser.” Mandell and other Wall Street vets invest in Bitcoin Mandell’s move into Bitcoin is no small sign. He has managed billions of dollars at several leading hedge funds , including Caxton Associates, where he was Director and Head of Fixed Income Trading. Mandell, who boasts more than two decades of experience in navigating the turbulence of the markets, isn’t one to chase trends or make public investment declarations lightly. His public support for a financial instrument tied to Bitcoin is also a striking reversal. Not long ago, many in his circles considered crypto assets too dangerous or unregulated for serious portfolios. That reality seems to be changing — driven partly by more familiar investment vehicles like ETFs. Mandell’s involvement indicates the increasing acceptance of BTC as a legitimate store of value and hedge against macroeconomic risk. It’s a subtle but strong vote favoring Bitcoin’s role in the financial mainstream. The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, created to ideally cater to those who want exposure to crypto markets without dealing with digital wallets and private keys, has quickly become a favorite product. Unlike traditional investments in crypto, ETFs such as BITB trade on well-known stock exchanges, and their transactions are governed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. This regulatory clarity appeals to cautious investors. Since launching earlier this year, BITB has been one of the most traded Bitcoin ETFs, with over $4B in assets under management at the end of May. Bitwise ETF attracts investors as demand surges Beyond offering regulated crypto exposure, Bitwise has pledged some ETF proceeds to support open-source Bitcoin development . It has also bolstered the company’s credibility among the crypto-native crowd and drew in ESG-conscious institutional investors. Mandell’s entry into the ETF may sound like another portfolio update. But for many observers, it’s far bigger than that — validating BTC as an asset class worthy of consideration in institutional portfolios. Crypto and legacy finance are converging at warp speed. As regulatory uncertainty declines and Bitcoin becomes more accessible with financial instruments like ETFs, it’s no longer just a digital punchline passed around in tech-savvy circles. Instead, it’s becoming a core part of global investment strategies. Now, retail investors have another clear example of a respected Wall Street figure who is entering the crypto space disciplined and transparently. For many, Mandell’s move signals that Bitcoin has secured its place—not just as a speculative gamble but as a legitimate part of long-term asset allocation.

2025-05-28T01:10:15.000Z,"KindlyMD Bitcoin Adoption: Strategic Purchase Ahead of Nakamoto Merger","BitcoinWorld KindlyMD Bitcoin Adoption: Strategic Purchase Ahead of Nakamoto Merger In a move that highlights the accelerating trend of companies integrating digital assets into their financial strategies, healthcare and data company KindlyMD recently made a significant KindlyMD Bitcoin purchase. This acquisition comes as the company prepares for a notable merger, positioning itself firmly within the evolving landscape where traditional industries intersect with the world of cryptocurrency. What’s Behind KindlyMD’s Bitcoin Strategy? KindlyMD, primarily known for its work in the healthcare and data sectors, has signaled a clear strategic shift by adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet. This isn’t a sudden decision, but rather a planned initiative. The company had previously announced its intention to establish a Bitcoin reserve fund, indicating a long-term view on the cryptocurrency as part of its financial architecture. Why would a healthcare and data company venture into the volatile world of Bitcoin? Several factors likely play a role: Store of Value: Like many corporations exploring Bitcoin, KindlyMD may view BTC as a potential hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, seeking a non-sovereign store of value in an uncertain economic climate. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin can diversify the company’s treasury assets beyond traditional cash and equivalents. Alignment with Future Plans: As we’ll discuss, this move is intrinsically linked to KindlyMD’s upcoming merger, suggesting Bitcoin will play a central role in the combined entity’s operations or strategy. Innovation and Future-Proofing: Embracing digital assets can position a company as forward-thinking and adaptable in a rapidly changing technological and financial world. This strategic pivot underscores a growing confidence among diverse companies regarding Bitcoin’s role not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate component of corporate finance. Why Corporate Bitcoin Adoption is Gaining Traction KindlyMD’s move is part of a broader trend. Over the past few years, Corporate Bitcoin Adoption has moved from a fringe idea to a notable financial strategy for businesses across various sectors. Companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Block (formerly Square) were early pioneers, holding substantial amounts of BTC on their balance sheets. The motivations often cited by these companies include: Macroeconomic Hedge: Protection against potential inflation driven by quantitative easing and fiscal stimulus. Digital Gold Narrative: Bitcoin’s perceived scarcity (capped supply of 21 million coins) and decentralized nature drawing comparisons to gold. Potential for Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term growth potential. Attracting Talent and Investors: Aligning with the growing interest in cryptocurrencies can appeal to a certain demographic of employees and investors. While the trend faces challenges like price volatility and regulatory uncertainty, the increasing number of companies, now including a Healthcare Company Bitcoin holder like KindlyMD, exploring or adopting this strategy suggests it’s becoming a more mainstream consideration for treasury management. Understanding the KindlyMD Nakamoto Merger The timing of KindlyMD’s Bitcoin purchase is particularly interesting when viewed alongside its planned merger with Nakamoto. Nakamoto is described as a Bitcoin investment firm. This planned union suggests a powerful synergy: KindlyMD’s expertise in healthcare and data combined with Nakamoto’s specialization in Bitcoin and potentially other digital asset investments. The Nakamoto Merger is expected to be finalized in the third quarter of this year. While specific details about the post-merger entity’s structure and strategic focus are anticipated, the pre-merger Bitcoin acquisition by KindlyMD strongly implies that digital assets, and specifically Bitcoin, will be a core component of the combined company’s strategy. This could involve: Managing a larger, combined Bitcoin treasury. Developing services or products that leverage both healthcare data and blockchain/Bitcoin technology. Offering Bitcoin-related investment or treasury management services to other companies. The merger represents a fascinating convergence of a traditional data-rich industry (healthcare) with the cutting-edge world of digital asset investment, potentially paving the way for new business models and applications. Details of the Recent BTC Purchase According to reports, KindlyMD’s recent acquisition involved the purchase of 21 Bitcoin. The average price paid per Bitcoin was reported to be $109,027. This BTC Purchase price is notably above Bitcoin’s historical trading range, reflecting the specific market conditions at the time of the acquisition. It’s important to understand what this means: Specific Timing: The purchase occurred at a point where Bitcoin’s price was trading significantly higher than its average over its lifetime. This could be influenced by market sentiment, institutional demand, or other factors specific to the purchase date. Average Price: The figure $109,027 represents the average cost across the 21 BTC acquired. This implies the purchase might have occurred over a short period, potentially in chunks, as KindlyMD executed its strategy. Size of Purchase: While 21 BTC might seem like a specific number, its value is substantial at that average price point (over $2.2 million). This indicates a serious commitment to their announced Bitcoin reserve strategy. This purchase solidifies KindlyMD’s balance sheet commitment to Bitcoin ahead of the anticipated merger, signaling confidence in the asset’s future value and its role within the combined company’s strategy. Implications for Healthcare Company Bitcoin Holders and Beyond The fact that a Healthcare Company Bitcoin is now on the list of corporate holders adds another layer to the narrative of mainstream adoption. While the primary business of KindlyMD is healthcare and data, this financial decision could have broader implications: Setting a Precedent: Could this encourage other companies in the healthcare or data-heavy sectors to explore similar treasury strategies? Integration Potential: The merger with Nakamoto hints at potential integrations of Bitcoin or blockchain technology within healthcare data management, security, or patient incentives, although details remain to be seen. Increased Institutional Interest: Every new company adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet contributes to the overall narrative of institutional acceptance, potentially attracting further investment and stability to the market. For readers interested in this trend, it highlights the importance of watching company financial reports and announcements for insights into how diverse industries are beginning to interact with digital assets. It also underscores the need to understand the risks associated with holding volatile assets like Bitcoin. Summary: A Strategic Move for KindlyMD KindlyMD’s purchase of 21 Bitcoin at an average price of $109,027 is a significant development, reinforcing the trend of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption . This move is strategically timed ahead of its planned Nakamoto Merger in Q3 2024. By establishing a KindlyMD Bitcoin reserve fund and executing this specific BTC Purchase , the company signals its commitment to integrating digital assets into its core financial strategy, potentially setting a precedent for other firms, including those classified as a Healthcare Company Bitcoin holder. The merger with a Bitcoin investment firm like Nakamoto further solidifies this direction, promising an interesting future at the intersection of healthcare data and digital finance.

2025-05-28T01:08:06.000Z,"Donald Trump Jr. Says Getting ‘Debanked, De-Insured, De-Everything’ Orange-Pilled Him","LAS VEGAS, Nevada — Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of U.S. President Donald Trump, said he and his younger brother Eric Trump “orange-pilled” their father after the family and its organization experienced pervasive de-banking in the wake of Trump’s first presidential term. Speaking at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas on Tuesday, Don Jr. said he wasn’t an early adopter of bitcoin or crypto, only finding his way to blockchain technology after realizing the “fragile” nature of the traditional financial system. “We were real estate guys, we were hard assets, we built buildings — [bitcoin] was a bit nebulous,” he said during a fireside chat with Rumble CEO and founder Chris Pavlovski. “But once we got into that political sector…we were getting de-banked, we were getting de-insured, we were getting de-everything. It was brutal.” Don Jr. said he and Eric “definitely” had a hand in helping their father, who called bitcoin a scam in 2021, understand the potential of crypto and blockchain technology. “We were the ones who were getting subpoenaed in nonsense lawsuits, we were the ones who are dealing with getting de-banked … we’re the guys who probably saw that first-hand,” he said of him and his brother. “We probably, maybe got there a little bit before him. Once we started explaining the potential, he’s a quick study … he got there pretty quickly.” Once Trump embraced crypto on the campaign trail, Don Jr. said he got a laugh out of other candidates, including Democratic nominee and former Vice President Kamala Harris, jumping on the bitcoin bandwagon. “I would pay money, a lot of money, maybe my entire crypto wallet, to have Kamala Harris explain blockchain technology,” Don Jr. said. “That would be the greatest word salad in the history of Kamala Harris word salad.” Don Jr. added that his father “cares about doing what’s right for America,” saying the democratization of finance “is a fundamental tenant after, like, world peace, of what he wants to accomplish in this administration.” The Trump family’s crypto ventures, including the TRUMP memecoin and World Liberty Financial, have been heavily criticized in both the industry and the government for being opaque and allegedly presenting conflicts of interest. However, since Trump took office, there has been a renewed push for new regulations and the passage of crypto legislation, as well as the apparent end to the so-called regulation-by-enforcement practiced by regulators during former President Joe Biden’s administration. With stablecoin legislation seemingly around the corner, potentially followed by a comprehensive market structure bill and strategic bitcoin reserve legislation, Don Jr. said the improved regulatory clarity for the industry will be a boon for bitcoin. “I think you have the perfect storm for this thing just going to the moon, as they say,” he said.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/05/27/donald-trump-jr-says-getting-debanked-de-insured-de-everything-orange-pilled-him,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","Policy|News",cryptocompare

2025-05-28T01:00:03.000Z,"BlockDAG’s $272M Momentum Grows as Referrals Power Surge, LINK Targets $21.99, and HYPE Rises Rapidly","Chainlink (LINK) is drawing attention as it nears a long-standing resistance point, with analysts watching closely for signs of a breakout. At the same time, Hyperliquid (HYPE) is already making big moves, spiking on massive trades and growing technical support. These shifts highlight how community engagement is influencing performance. A clear example is BlockDAG (BDAG) . Its 25% referral reward structure is turning everyday buyers into promoters. With an easy system, instant BDAG rewards, and low entry costs, BlockDAG is scaling fast. The project has already raised over $272 million. Chainlink: Resistance Test at $21.99 Holds Traders’ Focus Chainlink (LINK) price movement is pressing against a strong resistance trendline. Trading around $15.39, the coin is testing patience, with many pointing to $21.99 as the next target if it breaks past the downtrend from December 2024. A breakout here could change LINK’s short-term direction and trigger further gains. However, volume levels remain mixed and momentum appears shaky. The $21.99 mark remains the key number for now, with many traders waiting for a confirmed move above. Hyperliquid: Whale Moves and Technicals Push Toward $43.17 Hyperliquid (HYPE) jumped over 11% in just one day, touching $39.93. The surge followed public trading wins, including James Wynn’s $25 million BTC play. Market watchers also spotted $28 million in whale buys near $35. Technicals suggest more upside. HYPE is testing the 2.618 Fibonacci level at $43.17. RSI is at a hot 85.72, and MACD is also flashing bullish, meaning the move could continue if momentum sticks. BlockDAG: $272M Raised as Referrals Ignite Viral Growth BlockDAG’s referral system is built for simplicity and speed. When someone refers a friend, they receive 25% of their purchase value in BDAG. The person joining also earns an extra 5%, making it rewarding on both ends. With an entry point as low as $15, the system encourages fast sharing and onboarding. Already, more than 170,000 holders have joined the BDAG ecosystem, reflecting just how quickly this model is scaling. The numbers behind BlockDAG back the hype. It has raised over $272 million and sold more than 21.3 billion coins so far. The price, which began at $0.001, has jumped to $0.0262, showing a 2,520% gain from batch one. Until June 13, BDAG is available for a limited time at a frozen price of $0.0020, offering a possible 2,400% upside before it reaches its official launch price of $0.05. What’s building excitement is the confirmed GO LIVE reveal set for June 13. BlockDAG will announce listings on 20 centralized exchanges, a move that could boost visibility and drive larger participation. With a solid referral program, accessible pricing, and upcoming major milestones, BlockDAG appears well-positioned among the top crypto players to watch in 2025. Key Insights Chainlink (LINK) remains in limbo as it presses against major resistance. Hyperliquid (HYPE), meanwhile, is proving that volume and excitement can shift charts quickly. But the standout right now is BlockDAG. Its $272 million raise and viral referral system are changing how new projects grow. At $0.0020 until June 13, BDAG may be one of the most talked-about coins as the market eyes the next wave. With strong community action and a GO LIVE reveal around the corner, BlockDAG is showing what modern crypto growth looks like.

The legislative text is focused on putting forward a regulatory framework in which we can enforce actions to strengthen this broader market, in particular to the benefit of American consumers and innovation and development here.”Democratic Senator Marker Warner voiced a similar sentiment before the GENIUS Act passed on May 19, stating that the US couldn’t “afford to keep standing on the sidelines” while the crypto industry evolves.“We cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay,” Warner said. “If American lawmakers don’t shape it, others will — and not in ways that serve our interests or democratic values.”Steil credits DemocratsSteil acknowledged that Democratic lawmakers have made an effort to better understand the crypto industry’s gripes with how the Biden administration handled regulation and enforcement of the sector.He said the political landscape and nature of crypto-related negotiations “looked a little different,” but over 70 Democrats in the last Congress signaled the need for clear crypto rules when the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) passed the House in May 2024.Related: Trump supports bill to buy 1 million BTC — Senator Lummis“I think that was a great practice run,” said Steil.The FIT21 Act wasn’t enacted before the end of the last Congress However, House Agricultural and Financial Services Committee chairs Glenn Thompson and French Hill introduced a new crypto market structure bill on May 5 that aims to build on FIT21.If lawmakers pass those bills, they will have the opportunity to explore a lot of other “interesting, creative ideas” in the space, Steil said.Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside storyAdditional reporting by Turner Wright",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/steil-wants-lawmakers-restrain-adding-non-relevant-items-crypto-bills?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-28T02:11:48.000Z,"Real-world assets could revitalize dying NFT lending market: DappRadar","Real-world assets linking up with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is one of a few key catalysts that could reignite the waning NFT lending sector, which is suffering from a collapse in volumes and user activity, says blockchain analytics platform DappRadar.Volumes in the NFT lending market, which allows NFT holders to take out a loan against their token, have dropped 97% from a peak of around $1 billion in January 2024 to $50 million in May, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a May 27 report.Gherghelas said for NFT lending to “move beyond survival mode,” it needs “new catalysts” to reignite the sector, such as real-world asset NFTs, like tokenized real estate or yield-bearing assets that could unlock more stable, trusted collateral sources.“So far, 2025 has not delivered a compelling reason for NFT lending to bounce back,” she said. “While the infrastructure is still here and the platforms remain active, activity has slowed across the board.” Borrower and leading activity have taken a big hit in the NFT lending sector. Source: DappRadar“For now, the sector seems to be in a holding pattern, waiting either for market recovery or a new use case to reignite interest.”Gherghelas added that other catalysts that could rekindle NFT lending were tools that make it easier for NFT holders to borrow against their tokens, and that protocols should create “smart infrastructure” such as undercollateralized loans, credit scores and artificial intelligence risk matching.The report adds that since January last year, borrower activity has declined by 90% and those willing to lend have shrunk by 78%.The average NFT loan size has also taken a hit from a peak of $22,000 in 2022 to $4,000 in May, a 71% year-over-year drop.Gherghelas said this shift “shows that either users are borrowing against lower-value assets or simply becoming more conservative with leverage.”NFT lending overall trading volume and market activity have dropped off from the all-time highs of past years. Source: DappRadarThe average loan duration is also lower; after hitting an average of roughly 40 days in 2023, it’s been down to 31 days and has held steady throughout 2024 and into 2025.Gherghelas said this could indicate that “loans are being taken more frequently but for shorter periods, perhaps a sign of more tactical liquidity plays.”NFT ﻿market downturn also hurts lendingPart of the slowdown in NFT lending is connected to the overall NFT market decline, which has seen volumes drop 61% in the first quarter to $1.5 billion compared to $4.1 billion a year ago.“With collateral value collapsing, the lending activity naturally followed,” Gherghelas said. “There are a few exceptions that managed to hold or regain traction, but they’ve been outliers, not enough to lift the sector.”Related: AI decentralized apps are coming for the Web3 throne: DappRadarThe protocol landscape has also narrowed, and the number of active NFT lending apps is limited, with only eight protocols holding any meaningful share.“The flip-for-liquidity model that worked during bull markets isn’t built for a quieter, more risk-averse environment. But that doesn’t mean NFT lending is finished; it’s simply shifting focus,” Gherghelas said.“Platforms are diversifying, use cases are shifting, and collateral preferences are changing. If the next wave builds on utility, culture, and better design, NFT lending might just find its second wind — one built to last.”Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-world-assets-revitalize-dying-nft-lending-dappradar?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

SharpLink will invest $425 million to acquire 120,000 ETH. Ethereum futures open interest hits an all-time high of $36.1 billion, with ETH price climbing 4.5% on the daily chart. Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming (SBET) announced a $425 million private investment in public equity (PIPE), acquiring approximately 69.1 million shares at $6.15 each to establish the first Nasdaq-listed Ethereum (ETH) treasury company.Spearheaded by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, this move mirrors Strategy’s (MSTR) successful Bitcoin treasury strategy, which has yielded over $8.2 billion in gains in 2025, by leveraging stock and bond sales to acquire BTC.Former Ethereum core developer and contributor Eric Conner highlighted the bullish implications of SharpLink’s move, noting its potential to create a “public ETH proxy for funds that can’t hold tokens directly.” Conner emphasized that the acquisition of 120,000 ETH—likely to be staked—could lead to “supply compression” by removing tokens from circulation. The Ether proponent also pointed to the “new narrative fuel” this provides, positioning ETH as a “digital reserve collateral” and potentially driving its adoption on mainstream balance sheets through an equity wrapper like $SBET.However, crypto analyst VICTOR cautioned against over-enthusiasm, outlining the risk of leveraging gains from an altcoin still down 19% in 2025. In Q1 2025, Cointelegraph reported a sharp decline in Ethereum network fees, dropping to $605,000 from $2.5 million in just two weeks in March, alongside a noticeable decrease in decentralized app (DApp) activity.

The majority of these rallies—eight out of ten—resulted in negative returns, while one rally triggered a short squeeze, driving prices higher, and another displayed neutral price action.From a technical perspective, Ether’s price action on the daily chart posted a descending triangle, a bullish breakout pattern, which creates equal highs and higher lows, converging toward an imminent rally. The pattern is bordered by two trendlines, the upper resistance, currently around $2,700 and the ascending support line. A bullish breakout above $2,677 targets the pattern’s measured move, calculated by adding the triangle’s height to the breakout point.

Speaking at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, Sigel said the most viable path forward may involve inserting Bitcoin mining incentives into the congressional budget reconciliation process.According to Sigel, the most effective path to growing a US strategic Bitcoin reserve would be through targeted amendments to congressional budget legislation. These could include tax credits for mining companies that use methane gas and other incentives aimed at encouraging miners to share a portion of their mined BTC with the federal government. He argued that such an approach would allow the reserve to grow organically over time. Sigel also highlighted the limitations of executive actions in achieving this goal:\""The problem with executive action is that it's going to prompt lawsuits. And anything over $100 million is going to get sued by the Elizabeth Warrens of the world.

FalconX, a digital asset broker, said it secured a facility worth over $100 million as part of a “broader credit framework,” while Maple Finance reportedly closed the first tranche of an agreement with Cantor.The service allows companies holding Bitcoin to borrow funds and use the cryptocurrency as collateral, providing a way to unlock liquidity without selling their BTC holdings. Cantor announced its Bitcoin financing business with an initial capital of $2 billion in July 2024, targeting institutional investors seeking to leverage their Bitcoin. At the time, the company said Anchorage Digital and Copper would serve as custodians and collateral managers in the venture.Credit markets are a fundamental part of the financial system, allowing capital to flow between borrowers and lenders and supporting economic activity across sectors. Their central role also means they can contribute to financial distress when risks are mismanaged. While mirroring some functions of traditional finance, crypto credit markets have been operating with less regulatory oversight.Digital asset crisis of 2022 This dynamic was evident during the 2022 crisis in the digital asset sector. Celsius Network, once a leading crypto lending platform, collapsed after engaging in risky financial practices and facing allegations of fraud. Similarly, BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2022 following significant exposure to the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.  According to a report from Galaxy, the total crypto lending market, including crypto-backed collateralized debt positions (CDPs) tied to stablecoins, stood at $36.5 billion in the last quarter of 2024, marking a 43% decline from its all-time high of $64.4 billion in 2021. Despite the broader contraction, onchain lending platforms have seen a dramatic rebound, with open borrowed positions surging to $19.1 billion by Q4 2024, a 959% increase over two years.

2025-05-27T15:40:00.000Z,"93% of all Bitcoin is already mined. Here’s what that means","How much Bitcoin is left to mine?              Bitcoin’s total supply is hardcoded at 21 million BTC, a fixed upper limit that cannot be altered without a consensus-breaking change to the protocol. This finite cap is enforced at the protocol level and is central to Bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset.As of May 2025, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoin (BTC) have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created, and those remaining coins will be mined very slowly.The reason for this uneven distribution is Bitcoin’s exponential issuance schedule, governed by an event called the halving. When Bitcoin launched in 2009, the block reward was 50 BTC. Every 210,000 blocks — or approximately every four years — that reward is cut in half. Because the early rewards were so large, over 87% of the total supply was mined by the end of 2020. Each subsequent halving sharply reduces the rate of new issuance, meaning it will take over a century to mine the remaining 6.7%.According to current estimates, 99% of all Bitcoin will have been mined by 2035, but the final fraction — the last satoshis — won’t be produced until around the year 2140 due to the nature of geometric reward reduction.This engineered scarcity, combined with an immutable supply cap, is what draws comparisons between Bitcoin and physical commodities like gold. But Bitcoin is even more predictable: Gold’s supply grows at around 1.7% annually, whereas Bitcoin’s issuance rate is transparently declining.Did you know? Bitcoin’s supply curve is not terminal in the traditional sense. It follows an asymptotic trajectory — a kind of economic Zeno’s paradox — where rewards diminish indefinitely but never truly reach zero. Mining will continue until around 2140, by which point over 99.999% of the total 21 million BTC will have been issued.                  Beyond the supply cap: How lost coins make Bitcoin scarcer than you think              While over 93% of Bitcoin’s total supply has been mined, that doesn’t mean it’s all available. A significant portion is permanently out of circulation, lost due to forgotten passwords, misplaced wallets, destroyed hard drives or early adopters who never touched their coins again.Estimates from firms like Chainalysis and Glassnode suggest that between 3.0 million and 3.8 million BTC — roughly 14%-18% of the total supply — is likely gone for good. That includes high-profile dormant addresses like the one believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, which alone holds over 1.1 million BTC.This means Bitcoin’s true circulating supply may be closer to 16 million-17 million, not 21 million. And because Bitcoin is non-recoverable by design, any lost coins stay lost — permanently reducing supply over time.Now compare that to gold. Around 85% of the world’s total gold supply has been mined — approximately 216,265 metric tons, according to the World Gold Council — but nearly all of it remains in circulation or held in vaults, jewelry, ETFs and central banks. Gold can be remelted and reused; Bitcoin cannot be resurrected once access is lost.This distinction gives Bitcoin a kind of hardening scarcity, a supply that not only stops growing over time but quietly shrinks.As Bitcoin matures, it’s entering a monetary phase similar to gold: low issuance, high holder concentration and increasing demand-side sensitivity. But Bitcoin takes it further; its supply cap is hard, its loss rate is permanent, and its distribution is publicly auditable.This may lead to several outcomes:Increased price volatility as available supply becomes more limited and sensitive to market demandHigher long-term value concentration in the hands of those who remain active and secure in their key managementA premium on liquidity, where actually spendable BTC trades at a higher effective value than dormant supply.In extreme cases, this could produce a bifurcation between “circulating BTC” and “unreachable BTC,” with the former gaining greater economic significance, particularly in times of constrained exchange liquidity or macroeconomic stress.                  What happens when Bitcoin is fully mined?              There’s a popular assumption that as Bitcoin’s block rewards shrink, the network’s security will eventually suffer. But in practice, the mining economy is far more adaptive — and much more resilient — than that.Bitcoin’s mining incentives are governed by a self-correcting feedback loop: If mining becomes unprofitable, miners drop off the network, which in turn triggers a difficulty adjustment. Every 2,016 blocks (roughly every two weeks), the network recalibrates mining difficulty using a parameter known as nBits. The goal is to keep block times steady at around 10 minutes, regardless of how many miners are competing.So, if Bitcoin’s price drops, or the reward becomes too small relative to operating costs, inefficient miners simply exit. This causes difficulty to fall, lowering the cost for those who remain. The result is a system that continually rebalances itself, aligning network participation with available incentives.This mechanism has already been tested at scale. After China banned mining in mid-2021, Bitcoin’s global hashrate dropped by more than 50% in a matter of weeks. Yet the network continued to function without interruption, and within a few months, the hashrate fully recovered, as miners resumed operations in jurisdictions with lower energy costs and more favorable regulations.Critically, the idea that lower rewards will inherently threaten network security overlooks how mining is tied to profit margins, not nominal BTC amounts. As long as the market price supports the cost of hash power — even at 0.78125 BTC per block (post-2028 halving) or lower — miners will continue to secure the network.In other words, it’s not the absolute reward that matters, but whether mining remains profitable relative to costs. And thanks to Bitcoin’s built-in difficulty adjustment, it usually does.Even a century from now, when the block reward approaches zero, the network will likely still be protected by whatever combination of fees, base incentives and infrastructure efficiency exists at that time. But that’s a distant concern. In the meantime, the current system — hashrate adjusts, difficulty rebalances, miners adapt — remains one of the most robust elements of Bitcoin’s design.Did you know? On April 20, 2024, following the launch of the Runes protocol, Bitcoin miners earned over $80 million in transaction fees within a single day, surpassing the $26 million earned from block rewards. This marked the first time in Bitcoin’s history that transaction fees alone exceeded the block subsidy in daily miner revenue.                  The future of Bitcoin mining: Energy consumption              It’s a common misconception that rising Bitcoin prices will drive endless energy use. In reality, mining is constrained by profitability, not price alone.As block rewards shrink, miners are pushed toward thinner margins, and that means chasing the cheapest, cleanest energy available. Since China’s 2021 mining ban, hashrate has migrated to regions like North America and Northern Europe, where operators tap into surplus hydro, wind and underutilized grid energy.According to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, between 52% and 59% of Bitcoin mining now runs on renewables or low-emission sources. Regulations are reinforcing this trend, with several jurisdictions offering incentives for clean-powered mining or penalizing fossil-fuel operations.Moreover, the idea that higher BTC prices will always mean higher energy use misses how Bitcoin self-regulates: More miners raise difficulty, which compresses margins, capping energy expansion. Renewable-based mining brings its own challenges, but the dystopian future of endlessly expanding fossil-fueled hash power is increasingly unlikely.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/93-of-all-bitcoin-is-already-mined-heres-what-that-means?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T15:00:00.000Z,"ZKPs can prove I&#039;m old enough without telling you my age","Opinion by: Andre Omietanski, General Counsel, and Amal Ibraymi, Legal Counsel at Aztec LabsWhat if you could prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthday, name, or anything else at all? Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) make this hypothetical a reality and solve one of the key challenges online: verifying age without sacrificing privacy. The need for better age verification todayWe're witnessing an uptick in laws being proposed restricting minors' access to social media and the internet, including in Australia, Florida, and China. To protect minors from inappropriate adult content, platform owners and governments often walk a tightrope between inaction and overreach. For example, the state of Louisiana in the US recently enacted a law meant to block minors from viewing porn. Sites required users to upload an ID before viewing content. The Free Speech Coalition challenged the law as unconstitutional, making the case that it infringed on First Amendment rights. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed on procedural grounds. The reaction, however, highlights the dilemma facing policymakers and platforms: how to block minors without violating adults' rights or creating new privacy risks.Traditional age verification failsCurrent age verification tools are either ineffective or invasive. Self-declaration is meaningless, since users can simply lie about their age. ID-based verification is overly invasive. No one should be required to upload their most sensitive documents, putting themselves at risk of data breaches and identity theft. Biometric solutions like fingerprints and face scans are convenient for users but raise important ethical, privacy, and security concerns. Biometric systems are not always accurate and may generate false positives and negatives. The irreversible nature of the data, which can't be changed like a regular password can, is also less than ideal. Other methods, like behavioral tracking and AI-driven verification of browser patterns, are also problematic, using machine learning to analyze user interactions and identify patterns and anomalies, raising concerns of a surveillance culture.ZKPs as the privacy-preserving solutionZero-knowledge proofs present a compelling solution. Like a government ID provider, a trusted entity verifies the user's age and generates a cryptographic proof confirming they are over the required age. Websites only need to check the proof, not the excess personal data, ensuring privacy while keeping minors at the gates. No centralized data storage is required, alleviating the burden on platforms such as Google, Meta, and WhatsApp and eliminating the risk of data breaches. Recent: How zero-knowledge proofs can make AI fairerAdopting and enforcing ZKPs at scaleZKPs aren't a silver bullet. They can be complex to implement. The notion of \""don't trust, verify,\"" proven by indisputable mathematics, may cause some regulatory skepticism. Policymakers may hesitate to trust cryptographic proofs over visible ID verification. There are occasions when companies may need to disclose personal information to authorities, such as during an investigation into financial crimes or government inquiries. This would challenge ZKPs, whose very intention is for platforms not to hold this data in the first place.ZKPs also struggle with scalability and performance, being somewhat computationally intensive and tricky to program. Efficient implementation techniques are being explored, and breakthroughs, such as the Noir programming language, are making ZKPs more accessible to developers, driving the adoption of secure, privacy-first solutions. A safer, smarter future for age verificationGoogle's move to adopt ZKPs for age verification is a promising signal that mainstream platforms are beginning to embrace privacy-preserving technologies. But to fully realize the potential of ZKPs, we need more than isolated solutions locked into proprietary ecosystems. Crypto-native wallets can go further. Open-source and permissionless blockchain-based systems offer interoperability, composability, and programmable identity. With a single proof, users can access a range of services across the open web — no need to start from scratch every time, or trust a single provider (Google) with their credentials.ZKPs flip the script on online identity — proving what matters, without exposing anything else. They protect user privacy, help platforms stay compliant, and block minors from restricted content, all without creating new honeypots of sensitive data.Google's adoption of ZKPs shows mainstream momentum is building. But to truly transform digital identity, we must embrace crypto-native, decentralized systems that give users control over what they share and who they are online.In an era defined by surveillance, ZKPs offer a better path forward — one that's secure, private, and built for the future.Opinion by: Andre Omietanski, General Counsel, and Amal Ibraymi, Legal Counsel at Aztec Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-27T14:30:00.000Z,"What is a cryptocurrency mixer and how does it work?","Cryptocurrency mixers explained              A cryptocurrency mixer is a specialized service designed to increase the privacy and anonymity of blockchain transactions. Unlike traditional financial transactions, which are private by default, most cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) operate on public blockchains. This means every transaction is permanently recorded and accessible to anyone, making it possible for blockchain analysts or malicious actors to trace the flow of funds between wallets.A crypto mixer’s primary function is to break the link between the sender’s wallet and the recipient’s wallet. It does so by pooling together coins from many users and then redistributing them in a way that makes it difficult to track which coins went where. Think of it like a digital version of shuffling cards in a deck. After mixing, your cryptocurrency is returned to you or a recipient’s address, but it’s “cleaned” of any direct transaction history.This privacy-enhancing feature is why some people rely on mixers, especially those seeking to keep their financial activities confidential in an open-ledger world.                  How does a crypto mixer work?              To understand a crypto mixer, it’s useful to compare it to the concept of money laundering in traditional finance, albeit with legal and ethical nuances. The process of “mixing” is essentially designed to obscure the origin and destination of coins.Here’s a typical workflow of how a cryptocurrency mixer operates:Deposit: You send your cryptocurrency to the mixer’s wallet address. Multiple users do the same, creating a large pool of coins.Mixing/shuffling: The mixer’s system pools and shuffles these coins together, breaking any visible connection between deposited and withdrawn funds.Redistribution: After mixing, the service sends back an equivalent amount of coins to your specified address, but these aren’t the same coins you deposited. They come from the pooled coins of all participants.Fees: The mixer usually deducts a small fee, generally ranging from 1% to 3%, to cover operational costs.This process effectively disrupts blockchain analysis, making it extremely difficult for anyone to trace the coins back to their original owners.                  Types of cryptocurrency mixers              Not all mixers are created equal. They can broadly be divided into two categories: centralized and decentralized mixers.Centralized mixersCentralized mixers are the most common and operate similarly to traditional services. You send your coins to a company or entity that controls the mixing process, and then they send back “clean” coins after mixing. These services are relatively easy to use, often providing a simple user interface.However, centralized mixers require you to trust the service operator with your coins, at least temporarily. This introduces risks such as:The mixer could be a scam and disappear with your funds.It could be hacked, exposing users’ data and coins.The operator may keep logs that could compromise your privacy.Decentralized mixersDecentralized mixers use blockchain technology and smart contracts to automate the mixing process without a trusted third party. They rely on cryptographic methods such as zero-knowledge proofs to mix coins in a trustless environment. Users pool their coins into a smart contract, which then redistributes coins in a way that ensures privacy.Advantages of decentralized mixers include:No central point of failure or custody risk.Higher privacy because no single party controls the funds.Often more resistant to regulatory crackdowns.Did you know? The DOJ indicted four Russians for operating crypto mixers Blender.io and Sinbad.io, yet failed to show they knowingly laundered illicit funds. The indictment relies heavily on vague forum posts and lacks concrete evidence of criminal intent or ties to US commerce, raising serious doubts about its strength in court.                  Real-world cases involving mixers and scams              Unfortunately, the privacy offered by crypto mixers has also attracted criminals. The very anonymity that protects innocent users can also shield illicit activities, leading to widespread misuse.Crypto mixers have been linked to ransomware attacks, dark web marketplaces, fraud and drug trafficking. Criminals often use these services to “clean” proceeds from illegal transactions and hide their tracks from law enforcement.A notable example is ChipMixer, a service seized by Europol in 2023 for allegedly facilitating money laundering for dark web markets and ransomware groups. Authorities dismantled the platform’s infrastructure over alleged money laundering, seizing four servers, 1,909.4 BTC (about $210 million as of May 26, 2025) and seven TB of data across 55 transactions.Mixers have also been involved in laundering stolen funds from cryptocurrency exchange hacks. The complexity of these transactions makes it difficult for investigators to recover stolen assets.In February 2025, Bybit, a major cryptocurrency exchange, suffered a significant security breach resulting in the theft of about $1.5 billion worth of cryptocurrencies. The attackers, attributed to the Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking organization, employed various crypto mixers, including Wasabi, CryptoMixer, Railgun and Tornado Cash, to launder portions of the stolen assets. Despite efforts to trace the funds, a significant portion remains unaccounted for, highlighting the challenges posed by mixers in cybersecurity investigations.                  Are crypto mixers legal?              The legal status of cryptocurrency mixers depends largely on the jurisdiction and context of their use.Most governments impose strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing regulations on financial services, including digital currency services. Mixers, by their nature, complicate AML compliance because they obscure transaction trails.For instance,In the European Union, the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD) includes digital currency providers under its regulatory scope, requiring them to perform KYC checks and report suspicious activity.In the United States, FinCEN classifies cryptocurrency mixers as money transmitters, requiring registration and compliance with AML regulations. Unlicensed mixers can face severe penalties and criminal charges.Legal uses vs misuseUsing a mixer for privacy reasons is not inherently illegal. However, if mixers are used to launder proceeds from crimes, authorities will prosecute offenders. Similarly, operating a mixer without appropriate licenses or regulatory oversight can be illegal.If you choose to use a mixer, make sure you understand the legal implications in your country and avoid any activity that could be linked to money laundering or fraud.Did you know? Crypto mixer transactions are still taxable. Using a mixer doesn’t hide gains from tax authorities; failing to report them can trigger audits or penalties. Always keep records and understand your local tax obligations.                  How to stay safe and avoid scam-linked mixers              If you decide to use a cryptocurrency mixer, your safety and security should be paramount. Here are some essential tips to avoid scams and legal troubles:Choose reputable mixers: Conduct thorough research. Look for mixers with good reviews, transparent operations and clear compliance policies.Avoid unknown or suspicious services: Steer clear of mixers linked to scams, hacks or regulatory actions.Check for licensing and compliance: Prefer mixers that comply with AML/KYC regulations, especially if you are a business or high-value user.Understand fees and timelines: Be clear on the fees involved and the expected time for your funds to be returned after mixing.Use hardware wallets and strong security practices: Always safeguard your private keys and use hardware wallets to minimize risks.Stay updated on regulations: Laws surrounding crypto mixers evolve rapidly. Staying informed will help you avoid inadvertent legal violations.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-mixer-and-how-does-it-work?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T12:00:15.000Z,"StarkWare launches mobile-friendly zero-knowledge prover","Blockchain company StarkWare has unveiled zero-knowledge (ZK) prover STARK Two (S-two), enabling enhanced privacy and verification on everyday devices like phones, laptops and browsers. The company said the new ZK prover allows users to generate complex cryptographic proofs from the client side. This means users can generate ZK-proofs directly on their devices instead of relying on a server or cloud infrastructure, opening the door for faster and more private applications across the internet. “S-two will bring STARK proving to everyday devices, and open the door for new real-world proving use cases,” said Eli Ben-Sasson, StarkWare co-founder and CEO, adding that the tool could empower the next wave of ZK applications. The company said the ZK prover is now available in public alpha and is set to roll out on Starknet, its Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, later this year.  StarkWare says new ZK prover is 39 times faster than old solutions StarkWare said that benchmark tests for the S-two ZK prover showed that it was 39 times faster than previous solutions. The performance leap enables smoother experiences in privacy-enhancing applications. The upgrade also allows use cases in private transactions, ZK-based identity and verifiable artificial intelligence. StarkWare said S-two runs on CPUs, GPUs and will soon be on browsers. “For years we’ve called the prover our magic wand, a tool that transforms complex computation into a simple proof,” Ben-Sasson said. “Now, the wand has become a lightsaber in your pocket, something anyone can wield, instantly, from your own device.”According to StarkWare, developers can build with S-two, adding that its alpha release supports hardware targets. Furthermore, the company said ZK ecosystem participants like Kakarot, Nexus, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs have already adopted the technology. Kakarot uses S-two inside ETHProofs to generate Ethereum block proofs more efficiently, while Nexus is standardizing RISC-V traces to align with S-two’s architecture. Meanwhile, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs are adding GPU acceleration to push the prover’s performance even further.Use cases for S-two zero-knowledge proverStarkWare chief operating officer Oren Katz told Cointelegraph that S-two marks a shift in how ZK-proofs are used in daily lives. Generating validity proofs directly in devices will allow privacy-preserving features in messaging, payments and digital identity. “You can prove a payment was valid without showing your balance, or verify identity without revealing personal details,” Katz added. Katz said that even salary payments could be made onchain with full transparency and no exposure of sensitive information. He dubbed the development a “big step toward bringing zero-knowledge tech into the mainstream.”Beyond privacy, Katz said, local proof generation also unlocks use cases in other industries. The executive told Cointelegraph that it can allow gamers to play offline and later generate cryptographic proof of their achievements. “An operator, instead of running all logic onchain to prove integrity, can run it on their own servers and simply generate a proof that it was executed correctly,” Katz added.Related: Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden’s cashless-society rethinkNew ZK prover follows Ethereum’s privacy pushThe launch of StarWare’s upgraded ZK prover follows Ethereum’s push for better privacy. On April 11, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin published a roadmap that addressed privacy enhancements for wallets, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and infrastructure. Buterin advocated implementing privacy-enhancing norms and features across the Ethereum ecosystem, including adding privacy tools in ETH wallets. Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/starkware-unveils-s-two-client-side-zk-prover?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T08:45:00.000Z,"How central banks are testing blockchain-based monetary policy","Why are central banks looking at blockchains?              Central banks are tiptoeing into the world of blockchain not because it is fashionable but because every part of the money-making machine, from settlement rails to asset custody, is slowly being rewritten as code.The financial industry is already tokenizing money-market funds, Treasurys and even bank deposits. According to the Atlantic Council, 134 jurisdictions are studying or piloting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), up from just 35 in 2020. Meanwhile, commercial banks have begun to warn that if they cannot move tokenized deposits across public blockchains such as Solana or private ledgers like R3 Corda, they risk being left behind.From a central bank’s vantage point, two questions matter:First, can traditional operations, such as open-market purchases, standing facilities and reserve remuneration still work if reserves and government bonds become smart tokens? Second, can monetary transmission improve when policy logic is hard-wired into code? These questions motivate pilots such as Project Pine, Project Guardian in Singapore, the Bank of England’s wholesale CBDC sandbox and Japan’s multiyear retail CBDC pilot.                  What is “tokenized” monetary policy?              Tokenized monetary policy means that the liabilities and assets a central bank uses to steer short-term interest rates exist as programmable tokens on a distributed-ledger platform. In such a token arrangement, what the BIS describes as an ecosystem where money and securities share a common ledger, monetary functions are executed by smart contracts, replacing the traditional batch file processes used in overnight real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems.In practice, each policy tool is expressed as code:Interest on reserves becomes an automated coupon that accrues to a wallet address once a block closes.Repo and reverse-repo agreements become conditional asset swaps that self-liquidate at maturity.Collateral haircuts are numeric parameters the central bank can toggle in real time, with changes propagating instantly to all counterparties.Project Pine demonstrated all three, using ERC-20 tokens for reserves and securities on a permissioned Ethereum-compatible chain.But how is tokenized monetary policy different from traditional monetary policy?Traditional policy operations rely on central bank systems such as Fedwire or the Bank of England’s RTGS. These systems close overnight, settle in discrete batches and require multiple human sign-offs. A tokenized system settles atomically in seconds, keeps an immutable audit trail and lets policy adjustments propagate without waiting for dealers to book trades. The BIS paper on tokenisation notes that combining assets and settlement on a single ledger can shrink operational risk and latency.Did you know? A repo is a short-term secured loan in which one party sells securities and agrees to repurchase them later at a higher price. In contrast, a reverse repo is the same transaction viewed from the counterparty’s perspective (buying the securities and later reselling them).                  What is Project Pine?              Project Pine is a research initiative led by the BIS Innovation Hub and the New York Fed that explores how central banks could run monetary policy in a future where money and government securities are digital tokens managed on blockchain-like systems.Launched in late 2024 and published in May 2025, the project built a working prototype, a “starter kit” for central banks, designed to test whether tools like interest on reserves, repo operations and asset purchases can be run using smart contracts.The project ran simulated financial scenarios, mimicking both calm and crisis conditions:Normal conditions: The smart contract automatically conducted a one-day reverse-repo, draining reserves by posting bids at a pre-set interest rate.Liquidity shock: When simulated market stress pushed interest rates too high, an emergency lending facility kicked in automatically, within seconds, helping stabilize rates.Asset-purchase program: The toolkit accepted bids, calculated allocations and settled trades between digital reserves and tokenized bonds instantly.These scenarios were run in a test environment with simulated commercial banks and a programmable blockchain platform. Everything from interest payments to collateral valuation was automated, providing a glimpse into how monetary policy might function in a 24/7, tokenized financial system.This was not an isolated experiment. Other central banks are running parallel pilots that explore similar ground with their distinct approaches:Although temporarily offline as of May 24, 2025, MAS news releases show that Singapore’s Project Guardian has tested tokenized deposits and government bonds in live repo transactions, proving that interbank settlement can occur on a shared DLT without sending payments through Swift.Meanwhile, the Bank of England has taken a dual-rail approach. A July 2024 discussion paper stresses that wholesale tokenized money could sit alongside RTGS balances, letting commercial banks pick whichever rail meets their liquidity needs. Governor Andrew Bailey has warned that if tokenized deposits stall, the Bank “must continue to prepare for a wholesale CBDC.”On the retail front, Japan’s multi-year programme has entered a live “pilot” phase, constructing an end-to-end infrastructure, from smartphone wallets to a central ledger, capable of handling tens of thousands of transactions per second. The pilot also explores privacy-enhancing overlays, reflecting consumer expectations for cash-like anonymity.Taken together, these pilots confirm that key features like programmability, real-time visibility, and atomic settlement are no longer theoretical — they work. They don’t yet answer the more challenging question: How do central banks transition an entire financial system to such rails without disrupting credit creation and intermediation?Did you know? Project Pine’s digital monetary system is built like a three-layer cake: The bottom layer is a programmable blockchain (Besu), the middle is packed with tokenized money and assets (like ERC-20 reserves) and the top layer runs the smart contracts that carry out monetary policy actions.                  Why is Project Pine important?              Project Pine is the first of its kind to show that core central bank tools could be rebuilt using smart contracts. It proves that:Policy tools can be deployed faster, possibly within seconds.Facilities like repo or asset purchases can adapt automatically to changing market conditions.Tokenization could streamline operations, reduce friction and offer greater flexibility.Who was involved in Project Pine experiments?Seven major central banks, including those of Australia, Canada, England, Mexico, Switzerland, the EU and the US, collaborated on shaping the toolkit and defining test requirements. The findings don’t commit any of these banks to adopt such systems, but they provide a solid foundation for future research and policymaking.What did Project Pine test?To see how well the system works, Project Pine ran tests based on real-world situations, such as raising interest rates or a government debt crisis. They tried short and long periods, small and large financial systems, tight and loose money conditions and different ways of lending (like bank loans or corporate bonds). This helped check if the system could handle all kinds of economic ups and downs.Did you know? In Project Pine, central bank operations like paying interest on reserves or managing collateral aren’t done manually; they're handled by smart contracts coded directly into the top “protocol layer” of the blockchain stack.                  Practical design challenges in tokenized monetary policy              As central banks explore moving policy tools onto blockchains, they face several significant design hurdles. These aren’t just technical. They’re legal, operational and even philosophical. Here are the key ones:Interoperability: Can different blockchains talk to each other? Today’s financial system is like a highway with shared rules. However, blockchain ecosystems are more like separate islands, each with its own rules and roads. Public networks like Solana, private ones like Corda, or permissioned platforms like Besu don’t always “talk” to each other smoothly. This can cause issues like payment delays or funds getting stuck between platforms. Experts also warn that if too many users gather around one dominant blockchain, it could create unhealthy concentration, making the whole system more fragile.Legal finality: Does blockchain data legally count? Many countries still treat blockchain records as transaction evidence, not legally binding proof of ownership. So, even if a tokenized treasury bond moves onchain, the law might still require a separate “golden record” kept offchain by a trusted authority. Until legal systems catch up, this split could limit how far tokenized finance can go.Cyber resilience: What happens when something goes wrong? Blockchain systems run on code, and that code can have bugs. In a traditional setup, if something breaks, humans can step in. But with smart contracts, “code is law.” That’s why countries like Japan are building complete backup plans into their pilots. They’re testing how to respond to cyberattacks, technical failures or even smart contract glitches because in a digital money system, even a small error could have significant consequences.Privacy vs transparency: How much should be visible? Banks and regulators need transparency to monitor financial risks and prevent crime. But regular people want privacy, especially when using money for everyday purchases. Balancing those two needs is tricky. Policymakers are now experimenting with ideas like tiered disclosure (more visibility for big transactions), zero-knowledge proofs (which let you prove something without revealing all details), and even “anonymity vouchers” that let users make some transactions without being tracked.These challenges aren’t deal-breakers, but they do show that making money programmable isn’t as simple as flipping a switch. Central banks must work closely with lawmakers, cybersecurity experts and the financial industry to ensure tokenized monetary systems are safe, fair and reliable.                  The road ahead              The future of tokenized monetary policy will likely unfold in carefully staged phases, balancing innovation with financial stability.The BIS Innovation Hub lists more than a dozen ongoing tokenization projects from Australia’s Project Dunbar (multi-CBDC bridge) to Switzerland’s Project Helvetia (DLT-based repo). Commercial banks, meanwhile, are shifting rails: HSBC settled its first tokenized-deposit payment in April 2025, and Euroclear is piloting blockchain settlement for tokenized bonds.Central banks face a coordination game: Go slow and risk private standards hardening around them; go too fast and upend the funding model of commercial banks. The likeliest path is a phased approach:Stage 1: Limited-scope wholesale CBDC sandboxes plus tokenized collateral for central-bank counterparties.Stage 2: Dual-rail environments where RTGS balances and tokenized reserves interoperate via synchronization layers.Stage 3: Full adoption of smart-contract-based policy tools, possibly including real-time fiscal transfers.Just as earlier shifts like the rollout of RTGS systems or inflation-targeting regimes were introduced gradually to test and refine their impact, tokenized systems will be phased in through pilots, sandboxes and hybrid models before full-scale adoption.Whether it ultimately reshapes how central banks manage the economy remains to be seen.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-central-banks-are-testing-blockchain-based-monetary-policy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The initiative, currently under review by the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Thailand, will enable tourists to link their crypto holdings to credit cards for local purchases.Merchants will receive Thai baht as usual, often without knowing crypto was used in the transaction. The pilot is expected to roll out after key infrastructure and regulatory checks are in place.“This approach can be immediately adapted for Thailand, provided the supporting systems are in place,” said Pichai, noting that the model avoids using the Thai baht directly, reducing risks to the domestic currency.Related: Crypto exchange KuCoin enters crowded Thailand marketCapital markets regulation under reviewBeyond enabling crypto use for tourism, Thailand is also planning a reform of its financial laws. Pichai said the government needs to unify the legal treatment of the traditional capital market and the digital asset space, which are currently governed by separate acts.Pichai also said the government is reviewing outdated restrictions on institutional investors as part of broader capital market reform.

As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave.However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation.This caused the long-term holder realized capitalization to surge past $28 billion, a level not seen since April. Realized cap is a measure of the value of each Bitcoin based on the last time it was moved, rather than the current market price.Long-term investors are using this period of forced selling to increase their exposure and accumulate more Bitcoin for the long run, Amr Taha noted. “This strategic accumulation during moments of market stress reflects the deep conviction of LTHs.”“Rather than being shaken out by short-term volatility, they [LTH] see these liquidation-driven dips as prime opportunities to strengthen their positions, reinforcing the foundation for future price appreciation.”BTC short-term holders (red) and long-term holders (green) net realized cap.

Since the world has infinite unpredictable possibilities, LeCun believes training must happen through abstraction, which mirrors how humans make sense of the physical world.Meta’s AI brain drain Meanwhile, Meta is experiencing significant talent loss from its AI research team, particularly among the researchers who created the original Llama model in 2023, Insider reported on May 26. Just three of the original 14 Llama authors remain at Meta, and many have joined Mistral, a Paris-based startup co-founded by former Meta researchers and key Llama architects. Meta’s latest release, Llama 4, received a lukewarm reception from developers, many of whom now look to faster-moving rivals that have dedicated reasoning models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o, Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, and the recently launched Claude 4 Sonnet from Anthropic, the report added. On May 15, The Wall Street Journal reported that Meta was delaying the rollout of its flagship AI LLM, Llama 4 “Behemoth.” Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/meta-ai-boss-ai-lacks-intelligent-behavior-report?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

However, FOX5 New York reported that the man may already be in custody, citing conflicting sources.The New York Post reported that the man is the co-founder of a Swiss trading firm.Woeltz, known as the “crypto king of Kentucky,” is facing several charges, including kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment and assault. He allegedly held the victim at his apartment for 17 days.Woeltz’s assistant, Italian-born Beatrice Folchi, was also arrested, however, she was freed, and no charges have been laid against her.The arrests came after Teofrasto Carturan, aged 28 from Italy, managed to escape the apartment on May 23 — the day he had allegedly been told would be his “death day.”CNN reported that Teofrasto Carturan agreed to give up his crypto seed phrase, which was stored on his laptop in another room, and as he went to get his laptop, Woeltz turned his back, allowing him to bolt to the exit.Several New York news outlets shared videos of the victim running outside, barefoot, toward a traffic officer.Sometime after, police arrested Woeltz at his Soho apartment and took him into custody.He remains detained, and his next court date is set for May 28.Alleged victim shares ordealTeofrasto Carturan claimed to police that he arrived from Italy on May 6 and went to the Soho apartment to meet his “business partners.”Sometime later, he claimed his passport was token he was tortured to reveal his crypto seed phrase.

Antpool CEO Andy Chow said:\""Antpool has become the bridge operator for Bitlayer to support Bitcoin innovation and protect miners’ interests.”BitVM (Bitcoin Virtual Machine) is a framework that enables complex smart contracts to be deployed on the Bitcoin blockchain without changing the base protocol. The idea was introduced by Robin Linux in 2023, and allows for the complex computation involved in smart contract systems to be verified onchain and executed offchain in a way resembling optimistic rollups.Related: Here’s how Bitcoin is transforming into Web3’s backboneA BitVM implementationBitlayer is a BitVM implementation, aiming to allow Bitcoin to flow through decentralized finance (DeFi) systems and layer-2 networks. According to Chow, the implementation might lead to heightened activity in Bitcoin’s network and generate revenue for miners:“This expansion of Bitcoin’s use cases will drive more network activity, generating additional transaction fees and revenue opportunities for miners. As block rewards decrease over time, growing fee markets are critical for miners’ sustainable income.“Mining pools such as Chow’s Antpool play a critical role in the adoption of BitVM implementations because they directly determine the inclusion and validation of new types of transactions and scripts at the consensus layer.BitVM requires miners to include custom Taproot-based transactions that encode interactive verification logic. Mining pools must agree to include these non-standard or computationally intensive scripts in blocks, otherwise the protocol would simply not function.Related: StarkWare researchers propose smart contracts for Bitcoin with ColliderVMMining pool supportAccording to Hashrate Index data, Antpool controls 17.2% of Bitcoin’s hashrate as of May 26, while F2Pool controls 8.2% and Spiderpool 6.1%. This results in a total supporting hashrate of  31.5%.Bitcoin hashrate distribution between mining pools. Source: Hash Rate IndexThis is enough to secure transaction inclusion in under one in every three blocks. This is presumably enough for testing, prototyping and early-stage applications.With this percentage of supporting hashrate, developers can build functional systems with the assumption that, despite some latency, BitVM transactions will be processed. So while it is hard to view this hashrate as allowing a fully functional deployment, it is likely enough for the early phases of BitVM development.A Bitlayer representative told Cointelegraph that “should collective hashrate support weaken or policy shifts occur within Bitcoin Core, we have a multi-layered contingency plan.” This plan includes the “expanded mining pool partnerships,” referring to the company’s intention to keep onboarding more mining pools.Magazine: ZK-proofs are bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin — BitcoinOS and Starknet",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitlayer-secures-40-of-bitcoin-s-hashrate-to-bring-smart-contracts-to-btc?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

European stock markets responded positively to the development, but Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to hold the $110,000 level, leading traders to question whether a new all-time high remains within reach.Even if Bitcoin revisits the $105,000 mark, rising institutional interest and robust derivatives markets indicate that bullish traders are neither overleveraged nor concerned about a potential correction.Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized basis rate. Source: laevitas.chDemand for leveraged long Bitcoin positions grew, as evidenced by the BTC futures premium increasing to 8% on May 26. Although this was a modest rise from 6.5% the previous day, the metric still sits comfortably within the neutral range of 5% to 10%. For context, in December 2024, the Bitcoin futures premium surged to 20% when BTC surpassed $100,000 for the first time.Will Nvidia earnings and US economic data ignite Bitcoin price? President Trump’s decision to delay the EU import duties until July 9 reduced some market uncertainty, yet the broader economic consequences of the ongoing tariff conflict have yet to show up in corporate earnings. Investor risk appetite now hinges in part on Nvidia's (NVDA)  May 28 earnings report, and anticipation for this possibly explains Bitcoin’s inability to break through its previous highs.Bitcoin options markets are signaling an increased probability of upward movement.

As a result, any optimism stemming from the delayed US–EU tariffs may be tempered by ongoing concerns surrounding US government debt and the threat of a potential economic recession. The recent 5.1% drop in MBA Mortgage Applications for the week ending May 23 prompted traders to adopt a more cautious stance.While Bitcoin derivatives metrics remain healthy, upcoming economic data will be critical for market sentiment.

2025-05-26T16:25:55.000Z,"Decentralized AI could be ‘bigger than Bitcoin’ — DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino","Some of blockchain’s earliest adopters are now deeply “entrenching” themselves in decentralized AI, with ecosystems like Bittsenor (TAO) emerging as growth engines. These platforms are reshaping traditional venture capital models, enabling the best ideas to organically attract community support, staking and liquidity without the need for institutional gatekeepers.That was one of the key takeaways from Cointelegraph’s interview with Chris Miglino, the co-founder and CEO of DNA Fund, a digital asset investment firm he runs alongside fellow serial entrepreneurs Brock Peirce and Scott Walker.DNA Fund manages, among other things, five distinct funds across a range of strategies, such as a high-yield fund, an algorithmic trading fund, an AI compute fund, a liquid token fund and a venture fund — serving both company and investor capital. DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino, right, and Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi at a DNA House event in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphMiglino, who hosted Cointelegraph at a DNA House event during the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, was particularly excited about the firm’s AI compute fund.“The biggest thing that we’re working on in the whole ecosystem is our AI compute fund, where we’ve been entrenched into the TAO ecosystem,” said Miglino, referring to Bittensor, a decentralized, open-source machine learning network.Bittensor’s backers say the network stands out for its subnets, which enable specialized, incentive-based marketplaces built around a specific AI or machine learning use case. DNA Fund is “actively mining on different subnets,” having committed roughly $50 million worth of compute to the TAO ecosystem, Miglino said. “We’re willing and ready to talk to anybody that wants to launch inside that ecosystem,” he said.A snapshot of Bittensor subnets. Source: TaostatsRelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AI‘Decentralized AI is consuming everything we’re doing’Decentralized AI — the framework for developing and deploying artificial intelligence systems across a distributed network rather than a centralized authority — is currently the main focus at DNA House, Miglino said.It’s “consuming everything we’re doing,” he said. For Miglino, this paradigm has the opportunity to be “bigger than anything that’s ever existed [...] I think it has the opportunity to be bigger than Bitcoin.”While that may appear as a herculean task, given Bitcoin’s (BTC) $2.1 trillion market cap and status as the first successful decentralized monetary system of the information age, technologists broadly agree that AI will profoundly reshape human society.The AI takeover will become more apparent by the 2030s, when the technology is projected to become the world’s valuable tech sector. Source: United Nations Trade and DevelopmentDNA House is betting that ecosystems like Bittensor will drive that transformation in a decentralized way by offering developers the ability to launch businesses without having to raise outside capital: “Develop on the ecosystem, get validators that believe in your idea, [and] that’ll attract the miners and the validators together and all of a sudden you’re in business. You don’t need to go out and raise a ton of money from a bunch of VCs.”The idea that AI’s future will be decentralized is far from fringe. One of the earliest pioneers of artificial general intelligence, Ben Goertzel, told Cointelegraph that he realized the need for decentralization in AI as far back as the early 1990s, before even writing his first line of AI code.Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/decentralized-ai-bittensor-dna-fund-ceo?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-26T15:15:00.000Z,"BlackRock issues rare warning: Is Bitcoin’s future at risk from quantum tech?","BlackRock Bitcoin warning              In a rare move, BlackRock has quietly added a new line to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing — and it is turning heads. The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin’s long-term security.The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin. In their words, it could “undermine the viability” of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack.It’s the first time you’ve seen the world’s largest asset manager call out this threat so directly in a Bitcoin-related disclosure, and it says a lot about how seriously institutional players are starting to take future-proofing crypto.Yes, exchange-traded fund (ETF) risk disclosures tend to be exhaustive by nature. But the fact that quantum computing made the cut (alongside more common concerns like volatility and regulatory shifts) suggests it’s no longer just a hypothetical issue in the eyes of big finance.For investors, this signals two things: first, that Bitcoin isn’t immune to emerging tech threats, and second, that institutional players like BlackRock are actively weighing those risks as they build long-term strategies in crypto. The message is clear: If the industry wants to stay ahead, preparing for a post-quantum world can’t wait.Did you know? As of early 2025, BlackRock manages over $11.6 trillion in assets, making it the largest asset manager globally. To put that in perspective, BlackRock’s assets under management exceed the combined GDP of Germany and France.                  Bitcoin quantum risk: Is it real?              Quantum computers work differently from the laptops and servers we use today. Instead of crunching numbers one at a time, they can process huge numbers of possibilities at once. That makes them incredibly powerful — especially when it comes to cracking codes.Bitcoin’s security relies on two major cryptographic systems: SHA-256 and ECDSA. In plain terms, these are the tools that secure your Bitcoin address and make sure only you can authorize transactions. They’ve worked flawlessly for years, but quantum computers could change that.Here’s the worry: A powerful enough quantum computer might be able to reverse-engineer your private key from your public address, especially during that short window after you’ve broadcast a transaction but before it’s confirmed on the blockchain. If that ever became possible, someone could hijack your transaction and steal your coins.That sounds dramatic, but it’s not an immediate threat. Most researchers agree they’re still at least 10-20 years away from quantum machines that could actually pull this off. The tech just isn’t there yet — not at the scale or stability needed to break Bitcoin’s cryptography.Still, the warning signs are flashing. Roughly a quarter of existing Bitcoin (BTC) sits in older wallet formats that could be more vulnerable if quantum leaps happen faster than expected. And even if the timeline is long, the crypto community knows it has to act early. Work is already underway on post-quantum cryptography, which is a security system that could stand up to the next generation of computing.Did you know? Quantum computers can, in theory, solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. For instance, Google’s Sycamore processor completed a specific task in 200 seconds, whereas it would take even the most advanced classical supercomputers approximately 10,000 years to finish.                  Is Bitcoin safe from quantum computing?              While quantum computing still feels like a future problem, the crypto industry is already gearing up for it, and the efforts underway are more serious than most people realize.What Bitcoin’s doing (and not doing yet)Changing the protocol behind a blockchain is never simple; you need broad consensus, careful testing and a long lead time. But that hasn’t stopped developers from floating ideas regarding Bitcoin.One of the most talked-about proposals is something called QRAMP, the Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol. The idea is to push users to move their coins from older, potentially vulnerable wallet formats into addresses protected by newer, quantum-safe algorithms. It would require a hard fork, so it’s no small lift, but it’s a serious plan to future-proof the network before a so-called “Q-Day” sneaks up.Who’s already ahead?Some blockchains aren’t waiting around. Algorand, for example, has already integrated Falcon, a post-quantum digital signature algorithm that’s been officially vetted by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). That means transactions on Algorand are already being backed by encryption that could hold up even if quantum machines go live tomorrow.The Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) is another big one. It was built from day one with this threat in mind, using XMSS (a hash-based signature scheme) instead of traditional cryptography. It’s not a major player in market cap terms, but it’s one of the most advanced projects in terms of pure security design.Why it’s not easyOf course, none of this is simple to implement. Quantum-safe cryptography often comes with trade-offs. Algorithms like Falcon are compact and efficient, but they still require more computing resources than traditional ones. Moreover, switching everyone — miners, exchanges, wallet apps and individual users — to a new cryptographic standard could be a logistical nightmare unless it’s planned years in advance.Plus, there’s a delicate balance to strike. Move too soon, and you risk breaking things or relying on tech that isn’t battle-tested. Wait too long, and you’re exposed. That’s why many in the space are eyeing a 10-to-20-year window as a rough estimate for when quantum computing becomes a real threat. But even then, nobody wants to be the last to prepare.                  Bitcoin’s future and quantum computing              If there’s one lesson from quantum conversation so far, it’s this: Being early matters. When it comes to tech that could one day rewrite the rules of digital security, waiting around just isn’t an option.So, what does preparation look like?For developers, it starts with testing and integrating quantum-resistant algorithms into existing systems. Some are already experimenting with “hybrid” approaches, using both traditional and post-quantum cryptography side by side, so networks aren’t caught off guard if (or when) Q-Day arrives.For crypto businesses — exchanges, custodians and wallet providers — the job is twofold: Make sure your infrastructure is future-proof, and make sure your users know what’s coming. Education and UX will play a huge role here. Migrating keys and updating protocols isn’t something the average holder can or should do alone.And then there’s the regulatory side — maybe not the most exciting part of crypto, but an absolutely critical one in this context.You are already seeing movement: The NIST finalized several post-quantum cryptographic standards in 2024. That gives the industry a starting point, a common language to build around. But what’s still missing is a clear regulatory push that says, “Here’s how and when this should happen.”Good policy here wouldn’t mean clamping down on innovation — it would mean supporting it. Think: funding open-source research, incentivizing post-quantum upgrades and creating frameworks that help institutions adopt secure standards without killing momentum.Did you know? The US government began preparing for the quantum threat as far back as 2016, and in 2024, the NIST’s move was sparked by growing fears that quantum computers could one day break the encryption protecting everything from Bitcoin to national security infrastructure.A slow burn BlackRock didn’t need to bring up quantum risk in its ETF filing — but it did. And when a company of that size puts it in writing, it turns vague rumors into something much more real.The transition to a quantum-resistant crypto world isn’t going to happen overnight. It’ll be messy, slow and full of tough technical choices. But it has to happen. Finally, waiting until quantum computers are actively breaking SHA-256 in the wild would already be too late.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blackrock-issues-rare-warning-is-bitcoins-future-at-risk-from-quantum-tech?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
