2025-05-28T16:55:31.000Z,"Fed President Neel Kashkari Warns US Facing Heightened Recession Risk, Says Consumers and Businesses on Hold Amid Tariff Uncertainty","The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis says the US is currently facing a heightened recession risk. In a new interview with CNBC, Minneapolis Fed leader Neel Kashkari says he’s been having concerning discussions with small and big businesses across his region. “The most common comment that I get is that they are uncertain about the outlook, so they’re nervous about making new investment decisions. Even businesses have said to me, if they knew where the tariff would ultimately settle, then they could adjust their supply chains around that new environment. That all else being equal, they may want to lower tariffs, but wherever they settle, they could adjust to that. But right now, there’s still so much uncertainty as the negotiations are continuing. A lot of businesses are on hold, and if businesses and consumers are on hold, that introduces downside risk for the economy, potentially even recession risk.” Last week, Kashkari’s fellow Fed President Austan Goolsbee, who leads the Chicago bank, warned that President Donald Trump’s policy choices could lead to an unfavorable economic environment known as stagflation, which is dominated by stagnant economic growth, high inflation and high unemployment. If the Fed is eventually faced with twin threats of persistent inflation and a weakening economy, Kashkari argues the central bank should prioritize the fight against inflation. “For me, because inflation in the US and around most countries in the world, most advanced economies… has been elevated for four years, I’m very nervous that eventually inflation expectations might lose their anchor to that 2% target that we have. If inflation had been running at 2% or below for the last four years, I would be more comfortable, quote unquote, looking through this one-time tariff-induced inflation. But because inflation has been running hot for four years, that makes me nervous, and that makes me want to err towards protecting and defending the inflation anchor of 2%.” ?

2025-05-28T16:55:03.000Z,"Ethereum, Bitcoin price headed for another rally: Bitfinex analyst","Bitfinex analyst Jag Kooner believes that Bitcoin and Ethereum are driven by the macroeconomic environment, which is pushing them to new highs. Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) may be heading for another move higher. According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, the current macroeconomic environment is favorable for digital assets. In particular, traders are looking at Federal Reserve guidance and consumer spending data, the Bitfinex analyst shared in a note with crypto.news on May 28. For one, the Fed is under pressure from the potential inflationary effects of tariffs. If the Fed is worried about this, Kooner expects the rates will likely stay at their current level. However, core personal consumption expenditures may have a more direct impact on the dollar. You might also like: Bitcoin cements its haven asset reputation. Is the “means of exchange” narrative still alive? “The Core PCE data on Friday will be the most binary macro event. Market pricing expects stability; any downside surprise below 2.6% y/y (core) will trigger a compression in real yields and dollar softness, catalyzing capital back into crypto,” Jag Kooner, Bitfinex. If the dollar falls, traders will be looking for other assets to protect their wealth. In this context, Bitcoin is a strong option. Kooner notes that institutional inflows are strong, with $1 billion net inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs on the week ending on Sunday, May 25.

Notably, Ethereum may be driving the altcoin rally, suggests Kooner, noting that ETH was up 6% against BTC off local lows. What is more, Kooner states that this is not driven by retail demand, but more institutional interest. “This is the beginning of what might become Phase 3 of the crypto bull cycle, where BTC strength stabilizes, ETH accelerates, and capital spreads out across selective altcoins,” Kooner noted about Ethereum’s recent growth. Still, the timing of the potential rally will likely depend on the macro environment. If the Fed minutes and the PCE are favorable, this could trigger another rally. “The underlying takeaway for traders: crypto isn’t overbought, it’s underallocated—macro just decides how quickly capital flows in,” he concluded.

Balcony signed a five-year agreement with the Bergen County Clerk’s Office to migrate more than 370,000 property records onto a blockchain infrastructure built using AvaCloud on Avalanche ( AVAX ). The records represent approximately $240 billion in real estate, according to Avalanche. The project is part of a broader effort to modernize outdated public record systems, which have long relied on paper-based processes and legacy software. By transitioning to a blockchain-based system, officials aim to reduce fraud , shorten deed settlement times from months to a single day, and make public records searchable, verifiable, and resistant to manipulation.

Blockchain-based recordkeeping is being positioned as a more secure and efficient alternative. The initiative is already expanding beyond Bergen County. Municipalities including Camden, Orange, Morristown, and Fort Lee are adopting or rolling out similar systems, collectively covering over 460,000 properties and an estimated $290 billion in real estate. In Orange, the updated system reportedly helped uncover nearly $1 million in previously uncollected tax income. This marks one of the largest public-sector blockchain deployments in the U.S. to date.

In 2027, it will range between $50.88 and $59.50, with an average price of $52.31. In 2030, it will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. In December 2023, ORDI became the first BRC-20 token to breach $1 billion in market capitalization. Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation. The Ordinals protocol allows data to be embedded directly on Bitcoin’s smallest unit—the Satoshi. ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins. Currently trading at the $48 mark, investors can’t help but speculate on Ordi’s price trajectory. How high will ORDI go? Can ORDI surge 100x? What will the price of ORDI be in 2030? Let’s explore the ORDI price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ordinals Symbol ORDI Current price $10.68 Market cap $223.31M 24-hour trading volume $96.33M Circulating supply 21M All-time high $96.17 on Mar 5, 2024 All-time low $2.86 on Sep 11, 2023 24-hour high $11.25 24-hour low $10.55 ORDI price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility (30-day variation) 15.08 50-day SMA $8.61 200-day SMA $18.93 Sentiment Neutral Fear and Greed Index 71 (Greed) Green days 14/30 (47%) ORDI price analysis: ORDI moves into consolidation On the day of writing (May 28), ORDI’s price rose by 0.50% in 24 hours and 35.52% in the last thirty days. Its trading volume dropped by 3.49% in 24 hours, showing waning interest from traders. ORDI/USD 1-day chart ORDI/USD 1-day price chart. Source TradingView The Ordinal daily chart shows that ORDI trades along the William alligator trendlines, signaling a neutral market sentiment. The move comes as Bitcoin pulls back from $109,000. The signal and MACD lines of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator are above zero, with the histograms in negative territory signaling a market divergence. At the same time, the relative strength index shows that the price is in neutral territory at 55.84. It is overbought when it rises above 70. ORDI/USD 4-hour chart ORDI/USD 4-hour chart. Image source: TradingView Technical analysis of the 4-hour chart shows that ORDI has corrected from the month’s high at $13.61 and is at $10.70, losing about 20% of its value.

ORDI is neutral at current levels, with the fear and greed index showing greed among investors. On the charts, it is consolidating after correcting from the month’s high. Recent news: Ordinals can now bridge to Cardano Cardano has continued to advance as a venue for Bitcoin Defi, facilitating a transfer of Ordinals to its mainnet. The transaction between Bitcoin and Cardano was facilitated by BitVMX, an interoperability protocol built using the BitVM programming language and unveiled at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Why is ORDI down? ORDI is in a bear run this year. The drop in the ORDI value could be attributed to the market’s correction from the bull run in the last quarter of 2024. Will ORDI recover? ORDI is currently trading at its lowest this year and is ripe for a reversal. It should recover in the coming months. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will get to $1,000 before 2030. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030? According to the 2030 Ordinals price prediction, they will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. What is the Sats ordinal price prediction for 2050? When we extrapolate Ordi’s price predictions, we find that it is likely to reach a high of $421 in 2050. Does ORDI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ORDI will trade higher in the years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is ORDI a good investment? ORDI had the first-mover advantage on the Ordinals protocol. ORDI, like Bitcoin, has a capped supply of 21 million coins and should, therefore, become scarce over time. Our Cryptopolitan Price Prediction shows how the coin will gain value in the years to come.

Source: CoinStats According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December.

2025-05-28T16:42:09.000Z,"Cactus Custody and Chorus One Partner to Unlock the Future of Institutional Ethereum Staking","The post Cactus Custody and Chorus One Partner to Unlock the Future of Institutional Ethereum Staking appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Institutional interest in blockchain technology continues to rise and the demand for secure, efficient, and compliant staking solutions has become more urgent than ever. In response to this growing market, Cactus Custody , the institutional digital asset custodian under Matrixport, has partnered with staking infrastructure leader Chorus One to offer seamless Ethereum staking via ETH Vaults. This integration—now live on Cactus Link , Cactus Custody’s proprietary wallet extension—represents a significant step toward making advanced decentralized finance (DeFi) products accessible to institutional clients. With over $10 billion in digital assets under custody, Cactus Custody is doubling down on its commitment to provide cutting-edge blockchain tools while maintaining the highest standards of security and regulatory compliance. Through this partnership with Chorus One, institutions can now access high-yield staking opportunities with the simplicity and safety that a regulated custody provider offers. A New Era for Institutional ETH Staking The collaboration between Cactus Custody and Chorus One comes at a pivotal moment for Ethereum and the broader staking ecosystem. As Ethereum transitions into a mature proof-of-stake network, staking has become a fundamental mechanism for securing the blockchain and earning rewards. However, for institutions, navigating the complexities of staking—especially in a secure and compliant manner—has been a significant barrier. Chorus One’s ETH Vaults are now available through Cactus Link. These vaults offer streamlined access to Ethereum staking strategies tailored for institutions. The partnership removes friction from the staking process, allowing clients to participate in reward-generating opportunities without dealing with the operational burdens traditionally associated with staking infrastructure. Two standout offerings define this integration. First is the MEV Max vault, which utilizes Chorus One’s MEV-boost technology to optimize validator performance and maximize staking rewards—reportedly offering up to ~4% annual return. The second is Obol DV , a distributed validator technology (DVT) vault that not only provides Ethereum and MEV rewards but also offers incentives through the Obol Incentive Program. Both vaults are further enhanced by enabling the minting of osETH , a liquid staking token compatible with advanced DeFi and restaking strategies via Chorus’ Boost platform. For institutions, this means staking isn’t just passive yield—it’s now part of a broader, integrated investment strategy that includes liquidity, composability, and access to DeFi tools without compromising on custodial security. Secure Infrastructure Meets DeFi Agility At the heart of this integration is Cactus Link , a browser-based wallet extension specifically designed for institutional DeFi engagement. Supporting nearly 30 public blockchains—including Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, and Cosmos—Cactus Link empowers institutions to interact with decentralized protocols while maintaining robust safeguards like hardware-based signatures, Taproot support, and approval workflows. Unlike conventional retail wallets, Cactus Link removes mnemonic phrases and introduces institutional-grade transaction validation and auditing, ensuring compliance and operational oversight at every step. By embedding ETH Vaults into this infrastructure, Cactus Custody and Chorus One have created a unified environment where institutions can stake, earn, and manage digital assets with full confidence in both performance and security. As the crypto industry matures, the lines between traditional finance and decentralized ecosystems are beginning to blur. With the integration of Chorus One’s ETH Vaults into Cactus Link, Cactus Custody is offering a gateway for institutions to access Ethereum staking without sacrificing compliance, security, or usability.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/cactus-custody-chorus-one-partner-to-unlock-future-of-institutional-ethereum-staking/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY","Information",cryptocompare

2025-05-28T16:35:00.000Z,"Coinbase data breach 2025: What was stolen and what you need to know","Background of Coinbase’s May 2025 breach Coinbase, America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, received an unsolicited email from an unknown threat actor on May 11, 2025. They claimed to possess sensitive information about its customers and demanded a ransom of $20 million. Before examining the breach, it is interesting to understand how it happened at a public company that spends millions monthly on cybersecurity . In February, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported increased thefts involving Coinbase users. He blamed aggressive risk models and pointed out Coinbase’s failure to prevent $300 million in yearly losses from social engineering scams . A table ZachXBT shared on X showed $65 million stolen from users between December 2024 and January 2025. He also said the real losses could be higher, as his data only came from his direct messages about onchain thefts, and excluded Coinbase support tickets and police reports he couldn’t access. The fear of cybercriminals stealing valuable information came true on May 11 when Coinbase published a blog post confirming that account balances, ID images, phone numbers, home addresses and partially hidden bank details were stolen during the data breach. On May 21, the same threat actor swapped about $42.5 million from Bitcoin ( BTC ) to Ether ( ETH ) via THORChain. They used Ethereum transaction input data to write “L bozo,” following it with a meme video of NBA player James Worthy smoking a cigar, seemingly mocking ZachXBT, who later flagged the message on his Telegram channel. What happened: Timeline of the Coinbase breach The 2025 Coinbase breach wasn’t a typical crypto hack involving smart contracts or blockchain vulnerabilities. Instead, it was like a traditional IT security failure, marked by insider manipulation, corporate espionage and an extortion attempt. Below is a breakdown of how the incident unfolded: Insider recruitment and information theft began: To steal information from Coinbase, unknown cyber attackers began recruiting some overseas customer service agents (based in India) working for Coinbase. These insiders were paid to leak sensitive customer data and internal documentation, particularly that around customer service and account management systems. The stolen information was intended for future impersonation scams targeting users. Security detection and employee termination: Coinbase’s internal security team eventually detected suspicious activity linked to these employees. The involved staff were swiftly terminated, and the company alerted affected users. Though just 69,461 accounts were impacted, a fraction of Coinbase’s user base, the depth of stolen personal data made the breach significant. Extortion attempt via email (May 11, 2025): Coinbase received an unsolicited email claiming to possess internal system details and personally identifiable information (PII). This was later confirmed as credible in an 8-K SEC filing. Coinbase refuses to pay $20M ransom (May 14, 2025): Rather than accepting extortion, Coinbase flipped the script. The company reported the breach to law enforcement, disclosed it publicly and offered a $20 million reward for information leading to the attackers’ arrest, turning defense into offense. Breach disclosure and public notification: Shortly after the SEC filing, Coinbase publicly confirmed the breach, clarifying the scope and nature of the attack. A data breach notification was filed with the Maine Attorney General’s office, officially stating 69,461 users were affected. This timeline reflects how a crypto company responded differently to an attempted cyber-extortion, with transparency, resistance and bold countermeasures. This may bring in a change in the way companies respond to threats from cyber criminals. Did you know? North Korea’s Lazarus Group has stolen over $6 billion in crypto since 2017, including a record-breaking $1.46 billion from Bybit in 2025. What data was compromised in the Coinbase data breach in 2025? According to a notification letter issued by Coinbase, attackers sought this information because they planned to launch social engineering attacks. The information they stole could help them appear credible to victims and possibly convince them to move their funds. Coinbase detailed the information the threat actors had got access to and what they could not. What attackers got Name, address, phone, and email Government‑ID images (e.g., driver’s license, passport) Masked Social Security (last four digits only) Account data (balance snapshots and transaction history) Masked bank account numbers and some bank account identifiers Limited corporate data (including documents, training material, and communications available to support agents) What attackers couldn’t get Login credentials or 2FA codes Private keys Access to Coinbase Prime accounts Any ability to move or access customer funds Access to any Coinbase or Coinbase customer hot or cold wallets Did you know? In 2022, Crypto.com lost $30 million from 483 accounts. Initially, they claimed no funds were stolen, but later admitted the breach and refunded victims, highlighting the importance of transparency in crypto hacks. How Coinbase responded to the 2025 criminal data breach In response to the 2025 data breach, Coinbase implemented a comprehensive strategy to mitigate damage, support affected users and strengthen its security infrastructure. Key actions taken by Coinbase included: Refusal to pay ransom: Coinbase declined the $20 million ransom demanded by the attackers. Instead, the company established a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible. Customer reimbursements: The company committed to reimbursing customers who were deceived into sending funds due to the breach. Estimated costs for remediation and reimbursements range between $180 million and $400 million. Theft protection services: The company is providing all affected individuals with one year of complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services. This includes credit monitoring, a $1 million insurance reimbursement policy, identity restoration services, and dark web monitoring to detect if any personal information appears on illicit online platforms. Enhanced customer safeguards: Affected accounts will require additional ID verification for large withdrawals, including mandatory scam-awareness prompts to prevent further social engineering attacks. Strengthened support operations: Coinbase is opening a new support hub in the US. It has implemented stronger security controls and monitoring across all locations to prevent insider threats. Collaboration with law enforcement: The company is cooperating closely with US and international law enforcement agencies. Insiders involved in the breach were terminated and referred for criminal prosecution. Transparency and communication: Coinbase immediately notified affected customers once the breach was recognized. It is providing ongoing updates about the breach and the steps being taken to address it. These measures reflected Coinbase's commitment to customer protection and its proactive approach to cybersecurity challenges. Did you know? Crosschain bridges , like Nomad Bridge, lost $190 million in 2022 due to complex smart contract vulnerabilities. These bridges are hacker favorites because they store massive crypto assets, making them lucrative targets. How to stay safe in the event of Coinbase-like data breaches In the wake of large-scale data breaches of crypto platforms, you should take proactive steps to protect yourself from social engineering attacks. Here is how you could stay safe in such an event: Never share sensitive information with impersonators: Scammers often pose as support staff or security agents after a breach. They may push you toward moving funds to crypto wallets they share with you or revealing sensitive information under various texts. Never share your password, two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, or recovery phrases with such impersonators. No crypto exchange will ask you to transfer crypto to a “new” or “safe” wallet. Turn on allow-listing of wallet addresses: Some exchanges provide this feature, which restricts withdrawals to pre-approved wallet addresses you fully control. This prevents unauthorized transfers even if your account is compromised. Enable strong 2FA: For 2FA, use a hardware security key or a trusted authentication app. Avoid relying on SMS-based 2FA, which is vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks. Be cautious with unsolicited communication: Hang up immediately if someone calls claiming to be from a crypto platform and asks for security credentials or requests asset transfers. Do not respond to unknown texts or emails with your personal information. Lock first, investigate later: If anything feels suspicious, lock your account immediately through the app or platform and report the incident to customer support via official channels. Stay informed: Regularly review security tips and updates from your crypto services to recognize and avoid evolving scam tactics.",cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/coinbase-data-breach-2025-what-was-stolen-and-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION","Coinbase",cryptocompare

2025-05-28T16:25:56.000Z,"U.S. Labor Department Picks Up Crypto Torch, Throws Out Previous Warnings","The U.S. Department of Labor is reversing its earlier caution about including crypto investments in people's retirement savings, arguing that issuing warnings about the hazards of digital assets failed to maintain appropriate neutrality about what the agency tells investment officials. The new compliance directive issued on Wednesday clarified that the department has no business singling out assets for warnings or praise, though the move tracks with months of actions from the administration of President Donald Trump to throw out impediments to digital assets investment. Trump has said he's seeking to be the crypto president. “The Biden administration’s Department of Labor made a choice to put their thumb on the scale,” Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a statement. “We’re rolling back this overreach and making it clear that investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not D.C. bureaucrats.” The department under President Joe Biden had advised so-called 401(k) plan decisionmakers that crypto may be overly risky to count on for retirement planning. \""The department has serious concerns about the prudence of a fiduciary's decision to expose a 401(k) plan's participants to direct investments in cryptocurrencies, or other products whose value is tied to cryptocurrencies,\"" it said in the March 2022 compliance release . \""These investments present significant risks and challenges to participants' retirement accounts, including significant risks of fraud, theft, and loss.\"" The warning came a few months before the industry leapt into a buzzsaw of shocking failures in which big names such as Celsius Network and Voyager Digital collapsed, leading to the sector-shaking disintegration of top global exchange FTX under a cloud of fraud accusations. Retirement investments in bitcoin BTC, for instance, would have slid about 52% over the 12 months following the Labor Department's notice. However, the assets have since climbed, and an investment made on the day of the warning would now be up a considerable 156%. In 2023, California-based 401(k) provider ForUsAll sued the DOL in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., alleging the agency didn't follow the proper rules in issuing the guidance. Under Trump, agencies including the Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have reconsidered their crypto stance and, in some cases, have begun reversing previous policy. When running for a seat in the House of Representatives, Chavez-DeRemer also received $1.5 million in backing from crypto super PAC Fairshake, though she ultimately lost her race before Trump tapped her for the Labor secretary position. As the government seeks to make a sharp turn on the assets, Trump and his family have personally embraced the industry for their own business interests. The president recently attended a dinner thrown for the top investors in his own memecoin, and Trump Media the Trump-tied World Liberty Financial are pursuing significant crypto moves even as the president's administration considers how it'll oversee such businesses. Trump's business ties have been raised as a central sticking point for U.S. legislation to establish guardrails for stablecoin issuers.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/05/28/u-s-labor-department-picks-up-crypto-torch-throws-out-previous-warnings,"BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|EXCHANGE|REGULATION","Policy|Department of Labor|Regulation|401(k)|Retirement|Donald Trump|News",cryptocompare

2025-05-28T16:07:04.000Z,"SWIFT Uses R3 Corda to Settle Payments Using XRP","In a revelation that is sending ripples across the blockchain and global payments landscape, prominent crypto influencer SMQKE has reported on X that SWIFT, the world’s leading interbank messaging system, is now leveraging R3 Corda’s blockchain platform to settle payments using XRP. This development, while long speculated in blockchain circles, marks a potentially transformative convergence between the centuries-old financial messaging giant and cutting-edge distributed ledger technology (DLT), positioning XRP at the heart of global payment infrastructure. The Intersection of SWIFT, R3 Corda, and XRP SWIFT , formally known as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, is the backbone of international banking communication, connecting over 11,000 financial institutions across more than 200 countries. Traditionally, SWIFT has only handled the messaging layer of cross-border transactions — the actual money settlement still takes days due to intermediaries, reconciliations, and liquidity bottlenecks. Blockchain technology, with its promise of near-instant settlement and transparency, has long been eyed as the key to modernizing this outdated system. SWIFT using R3 Corda to settle payments using XRP. pic.twitter.com/zkzExHU4Ib — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 27, 2025 Enter R3 Corda, a leading enterprise blockchain platform designed to facilitate secure, direct transactions between financial institutions. Unlike public blockchains like Ethereum or Bitcoin, Corda is designed for enterprise use, enabling private and permissioned transactions that meet stringent regulatory and privacy standards. Importantly, R3, the consortium behind Corda, has maintained a longstanding relationship with Ripple, the company behind XRP, and has developed capabilities for XRP settlement within its ecosystem. SMQKE’s post draws attention to what appears to be the formal integration of these elements: SWIFT using R3 Corda’s blockchain network as a settlement layer, with XRP acting as the digital asset bridging currency. This combination — SWIFT’s vast reach, Corda’s enterprise-grade DLT, and XRP’s speed and liquidity — could reshape the flow of international payments. Why XRP Is Central to This Integration XRP has always stood out among digital assets due to its design as a bridge currency for cross-border payments . Unlike Bitcoin, which is often compared to digital gold, or Ethereum, which serves as a base layer for decentralized applications, XRP’s primary use case is to facilitate fast, low-cost transfers of value between disparate currencies. RippleNet, Ripple’s global payments network, already uses XRP in its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) corridors, eliminating the need for pre-funded nostro-vostro accounts and unlocking trapped capital for financial institutions. With SWIFT reportedly now tapping into this ecosystem through R3 Corda, XRP’s utility appears to be expanding significantly. Instead of merely operating within Ripple’s proprietary network, XRP could now serve as a settlement asset across the vast SWIFT network, potentially powering real-time cross-border transactions between thousands of banks. This elevates XRP from a niche liquidity solution to a crucial component of the global financial system. Implications for Global Payments The integration of SWIFT, Corda, and XRP could have seismic implications for the future of global payments. Firstly, settlement times could plummet from several days to mere seconds, dramatically improving the efficiency of international trade, remittances, and capital flows. Banks and corporations would benefit from reduced operational costs, minimized counterparty risk, and enhanced liquidity management. The use of XRP, a neutral digital asset, reduces the need for correspondent banking networks that typically rely on dominant reserve currencies such as the US dollar and euro. This could democratize access to efficient cross-border payments, especially for emerging markets and smaller financial institutions that often face prohibitive costs in the current system. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Thirdly, by leveraging R3 Corda’s permissioned blockchain, SWIFT can offer a high degree of privacy and regulatory compliance — two critical concerns for the conservative financial industry — while still harnessing the benefits of public digital assets such as XRP. This hybrid model blends the best of both worlds: the speed and innovation of crypto, with the security and oversight of traditional finance. A Long-Awaited Milestone For years, the crypto community has speculated about when — or if — SWIFT would embrace blockchain technology in a meaningful way. While SWIFT has conducted DLT trials, the move to settle payments with XRP via R3 Corda is one of the most substantial and impactful steps taken so far. It signals not just an experiment, but a potential production-level deployment that could redefine how value moves across borders. Moreover, this development places XRP at the forefront of institutional-grade blockchain adoption, countering narratives that its utility was limited to Ripple’s network. It reinforces XRP’s position as a neutral, highly liquid settlement asset and offers new momentum for its broader adoption by financial institutions worldwide. Looking Ahead As the global financial system continues to evolve under the pressure of technological innovation, partnerships and integrations like the one reported by SMQKE are critical markers of where the future is headed. The marriage of SWIFT’s entrenched network, R3 Corda’s enterprise blockchain, and XRP’s digital liquidity creates a powerful trifecta capable of transforming cross-border payments at scale. While the details of the implementation and rollout timeline remain to be fully disclosed, the significance of this development cannot be overstated. It represents a major leap forward for blockchain’s role in mainstream finance and underscores the growing recognition of XRP as a key player in the emerging digital economy. In the coming months, market watchers, financial institutions, and crypto enthusiasts alike will be closely monitoring how this integration unfolds — and whether it paves the way for a new era of faster, cheaper, and more inclusive global payments.

While strengthening the expectation of a new record rise, Tom Lee, the co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, known for his bold predictions for Bitcoin, announced his new expectation for Bitcoin. Tom Lee, who shared from the X account, said that Bitcoin is about to enter the banana zone phase where it has high growth potential. Lee used analysis shared by Julien Bittel, head of macro research at Global Macro Investor, in his forecast. According to Bittel’s chart, Bitcoin has gone through four major market cycles since 2011. And each cycle consists of two correction phases before entering a period of rapid growth called “banana territory.” According to the shared chart, the current cycle started in 2022 and is currently experiencing its first correction. The second correction is occurring within the banana zone. If history repeats itself and the cycle continues in the same way, Bitcoin could be on the verge of a major rise.

2025-05-28T16:00:42.000Z,"Trump Backs Bill To Buy 1 Million Bitcoin — Lummis Reveals When","The opening day of the Bitcoin 2025 conference delivered an unmistakable political signal: President Donald Trump has thrown his weight behind legislation that would require the United States to accumulate a strategic reserve of one million bitcoin. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis disclosed the White House commitment during a policy-heavy session on the conference’s main stage, flanked by Senators Marsha Blackburn and Jim Justice. Lummis Sets Timeline For Bitcoin Bill “President Trump supports the bill and he has a team in the White House working on digital-asset issues — everything from stablecoins to market structure to the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve — and they will probably roll out in that order,” Lummis said , bringing “the BITCOIN Act to the attention of the American people and the world.” The sequencing matters. Lummis confirmed that the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act cleared the Senate Banking Committee before the Memorial Day recess. “We’re getting close to being ready to have it on the floor,” she told the audience, noting that weeks of bipartisan negotiations produced a text the minority party could accept. “We should be voting on it the week we get back from this break. Then we’ll do market structure, and then we’ll do the Bitcoin strategic reserve.” Modeled on the way Fort Knox anchors US gold holdings, the revised BITCOIN Act — first introduced in July 2024 and re-filed on 11 March 2025 — authorises the Treasury to purchase up to one million BTC over five years using “budget-neutral” mechanisms already available to the Federal Reserve and the Exchange Stabilization Fund. At Wednesday’s spot price of roughly $108,900, the position would be valued at about $108.9 billion, equal to 2.6 percent of the FY 2025 discretionary budget. Lummis framed the reserve as both an energy and a security imperative. “When China forbade mining of Bitcoin, they did the United States a big favor because a lot of those mining operations came here,” she said, echoing Trump’s recent call to make “Bitcoin mining and America conjoined.” Pairing domestic hash-rate dominance with federal accumulation, she argued, would give Washington a “geopolitical advantage.” That view, she added, is shared by senior uniformed officers. “I’ve talked to generals in our military who understand that economic power is as important as military power in addressing aggressors around the world — and there are generals … who are big supporters of having a strategic Bitcoin reserve for that reason.” State-level momentum is reinforcing the federal push. Arizona, Texas and New Hampshire enacted their own strategic-reserve statutes this year, and lawmakers in another thirty jurisdictions debated similar measures. “The states are where the innovation is occurring,” Lummis said, positioning local initiatives as policy laboratories that can be rapidly scaled. Abroad, the United Arab Emirates is building exposure through US-listed spot ETFs, while the Czech National Bank is studying BTC as a reserve diversifier. “That’s good for America because they’re going to build their sovereign wealth in Bitcoin through an American ETF,” she added. Although the White House on March 7 issued an executive order directing agencies to lay groundwork for a federal Bitcoin stockpile, only Congress can appropriate funds or modify debt-management statutes — a hurdle the BITCOIN Act is designed to clear. With the stablecoin framework poised for a floor vote in early June and market-structure legislation queued behind it, Lummis told delegates to remain mobilised. “At that time we’ll be calling on you to help members of Congress in your states understand the importance,” she said, underscoring the tight legislative calendar before the August recess. For now, the path to a trillion-satoshi reserve runs through the Senate cloakrooms. But the political optics are shifting: a sitting president has endorsed federal Bitcoin accumulation, the Pentagon is quietly blessing the concept, and three US states have already legislated partial blueprints.

2025-05-28T16:00:15.000Z,"Dogecoin Flashes Buy Signal – Key Indicator Hints At Rebound","Dogecoin is currently trading around critical levels, consolidating just below the key $0.25 resistance zone. After a period of relative calm, momentum is beginning to build as bullish sentiment returns to the altcoin market. With Bitcoin holding near all-time highs and Ethereum pushing higher, analysts are calling for the start of a long-awaited altseason—and Dogecoin is showing early signs of participation. Related Reading: Ethereum Nears Critical Price Level – Reclaiming $3,000 Would Spark A Market-Wide Rally Price action has remained constructive, with DOGE defending higher lows and gradually tightening within a key range. Now, traders are closely watching for a breakout above the $0.25 level, which could unlock the next phase of upside. Adding to the optimism, top analyst Ali Martinez shared a technical signal worth noting: the TD Sequential indicator has flashed a buy signal on Dogecoin’s hourly chart. Historically, this pattern has preceded short-term rebounds and local trend reversals, especially when confirmed near key support zones. As sentiment improves and capital begins rotating into high-beta altcoins, Dogecoin appears well-positioned for a potential move. If bulls can push through resistance and validate the TD signal with follow-through volume, DOGE may quickly retest higher levels last seen during early-year surges. The coming sessions could be pivotal. Dogecoin Consolidates As Buy Signal Hints At Incoming Breakout Dogecoin is showing signs of renewed strength, consolidating within a key range between $0.21 and $0.25. After a powerful surge of over 90% since early April, DOGE has cooled off slightly, but remains firmly within bullish territory. The recent price action has been marked by steadily higher lows and a tightening range structure, suggesting that the asset is gearing up for its next major move. The $0.25 resistance remains a critical level to watch. A confirmed breakout above this zone could open the door to a more aggressive rally and shift market sentiment decisively in favor of the bulls. However, momentum has slowed in recent days, and global macroeconomic uncertainty—particularly surrounding inflation and interest rate expectations—continues to weigh on risk assets across the board. Despite these challenges, optimism persists. Martinez recently pointed to a TD Sequential buy signal that has appeared on the 1-hour chart for Dogecoin. This indicator, known for predicting trend reversals and short-term impulses, tends to be particularly effective when it flashes during consolidation phases like the current one. If confirmed, the signal could provide the spark needed to push DOGE back toward the $0.25 resistance—and potentially beyond. For now, bulls must continue to defend the $0.21 support level while looking for momentum to build above the current range. If broader market conditions remain favorable and DOGE can reclaim $0.25 with volume, a new leg higher may follow. Until then, the setup remains constructive, with strong technical support and early signals pointing toward a possible breakout. Related Reading: Solana Funding Rates Turn Negative – Early Sign Of Selling Pressure? DOGE Consolidates Below Resistance Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at $0.222, consolidating after a strong rally in early May. The chart shows price holding within a tight range between $0.21 and $0.25, with the $0.25 level acting as strong resistance. Despite recent pullbacks, DOGE continues to trade above its key moving averages, signaling that bullish structure remains intact in the short term. The 34 EMA (green) at $0.2112 is providing dynamic support, while the 50 SMA (blue) at $0.1929 reinforces a solid base just below. The 200 SMA (red), currently at $0.2714, is the next significant resistance if DOGE breaks out above $0.25. Volume has decreased slightly during this consolidation, a typical sign of a market pausing before a potential breakout or breakdown. The lack of aggressive selling pressure suggests that bulls are still in control, but need renewed momentum to challenge and reclaim the $0.25 level.

A clean break and close above $0.25 would likely confirm the continuation of the bullish trend, potentially targeting the $0.28–$0.30 range.

2025-05-28T15:59:15.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Trades In The Red As Price Action Remains Subdued","Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to reclaim $110,000 after a quiet start to the week. The flagship cryptocurrency registered a marginal increase on Memorial Day but fell back in the red on Tuesday after briefly crossing $110,000. BTC is trading around $109,050, with the price marginally down over the past 24 hours. Analysts believe BTC risks a pullback to $100,000 if it fails to reclaim $110,000 and falls out of its bullish channel. However, they also state that the broader outlook around the asset remains positive. US May Buy More Bitcoin White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks suggested the US may be open to buying more Bitcoin to expand its reserves if it can be done in a budget-neutral way. Sacks discussed the Trump administration’s aggressive push to reshape US crypto policy, including years of perceived hostility towards digital assets. Speaking with Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Sacks highlighted the Trump administration’s pro-Bitcoin actions, including the establishment of a Strategic Digital Asset Reserve, and indicated the reserve could be expanded, stating, “If it can be done in a budget-neutral way—specifically if either the Commerce Department or the Treasury Department can figure out how to fund it without adding to the debt, then they are allowed to create those programs.” President Trump signed an executive order that stated the reserve would be funded by Bitcoin held by the US Department of the Treasury, forfeited during civil and criminal proceedings. However, Sacks believes the executive order allows the US government to purchase more Bitcoin. “So if we can convince Howard Lutnick, who's Commerce Secretary, or Scott Besson, who's the Treasury Secretary, to buy some, and they can figure out how to fund it—without a new tax or adding to the debt, maybe by finding the money from some other program that's not using it—then we could potentially acquire more Bitcoin.” Bitcoin Rally Could Liquidate $7B In Short Positions Bitcoin (BTC) briefly crossed $110,000 on Tuesday after the US equities market opened strongly, and the Trump Media and Technology Group announced plans to raise $2.5 billion for a Bitcoin treasury. BTC’s momentum aligns with favorable macroeconomic conditions, with the National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) shifting to ultra-loose territory after a tightening phase in February 2025. The NFCI tracks the stress in the financial system by aggregating measures like credit spreads, leverage, and funding conditions. When it moves into looser territory, it indicates easier access to capital and reduced market stress. For assets like Bitcoin, such movements typically align with price rallies as capital flows into risk and speculative assets. According to the Econometrics newsletter, liquidity has returned to the market, creating a favorable macroeconomic environment for assets like Bitcoin. “That’s the kind of macro backdrop where Bitcoin thrives. Bitcoin’s rally to new highs didn’t come out of nowhere. It’s tracking the same pattern we saw since 2023: easing conditions → capital rotation → risk-on.” Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Firm Despite Monumental Rally Unlike previous market cycles, long-term Bitcoin holders are in no hurry to sell. On-chain data has revealed a lack of selling despite substantial profit potential. This indicates a conviction among long-term investors that the price will continue to push higher. Real Vision analyst Jamie Coutts stated that the LTH-SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) indicator is one of the most obvious indicators of this resilience. “While MVRV and NUPL measure the potential for profit-taking, LTH-SOPR captures when that potential is realized—when long-term holders actually move coins to lock in gains or cut losses. At previous tops, the signal has been clear: LTH-SOPR hit 17 in 2017, 8 in 2021, and 4.3 in Q1 2024. Today, it sits at 2.1. Bitcoin has rallied over 47% from the lows and reached new all-time highs—yet long-term holder selling remains muted.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin's (BTC) price action has been subdued this week as it struggles to reclaim $110,000. The flagship cryptocurrency registered a marginal increase on the memorable day holiday but declined on Tuesday after briefly crossing $110,000. Analysts believe BTC faces the risk of a pullback and a drop to $100,000 if it fails to reclaim $110,000. Additionally, Bitfinex analysts have warned that more liquidations could follow if BTC drops below $108,000. Total crypto liquidations hit $211 million on Tuesday, of which $131 million were long positions, compared to a little over $79 million in short positions. Bitunix analysts have interpreted this imbalance as evidence of a long-side wipeout during BTC’s recent drop to $108,000 and have cautioned investors against entering overly aggressive long positions while BTC trades near this level. “Short-term attention should be paid to the effect of support at $108,500–$109,000, and it is not recommended to chase higher. Analysts advise observing whether the $110,800–$112,000 pressure band is effectively broken before considering further positions.” The analysts stated that a drop below this level could trigger more liquidations and lead to a price breakdown. “A drop below $108,000 could trigger a new round of liquidations. Traders are advised to exercise strict risk control as the market could weaken again if capital inflows do not resume.” BTC registered a marginal decline on Saturday (May 17), settling at $103,235. The price rebounded on Sunday, rising over 3% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,489. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $102,135 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,572, ultimately registering a drop of nearly 1%. BTC recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.21% to $106,854. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as the price registered an increase of 2.57% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,603. BTC raced to a new all-time high on Thursday, rising to $111,970 before registering a marginal decline and settling at $111,582. Source: TradingView However, price action turned bearish on Friday thanks to renewed trade war concerns. As a result, BTC dropped nearly 4% to $107,356. The price recovered over the weekend, rising 0.46% on Saturday and 1.15% on Sunday to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,095. BTC registered a marginal increase on Monday but was back in the red on Sunday, dropping 0.46% to $108,951 after briefly crossing $110,000. The current session sees BTC down over 1%, trading around $107,843. A decline from current levels could see the price test the $100,000 support level.

2025-05-28T15:49:00.000Z,"It’s Going to Be Wild for Bitcoin: Lightspark CEO Explains Why","A supply shock is on the horizon for Bitcoin, with its scarce nature and growing demand serving as a major catalyst for the impending wild rally. Lightspark CEO and co-founder David Marcus knows what’s coming for Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap. In a May 27 tweet , he suggested that things are going to get “so wild” from here on for the premier crypto asset.Scarcity Is RealMarcus identified a growing story of Bitcoin adoption among major financial players. The asset’s demand has gone institutional, so much so that Marcus has lost count of the number of companies racing to accumulate Bitcoin.An interesting detail of this strong demand is that Bitcoin is a scarce resource. The 21-million-capped asset, widely known as digital gold, already has 94.6% of its total supply in circulation. With depleting exchange reserves and increased accumulation by firms and long-term holders, Bitcoin’s supply is nearly extinguished.Meanwhile, Marcus highlighted that only 1.4 million Bitcoin tokens will be created in the next 115 years. For context, estimations show that miners will mint the last Bitcoin by 2140, precisely 115 years from now. At the current mining rate of 450 BTC per day, it would have taken less time to mine the last Bitcoin. However, due to the pre-programmed halving event , scheduled to occur periodically up to 2136, the issuance rate of the pioneering cryptocurrency would continue to decline, adding to its scarcity.As a result, the Lightspark CEO noted that it is going to be wild for Bitcoin. The growing institutional acquisition of Bitcoin, combined with the limited available supply, would spark a supply shock and, consequently, a price explosion.For perspective, several market enthusiasts have tipped Bitcoin to continue to grow due to the escalating adoption. Standard Chartered has predicted $200,000 by year’s end, Cathie Wood says $1.5 million by 2030 , and Michael Salylor projected an ambitious $13 million by 2045.Firms Are Massively Accumulating BitcoinIn truth, companies are buying Bitcoin in no small amounts. Some use part of their reserve, others leverage growing interest from the legal financial sector to borrow funds and increase exposure, and others acquire using the Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Either way, institutions are becoming aware and stacking the priced digital asset.For instance, Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has been incessantly piling into Bitcoin, leveraging corporate notes and common share offerings to raise funds. It currently holds 580,250 BTC, valued at $62.87 billion.Next, firms like Metaplanet and Marathon Digital are also employing a similar strategy as MicroStrategy to fund Bitcoin purchases. The former holds 7,800 BTC ($843 million), and the latter has 48,137 BTC ($5.2 billion).Meanwhile, GameStop , Semler Scientific, and The Blockchain Group are also actively buying Bitcoin. Remarkably, all three are leveraging Strategy’s playbook, offering users indirect exposure to Bitcoin as a business intelligence firm.In the Bitcoin ETF space, some prominent names are also gaining exposure to Bitcoin. Firms such as Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Avenir Group, Barclays Bank , and Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala, hold investments in several spot ETFs, thereby indirectly acquiring Bitcoin.Meanwhile, other notable companies are also teasing the creation of a Bitcoin treasury. Trump Media announced yesterday that it would raise $2.5 billion to acquire Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/05/28/its-going-to-be-wild-for-bitcoin-lightspark-ceo-explains-why/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=its-going-to-be-wild-for-bitcoin-lightspark-ceo-explains-why,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Market|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare

2025-05-28T15:46:55.000Z,"Bitcoin Pulls Back to $107K, but NYDIG Analysis Suggests Market Far From Overheated","Wednesday morning U.S. hours saw a modest acceleration in crypto's pullback from the recent big move higher, with bitcoin BTC stumbling nearly 2% to just above the $107,000 level. Altcoins fared worse, with XRP XRP, solana SOL and dogecoin DOGE among those sporting declines in the 3%-5% range. Among crypto-related stocks, the bitcoin miners were hardest hit, with MARA Holdings (MARA), Riot Platforms (RIOT) and Hut 8 (HUT) each lower by nearly 10%. Bitcoin treasury companies were also showing sizable losses, led by GameStop (GME), down 11% after announcing the purchase of just over 4,710 bitcoin (or about $500 million at the current price) — to some a rather underwhelming amount considering the company raised $1.3 billion for bitcoin acquisition several weeks ago. Cycle over? Bitcoin's roughly 50% rally from the post-early April bottom to a new record high of $112,000 last week has more than a few market participants suggesting 2021-like signs of froth. Not so fast, said the research team at NYDIG . First off, they note, bitcoin has rallied about 7X from the November 2022 low in the $15,000 area — a nice move for sure, but far behind peak-to-trough moves of 452X in 2013, 112X in 2017 and 20X in 2021. While bitcoin is a far more mature asset today than in the past and even a 20X move might seem a bit steep, the numbers still suggest a decent amount of further upside. The team also looked at Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV), which compares the current total market cap of all bitcoins to their aggregated value based on the last time each coin moved. It's current at 2.4X, far below prior peaks, including 2021's top of 4.0X. \""While these are all just rough benchmarks, they suggest there’s still meaningful upside potential for bitcoin,\"" concluded NYDIG.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/28/bitcoin-pulls-back-to-107k-but-nydig-analysis-suggests-market-far-from-overheated,"BTC|DOGE|MARKET|SOL|ZRX","Markets|Bitcoin|market analysis|News",cryptocompare

Norwegian digital asset company K33 became the latest firm to join the Bitcoin (BTC) train. On Wednesday, May 28, the company announced it secured 60 million Swedish krona, worth about $5.6 million, for its Bitcoin treasury. To fund the acquisition, the Oslo-headquartered company, which is listed on Nasdaq First North in Stockholm, issued 150.56 million new shares worth 15 million SEK. K33 also issued 301.12 million free warrants valued at 45 million SEK. According to the company, the capital comes from insiders and aligned investors, including Klein Group and Modiola AS. Free warrants are zero-interest instruments that investors can later convert into equity at the same price. If converted before March 2026, investors are entitled to additional free warrants at the same conversion rate. If fully exercised, the warrants would allow K33 to raise an additional 75 million SEK, approximately $7.1 million.

This move comes as the video game retailer seeks to leverage the increasing global adoption of crypto. The company’s filing did not specify the exact timeframe of these Bitcoin acquisitions.Despite Bitcoin’s short-term price fluctuations, GameStop’s decision highlights its commitment to the crypto firstborn as a treasury reserve asset, following approval by its board earlier this year.Treasury Reserve Plans and Funding SourcesGameStop’s board unanimously approved adding Bitcoin to its treasury reserves in March. According to the quarterly filing, the company plans to allocate some of its cash or proceeds from future debt or equity issuances toward Bitcoin purchases. However, it did not disclose the maximum amount of Bitcoin it might acquire.Notably, GameStop gained widespread attention in 2021 due to a surge in its stock driven by a Reddit community called WallStreetBets. The retail investors behind this movement pushed shares up nearly 2,000% in less than a month.GameStop’s Bitcoin acquisition mirrors recent moves by major market players in the crypto space. Notably, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has made significant Bitcoin purchases as part of its treasury management strategy, even attracting other public companies and jurisdictions. Other Corporate and Institutional Bitcoin AcquisitionsStrategy, recognized as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, itself increased its stake by adding 4,020 BTC this week.

This statement follows Ripple’s gift of the skull of Satoshi to the Bitcoin community. Garlinghouse said , “ I hope this gesture continues to remind folks that we (BTC, XRP, and other crypto communities) have more in common than we think.” Special guest at Bitcoin 2025 – the Skull of Satoshi, donated by @Ripple to the Bitcoin community. The Skull will now have a permanent home at the Bitcoin Museum in Nashville. pic.twitter.com/Eo3kNqRvGp — The Bitcoin Conference (@TheBitcoinConf) May 28, 2025 For a long time, Garlinghouse has viewed XRP as a competitor of Bitcoin. His excuse for not overtaking BTC was the SEC case, especially under Biden’s administration. Early this year, he was against the SBR, citing that other crypto coins should also be considered. He said, “Maximalism remains the enemy of crypto progress, and I’m very glad to see fewer and fewer folks ascribe to this outdated and misinformed thinking.” Luckily for him, Trump has considered XRP a digital stockpile. However, BTC is at the very front with a market cap of over $2 trillion, while XRP is at the fourth position with a market cap of over $130 billion. Garlinghous asserts he owns the three big crypto assets, including Bitcoin. Meanwhile, the BTC conference has quickly become one of the year’s defining events for the crypto industry. It hosted over 30,000 attendees, 300 exhibitors, and a packed lineup of speakers. Garlinghouse calls for attention to blockchain energy usage Garlinghouse said, “ The Skull of Satoshi was originally built to call attention to blockchain energy usage, and today it’s a symbol and reminder of Bitcoin’s incredible staying power to many around the world (including me!).” The statement sounds sarcastic because, in recent years, Bitcoin has used around 57.09 billion kWh per year. This is comparable to electricity usage in countries like Argentina or the Netherlands. On the other hand, XRP uses 474,000 kWh, a fraction of the energy used by Bitcoin. Compared to Bitcoin, XRP’s energy consumption is 100,000 times smaller than Bitcoin’s per transaction. Meanwhile, BTQ and Quandela have agreed to look into how photonic quantum computing can be used for BTQ’s Quantum Sampling Proof-of-Work (QSPoW). It is an alternative to Bitcoin’s standard safe mining model that uses less energy. Users question XRP’s decentralized nature The public nature of the payments firm has raised an interlinked question of Ripple’s centralized leadership and XRP’s supposed decentralized model. A user asked on X why Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is the face of XRP, given XRP’s claim to being a decentralized crypto asset. “I don’t see the same arrangement with BTC,” they said. Chief Technology Officer of Ripple, David Schwartz, jumped in right away to calm people down and give a full explanation. Schwartz brought up the fact that Garlinghouse is the CEO of the company Ripple. But “XRP has no issuer,” adding that all XRP tokens were made when the XRP Ledger first came out. The CTO of the payments company also talked about decentralization, which is one of the most important ideas in the crypto world. Schwartz also said that people worried about XRP Ledger’s decentralized model should focus less on meanings and more on what they want from decentralization.

The eight-hour chart shows that BERA price is hovering near its all-time low of $2.70, forming a double-bottom pattern. A double bottom is one of the most bullish reversal signs in technical analysis. However, BERA remains below its 50-period and 100-period moving averages. While the double-bottom pattern may suggest a potential relief rally, a drop below $2.7021 would invalidate the bullish case and could open the door to further downside, potentially targeting the psychological level of $2.50.

This move could make crypto assets a standard component of American retirement portfolios, potentially unlocking access to over $7 trillion in retirement savings.2022 Guidance ReversedThe original 2022 compliance release advised fiduciaries to exercise extreme caution when considering crypto investments, citing concerns about volatility, custody, and the speculative nature of crypto assets. This departed from the DOL’s historically neutral stance and was criticized as bureaucratic overreach.The department’s latest action, announced on May 28, 2025, officially rescinds that guidance. It now reaffirms a neutral position, neither endorsing nor discouraging the inclusion of crypto in retirement plans by fiduciaries.Labor Secretary Slams Biden-Era Policy as ‘Overreach’Lori Chavez-DeRemer, confirmed as U.S. Labor Secretary in March, expressed disapproval of the prior administration’s approach to labor and investment policy. She criticized what she described as excessive government interference under the Biden Administration and emphasized that fiduciaries, not federal officials, should make investment decisions.Her remarks reflect the Trump administration’s broader pivot toward crypto-friendly policies and reinforce growing confidence in the legitimacy of digital assets.In April, the U.S. Federal Reserve withdrew key supervisory guidance on crypto, granting banks more freedom to engage with Bitcoin and other crypto assets. This policy shift ends the requirement for advance notice or special approval for crypto-related activities.Additionally, the Fed, FDIC, and OCC jointly retracted earlier warnings about crypto risks, pivoting toward standardized oversight. Now, the Department of Labor has joined this trend of regulatory easing for crypto.Bitcoin at $111K: Timing Favors Crypto InclusionThe timing couldn’t be more favorable. Bitcoin recently reached a new all-time high of $111,970 in 2025.

Since then, it has experienced daily net inflows except May 13, when it recorded zero flows. Several significant intraday netflow surges contributed to the $9 billion milestone during this period. Specifically, on April 23, IBIT brought in $643.16 million in a single day. Five days later, on April 28, the ETF witnessed its highest single-day inflow of the year at $970.93 million. Interestingly, Bitcoin's price on April 28 only showed a modest increase of 1.36%, closing at $95,000, indicating that institutional appetite for exposure to Bitcoin via the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF remained strong irrespective of the price action.Meanwhile, the momentum continued into May. On May 2, the ETF drew in another $674.91 million. Later in the month, on May 22, it recorded an inflow of $877.18 million, outpacing VOO , the largest ETF by AUM. Most recently, on May 27, IBIT attracted an additional $409.26 million in net inflows, leading to the $72.4 billion in total assets.IBIT Now 23rd Among Largest ETFsReacting to the impressive performance, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas spotlighted IBIT's stunning rise. He highlighted that IBIT's current AUM of $72 billion places it among the top 25 largest ETFs in the world, specifically at the 23rd position. https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1927718185127604580He also pointed out the extraordinary nature of this achievement given that the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF is only a year old. The next youngest ETF within the top 25 is the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG), which launched back in October 2012. With its current AUM, the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF has now surpassed the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP), which holds $72.1 billion in assets. However, IBIT still has significant ground to cover to break into the top 10 ETFs. To reach that milestone, it would need to exceed the Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND), which currently ranks 10th with $126.8 billion in AUM. This means IBIT would require an additional $54.6 billion in net assets to secure a top-10 position.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/05/28/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-now-23rd-among-largest-etfs-balchunas-says-next-youngest-etf-in-top-25-is-12yrs-old/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=blackrock-bitcoin-etf-now-23rd-among-largest-etfs-balchunas-says-next-youngest-etf-in-top-25-is-12yrs-old,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Market|Bitcoin ETF|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today|Latest BlackRock News Updates Today",cryptocompare
2025-05-28T15:35:24.000Z,"Best crypto to buy as Trump Media plans $2.5B investment in Bitcoin","Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the parent company of the Truth Social platform, announced a plan to invest $2.5 billion in Bitcoin. US President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance and his push for his meme coin have attracted investor attention to the space. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) , a meme coin, is expected to gain momentum from this push for meme coins. More companies get into BTC for diversification TMTG said it will raise the funds by selling $1.5 billion worth of stock and $1 billion in convertible notes. The bitcoin investment is a part of the company’s long-term strategy to diversify its revenue streams and align with the growing trend of corporate crypto holdings. This massive investment comes at a time when a number of companies are turning to Bitcoin and other digital assets in an effort to hedge against inflation and traditional market volatility. Enterprise software firm Strategy has so far bought $40.6 billion worth of Bitcoin. The company is the biggest corporate holder of Bitcoin. Strategy’s shares have surged as Bitcoin’s value jumped in the last couple of years. Videogame retailer GameStop also revealed that it bought $513 million worth of bitcoin. Trump Media’s move is also consistent with Donald Trump’s increasingly visible engagement in the alternative investment space. In 2025, Trump launched the Trump coin, a meme coin that capitalized on his political brand. Although initially dismissed as a novelty, the token saw significant speculative activity, especially among Trump’s base and crypto enthusiasts. How Bitcoin Pepe is poised to become the next big thing Bitcoin Pepe has already raised $11.9 million, two days before its CEX (centralized exchange) listing. The cryptocurrency is a meme-driven layer 2 solution built on the Bitcoin network that aims to combine the best of Bitcoin’s settlement guarantees with Solana’s lightning-fast scalability. BPEP has garnered attention for its innovative approach to combining meme culture with Bitcoin’s robust security. At its core, Bitcoin Pepe introduces the PEP-20 token standard, aiming to bring the efficiency and speed of platforms like Solana to the Bitcoin network. This fusion allows for rapid, retail-friendly trading experiences while leveraging Bitcoin’s unparalleled security. The project’s strength lies not only in its technological innovation but also in its strategic partnerships. Bitcoin Pepe has also collaborated with platforms like Super Meme and Catamo to facilitate safe and fair meme coin launches, while integrations with Plena Finance and GETE Network expand Bitcoin Pepe’s utility in the DeFi and gaming sectors. Bitcoin Pepe’s explosive returns With the token price currently at $0.0377, Bitcoin Pepe has already provided cumulative gains of more than 79% to its early investors who bought at $0.0210. With Bitcoin Pepe’s price jumping 5.2% and 4.9% respectively in the previous two stages, the meme coin is set for more gains as it comes closer to its listing. Investors looking for the next crypto that has the potential to be a multi-bagger and missed out on previous crypto assets are said to be eyeing Bitcoin Pepe. As more companies buy into Bitcoin to diversify their financial assets, Bitcoin Pepe, an emerging meme coin, is gearing up to become the next big hit in the cryptocurrency world.

2025-05-28T15:35:19.000Z,"Crypto Whale James Wynn’s $87M Portfolio Wiped Out in 5 Days: A Detailed Recap","TL;DR James Wynn – an industry participant known across the digital asset space for his high-risk leverage trades – became the latest rock star of crypto by making some jaw-dropping trades before the latest Lookonchain update revealed a total wipe-out. In a twist, an anonymous trader profited $5.6M in three days by consistently taking the opposite side of his trades. The Adventures of Wynn Earlier this month, he entered a long BTC position with roughly $390 million. The bet initially had a liquidation price of $96,600 and a margin of just south of $10 million. In the following days, Wynn increased the position to a whopping $1.25 billion with 40x leverage. At one point, the trader was at the crest of the wave, standing at the staggering $87 million in unrealized profit due to BTC’s price rally above $110,000. However, towards the end of last week, the asset’s valuation (and the entire cryptocurrency market) retraced following Donald Trump’s threat to impose tariffs of 50% on the European Union, effective from June 1. Logically, the downtrend wiped out a significant chunk of Wynn’s gains. He then flipped bearish on the asset, opening a short position of 1,038 BTC at $107,711 with a liquidation price of $149,100. Eventually, the trader called it quits , closing all contracts with a profit of $25 million. The whale’s actions were praised by many X users, with some calling him a “legend.” Others, though, have not been so kind, wishing to see him in the red. Wynn prepared a special post for those stating: For all my haters out there who so very much loved to see my portfolio swing down by $60,000,000. Just know, now you get to see it swing BACK UP INTO THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS. I repeat HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS. Money that haters like you can’t even dream of having because… pic.twitter.com/VnFo6i5bhT — James Wynn (@JamesWynnReal) May 27, 2025 The blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain revealed that just a few hours after announcing the profit, the trader “was back in the casino” and continued to long BTC with 40x leverage. “The portion size reaches 684 BTC ($75.34M), and the liquidation price is $103,120,” the entity stated on May 26. Subsequently, Wynn increased his long position to 5,676 BTC, with a liquidation price of $108,010. Besides interacting with BTC, Wynn is known as a proponent of PEPE and opened several positions involving the asset. Back in the day, he spent $182,000 to purchase 7.2 trillion tokens. He sold 6.76 trillion PEPE for almost $34 million and left 443.7 billion PEPE (worth over $6 million at current rates). Lookonchain revealed that Wynn had been actively trading the meme coin on Hyperquid lately, making four profitable trades that netted $25.4 million. The platform later estimated that the whale deposited 240 billion PEPE into Binance, raising the question of whether he was preparing to cash out. Shortly after, the entity disclosed that it seemed like Wynn had sold the stash to fund his long BTC position and informed that he deposited the remainder of his PEPE holdings into the exchange. Betting Against Wynn and Big Loss The whale executed his whopping long and short positions on the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid, and these trades were visible to other market participants. Lookonchain revealed the case of one savvy trader who bet against Wynn’s actions and, in just three days, made $5.6 million. Specifically, they shorted BTC every time Wynn went long and vice versa. On May 24, trader 0x2258 opened a short position in BTC and ETH and closed it the following day, realizing a profit of $1.36 million. Then, Wynn opened a BTC short position, while the other trader went long on BTC and ETH, only to make a profit of $2.54 million on May 26. Finally, the unknown industry participant opened short positions on the two cryptocurrencies, generating a profit of $1.7 million ( at least on paper). Some speculated that the mysterious trader might be Wynn operating from another account to hedge his bets. However, the whale rejected the rumors, saying : “Not happy with this post at all. Whoever trader 0x2258 is, it is not me and have no clue who it is . I only trade on one HL account and that’s public. Don’t start spreading fake news with zero proof.” The most recent Lookonchain update, though, paints a painful picture for the whale. It reads that it took him 70 days to build the aforementioned $87 million portfolio (at its peak) but only five days to lose almost all of it. James Wynn( @JamesWynnReal ) has wiped out almost all his profits on #Hyperliquid . It took him 70 days to go from 0 to $87M+ in profit, and only 5 days to lose almost all the $87M+ in profit. https://t.co/IUTpCuzoSB pic.twitter.com/n2p3nftZ3G — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 28, 2025 The post Crypto Whale James Wynn’s $87M Portfolio Wiped Out in 5 Days: A Detailed Recap appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-whale-james-wynns-87m-portfolio-wiped-out-in-5-days-a-detailed-recap/,"BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|ZRX|PEPE","BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|PEPE",cryptocompare

2025-05-28T15:23:14.000Z,"Expert Sets Bullish Price Target, Says XRP Will Pump Without Warning","The XRP community is once again charged with excitement following a bold price prediction from prominent crypto analyst JackTheRippler. In a recent post on X, JackTheRippler shared a chart forecasting that XRP could surge dramatically, reaching between $28 and $30 by October 2025. His message was clear and emphatic: XRP is going to pump without any warning. This assertion has captured the attention of both seasoned investors and new entrants in the crypto space, reigniting debates about XRP’s long-term potential and its readiness to break free from years of regulatory headwinds and price stagnation. But what’s fueling this sudden wave of optimism, and how realistic is this bullish projection? #XRP IS GOING TO PUMP WITHOUT ANY WARNING! pic.twitter.com/Nd6UVBqYv9 — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) May 28, 2025 Decoding the Bullish Sentiment Around XRP JackTheRippler’s forecast isn’t appearing in a vacuum. The bullish sentiment surrounding XRP has been gradually building, especially with recent developments around the Ripple-SEC lawsuit. The legal clarity has enabled Ripple to ramp up its operations, focusing on regions with crypto-friendly regulatory frameworks. At the same time, institutional interest in Ripple’s payment solutions — particularly its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service — has been expanding across global corridors, including Latin America, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. These developments position XRP not just as a speculative asset but as a key player in the evolving global payments infrastructure. The Road to $28–$30: Can XRP Realistically Hit These Targets? JackTheRippler’s price target of $28–$30 is undeniably ambitious. At current valuations, such a surge would represent an astronomical increase, placing XRP’s market cap into territory usually reserved for the very top echelon of global assets. For context, XRP has historically hovered in the $0.50 to $1.50 range over the past few years, even during periods of heightened market activity. However, the crypto markets are no strangers to explosive, seemingly unpredictable rallies. Assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum have repeatedly defied expectations, posting massive gains during bullish cycles that were once thought impossible. For XRP, several catalysts could propel it toward JackTheRippler’s bold target: the mass adoption of Ripple’s payment solutions, deeper institutional integration, increased regulatory clarity, and the possibility of major partnerships or even central bank digital currency (CBDC) collaborations built on the XRP Ledger. Importantly, the phrase “without warning” underscores the often volatile and sudden nature of crypto market movements. Although fundamentals are important, the crypto market has repeatedly demonstrated that sentiment, hype, and speculation can propel prices to astonishing heights, particularly when limited supply meets rapid demand growth. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Reaction and Market Dynamics Within the XRP community, JackTheRippler’s prediction has sparked both excitement and caution. His supporters highlight his proven track record of accurate analysis, citing his technical charts that frequently identify crucial resistance and breakout points. Skeptics, however, caution that such dramatic targets should be taken with a grain of salt, emphasizing the importance of measured, long-term investment strategies over hype-fueled chasing. Regardless of where one stands, it’s clear that XRP is entering a phase of renewed attention. Investors are closely monitoring macroeconomic trends, regulatory developments, and Ripple’s business moves, as these factors could impact XRP’s future performance. With Bitcoin’s next halving cycle already setting the stage for a broader crypto bull run, XRP could well be poised to ride the wave, potentially validating JackTheRippler’s bold claim that the pump will come swiftly and without warning. JackTheRippler’s latest bullish call on XRP has injected fresh energy into the market, with his prediction of a $28–$30 price target by October 2025 igniting both enthusiasm and debate. While such projections are certainly ambitious, they reflect the persistent belief among XRP advocates that the asset’s true potential has yet to be unlocked. As Ripple continues to expand its global reach and XRP gains further utility in cross-border payments, a sudden and dramatic price surge remains a possibility. Whether or not XRP hits JackTheRippler’s lofty target, one thing is certain: in the fast-moving world of crypto, transformative moments often arrive when least expected — and XRP investors are watching closely.

Analyst Evaluates!","Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new ATH after its rally last week, but then entered a consolidation period. While analysts generally expect the uptrend to continue, one analyst noted that Bitcoin could retest the $94,000 support amid market consolidation. Keith Alan, co-founder of trading resource Material Indicators, said in his latest analysis that Bitcoin has correction potential and could test $94,000. Keith Alan said that whales continue to accumulate and Bitcoin consolidates above $100,000. Stating that this situation supports the bullish outlook in BTC, Alan said that there is also a possibility of correction. If sellers temporarily regain control, the downside target could be around the 21-week moving average of $94,000, the analyst said. “We are in a bull market and the trend is upward, but in trading it is not always bullish. Only going up is a myth. Consecutive green candles of 7 and above are rare. If this occurs, this green period is usually followed by periods of consolidation or correction. Currently, BTC is consolidating above $100,000 and whales are accumulating. While the outlook is bullish, there is a possibility that Bitcoin could face a correction. If a correction does occur, Bitcoin would face support at $94,000, which currently coincides with the 21-Week Moving Average. So, in case of a BTC correction, I expect a test of $94,000.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Is Bitcoin Next for a New Record or a Correction?

2025-05-28T16:35:00.000Z,"Coinbase data breach 2025: What was stolen and what you need to know","Background of Coinbase’s May 2025 breach              Coinbase, America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, received an unsolicited email from an unknown threat actor on May 11, 2025. They claimed to possess sensitive information about its customers and demanded a ransom of $20 million. Before examining the breach, it is interesting to understand how it happened at a public company that spends millions monthly on cybersecurity. In February, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported increased thefts involving Coinbase users. He blamed aggressive risk models and pointed out Coinbase’s failure to prevent $300 million in yearly losses from social engineering scams. A table ZachXBT shared on X showed $65 million stolen from users between December 2024 and January 2025. He also said the real losses could be higher, as his data only came from his direct messages about onchain thefts, and excluded Coinbase support tickets and police reports he couldn’t access. The fear of cybercriminals stealing valuable information came true on May 11 when Coinbase published a blog post confirming that account balances, ID images, phone numbers, home addresses and partially hidden bank details were stolen during the data breach.On May 21, the same threat actor swapped about $42.5 million from Bitcoin (BTC) to Ether (ETH) via THORChain. They used Ethereum transaction input data to write “L bozo,” following it with a meme video of NBA player James Worthy smoking a cigar, seemingly mocking ZachXBT, who later flagged the message on his Telegram channel.                  What happened: Timeline of the Coinbase breach              The 2025 Coinbase breach wasn’t a typical crypto hack involving smart contracts or blockchain vulnerabilities. Instead, it was like a traditional IT security failure, marked by insider manipulation, corporate espionage and an extortion attempt.Below is a breakdown of how the incident unfolded:Insider recruitment and information theft began: To steal information from Coinbase, unknown cyber attackers began recruiting some overseas customer service agents (based in India) working for Coinbase. These insiders were paid to leak sensitive customer data and internal documentation, particularly that around customer service and account management systems. The stolen information was intended for future impersonation scams targeting users.Security detection and employee termination: Coinbase’s internal security team eventually detected suspicious activity linked to these employees. The involved staff were swiftly terminated, and the company alerted affected users. Though just 69,461 accounts were impacted, a fraction of Coinbase’s user base, the depth of stolen personal data made the breach significant.Extortion attempt via email (May 11, 2025): Coinbase received an unsolicited email claiming to possess internal system details and personally identifiable information (PII). This was later confirmed as credible in an 8-K SEC filing. Coinbase refuses to pay $20M ransom (May 14, 2025): Rather than accepting extortion, Coinbase flipped the script. The company reported the breach to law enforcement, disclosed it publicly and offered a $20 million reward for information leading to the attackers’ arrest, turning defense into offense. Breach disclosure and public notification: Shortly after the SEC filing, Coinbase publicly confirmed the breach, clarifying the scope and nature of the attack. A data breach notification was filed with the Maine Attorney General’s office, officially stating 69,461 users were affected. This timeline reflects how a crypto company responded differently to an attempted cyber-extortion, with transparency, resistance and bold countermeasures. This may bring in a change in the way companies respond to threats from cyber criminals.Did you know? North Korea’s Lazarus Group has stolen over $6 billion in crypto since 2017, including a record-breaking $1.46 billion from Bybit in 2025.                   What data was compromised in the Coinbase data breach in 2025?              According to a notification letter issued by Coinbase, attackers sought this information because they planned to launch social engineering attacks. The information they stole could help them appear credible to victims and possibly convince them to move their funds.Coinbase detailed the information the threat actors had got access to and what they could not. What attackers gotName, address, phone, and emailGovernment‑ID images (e.g., driver’s license, passport)Masked Social Security (last four digits only)Account data (balance snapshots and transaction history)Masked bank account numbers and some bank account identifiersLimited corporate data (including documents, training material, and communications available to support agents)What attackers couldn’t getLogin credentials or 2FA codesPrivate keysAccess to Coinbase Prime accountsAny ability to move or access customer fundsAccess to any Coinbase or Coinbase customer hot or cold walletsDid you know? In 2022, Crypto.com lost $30 million from 483 accounts. Initially, they claimed no funds were stolen, but later admitted the breach and refunded victims, highlighting the importance of transparency in crypto hacks.                  How Coinbase responded to the 2025 criminal data breach              In response to the 2025 data breach, Coinbase implemented a comprehensive strategy to mitigate damage, support affected users and strengthen its security infrastructure.Key actions taken by Coinbase included:Refusal to pay ransom: Coinbase declined the $20 million ransom demanded by the attackers. Instead, the company established a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.Customer reimbursements: The company committed to reimbursing customers who were deceived into sending funds due to the breach. Estimated costs for remediation and reimbursements range between $180 million and $400 million.Theft protection services: The company is providing all affected individuals with one year of complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services. This includes credit monitoring, a $1 million insurance reimbursement policy, identity restoration services, and dark web monitoring to detect if any personal information appears on illicit online platforms.Enhanced customer safeguards: Affected accounts will require additional ID verification for large withdrawals, including mandatory scam-awareness prompts to prevent further social engineering attacks.Strengthened support operations: Coinbase is opening a new support hub in the US. It has implemented stronger security controls and monitoring across all locations to prevent insider threats.Collaboration with law enforcement: The company is cooperating closely with US and international law enforcement agencies. Insiders involved in the breach were terminated and referred for criminal prosecution.Transparency and communication: Coinbase immediately notified affected customers once the breach was recognized. It is providing ongoing updates about the breach and the steps being taken to address it.These measures reflected Coinbase's commitment to customer protection and its proactive approach to cybersecurity challenges.Did you know? Crosschain bridges, like Nomad Bridge, lost $190 million in 2022 due to complex smart contract vulnerabilities. These bridges are hacker favorites because they store massive crypto assets, making them lucrative targets.                  How to stay safe in the event of Coinbase-like data breaches              In the wake of large-scale data breaches of crypto platforms, you should take proactive steps to protect yourself from social engineering attacks. Here is how you could stay safe in such an event:Never share sensitive information with impersonators: Scammers often pose as support staff or security agents after a breach. They may push you toward moving funds to crypto wallets they share with you or revealing sensitive information under various texts. Never share your password, two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, or recovery phrases with such impersonators. No crypto exchange will ask you to transfer crypto to a “new” or “safe” wallet. Turn on allow-listing of wallet addresses: Some exchanges provide this feature, which restricts withdrawals to pre-approved wallet addresses you fully control. This prevents unauthorized transfers even if your account is compromised. Enable strong 2FA: For 2FA, use a hardware security key or a trusted authentication app. Avoid relying on SMS-based 2FA, which is vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks. Be cautious with unsolicited communication: Hang up immediately if someone calls claiming to be from a crypto platform and asks for security credentials or requests asset transfers. Do not respond to unknown texts or emails with your personal information. Lock first, investigate later: If anything feels suspicious, lock your account immediately through the app or platform and report the incident to customer support via official channels. Stay informed: Regularly review security tips and updates from your crypto services to recognize and avoid evolving scam tactics.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/coinbase-data-breach-2025-what-was-stolen-and-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-28T15:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the industry’s most overlooked asset","Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin DepotA new proposal to install Bitcoin ATMs in federal buildings highlights an important question: Can crypto truly go mainstream without a stronger physical presence? For years, the industry has focused on software and decentralization, but its reluctance to invest in real-world infrastructure is starting to show. Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be.Everyone loves to talk about decentralization. There’s a good reason behind this. It defines the movement, shapes the technology, and supports the vision of a better financial system. While the industry focuses on code and algorithms, it lacks something basic. A decentralized system that exists only online is not genuinely decentralized.Physical infrastructure is the missing linkBitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the missing link. Without tools like ATMs, kiosks and access points at traditional retail locations, crypto remains out of reach for millions. Decentralization is not just about removing intermediaries. True decentralization requires expanding access. Without real-world touchpoints, even the most advanced network becomes limited to a closed circle of insiders.Recent: Arizona governor kills two crypto bills, cracks down on Bitcoin ATMsFor crypto to become mainstream, it must be easy to reach digitally and physically. That means showing up in places people already go and seamlessly integrating into people’s lives. Many groups in the American population still rely on cash or don’t have access to traditional banks. According to the latest Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation report, around 5.6 million American households don’t have a bank or savings account. Bitcoin ATMs give these users access without needing an app, a bank account or a crash course in blockchain. Most crypto tools today assume a level of financial fluency and infrastructure that millions simply do not have. The result is a digital-only ecosystem that locks out newcomers and widens the divide between early adopters and everyone else.User-friendly screen in the right placePhysical infrastructure helps address this issue. A Bitcoin ATM in a grocery store or gas station is not just a convenience but a bridge to financial inclusion. It is an invitation to someone who has never bought crypto, telling them they can participate. No bank, no broker, just a user-friendly screen in a familiar place.These machines also generate new economic activity. Local businesses benefit from increased foot traffic as the kiosks create passive revenue. For many communities, they provide access to a parallel financial system that was previously out of reach. This is a tangible example of crypto’s real-world utility. It is already happening, and it is measurable.The crypto industry’s blind spotThe industry often treats physical infrastructure like an afterthought. The obsession with building new digital solutions has created a blind spot. Innovation without usability builds systems that serve the few but exclude the many. If someone can buy Bitcoin (BTC) at the same place they buy their morning coffee, that is when crypto stops feeling like an obscure digital asset and starts becoming part of everyday life.As governments increase regulation, trusted and transparent interfaces will become more important. When operated within regulatory frameworks, Bitcoin ATMs offer a way to provide access between traditional finance and digital assets. They are familiar, easy to monitor and offer a more approachable entry point for the general public.Like any financial tool, Bitcoin ATMs have drawn scrutiny, particularly in cases where bad actors use them. Rather than dismissing the machines themselves, we should focus on investing in better oversight, stronger consumer education and smarter regulation. The overwhelming majority of people who use Bitcoin ATMs do so for legitimate reasons: to send remittances, to move money securely or to access digital assets without traditional banking barriers. Building trust does not mean avoiding or dismantling physical access, but improving it.The first time someone uses Bitcoin should not involve reading a white paper or navigating a tutorial. It should be as familiar as using an ATM or tapping a payment terminal. This is not an argument against innovation. Software and protocols will continue to evolve and play an important role. Physical infrastructure provides something those tools cannot: trust through presence. When people can see and use crypto in their neighborhood, at a store they already visit or in a format they already understand, it changes how they think about crypto and who it is for. According to Coin ATM Radar, there are over 30,000 Bitcoin ATMs in the US. It’s a meaningful start, but still only a small step toward widespread access. Crypto’s long-term success will depend not just on innovation but also on inclusion. That means building more than networks; it means building presence. When people can interact with crypto in the physical world, it stops being abstract and becomes usable. That is how digital finance becomes everyday finance.Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin Depot.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Source: EY-ParthenonInstitutional participation in DeFi is set to triple over the next two years to 75% from 24% of 350 surveyed institutional investors, according to management consulting firm EY-Parthenon.To tackle the growing institutional liquidity needs, Katana’s liquidity pool is composed of multiple protocols, including lending protocol Morpho, decentralized exchange (DEX) Sushi and perpetual DEX Vertex, enabling users to trade “blue-chip assets” without needing crosschain transfers.Katana has also incorporated Conduit’s sequences and Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network.Related: Polygon CEO: DeFi must ditch hype for sustainable liquidityKatana to compound DeFi yield from “Ethereum-based opportunities”Katana aims to boost sustainable yield by building a cohesive DeFi ecosystem. For instance, VaultBridge deploys bridged assets into overcollateralized, curated lending strategies on Ethereum via Mopho to earn yield, which is routed back and compounded on Katana.The protocol will reinvest network fees and a portion of application revenue back into its ecosystem.“This reduces reliance on short-term incentives, generates consistent yield, and as it grows, acts as an increasingly stable backstop during periods of volatility and liquidity shocks,” Polygon Labs’ Boiron told Cointelegraph, adding:“Yield is distributed pro-rata to each chain using VaultBridge protocol based on their share of total deposits into VaultBridge.”“So if Katana supplies 20% of the total vault deposits, it receives 20% of the yield back,” he added.Katana will subsequently allocate its share of yield to users through boosted DeFi incentives across “core apps” such as Sushi, Morpho or Vertex. The yield is generated from “Ethereum-based opportunities and then enhanced through Katana’s core applications,” said Boiron.Polygon Labs’ CEO previously criticized DeFi protocols for fueling a cycle of “mercenary capital” by offering sky-high annual percentage yields (APYs) through token emissions. Beyond infrastructure-related limitations, regulatory uncertainty remains another significant barrier to institutional DeFi adoption.2025 Institutional Investor Digital Assets Survey.

2025-05-28T14:15:00.000Z,"Elderly crypto investors are getting scammed: Teach them these key safety tips","Why are seniors being targeted in crypto scams?              Scammers prey on seniors because they view them as financially secure, trusting and less familiar with rapidly evolving technology.Let’s understand why seniors are key targets.Perception of wealth: Many older adults have retirement savings or pensions, making them lucrative targets.Lower tech fluency: Navigating crypto wallets, private keys and blockchain concepts can be intimidating, something scammers exploit.Embarrassment prevents reporting: Victims often feel ashamed, making them less likely to report the crime.Crypto is irreversible: Once funds are sent via Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, there’s no reversing the transaction. That’s a dream scenario for scammers.According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), seniors report growing losses linked to cryptocurrency investment fraud, romance scams and government impersonation. In South Carolina’s Beaufort County alone, seniors reported over $3.1 million in crypto scam losses in 2024.And these scams are becoming more sophisticated. AI tools can now clone voices, spoof caller IDs and create fake websites that mimic legitimate exchanges or financial institutions to steal from unsuspecting seniors.                  Examples of crypto scams targeting older adults              From crypto romance fraud in Cambodia targeting British pensioners to ATM scams in Minnesota and impersonation schemes across the US, scammers have stolen millions by preying on older adults’ trust and unfamiliarity with digital assets.1. Cambodian scam compounds exploiting British pensionersIn Bavet, Cambodia, scam compounds operated by networks linked to the Chinese mafia have been uncovered. These operations enslave trafficked workers, forcing them to participate in romance and cryptocurrency fraud. British pensioners have been prime targets, suffering significant losses.. One victim from the West Midlands lost over 250,000 British pounds ($340,000). These scams often employ “pig-butchering” tactics, cultivating trust online before executing large-scale financial fraud.2. Crypto ATM scams in MinnesotaIn Minnesota, over 5,500 incidents involving cryptocurrency kiosks led to losses exceeding $189 million in 2023. Seniors were the most vulnerable victims, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the stolen funds. Scammers often direct victims to transfer funds using QR codes tied to fraudulent accounts. Cities like Stillwater have implemented bans on crypto ATMs to protect residents.3. Romance scam targeting a disabled woman in the UKLisa Nock, a 44-year-old woman from Staffordshire with autism and mobility issues, fell victim to a romance scam after being targeted on Instagram by someone impersonating Australian TV vet Dr. Chris Brown. Over 18 months, the scammer manipulated her into transferring £11,000 in cryptocurrency, claiming the funds were for flights, visas and hiring a substitute vet. Lisa eventually realized the deceit and reported the fraud to authorities.4. Government or bank impersonators demanding crypto paymentsScammers may impersonate the IRS, Social Security Administration, Medicare or local law enforcement. Their script is simple: You’re in legal trouble or owe back taxes, and the only way to avoid arrest or penalties is to pay in Bitcoin.This tactic has been used across the US. In South Carolina, a retired healthcare worker named Marianne was told she missed jury duty and owed $7,500. Following fake sheriff’s instructions, she fed the cash into a Coinstar crypto ATM, which instantly converted her money to Bitcoin and sent it straight to scammers.5. Ohio woman loses life savings in cryptocurrency investment scam An Ohio woman lost her life savings in a cryptocurrency investment scam that defrauded victims of about $4.9 million. The scheme involved 33 identified victims nationwide, with five more accounts under FBI investigation.Did you know? A $243 million Bitcoin heist involving a fake Google call spiraled into a real-world kidnapping plot straight out of a Netflix thriller.                  7 Key safety tips every elderly crypto investor should know              Elderly investors should follow key safety steps like never sending crypto to strangers, verifying suspicious contacts, enabling two-factor authentication, avoiding public WiFi and discussing large transactions with trusted family before acting.Here are the key safety tips every elderly crypto investor should be aware of:Never send crypto to strangers: If someone you’ve never met in person asks for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies,  it’s almost certainly a scam. This includes social media, messages on Facebook, emails from supposed tech support or even someone you’ve been chatting with on a dating site. No legitimate person or organization will randomly ask for crypto. If you’re being told, “Send me $500 and I’ll send back $1,000,” you’re being conned. Always assume unsolicited crypto requests are fraudulent.Double-check all contacts: If you get a call, email, or text from a bank, the IRS or even a family member in crisis, don’t respond immediately. Call the official number on your bank card or government website to verify.Use trusted wallets and exchanges only: Stick to platforms with strong security and regulation like Coinbase, Kraken and Binance.US. Avoid apps from unknown websites or links in emails.Watch for pressure tactics: Scammers thrive on urgency; you only have two hours to pay; act now to claim your prize. Real financial institutions do not use this kind of pressure.Set up two-factor authentication (2FA): All crypto wallets and exchange accounts should have 2FA enabled. This adds a second layer of protection even if a password is stolen.Avoid public WiFi for crypto transactions: Never send crypto or log in to financial apps over public WiFi at coffee shops, airports or hotels. These networks are often unsecured and can be intercepted by hackers. Use your home WiFi or mobile data instead, and ensure your device has up-to-date antivirus protection.Talk to family before big transactions: Before sending large amounts of crypto or any money, have a quick conversation with someone you trust. Scammers often isolate victims and make them feel they must act alone. Encourage seniors to adopt a simple rule: If it’s more than $100, talk to someone first. A five-minute phone call could prevent a five-figure mistake.                  Think grandma got scammed? Here’s what to do immediately              If you’ve been scammed, act fast: Report it to the crypto exchange (they might freeze the funds), file a fraud report with the FTC or Chainabuse and contact elder support services for guidance and protection.1.

David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA, said the agency aims to support innovation while ensuring market trust:“At the FCA, we have long supported innovation that benefits consumers and markets. At present, crypto is largely unregulated in the UK. We want to strike a balance in support of a sector that enables innovation and is underpinned by market integrity and trust.”The FCA also noted it will work with the UK’s central bank to regulate stablecoins. Bank of England Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden said, “For those stablecoins that expect to operate at systemic scale, the Bank of England will publish a complementary consultation paper later this year.”Related: UK outpaces global crypto ownership growth in 2025: Gemini reportEnsuring stablecoins remain stableThe FCA said that its rules “aim to ensure regulated stablecoins maintain their value.” The regulator said customers must be clearly informed about how the backing assets are managed. It also recommended that stablecoin issuers appoint independent third-party custodians to hold reserve assets:“We propose to require issuers to provide holders with the right to redeem qualifying stablecoins at par value with the reference currency, irrespective of the value of the backing assets portfolio, with a payment order placed to an account in the name of the holder at the latest by the end of the business day following receipt of a valid request.“Breeden added that the FCA’s proposals are part of a broader effort to build the UK’s stablecoin regime.Related: UK to require crypto firms to report every customer transactionCrypto custody rules incomingThe FCA’s proposals also introduce new requirements for firms providing crypto custody services, as outlined in a separate discussion paper.

It marks the first monthly sales increase since the start of the year, suggesting renewed interest in digital collectibles. This follows a five-month decline in sales since volume peaked at over $900 million in December 2024. May also had the highest number of transactions in 2025, reaching 5.5 million, according to CryptoSlam. The sales uptick could also be attributed to the divergence between unique NFT buyers and unique NFT sellers. NFT buyers continued to increase in May, while sellers declined. Chart compiled by Cointelegraph to demonstrate CryptoSlam data on NFT monthly sales.

In May, NFT sellers fell to around 284,600, the lowest amount recorded on the CryptoSlam platform since April 2021. The divergence between the growing buyer interest and shrinking seller activity could set the stage for more competitive bidding, which may lead to higher valuations. Chart compiled by Cointelegraph to demonstrate CryptoSlam data on NFT buyers and sellers.

These include AnchorZero, a platform helping crypto founders use Roth IRAs for tax advantages, and Spark Capital, a new venture focused on stablecoin infrastructure.Other portfolio companies include Ethena, ClearToken, Crossover Markets, Station70 and Theo — an onchain trading infrastructure project that recently raised $20 million from 17 different VC firms.The company plans to eventually back up to 30 companies with early-stage rounds ranging from $500,000 to $1 million.Metalayer was co-founded by Chainlink Labs’ former head of growth, Mickey Graham, and former Two Sigma executives Andy Kangpan and David Winton.Winton developed a proprietary data platform called Moirai to help Metalayer analyze developer activity, protocol engagement and blockchain transaction patterns to uncover promising projects. “Moirai is our internal sourcing engine for identifying early-stage crypto startups,” Graham told Cointelegraph in a written statement. “The platform is designed to help us systematically surface high-quality startups, and it evaluates opportunities across several key dimensions,” he said.Related: VC Roundup: 8-figure funding deals suggest crypto bull market far from overCrypto VC deals on the rise, but there’s a catchCrypto venture capital activity saw a notable uptick in the first quarter, with increases in both total funding and deal volume, according to data from Galaxy Digital. VC funding reached $4.9 billion during the quarter, though nearly half came from a single deal — Binance, which raised $2 billion from MGX, an investment firm backed by a United Arab Emirates sovereign wealth fund.Despite the outsized impact of the Binance deal, overall market activity showed signs of improving. A total of 446 crypto funding deals were recorded in Q1, marking a 7% increase from the previous quarter.Crypto VC deals remain considerably lower than the peak of the previous bull market. Source: GalaxyNevertheless, venture capital investors remain cautious about making fresh commitments to the sector, according to Robert Lee, a senior analyst at PitchBook. The first quarter was a challenging market environment as a sharp correction in crypto prices compounded investor reluctance.In an interview with Bloomberg last month, Lee noted that many venture capital firms are still on the sidelines. “[M]any of the funds from the last cycle have yet to deliver meaningful DPI,” he said, referring to the private equity metric Distributed to Paid-In Capital, which measures how much capital has been returned to investors relative to what they invested.Metalayer’s Mickey Graham believes that at least some of this drop-off is due to a much-needed transition happening beneath the surface:“We believe the crypto industry has crossed the chasm from an early market defined by infrastructure-building to a mainstream technology sector characterized by the deployment of blockchain technology throughout the global economy.”Although VC activity remains subdued compared to past bull cycles, Kadan Stadelmann, the chief technology officer of the Komodo Platform, told Cointelegraph that the industry has seen an “uptick in mergers and acquisitions, suggesting market maturation.”Stadelmann indicated that pro-crypto regulations in the United States and European Union, “have given large institutions confidence to continue making investments into crypto firms.”At a geographic level, the US accounted for more than a third of total crypto VC deals in 2024 — a trend expected to continue this year.

Could this technical setup, coupled with the SEC’s review of a spot XRP ETF application by WisdomTree, signal the start of a rally to $3.40 and higher?XRP falling wedge pattern targets $3.40From a technical perspective, XRP (XRP) price could gain significant momentum if it breaks out of this falling wedge pattern.In technical analysis, a falling wedge is a bullish reversal chart pattern that comprises two converging trend lines that connect lower highs and lower lows. This convergence indicates a weakening downward momentum. XRP price is currently retesting the resistance provided by the upper trendline of the wedge at $2.42.

Revenue from derivatives increased by 40%, reflecting increased interest from clients seeking crypto-based risk-management tools.The bank also said it invested in building a proprietary digital platform last year, aiming to serve business-to-consumer (B2C), business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-business-to-consumer (B2B2C) clients.The system, expected to launch later this year, will feature API-based infrastructure to handle increasing demand across markets.Mike Foy, chief financial officer at AMINA Bank, said the bank’s liquidity coverage ratio increased to 228% in 2024, up from 219% in 2023.“In addition, our CET1 capital ratio, which compares a bank’s capital against its risk-weighted assets, is more than double the regulatory requirement at 34%, despite an increase in risk-weighted assets as a result of our expansion,” Foy added.Related: Crypto projects prepare to battle for privacy in SwitzerlandAMINA’s international revenue growsAMINA also noted that its international revenue continues to increase, with income from its Abu Dhabi operations rising 150% year-over-year and Hong Kong posting 570% growth.

2025-05-28T09:59:06.000Z,"Fungible cryptos in secondary sales are not securities, Ripple tells SEC","Ripple, the blockchain company behind XRP, argued that fungible cryptocurrencies are not securities when transferred in secondary transactions in a recent letter sent to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).In its May 27 letter, Ripple cited US attorney and crypto law thought leader Lewis Cohen to support its claim. In his widely cited 2022 paper, “The Ineluctable Modality of Securities Law: Why Fungible Crypto Assets Are Not Securities,” he wrote:“[T]here is no current basis in the law relating to ‘investment contracts’ to classify most fungible crypto assets as ‘securities’ when transferred in secondary transactions.”In his paper, Cohen explained that in secondary transactions, an investment contract transaction is generally not present. He further claimed that fungible cryptocurrencies “neither create nor represent the necessary cognizable legal relationship between” a legal entity and the holder that is the “hallmark of a security.”Related: Banking groups ask SEC to drop cybersecurity incident disclosure ruleSEC’s “new paradigm”Ripple also referenced SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce's May 19 “new paradigm” speech. She said she’d been voicing her dissent with the regulator’s approach to crypto, adding:“Having emerged from the crypto dissent years, I am glad to be able speak to you today as the head of the Commission’s Crypto Task Force about a rational and coherent path forward and a new paradigm at the SEC.”Peirce said that the SEC’s “approach to crypto in recent years has evaded sound regulatory practice and must be corrected.” She also said that most cryptocurrencies are not securities, adding:“Most currently existing crypto assets in the market are not [securities]. My supplemental answer is that economic realities matter and non-security crypto assets may be distributed as part of an investment contract, which is a type of security.”Ripple’s long fight with the SECThe SEC had viewed a large portion of digital assets as securities, with the regulator’s former chair, Gary Gensler, stating in 2023 that most of the crypto market falls under the securities bracket. This stance led to a protracted legal battle between the SEC and Ripple.The lawsuit first began at the end of 2020, when the SEC took action against Ripple and its executives, claiming that XRP sales constituted unregistered security offerings. Still, after the government’s stance on crypto changed with the election of current US President Donald Trump, Ripple has mostly won the battle, with the SEC recently dropping its appeal against a ruling favorable to the company.In its recent letter to the SEC, Ripple also cited a ruling in the case noting that “the court held that certain of Ripple’s historical institutional sales of XRP were investment contracts,” while the secondary sales were not. Furthermore, the judge “determined that XRP itself is not a security.”Magazine: XRP win leaves Ripple and industry with no crypto legal precedent set",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-sec-letter-crypto-not-securities?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-28T02:11:48.000Z,"Real-world assets could revitalize dying NFT lending market: DappRadar","Real-world assets linking up with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is one of a few key catalysts that could reignite the waning NFT lending sector, which is suffering from a collapse in volumes and user activity, says blockchain analytics platform DappRadar.Volumes in the NFT lending market, which allows NFT holders to take out a loan against their token, have dropped 97% from a peak of around $1 billion in January 2024 to $50 million in May, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a May 27 report.Gherghelas said for NFT lending to “move beyond survival mode,” it needs “new catalysts” to reignite the sector, such as real-world asset NFTs, like tokenized real estate or yield-bearing assets that could unlock more stable, trusted collateral sources.“So far, 2025 has not delivered a compelling reason for NFT lending to bounce back,” she said. “While the infrastructure is still here and the platforms remain active, activity has slowed across the board.” Borrower and leading activity have taken a big hit in the NFT lending sector. Source: DappRadar“For now, the sector seems to be in a holding pattern, waiting either for market recovery or a new use case to reignite interest.”Gherghelas added that other catalysts that could rekindle NFT lending were tools that make it easier for NFT holders to borrow against their tokens, and that protocols should create “smart infrastructure” such as undercollateralized loans, credit scores and artificial intelligence risk matching.The report adds that since January last year, borrower activity has declined by 90% and those willing to lend have shrunk by 78%.The average NFT loan size has also taken a hit from a peak of $22,000 in 2022 to $4,000 in May, a 71% year-over-year drop.Gherghelas said this shift “shows that either users are borrowing against lower-value assets or simply becoming more conservative with leverage.”NFT lending overall trading volume and market activity have dropped off from the all-time highs of past years. Source: DappRadarThe average loan duration is also lower; after hitting an average of roughly 40 days in 2023, it’s been down to 31 days and has held steady throughout 2024 and into 2025.Gherghelas said this could indicate that “loans are being taken more frequently but for shorter periods, perhaps a sign of more tactical liquidity plays.”NFT ﻿market downturn also hurts lendingPart of the slowdown in NFT lending is connected to the overall NFT market decline, which has seen volumes drop 61% in the first quarter to $1.5 billion compared to $4.1 billion a year ago.“With collateral value collapsing, the lending activity naturally followed,” Gherghelas said. “There are a few exceptions that managed to hold or regain traction, but they’ve been outliers, not enough to lift the sector.”Related: AI decentralized apps are coming for the Web3 throne: DappRadarThe protocol landscape has also narrowed, and the number of active NFT lending apps is limited, with only eight protocols holding any meaningful share.“The flip-for-liquidity model that worked during bull markets isn’t built for a quieter, more risk-averse environment. But that doesn’t mean NFT lending is finished; it’s simply shifting focus,” Gherghelas said.“Platforms are diversifying, use cases are shifting, and collateral preferences are changing. If the next wave builds on utility, culture, and better design, NFT lending might just find its second wind — one built to last.”Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-world-assets-revitalize-dying-nft-lending-dappradar?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

SharpLink will invest $425 million to acquire 120,000 ETH. Ethereum futures open interest hits an all-time high of $36.1 billion, with ETH price climbing 4.5% on the daily chart. Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming (SBET) announced a $425 million private investment in public equity (PIPE), acquiring approximately 69.1 million shares at $6.15 each to establish the first Nasdaq-listed Ethereum (ETH) treasury company.Spearheaded by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, this move mirrors Strategy’s (MSTR) successful Bitcoin treasury strategy, which has yielded over $8.2 billion in gains in 2025, by leveraging stock and bond sales to acquire BTC.Former Ethereum core developer and contributor Eric Conner highlighted the bullish implications of SharpLink’s move, noting its potential to create a “public ETH proxy for funds that can’t hold tokens directly.” Conner emphasized that the acquisition of 120,000 ETH—likely to be staked—could lead to “supply compression” by removing tokens from circulation. The Ether proponent also pointed to the “new narrative fuel” this provides, positioning ETH as a “digital reserve collateral” and potentially driving its adoption on mainstream balance sheets through an equity wrapper like $SBET.However, crypto analyst VICTOR cautioned against over-enthusiasm, outlining the risk of leveraging gains from an altcoin still down 19% in 2025. In Q1 2025, Cointelegraph reported a sharp decline in Ethereum network fees, dropping to $605,000 from $2.5 million in just two weeks in March, alongside a noticeable decrease in decentralized app (DApp) activity.

The majority of these rallies—eight out of ten—resulted in negative returns, while one rally triggered a short squeeze, driving prices higher, and another displayed neutral price action.From a technical perspective, Ether’s price action on the daily chart posted a descending triangle, a bullish breakout pattern, which creates equal highs and higher lows, converging toward an imminent rally. The pattern is bordered by two trendlines, the upper resistance, currently around $2,700 and the ascending support line. A bullish breakout above $2,677 targets the pattern’s measured move, calculated by adding the triangle’s height to the breakout point.

2025-05-27T20:30:26.000Z,"Maple Finance, FalconX secure Bitcoin-backed loans from Cantor Fitzgerald — Report","Wall Street financial firm Cantor Fitzgerald has closed its first Bitcoin lending deal nearly a year after announcing its crypto lending services.According to a May 27 Bloomberg report, Cantor provided Bitcoin-backed loans to FalconX and Maple Finance. FalconX, a digital asset broker, said it secured a facility worth over $100 million as part of a “broader credit framework,” while Maple Finance reportedly closed the first tranche of an agreement with Cantor.The service allows companies holding Bitcoin to borrow funds and use the cryptocurrency as collateral, providing a way to unlock liquidity without selling their BTC holdings. Cantor announced its Bitcoin financing business with an initial capital of $2 billion in July 2024, targeting institutional investors seeking to leverage their Bitcoin. At the time, the company said Anchorage Digital and Copper would serve as custodians and collateral managers in the venture.Credit markets are a fundamental part of the financial system, allowing capital to flow between borrowers and lenders and supporting economic activity across sectors. Their central role also means they can contribute to financial distress when risks are mismanaged. While mirroring some functions of traditional finance, crypto credit markets have been operating with less regulatory oversight.Digital asset crisis of 2022 This dynamic was evident during the 2022 crisis in the digital asset sector. Celsius Network, once a leading crypto lending platform, collapsed after engaging in risky financial practices and facing allegations of fraud. Similarly, BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2022 following significant exposure to the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.  According to a report from Galaxy, the total crypto lending market, including crypto-backed collateralized debt positions (CDPs) tied to stablecoins, stood at $36.5 billion in the last quarter of 2024, marking a 43% decline from its all-time high of $64.4 billion in 2021. Despite the broader contraction, onchain lending platforms have seen a dramatic rebound, with open borrowed positions surging to $19.1 billion by Q4 2024, a 959% increase over two years.

Bitcoin’s bullish momentum aligns with the favorable US financial conditions, as noted by Ecoinometrics. The macroeconomic-focused Bitcoin newsletter highlighted that the National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) shows a rapid shift to ultra-loose territory after a tightening phase in February 2025. The NFCI, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, tracks stress in the financial system by aggregating measures like credit spreads, leverage, and funding conditions. When the index moves into looser territory, it reflects easier access to capital and reduced market stress—conditions that typically encourage risk-taking behavior among investors.

2025-05-27T15:40:00.000Z,"93% of all Bitcoin is already mined. Here’s what that means","How much Bitcoin is left to mine?              Bitcoin’s total supply is hardcoded at 21 million BTC, a fixed upper limit that cannot be altered without a consensus-breaking change to the protocol. This finite cap is enforced at the protocol level and is central to Bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset.As of May 2025, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoin (BTC) have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created, and those remaining coins will be mined very slowly.The reason for this uneven distribution is Bitcoin’s exponential issuance schedule, governed by an event called the halving. When Bitcoin launched in 2009, the block reward was 50 BTC. Every 210,000 blocks — or approximately every four years — that reward is cut in half. Because the early rewards were so large, over 87% of the total supply was mined by the end of 2020. Each subsequent halving sharply reduces the rate of new issuance, meaning it will take over a century to mine the remaining 6.7%.According to current estimates, 99% of all Bitcoin will have been mined by 2035, but the final fraction — the last satoshis — won’t be produced until around the year 2140 due to the nature of geometric reward reduction.This engineered scarcity, combined with an immutable supply cap, is what draws comparisons between Bitcoin and physical commodities like gold. But Bitcoin is even more predictable: Gold’s supply grows at around 1.7% annually, whereas Bitcoin’s issuance rate is transparently declining.Did you know? Bitcoin’s supply curve is not terminal in the traditional sense. It follows an asymptotic trajectory — a kind of economic Zeno’s paradox — where rewards diminish indefinitely but never truly reach zero. Mining will continue until around 2140, by which point over 99.999% of the total 21 million BTC will have been issued.                  Beyond the supply cap: How lost coins make Bitcoin scarcer than you think              While over 93% of Bitcoin’s total supply has been mined, that doesn’t mean it’s all available. A significant portion is permanently out of circulation, lost due to forgotten passwords, misplaced wallets, destroyed hard drives or early adopters who never touched their coins again.Estimates from firms like Chainalysis and Glassnode suggest that between 3.0 million and 3.8 million BTC — roughly 14%-18% of the total supply — is likely gone for good. That includes high-profile dormant addresses like the one believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, which alone holds over 1.1 million BTC.This means Bitcoin’s true circulating supply may be closer to 16 million-17 million, not 21 million. And because Bitcoin is non-recoverable by design, any lost coins stay lost — permanently reducing supply over time.Now compare that to gold. Around 85% of the world’s total gold supply has been mined — approximately 216,265 metric tons, according to the World Gold Council — but nearly all of it remains in circulation or held in vaults, jewelry, ETFs and central banks. Gold can be remelted and reused; Bitcoin cannot be resurrected once access is lost.This distinction gives Bitcoin a kind of hardening scarcity, a supply that not only stops growing over time but quietly shrinks.As Bitcoin matures, it’s entering a monetary phase similar to gold: low issuance, high holder concentration and increasing demand-side sensitivity. But Bitcoin takes it further; its supply cap is hard, its loss rate is permanent, and its distribution is publicly auditable.This may lead to several outcomes:Increased price volatility as available supply becomes more limited and sensitive to market demandHigher long-term value concentration in the hands of those who remain active and secure in their key managementA premium on liquidity, where actually spendable BTC trades at a higher effective value than dormant supply.In extreme cases, this could produce a bifurcation between “circulating BTC” and “unreachable BTC,” with the former gaining greater economic significance, particularly in times of constrained exchange liquidity or macroeconomic stress.                  What happens when Bitcoin is fully mined?              There’s a popular assumption that as Bitcoin’s block rewards shrink, the network’s security will eventually suffer. But in practice, the mining economy is far more adaptive — and much more resilient — than that.Bitcoin’s mining incentives are governed by a self-correcting feedback loop: If mining becomes unprofitable, miners drop off the network, which in turn triggers a difficulty adjustment. Every 2,016 blocks (roughly every two weeks), the network recalibrates mining difficulty using a parameter known as nBits. The goal is to keep block times steady at around 10 minutes, regardless of how many miners are competing.So, if Bitcoin’s price drops, or the reward becomes too small relative to operating costs, inefficient miners simply exit. This causes difficulty to fall, lowering the cost for those who remain. The result is a system that continually rebalances itself, aligning network participation with available incentives.This mechanism has already been tested at scale. After China banned mining in mid-2021, Bitcoin’s global hashrate dropped by more than 50% in a matter of weeks. Yet the network continued to function without interruption, and within a few months, the hashrate fully recovered, as miners resumed operations in jurisdictions with lower energy costs and more favorable regulations.Critically, the idea that lower rewards will inherently threaten network security overlooks how mining is tied to profit margins, not nominal BTC amounts. As long as the market price supports the cost of hash power — even at 0.78125 BTC per block (post-2028 halving) or lower — miners will continue to secure the network.In other words, it’s not the absolute reward that matters, but whether mining remains profitable relative to costs. And thanks to Bitcoin’s built-in difficulty adjustment, it usually does.Even a century from now, when the block reward approaches zero, the network will likely still be protected by whatever combination of fees, base incentives and infrastructure efficiency exists at that time. But that’s a distant concern. In the meantime, the current system — hashrate adjusts, difficulty rebalances, miners adapt — remains one of the most robust elements of Bitcoin’s design.Did you know? On April 20, 2024, following the launch of the Runes protocol, Bitcoin miners earned over $80 million in transaction fees within a single day, surpassing the $26 million earned from block rewards. This marked the first time in Bitcoin’s history that transaction fees alone exceeded the block subsidy in daily miner revenue.                  The future of Bitcoin mining: Energy consumption              It’s a common misconception that rising Bitcoin prices will drive endless energy use. In reality, mining is constrained by profitability, not price alone.As block rewards shrink, miners are pushed toward thinner margins, and that means chasing the cheapest, cleanest energy available. Since China’s 2021 mining ban, hashrate has migrated to regions like North America and Northern Europe, where operators tap into surplus hydro, wind and underutilized grid energy.According to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, between 52% and 59% of Bitcoin mining now runs on renewables or low-emission sources. Regulations are reinforcing this trend, with several jurisdictions offering incentives for clean-powered mining or penalizing fossil-fuel operations.Moreover, the idea that higher BTC prices will always mean higher energy use misses how Bitcoin self-regulates: More miners raise difficulty, which compresses margins, capping energy expansion. Renewable-based mining brings its own challenges, but the dystopian future of endlessly expanding fossil-fueled hash power is increasingly unlikely.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/93-of-all-bitcoin-is-already-mined-heres-what-that-means?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) make this hypothetical a reality and solve one of the key challenges online: verifying age without sacrificing privacy. The need for better age verification todayWe're witnessing an uptick in laws being proposed restricting minors' access to social media and the internet, including in Australia, Florida, and China. To protect minors from inappropriate adult content, platform owners and governments often walk a tightrope between inaction and overreach. For example, the state of Louisiana in the US recently enacted a law meant to block minors from viewing porn. Sites required users to upload an ID before viewing content. The Free Speech Coalition challenged the law as unconstitutional, making the case that it infringed on First Amendment rights. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed on procedural grounds. The reaction, however, highlights the dilemma facing policymakers and platforms: how to block minors without violating adults' rights or creating new privacy risks.Traditional age verification failsCurrent age verification tools are either ineffective or invasive. Self-declaration is meaningless, since users can simply lie about their age. ID-based verification is overly invasive. No one should be required to upload their most sensitive documents, putting themselves at risk of data breaches and identity theft. Biometric solutions like fingerprints and face scans are convenient for users but raise important ethical, privacy, and security concerns. Biometric systems are not always accurate and may generate false positives and negatives. The irreversible nature of the data, which can't be changed like a regular password can, is also less than ideal. Other methods, like behavioral tracking and AI-driven verification of browser patterns, are also problematic, using machine learning to analyze user interactions and identify patterns and anomalies, raising concerns of a surveillance culture.ZKPs as the privacy-preserving solutionZero-knowledge proofs present a compelling solution. Like a government ID provider, a trusted entity verifies the user's age and generates a cryptographic proof confirming they are over the required age. Websites only need to check the proof, not the excess personal data, ensuring privacy while keeping minors at the gates. No centralized data storage is required, alleviating the burden on platforms such as Google, Meta, and WhatsApp and eliminating the risk of data breaches. Recent: How zero-knowledge proofs can make AI fairerAdopting and enforcing ZKPs at scaleZKPs aren't a silver bullet. They can be complex to implement. The notion of \""don't trust, verify,\"" proven by indisputable mathematics, may cause some regulatory skepticism. Policymakers may hesitate to trust cryptographic proofs over visible ID verification. There are occasions when companies may need to disclose personal information to authorities, such as during an investigation into financial crimes or government inquiries. This would challenge ZKPs, whose very intention is for platforms not to hold this data in the first place.ZKPs also struggle with scalability and performance, being somewhat computationally intensive and tricky to program. Efficient implementation techniques are being explored, and breakthroughs, such as the Noir programming language, are making ZKPs more accessible to developers, driving the adoption of secure, privacy-first solutions. A safer, smarter future for age verificationGoogle's move to adopt ZKPs for age verification is a promising signal that mainstream platforms are beginning to embrace privacy-preserving technologies. But to fully realize the potential of ZKPs, we need more than isolated solutions locked into proprietary ecosystems. Crypto-native wallets can go further. Open-source and permissionless blockchain-based systems offer interoperability, composability, and programmable identity. With a single proof, users can access a range of services across the open web — no need to start from scratch every time, or trust a single provider (Google) with their credentials.ZKPs flip the script on online identity — proving what matters, without exposing anything else. They protect user privacy, help platforms stay compliant, and block minors from restricted content, all without creating new honeypots of sensitive data.Google's adoption of ZKPs shows mainstream momentum is building. But to truly transform digital identity, we must embrace crypto-native, decentralized systems that give users control over what they share and who they are online.In an era defined by surveillance, ZKPs offer a better path forward — one that's secure, private, and built for the future.Opinion by: Andre Omietanski, General Counsel, and Amal Ibraymi, Legal Counsel at Aztec Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-27T14:30:00.000Z,"What is a cryptocurrency mixer and how does it work?","Cryptocurrency mixers explained              A cryptocurrency mixer is a specialized service designed to increase the privacy and anonymity of blockchain transactions. Unlike traditional financial transactions, which are private by default, most cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) operate on public blockchains. This means every transaction is permanently recorded and accessible to anyone, making it possible for blockchain analysts or malicious actors to trace the flow of funds between wallets.A crypto mixer’s primary function is to break the link between the sender’s wallet and the recipient’s wallet. It does so by pooling together coins from many users and then redistributing them in a way that makes it difficult to track which coins went where. Think of it like a digital version of shuffling cards in a deck. After mixing, your cryptocurrency is returned to you or a recipient’s address, but it’s “cleaned” of any direct transaction history.This privacy-enhancing feature is why some people rely on mixers, especially those seeking to keep their financial activities confidential in an open-ledger world.                  How does a crypto mixer work?              To understand a crypto mixer, it’s useful to compare it to the concept of money laundering in traditional finance, albeit with legal and ethical nuances. The process of “mixing” is essentially designed to obscure the origin and destination of coins.Here’s a typical workflow of how a cryptocurrency mixer operates:Deposit: You send your cryptocurrency to the mixer’s wallet address. Multiple users do the same, creating a large pool of coins.Mixing/shuffling: The mixer’s system pools and shuffles these coins together, breaking any visible connection between deposited and withdrawn funds.Redistribution: After mixing, the service sends back an equivalent amount of coins to your specified address, but these aren’t the same coins you deposited. They come from the pooled coins of all participants.Fees: The mixer usually deducts a small fee, generally ranging from 1% to 3%, to cover operational costs.This process effectively disrupts blockchain analysis, making it extremely difficult for anyone to trace the coins back to their original owners.                  Types of cryptocurrency mixers              Not all mixers are created equal. They can broadly be divided into two categories: centralized and decentralized mixers.Centralized mixersCentralized mixers are the most common and operate similarly to traditional services. You send your coins to a company or entity that controls the mixing process, and then they send back “clean” coins after mixing. These services are relatively easy to use, often providing a simple user interface.However, centralized mixers require you to trust the service operator with your coins, at least temporarily. This introduces risks such as:The mixer could be a scam and disappear with your funds.It could be hacked, exposing users’ data and coins.The operator may keep logs that could compromise your privacy.Decentralized mixersDecentralized mixers use blockchain technology and smart contracts to automate the mixing process without a trusted third party. They rely on cryptographic methods such as zero-knowledge proofs to mix coins in a trustless environment. Users pool their coins into a smart contract, which then redistributes coins in a way that ensures privacy.Advantages of decentralized mixers include:No central point of failure or custody risk.Higher privacy because no single party controls the funds.Often more resistant to regulatory crackdowns.Did you know? The DOJ indicted four Russians for operating crypto mixers Blender.io and Sinbad.io, yet failed to show they knowingly laundered illicit funds. The indictment relies heavily on vague forum posts and lacks concrete evidence of criminal intent or ties to US commerce, raising serious doubts about its strength in court.                  Real-world cases involving mixers and scams              Unfortunately, the privacy offered by crypto mixers has also attracted criminals. The very anonymity that protects innocent users can also shield illicit activities, leading to widespread misuse.Crypto mixers have been linked to ransomware attacks, dark web marketplaces, fraud and drug trafficking. Criminals often use these services to “clean” proceeds from illegal transactions and hide their tracks from law enforcement.A notable example is ChipMixer, a service seized by Europol in 2023 for allegedly facilitating money laundering for dark web markets and ransomware groups. Authorities dismantled the platform’s infrastructure over alleged money laundering, seizing four servers, 1,909.4 BTC (about $210 million as of May 26, 2025) and seven TB of data across 55 transactions.Mixers have also been involved in laundering stolen funds from cryptocurrency exchange hacks. The complexity of these transactions makes it difficult for investigators to recover stolen assets.In February 2025, Bybit, a major cryptocurrency exchange, suffered a significant security breach resulting in the theft of about $1.5 billion worth of cryptocurrencies. The attackers, attributed to the Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking organization, employed various crypto mixers, including Wasabi, CryptoMixer, Railgun and Tornado Cash, to launder portions of the stolen assets. Despite efforts to trace the funds, a significant portion remains unaccounted for, highlighting the challenges posed by mixers in cybersecurity investigations.                  Are crypto mixers legal?              The legal status of cryptocurrency mixers depends largely on the jurisdiction and context of their use.Most governments impose strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing regulations on financial services, including digital currency services. Mixers, by their nature, complicate AML compliance because they obscure transaction trails.For instance,In the European Union, the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD) includes digital currency providers under its regulatory scope, requiring them to perform KYC checks and report suspicious activity.In the United States, FinCEN classifies cryptocurrency mixers as money transmitters, requiring registration and compliance with AML regulations. Unlicensed mixers can face severe penalties and criminal charges.Legal uses vs misuseUsing a mixer for privacy reasons is not inherently illegal. However, if mixers are used to launder proceeds from crimes, authorities will prosecute offenders. Similarly, operating a mixer without appropriate licenses or regulatory oversight can be illegal.If you choose to use a mixer, make sure you understand the legal implications in your country and avoid any activity that could be linked to money laundering or fraud.Did you know? Crypto mixer transactions are still taxable. Using a mixer doesn’t hide gains from tax authorities; failing to report them can trigger audits or penalties. Always keep records and understand your local tax obligations.                  How to stay safe and avoid scam-linked mixers              If you decide to use a cryptocurrency mixer, your safety and security should be paramount. Here are some essential tips to avoid scams and legal troubles:Choose reputable mixers: Conduct thorough research. Look for mixers with good reviews, transparent operations and clear compliance policies.Avoid unknown or suspicious services: Steer clear of mixers linked to scams, hacks or regulatory actions.Check for licensing and compliance: Prefer mixers that comply with AML/KYC regulations, especially if you are a business or high-value user.Understand fees and timelines: Be clear on the fees involved and the expected time for your funds to be returned after mixing.Use hardware wallets and strong security practices: Always safeguard your private keys and use hardware wallets to minimize risks.Stay updated on regulations: Laws surrounding crypto mixers evolve rapidly. Staying informed will help you avoid inadvertent legal violations.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-mixer-and-how-does-it-work?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
