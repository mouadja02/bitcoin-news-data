2025-05-28T19:55:55.000Z,"US Banks See $70,600,000,000 in Profits in First Quarter As Non-Interest Income Jumps: FDIC","The US banking industry saw a rise in profits in the first quarter of the year driven by a jump in non-interest income, according to new government numbers. In an announcement from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the agency says that financial institutions in the US reported a return of 1.16% and net income of $70.6 billion. The FDIC says the rise in income was a jump of $3.8 billion, or 5.8%, from the previous quarter. Source: FDIC Says FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill, “With strong capital and liquidity levels to support lending and protect against potential losses, the banking industry continued to support the country’s needs for financial services while navigating the challenges presented by economic uncertainty, elevated inflation and interest rates, tighter credit, and elevated unrealized losses.” Earlier this month, market intelligence giant S&P Global reported that the top four US banks have seen their assets grow in the past three months by a whopping $681.71 billion. S&P Global says that the combined assets of JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citibank and Wells Fargo ballooned by 5.9%, or $681.71 billion, in the first quarter of the year. The massive asset growth is in stark contrast to “a 2.9% contraction in the previous quarter.” “JPMorgan Chase & Co., the biggest US bank at $4.358 trillion in total assets as of March 31, reported an increase of $355.04 billion in assets in the first quarter. That marked the third-highest sequential increase among the nation’s 50 largest banks at 8.9%. Citigroup Inc. posted the second-highest sequential growth at 9.3%, or an increase of $218.57 billion in assets. Bank of America Corp. reported asset growth of 2.7% from the prior quarter, while Wells Fargo & Co.’s assets increased 1.1% in the same period.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-05-28T19:36:07.000Z,"New Tension in US-China Trade War: Trump Issues Strong Order","US President Donald Trump has taken a new step in a bid to limit China’s capacity to manufacture advanced chips. The Trump administration has ordered American companies that develop software used to design semiconductors to stop selling those services to Chinese groups. According to sources familiar with the matter, the US Department of Commerce has told companies such as Cadence, Synopsys and Siemens EDA, which produce Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software, to end their sales to China. This decision was conveyed in official letters sent by the Bureau of Industry and Security responsible for Export Control within the department. However, it is not yet clear whether all EDA companies have received such letters. The move is seen as the Trump administration’s latest effort to curb China’s ability to produce AI chips. In April, the U.S. also restricted exports of Nvidia’s AI chips, which it developed specifically for China. Related News: Bitcoin (BTC) Price Sees Sharp Correction: Analysis Firm Shares Its Expectations for the Future Commerce Ministry officials said exports of strategic importance to China were being reviewed. “In some cases, we have suspended existing export licenses or imposed new license requirements,” one official said. Although EDA software accounts for a small portion of the total semiconductor industry, it plays a key role in designing and testing next-generation chips. About 80 percent of the Chinese EDA market is controlled by Synopsys, Cadence Design Systems, and Siemens EDA. In fact, the first restriction in this area was introduced during the Biden administration in 2022. At that time, the sale of the most advanced chip design software to China was banned, but companies continued to sell products that complied with export controls. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-28T19:30:05.000Z,"Old Bitcoin Wakes Up As 1y–5y Holder Activity Spikes – What Are LTH Signaling?","After reaching a new all-time high of $112,000, Bitcoin is now consolidating just below this level, holding strong above the key $106,000 support zone. Despite short-term resistance, the broader structure remains bullish, with analysts expecting an impulsive move once BTC reclaims higher ground. With global markets facing heightened economic uncertainty, Bitcoin continues to show resilience, thriving as a hedge and outperforming traditional risk assets. Market sentiment remains positive as on-chain signals strengthen the bullish outlook. According to new data from Glassnode, spending by older Bitcoin holders is heating up once again. Aggregate transaction volume from the 1-year to 5-year holding cohorts has surged to $4.02 billion, marking the highest level since February. This uptick in long-term holder activity often precedes major market shifts, as veteran participants begin to reposition. While some view this as potential profit-taking, it also signals renewed confidence and market engagement from experienced holders. As BTC consolidates near record highs, this behavior could reflect long-term investors preparing for broader market participation in the next leg up. Bitcoin Faces Pivotal Test as Long-Term Holders Move Billions Bitcoin is facing a critical moment as it consolidates just below its all-time high near $112,000. After rallying more than 50% since its April low, BTC now needs to hold above the $106K–$108K zone and decisively push past the $112K level to confirm a new bullish impulse. The coming days are likely to set the tone for the next leg of this cycle. Macroeconomic tensions are intensifying, with US and Japanese treasury yields flashing signs of systemic stress. In this climate, Bitcoin appears to be thriving as a hedge against traditional financial instability. Its non-sovereign, decentralized nature continues to attract capital in times of uncertainty, and the recent price action suggests that trend is gaining strength. On-chain data from Glassnode adds further depth to the picture. Spending by older Bitcoin holders—those in the 1–5 year cohort—has surged, with aggregate volume reaching $4.02 billion, the highest since February. The breakdown reveals notable outflows from long-term wallets: 3–5 year cohort: $2.16B (second-largest this cycle, behind March 2024’s $6B) 2–3 year cohort: $1.41B 1–2 year cohort: $450M This marks the fifth-largest 1–5 year spending spike of the current cycle, driven primarily by holders with three or more years of holding time. While some interpret this as profit-taking, it may also signal conviction among experienced participants rotating capital or positioning for further gains. With technical support holding and liquidity steadily returning, Bitcoin is on the verge of what could be a major breakout. A clean move above $112K with volume would validate the next phase of the bull market—and potentially open the door to $120K and beyond. BTC Consolidates Below ATH As Bulls Defend Key Levels Bitcoin is trading at $108,858 on the daily chart, consolidating just below its recent all-time high of $112,000. Price action shows that BTC is holding above the previous resistance zone turned support near $103,600, a level that provided the base for May’s breakout. The market structure remains bullish, with Bitcoin printing a series of higher highs and higher lows since its April bottom. The 34 EMA (green) at $102,277 and the 50 SMA (blue) at $96,844 are both trending upward, reinforcing a strong medium-term uptrend. These moving averages now act as dynamic support in the event of any pullbacks. Volume has slightly decreased during this consolidation, which is typical after a strong impulse move, suggesting that the market is pausing before its next major decision. To resume the bullish trend, BTC needs to close convincingly above the $112K mark. A breakout with strong volume could open the door to a rapid move toward $120K and beyond. On the downside, maintaining support above $103,600 is crucial to avoid a deeper retracement.

2025-05-28T19:29:14.000Z,"Bitcoin (BTC) Price Sees Sharp Correction: Analysis Firm Shares Its Expectations for the Future","NYDIG, one of the leading financial services companies in the cryptocurrency markets, evaluated Bitcoin's recent rally and market indicators in its report this week. The firm noted that Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $112,000 last week, coinciding with turbulence in traditional markets. The rally also surpassed the previous peak of $109,358 set in January. The report recalled that Bitcoin experienced a sharp correction of 28.2% before reaching this level, falling to $ 74,400 after Trump's “Freedom Day” when he began to impose tariffs. However, according to NYDIG, these corrections are a natural part of the uptrend that started at $ 15,460 in November 2022. Interestingly, NYDIG data suggests that this cycle has been less volatile than previous Bitcoin bull markets. The current cycle has seen losses of 10% or more only seven times, compared to 13 and 10 in the previous two cycles, respectively. What’s more, these declines have been both more frequent and deeper.

Pointing out that Bitcoin has increased 7.1 times compared to closing prices (7.2 times compared to the current high price) since the $ 15,450 bottom seen in November 2022, NYDIG states that a repeat of the 20-fold increases in past cycles is not expected, but there is still significant upside potential. The report noted that perpetual swap and forward rates, which are indicators of speculative activity, are currently well below historical levels, suggesting that the current rally is not fueled by excessive speculation. Additionally, the MVRV ratio currently stands at 2.4x, which is low compared to past cycles. NYDIG notes that this indicator has peaked at 4.0x in previous cycles, but with each new cycle these peaks have trended downward. NYDIG analyzes the coefficients of the rise from bottom to top, indicating that there is still significant upside potential for Bitcoin across possible price scenarios. *This is not investment advice.

The raise was led by Saudi Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Abdulaziz Al Saud, investing $100 million, a spokesperson to the company told CoinDesk. The company sold 20 million ordinary shares priced at $6.05 per share. Adam Traidman, a former Ripple executive who led the SBI Ripple Asia, is joining the company as chairman of the board of advisors, according to the press release. Ripple is an enterprise-focused blockchain service provider closely related to the XRP Ledger. VivoPower shares surged as much as 26% on the news before giving back some of the gains. Recently, they were up over 11%, trading around $6.75. The move is the latest example of public firms raising money to purchase and add digital assets to their treasuries, a playbook popularized by Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR) that has become the largest corporate holder of bitcoin BTC. While BTC has been the most sought-after asset among these firms, recent newcomers like DeFi Development and SharpLink Gaming directed their focus to Solana's SOL SOL and Ethereum's ether ETH, respectively. VivoPower, founded in 2014, aims to be the first publicly traded company with a crypto treasury strategy centered around XRP. It also plans to spin off its legacy business. \""After reviewing a number of listed vehicles seeking to embrace a digital asset treasury model, we selected VivoPower given its strategic focus on XRP and its objective to contribute to building out of the XRPL ecosystem,\"" Prince Abdulaziz said in a statement. \""We have been investors in the digital asset sector for a decade and have been long-term holders of XRP.\"" Read more: Dubai Unveils Real Estate Tokenization Platform on XRP Ledger Amid $16B Initiative",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/28/vivopower-raises-121m-to-launch-xrp-treasury-strategy-with-saudi-royal-backing,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL|XRP","Markets|XRP|Ripple|Saudi Arabia|News",cryptocompare

2025-05-28T19:12:25.000Z,"Cynthia Lummis Says US Military Leaders Support Bitcoin Reserve","U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis has stated that American military generals are “big supporters” of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. The Wyoming lawmaker made the remarks earlier this week while addressing attendees at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Economic Power and Security According to Lummis, she has spoken to generals who understand that economic power is just as important as military power when dealing with aggressors around the world. She explained that this is why they strongly support the proposal. During her speech, the Republican politician also revealed that President Donald Trump is supportive of her Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act. The announcement follows the March 11 reintroduction of legislation by her and five other senators to add up to 1 million BTC to the U.S. Treasury over five years. Referring to the flagship cryptocurrency as “digital gold,” Lummis called for the U.S. to match its gold holding strategy for the proposal. “We have about 5% of the world’s gold in the United States in reserve. We need to have at least 5% of the world’s Bitcoin in reserve,” she said. The senator also connected the proposal to U.S. energy and industrial strategy. She credited China’s 2021 Bitcoin mining ban for shifting operations to North America and highlighted President Trump’s recent remarks urging the country to combine both. However, she believes that a national Bitcoin stockpile is the ultimate way of securing geopolitical advantage. State-Level and Global Initiatives The 70-year-old pointed to growing support for BTC reserves at the state level, claiming they have always been the “incubators of innovation,” with the United States leading through them. She emphasized that 30 American states are considering the initiative this year. Specifically, Lummis highlighted that Arizona, Texas, and New Hampshire have already advanced legislation in 2025 aimed at holding the cryptocurrency as a strategic asset. New Hampshire recently passed House Bill 302, allowing it to allocate 5% of funds in BTC for diversification. Arizona’s House Bill 2749 has also established a stockpile funded through unclaimed assets and staking rewards instead of direct state investment. Meanwhile, Texas is advancing Senate Bill 21, which proposes a state-managed BTC reserve stored in cold storage for security. Lummis also noted how the movement is happening globally. For example, the United Arab Emirates is getting exposure to Bitcoin through American spot BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Another initiative mentioned involves the Czech Republic, which is exploring how to include the digital asset in its diversified asset allocation through its central bank.

During his speech, Adams encouraged crypto businesses to return to the U.S. and set up shop in New York, echoing comments he made last week at the city's first-ever crypto summit held at Gracie Mansion, the mayor's official home in Manhattan. \""New York is the Empire State. We don't break empires. We build empires. We're saying to you, come back home,\"" Adams said. \""[I'm] the Bitcoin mayor, and I want you back in the City of New York, where you won't be attacked and criminalized. Let's get rid of the [Bit]License and allow us to have the free flow of bitcoin in our city.\"" Adams has previously criticized the BitLicense, the notoriously difficult-to-obtain license issued by New York's top financial regulator, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). However, when asked about the impact of the BitLicense and NYDFS's reputation as a tough regulator during a press conference earlier this month, Adams hedged, saying it was \""good to know the city is going to have safe regulations in place for those who are investing and there's not going to be any abuses, but at the same time, we can over regulate.\"" Adams also promised to fight for the creation of a so-called BitBond, probably referring to a municipal bond backed by bitcoin. Such a bond could potentially allow residents of New York to gain exposure to the top cryptocurrency in a tax-advantaged way. The instrument would also enable the city to raise capital. Adams did not provide details about the city's potential BitBond. However, the Bitcoin Policy Institute released a policy brief in March advocating for BitBonds that would use 90% of their proceeds to fund government and 10% to purchase bitcoin. Holders of the bond would receive 1% interest annually for 10 years. Upon maturity of the bond, they would also receive 100% of bitcoin's upside up to 4.5% compounded return, then 50% of all remaining upside. Any remaining bitcoin gains would be used to constitute the government's bitcoin reserve.

The collaboration leverages Chintai’s institutional-grade asset origination and compliance infrastructure to set a new benchmark for Bitcoin-native finance. Through a white-label integration of Chintai’s technology, Arch Network will launch HoneyB: the first Bitcoin-native platform for tokenizing real-world assets Supercharging Institutional Assets With Bitcoin-Native Liquidity and Yield Bitcoin’s lack of programmability has left the leading cryptocurrency largely under-utilized, with less than 1% participation in the exploding decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Arch’s technology enables DeFi apps on the Bitcoin base layer without forcing users to bridge or wrap their assets on another chain. This empowers institutions and retail investors alike to tap Bitcoin’s deep liquidity and generate Bitcoin-native yield without compromising custody, trust, or chain integrity. The tokenization of traditional assets already gives institutions vastly improved distribution and liquidity for traditionally illiquid assets. By combining Arch Network’s ability to mobilize Bitcoin with Chintai’s fully compliant tokenization platform, the HoneyB offering creates a major paradigm shift in the RWA space. \""This partnership represents a significant advancement in Bitcoin-based finance,\"" said Josh Gordon, MD of Chintai. \""By bringing real-world assets to Bitcoin in a compliant manner, we're expanding the utility of the network while maintaining the integrity and security that makes Bitcoin trusted worldwide.\"" Crypto Maturity—Where Compliance Meets Opportunity As global regulation begins to catch up with technology, the confidence and participation of institutional finance in the digital assets space are accelerating.

Another Major Obstacle for Cryptocurrencies Has Been Removed!","More positive news for cryptocurrencies came from the US, with the US Department of Labor withdrawing its cautionary cryptocurrency guidance for 401(k) plans. The U.S. Department of Labor has withdrawn its previous guidance and restrictions for 2022 that prevented retirement administrators from considering Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies as 401(k) investment options, The Block reports. The Labor Department has become the latest agency to walk back previous statements restricting cryptocurrency activity since US President Donald Trump took office in January. US Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer announced the withdrawal of guidance that urged executives to “exercise extreme caution” before adding crypto to their investment strategies in 2022. Stating that the ministry is responsible for protecting employees and retirees, Lori Chavez-DeRemer argued that cryptocurrency investment decisions should be left to the relevant institutions, not bureaucrats. He criticized the department’s previous stance as excessive government intervention. DeRemer blamed the Biden administration, adding that the department now takes a neutral position on cryptocurrencies in retirement plans. “The Biden administration's Department of Labor has chosen to put its finger on the scale by taking a biased stance on cryptocurrencies. But we push back on this excess and make clear that investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not DC bureaucrats.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-28T18:42:26.000Z,"We asked an expert about quantum computer threat as Google and BlackRock ring the alarm","On May 27, it was reported that the investment management giant BlackRock warned investors that the Bitcoin network is vulnerable to quantum computers. Researchers from Google made a similar statement the same day. The CEO of decentralized post-quantum infrastructure, Naoris Protocol, David Carvalho, answered our questions to clarify the risks and whether there is hope. Speculations about the risk of the Bitcoin network being cracked by quantum computers in the near future are not something new. It is impossible to brute force RSA and ECC encryption used in Bitcoin with modern-day processors, but it is believed that quantum computers will be able to retrieve private keys if the public key is available. The date when quantum computers will achieve sufficient power to break Bitcoin wallets is referred to as Q Day. Let's add some nuance here. While quantum threats to cryptography are real, the timeline matters. Current quantum computers are nowhere near breaking Bitcoin's cryptography. The industry is already working on quantum-resistant solutions. — T (@agentic_t) May 27, 2025 Unlike regular processors, quantum processors can perform multiple calculations simultaneously, which dramatically increases computing speed. Several companies seek solutions to avoid the potential risks. Some wallet producers already claim their products are quantum-proof. Read more: Project 11 challenges everyone to crack the Bitcoin key using a quantum computer. The reward is 1 BTC BlackRock’s statement In the updated version of BlackRock’s prospectus for IBIT (BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF), the company warns investors about potential security risks associated with Bitcoin. BlackRock highlights the issue that developers of decentralized networks often lack a financial incentive to respond in a timely manner to security threats. One of the outlined threats is quantum computers, which, in a few years, will become powerful enough to crack the encryption used in Bitcoin. Below, you can see an extract pointing at the possibility of the security breach and the implication of such a breach on the price of IBIT (and understandingly, Bitcoin itself): “…a malicious actor may be able to compromise the security of the Bitcoin network or take the Trust’s bitcoin, which would adversely affect the value of the Shares. Moreover, the functionality of the Bitcoin network may be negatively affected such that it is no longer attractive to users, thereby dampening demand for bitcoin. Even if another digital asset other than bitcoin were affected by similar circumstances, any reduction in confidence in the source code or cryptography underlying digital assets generally could negatively affect the demand for digital assets and therefore adversely affect the value of the Shares.” The warning by BlackRock garnered attention, as the issue of quantum computers had never been publicly acknowledged at such a high level before. If such a large and respected company sees the problem in quantum computers, it is a signal that the threat is considerable. The Google study and a bit of irony A new study by Google suggests that the amount of resources needed to reach the Q Day is 20 times less than previously estimated. The author of the paper, Craig Gidney, writes: “In this paper, I reduced the expected number of qubits needed to break RSA2048 from 20 million to 1 million. My hope is that this provides a sign post for the current state of the art in quantum factoring, and informs how quickly quantum-safe cryptosystems should be deployed Vulnerable systems should be deprecated after 2030 and disallowed after 2035. Not because I expect sufficiently large quantum computers to exist by 2030, but because I prefer security to not be contingent on progress being slow.” Ironically, it is Google who works on advancing quantum computing. Its Sycamore processor has 53 physical qubits, which places it among the ten most powerful quantum computers currently existing. We discussed this topic with an expert To better understand what will happen when Q Day arrives and how much time is left, we addressed several questions to David Carvalho, founder and CEO of the decentralized post-quantum infrastructure, Naoris Protocol. Crypto.news: How much time do we have before the first Bitcoin wallet gets ‘hacked’ via a quantum computer? David Carvalho: A lot less time than people seem to think. There’s a whole lot of noise this week because a Google analyst has published a report saying it will take far less time than anticipated, but the cybersecurity community has known this for a while. Very soon – within five years or even less – we’ll get to a point where quantum computers have enough qubits and sufficient error correction to be a real threat to ECDSA encryption. We don’t know exactly when this will happen yet, but we do know that any protocol that doesn’t implement quantum security now won’t be able to retrofit it once quantum computers do catch up. So now is the time to focus all efforts on this before it’s too late. CN: What happens next after the quantum computer achieves the ability to hack BTC wallets? DC: The most frightening thing about quantum is that when we get to “Q-Day”, the attacks will be swift, quite possibly simultaneous, and certainly devastating. And most importantly, retroactive, meaning that even transactions that have been signed and executed could be at risk. Which means that wallets and blockchains can’t secure themselves against quantum attacks retroactively, they have to do it preemptively. CN: Will quantum computers be immediately available for bad actors? Are all the non-quantum-proof BTC wallets being hacked simultaneously? DC: Well, it’s unlikely there will be such a coordinated effort. Bad actors will likely target the biggest and most vulnerable wallets first and then move on to smaller targets. But that, in itself, is incredibly worrying, since the biggest targets are the likes of BlackRock, the second-largest holder of Bitcoin, which is also responsible for trillions of dollars in pension assets. It’s a real risk to financial stability. CN: What will be the fate of “lost bitcoins” and Satoshi Nakamoto’s holdings? DC: All of those “dormant” assets would be ripe for the picking, unless the blockchain is secured at the infrastructure level, because Satoshi will have almost certainly made transactions from vulnerable addresses. Given Satoshi’s substantial holdings, they would likely be a major target for bad actors. CN: In the event that non-quantum-proof BTC wallets are successfully hacked, will it be a good advertisement for quantum-proof wallets, or will it scare off the masses from Bitcoin and send the price down? DC: A quantum hack on Bitcoin would lead to a real loss of trust, so it wouldn’t be good news for the price. Like any black swan event, it could be the catalyst for a crypto winter. However, the fact that major institutions, and even governments, are now holding Bitcoin is encouraging. Because they are actually acutely aware of the risks from quantum computing – in fact, BlackRock recently highlighted it in its updated spot Bitcoin ETF filing. If anyone can push the blockchain sector to prepare for Q Day, it’s BlackRock and the US government. But they better do it quickly. Conclusion All in all, the fall of Bitcoin’s protection is only a matter of time, and time is running out, considering how many elements of the puzzle need to be switched to quantum-proof solutions – from mining infrastructure to exchanges and wallets. Transitioning to quantum-proof services may take time, so it’s better to start early.

In a new press release, the DOL says it’s rolling back its 2022 compliance release, which previously instructed institutions to forgo using crypto assets as options for 401(k) plans. In 2022, the DOL warned fiduciaries to use “extreme care” before offering digital assets as options for retirement plans, language that was considered unusual at the time as the agency historically has taken a neutral approach toward the subject, according to the press release. According to U.S. Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer, the DOL is rolling back the government overreach created by the Biden Administration. Says Chavez-DeRemer, “The Biden administration’s department of labor made a choice to put their thumb on the scale. We’re rolling back this overreach and making it clear that investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not D.C. bureaucrats.” The DOL says it’s neither endorsing nor disapproving of employers who choose to include crypto assets and notes that its reasoning extends to other crypto-related products, such as derivatives. Previously, the DOL said it had “serious concerns” about people’s retirement funds being tied up in crypto due to “significant risks of fraud, theft, and loss.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Top Trader Shares Honest Opinion","Amid ongoing speculation in the crypto community, the idea that XRP could eventually reach $99 has resurfaced among some of its more optimistic supporters. However, professional traders remain skeptical. Tony “The Bull” Severino, a respected figure in the trading space, dismissed the target outright, stating there is no plausible possibility XRP could achieve that valuation under current conditions. Is XRP almost ready for its final thrust up? Monthly RSI is holding at a similar level as late 2017 pic.twitter.com/CR7T6KHrFK — Tony \""The Bull\"" Severino, CMT (@TonyTheBullCMT) May 26, 2025 As of this writing, XRP is trading at approximately $2.25. Reaching $99 would require an increase of more than 4,300%, pushing the asset’s market capitalization into territory currently held by Bitcoin. Severino emphasized that such a leap is highly improbable without an unprecedented global financial shift favouring XRP, which he regards as completely unrealistic. Technical Indicators Show Strength, But No Justification for $99 Technical indicators on XRP’s monthly chart reflect strong momentum, particularly with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at levels last recorded in 2017. However, this does not imply that exponential price growth is imminent. On the daily chart, a descending triangle pattern is visible, suggesting a period of consolidation. The price remains constrained by declining resistance, while the 100-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) act as support zones for buyers. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Analysts note that a breakout from this pattern could drive XRP back toward the $3 level . However, gains beyond that point are unlikely in the absence of a major fundamental catalyst. XRP’s current network data supports this cautious viewpoint. On-chain metrics and payment volumes indicate gradual, steady usage rather than explosive growth. Burn Rate Uptick Doesn’t Support Moonshot Projections XRP’s built-in burn mechanism, which permanently removes small amounts of tokens with every transaction, has seen a minor uptick in recent weeks. While this increase suggests higher network activity, it does not point to a level of demand capable of supporting a 50-fold price increase. In light of these observations, market experts advise caution. While short-term rallies are possible, projections above $3 to $4 should be approached conservatively unless the broader environment changes significantly. Severino’s response reflects this perspective, reinforcing the view that $99 is not a realistic target for the foreseeable future. Investors are encouraged to monitor potential breakouts, but should manage expectations and avoid being influenced by overly speculative forecasts.

This has brought Senator Tommy Tuberville’s bill to a success as he pushed to allow crypto investments in retirement funds. The department takes neutrality in crypto investments The 2022 guidance released by the agency tasked with protecting workers and retirees encouraged managers to “exercise extreme care” before adding crypto to their investment strategies. 401(k) plans generally restricted crypto investing, only offering indirect exposure via ETFs, mutual funds, or employer-approved options. Before the 2022 release, the Department had generally said it had no opinion on certain types of investments and strategies. Today’s release goes back to how the Department did things by not supporting or opposing plan managers who decided that adding crypto to a plan’s investment options is a good idea. Still, a plan manager’s choice about which type of investment to make should consider all the important facts and circumstances and will “necessarily be context-specific.” More importantly, the government’s stance is now fully neutral, meaning plan providers can offer crypto exposure. The Labor Department is the most recent government body to change its mind about limiting crypto activity since President Trump took office in January amidst others. In March, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation reversed standards that require financial institutions to tell the agency before engaging in crypto-related activities. Later, the Federal Reserve took back its advice that banks shouldn’t get involved in crypto. The crypto market is stuck between a bull and a bear rally In the past 24 hours, the market capitalization has gone down 4.1% to $3.51 trillion, but that’s still higher than the recent highs of $3.49 trillion on Tuesday and almost at $3.54 trillion last Friday. Given how risk-averse the stock markets have been over the last few days, this is an interesting move. Bitcoin prices have been going up and down by 5% every day since May 22. They are now in the middle of that range at $111.7k. This area of highs is part of a circular extension pattern. It is 161.8% of the first upward motion from the beginning of April to the first days of May. Getting past 112k would then lead to 134k (261.8%). The SEC’s next meeting The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will hold a major “Emerging Trends in Asset Management” conference on June 5. The conference will focus on digital assets and tokenization. This move comes at a time when blockchain and token-based trading models are becoming more popular in the business world. At the event, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, known as “Crypto Mom,” will be joined by leaders from BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and Fidelity, among others. Because the SEC chose to include a session on digital assets shows that things are changing. It seems like regulators are not only keeping a close eye on the crypto market, but they are also now getting involved with it. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-05-28T18:24:02.000Z,"Bitcoin: This Investor Would Never Buy, But He Gave Golden Tips That Reinforce The Thesis","Summary I recommend buying Bitcoin due to accelerating adoption by states, institutions, and retail, with Arizona allocating up to 10% of reserves to BTC. Institutional inflows into Bitcoin ETFs are soaring, and Bitcoin now ranks as the 8th largest currency by market cap. Price models tied to global money supply and mining costs suggest Bitcoin could reach $125,000 by mid-year and $200,000 by 2026. Despite short-term risks from global austerity and increased short positions, Bitcoin's risk-return profile remains highly attractive versus other assets. Investment Thesis I recommend buying Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). The adoption of Bitcoin has accelerated across multiple fronts, such as the decision of the state of Arizona to allocate up to 10% of its reserves in Bitcoin. Among companies, Revolut (which has 50 million customers) announced the integration with the Bitcoin Lightning Network, which will increase its use as a means of payment. Meanwhile, retail adoption is accelerating as there are more Bitcoin investors than gold in America. Bitcoin's market cap has already surpassed the Taiwan dollar, positioning it as the 8th largest currency by market cap, while investors wonder if it is already too expensive. According to some metrics, there is still a long way to go. Fast Adoption A major milestone in the institutionalization of Bitcoin has occurred recently. Arizona has approved its strategic Bitcoin reserve and will commit up to 10% of its $3.14 billion in assets to purchasing the cryptocurrency. The move could prompt other states to follow suit, and reinforces Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Adoption as a means of payment is also happening rapidly. Revolut, a European fintech with over 50 million customers, has announced that it will allow payments via the Bitcoin-based Lightning Network. As major players with large user bases adopt cryptocurrency as a means of payment, it becomes part of users' daily lives and gains strength as an alternative to the traditional payment system. This movement is also occurring among institutional investors. According to research, around 50 million Americans own Bitcoin, this number surpasses the 37 million gold investors. Bitcoin Is Becoming America's Reserve Asset (River) Investment Flow Soars The volume of investment in Bitcoin ETFs has skyrocketed in recent weeks and has already surpassed $900 million in a single week. This is a clear sign of institutional adoption in my view. BTC ETF Inflows (Zerohedge) Still talking about Bitcoin ETFs, the demand is so great that the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (NASDAQ: IBIT ) is among the top five ETFs in year-to-date inflows. The product has seen unimaginable adoption. Stand out from other assets After a recent price surge , Bitcoin has surpassed the market cap of Amazon, Alphabet and even silver. Bitcoin now has a market cap of over $2 trillion, reinforcing its structural relevance. Top Assets By Market Cap (companiesmarketcap) When compared to currencies, Bitcoin has surpassed the market value of the Taiwan dollar, and if it were considered a traditional currency, it would already be among the eight largest currencies in the world. Bitcoin surpassed Taiwan Dollar to Become the 8th Largest Currency in the World (ZeroHedge) Finally, respected investor Warren Buffett expressed his views on nations' fiscal policies. At his company's annual meeting, Buffett said he was concerned about governments' decisions to devalue their currencies. In this case, the concern of a major investor about the implications of fiscal irresponsibility by governments around the world is clear, and this is a major growth driver for Bitcoin, which corroborates the buy recommendation. Despite all the arguments listed above, many investors wonder whether they should still buy Bitcoin at these prices, and I will talk about price in the next chapter. Fair Price To reinforce the arguments above, we have the graph that compares the price of Bitcoin lagged by 10 weeks with the global money supply, which has been rising sharply driven by the US debt trajectory . We can see that the price of Bitcoin closely follows this global money supply, and based on the recent rally, the model suggests a target price for Bitcoin of $125,000 by the end of the first half of the year. Global M2 vs Bitcoin Lagged 10 weeks (Bonque) Another interesting metric is the price of Bitcoin and the average cost of mining. We can see that the price tends to stay above the cost of production, which makes this cost a \""floor\"". Let's see the chart below. BTC Price, Average Miner Breakeven Cost (Blockware) According to the chart, we could see the price of Bitcoin close to $200,000 by 2026, which supports my recommendation to buy Bitcoin. Although the outlook is very positive in my view, we need to understand the risks. Potential Threats To The Thesis Recently, Japanese authorities stated that they must adjust their debt as the cost is at extremely high levels. The reduction in Japanese bond issuance tends to improve the environment for trading bonds in other markets. This move by the Japanese government may be followed by other countries. If we have a global movement of austerity regarding its debt, we have a risk for the Bitcoin thesis. Finally, recent data shows that speculators have increased their shorts on bitcoin in recent weeks, likely expecting a price drop after hitting all-time highs. This could be a technical trigger for a short-term price drop. Speculators Increased Short Exposure in US Midcaps, Bitcoin (Bloomberg) The Bottom Line After a strong appreciation, many investors are wondering if there is room to buy Bitcoin, and as we saw in this article, I believe there is room for further increases. Institutional and retail investors have been rapidly adopting the cryptocurrency. When we analyze price projections, we have solid metrics such as price in relation to the global money supply or the cost of mining. Both point to Bitcoin exceeding $125,000 by the end of the year. Based on this analysis, I recommend buying Bitcoin. In my view, the risk-return ratio of the asset is still very attractive when we analyze it against other assets and currencies.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4790572-bitcointhis-investor-would-never-buy-but-he-gave-golden-tips-that-reinforce-the-thesis?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","BTC-USD",cryptocompare

In a recent post shared on X, EGRAG Crypto unveiled a refined interpretation of XRP’s bull flag formation, offering a set of price targets calculated using multiple analytical approaches. His insights shed light on how XRP’s long-term potential could unfold, especially as the asset navigates both technical patterns and the liquidity dynamics unique to the cryptocurrency market. Fine-Tuning the Bull Flag Formation According to EGRAG Crypto , the bull flag pattern currently forming on XRP’s chart has been slightly adjusted to more precisely align with the present bullish conditions. The bull flag is a classic technical pattern that often appears after a sharp upward move, followed by a period of sideways or slightly downward consolidation, which creates the “flag” portion. Once the asset breaks out of this consolidation, the measured move — or the distance the price is expected to travel post-breakout — can be estimated using several methods. #XRP – Bull Flag (Updated Version): Note : I’ve slightly adjusted the flag formation to perfectly match the current bullish setup and to estimate the measured move using different approaches. Logarithmic For long-term breakouts , I prefer using logarithmic charts ,… https://t.co/tf5SIoeekV pic.twitter.com/fhqweuOknf — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) May 28, 2025 EGRAG emphasizes the importance of using a logarithmic chart when analyzing crypto assets over the long term. Unlike linear charts, which show price movements in absolute terms, logarithmic charts account for percentage changes, making them particularly useful in markets like crypto, where exponential growth is common. For significant formations like XRP’s bull flag, the log approach can offer a more accurate reflection of breakout potential. Multiple Analytical Approaches In his updated breakdown, EGRAG applies three distinct methods to project XRP’s price target from the bull flag: the logarithmic (log) approach, the non-logarithmic (linear) approach, and an averaged estimate that balances the two. According to his findings, the logarithmic method points toward a breakout target of approximately $18 , while the linear (non-log) method produces a more conservative estimate of around $5.50. By averaging these two, EGRAG sets his preferred crypto target at $11.75, noting that this balanced figure accounts for liquidity variables unique to the cryptocurrency market, factors not as pronounced in traditional stock markets. Recognizing the unpredictable nature of crypto, EGRAG also applies a variability range of 15–20% to his targets. This means that, depending on liquidity conditions and market reactions, the average $11.75 target could extend upwards to around $13.51–$14.10 or, using the highest estimate, push the $18 projection up toward $20.70–$21.60. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Liquidity and Market Factors Matter EGRAG is careful to remind followers that crypto markets, compared to legacy financial markets, still operate with significantly smaller liquidity pools. This factor can amplify both gains and pullbacks, meaning price targets are not rigid markers but dynamic zones where variability is to be expected. While the measured moves provide a directional guide, real-world price action often stretches beyond or falls short of textbook targets, making flexibility and risk management crucial for traders. Currently, XRP’s price action is showing resilience, backed by bullish long-term formations and a community eager for the next big breakout . However, as always in crypto, the path to higher prices will not be a straight line. Corrections, volatility, and sudden market shifts can all emerge, particularly as broader market narratives evolve around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and macroeconomic forces. EGRAG Crypto’s updated analysis offers a detailed and thoughtful projection for XRP, framing the bull flag not just as a technical curiosity but as a potential roadmap for price evolution. With an average target of $11.75 , supported by both logarithmic and linear models, XRP holders and market watchers have a reference point as they navigate the coming months. As with all technical setups, success hinges not just on pattern recognition but also on the interplay of market sentiment, liquidity, and external catalysts. For now, though, XRP stands positioned within one of its most compelling bullish formations — and if EGRAG’s calculations prove accurate, a significant rally may well be on the horizon.

2025-05-28T18:18:41.000Z,"JD Vance Calls Crypto Market Structure Bill a ‘Priority’ for Trump Administration","LAS VEGAS, Nevada — Establishing a clear and pro-innovation regulatory framework for the crypto industry via a market structure bill is a priority for U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, Vice President J.D. Vance said Wednesday. Speaking to a massive crowd at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, Vance said that a regulatory framework is necessary to fully incorporate cryptocurrency into the mainstream U.S. economy, as well as to prevent future governments from rolling back the Trump administration’s crypto-friendly policies. “I hope that our party is in charge for a long time, but nothing is ever guaranteed in politics. So the best way to ensure that crypto is part of the mainstream economy is through a market structure bill that champions and doesn't restrict the extraordinary value that bitcoin and other digital assets represent,” Vance said at the event, which organizers said drew about 35,000 attendees. “We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to unleash innovation and use it to improve the lives of countless American citizens, but if we fail to create regulatory clarity now, we risk chasing this $3 trillion industry offshore in search of a friendlier jurisdiction, and President Trump is going to fight to fight to make sure that does not happen.” Vance said the Trump administration is hopeful that the GENIUS Act, the Senate’s stablecoin bill, will hit the president’s desk soon, allowing Congress to turn its attention to a market structure bill. He also said that the administration continues to work to “clean up the wreckage that the [Biden] administration left us,” including the so-called “regulation by enforcement” approach to crypto practiced by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under then-Chair Gary Gensler, and the widespread debanking of crypto companies, dubbed by the industry as Operation Chokepoint 2.0. “Operation Chokepoint 2.0 is dead and it’s not coming back under the Trump administration,” Vance said. “We reject the Biden administration's legacy of death by a thousand enforcement actions… We fired Gary Gensler, and we’re gonna fire everybody like him,\"" he added, though Gensler resigned the day Trump was sworn in Vance thanked the crypto industry, including Gemini’s Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss and Coinbase, for their early support of Trump’s campaign, attributing some of its success — as well as the successful elections of other crypto-friendly politicians like Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio) — to the crypto industry’s political support. “Take the momentum of your political involvement in 2024 and carry it forward into 2026 and beyond,” Vance said. In addition to urging the industry to stay involved in U.S. politics, Vance asked bitcoiners to stay abreast of developments in artificial intelligence (AI). “Remember that what happens in AI is very much going to affect, in good and bad ways, what happens to bitcoin and, of course, what happens to bitcoin is very much going to affect what happens in AI,” Vance said, adding: “Make sure you’re keeping tabs on and staying involved in what’s happening in artificial intelligence. I don’t want America to be negatively affected by what’s happening in AI, and the best way to ensure that smart people are at the AI conversation is to ensure that Bitcoin is part of the artificial intelligence conversation.”",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/05/28/jd-vance-calls-crypto-market-structure-bill-a-priority-for-trump-administration,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION","Policy|JD Vance|News",cryptocompare

The video game retailer, which became a viral sensation among traders in 2021, has announced that it has purchased 4,710 Bitcoin, valued at $513.4 billion at time of writing. GameStop is now the 13th largest holder of Bitcoin among publicly-traded companies. Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy) owns the largest Bitcoin corporate treasury in the world, with 580,250 BTC worth more than $62 billion at time of writing. GameStop’s BTC purchase comes less than two months after its board voted to become a Bitcoin treasury company, as part of the firm’s strategy to use its liquidity to maximize shareholder value. Said GameStop at the time, “On March 25, 2025, we announced that, as part of our revisions to the Investment Policy, the Board approved the addition of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, alongside US dollar-denominated stablecoins, to diversify the Company’s investment portfolio… a portion of our cash or future debt and equity issuances may be invested in Bitcoin. We have not set a maximum amount of Bitcoin we may accumulate, and may sell any Bitcoin we may acquire.” A new report by the crypto asset manager Bitwise shows that publicly-traded companies are increasingly investing in Bitcoin, with collective holdings increasing from 394,131 to 786,857 BTC over the six-month period from November 15th, 2024 to May 15th, 2025.

2025-05-28T18:04:09.000Z,"Bitcoin Bulls Eye New Record Highs as Ethereum Faces Crucial Test at $2,800 — Technical Analysis Reveals Next Moves","Bitcoin is on the verge of new peaks , while Ethereum confronts a pivotal challenge at $2,800. Updated technical charts reveal the possible directions for these top cryptocurrencies. The next few moves could define their near-term futures. Stay tuned for insights on which digital assets are set to rise. Bitcoin Sees Upward Movement While Signals Remain Uncertain Bitcoin has grown by 16.24% in just the past month and gained 13.98% over the last six months. The steady ascent over these periods reflects a reliable rally and renewed buyer interest. Price action has shown incremental strength that hints at ongoing investor support and a balanced risk appetite in recent sessions. Bitcoin now trades between $80,410 and $101,882. Key support is holding around $66,665 and resistance is near $109,610, with secondary levels at roughly $45,193 and $131,083 respectively. Bulls seem active within this range, though indicators offer mixed views. Traders may look for breakouts or retests of these levels as the trend continues to test its strength. Ethereum Price Analysis: Key Support and Resistance Levels Ethereum delivered a notable monthly gain of 47.27% while struggling with a 26.27% decline over the past six months. A weekly rise of 4.59% punctuated this period, hinting at short-term recovery amid longer-term setbacks. Price swings reflected a blend of investor optimism and caution, creating an environment where rapid monthly momentum contrasts with deeper underlying challenges. The coin currently trades between $1468.66 and $2037.85. Immediate resistance stands at $2280.82 with support nearest at $1142.44, while a second set of key levels appears at $2850.01 and $573.25. Bulls seem to be pushing against these barriers, though mixed oscillator signals suggest no clear trend. Traders might consider targeted buys around support and exits near resistance levels. Conclusion BTC is approaching new record highs, showing strong bullish momentum. Meanwhile, ETH is facing a key resistance level at $2,800. A successful break could lead to significant gains for ETH. The overall outlook suggests that BTC may continue to rise, while ETH’s performance will depend on its ability to surpass this crucial level.

2025-05-28T17:40:26.000Z,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) Consolidates Within a Triangle: Analyst Predicts Breakout with Price Target","Shiba Inu (SHIB), one of the most closely watched meme coins in the crypto market, has entered a phase of tight price consolidation, according to on-chain and chart analyst Ali, who shared his insights on social media platform X. Ali highlights that SHIB’s price action has been narrowing within a well-defined triangle formation, a classic technical setup that often precedes a significant breakout. Based on the current structure, Ali anticipates a potential 17% price movement once SHIB breaks free from this pattern. Triangle Consolidation Signals Incoming Volatility The triangle formation Ali refers to is a symmetrical triangle characterized by converging trendlines that squeeze prices into a tightening range. This type of pattern usually reflects a balance between buyers and sellers, with neither side gaining a decisive edge—until a breakout eventually disrupts the equilibrium. #ShibaInu $SHIB consolidates within a triangle, awaiting a 17% price move! pic.twitter.com/jdjMzVxtme — Ali (@ali_charts) May 28, 2025 Over the past several weeks, SHIB has been moving within this symmetrical triangle, compressing toward its apex. Historical price behavior and technical analysis suggest that such setups often resolve in sharp directional moves, as pent-up market pressure is unleashed. While symmetrical triangles can break either up or down, the context of SHIB’s recent price action leans toward an optimistic scenario, especially if broader market sentiment remains supportive. Ali’s analysis pinpoints a 17% potential price shift once SHIB breaks out of this consolidation phase. This projection is based on measuring the triangle’s height and applying it to the expected breakout direction. If SHIB breaks upward, the token could reclaim higher resistance zones, while a downward move would likely test critical support levels. SHIB’s Recent Performance and Market Context At the time of writing, SHIB is trading slightly lower, reflecting the broader crypto market’s cautious mood. Despite this, the meme coin remains resilient, with its large and dedicated community, dubbed the “SHIB Army,” continuing to drive engagement and awareness across social platforms. Beyond technical setups, SHIB’s performance is also influenced by key ecosystem developments. Recent updates within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, including the ongoing expansion of Shibarium, the project’s Layer 2 blockchain, and increased burn mechanisms aimed at reducing the circulating supply, have kept sentiment elevated. These fundamentals provide a backdrop of optimism that could support a bullish breakout once technical conditions align. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What Comes Next for SHIB? While Ali’s projection offers a clear technical price target, traders and investors should remember that no pattern guarantees a particular outcome. Market catalysts, such as broader Bitcoin and Ethereum moves, macroeconomic shifts, or shifts in risk appetite, can all influence SHIB’s direction. Nevertheless, the symmetrical triangle serves as a reliable guidepost for anticipating volatility. Should SHIB break above the upper trendline with strong volume confirmation, the meme coin could be poised for a swift rally that aligns with the 17% upside Ali envisions. Conversely, a break below support would likely trigger a defensive phase, where the SHIB community watches closely to defend key lower levels. Shiba Inu’s current technical picture , as outlined by analyst Ali, paints a compelling narrative of a market in waiting. The consolidation phase within the symmetrical triangle suggests that SHIB is building pressure for its next significant move, with a 17% price swing on the horizon. As always, traders should approach the coming days with a combination of technical insight, market awareness, and risk management, recognizing that while patterns can offer valuable clues, the crypto market’s inherent volatility demands careful navigation. For now, all eyes remain on SHIB’s triangle boundaries — and the potential breakout that could soon redefine its short-term trajectory.

2025-05-28T17:39:41.000Z,"Top Mining Providers:8 Best Free Bitcoin Cloud Mining Platforms Trusted by Global Crypto Investors in 2025","In 2025, Litecoin and Dogecoin have become primary targets for cloud miners . With faster block times, lower transaction costs, and less volatility than Bitcoin, these altcoins offer a balanced alternative for miners seeking stability and frequent payouts. Litecoin's strong technical foundation and Dogecoin's active community support have made both attractive for diversified mining portfolios. Cloud mining of these coins appeals especially to users who want regular income without the complexity of managing ASIC rigs or paying for electricity. Platforms offering low-cost or no-cost entry and daily payouts are leading the market. 1.QFSCOIN: Leading Bitcoin Cloud Mining Platforms in 2025 QFSCOIN ranks #1 among Bitcoin and Dogecoin cloud mining services in 2025. Its unique offering includes a free $30 sign-up bonus, zero hardware requirements, and instant daily payouts. QFSCOIN allows users to mine Litecoin and Dogecoin alongside Bitcoin, with automated contract execution and fixed return rates. The free contract returns $0.90 daily on a $30 credit, providing a 3% ROI within 24 hours. Higher-tier packages increase daily ROI up to 9%. For example, a $10,000 contract over 6 days returns $5,400. Payouts are automatic, and mining operations are spread across secure data centers in the U.S., Canada, Norway, and Iceland. Contract Price Contract Term Fixed Return Daily Rate $30 (Free) 1 Day $30 + $0.90 3.00% $100 2 Days $100 + $5 2.50% $300 2 Days $300 + $19.2 3.20% $1,200 3 Days $1,200 + $144 4.00% $3,500 3 Days $3,500 + $630 6.00% $10,000 6 Days $10,000 + $5,400 9.00% QFSCOIN supports multi-coin mining using advanced AI-powered resource allocation. Its security framework includes SSL encryption, DDoS protection, and a proprietary risk management system. User feedback highlights ease of use, instant registration, and consistent earnings as core strengths.

Enhanced security with SSL and DDoS protection. Daily automated payouts. Free mining package available. A wide range of cryptocurrency contracts. 24/7 customer support. No additional costs for electricity. $30 registration bonus. Website: https://qfscoin.com Twitter: https://x.com/qfscoin YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@qfscoin 2.ECOS ECOS supports Litecoin mining through customizable contracts hosted in Armenia's Free Economic Zone. While primarily focused on Bitcoin, it offers Litecoin contracts for users seeking diversification. Daily returns range from 2% to 2.3%, depending on contract settings like duration and investment size. The platform is regulated, offers a built-in wallet and exchange, and provides detailed performance metrics. However, ECOS does not support Dogecoin mining and lacks promotional offers. Its structured approach suits long-term investors but is less beginner-friendly due to contract complexity. 3.NiceHash NiceHash operates as a hash power marketplace, offering mining flexibility for multiple altcoins, including Litecoin and Dogecoin. Users can rent hash power or provide it. The platform supports Scrypt, which is the mining algorithm for both LTC and DOGE. ROI varies by market demand but typically ranges from 1.8% to 2.5% daily. NiceHash allows users to switch coins based on profitability, providing an advantage for miners chasing returns. While powerful, its interface and pricing structure require technical knowledge, making it better for advanced users. 4.BitFuFu BitFuFu is backed by Bitmain and offers high-performance Litecoin mining contracts. It doesn’t support Dogecoin directly but allows Litecoin mining using dedicated SHA-256 and Scrypt rigs. Daily returns are among the highest in the market, ranging from 2.8% to 3.5%. There are no free plans or bonuses, and the minimum deposit is $100. Contracts are fixed-term with high uptime, and the platform offers real-time hash rate monitoring. BitFuFu is ideal for miners seeking professional-grade Litecoin output but is not suitable for Dogecoin miners or casual users. 5.CCG Mining CCG Mining is a European cloud provider offering multi-coin mining, including Litecoin. The platform offers fixed-return contracts with stable infrastructure. Daily ROI averages 2.1%, and payouts are processed every 24 hours. Dogecoin is not natively supported. Its strengths include transparency and reliability, but its lack of flexibility and beginner support holds it back. CCG Mining is more suited for institutional users or those seeking slow, steady gains from Litecoin mining. 6.MinerGate MinerGate supports both Litecoin and Dogecoin through its pool and cloud mining services. Daily ROI is variable, averaging between 1.5% and 2.0%, depending on network difficulty and mining success. The platform uses smart mining to auto-switch to the most profitable coins. While offering broad altcoin support, MinerGate’s UI feels outdated, and performance metrics are limited. It remains functional but lacks the automated simplicity offered by newer platforms like QFSCOIN. 7.StormGain StormGain offers free cloud mining for Bitcoin within its mobile trading app, but does not natively support Litecoin or Dogecoin mining. However, it remains popular for users who want to trade altcoins while mining small amounts of Bitcoin passively. The miner pays out around 0.5% daily, and earnings depend on trading volume. While innovative, StormGain lacks serious altcoin mining capacity, and Dogecoin/Litecoin miners would find better options elsewhere. 8.Binance Cloud Mining Binance Cloud Mining supports Bitcoin but does not currently offer Litecoin or Dogecoin contracts. Its appeal lies in platform trust and ease of integration with Binance wallets and trading features. Users can convert mined BTC into LTC or DOGE manually. Payouts are processed daily, and average ROI is 2.8%. Despite the platform’s credibility and ease of use, its lack of native Litecoin/Dogecoin mining makes it less relevant for altcoin miners. Summary Table: Altcoin Mining Performance in 2025 Platform LTC Support DOGE Support Avg. Daily ROI Free Plan Entry Cost Ease of Use 1.QFSCOIN Yes Yes 3.0% - 9.0% Yes $0 (Free) Excellent 2.ECOS Yes No ~2.3% No $100 Moderate 3.NiceHash Yes Yes 1.8% - 2.5% No $50 Moderate 4.BitFuFu Yes No 2.8% - 3.5% No $100 Moderate 5.CCG Mining Yes No ~2.1% No $100 Low 6.MinerGate Yes Yes 1.5% - 2.0% No $50 Moderate 7.StormGain No No ~0.5% (BTC) Yes $0 Good 8.Binance Cloud No No ~2.8% (BTC) No $100 Excellent Final Verdict: Best Altcoin Mining Platform for 2025 For users interested in mining Litecoin and Dogecoin in 2025, QFSCOIN is the most balanced and accessible option. It supports both coins, requires no initial capital, and offers daily ROI as high as 9%. The free trial, daily payouts, and multi-coin support position it ahead of other platforms in both profitability and ease of use. Platforms like BitFuFu and ECOS are viable for Litecoin-focused miners but exclude Dogecoin. NiceHash offers flexibility for dual-coin mining but is better suited to experienced users. MinerGate and BeMine provide altcoin options with trade-offs in UI or returns. QFSCOIN’s strong daily performance, free starting point, and automated mining execution make it the most efficient cloud mining platform for Litecoin and Dogecoin in 2025.

With key confluences at support, the stage is set for a potential surge toward the channel high. Despite current market-wide corrections, Floki ( Floki ) has shown notable resilience. Price action remains bullish, as it continues to move within a rising trading channel that has held since March. This structure has consistently produced higher highs and higher lows, with price respecting the lower boundary of the channel on multiple occasions. Each retest has resulted in a bounce, reinforcing this zone as a critical support level. Currently, Floki is bouncing from a confluence of major technical indicators, including the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, the dynamic lower channel support, and the 200-day moving average. These technical alignments signal a high-probability trade location that offers significant upside potential if the support holds. Key technical points Dynamic Channel Support: Price is respecting the ascending trading channel since March, with multiple touches validating trend direction. 0.618 Fibonacci & 200 MA Confluence: Both key indicators are aligning near current price, offering strong technical support. Volume Profile Decline: As price trades into support, volume is contracting—typical before a breakout or continuation. FLOKIUSDT (4H) Source: TradingView Floki’s market structure remains intact and bullish. The formation of consecutive higher highs and higher lows confirms that bulls are still in control, even as the broader market experiences short-term weakness. The key test now is whether the current support zone, backed by multiple technical indicators, can hold. If it does, Floki is well-positioned for a continuation move toward the channel high. A breakout from that level would open the door for a projected 40% rally. The declining volume is also noteworthy. This pattern is common during tests of strong support, as market participants wait for confirmation. A volume expansion accompanying a bounce from this zone would likely confirm renewed buying interest and trigger the next leg higher.

A decisive breakdown, however, would mark a potential trend shift and could invalidate the ascending channel structure. What to expect in the coming price action If Floki holds above this confluence of support, expect a bounce and continued movement toward the channel high. A confirmed breakout above that level could trigger a 40% rally in the short to mid-term.

Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) price dropped to $33.4, down by 15% from its highest point this month. HYPE entered a correction for two main reasons. First, the pullback followed a sharp rally of over 330% from its April low, which had made it one of the top-performing tokens in the crypto market. It is common for a surging asset to retrace as investors take profits. The decline also reflects the concept of mean reversion, in which price returns toward its long-term moving averages after extreme moves in either direction. Second, HYPE price dropped as the recent crypto market rally faded. Bitcoin ( BTC ) fell to $107,400, one week after hitting a record high near $112,000. Meanwhile, the total crypto market cap dropped to $3.39 trillion. You might also like: No VC, $1B Trades, and a 300% Rally — what makes Hyperliquid crypto tick? Falling crypto prices affect HYPE because it may affect the volume on its platform. This trend has yet to reflect on Hyperliquid, where the daily volume rose by 62% to $11.25 billion. Still, there are signs that the HYPE price will bounce back because of its market share in the perpetual futures market. It has handled transactions worth over $37 billion in the last seven days, much higher than Jupiter, Vertex Edge, and MYX Finance combined. HYPE price technical analysis HYPE price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the HYPE price bottomed at $9.3370 in April and then rebounded to a record high of $39.88 this month. It formed a cup-and-handle pattern whose upper side was at $28.31. Since this cup had a depth of approximately 66%, measuring the same distance from the top of the cup projects a target of $47. The most likely scenario is that HYPE drops 15%, retests the $28.31 breakout zone, and then resumes its uptrend toward the $47 target. This pattern is known as a break-and-retest, where an asset breaks resistance, retests it as support, and continues in the direction of the original breakout.

SELF-SPREADING MALWARE FOUND IN PRIVACY CRYPTO DERO: A newly discovered Linux malware campaign is compromising unsecured Docker infrastructure worldwide, turning exposed servers into part of a decentralized cryptojacking network that mines the privacy coin Dero. According to a report by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, the attack begins by exploiting publicly exposed Docker APIs. In software terms, a docker is a set of applications or platform tools that delivers software in small packages called containers. Once access is gained, the malware spawns malicious containers. It infects already-running ones, siphoning system resources to mine Dero and scan for additional targets without requiring a central command server. As of early May, over 520 Docker APIs were publicly exposed over port 2375 worldwide — each one a potential target. — Shaurya Malwa Read more .

In a new interview with CNBC, Minneapolis Fed leader Neel Kashkari says he’s been having concerning discussions with small and big businesses across his region. “The most common comment that I get is that they are uncertain about the outlook, so they’re nervous about making new investment decisions. Even businesses have said to me, if they knew where the tariff would ultimately settle, then they could adjust their supply chains around that new environment. That all else being equal, they may want to lower tariffs, but wherever they settle, they could adjust to that. But right now, there’s still so much uncertainty as the negotiations are continuing. A lot of businesses are on hold, and if businesses and consumers are on hold, that introduces downside risk for the economy, potentially even recession risk.” Last week, Kashkari’s fellow Fed President Austan Goolsbee, who leads the Chicago bank, warned that President Donald Trump’s policy choices could lead to an unfavorable economic environment known as stagflation, which is dominated by stagnant economic growth, high inflation and high unemployment. If the Fed is eventually faced with twin threats of persistent inflation and a weakening economy, Kashkari argues the central bank should prioritize the fight against inflation. “For me, because inflation in the US and around most countries in the world, most advanced economies… has been elevated for four years, I’m very nervous that eventually inflation expectations might lose their anchor to that 2% target that we have. If inflation had been running at 2% or below for the last four years, I would be more comfortable, quote unquote, looking through this one-time tariff-induced inflation. But because inflation has been running hot for four years, that makes me nervous, and that makes me want to err towards protecting and defending the inflation anchor of 2%.” ?

2025-05-28T16:55:03.000Z,"Ethereum, Bitcoin price headed for another rally: Bitfinex analyst","Bitfinex analyst Jag Kooner believes that Bitcoin and Ethereum are driven by the macroeconomic environment, which is pushing them to new highs. Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) may be heading for another move higher. According to Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, the current macroeconomic environment is favorable for digital assets. In particular, traders are looking at Federal Reserve guidance and consumer spending data, the Bitfinex analyst shared in a note with crypto.news on May 28. For one, the Fed is under pressure from the potential inflationary effects of tariffs. If the Fed is worried about this, Kooner expects the rates will likely stay at their current level. However, core personal consumption expenditures may have a more direct impact on the dollar. You might also like: Bitcoin cements its haven asset reputation. Is the “means of exchange” narrative still alive? “The Core PCE data on Friday will be the most binary macro event. Market pricing expects stability; any downside surprise below 2.6% y/y (core) will trigger a compression in real yields and dollar softness, catalyzing capital back into crypto,” Jag Kooner, Bitfinex. If the dollar falls, traders will be looking for other assets to protect their wealth. In this context, Bitcoin is a strong option. Kooner notes that institutional inflows are strong, with $1 billion net inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs on the week ending on Sunday, May 25. You might also like: EXCLUSIVE: ETH Foundation lead Aya Miyaguchi on the origins of UNICEF’s bold crypto move Is Bitcoin, Ethereum price set for another rally? Notably, Ethereum may be driving the altcoin rally, suggests Kooner, noting that ETH was up 6% against BTC off local lows. What is more, Kooner states that this is not driven by retail demand, but more institutional interest. “This is the beginning of what might become Phase 3 of the crypto bull cycle, where BTC strength stabilizes, ETH accelerates, and capital spreads out across selective altcoins,” Kooner noted about Ethereum’s recent growth. Still, the timing of the potential rally will likely depend on the macro environment. If the Fed minutes and the PCE are favorable, this could trigger another rally. “The underlying takeaway for traders: crypto isn’t overbought, it’s underallocated—macro just decides how quickly capital flows in,” he concluded.

2025-05-28T16:35:00.000Z,"Coinbase data breach 2025: What was stolen and what you need to know","Background of Coinbase’s May 2025 breach              Coinbase, America’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, received an unsolicited email from an unknown threat actor on May 11, 2025. They claimed to possess sensitive information about its customers and demanded a ransom of $20 million. Before examining the breach, it is interesting to understand how it happened at a public company that spends millions monthly on cybersecurity. In February, blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported increased thefts involving Coinbase users. He blamed aggressive risk models and pointed out Coinbase’s failure to prevent $300 million in yearly losses from social engineering scams. A table ZachXBT shared on X showed $65 million stolen from users between December 2024 and January 2025. He also said the real losses could be higher, as his data only came from his direct messages about onchain thefts, and excluded Coinbase support tickets and police reports he couldn’t access. The fear of cybercriminals stealing valuable information came true on May 11 when Coinbase published a blog post confirming that account balances, ID images, phone numbers, home addresses and partially hidden bank details were stolen during the data breach.On May 21, the same threat actor swapped about $42.5 million from Bitcoin (BTC) to Ether (ETH) via THORChain. They used Ethereum transaction input data to write “L bozo,” following it with a meme video of NBA player James Worthy smoking a cigar, seemingly mocking ZachXBT, who later flagged the message on his Telegram channel.                  What happened: Timeline of the Coinbase breach              The 2025 Coinbase breach wasn’t a typical crypto hack involving smart contracts or blockchain vulnerabilities. Instead, it was like a traditional IT security failure, marked by insider manipulation, corporate espionage and an extortion attempt.Below is a breakdown of how the incident unfolded:Insider recruitment and information theft began: To steal information from Coinbase, unknown cyber attackers began recruiting some overseas customer service agents (based in India) working for Coinbase. These insiders were paid to leak sensitive customer data and internal documentation, particularly that around customer service and account management systems. The stolen information was intended for future impersonation scams targeting users.Security detection and employee termination: Coinbase’s internal security team eventually detected suspicious activity linked to these employees. The involved staff were swiftly terminated, and the company alerted affected users. Though just 69,461 accounts were impacted, a fraction of Coinbase’s user base, the depth of stolen personal data made the breach significant.Extortion attempt via email (May 11, 2025): Coinbase received an unsolicited email claiming to possess internal system details and personally identifiable information (PII). This was later confirmed as credible in an 8-K SEC filing. Coinbase refuses to pay $20M ransom (May 14, 2025): Rather than accepting extortion, Coinbase flipped the script. The company reported the breach to law enforcement, disclosed it publicly and offered a $20 million reward for information leading to the attackers’ arrest, turning defense into offense. Breach disclosure and public notification: Shortly after the SEC filing, Coinbase publicly confirmed the breach, clarifying the scope and nature of the attack. A data breach notification was filed with the Maine Attorney General’s office, officially stating 69,461 users were affected. This timeline reflects how a crypto company responded differently to an attempted cyber-extortion, with transparency, resistance and bold countermeasures. This may bring in a change in the way companies respond to threats from cyber criminals.Did you know? North Korea’s Lazarus Group has stolen over $6 billion in crypto since 2017, including a record-breaking $1.46 billion from Bybit in 2025.                   What data was compromised in the Coinbase data breach in 2025?              According to a notification letter issued by Coinbase, attackers sought this information because they planned to launch social engineering attacks. The information they stole could help them appear credible to victims and possibly convince them to move their funds.Coinbase detailed the information the threat actors had got access to and what they could not. What attackers gotName, address, phone, and emailGovernment‑ID images (e.g., driver’s license, passport)Masked Social Security (last four digits only)Account data (balance snapshots and transaction history)Masked bank account numbers and some bank account identifiersLimited corporate data (including documents, training material, and communications available to support agents)What attackers couldn’t getLogin credentials or 2FA codesPrivate keysAccess to Coinbase Prime accountsAny ability to move or access customer fundsAccess to any Coinbase or Coinbase customer hot or cold walletsDid you know? In 2022, Crypto.com lost $30 million from 483 accounts. Initially, they claimed no funds were stolen, but later admitted the breach and refunded victims, highlighting the importance of transparency in crypto hacks.                  How Coinbase responded to the 2025 criminal data breach              In response to the 2025 data breach, Coinbase implemented a comprehensive strategy to mitigate damage, support affected users and strengthen its security infrastructure.Key actions taken by Coinbase included:Refusal to pay ransom: Coinbase declined the $20 million ransom demanded by the attackers. Instead, the company established a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.Customer reimbursements: The company committed to reimbursing customers who were deceived into sending funds due to the breach. Estimated costs for remediation and reimbursements range between $180 million and $400 million.Theft protection services: The company is providing all affected individuals with one year of complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services. This includes credit monitoring, a $1 million insurance reimbursement policy, identity restoration services, and dark web monitoring to detect if any personal information appears on illicit online platforms.Enhanced customer safeguards: Affected accounts will require additional ID verification for large withdrawals, including mandatory scam-awareness prompts to prevent further social engineering attacks.Strengthened support operations: Coinbase is opening a new support hub in the US. It has implemented stronger security controls and monitoring across all locations to prevent insider threats.Collaboration with law enforcement: The company is cooperating closely with US and international law enforcement agencies. Insiders involved in the breach were terminated and referred for criminal prosecution.Transparency and communication: Coinbase immediately notified affected customers once the breach was recognized. It is providing ongoing updates about the breach and the steps being taken to address it.These measures reflected Coinbase's commitment to customer protection and its proactive approach to cybersecurity challenges.Did you know? Crosschain bridges, like Nomad Bridge, lost $190 million in 2022 due to complex smart contract vulnerabilities. These bridges are hacker favorites because they store massive crypto assets, making them lucrative targets.                  How to stay safe in the event of Coinbase-like data breaches              In the wake of large-scale data breaches of crypto platforms, you should take proactive steps to protect yourself from social engineering attacks. Here is how you could stay safe in such an event:Never share sensitive information with impersonators: Scammers often pose as support staff or security agents after a breach. They may push you toward moving funds to crypto wallets they share with you or revealing sensitive information under various texts. Never share your password, two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, or recovery phrases with such impersonators. No crypto exchange will ask you to transfer crypto to a “new” or “safe” wallet. Turn on allow-listing of wallet addresses: Some exchanges provide this feature, which restricts withdrawals to pre-approved wallet addresses you fully control. This prevents unauthorized transfers even if your account is compromised. Enable strong 2FA: For 2FA, use a hardware security key or a trusted authentication app. Avoid relying on SMS-based 2FA, which is vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks. Be cautious with unsolicited communication: Hang up immediately if someone calls claiming to be from a crypto platform and asks for security credentials or requests asset transfers. Do not respond to unknown texts or emails with your personal information. Lock first, investigate later: If anything feels suspicious, lock your account immediately through the app or platform and report the incident to customer support via official channels. Stay informed: Regularly review security tips and updates from your crypto services to recognize and avoid evolving scam tactics.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/coinbase-data-breach-2025-what-was-stolen-and-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-28T15:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the industry’s most overlooked asset","Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin DepotA new proposal to install Bitcoin ATMs in federal buildings highlights an important question: Can crypto truly go mainstream without a stronger physical presence? For years, the industry has focused on software and decentralization, but its reluctance to invest in real-world infrastructure is starting to show. Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be.Everyone loves to talk about decentralization. There’s a good reason behind this. It defines the movement, shapes the technology, and supports the vision of a better financial system. While the industry focuses on code and algorithms, it lacks something basic. A decentralized system that exists only online is not genuinely decentralized.Physical infrastructure is the missing linkBitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the missing link. Without tools like ATMs, kiosks and access points at traditional retail locations, crypto remains out of reach for millions. Decentralization is not just about removing intermediaries. True decentralization requires expanding access. Without real-world touchpoints, even the most advanced network becomes limited to a closed circle of insiders.Recent: Arizona governor kills two crypto bills, cracks down on Bitcoin ATMsFor crypto to become mainstream, it must be easy to reach digitally and physically. That means showing up in places people already go and seamlessly integrating into people’s lives. Many groups in the American population still rely on cash or don’t have access to traditional banks. According to the latest Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation report, around 5.6 million American households don’t have a bank or savings account. Bitcoin ATMs give these users access without needing an app, a bank account or a crash course in blockchain. Most crypto tools today assume a level of financial fluency and infrastructure that millions simply do not have. The result is a digital-only ecosystem that locks out newcomers and widens the divide between early adopters and everyone else.User-friendly screen in the right placePhysical infrastructure helps address this issue. A Bitcoin ATM in a grocery store or gas station is not just a convenience but a bridge to financial inclusion. It is an invitation to someone who has never bought crypto, telling them they can participate. No bank, no broker, just a user-friendly screen in a familiar place.These machines also generate new economic activity. Local businesses benefit from increased foot traffic as the kiosks create passive revenue. For many communities, they provide access to a parallel financial system that was previously out of reach. This is a tangible example of crypto’s real-world utility. It is already happening, and it is measurable.The crypto industry’s blind spotThe industry often treats physical infrastructure like an afterthought. The obsession with building new digital solutions has created a blind spot. Innovation without usability builds systems that serve the few but exclude the many. If someone can buy Bitcoin (BTC) at the same place they buy their morning coffee, that is when crypto stops feeling like an obscure digital asset and starts becoming part of everyday life.As governments increase regulation, trusted and transparent interfaces will become more important. When operated within regulatory frameworks, Bitcoin ATMs offer a way to provide access between traditional finance and digital assets. They are familiar, easy to monitor and offer a more approachable entry point for the general public.Like any financial tool, Bitcoin ATMs have drawn scrutiny, particularly in cases where bad actors use them. Rather than dismissing the machines themselves, we should focus on investing in better oversight, stronger consumer education and smarter regulation. The overwhelming majority of people who use Bitcoin ATMs do so for legitimate reasons: to send remittances, to move money securely or to access digital assets without traditional banking barriers. Building trust does not mean avoiding or dismantling physical access, but improving it.The first time someone uses Bitcoin should not involve reading a white paper or navigating a tutorial. It should be as familiar as using an ATM or tapping a payment terminal. This is not an argument against innovation. Software and protocols will continue to evolve and play an important role. Physical infrastructure provides something those tools cannot: trust through presence. When people can see and use crypto in their neighborhood, at a store they already visit or in a format they already understand, it changes how they think about crypto and who it is for. According to Coin ATM Radar, there are over 30,000 Bitcoin ATMs in the US. It’s a meaningful start, but still only a small step toward widespread access. Crypto’s long-term success will depend not just on innovation but also on inclusion. That means building more than networks; it means building presence. When people can interact with crypto in the physical world, it stops being abstract and becomes usable. That is how digital finance becomes everyday finance.Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin Depot.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Source: EY-ParthenonInstitutional participation in DeFi is set to triple over the next two years to 75% from 24% of 350 surveyed institutional investors, according to management consulting firm EY-Parthenon.To tackle the growing institutional liquidity needs, Katana’s liquidity pool is composed of multiple protocols, including lending protocol Morpho, decentralized exchange (DEX) Sushi and perpetual DEX Vertex, enabling users to trade “blue-chip assets” without needing crosschain transfers.Katana has also incorporated Conduit’s sequences and Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network.Related: Polygon CEO: DeFi must ditch hype for sustainable liquidityKatana to compound DeFi yield from “Ethereum-based opportunities”Katana aims to boost sustainable yield by building a cohesive DeFi ecosystem. For instance, VaultBridge deploys bridged assets into overcollateralized, curated lending strategies on Ethereum via Mopho to earn yield, which is routed back and compounded on Katana.The protocol will reinvest network fees and a portion of application revenue back into its ecosystem.“This reduces reliance on short-term incentives, generates consistent yield, and as it grows, acts as an increasingly stable backstop during periods of volatility and liquidity shocks,” Polygon Labs’ Boiron told Cointelegraph, adding:“Yield is distributed pro-rata to each chain using VaultBridge protocol based on their share of total deposits into VaultBridge.”“So if Katana supplies 20% of the total vault deposits, it receives 20% of the yield back,” he added.Katana will subsequently allocate its share of yield to users through boosted DeFi incentives across “core apps” such as Sushi, Morpho or Vertex. The yield is generated from “Ethereum-based opportunities and then enhanced through Katana’s core applications,” said Boiron.Polygon Labs’ CEO previously criticized DeFi protocols for fueling a cycle of “mercenary capital” by offering sky-high annual percentage yields (APYs) through token emissions. Beyond infrastructure-related limitations, regulatory uncertainty remains another significant barrier to institutional DeFi adoption.2025 Institutional Investor Digital Assets Survey.

2025-05-28T14:15:00.000Z,"Elderly crypto investors are getting scammed: Teach them these key safety tips","Why are seniors being targeted in crypto scams?              Scammers prey on seniors because they view them as financially secure, trusting and less familiar with rapidly evolving technology.Let’s understand why seniors are key targets.Perception of wealth: Many older adults have retirement savings or pensions, making them lucrative targets.Lower tech fluency: Navigating crypto wallets, private keys and blockchain concepts can be intimidating, something scammers exploit.Embarrassment prevents reporting: Victims often feel ashamed, making them less likely to report the crime.Crypto is irreversible: Once funds are sent via Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, there’s no reversing the transaction. That’s a dream scenario for scammers.According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), seniors report growing losses linked to cryptocurrency investment fraud, romance scams and government impersonation. In South Carolina’s Beaufort County alone, seniors reported over $3.1 million in crypto scam losses in 2024.And these scams are becoming more sophisticated. AI tools can now clone voices, spoof caller IDs and create fake websites that mimic legitimate exchanges or financial institutions to steal from unsuspecting seniors.                  Examples of crypto scams targeting older adults              From crypto romance fraud in Cambodia targeting British pensioners to ATM scams in Minnesota and impersonation schemes across the US, scammers have stolen millions by preying on older adults’ trust and unfamiliarity with digital assets.1. Cambodian scam compounds exploiting British pensionersIn Bavet, Cambodia, scam compounds operated by networks linked to the Chinese mafia have been uncovered. These operations enslave trafficked workers, forcing them to participate in romance and cryptocurrency fraud. British pensioners have been prime targets, suffering significant losses.. One victim from the West Midlands lost over 250,000 British pounds ($340,000). These scams often employ “pig-butchering” tactics, cultivating trust online before executing large-scale financial fraud.2. Crypto ATM scams in MinnesotaIn Minnesota, over 5,500 incidents involving cryptocurrency kiosks led to losses exceeding $189 million in 2023. Seniors were the most vulnerable victims, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the stolen funds. Scammers often direct victims to transfer funds using QR codes tied to fraudulent accounts. Cities like Stillwater have implemented bans on crypto ATMs to protect residents.3. Romance scam targeting a disabled woman in the UKLisa Nock, a 44-year-old woman from Staffordshire with autism and mobility issues, fell victim to a romance scam after being targeted on Instagram by someone impersonating Australian TV vet Dr. Chris Brown. Over 18 months, the scammer manipulated her into transferring £11,000 in cryptocurrency, claiming the funds were for flights, visas and hiring a substitute vet. Lisa eventually realized the deceit and reported the fraud to authorities.4. Government or bank impersonators demanding crypto paymentsScammers may impersonate the IRS, Social Security Administration, Medicare or local law enforcement. Their script is simple: You’re in legal trouble or owe back taxes, and the only way to avoid arrest or penalties is to pay in Bitcoin.This tactic has been used across the US. In South Carolina, a retired healthcare worker named Marianne was told she missed jury duty and owed $7,500. Following fake sheriff’s instructions, she fed the cash into a Coinstar crypto ATM, which instantly converted her money to Bitcoin and sent it straight to scammers.5. Ohio woman loses life savings in cryptocurrency investment scam An Ohio woman lost her life savings in a cryptocurrency investment scam that defrauded victims of about $4.9 million. The scheme involved 33 identified victims nationwide, with five more accounts under FBI investigation.Did you know? A $243 million Bitcoin heist involving a fake Google call spiraled into a real-world kidnapping plot straight out of a Netflix thriller.                  7 Key safety tips every elderly crypto investor should know              Elderly investors should follow key safety steps like never sending crypto to strangers, verifying suspicious contacts, enabling two-factor authentication, avoiding public WiFi and discussing large transactions with trusted family before acting.Here are the key safety tips every elderly crypto investor should be aware of:Never send crypto to strangers: If someone you’ve never met in person asks for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies,  it’s almost certainly a scam. This includes social media, messages on Facebook, emails from supposed tech support or even someone you’ve been chatting with on a dating site. No legitimate person or organization will randomly ask for crypto. If you’re being told, “Send me $500 and I’ll send back $1,000,” you’re being conned. Always assume unsolicited crypto requests are fraudulent.Double-check all contacts: If you get a call, email, or text from a bank, the IRS or even a family member in crisis, don’t respond immediately. Call the official number on your bank card or government website to verify.Use trusted wallets and exchanges only: Stick to platforms with strong security and regulation like Coinbase, Kraken and Binance.US. Avoid apps from unknown websites or links in emails.Watch for pressure tactics: Scammers thrive on urgency; you only have two hours to pay; act now to claim your prize. Real financial institutions do not use this kind of pressure.Set up two-factor authentication (2FA): All crypto wallets and exchange accounts should have 2FA enabled. This adds a second layer of protection even if a password is stolen.Avoid public WiFi for crypto transactions: Never send crypto or log in to financial apps over public WiFi at coffee shops, airports or hotels. These networks are often unsecured and can be intercepted by hackers. Use your home WiFi or mobile data instead, and ensure your device has up-to-date antivirus protection.Talk to family before big transactions: Before sending large amounts of crypto or any money, have a quick conversation with someone you trust. Scammers often isolate victims and make them feel they must act alone. Encourage seniors to adopt a simple rule: If it’s more than $100, talk to someone first. A five-minute phone call could prevent a five-figure mistake.                  Think grandma got scammed? Here’s what to do immediately              If you’ve been scammed, act fast: Report it to the crypto exchange (they might freeze the funds), file a fraud report with the FTC or Chainabuse and contact elder support services for guidance and protection.1. Report the scam to the exchangeIf the funds were sent through Coinbase, Binance or another exchange, contact them right away. Some may be able to freeze accounts if action is taken quickly.2. File a report with law enforcement and the FTCCall your local police department.Report fraud to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.You can also report crypto fraud at Chainabuse.com, a trusted crypto crime reporting platform.3. Contact elder support resourcesElderCare Locator (USA): Connects older adults and families to local services, including Adult Protective Services for financial exploitation cases.Action Fraud (UK): The UK’s national fraud reporting center for scams, including those involving crypto.Scamwatch, ACCC (Australia): Provides scam alerts and allows reporting of cryptocurrency and financial scams affecting seniors.Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (Canada): A national agency for reporting and tracking fraud, including crypto scams targeting older adults.National Council on Aging – NCOA (US): Offers educational resources and scam prevention tools for seniors and caregivers.Age UK (UK): Provides advice and support for older people facing financial abuse, including online and crypto scams.Did you know? Hackers have been caught selling counterfeit smartphones infected with the Triada Trojan, malware that steals crypto and sensitive data by deeply embedding itself in the device’s system.                  Is crypto safe for seniors?              Yes, but only with proper education and safeguards. Cryptocurrency can be empowering, offering independence and investment opportunities. However, seniors can become easy targets without a strong awareness of the risks.Scammers increasingly target seniors through sophisticated tactics like fake investment platforms, romance scams and impersonation of government or tech support personnel. These schemes often involve urgent demands, emotional manipulation or unfamiliar technologies like crypto ATMs.To minimize risk, seniors should be educated on the basics of cryptocurrency, recognize common fraud tactics, use reputable platforms and involve trusted family or advisers before making transactions. Awareness and vigilance are essential to protect both assets and peace of mind in the digital age.As crypto continues to go mainstream, scammers are adapting fast. Don’t let your loved ones get rug-pulled or emotionally manipulated into losing everything. Share these tips. Stay involved.

2025-05-28T13:19:41.000Z,"NFT monthly sales break 2025 downward trend in May: CryptoSlam","Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) caught an uptick in monthly sales in May after months of consistent decline throughout 2025. Data from CryptoSlam shows that May’s NFT sales climbed to $430 million, up from $373 million in April, a 15% increase. It marks the first monthly sales increase since the start of the year, suggesting renewed interest in digital collectibles. This follows a five-month decline in sales since volume peaked at over $900 million in December 2024. May also had the highest number of transactions in 2025, reaching 5.5 million, according to CryptoSlam. The sales uptick could also be attributed to the divergence between unique NFT buyers and unique NFT sellers. NFT buyers continued to increase in May, while sellers declined. Chart compiled by Cointelegraph to demonstrate CryptoSlam data on NFT monthly sales. Source: CointelegraphNFT sellers dwindle, while buyers increaseMay also showed a significant jump in unique buyers. The number of users buying NFTs rose by 50% to over 936,000 in May, up from around 622,000 in April.May’s figures are the largest buyer count since October 2024, hinting at growing investor participation during the month. While buyers increased, the number of unique sellers continued to decline. In May, NFT sellers fell to around 284,600, the lowest amount recorded on the CryptoSlam platform since April 2021. The divergence between the growing buyer interest and shrinking seller activity could set the stage for more competitive bidding, which may lead to higher valuations. Chart compiled by Cointelegraph to demonstrate CryptoSlam data on NFT buyers and sellers. Source: Cointelegraph Related: Alchemy acquires no-code NFT launchpad HeyMint for undisclosed amountNFTs set for a comeback in 2025CryptoSlam strategist Yehudah Petscher said that the market is poised for a rebound, but with a more tempered outlook than its previous highs. “The NFT market will see a bounce back this year, probably just after BTC sees its top of the cycle,” Petscher told Cointelegraph, suggesting that the momentum in digital collectibles will follow broader crypto market trends. Despite the bullish sentiment, the strategist told Cointelegraph that the NFT comeback might not be similar to the space’s 2021 or 2021 peak. “Don’t expect a repeat of the 21/22 euphoria that we saw in NFTs,” Petscher said. Meanwhile, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a May 27 report that the sector needs new catalysts to fully rebound. The analyst believes real-world assets (RWAs) linking with NFTs could reignite the lending sector of digital collectibles. RWA NFTs also showed potential earlier this year.

These include AnchorZero, a platform helping crypto founders use Roth IRAs for tax advantages, and Spark Capital, a new venture focused on stablecoin infrastructure.Other portfolio companies include Ethena, ClearToken, Crossover Markets, Station70 and Theo — an onchain trading infrastructure project that recently raised $20 million from 17 different VC firms.The company plans to eventually back up to 30 companies with early-stage rounds ranging from $500,000 to $1 million.Metalayer was co-founded by Chainlink Labs’ former head of growth, Mickey Graham, and former Two Sigma executives Andy Kangpan and David Winton.Winton developed a proprietary data platform called Moirai to help Metalayer analyze developer activity, protocol engagement and blockchain transaction patterns to uncover promising projects. “Moirai is our internal sourcing engine for identifying early-stage crypto startups,” Graham told Cointelegraph in a written statement. “The platform is designed to help us systematically surface high-quality startups, and it evaluates opportunities across several key dimensions,” he said.Related: VC Roundup: 8-figure funding deals suggest crypto bull market far from overCrypto VC deals on the rise, but there’s a catchCrypto venture capital activity saw a notable uptick in the first quarter, with increases in both total funding and deal volume, according to data from Galaxy Digital. VC funding reached $4.9 billion during the quarter, though nearly half came from a single deal — Binance, which raised $2 billion from MGX, an investment firm backed by a United Arab Emirates sovereign wealth fund.Despite the outsized impact of the Binance deal, overall market activity showed signs of improving. A total of 446 crypto funding deals were recorded in Q1, marking a 7% increase from the previous quarter.Crypto VC deals remain considerably lower than the peak of the previous bull market. Source: GalaxyNevertheless, venture capital investors remain cautious about making fresh commitments to the sector, according to Robert Lee, a senior analyst at PitchBook. The first quarter was a challenging market environment as a sharp correction in crypto prices compounded investor reluctance.In an interview with Bloomberg last month, Lee noted that many venture capital firms are still on the sidelines. “[M]any of the funds from the last cycle have yet to deliver meaningful DPI,” he said, referring to the private equity metric Distributed to Paid-In Capital, which measures how much capital has been returned to investors relative to what they invested.Metalayer’s Mickey Graham believes that at least some of this drop-off is due to a much-needed transition happening beneath the surface:“We believe the crypto industry has crossed the chasm from an early market defined by infrastructure-building to a mainstream technology sector characterized by the deployment of blockchain technology throughout the global economy.”Although VC activity remains subdued compared to past bull cycles, Kadan Stadelmann, the chief technology officer of the Komodo Platform, told Cointelegraph that the industry has seen an “uptick in mergers and acquisitions, suggesting market maturation.”Stadelmann indicated that pro-crypto regulations in the United States and European Union, “have given large institutions confidence to continue making investments into crypto firms.”At a geographic level, the US accounted for more than a third of total crypto VC deals in 2024 — a trend expected to continue this year.

Could this technical setup, coupled with the SEC’s review of a spot XRP ETF application by WisdomTree, signal the start of a rally to $3.40 and higher?XRP falling wedge pattern targets $3.40From a technical perspective, XRP (XRP) price could gain significant momentum if it breaks out of this falling wedge pattern.In technical analysis, a falling wedge is a bullish reversal chart pattern that comprises two converging trend lines that connect lower highs and lower lows. This convergence indicates a weakening downward momentum. XRP price is currently retesting the resistance provided by the upper trendline of the wedge at $2.42. A break above this level will likely trigger a quick rise in price, with the bulls targeting the technical target of the wedge at $3.40, a 48% increase from current prices.XRP/USD daily chart.

In his widely cited 2022 paper, “The Ineluctable Modality of Securities Law: Why Fungible Crypto Assets Are Not Securities,” he wrote:“[T]here is no current basis in the law relating to ‘investment contracts’ to classify most fungible crypto assets as ‘securities’ when transferred in secondary transactions.”In his paper, Cohen explained that in secondary transactions, an investment contract transaction is generally not present. He further claimed that fungible cryptocurrencies “neither create nor represent the necessary cognizable legal relationship between” a legal entity and the holder that is the “hallmark of a security.”Related: Banking groups ask SEC to drop cybersecurity incident disclosure ruleSEC’s “new paradigm”Ripple also referenced SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce's May 19 “new paradigm” speech.

My supplemental answer is that economic realities matter and non-security crypto assets may be distributed as part of an investment contract, which is a type of security.”Ripple’s long fight with the SECThe SEC had viewed a large portion of digital assets as securities, with the regulator’s former chair, Gary Gensler, stating in 2023 that most of the crypto market falls under the securities bracket. This stance led to a protracted legal battle between the SEC and Ripple.The lawsuit first began at the end of 2020, when the SEC took action against Ripple and its executives, claiming that XRP sales constituted unregistered security offerings. Still, after the government’s stance on crypto changed with the election of current US President Donald Trump, Ripple has mostly won the battle, with the SEC recently dropping its appeal against a ruling favorable to the company.In its recent letter to the SEC, Ripple also cited a ruling in the case noting that “the court held that certain of Ripple’s historical institutional sales of XRP were investment contracts,” while the secondary sales were not.

2025-05-28T02:11:48.000Z,"Real-world assets could revitalize dying NFT lending market: DappRadar","Real-world assets linking up with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is one of a few key catalysts that could reignite the waning NFT lending sector, which is suffering from a collapse in volumes and user activity, says blockchain analytics platform DappRadar.Volumes in the NFT lending market, which allows NFT holders to take out a loan against their token, have dropped 97% from a peak of around $1 billion in January 2024 to $50 million in May, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a May 27 report.Gherghelas said for NFT lending to “move beyond survival mode,” it needs “new catalysts” to reignite the sector, such as real-world asset NFTs, like tokenized real estate or yield-bearing assets that could unlock more stable, trusted collateral sources.“So far, 2025 has not delivered a compelling reason for NFT lending to bounce back,” she said. “While the infrastructure is still here and the platforms remain active, activity has slowed across the board.” Borrower and leading activity have taken a big hit in the NFT lending sector. Source: DappRadar“For now, the sector seems to be in a holding pattern, waiting either for market recovery or a new use case to reignite interest.”Gherghelas added that other catalysts that could rekindle NFT lending were tools that make it easier for NFT holders to borrow against their tokens, and that protocols should create “smart infrastructure” such as undercollateralized loans, credit scores and artificial intelligence risk matching.The report adds that since January last year, borrower activity has declined by 90% and those willing to lend have shrunk by 78%.The average NFT loan size has also taken a hit from a peak of $22,000 in 2022 to $4,000 in May, a 71% year-over-year drop.Gherghelas said this shift “shows that either users are borrowing against lower-value assets or simply becoming more conservative with leverage.”NFT lending overall trading volume and market activity have dropped off from the all-time highs of past years. Source: DappRadarThe average loan duration is also lower; after hitting an average of roughly 40 days in 2023, it’s been down to 31 days and has held steady throughout 2024 and into 2025.Gherghelas said this could indicate that “loans are being taken more frequently but for shorter periods, perhaps a sign of more tactical liquidity plays.”NFT ﻿market downturn also hurts lendingPart of the slowdown in NFT lending is connected to the overall NFT market decline, which has seen volumes drop 61% in the first quarter to $1.5 billion compared to $4.1 billion a year ago.“With collateral value collapsing, the lending activity naturally followed,” Gherghelas said. “There are a few exceptions that managed to hold or regain traction, but they’ve been outliers, not enough to lift the sector.”Related: AI decentralized apps are coming for the Web3 throne: DappRadarThe protocol landscape has also narrowed, and the number of active NFT lending apps is limited, with only eight protocols holding any meaningful share.“The flip-for-liquidity model that worked during bull markets isn’t built for a quieter, more risk-averse environment. But that doesn’t mean NFT lending is finished; it’s simply shifting focus,” Gherghelas said.“Platforms are diversifying, use cases are shifting, and collateral preferences are changing. If the next wave builds on utility, culture, and better design, NFT lending might just find its second wind — one built to last.”Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-world-assets-revitalize-dying-nft-lending-dappradar?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

SharpLink will invest $425 million to acquire 120,000 ETH. Ethereum futures open interest hits an all-time high of $36.1 billion, with ETH price climbing 4.5% on the daily chart. Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming (SBET) announced a $425 million private investment in public equity (PIPE), acquiring approximately 69.1 million shares at $6.15 each to establish the first Nasdaq-listed Ethereum (ETH) treasury company.Spearheaded by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, this move mirrors Strategy’s (MSTR) successful Bitcoin treasury strategy, which has yielded over $8.2 billion in gains in 2025, by leveraging stock and bond sales to acquire BTC.Former Ethereum core developer and contributor Eric Conner highlighted the bullish implications of SharpLink’s move, noting its potential to create a “public ETH proxy for funds that can’t hold tokens directly.” Conner emphasized that the acquisition of 120,000 ETH—likely to be staked—could lead to “supply compression” by removing tokens from circulation. The Ether proponent also pointed to the “new narrative fuel” this provides, positioning ETH as a “digital reserve collateral” and potentially driving its adoption on mainstream balance sheets through an equity wrapper like $SBET.However, crypto analyst VICTOR cautioned against over-enthusiasm, outlining the risk of leveraging gains from an altcoin still down 19% in 2025. In Q1 2025, Cointelegraph reported a sharp decline in Ethereum network fees, dropping to $605,000 from $2.5 million in just two weeks in March, alongside a noticeable decrease in decentralized app (DApp) activity.

The majority of these rallies—eight out of ten—resulted in negative returns, while one rally triggered a short squeeze, driving prices higher, and another displayed neutral price action.From a technical perspective, Ether’s price action on the daily chart posted a descending triangle, a bullish breakout pattern, which creates equal highs and higher lows, converging toward an imminent rally. The pattern is bordered by two trendlines, the upper resistance, currently around $2,700 and the ascending support line. A bullish breakout above $2,677 targets the pattern’s measured move, calculated by adding the triangle’s height to the breakout point.

Speaking at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, Sigel said the most viable path forward may involve inserting Bitcoin mining incentives into the congressional budget reconciliation process.According to Sigel, the most effective path to growing a US strategic Bitcoin reserve would be through targeted amendments to congressional budget legislation. These could include tax credits for mining companies that use methane gas and other incentives aimed at encouraging miners to share a portion of their mined BTC with the federal government. He argued that such an approach would allow the reserve to grow organically over time. Sigel also highlighted the limitations of executive actions in achieving this goal:\""The problem with executive action is that it's going to prompt lawsuits. And anything over $100 million is going to get sued by the Elizabeth Warrens of the world. So, I would say start with something maybe in the Exchange Stabilization Fund for $100 million.\""US President Donald Trump established the US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve through a March 7 executive order.

FalconX, a digital asset broker, said it secured a facility worth over $100 million as part of a “broader credit framework,” while Maple Finance reportedly closed the first tranche of an agreement with Cantor.The service allows companies holding Bitcoin to borrow funds and use the cryptocurrency as collateral, providing a way to unlock liquidity without selling their BTC holdings.

At the time, the company said Anchorage Digital and Copper would serve as custodians and collateral managers in the venture.Credit markets are a fundamental part of the financial system, allowing capital to flow between borrowers and lenders and supporting economic activity across sectors.

The announcement indicates that the entire raise could go to Bitcoin purchases, which could make Strive the fifth-largest Bitcoin treasury company.The raise, completed through private investment, was priced at $1.35 per share of common stock. The funds were raised in partnership with Asset Entities, a marketing company that Strive plans to merge with.Strive announced its intentions to deploy a Bitcoin treasury strategy in early May, also revealing plans to go public through a reverse merger with social media marketing company Asset Entities.In a May 20 regulatory filing, the company shared plans to purchase 75,000 BTC from the bankrupt crypto exchange Mt.

Bitcoin’s bullish momentum aligns with the favorable US financial conditions, as noted by Ecoinometrics. The macroeconomic-focused Bitcoin newsletter highlighted that the National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) shows a rapid shift to ultra-loose territory after a tightening phase in February 2025. The NFCI, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, tracks stress in the financial system by aggregating measures like credit spreads, leverage, and funding conditions. When the index moves into looser territory, it reflects easier access to capital and reduced market stress—conditions that typically encourage risk-taking behavior among investors. For high-beta assets like Bitcoin, such periods often coincide with price rallies as capital flows into speculative markets.US National Financial Conditions Index. Source: EcoinometricsEcoinometrics mentioned that within four weeks, liquidity has returned, creating a supportive macroeconomic environment for risk assets like Bitcoin. The newsletter noted, “That’s the kind of macro backdrop where Bitcoin thrives. Bitcoin’s rally to new highs didn’t come out of nowhere. It’s tracking the same pattern we saw since 2023: easing conditions → capital rotation → risk-on.”With Bitcoin just 2% away from its all-time high price, data from CoinGlass indicates that the probability of a short-squeeze remains high due to significant sell-side liquidity. As illustrated below, if Bitcoin breaches $115,000, over $7 billion in short positions could get liquidated, triggering a cascading effect that pushes prices higher.Bitcoin liquidation map.

Two key onchain indicators—Supply in Profit Market Bands and the Advanced Net UTXO Supply Ratio—are flashing signals consistent with prior market tops.The Supply in Profit Market Bands metric tracks how much of the circulating BTC supply is currently in profit. As of late May 2025, this figure has surged to 19.4 million BTC, nearing historical extremes and entering the “Overheated Zone.” Previously, BTC prices tested this zone on Dec. 17, 2025, which was followed by a price correction to $93,000 from $107,000.

2025-05-27T15:40:00.000Z,"93% of all Bitcoin is already mined. Here’s what that means","How much Bitcoin is left to mine?              Bitcoin’s total supply is hardcoded at 21 million BTC, a fixed upper limit that cannot be altered without a consensus-breaking change to the protocol. This finite cap is enforced at the protocol level and is central to Bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset.As of May 2025, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoin (BTC) have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created, and those remaining coins will be mined very slowly.The reason for this uneven distribution is Bitcoin’s exponential issuance schedule, governed by an event called the halving. When Bitcoin launched in 2009, the block reward was 50 BTC. Every 210,000 blocks — or approximately every four years — that reward is cut in half. Because the early rewards were so large, over 87% of the total supply was mined by the end of 2020. Each subsequent halving sharply reduces the rate of new issuance, meaning it will take over a century to mine the remaining 6.7%.According to current estimates, 99% of all Bitcoin will have been mined by 2035, but the final fraction — the last satoshis — won’t be produced until around the year 2140 due to the nature of geometric reward reduction.This engineered scarcity, combined with an immutable supply cap, is what draws comparisons between Bitcoin and physical commodities like gold. But Bitcoin is even more predictable: Gold’s supply grows at around 1.7% annually, whereas Bitcoin’s issuance rate is transparently declining.Did you know? Bitcoin’s supply curve is not terminal in the traditional sense. It follows an asymptotic trajectory — a kind of economic Zeno’s paradox — where rewards diminish indefinitely but never truly reach zero. Mining will continue until around 2140, by which point over 99.999% of the total 21 million BTC will have been issued.                  Beyond the supply cap: How lost coins make Bitcoin scarcer than you think              While over 93% of Bitcoin’s total supply has been mined, that doesn’t mean it’s all available. A significant portion is permanently out of circulation, lost due to forgotten passwords, misplaced wallets, destroyed hard drives or early adopters who never touched their coins again.Estimates from firms like Chainalysis and Glassnode suggest that between 3.0 million and 3.8 million BTC — roughly 14%-18% of the total supply — is likely gone for good. That includes high-profile dormant addresses like the one believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, which alone holds over 1.1 million BTC.This means Bitcoin’s true circulating supply may be closer to 16 million-17 million, not 21 million. And because Bitcoin is non-recoverable by design, any lost coins stay lost — permanently reducing supply over time.Now compare that to gold. Around 85% of the world’s total gold supply has been mined — approximately 216,265 metric tons, according to the World Gold Council — but nearly all of it remains in circulation or held in vaults, jewelry, ETFs and central banks. Gold can be remelted and reused; Bitcoin cannot be resurrected once access is lost.This distinction gives Bitcoin a kind of hardening scarcity, a supply that not only stops growing over time but quietly shrinks.As Bitcoin matures, it’s entering a monetary phase similar to gold: low issuance, high holder concentration and increasing demand-side sensitivity. But Bitcoin takes it further; its supply cap is hard, its loss rate is permanent, and its distribution is publicly auditable.This may lead to several outcomes:Increased price volatility as available supply becomes more limited and sensitive to market demandHigher long-term value concentration in the hands of those who remain active and secure in their key managementA premium on liquidity, where actually spendable BTC trades at a higher effective value than dormant supply.In extreme cases, this could produce a bifurcation between “circulating BTC” and “unreachable BTC,” with the former gaining greater economic significance, particularly in times of constrained exchange liquidity or macroeconomic stress.                  What happens when Bitcoin is fully mined?              There’s a popular assumption that as Bitcoin’s block rewards shrink, the network’s security will eventually suffer. But in practice, the mining economy is far more adaptive — and much more resilient — than that.Bitcoin’s mining incentives are governed by a self-correcting feedback loop: If mining becomes unprofitable, miners drop off the network, which in turn triggers a difficulty adjustment. Every 2,016 blocks (roughly every two weeks), the network recalibrates mining difficulty using a parameter known as nBits. The goal is to keep block times steady at around 10 minutes, regardless of how many miners are competing.So, if Bitcoin’s price drops, or the reward becomes too small relative to operating costs, inefficient miners simply exit. This causes difficulty to fall, lowering the cost for those who remain. The result is a system that continually rebalances itself, aligning network participation with available incentives.This mechanism has already been tested at scale. After China banned mining in mid-2021, Bitcoin’s global hashrate dropped by more than 50% in a matter of weeks. Yet the network continued to function without interruption, and within a few months, the hashrate fully recovered, as miners resumed operations in jurisdictions with lower energy costs and more favorable regulations.Critically, the idea that lower rewards will inherently threaten network security overlooks how mining is tied to profit margins, not nominal BTC amounts. As long as the market price supports the cost of hash power — even at 0.78125 BTC per block (post-2028 halving) or lower — miners will continue to secure the network.In other words, it’s not the absolute reward that matters, but whether mining remains profitable relative to costs. And thanks to Bitcoin’s built-in difficulty adjustment, it usually does.Even a century from now, when the block reward approaches zero, the network will likely still be protected by whatever combination of fees, base incentives and infrastructure efficiency exists at that time. But that’s a distant concern. In the meantime, the current system — hashrate adjusts, difficulty rebalances, miners adapt — remains one of the most robust elements of Bitcoin’s design.Did you know? On April 20, 2024, following the launch of the Runes protocol, Bitcoin miners earned over $80 million in transaction fees within a single day, surpassing the $26 million earned from block rewards. This marked the first time in Bitcoin’s history that transaction fees alone exceeded the block subsidy in daily miner revenue.                  The future of Bitcoin mining: Energy consumption              It’s a common misconception that rising Bitcoin prices will drive endless energy use. In reality, mining is constrained by profitability, not price alone.As block rewards shrink, miners are pushed toward thinner margins, and that means chasing the cheapest, cleanest energy available. Since China’s 2021 mining ban, hashrate has migrated to regions like North America and Northern Europe, where operators tap into surplus hydro, wind and underutilized grid energy.According to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, between 52% and 59% of Bitcoin mining now runs on renewables or low-emission sources. Regulations are reinforcing this trend, with several jurisdictions offering incentives for clean-powered mining or penalizing fossil-fuel operations.Moreover, the idea that higher BTC prices will always mean higher energy use misses how Bitcoin self-regulates: More miners raise difficulty, which compresses margins, capping energy expansion. Renewable-based mining brings its own challenges, but the dystopian future of endlessly expanding fossil-fueled hash power is increasingly unlikely.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/93-of-all-bitcoin-is-already-mined-heres-what-that-means?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
