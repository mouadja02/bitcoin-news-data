2025-05-28T00:30:29.000Z,"James Wynn Suffers Staggering $14.3M Loss on Bitcoin Hyperliquid Position","BitcoinWorld James Wynn Suffers Staggering $14.3M Loss on Bitcoin Hyperliquid Position The world of cryptocurrency trading is known for its volatility and high stakes, but recent events surrounding prominent trader James Wynn have once again underscored the immense risks involved, particularly with high leverage. As the Bitcoin market experienced fluctuations, one notable figure faced significant financial setbacks, drawing attention from the crypto community. Who is James Wynn and What Happened to His Bitcoin Trading Position? James Wynn is recognized in the crypto space as a significant trader, often referred to as a “whale” due to the large size of his positions. Whales can significantly influence market dynamics, and their trading activity is closely watched by other participants. Recently, Wynn’s movements on the Hyperliquid platform became a focal point after he reportedly adjusted a substantial Bitcoin trading position. According to on-chain data shared by Lookonchain on X, James Wynn reduced his highly leveraged 40x Bitcoin long position. This action occurred as the price of BTC dropped below the $108,300 mark. Reducing a leveraged position, especially a long one during a price decline, typically involves closing part of the position at a loss to mitigate further downside risk or avoid liquidation. The Impact on Hyperliquid: A Closer Look The trade in question took place on Hyperliquid , a decentralized perpetual exchange known for offering high leverage options to traders. Platforms like Hyperliquid enable users to trade derivatives contracts that track the price of underlying assets like Bitcoin, allowing them to speculate on price movements without owning the actual asset. The appeal of Hyperliquid lies in its high leverage, which can amplify potential profits but equally magnify losses. James Wynn’s large position on Hyperliquid highlights the significant capital deployed by major traders on such platforms. While these platforms offer accessibility and high leverage, they also concentrate risk, making large trades and their outcomes particularly noteworthy for market observers. Understanding the Risks of 40x Leveraged Trading Leveraged trading is a powerful tool that allows traders to control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. Leverage is expressed as a ratio, such as 40:1 or simply 40x. In James Wynn’s case, 40x leverage means that for every dollar of his own capital used as margin, he was controlling $40 worth of Bitcoin. Here’s a breakdown of why 40x leverage is considered extremely high-risk: Amplified Gains and Losses: A small percentage move in the underlying asset (Bitcoin) is multiplied by the leverage factor. If Bitcoin moves up by just 1%, a 40x leveraged long position gains 40%. Conversely, if Bitcoin moves down by just 1%, the position loses 40%. Liquidation Risk: With 40x leverage, a price drop of only about 2.5% against the position’s direction can potentially wipe out the entire margin used for that position, leading to automatic liquidation by the platform to prevent the trader’s balance from going negative. Sensitivity to Volatility: Highly leveraged positions are extremely sensitive to even minor market fluctuations. In a volatile market like crypto, maintaining such a position requires constant monitoring and significant risk management. James Wynn’s decision to reduce his position as Bitcoin fell below $108,300 was likely a strategic move to avoid a complete liquidation, albeit at a substantial cost. How Crypto Whale Activity Impacts the Market The actions of a Crypto whale like James Wynn can have ripple effects. While a single whale’s trade might not single-handedly crash the market, their large positions and movements are closely watched indicators. Points to consider about whale activity: Market Sentiment: When a known whale takes a large position or, as in this case, significantly reduces one at a loss, it can influence market sentiment. Other traders might interpret this as a signal about the whale’s outlook on the market direction. Liquidity: Large trades, whether opening, closing, or reducing, require significant liquidity on the exchange. On decentralized platforms like Hyperliquid, these large orders can sometimes impact the order book and potentially influence short-term price action, though the platform is designed to handle large volumes. Transparency (on-chain): Thanks to on-chain analytics tools like Lookonchain, the movements of large wallets and known trading entities can be tracked, providing insights into potential market trends or risks. The Cost of High Stakes: $14.3M in Daily Losses The immediate consequence of James Wynn’s position reduction was a significant loss. According to Lookonchain, trimming his 40x leveraged Bitcoin long position resulted in an additional loss of approximately $4.75 million. This specific loss was incurred on the portion of the position that was closed. However, the total losses attributed to James Wynn from position reductions on that particular day were even higher, reaching approximately $14.3 million. This indicates that the reduction reported by Lookonchain might have been one of several adjustments made to his leveraged positions throughout the day as the market moved against him. These figures serve as a stark reminder of the potential financial downside in high-leverage trading. A $14.3 million loss in a single day is a substantial amount, even for a well-capitalized trader or entity. Actionable Insights for Traders While most retail traders do not operate with the capital or leverage levels of a Crypto whale like James Wynn, there are valuable lessons to be learned from this event: Understand Leverage: Before using leverage, fully grasp how it works and the risks involved. Higher leverage drastically increases liquidation risk. Risk Management is Crucial: Always use risk management tools like stop-loss orders to limit potential losses on leveraged positions. Do not over-leverage. Market Volatility: Recognize that the crypto market is highly volatile. Prices can move sharply and quickly, making highly leveraged positions particularly vulnerable. Whale Watching, Not Copying: While observing whale activity can be informative, blindly copying their trades is risky. Whales operate with different capital, strategies, and risk tolerance than retail traders. Choose Platforms Wisely: Understand the mechanics and risks associated with specific platforms like Hyperliquid, especially concerning their liquidation mechanisms and fees. James Wynn’s significant loss is a powerful example of the double-edged sword of high leverage. It highlights that even experienced traders with substantial capital are not immune to the risks inherent in volatile markets and aggressive trading strategies. Summary: A Cautionary Tale from the High-Leverage Arena The news of James Wynn facing a staggering $14.3 million in daily losses from reducing his 40x leveraged Bitcoin trading positions on Hyperliquid serves as a potent reminder of the potential pitfalls in the high-stakes world of crypto. This event underscores the extreme risks associated with high Leveraged trading , where even a slight unfavorable price movement can lead to massive losses or liquidation. As the market continues its volatile dance, the activities of a Crypto whale like Wynn offer valuable insights, not just into potential market shifts but, more importantly, into the critical need for robust risk management and a thorough understanding of the tools and platforms used. For both large and small traders, the principle remains the same: understand the risks before diving into the deep end of leveraged trading.

2025-05-28T00:22:56.000Z,"Justin Sun praises Trump for continued focus on cryptocurrency","Tron Founder Justin Sun hails Trump for ‘commitment’ to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. At the ongoing Bitcoin 2025 Conference, Sun expressed his admiration for President Donald Trump’s outspoken dedication to digital assets and blockchain. Sun said during a panel discussion that the game has certainly changed for digital assets in the US thanks to the influence of President Donald Trump. The conference, which is held in Las Vegas, has drawn major players in the crypto industry to the city, including lawmakers, entrepreneurs, and developers. Sun’s remarks were noteworthy in that he linked recent Bitcoin price spikes to policies backed by Trump and to expressions of public support. While speaking on a panel, Justin Sun claimed that Bitcoin would have never reached an all-new high of $100,000 without Trump. Bitcoin reached $100,000 in December 2024, a month after Trump’s election victory. The rally has continued, and the coin was trading recently above $109,000. Sun also mentioned being at a high-profile “crypto dinner” hosted by Trump a couple of days ago. He is the top holder of the TRUMP meme coin. In addition to his shares, Sun has also pumped $75 million into World Liberty Financial (WLFI), an entity allegedly very close to Trump’s digital asset plans. Trump buys Bitcoin as US creates satellites to store BTC in space In March 2025, President Trump passed an executive order for the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , a move solely intended to hedge Bitcoin as part of the US treasury. The reserve is financed directly by Bitcoin seized in criminal and civil investigations — not taxpayer funds. The hope is to treat Bitcoin like gold, a strategic store of value that the government holds long-term. Trump’s directive also established a new US Digital Asset Stockpile to oversee other cryptocurrencies. An executive order was also to review the government’s digital asset holdings. And though Senator Cynthia Lummis reported that the government owns something like 200,000 BTC, the entire report has yet to be released after a security review by the White House. The crypto-friendly wave on Capitol Hill keeps rolling. According to long-time Bitcoin advocate Senator Cynthia Lummis, the US Senate will consider the BITCOIN Act next week. The bill is intended to codify the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and permit the federal government to purchase as many as 1 million BTC over five years. The bill encourages broader acceptance of Bitcoin throughout federal infrastructure and payment systems. This aligns with Trump’s general crypto stance: to relax crypto laws, court blockchain investment, and protect minors’ rights. Lummis said it wasn’t just about Bitcoin and advancing America’s financial independence. The Senate is also considering a Stablecoin Bill , a legislation that would be the country’s first comprehensive crypto regulatory framework. Some analysts say such common-sense leadership has the potential to bring long-awaited legal clarity and financial confidence to US crypto markets through the BITCOIN Act and the Stablecoin Bill. The US Senate seems to be getting close to passing its landmark stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act — a battle its champion Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) said has been incredibly hard-fought. “It has been extremely difficult,” Lummis said during a fireside chat with Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas on Tuesday. “I had no idea how hard this was going to be.” Trump drives US Bitcoin strategy forward With Trump’s support and Congress already legislating, the US is quickly becoming the No. 1 place in the world for cryptocurrency innovation. Classic Chinese crypto players like Justin Sun are toasting the move — and doubling down on US crypto investments. The market likes what it sees. Bitcoin is in the $109,000 range today, and Ethereum is rising. Big exchanges and mining operations are moving on American turf, citing stable policy and rising institutional interest. One thing is apparent as the world looks on: under President Trump, Bitcoin will no longer be just a form of digital money — it will be the national strategy.

2025-05-28T00:00:23.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Bounces Off Re-Accumulation Zone: Why $120,000 Could Be Next","A new Bitcoin price analysis confirms that the flagship cryptocurrency is still in a bullish trend after its recent bounce off a key re-accumulation zone. With key structural support levels intact and a bullish AB=CD pattern unfolding, analysts are now eyeing a potential surge above $120,000, marking a new all-time high. Bitcoin Price Targets $122,000 After AB=CD Completion According to a technical analysis report by TradingView crypto analyst Weslad, Bitcoin is accurately following a well-defined bullish trajectory, potentially paving the way for a surge to $122,000. With BTC now priced at $109,747 at the time of writing, reaching this ATH target would represent an 11.17% increase from current levels. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Puts Bitcoin Price At $120,000 If This Range Breakout Happens This optimistic forecast comes on the heels of an accurate AB=CD pattern on the BTC chart—-a harmonic structure that previously hinted at significant upside potential. Notably, the Bitcoin price has since retraced into a key re-accumulation zone between $104,000 and $107,000 — a move the analyst described as a healthy correction rather than a reversal. Weslad has disclosed that the present re-accumulation zone is a price range where buyers are believed to be stepping in again. As long as Bitcoin stays within or above this zone, the analyst asserts that its market will remain bullish. Currently, Bitcoin is trading well-above the crucial psychological support of $100,000, reinforcing its bullish position. The broader market structure also remains intact within an Ascending Channel, supported by higher timeframe demand zones. According to Weslad’s analysis, if Bitcoin can firmly hold its price within the $104,000 – $107,000 range, the cryptocurrency could see a significant increase to the 2.618 Fibonacci Extension level near $122,000. Adding to this bullish case, a breakout above the $112,000 resistance is also needed to confirm the next leg of this move, marking a potentially stronger and larger upside momentum. BTC Set For Major Pullback Before Breakout As the Bitcoin price approaches the local resistance around $111,000, Weslad warns that the market may face a temporary hurdle before the continuation of the projected uptrend. The TradingView analyst notes that if price action is rejected at this resistance level, traders should anticipate a potential re-test of the $107,000 – $108,000 region. Related Reading: Bitcoin Top Indicator Says It’s Not Over Yet As Parabola Signals Fail This area has served as a reliable barrier during the recent consolidation phase and is expected to hold firm in the event of a minor correction. Most recently, Weslad affirmed that this anticipated corrective move has already concluded, signaling that the market is now poised for the “real growth phase.” With the base demand zone around $86,000 – $91,000 and strong support around $96,000 – $99,000, Bitcoin’s overall structure remains bullish unless a decisive breakdown below $100,000 occurs. Until then, all eyes remain on the $112,000 breakout level, which could trigger a potential surge toward the projected $122,000 target.

2025-05-27T23:50:45.000Z,"Square starts live Bitcoin payments at a live event","Square, a Block company, has launched real-time Bitcoin payments at a live pop-up store during Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas. This allows customers to scan and spend crypto on-site, a key milestone in its plan to make BTC everyday money. The initiative reflects Block’s belief that Bitcoin can become the internet’s native currency , giving small businesses more payment options and control. Square starts live Bitcoin payments at a live event Square launched its new real-time Bitcoin payment system that was set up inside BTC Inc.’s pop-up merchandise truck during the Bitcoin 2025 conference at The Venetian in Las Vegas. The system is faster, cheaper, and more scalable than regular on-chain payments because it uses the Lightning Network, a special technology that processes transactions off the main blockchain. Users don’t need to understand how crypto works to make a payment as they’ll scan a QR code at checkout and let Square handle the real-time conversion rates, payment confirmation, and converting bitcoin into US dollars. Block’s Bitcoin product team lead, Miles Suter, joined in 2017 and is now helping connect Bitcoin across multiple Block products. This includes Spiral, Cash App, Bitkey, and Square, after years of experience building crypto tools. The Las Vegas event was a live test to see how real-time BTC payments could work in retail. Block plans to make the feature globally available by 2026 with regulatory approval from the target areas. Block builds full toolkit to help small businesses use Bitcoin Block wants to make Bitcoin the native currency of the internet and is building a complete set of tools to help small and medium-sized businesses accept, manage, and benefit from using Bitcoin in everyday operations. The company has doubled down on Bitcoin as its core bet on the future of money, while other fintech firms invest in stablecoins and tokenized dollars. Over 1,000 sellers have adopted the company’s Bitcoin Conversion tool, automatically changing a portion of their daily sales into BTC. The company claims that the merchants’ Bitcoin holdings grew by around 70% over the past year. Block’s new real-time Bitcoin checkout feature also allows merchants to receive payment in BTC and instantly convert it to US dollars without any price volatility or risk. Block is also building its “Bitcoin for Business” toolkit to help small businesses accept payments in BTC through a standard transaction or a quick QR code scan and instantly convert between US dollars and Bitcoin. Sellers who want to hold their Bitcoin can withdraw it to Block’s secure self-custody wallet, Bitkey, without using third-party exchange platforms. Block’s Bitcoin ecosystem connects Cash App for trading, Bitkey for wallet and custody, Spiral for open-source development, and Proto for mining infrastructure to build a full-stack Bitcoin platform that works for both consumers and merchants. Bitcoin prices are at an all-time high, while many companies still treat it as a store of value. Block believes they can increase Bitcoin adoption rates by showing real utility. Block also hopes to level the playing field and push Bitcoin into the mainstream economy, one sale at a time, by giving small businesses the same tools that big companies use.

2025-05-27T23:49:04.000Z,"BNB Price Analysis and Short-term Forecast","The post BNB Price Analysis and Short-term Forecast appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The rise of Ethereum (ETH) price above $2.6k in the past 24 hours played a crucial role in the bullish recovery for the Binance (BNB) coin. According to crypto data from Coingecko, BNB price gained over 2 percent in the past 24 hours to trade about $687 on Tuesday, during the late North American trading session, As a result, BNB regained a market cap of over $100 billion, with a 24-hour average trading volume of about $1 billion. The notable surge in crypto FOMO significantly helped BNB price to regain bullish sentiment amid the highly anticipated altseason. BNB Rises on Favorable Fundamentals The rise and adoption of the BNB chain by mainstream users has heavily bolstered the success of its decentralized financial products. For instance, the PancakeSwap (CAKE ) has continued to record historical daily volume following the notable mainstream adoption of the ecosystem’s tokens and memecoins. According to market data from Defillama, the BSC network had a total value locked of about $6.5 billion and a stablecoins market cap of around $10.1 billion. Most importantly, the BSC chain recorded a daily average active users of about 2 million. Short Term Targets BNB price has gradually followed Bitcoin (BTC) price action in the past two months. In the past three weeks, BNB price has consolidated in a symmetrical ascending triangular pattern, with a crucial resistance level around $687. As a result, it is safe to assume that the BNB bulls have been gaining more ground over the sellers in the past. With Bitcoin price on the cusp of a major rally, catalyzed by heightened demand from institutional investors , BNB price is well positioned to rally beyond $687. Moreover, the four-hour MACD line remains above the zero line amid the growing bullish histograms. As the four-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) works on piercing the 70 percent level, BNB price is aiming at rallying above $790 soon.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bnb-price-analysis-and-short-term-forecast/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BNB","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare
2025-05-27T23:45:34.000Z,"TRX’s Correlation to BTC Could Result in 4x Surge in 2025: Analyst","Tron (TRX) may be poised for an explosive breakout, with market analysts now pointing to its correlation with Bitcoin (BTC) as a major catalyst. According to on-chain researcher Carmelo Alemán, TRX could “multiply significantly in value,” potentially even quadrupling, if BTC continues its bull run through the rest of the year. A Catalyst for Altcoin Growth Bitcoin, down 0.5% in 24 hours to trade at $109,500 at this writing, remains the gravitational force in crypto markets. As Alemán noted in a May 27 quick take on CryptoQuant, tokens with a high association to BTC, usually measured using the Pearson coefficient, tend to amplify gains during bull cycles. “A strong correlation with Bitcoin means that tokens sharing this dynamic could experience significantly assured growth,” the analyst wrote. They highlighted cryptocurrencies like TRX, Sui (SUI), Cardano (ADA), Hedera (HBAR), and Litecoin (LTC) for their historical synchronicity with BTC’s movements. According to them, while Bitcoin’s $2.17 trillion market cap limits its upside, TRX’s $26 billion valuation offers more explosive potential. “Bitcoin is unlikely to grow more than 2x from its current price,” argued the researcher. “Highly correlated tokens could triple, quadruple, or more, simply because their smaller market caps make such expansions more feasible.” The king cryptocurrency’s current rally has created fertile ground for connected altcoins. Although it has cooled slightly from its May 22 all-time high (ATH) of $111,814, it has risen 16.4% over the past month. Still, its seven-day performance shows a more modest 3.7% uptick. Nonetheless, the broader trajectory remains bullish, with BTC up 60% across the last 12 months, riding on the back of institutional demand and exchange-traded fund (ETF) flows. Against this backdrop, TRX has edged out its more established counterpart across multiple timeframes. Since yesterday, the token has risen 1.9%, while over the last 30 days it has gained more than 10.4%. However, across the year, TRX has really shone, with its 146.4% improvement more than doubling BTC’s gains in the same period. The upward trend has brought the altcoin to $0.2768, just 35% below its ATH of $0.4313, reached in December last year. TRX’s Resilience and Risk Metrics Signal Strength It’s not the BTC tie-in alone that’s driving bullish sentiment. Tron has seen rapid network growth and increased adoption across Asia. Additionally, in a historic shift, the supply of Tether (USDT) on the network surpassed that on Ethereum, signaling rising utility and trust. CryptoQuant’s recent drawdown heatmaps and risk metrics back this up, showing that TRX maintains one of the most resilient positions in the market, even as other altcoins stumble. The token’s 180-day Sharpe Ratio stands between 0.1 and 0.15, while its Normalized Risk Metric hovers near 0.5, indicating a strong risk-return profile. Mid this month, data from the on-chain analytics platform also revealed that all TRX holders, from one-week traders to long-term investors, were in profit . This rare alignment often triggers a positive feedback loop, as lucrative users tend to evangelize the asset, attracting new entrants.

2025-05-27T23:30:56.000Z,"US Stock Markets Open Higher: Igniting Hope for Crypto Investors","BitcoinWorld US Stock Markets Open Higher: Igniting Hope for Crypto Investors Today brings encouraging news from the traditional financial world, as US stock markets open higher . While our primary focus is on the dynamic realm of cryptocurrency, understanding movements in traditional markets, particularly the stock market open , is crucial. This is because there’s often a significant crypto market impact tied to shifts in broader investor confidence and capital flows. Let’s dive into what this means and why it matters to you. Decoding the Positive US Stock Markets Open The trading day commenced with a notable uptick across major indices, signaling a positive sentiment among investors. This higher open didn’t happen in a vacuum; it’s typically influenced by a confluence of factors, ranging from economic data releases and corporate earnings reports to geopolitical developments and overall market psychology. When US stock markets start the day strong, it can suggest increased risk appetite, which sometimes spills over into more volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Breaking Down the Numbers: S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow The positive momentum is clearly reflected in the performance of the key benchmarks shortly after the open: S&P 500: Gained 0.88% NASDAQ Composite: Saw a significant rise of 1.37% Dow Jones Industrial Average: Increased by 0.59% These numbers indicate broad-based strength, with technology and growth stocks, heavily represented in the NASDAQ, showing particular vigor. The S&P 500 , often seen as a barometer for the broader market, also posted solid gains. This collective upward movement paints a picture of optimism pervading the traditional financial sector. The Crypto Market Impact: Understanding the Correlation Now, let’s connect the dots. The relationship between traditional markets and crypto is complex and evolving. At times, Bitcoin and altcoins have acted as uncorrelated assets, moving independently. However, in recent years, particularly with increased institutional involvement, we’ve seen periods of strong correlation. A positive stock market open , especially one driven by factors like easing inflation fears or strong economic outlooks, can foster a risk-on environment. In such an environment, investors may be more inclined to allocate capital to assets perceived as higher risk, including cryptocurrencies. This potential crypto market impact is why monitoring traditional indices is valuable for crypto enthusiasts. What This Investor Sentiment Shift Could Mean A higher open across major indices like the S&P 500 often reflects improving investor sentiment . When confidence is high, market participants are more willing to invest, leading to increased buying pressure. This positive mood can be contagious, potentially influencing sentiment in adjacent markets like crypto. While crypto markets have their own unique drivers (regulatory news, technological developments, specific project updates), positive macroeconomic tailwinds and robust investor sentiment in traditional finance can provide a supportive backdrop. Benefits of Positive Stock Market Sentiment for Crypto: Potential for increased capital inflow into crypto. Improved overall market confidence. Reduced panic selling driven by macroeconomic fears. Challenges and Nuances: Correlation isn’t guaranteed; crypto can decouple. Specific crypto news can outweigh traditional market influence. Volatility remains inherent in the crypto space regardless of stock market performance. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the positive US stock markets open and the potential for a positive crypto market impact , what should crypto investors consider? Observe Correlation: Pay attention to whether crypto assets are tracking traditional markets or showing independent movement. Assess Risk Appetite: A rising stock market often signals higher risk appetite. Consider if this aligns with your own investment strategy. Stay Informed: While stock market news is relevant, remember that crypto markets have their own ecosystem of news and developments that are equally, if not more, important. Diversify Wisely: A strong traditional market doesn’t eliminate crypto volatility. Maintain a diversified portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance. The current stock market open provides a snapshot of the broader financial mood. While it’s a positive sign, it’s just one piece of the puzzle when navigating the crypto landscape. Summary In conclusion, US stock markets saw a strong open today, with the S&P 500 , NASDAQ, and Dow all posting gains. This positive start reflects improved investor sentiment in traditional finance. While the connection isn’t always direct, a robust stock market open can potentially have a positive crypto market impact by fostering a risk-on environment. Crypto investors should monitor these trends as part of a broader strategy, keeping in mind the unique drivers and inherent volatility of the digital asset space.

2025-05-27T23:20:01.000Z,"Strive Secures Massive $750M PIPE Round for Bitcoin Claims & Crypto Acquisition","BitcoinWorld Strive Secures Massive $750M PIPE Round for Bitcoin Claims & Crypto Acquisition Big news shaking up the digital asset space! Strive, a name increasingly associated with strategic investments, has just closed a substantial Strive PIPE round , pulling in a remarkable $750 million. This isn’t just another funding announcement; it signals an aggressive move into specific, often overlooked, corners of the market, particularly those involving Bitcoin claims and broader crypto acquisition strategies. Let’s dive into what this means and why it’s a noteworthy development for anyone following the intersection of traditional finance and digital assets. Unpacking the $750M Strive PIPE Round So, what exactly happened? Strive successfully completed a Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE) round. This is a way for a publicly traded company (or one planning to go public soon) to raise capital by selling stock directly to a select group of accredited investors, often at a discount to the current market price. In this case, Strive raised an initial $750 million by selling shares at $1.35 each. But wait, there’s more. The deal includes an option to increase the total funding by another $750 million upon the exercise of warrants. This means the potential total capital infusion could reach a staggering $1.5 billion, providing Strive with significant firepower for its stated objectives. Why use a PIPE? For companies, it can be a faster way to raise large sums of capital compared to traditional public offerings. For investors, it offers a chance to buy shares at a potentially favorable price, especially if they believe in the company’s long-term strategy. This particular Strive PIPE round is one of the larger ones seen recently, especially within the context of digital asset-related ventures, highlighting the growing institutional appetite for exposure to this sector, albeit through structured deals. Where is This Massive Digital Asset Investment Headed? According to reports, the primary purpose of this significant capital raise is to fuel Strive’s acquisition strategy. This isn’t a simple buy-and-hold Bitcoin play. Strive is targeting a diverse range of assets, indicating a complex, multi-pronged approach: Biotech Firms: This might seem surprising in a crypto context, but it suggests Strive is building a diversified portfolio, potentially leveraging insights or capital from one sector to support another. It highlights that Strive’s ambitions extend beyond just digital assets. Distressed Bitcoin Claims: This is where things get particularly interesting for the crypto community. Strive is specifically looking to acquire claims related to situations where Bitcoin or other digital assets are tied up, often due to exchange failures, hacks, or legal disputes. Discounted Structured Bitcoin Credit Instruments: This refers to complex financial products where Bitcoin is involved, often as collateral or part of a lending/borrowing arrangement, that are currently trading below their intrinsic value. This strategy suggests Strive is looking for value in non-traditional places, leveraging potential discounts available in complex or distressed situations rather than just buying liquid assets on the open market. Focusing on Distressed Bitcoin Claims: The Mt. Gox Angle The mention of Mt Gox claims is particularly noteworthy. Mt. Gox was once the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange, which famously collapsed in 2014 after a massive hack. Years later, rehabilitation efforts are still ongoing to return a portion of the lost Bitcoin to creditors. These claims have been traded privately for years, often at significant discounts to the market value of the underlying Bitcoin, due to the uncertainty and long timeline involved in the recovery process. Strive’s interest in Bitcoin claims like those from Mt. Gox signals a belief that the potential upside from resolving these claims outweighs the risks and complexities. Buying distressed claims requires specialized legal and financial expertise to navigate the recovery process and potentially profit from the difference between the purchase price and the eventual payout. This isn’t limited to Mt. Gox. There are other instances of exchanges or platforms where customer assets have been frozen or lost, creating opportunities to acquire these distressed claims at a discount. Strive appears to be positioning itself as a major player in this niche, aiming to capitalize on the eventual release of these locked-up digital assets. The Broader Impact of This Crypto Acquisition Strategy What does Strive’s aggressive crypto acquisition plan mean for the wider market? Firstly, it validates the idea that there is significant value locked up in distressed digital asset situations. A $750M-$1.5B war chest dedicated partly to acquiring these assets could accelerate the process of getting some of this capital back into circulation, potentially impacting market liquidity and sentiment. Secondly, it highlights the increasing sophistication of institutional players entering the digital asset space. Strive isn’t just buying Bitcoin; they are engaging in complex financial engineering and distressed asset recovery, strategies common in traditional finance but relatively new on a large scale in crypto. Thirdly, the focus on discounted structured credit instruments involving Bitcoin shows a growing interest in the more complex layers of the digital asset ecosystem beyond just spot trading. This suggests maturation in the market, with players seeking opportunities in derivatives, lending, and structured products. Potential Benefits and Opportunities Strive’s strategy could unlock several benefits: For Strive: Potential for significant returns by acquiring assets below market value and successfully navigating recovery processes. Diversification across biotech and digital assets. For Claim Holders: Provides liquidity options for those holding distressed Bitcoin claims who prefer cash now over waiting years for an uncertain payout. For the Market: Could help clear up legacy issues like Mt. Gox, potentially returning significant amounts of Bitcoin to circulation. Signals strong institutional confidence in the long-term value of digital assets, even those tied up in complex situations. Challenges and Risks Ahead However, this strategy is not without its hurdles: Execution Risk: Successfully acquiring and recovering value from distressed assets is complex and requires specialized expertise and legal work. Market Volatility: The value of the underlying Bitcoin or other digital assets can fluctuate wildly, impacting the profitability of claims and credit instruments. Legal and Regulatory Uncertainty: Navigating the legal frameworks around distressed assets and digital currencies in different jurisdictions can be challenging. Competition: Strive isn’t the only entity interested in distressed Mt Gox claims or other similar opportunities. Competition could drive up acquisition costs. Actionable Insights from This Digital Asset Investment What can readers take away from this? Firstly, pay attention to the distressed asset space within crypto. While complex, it can offer insights into where sophisticated investors see deep value. Secondly, understand that institutional involvement in crypto is becoming increasingly nuanced, moving beyond simple spot purchases into more complex financial strategies like those employed in this significant digital asset investment by Strive. Finally, watch how Strive executes its strategy; its success or challenges could pave the way for others looking at similar opportunities. Conclusion: A Bold Move in Digital Asset Acquisition Strive’s successful $750 million PIPE round, with the potential to double, is a major development. It provides the company with substantial capital to pursue an ambitious acquisition strategy targeting biotech, but crucially for our focus, distressed Bitcoin claims like those from Mt. Gox, and complex structured credit instruments. This move highlights the growing institutional confidence in digital assets, even in their more complicated forms, and signals a sophisticated approach to value creation in the space. While challenges remain, Strive’s significant funding positions it as a key player to watch in the evolving landscape of crypto acquisition and distressed asset recovery.

2025-05-27T23:18:10.000Z,"Sen. Lummis on Push for Stablecoin Bill: ‘I Had No Idea How Hard This Was Going to Be’","LAS VEGAS, Nevada — The U.S. Senate seems to be getting close to passing its landmark stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act — a battle its champion Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) said has been incredibly hard-fought. “It has been extremely difficult,” Lummis said during a fireside chat with Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas on Tuesday. “I had no idea how hard this was going to be.” Last week, the Senate voted to advance the bill, easily clearing the 60-vote threshold required to kick the bill to its last discussion phase before the final vote to pass it out of the body entirely. An earlier attempt failed on a bipartisan basis after Senate Democrats, led by long-time crypto sceptic Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), as well as several Republicans including Missouri’s Josh Hawley and Kentucky’s Rand Paul, voted against cloture. Lummis, whose staff (along with that of the bill’s co-sponsor, Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York)) has played a key role in the behind-the-scenes negotiations to get the GENIUS Act passed, said that she thinks the Senate has reached a final deal. If the bill passes, both Lummis and Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), the bill's sponsor, claimed that it would be the first piece of legislation passed out of the Senate Banking Committee in eight years. “It’s taken a tremendous amount of work,” Hagerty said, speaking on a separate panel discussion on Tuesday. Hagerty added that long-time crypto skeptic Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), the bill’s main opponent, made a concerted effort to drag out the proceedings in the hopes of stalling the legislation’s progress. Hagerty said that the bill, once passed, would be the most bipartisan piece of legislation to pass through the Senate Banking Committee in over a decade. While the bill’s supporters see that as a win, they’re also frustrated with the difficulty in getting legislation in general passed through the committee. “We don’t have the muscle memory anymore to legislate. That’s our job,” Lummis said. “It really is very frustrating, very exhausting, and you have to keep your creativity, your sense of humor and your patience about you.” Lummis added that she was “very hopeful” the Senate could work behind-the-scenes with the House on a market structure bill, noting that the House has the advantage of “muscle memory” (following its passage of FIT21 last year) over the Senate when it comes to the next hurdle of crypto legislation.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/05/27/sen-lummis-on-push-for-stablecoin-bill-i-had-no-idea-how-hard-this-was-going-to-be,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION","Policy|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-27T23:15:04.000Z,"Trump Media Secures Massive $2.5B for Bitcoin Treasury","BitcoinWorld Trump Media Secures Massive $2.5B for Bitcoin Treasury Big news is shaking up both the financial and crypto worlds! Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the parent company behind Truth Social, is reportedly making a massive move into the cryptocurrency space. This isn’t just a small pilot program; the company has announced plans to raise a significant amount of capital specifically to build a substantial Bitcoin Treasury . Trump Media’s Ambitious Bitcoin Treasury Plan Takes Shape According to recent reports, Trump Media has entered into agreements with approximately 50 institutional investors. The goal? To raise a staggering $2.5 billion. This capital infusion is structured in two parts: $1.5 billion will come from common stock offerings, and an additional $1 billion will be raised through convertible notes. This significant fundraising effort underscores the company’s serious intent. The primary stated purpose for deploying these funds is to establish a corporate Bitcoin Treasury . This means the company intends to convert a portion of the raised capital into Bitcoin, holding it on its balance sheet as a reserve asset. If executed as planned, this would position Trump Media as one of the largest public companies globally by the sheer size of its potential BTC Holdings . Key details emerging about this planned offering include: Total Raise Amount: $2.5 billion Funding Structure: $1.5B via common stock, $1B via convertible notes Number of Investors: Around 50 institutional investors Primary Use of Funds: Establishing a Bitcoin Treasury Expected Closing Date: By May 29 Custody Providers: Crypto.com Exchange and Anchorage Digital This strategic decision highlights a growing trend among corporations looking to diversify their treasury assets beyond traditional fiat currencies and low-yielding instruments. Why Corporate Bitcoin? Understanding the Treasury Trend The concept of a Corporate Bitcoin treasury gained significant traction during periods of economic uncertainty and rising inflation concerns. Companies like MicroStrategy pioneered the strategy, arguing that holding Bitcoin offers a potential hedge against currency devaluation and serves as a superior store of value compared to cash reserves. Several factors motivate companies to consider adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply is seen by many as protection against the devaluation of fiat currencies through inflation. Potential Appreciation: Companies anticipate that the value of Bitcoin will increase over time, potentially boosting shareholder value. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset can help diversify financial risk. Signaling Innovation: Holding Bitcoin can signal a company’s forward-thinking approach and embrace of new technologies. While the primary drivers often relate to macroeconomic concerns and potential financial upside, the decision also involves embracing a relatively new and volatile asset class. Institutional Bitcoin Adoption: Who Else is Entering the Space? Trump Media’s move is part of a broader wave of Institutional Bitcoin adoption. Over the past few years, we’ve seen increasing interest and investment from hedge funds, asset managers, and even other public corporations. Some notable public companies that have allocated significant capital to BTC Holdings include: Company Primary Business Reported BTC Holdings (Approx.) Notes MicroStrategy Business Intelligence Software ~214,400 BTC Pioneer in the corporate treasury strategy, continues to accumulate. Tesla Electric Vehicles & Clean Energy ~9,720 BTC Purchased early, sold a portion, currently holds a significant amount. Block, Inc. (formerly Square) Financial Services & Mobile Payments ~8,030 BTC fintech company, strong advocate for Bitcoin. Marathon Digital Holdings Bitcoin Mining ~18,000 BTC Bitcoin miner holding a substantial portion of mined coins. Note: These figures are approximate and subject to change based on company disclosures and market activity. The involvement of approximately 50 institutional investors in Trump Media’s fundraising round further underscores the growing appetite among traditional financial players for exposure to the digital asset space, even if indirectly through a public company’s balance sheet. Estimating Trump Media’s Potential BTC Holdings If Trump Media were to allocate a substantial portion of the $2.5 billion raise towards purchasing Bitcoin, its potential BTC Holdings could be significant. For context, MicroStrategy’s current holdings are valued in the billions of dollars. A $2.5 billion allocation, depending on the prevailing Bitcoin price at the time of purchase, could place Trump Media among the top corporate holders globally. For example, if Bitcoin were trading around $60,000 per coin, a $1 billion allocation could potentially acquire over 16,000 BTC. A $2 billion allocation could acquire over 33,000 BTC. These numbers would immediately position Trump Media’s treasury alongside or even exceeding some of the existing large corporate holders, excluding dedicated Bitcoin mining or investment firms. The exact amount allocated to Bitcoin will depend on the company’s treasury management strategy and other potential uses for the raised capital. However, the stated intent to establish a “Bitcoin treasury” suggests a meaningful allocation is planned. Navigating the Waters: Benefits and Challenges of a Bitcoin Treasury While the potential upsides of holding Bitcoin are attractive, establishing a Bitcoin Treasury also comes with unique challenges and risks that companies must carefully consider. Potential Benefits: Capital Appreciation: The primary allure is the potential for Bitcoin’s value to increase significantly over time, boosting the company’s balance sheet value. Macroeconomic Hedge: Protection against inflation and currency debasement, particularly relevant in the current global economic climate. Enhanced Profile: Can attract investors interested in technology and digital assets, potentially broadening the company’s shareholder base. Significant Challenges and Risks: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for dramatic price swings, which can introduce significant volatility to the company’s balance sheet and earnings reports. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, posing potential compliance and legal risks. Security and Custody: Securely storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires specialized expertise and infrastructure to prevent theft or loss. Relying on reputable custodians like Crypto.com Exchange and Anchorage Digital is crucial. Accounting Treatment: Accounting rules for cryptocurrencies can be complex and vary by jurisdiction, potentially impacting how holdings are reported and taxed. Public and Shareholder Scrutiny: The decision to hold a volatile asset like Bitcoin may face criticism from some shareholders or the public. Companies adopting this strategy must implement robust risk management frameworks and ensure transparent communication with their investors. What’s Next for Trump Media and Corporate Crypto? The expected closing of the $2.5 billion offering by May 29 is a key date to watch. Following the successful raise, the focus will shift to how and when Trump Media begins accumulating Bitcoin for its treasury. The market reaction to this news, both for TMKG shares and the Bitcoin price itself, will also be closely monitored. This move by a high-profile, publicly traded company could potentially encourage other corporations, perhaps those previously hesitant, to explore adding digital assets to their balance sheets. It further validates the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class within traditional finance, driven by growing Institutional Bitcoin interest. The role of the chosen custodians, Crypto.com Exchange and Anchorage Digital, is also noteworthy. These platforms provide the secure infrastructure necessary for managing large-scale BTC Holdings , a critical component for any corporate treasury strategy involving digital assets. Ultimately, Trump Media’s plan to establish a large Bitcoin Treasury through this significant fundraising effort marks a notable development in the intersection of traditional finance, public companies, and the evolving world of cryptocurrency. It’s a story that will continue to unfold, offering insights into the future of corporate finance and the increasing mainstream adoption of Bitcoin.

2025-05-27T23:00:11.000Z,"MARA Holdings: Spectacular Bitcoin Mining Revenue Record Set","BitcoinWorld MARA Holdings: Spectacular Bitcoin Mining Revenue Record Set Get ready for some truly spectacular news from the world of digital asset mining! MARA Holdings, the company formerly known as Marathon Digital, has just achieved a significant milestone that underscores the profitability potential within the current market cycle. They’ve reached a new all-time high in Bitcoin mining revenue, signaling strong operational performance and strategic positioning. Unpacking the Record-Breaking Bitcoin Mining Revenue According to data from CryptoQuant, as cited by Cointelegraph, MARA Holdings surpassed an annualized Bitcoin mining revenue figure of $752 million on May 27th. This wasn’t just a good day; it represented a peak achievement for the company in terms of the revenue generated from its core operation: mining Bitcoin. Reaching such a high annualized rate indicates a powerful combination of factors working in their favor at that specific time, including potentially favorable Bitcoin prices and efficient mining operations. Let’s break down what this figure means: Annualized Rate: This figure projects the daily or short-term revenue over a full year, assuming conditions remained constant. While market conditions fluctuate constantly, hitting this rate even momentarily highlights the significant earning capacity MARA Holdings achieved. New All-Time High: This record surpasses any previous revenue peak for the company, reflecting growth in their mining capacity, efficiency, or capitalizing on market conditions better than ever before. Significance: For a Bitcoin miner, revenue is the lifeblood. A record high revenue figure is a strong indicator of operational success and the ability to generate significant income from the challenging process of discovering new Bitcoin blocks. Beyond Mining: The Scale of MARA Holdings’ Bitcoin Holdings While setting a record for Bitcoin mining revenue is impressive, MARA Holdings also sits on a substantial treasure trove of the digital asset itself. The company’s balance sheet reflects significant Corporate Bitcoin holdings. As of the data cited, MARA held a staggering 48,237 BTC. At the valuation provided, this stash was worth over $5.28 billion. This positions MARA Holdings as a major player not just in mining, but also as one of the largest public companies holding Bitcoin directly on their balance sheet. In fact, with over 48,000 BTC, they are recognized as the second-largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally, trailing only behind MicroStrategy (MSTR), which is well-known for its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Holding such a significant amount of Bitcoin provides MARA Holdings with several strategic advantages: Asset Appreciation: As the price of Bitcoin increases, the value of their holdings grows substantially, adding considerable strength to their balance sheet. Flexibility: The held Bitcoin can potentially be used for various purposes in the future, though the company’s primary strategy has been to accumulate. Investor Appeal: For investors bullish on Bitcoin, holding shares in a company that both mines and holds a large amount of BTC can be an attractive proposition. Understanding the Role of a Bitcoin Miner To fully appreciate MARA’s achievement, it helps to understand what a Bitcoin miner actually does. A Bitcoin miner is essentially a participant in the Bitcoin network who uses powerful computers (mining rigs) to solve complex computational problems. The first miner to solve the problem for a new block gets to add that block of transactions to the blockchain and is rewarded with newly minted Bitcoin (the block reward) and transaction fees from the transactions included in the block. Key factors influencing a Bitcoin miner’s revenue and profitability include: Bitcoin Price: The market value of the Bitcoin received as rewards is the most significant factor. Network Hash Rate: The total computing power on the network. A higher hash rate means more competition, making it harder for any single miner to win block rewards. Mining Difficulty: An automatic adjustment by the Bitcoin protocol that ensures block times remain consistent (around 10 minutes) despite changes in hash rate. Higher difficulty means more computational work is required. Energy Costs: Mining consumes vast amounts of electricity, which is a major operational expense. Hardware Efficiency: Newer, more efficient mining rigs consume less power for the same amount of computing power (hash rate). Achieving record Bitcoin mining revenue means MARA Holdings effectively navigated these factors, likely benefiting from a favorable combination of Bitcoin price action, efficient operations, and possibly strategic timing or expansion. Driving Factors Behind MARA Holdings’ Performance Setting a record like this doesn’t happen by accident. Several elements likely contributed to MARA Holdings reaching over $752 million in annualized Bitcoin mining revenue: 1. Scale and Infrastructure: As one of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin miners, MARA operates a significant fleet of mining rigs. Their scale allows them to capture a larger portion of the network’s hash rate compared to smaller competitors. 2. Operational Efficiency: Investing in the latest generation of energy-efficient miners and optimizing their data center operations helps reduce electricity costs per Bitcoin mined, boosting profitability and revenue potential. 3. Strategic Deployment: Where and how miners are deployed matters. Access to reliable and potentially lower-cost energy sources is crucial for maximizing revenue and minimizing expenses. 4. Favorable Market Conditions: While operational factors are key, the price of Bitcoin itself plays a massive role. The period leading up to May 27th likely involved market conditions that supported a high annualized revenue rate. This combination of robust infrastructure, efficient operations, and market timing allowed MARA Holdings to capitalize effectively on the opportunities present in the Bitcoin mining landscape. The Dual Strategy: Mining and Accumulating Corporate Bitcoin Holdings MARA Holdings employs a strategy that combines active mining with significant accumulation of mined Bitcoin. Instead of selling all the Bitcoin they mine immediately to cover operational costs, they have historically held a substantial portion. This strategy directly leads to their large volume of Corporate Bitcoin holdings. This approach offers potential upside if the price of Bitcoin rises significantly over time, as their existing treasury grows in value alongside the Bitcoin they continue to mine. However, it also exposes the company to the volatility inherent in the cryptocurrency market. A sharp decline in Bitcoin price can negatively impact the reported value of their holdings and potentially future revenue if they need to sell mined coins at lower prices. What Does This Record Mean for Marathon Digital Going Forward? For investors and observers interested in Marathon Digital (the company’s former name still widely used) and the broader crypto market, this revenue record is a strong signal. It demonstrates the company’s capacity to generate significant income during favorable market periods. Looking ahead, Marathon Digital’s performance will continue to be influenced by the factors mentioned earlier: the price of Bitcoin, changes in network difficulty and hash rate, and their ability to expand and maintain efficient operations. Their substantial Bitcoin holdings also remain a key component of their value proposition. While past performance is not indicative of future results, achieving a record high in Bitcoin mining revenue positions MARA Holdings as a significant force in the industry, capable of generating substantial income streams under the right conditions. Summary: MARA Holdings’ Milestone Achievement In conclusion, MARA Holdings has marked a spectacular achievement by setting a new all-time high in annualized Bitcoin mining revenue, exceeding $752 million on May 27th. This record highlights the company’s operational scale and efficiency in the current market environment. Furthermore, their impressive Corporate Bitcoin holdings of over 48,000 BTC solidify their position as the second-largest public company holder of the digital asset globally. While the Bitcoin mining landscape is dynamic and subject to market volatility, this milestone underscores MARA Holdings’ significant capacity to generate revenue and accumulate value in the form of Bitcoin.

2025-05-27T22:54:16.000Z,"Taurus Accelerates Digital Asset Services in Europe and LatAm with Parafin Partnership","BitcoinWorld Taurus Accelerates Digital Asset Services in Europe and LatAm with Parafin Partnership The world of finance is rapidly evolving, with digital assets moving from the fringes into the mainstream. For financial institutions navigating this complex landscape, secure and compliant infrastructure is paramount. A significant development on this front is the recent partnership between digital asset infrastructure provider Taurus and fintech company Parafin . This collaboration is set to accelerate the adoption of digital asset services among financial institutions across Europe and Latin America, opening up new possibilities and markets. Taurus and Parafin: Forging a Powerful Alliance This strategic alliance brings together Taurus’s robust blockchain infrastructure capabilities with Parafin’s fintech expertise. Taurus is known for providing enterprise-grade solutions for digital asset custody, tokenization, and governance. Parafin, on the other hand, focuses on building platforms that facilitate financial services. By combining their strengths, they aim to offer a comprehensive, full-service platform specifically tailored for financial institutions looking to engage with digital assets. The core of this partnership involves integrating Taurus’s battle-tested technology – including its secure custody solutions, versatile tokenization engine, and sophisticated governance tools – directly into Parafin’s platform. This integration is designed to create a seamless experience for financial institutions, allowing them to securely manage, issue, and interact with a wide range of digital assets within a compliant framework. Expanding Horizons: Digital Asset Services for Europe and Latin America The partnership specifically targets financial institutions in two key regions: Europe and Latin America. Both regions present unique opportunities and challenges in the digital asset space. Europe has seen significant regulatory developments, such as MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation), providing a clearer framework but also requiring sophisticated compliance solutions. Latin America, meanwhile, is experiencing rapid grassroots crypto adoption driven by various factors, including inflation, remittances, and a desire for financial inclusion. The combined offering from Taurus and Parafin is designed to address the specific needs of financial institutions in these diverse markets. This includes providing: Secure Custody: Enabling institutions to hold digital assets safely and compliantly. Tokenization Capabilities: Allowing institutions to issue and manage tokenized securities, real estate, or other assets. Robust Governance: Providing the necessary tools for managing digital asset operations, including policy enforcement and access control. Regulatory Compliance Support: Building solutions that help institutions meet evolving regulatory requirements in both regions. This integrated approach aims to lower the technical and operational barriers for traditional financial players wanting to enter the digital asset market. Why This Matters for Financial Institutions Crypto Engagement For financial institutions, the digital asset space represents both a challenge and a significant opportunity. Client demand for crypto and other digital assets is growing. Furthermore, the potential for tokenization to unlock liquidity and create new investment products is immense. However, entering this space requires navigating complex technological, security, and regulatory hurdles. A partnership like the one between Taurus and Parafin is crucial because it provides the foundational infrastructure that financial institutions need. Instead of building complex systems from scratch or integrating disparate solutions, institutions can potentially leverage a single, integrated platform. This can accelerate their time to market for offering digital asset services, whether it’s crypto trading, tokenized fund management, or other blockchain-based products. The partnership signals a maturing of the digital asset ecosystem, where specialized infrastructure providers are teaming up with fintech platforms to deliver enterprise-grade solutions. This is essential for bridging the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets. Focusing on Growth: The Latin America Crypto Adoption Story A key driver for this partnership is Taurus’s stated expansion into Latin America. The region has emerged as a hotbed for crypto adoption, often driven by necessity and innovation. High inflation rates in several countries have led citizens to seek alternative stores of value like stablecoins and Bitcoin. Remittances, a vital part of many Latin American economies, are increasingly flowing through crypto channels due to lower fees and faster speeds compared to traditional methods. Moreover, several Latin American countries are exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) or implementing crypto-friendly regulations. This creates a fertile ground for financial institutions to offer digital asset services, but they require reliable and compliant infrastructure to do so safely and at scale. By integrating Taurus’s infrastructure into Parafin’s platform, the partnership is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth. It offers financial institutions in Latin America the tools they need to participate in the local digital asset boom, providing services that meet both international security standards and local market demands. Benefits of the Integrated Platform The collaboration between Taurus and Parafin is expected to yield several benefits for financial institutions: Streamlined Integration: Access to custody, tokenization, and governance through a single platform reduces complexity and integration costs. Enhanced Security: Leveraging Taurus’s institutional-grade security infrastructure for digital asset storage and management. Expanded Service Offering: Institutions can quickly launch new digital asset products and services for their clients. Regulatory Confidence: Utilizing infrastructure designed with compliance in mind helps institutions navigate regulatory landscapes. Scalability: The platform is built to handle the growing volume and variety of digital assets. Faster Time to Market: Reduces the time and resources needed for financial institutions to enter the digital asset space. Challenges and Opportunities Ahead While the partnership presents exciting opportunities, challenges remain. The regulatory environment for digital assets, particularly in Latin America, is still evolving and varies significantly between countries. Financial institutions also need to address internal hurdles, such as legacy systems, employee education, and risk management frameworks, to fully embrace digital assets. However, the opportunities are substantial. The partnership could enable financial institutions to offer innovative products like fractionalized real estate tokens, digital bonds, or crypto investment funds. It could also facilitate more efficient cross-border payments and asset transfers. By providing robust infrastructure, Taurus and Parafin are helping institutions overcome key barriers to entry and tap into these opportunities. Actionable Insights for Financial Institutions and the Market For financial institutions in Europe and Latin America considering digital asset services, this partnership highlights the availability of integrated, enterprise-grade solutions. It suggests that the infrastructure is increasingly ready to support institutional participation. Institutions should evaluate such platforms based on their security, compliance features, scalability, and the breadth of assets and services supported. For the broader digital asset market, this collaboration is a positive sign of increasing institutional interest and the development of the necessary ‘plumbing’ to support mainstream adoption. Partnerships that combine infrastructure expertise with financial technology delivery are key to building a more mature and accessible digital asset ecosystem. In conclusion, the partnership between Taurus and Parafin marks a significant step forward in providing robust, integrated digital asset infrastructure for financial institutions in Europe and Latin America. By combining their strengths in custody, tokenization, governance, and fintech platforms, they are poised to accelerate institutional engagement with digital assets. This collaboration not only supports Taurus’s strategic expansion but also provides essential tools for financial institutions looking to capitalize on the growing opportunities presented by the digital asset revolution in these vital regions.

The incident comes amid a string of kidnappings and ransom attempts targeting crypto investors and their loved ones, prompting additional security measures from investors and industry executives. According to reporting from The New York Times, Duplessie and crypto investor John Woeltz, who was previously arrested by police in connection with the case, both had connections to an NYC-based crypto hedge fund. Source: Jameson Lopp Duplessie negotiated his surrender with the NYPD over the course of several days leading up to his arrest.

Teofrasto said the suspects bound him, stole his passport and mobile device, and subjected him to physical beatings, which included being shocked with a Taser. The victim also said the suspects repeatedly hit him with a firearm and would submerge his feet in the water while tasing him in an attempt to get him to reveal his crypto private keys. The tourist was reportedly held in a luxury townhome in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan and escaped the luxury townhome where he was being held. Once free, Teofrasto flagged down a police officer and relayed the kidnapping incident to the official. Following his incident report, NYC police arrested crypto investor John Woeltz and charged the investor with kidnapping for ransom and three other felony counts.

2025-05-27T22:12:32.000Z,"Crypto card provider terminates services in Ukraine","Payment card issuer Weld Money is joining other crypto firms quitting business in Ukraine as a result of military restrictions and regulatory uncertainty in the invaded nation. The Ukrainian fintech urged customers to withdraw all their funds from its platform as it’s preparing to wrap up operations in the coming weeks after alleged disruptions in its services. Crypto card provider terminates services in Ukraine Weld Money, a platform that offers payment cards allowing users to spend cryptocurrency, is ceasing activities in Ukraine, following in the footsteps of other crypto companies that have lately given up on working in the country governed by martial law. On Tuesday, the startup’s team took to social media to announce its decision and explain the main reason behind it, namely, the ongoing military and regulatory restrictions in Ukraine. In the post, the fintech also advised clients to withdraw all funds from their card accounts and wallets by the end of next month, warning they may lose access after that. $WELD Money are shutting down due to military & regulatory limits in Ukraine.

Support — via Telegram: @alexeybobok #WELD #WeldMoney #crypto #shutdown #Ukraine pic.twitter.com/vhHTkS4a0Y — WeldMoney (@MoneyWeld) May 27, 2025 The move comes after customers complained in March about interruptions to Weld Money’s services on its Telegram channel, the Russian-language crypto news outlet Forklog noted in a report. Founded five years ago, Weld Money was initially specializing in traditional finance, offering users to manage accounts opened with different banks through a single mobile app. Then, in 2022, the startup joined forces with another Ukrainian fintech, Unex Bank, to launch a payment card linked to crypto wallets on two exchanges, the Ukrainian-rooted WhiteBIT and Huobi, which rebranded to HTX in 2023. The card facilitated settlements with the stablecoins USDT, USDC, BUSD, and DAI at merchants and stores accepting fiat payments through Mastercard. Weld Money shares the fate of other Ukrainian startups affected by the war The government of Ukraine has generally maintained a positive attitude towards crypto assets with a recent report revealing that the authorities in Kyiv have been taking steps to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the Eastern European nation. However, rising costs and limitations related to the war with Russia as well as delayed regulations , have taken a toll on Ukrainian crypto businesses. Earlier in May, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s office was blamed for blocking Ukraine’s long-awaited bill “On Virtual Assets.” The latter is supposed to update existing rules for the crypto space, including the taxation of profits and the size of a surcharge collected to fund defense efforts. In April, the country’s securities regulator proposed taxing crypto-related income at 18% and raising the military fee from 1.5% to 5%. Besides Weld Money, at least two other platforms have terminated Ukrainian services since the beginning of this year. In January, the digital asset exchange Kuna announced its intention to end trading activities, which it did in March. Prior to that, its website had been taken down by the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection, Ukraine’s cybersecurity agency, following a court order issued at the request of the country’s Economic Security Bureau. Kuna founder and crypto entrepreneur Mikhail Chobanyan revealed in a Telegram post, quoted by Forklog that the exchange had been accused of tax evasion. He added his team was trying to clarify the allegations and stated: “I have decided to stop all commercial activities.” On May 20, Trustee Plus stopped accepting new registrations from Ukraine, citing the regulatory conditions in the country. The crypto wallet provider said it was postponing a planned expansion in the Ukrainian market and steering its focus toward the European Union. “There are many reasons, but the most significant is the lack of legal certainty,” the company said.

The sale is expected to close on May 29.

2025-05-27T22:00:18.000Z,"XRP Price Could Reach $74 With 3rd Wave Breakout, Here’s The Timeline","XRP’s price action in the past 24 hours has been highlighted by a retracement towards support at $2.28 that has appeared in recent days. However, the XRP price action looks strong on the higher timeframes, particularly the six-month chart, where technical analysis indicates that a much larger breakout towards $74 may be in its early stages. XRP Price Still Climbing Above Long-Term Resistance Structure This interesting outlook is based on a long-term analysis of Elliott impulse waves and Fibonacci extension levels by crypto analyst Dark Defender. According to the latest chart update shared by the analyst on social media platform X, which is based on the 6-month candlestick timeframe, XRP is currently extending its run above a multi-year downtrend resistance that had capped its movement since early 2018. This resistance, described as the Ultimate Resistance, was tested multiple times over the years before being decisively breached on the six-month candle. The breakout, which resulted from a strong bullish candle in the second half of 2024, aligns with the start of a massive Elliott Wave 3. This breakout coincides with the beginning of what Dark Defender identifies as Wave (3) in the Elliott impulse wave sequence. The chart suggests that XRP completed its initial Waves (1) and (2) from 2022 through the mid-point of 2024, setting the stage for the much larger and more explosive third wave, which has been unfolding since then. The third wave in the Elliott Wave theory tends to be the strongest regarding momentum and price increase, with the analyst projecting a push to double digits by its end. According to the 361.80% Fibonacci level drawn from the base of the prior waves, the third wave is expected to push XRP to a target of approximately $18.22. Once this target is hit, a corrective Wave (4) may briefly slow the pace before the final impulsive move to new highs. Fibonacci Forecast: The Altcoin Could Explode Looking beyond Wave (3), the forecast for XRP becomes even more ambitious. Dark Defender’s projection shows a fifth wave climaxing between $66.96 and $77.70, based on the 476% Fibonacci extension. The timeline implied by the candle structure and wave count stretches toward 2027–2028 for the full completion of this five-wave cycle. If XRP continues to follow this technical roadmap, the cryptocurrency could go through the most explosive growth phase in its history. Since this is a long-term analysis, it is important to note that even the bullish impulse waves will be filled with sub-impulse waves with notable corrections as they play out . On the other hand, the analyst highlighted support levels at $2.2222 and $1.8815 that must hold for the bullish trajectory to continue based on the current price action. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.30, down by 2% in the past 24 hours.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-could-reach-74/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","XRP|Dark Defender|Elliot Wave Theory|Fibonacci Level|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare

Speaking at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, Sigel said the most viable path forward may involve inserting Bitcoin mining incentives into the congressional budget reconciliation process. According to Sigel, the most effective path to growing a US strategic Bitcoin reserve would be through targeted amendments to congressional budget legislation. These could include tax credits for mining companies that use methane gas and other incentives aimed at encouraging miners to share a portion of their mined BTC with the federal government. He argued that such an approach would allow the reserve to grow organically over time. Sigel also highlighted the limitations of executive actions in achieving this goal: \""The problem with executive action is that it's going to prompt lawsuits. And anything over $100 million is going to get sued by the Elizabeth Warrens of the world. So, I would say start with something maybe in the Exchange Stabilization Fund for $100 million.\"" US President Donald Trump established the US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve through a March 7 executive order. According to the order, the US government can only acquire Bitcoin through budget-neutral strategies or asset forfeiture, prompting a range of different ideas on how to add to the government’s stockpile of nearly 200,000 BTC.

Converting gold to Bitcoin would allow the US government to purchase more Bitcoin without incurring a cost to the taxpayer, Lummis said. Bo Hines, the executive director of the President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, echoed the idea in March 2025. Hines called on the US Treasury to revalue its gold holdings , which are currently priced at just $42.22 per troy ounce, and convert a portion of those gains to Bitcoin. This strategy would also be budget-neutral, Hines said. The price of gold reached an all-time high of $3,500 per ounce in April but experienced a minor pullback to around $3,300 on May 27.

Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, Lummis said she is bringing the BITCOIN ACT to the “attention of the American people and the world,” adding that, “President Trump supports the bill.” In March, Lummis reintroduced the BITCOIN Act — landmark legislation that directs the US government to acquire 1 million Bitcoin ( BTC ) over five years. The acquisitions would be financed using existing funds within the Federal Reserve System and the Treasury Department. As Cointelegraph reported , the Trump administration has reiterated the need to use “budget-neutral ways” to acquire Bitcoin without burdening taxpayers.

2025-05-27T21:36:53.000Z,"IMF Says 'Efforts Will Continue' to Ensure El Salvador Doesn't Accumulate More BTC","The International Monetary Fund (IMF) stated on Tuesday that \""efforts will continue\"" to make sure that the total amount of bitcoin BTC held by El Salvador's government does not change. Back in March, El Salvador reached an agreement with the IMF to receive a $3.5 billion loan package. Some of the conditions of that deal concerned bitcoin: for example, the cryptocurrency officially lost its status as legal tender, meaning that merchants no longer need to accept the currency on a mandatory basis. One of the conditions of the package, according to the IMF, was the prohibition of \""voluntary accumulation of bitcoin by the public sector.\"" In theory, that should mean that Bukele's government wouldn't be permitted to keep accumulating bitcoin if it wanted to keep complying with the loan program. Nevertheless, El Salvador has kept purchasing more bitcoin in apparent contradiction with the terms of the deal. On March 4, when the conditions of the deal were made known , the Salvadoran government held 6,101.15 bitcoin in its official wallet. As of writing, that number has risen to 6,189.18 bitcoin, a sum worth approximately $678 million. \""No, it’s not stopping,\"" Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele posted on X on March 4. \""If it didn’t stop when the world ostracized us and most 'bitcoiners' abandoned us, it won’t stop now, and it won’t stop in the future.\"" The IMF didn't seem to acknowledge any contradiction or friction in its note. In fact, it stated that program performance had been strong and that key fiscal and reserve targets had been met. \""IMF staff thank the Salvadoran authorities for the excellent collaboration and constructive discussions,\"" the report said.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/05/27/imf-says-efforts-will-continue-to-ensure-el-salvador-doesn-t-accumulate-more-btc,"BTC|FIAT|REGULATION","Policy|El Salvador|IMF|Nayib Bukele|Bitcoin|News",cryptocompare

In a recent interview with Bitcoin financial services firm Unchained, Back said the odds are stacked against traders trying to time the market. Back came to this conclusion in the early days of Bitcoin, he said, when the price “was going up basically exponentially but it [was] extremely volatile.” “So [...] if you see something that’s going up exponentially but with volatility, if you sell it to time the market a bit falling, the odds are against you,” Back said, adding: “The trend line is up and to the right, exponential, and so there’s extremely bad trading odds attached to selling because you’re really hoping that it falls.” Adam Back during the interview. Source: Unchained Bitcoin is known for its extreme volatility and heightened bull-bear market cycles. It has seen multiple corrections above 80%, which may test the stomach of many investors and believers. However, those who have remained steady through the ups and downs have been rewarded: In the last 10 years, BTC has had a total return of over 39,000%. “I think anything that has a really rapid growth curve ends up with some pretty extreme volatility until it gets closer to full adoption,” Back said.

Another contributing factor is the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin, including investments by sovereign wealth funds. He cited Abu Dhabi’s $408.5 million stake in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF.

2025-05-27T21:11:46.000Z,"BlackRock Warning Corroborates Ripple CTO On Why Quantum Computing Is a Threat to Bitcoin","In a major development that has stirred debate across the crypto landscape, investment giant BlackRock has issued a stark warning about the long-term threat quantum computing poses to Bitcoin. This warning, highlighted by Digital Assets Daily, echoes concerns voiced years ago by David Schwartz, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer and one of the original architects behind Bitcoin’s foundational cryptographic ideas. Schwartz has consistently emphasized that while Bitcoin remains highly vulnerable to advances in quantum computing, XRP was deliberately designed with quantum-resistant features to mitigate these risks. BlackRock issues warning Quantum computing is a threat to Bitcoin. David Schwartz who worked on Bitcoin is the ‘Ripple’ CTO explained this years ago and explained how XRP is quantum proof….. https://t.co/mxlcuVaPop — Digital Assets Daily (@AssetsDaily) May 27, 2025 This convergence of perspectives from Wall Street’s largest institutional player and one of crypto’s most respected technologists has reignited urgent conversations about the future-proofing of blockchain assets in an era of rapid technological change. BlackRock’s Quantum Alarm: A Reality Check for Bitcoin BlackRock’s warning did not emerge in a vacuum. As quantum computing research accelerates, scientists are increasingly confident that quantum systems could, within the next decade, break the elliptic curve digital signature algorithms (ECDSA) that secure most blockchains today, including Bitcoin. These algorithms underpin the private-public key infrastructure that ensures only legitimate holders can spend their coins. While the timeline for quantum breakthroughs remains debated, BlackRock’s intervention signals that institutional investors are no longer viewing quantum risk as a distant hypothetical but as a real, looming threat. This concern is particularly relevant as Bitcoin continues to mature into a mainstream store of value, with trillions of dollars potentially at stake if its foundational security mechanisms are rendered obsolete. David Schwartz’s Early Warnings and XRP’s Quantum Resilience Long before BlackRock’s assessment, David Schwartz was already raising the alarm. As one of the original contributors to Bitcoin’s early code and cryptographic foundations, Schwartz has a unique vantage point on the technology’s inherent strengths and weaknesses. When he transitioned to his role at Ripple, Schwartz became an outspoken advocate for building blockchain systems that could withstand the arrival of quantum computing. Schwartz has explained in public talks and interviews that XRP’s architecture was designed with quantum threats in mind. Unlike Bitcoin , which uses ECDSA exclusively, XRP’s ledger supports multiple signature algorithms, including those considered more resistant to quantum attacks, such as Ed25519. This flexibility allows XRP to adopt stronger quantum-resistant cryptographic methods without fundamentally overhauling the entire network, a critical advantage as the quantum horizon approaches. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Broader Industry Implications The BlackRock warning has reverberated across the crypto industry, sparking renewed interest in quantum-resistant blockchains and prompting questions about Bitcoin’s adaptability. Bitcoin developers have long acknowledged the risk, but upgrading Bitcoin’s cryptographic backbone is no small feat. Any major change would require broad community consensus and meticulous coordination to avoid fragmenting the network or introducing unforeseen vulnerabilities. In contrast, Ripple’s proactive approach exemplifies a broader design philosophy that prioritizes long-term adaptability. By building in cryptographic flexibility from the outset, Ripple positioned XRP as a digital asset better suited to evolve with technological advances. This architectural foresight may prove critical as the blockchain sector confronts challenges far beyond regulatory hurdles or market volatility. Preparing for a Quantum Future The fusion of BlackRock’s institutional credibility and Schwartz’s technical authority underscores a sobering truth: quantum computing is no longer a theoretical concern—it’s a ticking clock for blockchain security. While some developers argue that the industry has ample time to prepare, others warn that the window for seamless upgrades is narrowing. What’s clear is that investors, developers, and institutions alike must engage seriously with the quantum question. Assets like XRP, designed with quantum resilience in mind, may increasingly stand out in a crowded field where not all blockchains are equally prepared for the post-quantum era. As BlackRock’s warning gains traction, it corroborates years of technical foresight from Ripple’s leadership, bringing new urgency to a debate that could define the next era of digital finance. Whether Bitcoin can successfully pivot to quantum-resistant cryptography remains to be seen, but the conversation has unmistakably shifted: the future of blockchain security is quantum, and the time to prepare is now.

Alleged Kidnapper Faces Hefty Charges 33-year-old William Duplessie of Miami, FL, turned himself in to police on May 27 following Woeltz’s shocking arrest on Friday. According to reports, Duplessie and the one-time “Kentucky king of crypto” are facing charges of assault, kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment, and criminal possession of a firearm. https://twitter.com/TMZ/status/1927407076654870883 A bio on Kando.Tech lists Duplessie as the co-founder of the Switzerland-based Pangaea Digital Asset Fund, an organization that focuses on recovering distressed financial blockchain firms . Police claim Duplessie and Woeltz are business partners, though it is not immediately clear in what capacity. Italian Man Shocked, Threatened With Gun In NYC Crypto Crime The duo is believed to have kidnapped, tortured, and abused an unidentified Italian man in a bid to gain illicit access to his Bitcoin. Duplessie and Woeltz are said to have turned their backs on the 28-year-old foreign national shortly after he revealed his Bitcoin password, giving the victim just enough time to break free from captivity in the luxury Nolita apartment and flag down a nearby traffic officer for help. The man told police he was lured to New York City by the two men on May 6 before subsequently being bound, shocked, cut, threatened with a gun, and dangled over a ledge by the purported crypto captors . Reports indicate that the anonymous victim may have been a business partner of Duplessie and Woeltz, although this has not been confirmed.

2025-05-27T20:52:31.000Z,"US stock markets make a comeback after 4-day losing streak","US stock markets came roaring back on Tuesday, snapping a four-day slide after President Donald Trump postponed a massive 50% tariff on European imports. The S&P 500 gained 2.05% to close at 5,921.54, bringing relief to a market that had been under pressure since last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 740.58 points, or 1.78%, ending at 42,343.65. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.47% to 19,199.16, boosted by strong moves in major tech names like Tesla and Nvidia. The rally followed Trump’s announcement on Sunday that he had agreed to delay the proposed tariff until July 9. That decision came after a direct appeal from Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission. Trump had originally planned to roll out the 50% tariff on June 1, a move that had rattled investors. Tech climbs as Musk walks away from politics Tesla shares jumped by around 7% on Tuesday after CEO Elon Musk said he was stepping away from politics to focus more on running his companies. That headline alone drove a surge in risk appetite across the tech space. Investors piled into Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and Microsoft, pushing the Nasdaq to outperform the broader market. Outside tech, US Steel advanced by roughly 2% after reports emerged that Nippon Steel, based in Japan, is expected to finalize its $55 per share acquisition deal. The broader rally wasn’t limited to large caps either. More than 90% of stocks in the S&P 500 finished higher. Smaller companies also gained, with the Russell 2000 rising about 2.5%. Markets had been closed on Monday in observance of Memorial Day, but when trading resumed Tuesday, buying pressure overwhelmed selling across nearly every sector. The tone completely reversed after last week’s rough patch, where all three major indexes — Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq — had each lost more than 2%. On CNBC’s “Squawk Box”, Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council, said he expected to “see a few more deals even this week,” adding fuel to investor confidence. That followed the release of stronger-than-expected consumer confidence data for May, which lifted hopes for economic stability and more trade progress. Investors track earnings, watch for catalysts This week, investors are watching earnings reports to see if the rebound has legs. Okta was scheduled to report after the bell on Tuesday, while updates from Nvidia, Macy’s, and Costco are expected later in the week. FactSet reported that over 95% of S&P 500 companies have released earnings for this quarter, and nearly 78% of them exceeded expectations. But some analysts are staying cautious. In a note sent out Sunday, Adam Parker, founder of Trivariate Research, wrote: “Right now, it feels like no one has a strong conviction — bullish or bearish — about the stock market. Fundamentals might deteriorate from here.” He added that the bigger concern remains Washington’s trade relationship with China. “We tend to think, and many investors agree, that the only tariff-related conversation that really matters is what the US does with China,” Parker said. “Taking it all in, even if macro headwinds persist, there’s a growing view that S&P 500 earnings might end up being less impacted than many, including us, originally feared.” Not everyone’s waiting for signs. Dann Ryan, Managing Partner at Sincerus Advisory, said Tuesday’s sharp moves were a result of pent-up momentum. “It seems like the long holiday weekend only served to build up momentum for today’s whipsaw,” Ryan said. “The trade tensions that had flared have already been extinguished, yet again, and now they’ll include an express lane.” Outside the stock market, crypto investors had their own reason to celebrate. The crypto market cap has added about $1 trillion, a 42% increase since its April 8th low, and now sits near $3.4 trillion. That’s just 6% below its December 2024 peak. Stripping out Bitcoin, the market still rose by $319 billion, or 35%. Even so, it’s about $380 billion short of the November 2021 top and $381 billion under the 2024 record. Bitcoin was worth $109,877 at the time of writing.

According to a recent announcement, Nasdaq has submitted a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list and trade shares of the proposed 21Shares Sui ETF. This filing initiates the regulatory review process. 21Shares Strategic Deal With Sui Network Meanwhile, this move follows 21Shares’ earlier filing to register the ETF , giving traditional investors access to SUI. Notably, the proposed ETF offers investors direct exposure to the price of SUI without owning the asset. A significant difference with this 21Shares ETF filing is that it does not plan to stake any portion of its holdings to earn yield. 21Shares has also decided to collaborate with the Lyer-1 network in a “strategic partnership.” The goal of the collaboration is to expand access globally and keep up with the growing crypto ecosystem. According to 21Shares President Duncan Moir, the collaboration will cover product partnerships, research reports, and other areas of interest. Moir highlighted the Sui ecosystem’s throughput, scalability, and speed. He noted that the network has made it appealing for real-world asset tokenization, decentralized finance (DeFi), and stablecoins. While filing for an SUI ETF is a step in a series of steps to actualizing it, the collaboration could positively impact SUI. It could also increase SUI’s adoption and utility for the ecosystem. 21Shares Files for Dogecoin ETF This is not the first time Nasdaq has filed for 21Shares. Recall that Nasdaq filed with the US SEC in April to list and trade the 21Shares Dogecoin ETF . Interestingly, Nasdaq’s S-1 form filing submitted to the SEC for the 21Shares Dogecoin ETF is a big step in the approval process. The SEC will review and publish the application in the Federal Register, after which the public will have a chance to share their opinions. Once that is done, the SEC will decide whether to approve or deny the ETF. However, this move follows a separate 19b-4 form that the asset manager filed that month. The form revealed the company’s interest in offering an ETF to allow institutional investors to buy Dogecoin without holding the token directly. The Crypto ETF Race Intensifies The pursuit of crypto ETFs has gained significant traction over the past years. Competition intensified after the SEC approved spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. In January 2024, the SEC approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs and greenlighted eight Ethereum ETFs. This development has prompted a flurry of applications for other cryptocurrencies. Firms like VanEck have applied for a Solana ETF, while 21Shares has joined the race for a spot XRP ETF alongside others like Canary Capital and Bitwise.

SharpLink will invest $425 million to acquire 120,000 ETH. Ethereum futures open interest hits an all-time high of $36.1 billion, with ETH price climbing 4.5% on the daily chart. Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming (SBET) announced a $425 million private investment in public equity (PIPE), acquiring approximately 69.1 million shares at $6.15 each to establish the first Nasdaq-listed Ethereum (ETH) treasury company.Spearheaded by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, this move mirrors Strategy’s (MSTR) successful Bitcoin treasury strategy, which has yielded over $8.2 billion in gains in 2025, by leveraging stock and bond sales to acquire BTC.Former Ethereum core developer and contributor Eric Conner highlighted the bullish implications of SharpLink’s move, noting its potential to create a “public ETH proxy for funds that can’t hold tokens directly.” Conner emphasized that the acquisition of 120,000 ETH—likely to be staked—could lead to “supply compression” by removing tokens from circulation. The Ether proponent also pointed to the “new narrative fuel” this provides, positioning ETH as a “digital reserve collateral” and potentially driving its adoption on mainstream balance sheets through an equity wrapper like $SBET.However, crypto analyst VICTOR cautioned against over-enthusiasm, outlining the risk of leveraging gains from an altcoin still down 19% in 2025. In Q1 2025, Cointelegraph reported a sharp decline in Ethereum network fees, dropping to $605,000 from $2.5 million in just two weeks in March, alongside a noticeable decrease in decentralized app (DApp) activity.

Speaking at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, Sigel said the most viable path forward may involve inserting Bitcoin mining incentives into the congressional budget reconciliation process.According to Sigel, the most effective path to growing a US strategic Bitcoin reserve would be through targeted amendments to congressional budget legislation. These could include tax credits for mining companies that use methane gas and other incentives aimed at encouraging miners to share a portion of their mined BTC with the federal government. He argued that such an approach would allow the reserve to grow organically over time. Sigel also highlighted the limitations of executive actions in achieving this goal:\""The problem with executive action is that it's going to prompt lawsuits. And anything over $100 million is going to get sued by the Elizabeth Warrens of the world. So, I would say start with something maybe in the Exchange Stabilization Fund for $100 million.\""US President Donald Trump established the US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve through a March 7 executive order.

FalconX, a digital asset broker, said it secured a facility worth over $100 million as part of a “broader credit framework,” while Maple Finance reportedly closed the first tranche of an agreement with Cantor.The service allows companies holding Bitcoin to borrow funds and use the cryptocurrency as collateral, providing a way to unlock liquidity without selling their BTC holdings. Cantor announced its Bitcoin financing business with an initial capital of $2 billion in July 2024, targeting institutional investors seeking to leverage their Bitcoin. At the time, the company said Anchorage Digital and Copper would serve as custodians and collateral managers in the venture.Credit markets are a fundamental part of the financial system, allowing capital to flow between borrowers and lenders and supporting economic activity across sectors. Their central role also means they can contribute to financial distress when risks are mismanaged. While mirroring some functions of traditional finance, crypto credit markets have been operating with less regulatory oversight.Digital asset crisis of 2022 This dynamic was evident during the 2022 crisis in the digital asset sector. Celsius Network, once a leading crypto lending platform, collapsed after engaging in risky financial practices and facing allegations of fraud. Similarly, BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2022 following significant exposure to the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.  According to a report from Galaxy, the total crypto lending market, including crypto-backed collateralized debt positions (CDPs) tied to stablecoins, stood at $36.5 billion in the last quarter of 2024, marking a 43% decline from its all-time high of $64.4 billion in 2021. Despite the broader contraction, onchain lending platforms have seen a dramatic rebound, with open borrowed positions surging to $19.1 billion by Q4 2024, a 959% increase over two years.

Bitcoin’s bullish momentum aligns with the favorable US financial conditions, as noted by Ecoinometrics. The macroeconomic-focused Bitcoin newsletter highlighted that the National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) shows a rapid shift to ultra-loose territory after a tightening phase in February 2025. The NFCI, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, tracks stress in the financial system by aggregating measures like credit spreads, leverage, and funding conditions. When the index moves into looser territory, it reflects easier access to capital and reduced market stress—conditions that typically encourage risk-taking behavior among investors. For high-beta assets like Bitcoin, such periods often coincide with price rallies as capital flows into speculative markets.US National Financial Conditions Index.

2025-05-27T15:40:00.000Z,"93% of all Bitcoin is already mined. Here’s what that means","How much Bitcoin is left to mine?              Bitcoin’s total supply is hardcoded at 21 million BTC, a fixed upper limit that cannot be altered without a consensus-breaking change to the protocol. This finite cap is enforced at the protocol level and is central to Bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset.As of May 2025, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoin (BTC) have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created, and those remaining coins will be mined very slowly.The reason for this uneven distribution is Bitcoin’s exponential issuance schedule, governed by an event called the halving. When Bitcoin launched in 2009, the block reward was 50 BTC. Every 210,000 blocks — or approximately every four years — that reward is cut in half. Because the early rewards were so large, over 87% of the total supply was mined by the end of 2020. Each subsequent halving sharply reduces the rate of new issuance, meaning it will take over a century to mine the remaining 6.7%.According to current estimates, 99% of all Bitcoin will have been mined by 2035, but the final fraction — the last satoshis — won’t be produced until around the year 2140 due to the nature of geometric reward reduction.This engineered scarcity, combined with an immutable supply cap, is what draws comparisons between Bitcoin and physical commodities like gold. But Bitcoin is even more predictable: Gold’s supply grows at around 1.7% annually, whereas Bitcoin’s issuance rate is transparently declining.Did you know? Bitcoin’s supply curve is not terminal in the traditional sense. It follows an asymptotic trajectory — a kind of economic Zeno’s paradox — where rewards diminish indefinitely but never truly reach zero. Mining will continue until around 2140, by which point over 99.999% of the total 21 million BTC will have been issued.                  Beyond the supply cap: How lost coins make Bitcoin scarcer than you think              While over 93% of Bitcoin’s total supply has been mined, that doesn’t mean it’s all available. A significant portion is permanently out of circulation, lost due to forgotten passwords, misplaced wallets, destroyed hard drives or early adopters who never touched their coins again.Estimates from firms like Chainalysis and Glassnode suggest that between 3.0 million and 3.8 million BTC — roughly 14%-18% of the total supply — is likely gone for good. That includes high-profile dormant addresses like the one believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, which alone holds over 1.1 million BTC.This means Bitcoin’s true circulating supply may be closer to 16 million-17 million, not 21 million. And because Bitcoin is non-recoverable by design, any lost coins stay lost — permanently reducing supply over time.Now compare that to gold. Around 85% of the world’s total gold supply has been mined — approximately 216,265 metric tons, according to the World Gold Council — but nearly all of it remains in circulation or held in vaults, jewelry, ETFs and central banks. Gold can be remelted and reused; Bitcoin cannot be resurrected once access is lost.This distinction gives Bitcoin a kind of hardening scarcity, a supply that not only stops growing over time but quietly shrinks.As Bitcoin matures, it’s entering a monetary phase similar to gold: low issuance, high holder concentration and increasing demand-side sensitivity. But Bitcoin takes it further; its supply cap is hard, its loss rate is permanent, and its distribution is publicly auditable.This may lead to several outcomes:Increased price volatility as available supply becomes more limited and sensitive to market demandHigher long-term value concentration in the hands of those who remain active and secure in their key managementA premium on liquidity, where actually spendable BTC trades at a higher effective value than dormant supply.In extreme cases, this could produce a bifurcation between “circulating BTC” and “unreachable BTC,” with the former gaining greater economic significance, particularly in times of constrained exchange liquidity or macroeconomic stress.                  What happens when Bitcoin is fully mined?              There’s a popular assumption that as Bitcoin’s block rewards shrink, the network’s security will eventually suffer. But in practice, the mining economy is far more adaptive — and much more resilient — than that.Bitcoin’s mining incentives are governed by a self-correcting feedback loop: If mining becomes unprofitable, miners drop off the network, which in turn triggers a difficulty adjustment. Every 2,016 blocks (roughly every two weeks), the network recalibrates mining difficulty using a parameter known as nBits. The goal is to keep block times steady at around 10 minutes, regardless of how many miners are competing.So, if Bitcoin’s price drops, or the reward becomes too small relative to operating costs, inefficient miners simply exit. This causes difficulty to fall, lowering the cost for those who remain. The result is a system that continually rebalances itself, aligning network participation with available incentives.This mechanism has already been tested at scale. After China banned mining in mid-2021, Bitcoin’s global hashrate dropped by more than 50% in a matter of weeks. Yet the network continued to function without interruption, and within a few months, the hashrate fully recovered, as miners resumed operations in jurisdictions with lower energy costs and more favorable regulations.Critically, the idea that lower rewards will inherently threaten network security overlooks how mining is tied to profit margins, not nominal BTC amounts. As long as the market price supports the cost of hash power — even at 0.78125 BTC per block (post-2028 halving) or lower — miners will continue to secure the network.In other words, it’s not the absolute reward that matters, but whether mining remains profitable relative to costs. And thanks to Bitcoin’s built-in difficulty adjustment, it usually does.Even a century from now, when the block reward approaches zero, the network will likely still be protected by whatever combination of fees, base incentives and infrastructure efficiency exists at that time. But that’s a distant concern. In the meantime, the current system — hashrate adjusts, difficulty rebalances, miners adapt — remains one of the most robust elements of Bitcoin’s design.Did you know? On April 20, 2024, following the launch of the Runes protocol, Bitcoin miners earned over $80 million in transaction fees within a single day, surpassing the $26 million earned from block rewards. This marked the first time in Bitcoin’s history that transaction fees alone exceeded the block subsidy in daily miner revenue.                  The future of Bitcoin mining: Energy consumption              It’s a common misconception that rising Bitcoin prices will drive endless energy use. In reality, mining is constrained by profitability, not price alone.As block rewards shrink, miners are pushed toward thinner margins, and that means chasing the cheapest, cleanest energy available. Since China’s 2021 mining ban, hashrate has migrated to regions like North America and Northern Europe, where operators tap into surplus hydro, wind and underutilized grid energy.According to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, between 52% and 59% of Bitcoin mining now runs on renewables or low-emission sources. Regulations are reinforcing this trend, with several jurisdictions offering incentives for clean-powered mining or penalizing fossil-fuel operations.Moreover, the idea that higher BTC prices will always mean higher energy use misses how Bitcoin self-regulates: More miners raise difficulty, which compresses margins, capping energy expansion. Renewable-based mining brings its own challenges, but the dystopian future of endlessly expanding fossil-fueled hash power is increasingly unlikely.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/93-of-all-bitcoin-is-already-mined-heres-what-that-means?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T15:00:00.000Z,"ZKPs can prove I&#039;m old enough without telling you my age","Opinion by: Andre Omietanski, General Counsel, and Amal Ibraymi, Legal Counsel at Aztec LabsWhat if you could prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthday, name, or anything else at all? Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) make this hypothetical a reality and solve one of the key challenges online: verifying age without sacrificing privacy. The need for better age verification todayWe're witnessing an uptick in laws being proposed restricting minors' access to social media and the internet, including in Australia, Florida, and China. To protect minors from inappropriate adult content, platform owners and governments often walk a tightrope between inaction and overreach. For example, the state of Louisiana in the US recently enacted a law meant to block minors from viewing porn. Sites required users to upload an ID before viewing content. The Free Speech Coalition challenged the law as unconstitutional, making the case that it infringed on First Amendment rights. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed on procedural grounds. The reaction, however, highlights the dilemma facing policymakers and platforms: how to block minors without violating adults' rights or creating new privacy risks.Traditional age verification failsCurrent age verification tools are either ineffective or invasive. Self-declaration is meaningless, since users can simply lie about their age. ID-based verification is overly invasive. No one should be required to upload their most sensitive documents, putting themselves at risk of data breaches and identity theft. Biometric solutions like fingerprints and face scans are convenient for users but raise important ethical, privacy, and security concerns. Biometric systems are not always accurate and may generate false positives and negatives. The irreversible nature of the data, which can't be changed like a regular password can, is also less than ideal. Other methods, like behavioral tracking and AI-driven verification of browser patterns, are also problematic, using machine learning to analyze user interactions and identify patterns and anomalies, raising concerns of a surveillance culture.ZKPs as the privacy-preserving solutionZero-knowledge proofs present a compelling solution. Like a government ID provider, a trusted entity verifies the user's age and generates a cryptographic proof confirming they are over the required age. Websites only need to check the proof, not the excess personal data, ensuring privacy while keeping minors at the gates. No centralized data storage is required, alleviating the burden on platforms such as Google, Meta, and WhatsApp and eliminating the risk of data breaches. Recent: How zero-knowledge proofs can make AI fairerAdopting and enforcing ZKPs at scaleZKPs aren't a silver bullet. They can be complex to implement. The notion of \""don't trust, verify,\"" proven by indisputable mathematics, may cause some regulatory skepticism. Policymakers may hesitate to trust cryptographic proofs over visible ID verification. There are occasions when companies may need to disclose personal information to authorities, such as during an investigation into financial crimes or government inquiries. This would challenge ZKPs, whose very intention is for platforms not to hold this data in the first place.ZKPs also struggle with scalability and performance, being somewhat computationally intensive and tricky to program. Efficient implementation techniques are being explored, and breakthroughs, such as the Noir programming language, are making ZKPs more accessible to developers, driving the adoption of secure, privacy-first solutions. A safer, smarter future for age verificationGoogle's move to adopt ZKPs for age verification is a promising signal that mainstream platforms are beginning to embrace privacy-preserving technologies. But to fully realize the potential of ZKPs, we need more than isolated solutions locked into proprietary ecosystems. Crypto-native wallets can go further. Open-source and permissionless blockchain-based systems offer interoperability, composability, and programmable identity. With a single proof, users can access a range of services across the open web — no need to start from scratch every time, or trust a single provider (Google) with their credentials.ZKPs flip the script on online identity — proving what matters, without exposing anything else. They protect user privacy, help platforms stay compliant, and block minors from restricted content, all without creating new honeypots of sensitive data.Google's adoption of ZKPs shows mainstream momentum is building. But to truly transform digital identity, we must embrace crypto-native, decentralized systems that give users control over what they share and who they are online.In an era defined by surveillance, ZKPs offer a better path forward — one that's secure, private, and built for the future.Opinion by: Andre Omietanski, General Counsel, and Amal Ibraymi, Legal Counsel at Aztec Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-27T14:30:00.000Z,"What is a cryptocurrency mixer and how does it work?","Cryptocurrency mixers explained              A cryptocurrency mixer is a specialized service designed to increase the privacy and anonymity of blockchain transactions. Unlike traditional financial transactions, which are private by default, most cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) operate on public blockchains. This means every transaction is permanently recorded and accessible to anyone, making it possible for blockchain analysts or malicious actors to trace the flow of funds between wallets.A crypto mixer’s primary function is to break the link between the sender’s wallet and the recipient’s wallet. It does so by pooling together coins from many users and then redistributing them in a way that makes it difficult to track which coins went where. Think of it like a digital version of shuffling cards in a deck. After mixing, your cryptocurrency is returned to you or a recipient’s address, but it’s “cleaned” of any direct transaction history.This privacy-enhancing feature is why some people rely on mixers, especially those seeking to keep their financial activities confidential in an open-ledger world.                  How does a crypto mixer work?              To understand a crypto mixer, it’s useful to compare it to the concept of money laundering in traditional finance, albeit with legal and ethical nuances. The process of “mixing” is essentially designed to obscure the origin and destination of coins.Here’s a typical workflow of how a cryptocurrency mixer operates:Deposit: You send your cryptocurrency to the mixer’s wallet address. Multiple users do the same, creating a large pool of coins.Mixing/shuffling: The mixer’s system pools and shuffles these coins together, breaking any visible connection between deposited and withdrawn funds.Redistribution: After mixing, the service sends back an equivalent amount of coins to your specified address, but these aren’t the same coins you deposited. They come from the pooled coins of all participants.Fees: The mixer usually deducts a small fee, generally ranging from 1% to 3%, to cover operational costs.This process effectively disrupts blockchain analysis, making it extremely difficult for anyone to trace the coins back to their original owners.                  Types of cryptocurrency mixers              Not all mixers are created equal. They can broadly be divided into two categories: centralized and decentralized mixers.Centralized mixersCentralized mixers are the most common and operate similarly to traditional services. You send your coins to a company or entity that controls the mixing process, and then they send back “clean” coins after mixing. These services are relatively easy to use, often providing a simple user interface.However, centralized mixers require you to trust the service operator with your coins, at least temporarily. This introduces risks such as:The mixer could be a scam and disappear with your funds.It could be hacked, exposing users’ data and coins.The operator may keep logs that could compromise your privacy.Decentralized mixersDecentralized mixers use blockchain technology and smart contracts to automate the mixing process without a trusted third party. They rely on cryptographic methods such as zero-knowledge proofs to mix coins in a trustless environment. Users pool their coins into a smart contract, which then redistributes coins in a way that ensures privacy.Advantages of decentralized mixers include:No central point of failure or custody risk.Higher privacy because no single party controls the funds.Often more resistant to regulatory crackdowns.Did you know? The DOJ indicted four Russians for operating crypto mixers Blender.io and Sinbad.io, yet failed to show they knowingly laundered illicit funds. The indictment relies heavily on vague forum posts and lacks concrete evidence of criminal intent or ties to US commerce, raising serious doubts about its strength in court.                  Real-world cases involving mixers and scams              Unfortunately, the privacy offered by crypto mixers has also attracted criminals. The very anonymity that protects innocent users can also shield illicit activities, leading to widespread misuse.Crypto mixers have been linked to ransomware attacks, dark web marketplaces, fraud and drug trafficking. Criminals often use these services to “clean” proceeds from illegal transactions and hide their tracks from law enforcement.A notable example is ChipMixer, a service seized by Europol in 2023 for allegedly facilitating money laundering for dark web markets and ransomware groups. Authorities dismantled the platform’s infrastructure over alleged money laundering, seizing four servers, 1,909.4 BTC (about $210 million as of May 26, 2025) and seven TB of data across 55 transactions.Mixers have also been involved in laundering stolen funds from cryptocurrency exchange hacks. The complexity of these transactions makes it difficult for investigators to recover stolen assets.In February 2025, Bybit, a major cryptocurrency exchange, suffered a significant security breach resulting in the theft of about $1.5 billion worth of cryptocurrencies. The attackers, attributed to the Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking organization, employed various crypto mixers, including Wasabi, CryptoMixer, Railgun and Tornado Cash, to launder portions of the stolen assets. Despite efforts to trace the funds, a significant portion remains unaccounted for, highlighting the challenges posed by mixers in cybersecurity investigations.                  Are crypto mixers legal?              The legal status of cryptocurrency mixers depends largely on the jurisdiction and context of their use.Most governments impose strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing regulations on financial services, including digital currency services. Mixers, by their nature, complicate AML compliance because they obscure transaction trails.For instance,In the European Union, the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD) includes digital currency providers under its regulatory scope, requiring them to perform KYC checks and report suspicious activity.In the United States, FinCEN classifies cryptocurrency mixers as money transmitters, requiring registration and compliance with AML regulations. Unlicensed mixers can face severe penalties and criminal charges.Legal uses vs misuseUsing a mixer for privacy reasons is not inherently illegal. However, if mixers are used to launder proceeds from crimes, authorities will prosecute offenders. Similarly, operating a mixer without appropriate licenses or regulatory oversight can be illegal.If you choose to use a mixer, make sure you understand the legal implications in your country and avoid any activity that could be linked to money laundering or fraud.Did you know? Crypto mixer transactions are still taxable. Using a mixer doesn’t hide gains from tax authorities; failing to report them can trigger audits or penalties. Always keep records and understand your local tax obligations.                  How to stay safe and avoid scam-linked mixers              If you decide to use a cryptocurrency mixer, your safety and security should be paramount. Here are some essential tips to avoid scams and legal troubles:Choose reputable mixers: Conduct thorough research. Look for mixers with good reviews, transparent operations and clear compliance policies.Avoid unknown or suspicious services: Steer clear of mixers linked to scams, hacks or regulatory actions.Check for licensing and compliance: Prefer mixers that comply with AML/KYC regulations, especially if you are a business or high-value user.Understand fees and timelines: Be clear on the fees involved and the expected time for your funds to be returned after mixing.Use hardware wallets and strong security practices: Always safeguard your private keys and use hardware wallets to minimize risks.Stay updated on regulations: Laws surrounding crypto mixers evolve rapidly. Staying informed will help you avoid inadvertent legal violations.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-mixer-and-how-does-it-work?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T13:19:38.000Z,"How to research altcoins using ChatGPT and Grok","Investments in the fast-paced cryptocurrency market require real-time insights and efficient research. With thousands of projects emerging or disappearing, you need innovative ways to separate signal from noise. AI solutions such as ChatGPT and Grok could benefit you as your research assistant, reducing research time and delivering actionable information. This article discusses how to use both platforms to make better decisions regarding investment in altcoins.How to share content with ChatGPT and GrokBoth ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 allow you to share content in three ways. You can simply paste content in the text box with inverted commas and write your prompt. Alternatively, you can upload a document from your local drive or Google Drive on ChatGPT 4o. If you are working with Grok 3, you could upload a file from your local drive or connect a file on Google Drive and Microsoft Drive to the AI platform.On both ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3, you can paste a link in the text box and write a prompt for the AI engine.Use ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 to analyze complex data and draw quick conclusionsChatGPT 4o excels at processing and simplifying extensive and often fragmented information. Altcoin projects tend to have extensive white papers and technical documentation. It takes time to get through all the information, analyze it, and draw conclusions. With ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3, you can easily get the information you need without spending hours reading the content. You can use the AI platforms for:Summarizing extensive documentation: You could get a quick summary of vast information that might go into thousands of words, using a prompt like “Summarize this document in plain English with pros, cons and use cases.”Analyzing tokenomics: You could ask the AI platforms for the altcoin project’s breakdown of inflation, token distribution and staking models. For example, you could use a prompt such as “Explain the tokenomics of [Altcoin Name] and its impact on price.” Deconstructing roadmaps: Projects often publish unrealistic roadmaps that are hard to implement. AI platforms could quickly analyze the relevancy of roadmaps and suggest to you what you could expect of them. You could use prompts like, “What are the most realistic milestones in this roadmap for 2025?”Spotting red flags: The goal is not just to understand but to spot red flags, such as overpromising, vague goals or lack of technical updates. Did you know? ChatGPT is trained on vast crypto data sets and can explain trends, decode memes, or simplify DeFi tools — even if you are just starting your crypto learning journey.Ask for competitive comparisons on ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 can be valuable tools for quickly comparing different cryptocurrency projects. To begin with, state the names of the cryptocurrencies you want to compare. Also mention the criteria such as use case, consensus process, tokenomics and development activities. For example, you can use the prompt, “Create a table comparing Solana and Avalanche in terms of transaction speed, fees and developer adoption.” Here is a response from ChatGPT 4o:And this is Grok 3’s response for the same prompt:AI tools typically use tables or bullet points for an answer. You can also ask additional questions to delve deeper into topics like security, scalability and partnerships. This allows for more efficient evaluation of many projects without the need to search through multiple sources.To get a market-layer view on ChatGPT 4o, you can use the prompt: “Create a table of five layer-1 altcoins with higher throughput than Ethereum and evaluate their adoption metrics.” Here is the output of ChatGPT 4o:Grok 3 gave the following response using the same prompt:These comparisons help you map out where each altcoin stands relative to its peers and whether it offers a genuine edge.Did you know? Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot was built with a rebellious tone. It excels at quickly pulling crypto insights directly from social chatter, perfect for memecoin hunters.Find info about developer activityDeveloper traction is a dependable indicator of an altcoin’s long-term potential. Use ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 to find information about overall growth in development activity, surges after certain upgrades, developer count and contributions, commit activity, network upgrades and challenges before developers.You could use prompts like:“What has been the developer activity trend on [Project ] over the last 6 months?”You can also request ecosystem breakdowns with prompts like:“List top DeFi projects built on Arbitrum with TVL over $10 million.”ChatGPT 4o generated the following response for this prompt:Here is Grok 3’s response for the same prompt:ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 can synthesize data points from multiple sources and give you a cleaner picture faster than manual web browsing. You could track sudden price spikes with a prompt like:“In 100 words, write why is $RNDR trending right now?”Here is ChatGPT 4o’s response for this prompt:This is Grok 3’s response for the same prompt:Grok 3 is particularly useful for monitoring real-time sentiment and news. Grok 3 is ideal for real-time analysis of trends, especially on X, where crypto narratives form quickly. Grok 3 will pull recent posts, mentions and news threads to explain the momentum. It can monitor influencer sentiment.For deeper and quicker research, you can use ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 together.Don’t just trust the bots — verify the alphaAI tools like ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 offer powerful support in the altcoin research process, enabling faster analysis, broader comparisons and streamlined access to information. However, even advanced AI models can occasionally misinterpret data or miss contextual nuances. As such, it is essential to treat their responses as a starting point — not a final answer.When using these tools, take the time to compare outputs, evaluate the sources referenced, and cross-check insights against real-world data. Discrepancies between ChatGPT and Grok responses should prompt further investigation, not automatic preference.Ultimately, these platforms are most effective when used to enhance critical thinking and research efficiency rather than replace human judgment.In a fast-moving industry like Web3, effective research requires diligence, curiosity and verification. By applying these principles, you can make more confident and informed investment decisions in the altcoin space.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-27T12:00:15.000Z,"StarkWare launches mobile-friendly zero-knowledge prover","Blockchain company StarkWare has unveiled zero-knowledge (ZK) prover STARK Two (S-two), enabling enhanced privacy and verification on everyday devices like phones, laptops and browsers. The company said the new ZK prover allows users to generate complex cryptographic proofs from the client side. This means users can generate ZK-proofs directly on their devices instead of relying on a server or cloud infrastructure, opening the door for faster and more private applications across the internet. “S-two will bring STARK proving to everyday devices, and open the door for new real-world proving use cases,” said Eli Ben-Sasson, StarkWare co-founder and CEO, adding that the tool could empower the next wave of ZK applications. The company said the ZK prover is now available in public alpha and is set to roll out on Starknet, its Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, later this year.  StarkWare says new ZK prover is 39 times faster than old solutions StarkWare said that benchmark tests for the S-two ZK prover showed that it was 39 times faster than previous solutions. The performance leap enables smoother experiences in privacy-enhancing applications. The upgrade also allows use cases in private transactions, ZK-based identity and verifiable artificial intelligence. StarkWare said S-two runs on CPUs, GPUs and will soon be on browsers. “For years we’ve called the prover our magic wand, a tool that transforms complex computation into a simple proof,” Ben-Sasson said. “Now, the wand has become a lightsaber in your pocket, something anyone can wield, instantly, from your own device.”According to StarkWare, developers can build with S-two, adding that its alpha release supports hardware targets. Furthermore, the company said ZK ecosystem participants like Kakarot, Nexus, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs have already adopted the technology. Kakarot uses S-two inside ETHProofs to generate Ethereum block proofs more efficiently, while Nexus is standardizing RISC-V traces to align with S-two’s architecture. Meanwhile, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs are adding GPU acceleration to push the prover’s performance even further.Use cases for S-two zero-knowledge proverStarkWare chief operating officer Oren Katz told Cointelegraph that S-two marks a shift in how ZK-proofs are used in daily lives. Generating validity proofs directly in devices will allow privacy-preserving features in messaging, payments and digital identity. “You can prove a payment was valid without showing your balance, or verify identity without revealing personal details,” Katz added. Katz said that even salary payments could be made onchain with full transparency and no exposure of sensitive information. He dubbed the development a “big step toward bringing zero-knowledge tech into the mainstream.”Beyond privacy, Katz said, local proof generation also unlocks use cases in other industries. The executive told Cointelegraph that it can allow gamers to play offline and later generate cryptographic proof of their achievements. “An operator, instead of running all logic onchain to prove integrity, can run it on their own servers and simply generate a proof that it was executed correctly,” Katz added.Related: Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden’s cashless-society rethinkNew ZK prover follows Ethereum’s privacy pushThe launch of StarWare’s upgraded ZK prover follows Ethereum’s push for better privacy. On April 11, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin published a roadmap that addressed privacy enhancements for wallets, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and infrastructure. Buterin advocated implementing privacy-enhancing norms and features across the Ethereum ecosystem, including adding privacy tools in ETH wallets. Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/starkware-unveils-s-two-client-side-zk-prover?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The executive said Bitget directly manages the reserve pool, which includes stable, on-hand assets like USDC. According to Chen, BGUSD does not fall under the definitions of a stablecoin or a security and is not subject to specific licensing requirements. “It’s structured as a yield-bearing stable asset certificate that’s exclusive to the Bitget platform,” Chen told Cointelegraph.Chen added that Bitget will limit access to BGUSD in jurisdictions where digital asset restrictions apply.  Related: Stablecoins’ dominance due to limitations of US banking — Jerald DavidYield-bearing stablecoins surge to $11 billionBitget’s move into yield-bearing stablecoins comes as the asset class has surged to $11 billion. According to a Pendle report, yield-bearing stablecoins climbed from $1.5 billion at the start of 2024 to $11 billion as of May 21. This represents 4.5% of the entire stablecoin market. The growth of yield-bearing stablecoins is attributed to increasing regulatory clarity in the United States under President Donald Trump’s administration. According to a Feb. 18 filing, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved exchange operator Figure Markets’ interest-bearing stablecoin. This made the company the first to receive US approval for a yield-bearing stablecoin. Apart from a favorable response from the SEC, proposed bills like the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) also signal a positive direction for stablecoins in the US. Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitget-enters-real-world-asset-race-with-yield-bearing-bgusd-stablecoin?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T08:45:00.000Z,"How central banks are testing blockchain-based monetary policy","Why are central banks looking at blockchains?              Central banks are tiptoeing into the world of blockchain not because it is fashionable but because every part of the money-making machine, from settlement rails to asset custody, is slowly being rewritten as code.The financial industry is already tokenizing money-market funds, Treasurys and even bank deposits. According to the Atlantic Council, 134 jurisdictions are studying or piloting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), up from just 35 in 2020. Meanwhile, commercial banks have begun to warn that if they cannot move tokenized deposits across public blockchains such as Solana or private ledgers like R3 Corda, they risk being left behind.From a central bank’s vantage point, two questions matter:First, can traditional operations, such as open-market purchases, standing facilities and reserve remuneration still work if reserves and government bonds become smart tokens? Second, can monetary transmission improve when policy logic is hard-wired into code? These questions motivate pilots such as Project Pine, Project Guardian in Singapore, the Bank of England’s wholesale CBDC sandbox and Japan’s multiyear retail CBDC pilot.                  What is “tokenized” monetary policy?              Tokenized monetary policy means that the liabilities and assets a central bank uses to steer short-term interest rates exist as programmable tokens on a distributed-ledger platform. In such a token arrangement, what the BIS describes as an ecosystem where money and securities share a common ledger, monetary functions are executed by smart contracts, replacing the traditional batch file processes used in overnight real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems.In practice, each policy tool is expressed as code:Interest on reserves becomes an automated coupon that accrues to a wallet address once a block closes.Repo and reverse-repo agreements become conditional asset swaps that self-liquidate at maturity.Collateral haircuts are numeric parameters the central bank can toggle in real time, with changes propagating instantly to all counterparties.Project Pine demonstrated all three, using ERC-20 tokens for reserves and securities on a permissioned Ethereum-compatible chain.But how is tokenized monetary policy different from traditional monetary policy?Traditional policy operations rely on central bank systems such as Fedwire or the Bank of England’s RTGS. These systems close overnight, settle in discrete batches and require multiple human sign-offs. A tokenized system settles atomically in seconds, keeps an immutable audit trail and lets policy adjustments propagate without waiting for dealers to book trades. The BIS paper on tokenisation notes that combining assets and settlement on a single ledger can shrink operational risk and latency.Did you know? A repo is a short-term secured loan in which one party sells securities and agrees to repurchase them later at a higher price. In contrast, a reverse repo is the same transaction viewed from the counterparty’s perspective (buying the securities and later reselling them).                  What is Project Pine?              Project Pine is a research initiative led by the BIS Innovation Hub and the New York Fed that explores how central banks could run monetary policy in a future where money and government securities are digital tokens managed on blockchain-like systems.Launched in late 2024 and published in May 2025, the project built a working prototype, a “starter kit” for central banks, designed to test whether tools like interest on reserves, repo operations and asset purchases can be run using smart contracts.The project ran simulated financial scenarios, mimicking both calm and crisis conditions:Normal conditions: The smart contract automatically conducted a one-day reverse-repo, draining reserves by posting bids at a pre-set interest rate.Liquidity shock: When simulated market stress pushed interest rates too high, an emergency lending facility kicked in automatically, within seconds, helping stabilize rates.Asset-purchase program: The toolkit accepted bids, calculated allocations and settled trades between digital reserves and tokenized bonds instantly.These scenarios were run in a test environment with simulated commercial banks and a programmable blockchain platform. Everything from interest payments to collateral valuation was automated, providing a glimpse into how monetary policy might function in a 24/7, tokenized financial system.This was not an isolated experiment. Other central banks are running parallel pilots that explore similar ground with their distinct approaches:Although temporarily offline as of May 24, 2025, MAS news releases show that Singapore’s Project Guardian has tested tokenized deposits and government bonds in live repo transactions, proving that interbank settlement can occur on a shared DLT without sending payments through Swift.Meanwhile, the Bank of England has taken a dual-rail approach. A July 2024 discussion paper stresses that wholesale tokenized money could sit alongside RTGS balances, letting commercial banks pick whichever rail meets their liquidity needs. Governor Andrew Bailey has warned that if tokenized deposits stall, the Bank “must continue to prepare for a wholesale CBDC.”On the retail front, Japan’s multi-year programme has entered a live “pilot” phase, constructing an end-to-end infrastructure, from smartphone wallets to a central ledger, capable of handling tens of thousands of transactions per second. The pilot also explores privacy-enhancing overlays, reflecting consumer expectations for cash-like anonymity.Taken together, these pilots confirm that key features like programmability, real-time visibility, and atomic settlement are no longer theoretical — they work. They don’t yet answer the more challenging question: How do central banks transition an entire financial system to such rails without disrupting credit creation and intermediation?Did you know? Project Pine’s digital monetary system is built like a three-layer cake: The bottom layer is a programmable blockchain (Besu), the middle is packed with tokenized money and assets (like ERC-20 reserves) and the top layer runs the smart contracts that carry out monetary policy actions.                  Why is Project Pine important?              Project Pine is the first of its kind to show that core central bank tools could be rebuilt using smart contracts. It proves that:Policy tools can be deployed faster, possibly within seconds.Facilities like repo or asset purchases can adapt automatically to changing market conditions.Tokenization could streamline operations, reduce friction and offer greater flexibility.Who was involved in Project Pine experiments?Seven major central banks, including those of Australia, Canada, England, Mexico, Switzerland, the EU and the US, collaborated on shaping the toolkit and defining test requirements. The findings don’t commit any of these banks to adopt such systems, but they provide a solid foundation for future research and policymaking.What did Project Pine test?To see how well the system works, Project Pine ran tests based on real-world situations, such as raising interest rates or a government debt crisis. They tried short and long periods, small and large financial systems, tight and loose money conditions and different ways of lending (like bank loans or corporate bonds). This helped check if the system could handle all kinds of economic ups and downs.Did you know? In Project Pine, central bank operations like paying interest on reserves or managing collateral aren’t done manually; they're handled by smart contracts coded directly into the top “protocol layer” of the blockchain stack.                  Practical design challenges in tokenized monetary policy              As central banks explore moving policy tools onto blockchains, they face several significant design hurdles. These aren’t just technical. They’re legal, operational and even philosophical. Here are the key ones:Interoperability: Can different blockchains talk to each other? Today’s financial system is like a highway with shared rules. However, blockchain ecosystems are more like separate islands, each with its own rules and roads. Public networks like Solana, private ones like Corda, or permissioned platforms like Besu don’t always “talk” to each other smoothly. This can cause issues like payment delays or funds getting stuck between platforms. Experts also warn that if too many users gather around one dominant blockchain, it could create unhealthy concentration, making the whole system more fragile.Legal finality: Does blockchain data legally count? Many countries still treat blockchain records as transaction evidence, not legally binding proof of ownership. So, even if a tokenized treasury bond moves onchain, the law might still require a separate “golden record” kept offchain by a trusted authority. Until legal systems catch up, this split could limit how far tokenized finance can go.Cyber resilience: What happens when something goes wrong? Blockchain systems run on code, and that code can have bugs. In a traditional setup, if something breaks, humans can step in. But with smart contracts, “code is law.” That’s why countries like Japan are building complete backup plans into their pilots. They’re testing how to respond to cyberattacks, technical failures or even smart contract glitches because in a digital money system, even a small error could have significant consequences.Privacy vs transparency: How much should be visible? Banks and regulators need transparency to monitor financial risks and prevent crime. But regular people want privacy, especially when using money for everyday purchases. Balancing those two needs is tricky. Policymakers are now experimenting with ideas like tiered disclosure (more visibility for big transactions), zero-knowledge proofs (which let you prove something without revealing all details), and even “anonymity vouchers” that let users make some transactions without being tracked.These challenges aren’t deal-breakers, but they do show that making money programmable isn’t as simple as flipping a switch. Central banks must work closely with lawmakers, cybersecurity experts and the financial industry to ensure tokenized monetary systems are safe, fair and reliable.                  The road ahead              The future of tokenized monetary policy will likely unfold in carefully staged phases, balancing innovation with financial stability.The BIS Innovation Hub lists more than a dozen ongoing tokenization projects from Australia’s Project Dunbar (multi-CBDC bridge) to Switzerland’s Project Helvetia (DLT-based repo). Commercial banks, meanwhile, are shifting rails: HSBC settled its first tokenized-deposit payment in April 2025, and Euroclear is piloting blockchain settlement for tokenized bonds.Central banks face a coordination game: Go slow and risk private standards hardening around them; go too fast and upend the funding model of commercial banks. The likeliest path is a phased approach:Stage 1: Limited-scope wholesale CBDC sandboxes plus tokenized collateral for central-bank counterparties.Stage 2: Dual-rail environments where RTGS balances and tokenized reserves interoperate via synchronization layers.Stage 3: Full adoption of smart-contract-based policy tools, possibly including real-time fiscal transfers.Just as earlier shifts like the rollout of RTGS systems or inflation-targeting regimes were introduced gradually to test and refine their impact, tokenized systems will be phased in through pilots, sandboxes and hybrid models before full-scale adoption.Whether it ultimately reshapes how central banks manage the economy remains to be seen.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-central-banks-are-testing-blockchain-based-monetary-policy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave.However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation.This caused the long-term holder realized capitalization to surge past $28 billion, a level not seen since April. Realized cap is a measure of the value of each Bitcoin based on the last time it was moved, rather than the current market price.Long-term investors are using this period of forced selling to increase their exposure and accumulate more Bitcoin for the long run, Amr Taha noted. “This strategic accumulation during moments of market stress reflects the deep conviction of LTHs.”“Rather than being shaken out by short-term volatility, they [LTH] see these liquidation-driven dips as prime opportunities to strengthen their positions, reinforcing the foundation for future price appreciation.”BTC short-term holders (red) and long-term holders (green) net realized cap.

Gox, but said proof-of-reserves isn’t the correct measure to take for institutions.“No institutional-grade or enterprise security analyst would think it’s a good idea to publish all of the wallet addresses, such that you could be traced back and forth.”“Go to AI, put it in deep think mode and then ask it ‘what are the security problems of publishing your wallet addresses?’ and ‘how might it undermine the security of your company over time,” Saylor said, adding it would write “50 pages of security problems.”Proof-of-reserves increasingly adopted after FTX collapseMany crypto exchanges, custodians and exchange-traded fund issuers started publishing their proof-of-reserves following FTX’s collapse in November 2022 to establish transparency and prove that they hold enough assets to back customer deposits.Related: Strategy bags 4,020 Bitcoin as price briefly breaks $110KCrypto exchanges Binance, Kraken and OKX and crypto asset manager Bitwise are among the industry players that have adopted the transparency measure.However, Saylor noted that proof-of-reserves often only show one side of the picture — what the company holds — and not what they owe.Source: Mitchell AskewSaylor’s Strategy is the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 576,230 Bitcoin worth $62.6 million on its balance sheet, followed by Bitcoin mining firm MARA Holdings, which holds 48,137 Bitcoin, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET.More than 110 publicly traded companies worldwide have purchased and hold Bitcoin.Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/michael-saylor-says-proof-of-reserves-bad-idea?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Since the world has infinite unpredictable possibilities, LeCun believes training must happen through abstraction, which mirrors how humans make sense of the physical world.Meta’s AI brain drain Meanwhile, Meta is experiencing significant talent loss from its AI research team, particularly among the researchers who created the original Llama model in 2023, Insider reported on May 26. Just three of the original 14 Llama authors remain at Meta, and many have joined Mistral, a Paris-based startup co-founded by former Meta researchers and key Llama architects. Meta’s latest release, Llama 4, received a lukewarm reception from developers, many of whom now look to faster-moving rivals that have dedicated reasoning models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o, Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, and the recently launched Claude 4 Sonnet from Anthropic, the report added. On May 15, The Wall Street Journal reported that Meta was delaying the rollout of its flagship AI LLM, Llama 4 “Behemoth.” Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/meta-ai-boss-ai-lacks-intelligent-behavior-report?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

However, FOX5 New York reported that the man may already be in custody, citing conflicting sources.The New York Post reported that the man is the co-founder of a Swiss trading firm.Woeltz, known as the “crypto king of Kentucky,” is facing several charges, including kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment and assault. He allegedly held the victim at his apartment for 17 days.Woeltz’s assistant, Italian-born Beatrice Folchi, was also arrested, however, she was freed, and no charges have been laid against her.The arrests came after Teofrasto Carturan, aged 28 from Italy, managed to escape the apartment on May 23 — the day he had allegedly been told would be his “death day.”CNN reported that Teofrasto Carturan agreed to give up his crypto seed phrase, which was stored on his laptop in another room, and as he went to get his laptop, Woeltz turned his back, allowing him to bolt to the exit.Several New York news outlets shared videos of the victim running outside, barefoot, toward a traffic officer.Sometime after, police arrested Woeltz at his Soho apartment and took him into custody.He remains detained, and his next court date is set for May 28.Alleged victim shares ordealTeofrasto Carturan claimed to police that he arrived from Italy on May 6 and went to the Soho apartment to meet his “business partners.”Sometime later, he claimed his passport was token he was tortured to reveal his crypto seed phrase.

Antpool CEO Andy Chow said:\""Antpool has become the bridge operator for Bitlayer to support Bitcoin innovation and protect miners’ interests.”BitVM (Bitcoin Virtual Machine) is a framework that enables complex smart contracts to be deployed on the Bitcoin blockchain without changing the base protocol. The idea was introduced by Robin Linux in 2023, and allows for the complex computation involved in smart contract systems to be verified onchain and executed offchain in a way resembling optimistic rollups.Related: Here’s how Bitcoin is transforming into Web3’s backboneA BitVM implementationBitlayer is a BitVM implementation, aiming to allow Bitcoin to flow through decentralized finance (DeFi) systems and layer-2 networks. According to Chow, the implementation might lead to heightened activity in Bitcoin’s network and generate revenue for miners:“This expansion of Bitcoin’s use cases will drive more network activity, generating additional transaction fees and revenue opportunities for miners. As block rewards decrease over time, growing fee markets are critical for miners’ sustainable income.“Mining pools such as Chow’s Antpool play a critical role in the adoption of BitVM implementations because they directly determine the inclusion and validation of new types of transactions and scripts at the consensus layer.BitVM requires miners to include custom Taproot-based transactions that encode interactive verification logic. Mining pools must agree to include these non-standard or computationally intensive scripts in blocks, otherwise the protocol would simply not function.Related: StarkWare researchers propose smart contracts for Bitcoin with ColliderVMMining pool supportAccording to Hashrate Index data, Antpool controls 17.2% of Bitcoin’s hashrate as of May 26, while F2Pool controls 8.2% and Spiderpool 6.1%. This results in a total supporting hashrate of  31.5%.Bitcoin hashrate distribution between mining pools. Source: Hash Rate IndexThis is enough to secure transaction inclusion in under one in every three blocks. This is presumably enough for testing, prototyping and early-stage applications.With this percentage of supporting hashrate, developers can build functional systems with the assumption that, despite some latency, BitVM transactions will be processed. So while it is hard to view this hashrate as allowing a fully functional deployment, it is likely enough for the early phases of BitVM development.A Bitlayer representative told Cointelegraph that “should collective hashrate support weaken or policy shifts occur within Bitcoin Core, we have a multi-layered contingency plan.” This plan includes the “expanded mining pool partnerships,” referring to the company’s intention to keep onboarding more mining pools.Magazine: ZK-proofs are bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin — BitcoinOS and Starknet",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitlayer-secures-40-of-bitcoin-s-hashrate-to-bring-smart-contracts-to-btc?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

European stock markets responded positively to the development, but Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to hold the $110,000 level, leading traders to question whether a new all-time high remains within reach.Even if Bitcoin revisits the $105,000 mark, rising institutional interest and robust derivatives markets indicate that bullish traders are neither overleveraged nor concerned about a potential correction.Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized basis rate. Source: laevitas.chDemand for leveraged long Bitcoin positions grew, as evidenced by the BTC futures premium increasing to 8% on May 26. Although this was a modest rise from 6.5% the previous day, the metric still sits comfortably within the neutral range of 5% to 10%. For context, in December 2024, the Bitcoin futures premium surged to 20% when BTC surpassed $100,000 for the first time.Will Nvidia earnings and US economic data ignite Bitcoin price? President Trump’s decision to delay the EU import duties until July 9 reduced some market uncertainty, yet the broader economic consequences of the ongoing tariff conflict have yet to show up in corporate earnings. Investor risk appetite now hinges in part on Nvidia's (NVDA)  May 28 earnings report, and anticipation for this possibly explains Bitcoin’s inability to break through its previous highs.Bitcoin options markets are signaling an increased probability of upward movement.

2025-05-26T16:25:55.000Z,"Decentralized AI could be ‘bigger than Bitcoin’ — DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino","Some of blockchain’s earliest adopters are now deeply “entrenching” themselves in decentralized AI, with ecosystems like Bittsenor (TAO) emerging as growth engines. These platforms are reshaping traditional venture capital models, enabling the best ideas to organically attract community support, staking and liquidity without the need for institutional gatekeepers.That was one of the key takeaways from Cointelegraph’s interview with Chris Miglino, the co-founder and CEO of DNA Fund, a digital asset investment firm he runs alongside fellow serial entrepreneurs Brock Peirce and Scott Walker.DNA Fund manages, among other things, five distinct funds across a range of strategies, such as a high-yield fund, an algorithmic trading fund, an AI compute fund, a liquid token fund and a venture fund — serving both company and investor capital. DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino, right, and Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi at a DNA House event in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphMiglino, who hosted Cointelegraph at a DNA House event during the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, was particularly excited about the firm’s AI compute fund.“The biggest thing that we’re working on in the whole ecosystem is our AI compute fund, where we’ve been entrenched into the TAO ecosystem,” said Miglino, referring to Bittensor, a decentralized, open-source machine learning network.Bittensor’s backers say the network stands out for its subnets, which enable specialized, incentive-based marketplaces built around a specific AI or machine learning use case. DNA Fund is “actively mining on different subnets,” having committed roughly $50 million worth of compute to the TAO ecosystem, Miglino said. “We’re willing and ready to talk to anybody that wants to launch inside that ecosystem,” he said.A snapshot of Bittensor subnets. Source: TaostatsRelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AI‘Decentralized AI is consuming everything we’re doing’Decentralized AI — the framework for developing and deploying artificial intelligence systems across a distributed network rather than a centralized authority — is currently the main focus at DNA House, Miglino said.It’s “consuming everything we’re doing,” he said. For Miglino, this paradigm has the opportunity to be “bigger than anything that’s ever existed [...] I think it has the opportunity to be bigger than Bitcoin.”While that may appear as a herculean task, given Bitcoin’s (BTC) $2.1 trillion market cap and status as the first successful decentralized monetary system of the information age, technologists broadly agree that AI will profoundly reshape human society.The AI takeover will become more apparent by the 2030s, when the technology is projected to become the world’s valuable tech sector. Source: United Nations Trade and DevelopmentDNA House is betting that ecosystems like Bittensor will drive that transformation in a decentralized way by offering developers the ability to launch businesses without having to raise outside capital: “Develop on the ecosystem, get validators that believe in your idea, [and] that’ll attract the miners and the validators together and all of a sudden you’re in business. You don’t need to go out and raise a ton of money from a bunch of VCs.”The idea that AI’s future will be decentralized is far from fringe. One of the earliest pioneers of artificial general intelligence, Ben Goertzel, told Cointelegraph that he realized the need for decentralization in AI as far back as the early 1990s, before even writing his first line of AI code.Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/decentralized-ai-bittensor-dna-fund-ceo?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-26T15:15:00.000Z,"BlackRock issues rare warning: Is Bitcoin’s future at risk from quantum tech?","BlackRock Bitcoin warning              In a rare move, BlackRock has quietly added a new line to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing — and it is turning heads. The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin’s long-term security.The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin. In their words, it could “undermine the viability” of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack.It’s the first time you’ve seen the world’s largest asset manager call out this threat so directly in a Bitcoin-related disclosure, and it says a lot about how seriously institutional players are starting to take future-proofing crypto.Yes, exchange-traded fund (ETF) risk disclosures tend to be exhaustive by nature. But the fact that quantum computing made the cut (alongside more common concerns like volatility and regulatory shifts) suggests it’s no longer just a hypothetical issue in the eyes of big finance.For investors, this signals two things: first, that Bitcoin isn’t immune to emerging tech threats, and second, that institutional players like BlackRock are actively weighing those risks as they build long-term strategies in crypto. The message is clear: If the industry wants to stay ahead, preparing for a post-quantum world can’t wait.Did you know? As of early 2025, BlackRock manages over $11.6 trillion in assets, making it the largest asset manager globally. To put that in perspective, BlackRock’s assets under management exceed the combined GDP of Germany and France.                  Bitcoin quantum risk: Is it real?              Quantum computers work differently from the laptops and servers we use today. Instead of crunching numbers one at a time, they can process huge numbers of possibilities at once. That makes them incredibly powerful — especially when it comes to cracking codes.Bitcoin’s security relies on two major cryptographic systems: SHA-256 and ECDSA. In plain terms, these are the tools that secure your Bitcoin address and make sure only you can authorize transactions. They’ve worked flawlessly for years, but quantum computers could change that.Here’s the worry: A powerful enough quantum computer might be able to reverse-engineer your private key from your public address, especially during that short window after you’ve broadcast a transaction but before it’s confirmed on the blockchain. If that ever became possible, someone could hijack your transaction and steal your coins.That sounds dramatic, but it’s not an immediate threat. Most researchers agree they’re still at least 10-20 years away from quantum machines that could actually pull this off. The tech just isn’t there yet — not at the scale or stability needed to break Bitcoin’s cryptography.Still, the warning signs are flashing. Roughly a quarter of existing Bitcoin (BTC) sits in older wallet formats that could be more vulnerable if quantum leaps happen faster than expected. And even if the timeline is long, the crypto community knows it has to act early. Work is already underway on post-quantum cryptography, which is a security system that could stand up to the next generation of computing.Did you know? Quantum computers can, in theory, solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. For instance, Google’s Sycamore processor completed a specific task in 200 seconds, whereas it would take even the most advanced classical supercomputers approximately 10,000 years to finish.                  Is Bitcoin safe from quantum computing?              While quantum computing still feels like a future problem, the crypto industry is already gearing up for it, and the efforts underway are more serious than most people realize.What Bitcoin’s doing (and not doing yet)Changing the protocol behind a blockchain is never simple; you need broad consensus, careful testing and a long lead time. But that hasn’t stopped developers from floating ideas regarding Bitcoin.One of the most talked-about proposals is something called QRAMP, the Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol. The idea is to push users to move their coins from older, potentially vulnerable wallet formats into addresses protected by newer, quantum-safe algorithms. It would require a hard fork, so it’s no small lift, but it’s a serious plan to future-proof the network before a so-called “Q-Day” sneaks up.Who’s already ahead?Some blockchains aren’t waiting around. Algorand, for example, has already integrated Falcon, a post-quantum digital signature algorithm that’s been officially vetted by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). That means transactions on Algorand are already being backed by encryption that could hold up even if quantum machines go live tomorrow.The Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) is another big one. It was built from day one with this threat in mind, using XMSS (a hash-based signature scheme) instead of traditional cryptography. It’s not a major player in market cap terms, but it’s one of the most advanced projects in terms of pure security design.Why it’s not easyOf course, none of this is simple to implement. Quantum-safe cryptography often comes with trade-offs. Algorithms like Falcon are compact and efficient, but they still require more computing resources than traditional ones. Moreover, switching everyone — miners, exchanges, wallet apps and individual users — to a new cryptographic standard could be a logistical nightmare unless it’s planned years in advance.Plus, there’s a delicate balance to strike. Move too soon, and you risk breaking things or relying on tech that isn’t battle-tested. Wait too long, and you’re exposed. That’s why many in the space are eyeing a 10-to-20-year window as a rough estimate for when quantum computing becomes a real threat. But even then, nobody wants to be the last to prepare.                  Bitcoin’s future and quantum computing              If there’s one lesson from quantum conversation so far, it’s this: Being early matters. When it comes to tech that could one day rewrite the rules of digital security, waiting around just isn’t an option.So, what does preparation look like?For developers, it starts with testing and integrating quantum-resistant algorithms into existing systems. Some are already experimenting with “hybrid” approaches, using both traditional and post-quantum cryptography side by side, so networks aren’t caught off guard if (or when) Q-Day arrives.For crypto businesses — exchanges, custodians and wallet providers — the job is twofold: Make sure your infrastructure is future-proof, and make sure your users know what’s coming. Education and UX will play a huge role here. Migrating keys and updating protocols isn’t something the average holder can or should do alone.And then there’s the regulatory side — maybe not the most exciting part of crypto, but an absolutely critical one in this context.You are already seeing movement: The NIST finalized several post-quantum cryptographic standards in 2024. That gives the industry a starting point, a common language to build around. But what’s still missing is a clear regulatory push that says, “Here’s how and when this should happen.”Good policy here wouldn’t mean clamping down on innovation — it would mean supporting it. Think: funding open-source research, incentivizing post-quantum upgrades and creating frameworks that help institutions adopt secure standards without killing momentum.Did you know? The US government began preparing for the quantum threat as far back as 2016, and in 2024, the NIST’s move was sparked by growing fears that quantum computers could one day break the encryption protecting everything from Bitcoin to national security infrastructure.A slow burn BlackRock didn’t need to bring up quantum risk in its ETF filing — but it did. And when a company of that size puts it in writing, it turns vague rumors into something much more real.The transition to a quantum-resistant crypto world isn’t going to happen overnight. It’ll be messy, slow and full of tough technical choices. But it has to happen. Finally, waiting until quantum computers are actively breaking SHA-256 in the wild would already be too late.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blackrock-issues-rare-warning-is-bitcoins-future-at-risk-from-quantum-tech?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-26T15:00:00.000Z,"AI needs better human data, not bigger models","Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at SapienAI is a paper tiger without human expertise in data management and training practices. Despite massive growth projections, AI innovations won’t be relevant if they continue training models based on poor-quality data. Besides improving data standards, AI models need human intervention for contextual understanding and critical thinking to ensure ethical AI development and correct output generation.AI has a “bad data” problemHumans have nuanced awareness. They draw on their experiences to make inferences and logical decisions. AI models are, however, only as good as their training data.An AI model’s accuracy doesn’t entirely depend on the underlying algorithms’ technical sophistication or the amount of data processed. Instead, accurate AI performance depends on trustworthy, high-quality data during training and analytical performance tests.Bad data has multifold ramifications for training AI models: It generates prejudiced output and hallucinations from faulty logic, leading to lost time in retraining AI models to unlearn bad habits, thereby increasing company costs.Biased and statistically underrepresented data disproportionately amplifies flaws and skewed outcomes in AI systems, especially in healthcare and security surveillance.For example, an Innocence Project report lists multiple cases of misidentification, with a former Detroit police chief admitting that relying solely on AI-based facial recognition would lead to 96% misidentifications. Moreover, according to a Harvard Medical School report, an AI model used across US health systems prioritized healthier white patients over sicker black patients. AI models follow the “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO) concept, as flawed and biased data inputs, or “garbage,” generate poor-quality outputs. Bad input data creates operational inefficiencies as project teams face delays and higher costs in cleaning data sets before resuming model training.Beyond their operational effect, AI models trained on low-quality data erode the trust and confidence of companies in deploying them, causing irreparable reputational damage. According to a research paper, hallucination rates for GPT-3.5 were at 39.6%, stressing the need for additional validation by researchers.Such reputational damages have far-reaching consequences because it becomes difficult to get investments and affects the model’s market positioning. In a CIO Network Summit, 21% of America’s top IT leaders expressed a lack of reliability as the most pressing concern for not using AI.Poor data for training AI models devalues projects and causes enormous economic losses to companies. On average, incomplete and low-quality AI training data results in misinformed decision-making that costs companies 6% of their annual revenue.Recent: Cheaper, faster, riskier — The rise of DeepSeek and its security concernsPoor-quality training data affects AI innovation and model training, so searching for alternative solutions is essential.The bad data problem has forced AI companies to redirect scientists toward preparing data. Almost 67% of data scientists spend their time preparing correct data sets to prevent misinformation delivery from AI models.AI/ML models may struggle to keep up with relevant output unless specialists — real humans with proper credentials — work to refine them. This demonstrates the need for human experts to guide AI’s development by ensuring high-quality curated data for training AI models.Human frontier data is keyElon Musk recently said, “The cumulative sum of human knowledge has been exhausted in AI training.” Nothing could be farther from the truth since human frontier data is the key to driving stronger, more reliable and unbiased AI models.Musk’s dismissal of human knowledge is a call to use artificially produced synthetic data for fine-tuning AI model training. Unlike humans, however, synthetic data lacks real-world experiences and has historically failed to make ethical judgments.Human expertise ensures meticulous data review and validation to maintain an AI model’s consistency, accuracy and reliability. Humans evaluate, assess and interpret a model’s output to identify biases or mistakes and ensure they align with societal values and ethical standards.Moreover, human intelligence offers unique perspectives during data preparation by bringing contextual reference, common sense and logical reasoning to data interpretation. This helps to resolve ambiguous results, understand nuances, and solve problems for high-complexity AI model training.The symbiotic relationship between artificial and human intelligence is crucial to harnessing AI’s potential as a transformative technology without causing societal harm. A collaborative approach between man and machine helps unlock human intuition and creativity to build new AI algorithms and architectures for the public good.Decentralized networks could be the missing piece to finally solidify this relationship at a global scale.Companies lose time and resources when they have weak AI models that require constant refinement from staff data scientists and engineers. Using decentralized human intervention, companies can reduce costs and increase efficiency by distributing the evaluation process across a global network of data trainers and contributors.Decentralized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) makes AI model training a collaborative venture. Everyday users and domain specialists can contribute to training and receive financial incentives for accurate annotation, labeling, category segmentation and classification.A blockchain-based decentralized mechanism automates compensation as contributors receive rewards based on quantifiable AI model improvements rather than rigid quotas or benchmarks. Further, decentralized RLHF democratizes data and model training by involving people from diverse backgrounds, reducing structural bias, and enhancing general intelligence.According to a Gartner survey, companies will abandon over 60% of AI projects by 2026 due to the unavailability of AI-ready data. Therefore, human aptitude and competence are crucial for preparing AI training data if the industry wants to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.Data infrastructure for AI model training requires continuous improvement based on new and emerging data and use cases. Humans can ensure organizations maintain an AI-ready database through constant metadata management, observability and governance.Without human supervision, enterprises will fumble with the massive volume of data siloed across cloud and offshore data storage. Companies must adopt a “human-in-the-loop” approach to fine-tune data sets for building high-quality, performant and relevant AI models.Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at Sapien.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-26T14:47:14.000Z,"Veteran capital in crypto is shaping South Korea’s elections","Cryptocurrency has emerged as a defining issue in South Korea’s snap presidential election, with candidates vying for support from a growing base of digital asset investors across generations.All three front-runners have rolled out crypto-friendly proposals. These include the legalization of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the easing of banking rules that currently restrict fiat-to-crypto trading to just five platforms.The June 3 vote is slated to come around two years early, triggered by the impeachment of former president Yoon Suk-yeol after his controversial declaration of martial law in late 2024. Though quickly overturned by lawmakers, the abrupt power grab led to a political crisis and his eventual removal from office.Yoon’s 2022 campaign leaned heavily on promises to reform crypto regulations — largely aimed at younger voters. This time, the political focus on digital assets has only intensified, as older generations begin to pour significant wealth into digital assets.Three leading presidential candidates have promised pro-crypto policies.Presidential election debate clash on stablecoinsThis election has three leading candidates, and all of them have promised to advance the local crypto economy.Lee Jae-myung of the opposing Democratic Party lost to Yoon in the last election and returns with a second crypto-friendly campaign.Kim Moon-soo is running under the current ruling party, the People Power Party (PPP). Former president Yoon has distanced himself from the PPP ahead of the election, leaving Kim to define a new direction for the fractured conservative base.Lee Jun-seok was once the youngest-ever leader of the PPP. He is now leading his own newly formed Reform Party, a minor party he founded in January 2024 after splitting with the ruling bloc.“The political sphere has actively embraced [cryptocurrencies] as a key campaign agenda,” Park Sung-jun, head of the Blockchain Research Center at Dongguk University, told Cointelegraph.“Driven by the transition to a digital economy, the push for transparency in political funding, the spread of blockchain-based political participation technologies and growing demands for investor protection, [crypto] has emerged as a significant economic, social and political issue in South Korea.”Lee Jae-myung and Kim have both pledged to ease strict banking rules that require crypto exchanges to partner with licensed banks to offer fiat services — a system that has created a near-monopoly of just five approved platforms. The structure in place excludes corporate participation, as it requires users to open accounts at partner banks using their legal identities.Lee has also proposed launching a stablecoin pegged to the won to reduce reliance on tokens issued abroad.Related: South Korean crypto emerges from failed coup into crackdown seasonLee Jun-seok pushed back, noting that South Korea once had a won-pegged algorithmic stablecoin, TerraKRW (KRT), part of the Terra ecosystem that suffered a multibillion-dollar collapse.“Lee Jae-myung proposes launching another stablecoin without presenting any safeguards. What assets will back it? How will market risks be handled? How will we avoid repeating past failures?

2025-05-26T13:59:11.000Z,"10 red flags that scream ‘fake airdrop,’ and how to avoid them","Key takeawaysIn 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams targeting Hamster Kombat, Wall Street Pepe and others led to millions in user losses, contributing to over $9.9 billion in global crypto scam damages.Fake airdrops impersonate legitimate projects, tricking users into revealing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying upfront fees that lead to irreversible crypto theft.Warning signs include no official announcement, suspicious URLs, requests for private keys, grammar errors and unrealistic reward promises.Future airdrops are shifting toward activity-based, retroactive and AI-monitored models that reward genuine user engagement while reducing exploitation.While cryptocurrency airdrops are a legitimate way for projects to gain publicity and users, scammers exploit this hype, draining wallets through fake campaigns. In 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams around projects like Hamster Kombat and Wall Street Peepe cost victims millions. According to Chainalysis, the global estimated losses in 2024 from cryptocurrency scams and fraud, which included fake airdrops, amounted to at least $9.9 billion. Spotting red flags is crucial to staying safe from fake airdrops. This article explores key warning signs and practical tips to protect your funds. What are fake airdrops?Airdrops are a common practice of distributing free tokens in the crypto world as part of marketing campaigns, user acquisition efforts, or community-building exercises. Legitimate airdrops reward early takers, increase token visibility, or promote network activity. Getting airdrops requires minimal effort, like signing up, joining a community or holding a specific token.However, the popularity of airdrops has also drawn scammers. They exploit user greed and curiosity by promising free tokens (fake airdrops) in exchange for sensitive actions such as sharing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying gas fees. Fraudsters may impersonate real projects using spoofed domains or fake social media accounts.These scams often look convincing, and even experienced users can fall victim. This is the reason consistent vigilance is required when you are getting airdrops. Did you know? In 2023, Inferno Drainer helped scammers steal over $80 million through airdrop phishing campaigns. Operating as a “drainer-as-a-service,” it lets affiliates use prebuilt kits to run scam airdrop sites, targeting wallets across several blockchains.Key red flags that expose ‘fake airdrops’Before you connect for an airdrop, learn to spot the warning signs. These red flags are your first line of defense against losing your crypto or sensitive information to scammers:1. No official announcement from verified channelsWhat to watch for: A major warning sign of a fake airdrop is the lack of any announcement on the project’s official communication channels. Scammers often use unsolicited direct messages, unofficial Telegram groups or poorly crafted websites mimicking legitimate ones to promote fake airdrops.How to avoid: Always verify the legitimacy of an airdrop by checking the project’s official website, verified X account or official Discord/Telegram channels before clicking any links. If the airdrop isn’t mentioned there, keep away from it.2. Request for private key or seed phraseWhat to watch for: A critical red flag of a fake airdrop is a request to “verify” your wallet by providing your private key or seed phrase. These scams deceive users into surrendering complete control of their crypto wallets by posing as eligibility checks. Once shared, scammers can immediately steal all assets.How to avoid: Genuine airdrops never ask for your private key or recovery phrase, which should always remain confidential. If anyone or any website requests these, it is a clear scam. Exit the page immediately.3. Upfront gas fees or crypto paymentsWhat to watch for: A significant warning sign of a fake airdrop is that it requires upfront gas fees or cryptocurrency payments to “unlock” tokens. Scammers often insist you send Ether (ETH) or other coins to claim rewards, but after the payment, the promised tokens never materialize, and your funds are lost.How to avoid: Legitimate airdrops are free, typically involving only simple tasks like connecting a wallet or completing minor actions. If an airdrop demands any payment, it is likely to be a scam. Never send funds to unfamiliar addresses.4. Suspicious URLs or clone sitesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops frequently employ phishing websites resembling legitimate crypto platforms. These sites aim to deceive users into connecting wallets and signing fraudulent transactions.How to avoid: You need to carefully check a project’s URL before executing any transaction on it. There will likely be subtle differences, such as misspellings, extra characters or alternate domain extensions.Did you know? Some airdrops use retroactive criteria, rewarding users based on past activity. This encourages organic participation before the airdrop announcement, so simply using DApps naturally could make you eligible for future free tokens.5. Poor grammar and urgent languageWhat to watch for: Many fake airdrops feature poor grammar, spelling errors or aggressive phrases like “Claim Now Or Lose Out!” or “Final Chance For Free Tokens!” These tactics aim to create panic, rushing users into clicking malicious links without careful thought. Sloppy writing and intense urgency are clear signs of a scam.How to avoid: Legitimate crypto projects communicate professionally and clearly. If an airdrop announcement contains errors or uses high-pressure, time-sensitive language, steer clear. 6. Fake social proof or bot commentsWhat to watch for: Scammers frequently use fake airdrop posts filled with fabricated social proof, such as comments like “I just got 500 $XYZ!” or “Totally legit!” These are often posted by bots or fake accounts to create a false sense of trust and encourage participation. They might also use fake or hacked celebrity accounts to disseminate false information regarding airdrops.How to avoid: Avoid trusting social media comments alone to determine an airdrop’s legitimacy. Research the token thoroughly, confirm its presence on reputable platforms, and seek authentic user feedback on forums like Reddit or trusted crypto Discord groups. Genuine projects maintain transparent communities, not just artificial hype.7. Unknown or nonexistent token projectsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops promote tokens tied to obscure or nonexistent projects, which might lack a white paper, roadmap, official website or verifiable team. Scammers use these fabricated tokens to trick users into connecting wallets or approving transactions that result in stolen funds.How to avoid: Always research a token extensively before participating in an airdrop. Check for a white paper, official website, team credentials and active community presence. If the project lacks basic details or appears suspiciously new with no credible background, it is likely fraudulent.8. Token approval trapsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops entice users to connect their wallets and grant token spending permissions. These seemingly harmless “approval” requests can allow scammers to freely transfer or drain your tokens without further interaction, exploiting the granted permissions.How to avoid: Exercise caution when approving token transactions, particularly from unfamiliar sources. Avoid authorizing smart contract interactions on untrusted websites. Regularly use tools like revoke cash to check and cancel unnecessary token approvals.9. Redirects to malicious wallet drainersWhat to watch for: Some fake airdrop links redirect users to malicious DApps known as wallet drainers. These sites are designed to resemble legitimate claim pages but execute malicious smart contracts once a wallet is connected. By clicking “claim airdrop,” users unknowingly sign transactions that give scammers full access to their funds.How to avoid: Always review transaction pop-ups carefully before signing. Use browser wallets like MetaMask with built-in phishing protection and stay updated on known scam domains. If a site looks unfamiliar or triggers unexpected approvals, disconnect immediately. 10. Unrealistic reward promisesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops often attract users with unrealistic promises, such as “Instantly claim $2,000 in free tokens!” with no effort required. These offers exploit greed and curiosity, luring users into connecting wallets or signing transactions without proper scrutiny.How to avoid: Be suspicious of extravagant claims. Genuine airdrops usually provide modest rewards and have certain eligibility criteria. If an offer appears too good to be true, it is likely to be fraudulent.Did you know? In 2021, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) gave governance tokens via an airdrop to anyone who had registered a .eth name. Many ENS holders received thousands of dollars just for owning a crypto domain name.Examples of fake airdropsHere are some examples of well-known fake airdrops to help you understand how these fraudulent actions scam unsuspecting victims:Hamster KombatHamster Kombat is a Telegram-based tap-to-earn game where players manage a virtual crypto exchange as a hamster CEO. By tapping, completing daily tasks and upgrading, players earn HMSTR coins, which are convertible to tradable tokens. Launched in March 2024, it attracted over 250 million users, but scams targeting players have raised concerns.Malicious actors targeted Hamster Kombat to profit from the tap-to-earn game’s viral popularity. Kaspersky warned users about fake Hamster Kombat airdrops, meant to steal victims’ crypto wallet credentials.Wall Street PepeWall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is an Ethereum-based memecoin that combines meme culture with practical trading utilities. Inspired by the Pepe meme and Wall Street trading, $WEPE provides small traders with unique market insights, strategic analysis and a supportive community.The $WEPE airdrop scam mimicked the legitimate token's website. It lured users with promises of an airdrop and prompted them to connect their digital wallets, inadvertently signing malicious contracts that drained their assets.HEXHEX is a token built on Ethereum to help users capitalize on cryptocurrency market growth through a system that supports coin locking and staking for fixed durations. The fraudulent webpage replicated the official HEX site. The airdrop on this counterfeit site was fake and unrelated to the genuine HEX project or other initiatives. When a crypto wallet was linked to the deceptive site, it activated a malicious contract that enabled the cryptocurrency drainer to steal funds.SuiSui (SUI) is a layer-1 blockchain and smart-contract platform engineered for speed, privacy and accessibility, featuring a distinctive object-centric data model.When users checked airdrop eligibility on the fraudulent webpage posted by the scammers, they were prompted to link their digital wallets. This action unwittingly signed a malicious contract, enabling the cryptocurrency drainer. Consequently, their funds were automatically transferred to wallets controlled by scammers through seamless, unauthorized transactions.LayerZeroThe LayerZero airdrop implemented a novel \""proof-of-donation\"" claiming system. Instead of distributing $ZRO tokens for free, as typical airdrops do, LayerZero required users to donate $0.10 per token to the Protocol Guild, which supports Ethereum’s core developers.In July 2023, security firm CertiK cautioned users to be careful about fake airdrops being promoted on X by accounts impersonating Layer Zero. When users clicked on the links, they were sent to a website that resembled the official LayerZero website.How crypto airdrops are evolving from freebies to secure community rewardsCrypto airdrops are advancing beyond basic token giveaways, adopting more advanced and secure approaches to engage users. Projects increasingly implement activity-based airdrops, rewarding users for contributions like staking, testing apps or engaging in governance. This shift seeks to promote authentic community involvement and prevent exploitative tactics. Novel distribution models such as snapshot-based allocations and retroactive rewards are gaining traction. These approaches enhance transparency and ensure tokens reach active community contributors. Integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning improves fraud detection and strengthens airdrop security by helping detect bots, fake wallets and fraudulent behavior, making airdrops more secure and resistant to exploitation.This transformation reflects the evolution of responsible, effective token distribution practices that align with decentralization and community empowerment goals.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-26T13:12:20.000Z,"How to read Bitcoin candlestick charts (no experience needed)","Key takeawaysBitcoin candlesticks are a popular tool among Bitcoin traders because they’re simple to use and offer an intuitive way to understand market sentiment and trends.Bitcoin candlesticks are a rather old tool. Rice trader Honma Munehisa invented them in Japan as far back as the 18th century. They were introduced to Western financial markets in the late 1980s.They help you understand bullish and bearish patterns in technical analysis. This knowledge will get you started with Bitcoin trading.They should not be your only tool for making informed decisions. Combine them with other Bitcoin technical indicators, such as MAs (moving averages) or the RSI (relative strength index). If you’re new to Bitcoin (BTC) trading, you may wonder when to buy or sell. Candlestick charts, like bar or line graphs, have time on the horizontal axis, while the price data appears on the vertical axis. They provide a quick look at price movements when compared to other charts. You can quickly view the highest and lowest prices of an asset in a specific timeframe. It also shows the opening and closing prices. Here are a few Bitcoin trading tips to help you get started. No experience needed; this is your go-to crypto candlestick chart tutorial, perfectly suited for beginners.Why analyze Bitcoin price chartsTechnical analysis is an essential and consolidated strategy for trading markets. When Bitcoin (BTC) started picking up and prices fluctuated more, crypto investors began to use trading strategies from traditional markets, such as candlesticks. For Bitcoin technical analysis basics, platforms like TradingView offer many charts and technical indicators. These tools are easy to use, even for beginners. TradingView crypto charts can be candlestick, bar or line charts. Here’s an overview of candlestick charts to help you get started with Bitcoin trading.Beginner’s guide to Bitcoin candlestick chartsCandlestick charts are a milestone in technical analysis and the first step to understanding Bitcoin charts. They are an essential tool to quickly assess price movements and market trends in the short term. They represent Bitcoin’s price trends on a chart over a specific period, such as one hour, four hours or one day, to help traders make better decisions.Why use candlesticks? They help traders visualize price movements over time.They help identify bullish, bearish or consolidation sentiment.They help spot patterns like reversals or continuations to predict future price movements.A candlestick represents four key price points:The opening price at the start of the periodThe closing price at the end of the periodThe highest price reached during the periodThe lowest price reached during the period.A candlestick is formed of a body, the bulky part between the open and close prices. It is green when the price goes up in a bullish move, and the closing price is higher than the opening price. It is red when the closing price is lower than the opening price, so the price is in a bearish movement as it goes down.The body size shows strong buying and selling pressure when it’s long. It indicates uncertainty when it’s short. A candlestick also has wicks, or shadows. They are thin lines above and below the body that indicate the highest or lowest prices the asset hit during the relevant trading frame.Here’s a useful example that may help you understand it better. Suppose you’re analyzing the four-hour chart using candlesticks, and Bitcoin’s opening price is $90,000. The closing price is $93,500, with a high of $95,000 and a low of $88,700. In this instance, the candlestick will appear as a green body from $90,000 to $93,500. An upper wick hitting $95,000 and a lower wick dipping to $88,700.Advantages of Bitcoin candlestick chart Bitcoin candlestick charts offer several advantages, including:Candlestick charts offer you a quick view of market sentiment and price movement. They show if the market is positive or negative and how strong that feeling is. You can pick different timeframes based on your trading style, whether you’re a day trader, swing trader or long-term investor.For example, the one-minute chart works well for scalping, while the daily chart is better for long-term investors. As crypto markets are open 24 hours a day, the open and close prices reflect the start and end of the chosen timeframe.Introduction to advanced crypto charting techniques to trade BTCCandlesticks are a great way to start trading Bitcoin. They give you a quick look at market trends and help predict price movements. Once you know the basic charts and skills, you can explore advanced techniques. For example, using moving averages can help you make better investing decisions.Here are some of the best tools Bitcoin traders use to leverage technical analysis, volume and market psychology. These strategies give traders an edge in the ever-changing crypto market.1. Fibonacci retracement Fibonacci retracement is a technical analysis tool used to spot potential support and resistance levels, as well as price targets. To use this method, draw lines connecting a major high and low on the chart. Then, calculate retracement levels using Fibonacci ratios like 23.6%, 38.2%, 50% and 61.8%. You can use the Fibonacci retracement for confirmation when paired with trendlines or moving averages. 2. Volume profileVolume profile is another tool for technical analysis. It shows trading volume for price instead of time. Knowing where trading happens most helps traders spot key price levels. These levels often create strong support and resistance zones. 3. Elliot Wave TheoryThe Elliott Wave theory is a prediction model of price movements based on market psychology and wave patterns. According to the theory, the market moves in trends of five waves, followed by three waves of correction, with each wave reflecting trader sentiment.4. Other indicatorsThe relative strength index (RSI) is one of the most common charting indicators. It measures the strength of Bitcoin’s upward and downward price movements over time.The simple moving average (SMA) indicates the average price of an asset over time, which can help you understand Bitcoin’s overall price movement. The exponential moving average (EMA) is a better alternative to the SMA for identifying short-term trends. Like the SMA, the EMA shows you the average price of an asset over time, but the EMA focuses more on recent days.Caution! Reading Bitcoin candlesticks or any other charts is a great first step toward understanding market behavior, but remember charts don’t guarantee outcomes. Always combine technical insights with risk management, and never trade more than you can afford to lose.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.
