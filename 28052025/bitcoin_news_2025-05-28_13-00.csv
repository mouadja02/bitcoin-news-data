2025-05-28T10:59:25.000Z,"Leverage Is Heating Up Again Crypto Exchanges - But the Fee Trap Still Catches Most Traders","With markets surging and 50x leverage back on the menu, retail traders are once again piling into high-risk setups on offshore crypto exchanges offering high leverage. But while everyone’s chasing bigger positions, few are stopping to ask: what are the hidden costs? It’s not just the spread anymore. Between overnight fees, taker commissions, and funding rates that shift by the hour, most traders end up paying far more than they think, especially on volatile pairs. As capital flows back into margin products, a silent tax is draining accounts behind the scenes. The platforms don’t highlight it, but the numbers are real. And if you’re not tracking them, your edge is already gone. Why Leverage Trading Is Surging Again Speculation is back — and traders aren’t just buying the dip, they’re borrowing for it. Over the past 20 days, open interest in Bitcoin futures has jumped by 20% , now topping $26 billion across global markets. That’s not idle money, it’s a signal that traders are ramping up margin exposure to chase near-term moves. Bitcoin’s breakout from a falling wedge pattern has reignited bullish momentum, but the real accelerant is leverage. The estimated leverage ratio has climbed nearly 1%, reflecting a wider shift in appetite for risk. This trend isn’t isolated. Liquidity is tightening around key resistance levels, and traders are stacking bets on both sides, hoping to catch a breakout, but sitting inches from liquidation triggers. As Bitcoin has crossed the $100K barrier, the leverage game is officially back on. The Hidden Cost That Most Traders Miss For many retail traders, leverage is a shortcut to bigger positions — but the real cost isn’t always in the loss column. Every time a leveraged position is opened, there are hidden multipliers baked into the transaction: trading fees, overnight interest, and funding rates that quietly erode capital over time. These aren’t hypothetical costs. They compound. What most traders don’t see is easy to highlight by showing how fees can spiral as leverage ratios climb, even when the position is sized modestly. As outlined by Leverage.Trading, which tracks fees across major crypto leverage trading platforms, these costs can spiral quickly with high-margin positions. For example, on a $500 account using 25x leverage, the trading fee alone can spike from $1 to $25, a 2,400% increase, before the trade even moves. Source: fee breakdown via Leverage.Trading What many traders don’t realize is that this fee structure punishes over-leveraging, not just through liquidations, but through slow, cumulative cost drag. That means even when a trade is “profitable,” the net gain may be smaller than expected due to baked-in operational fees. The message? Leverage isn’t free. And figuring out the true cost structure might be the difference between scaling an edge or burning out your capital. From Spot to Futures - Fees Vary More Than You Think It’s easy to assume that a few decimals in trading fees don’t matter—until they do. Spot trading on Binance charges a flat 0.10% for most users, barely dropping unless you're pushing over $20 million in volume. But jump to the futures market, and the dynamic shifts. Suddenly, even modestly active traders can access taker fees as low as 0.045%—half the spot cost. At the highest VIP levels, that gap grows even wider: 0.017% vs. 0.10%. For day traders or anyone using leverage, that’s not a discount. It’s a structural edge. The table below shows just how sharply the fee curve bends. What looks like a small tweak on paper becomes thousands saved—or lost—depending on where you trade. Binance fee tiers spot vs. futures What this means for you. If you're trading with leverage and not checking the fee structure of your platform, you're probably bleeding capital. Let’s say you open 5 trades per day with a 1:25 leverage ratio on a $1,000 account. At a 0.10% fee (typical spot rate), you're paying $125/month in fees. On Binance Futures at 0.045%, that drops to just $56/month, less than half. Over a year? That’s $828 saved, just by choosing the right market. Why Some Traders Don’t Mind Paying More Fees aren’t always the enemy. Power users often trade in milliseconds, not months. For them, paying 0.05% more means accessing deeper liquidity, faster fills, and better outcomes when volatility hits. As one Reddit user put it: “Much more liquid (perpetual futures liquidity is often much better than spot)… really cheap short term, but quite expensive if held too long.”— CrowdGoesWildWoooo, r/CryptoCurrency Others simply prefer tools that keep up with their strategy: Speed > SavingsScalpers and short-term traders will gladly pay higher taker fees to avoid slippage on a fast-moving market. Seconds can make or break a setup. Reliability WinsAfter flash crashes and liquidity gaps, many traders now prioritize exchanges that stay online when volatility hits. “I don’t need the cheapest platform. I need the one that doesn’t freeze,” as one Redditor put it. Infrastructure & ToolingMore expensive platforms often come with better dashboards, charting tools, and automation features — all of which can increase the trader’s edge. Peace of MindAs one user noted: “I’ll probably only use leverage during key moments in the cycle.” For that, they want a platform they trust, not just one that’s cheap. These are real-world trade-offs that numbers alone can’t capture — and they explain why, even in a fee-sensitive niche like crypto, many traders choose to pay more and sleep better. Final Take: Trading Fees Deserve More Attention in 2025 Leverage trading is back in full force, but most traders still aren’t doing the math. While everyone’s fixated on charts, entries, and liquidation points, the slow bleed of fees continues behind the scenes. It’s not just about losses anymore, it’s about how much you don’t make because of what you didn’t see. In 2025, every basis point matters. Whether you're scalping on Binance Futures or riding swing trades offshore, understanding the cost structure of your trades is no longer optional, it's alpha. So before you size up your next position, ask yourself: are you optimizing for the market... or for the platform’s profit margin? Smart traders calculate both.

The MATIC price could reach a maximum of $0.47181 in 2025. POL price with a potential surge may reach a high of $4.94731 by 2030. Polygon (POL) has a mind-blowing Layer-2 scaling solution project for Ethereum, which is primarily designed to address slow speeds and the network’s high transaction fees. As a result, Polygon is seen as a revolutionary framework for developers and users, as it attracts by offering a more efficient Ethereum experience, which is the reason contributing to POL’s price value, too. Through, POL, which is its native token (formerly MATIC), is utilized for transaction fees and network governance, in the framwork of interconnected Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks. Its use case makes it an attractive altcoin, and even its token POL price is attracting attention. The coin is expected to show a surge in the coming sessions, but it would require a technical eye to understand. Therefore, if you are curious about whether the POL price can rebound to $1. Will Polygon go up? And is Polygon a good investment? We bring our Polygon Price Prediction for 2025 – 2030 to explore the POL price prediction. Table of contents Overview Polygon Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Polygon Price Action 2026 POL Price Prediction 2027 Polygon Crypto Price Forecast 2028 MATIC Coin Price Projection 2029 Polygon Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Polygon Token MATIC Price $ 0.21819891 2.88% Market Cap $ 0.00 Trading Volume $ 1,217,344.7306 Circulating Supply 0.00 All-time High $1.29 Mar 14, 2024 All-time Low $0.1533 Apr 07, 2025 Polygon Price Prediction 2025 As evident on the POL/USD daily chart on COINBASE, its price fell in Q1 2025, along with other altcoins in the market, due to trade deal problems in the US. This led investors to refrain from investing in the entire market and watch from the sidelines. However, in Q2 2025’s April month onwards, momentum started as investors got a glimpse of improving geopolitical situations and other positive factors. However, like every other altcoin, POL price action didn’t have a big rise in early May, and it lost its strength early on after reaching $0.269. Even the RSI has slipped below the median line and has taken rejection from the 14-day SMA smoothing line. Despite the loss in momentum, the bears have not been dominant yet, and it is consolidating near the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands. But if it breaks the previous important swing low of $0.20, then bearish forces will take control and push it down to the $0.15 level. However, if the conditions improve, as RSI seems to be cooling down, then the 0.5 Fibonacci level at $0.4572 could act as a magnet for the POL price to rise. This level also aligns with early 2025’s price action-based high-volume profile level. If it successfully clears the $0.4572 level in June, there is a higher chance that the POL price might hit the Fibonacci 0.786 level at $0.6336 and the other at $0.7655 by the end of the year 2025. On the contrary, if the $0.4572 proves to be too strong to break, then there is a strong chance for bears to take over the trend and repel the price from the fibonacci 0.5 level to the lows of 2025.

2025-05-28T10:55:16.000Z,"Bitcoin Is The Golden Standard, According to Trump: What’s the Best New Crypto to Invest In?","US President Donald Trump’s top crypto advisor Bo Hines declared yesterday that ‘Bitcoin is golden standard’ in cryptocurrencies on the first day of the Bitcoin Conference 2025. He added that the US government is looking to acquire as much $BTC as it can get through its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve established in March. And recognizing Bitcoin’s scarcity, Hines said that the Trump administration has no plans of selling any $BTC in its possession. Hines’ statement further cemented Bitcoin’s shift from a speculative investment to a mature one. This can be best seen from the divergence between Bitcoin and the luxury watch industry (a years-long connection since the Pandemic). The first went up while the second dumped . This month, Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $111K before hovering between $108K and $109K in the past few days. All of this paves the way for other top altcoins and meme coins to explode in the coming bull run. Here are a couple with the biggest potential. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Lets You Earn Free $BTC Airdrops First on our list is BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . It’s a project that rallies Bitcoin bulls by giving them free $BTC airdrops when the world-renowned cryptocurrency hits $150K and $200K. To get these free airdrops, you only need to store $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet . You can currently get them via the BTC Bull Token presale page for only $0.002535 each. But with another price increase in two days, it’s to buy $BTCBULL now . The team will also give away free $BTCBULL tokens once $BTC hits $250K. The project’s native token can be an attractive investment because of BTC Bull Token’s potential for growth and the token burns. These burns will happen at $BTC’s $125K, $175K, and $225K price milestones, and should make $BTCBULL more scarce and valuable. Alternatively, you can stake tokens for a 63% APY So far, investors have staked 1.6B $BTCBULL tokens, which further emphasizes everyone’s bullishness on $BTC and $BTC-related projects. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Secure Your Digital Assets with this Up-and-Coming Crypto Wallet Once you own crypto, you should keep it safe, right? In the crypto world, they often say, ‘not your keys, not your coins.’ And it’s true, if you don’t have custody over the private keys, you don’t really own the crypto you bought. That’s where Best Wallet comes in. It’s a non-custodial crypto wallet that gives you control over your private keys for extra security. Through Best Wallet, you can not only buy and store crypto, but also swap coins across blockchains and access some of the best new crypto coins. And powering this entire ecosystem is the native Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , which gives you exclusive perks like lower transaction fees, higher staking rewards, and early access to presales. $BEST is currently priced at $0.025095 on the Best Wallet Token presale page . To buy tokens, simply connect your crypto wallet (Best Wallet is preferred, naturally) to the presale widget, enter the number of tokens you want to buy, and pay with your credit/debit card or crypto. Our Best Wallet Token buying guide gives you step-by-step instructions on getting $BEST. We estimate $BEST to reach $0.62 by the end of the year , which is a 2,370% increase from the current price. Simply put, $500 today could turn to $12,350 in a year’s time, all while waiting. And that’s not counting all the $BTC airdrops if Bitcoin continues the bull run. Not a bad deal, right? 3. Bitcoin Pepe ($BPEP) – Unlocking Bitcoin’s Meme Coin Potential With the rise in meme coins’ popularity , comes the need to deliver speed and security in every meme coin transaction. That’s where Bitcoin Pepe ($BPEP) comes in. This project delivers a Layer 2 blockchain that combines Solana’s speed and low transaction fees with the security of Bitcoin. Through its ecosystem, anyone will be able to launch their tokens directly on Bitcoin. Critical to this is its Bitcoin Pepe Bridge, which allows $BTC holders to move their crypto to the Bitcoin Pepe Layer 2. This will let users use their $BTC for more than just a store-of-value. We’re talking exponential returns that we’ve come to expect from the best meme coins . You can already invest in this project by joining its token presale, which ends in three days. This means it’s your last chance to buy $BPEP, which currently costs $0.0377. Once the presale is over, the token will be listed on major centralized exchanges, which should drive up its price further. There’s No Stopping the Rise of Bitcoin and New Cryptocurrencies As Bitcoin becomes mainstream and reaches new highs, other cryptocurrencies are jockeying for the position of being the ‘next big thing’ in the market. But whatever crypto you choose to invest in—be it BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) , Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , or something else altogether, their potential surge can no longer be ignored. And when it comes to investing in crypto, remember to always do your own research.

2025-05-28T10:54:48.000Z,"Beyond Bitcoin: Charting blockchain’s evolution to mainstream utility","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. From buying pizza to powering global finance, blockchain’s journey from obscure tech to real-world utility has only just begun. Table of Contents A pizza purchase changes the course of Bitcoin, blockchain history From abstract tech to tangible real-world solutions Blockchain’s unfolding utility It’s pretty wild to think that the tech that underpins the entire crypto industry really started as just that, an underpinning. Blockchain, the DLT that breathed life into cryptocurrencies, was, for a long time, almost exclusively talked about in the same breath as Bitcoin ( BTC ). For many, it was a bit of an obscure concept, a niche novelty that powered a new kind of digital cash. Wind the clock forward to today, and blockchain’s story is one of absolutely incredible expansion. It’s shot far beyond its first job, now forming the foundational layer for a massive, sprawling ecosystem of dApps, composable DeFi protocols, smart contracts, and millions of unique tokens, all trying to solve different real-world problems. Bitcoin, no doubt, was the first big real-world application of blockchain, an impactful demonstration of peer-to-peer digital cash. But that was just the opening scene. The real genius was in the core innovation: a secure, decentralized, transparent, and immutable way to record and verify transactions without needing middlemen. This idea proved to be incredibly flexible. As Binance CEO Richard Teng discussed during the CEO Connect; May Edition talk , what kicked off with that first, almost experimental, crypto purchase has paved the way for serious payment systems, utility-rich stablecoins, and a whole host of tangible, real-world applications. “Fifteen years ago, crypto was about buying a pizza. Today, it’s about building robust payment systems, stablecoins, and real-life use cases that change lives,” said Teng. A pizza purchase changes the course of Bitcoin, blockchain history That almost mythical tale of Laszlo Hanyecz and his two Papa John’s pizzas is much more than just a fun bit of crypto trivia. It was a genuine turning point for both Bitcoin and the blockchain technology it’s built on. When Hanyecz successfully paid 10,000 BTC for those pizzas on May 22, 2010, it wasn’t just about proving Bitcoin could buy him dinner. Fundamentally, it was the first widely recognized, real-world stress test. It showed that the blockchain could actually work as a functional ledger for transferring value. Before this pizza deal, Bitcoin and its blockchain were, for most people, pretty abstract ideas, confined to online forums and the hard drives of a few early tech pioneers. Hanyecz’s purchase gave us solid proof that blocks could be made, transactions could be checked by the network, and ownership of digital value could be passed on for good, resulting in actual, physical stuff. This single act yanked blockchain out of the purely theoretical and into the world of practical use. That one transaction lit a fire under countless developers and entrepreneurs. If blockchain and Bitcoin could handle buying pizzas, what else could they be used for? It showcased the core benefits of a decentralized, trustless ledger and a decentralized, community-governed cryptocurrency. It set the stage for people to explore their potential far beyond just being a new form of money, changing the course of tech history in the process. You might also like: Dorsey’s Block to enable Bitcoin payments for nearly 4m Square merchants by 2026 From abstract tech to tangible real-world solutions The journey from that first pizza buy to today’s thriving blockchain market has been nothing short of phenomenal. Today the crypto ecosystem is focused on the utility of robust payment systems. We’ve got Layer 1 blockchains built for different purposes, some are focusing on throughput, others on security and decentralization. And let’s not forget Layer 2 solutions like rollups and state channels that are built on top of these chains to scale them and slash gas fees on networks like Ethereum and Bitcoin. Stablecoins, a direct spin-off of blockchain innovation, have become a vital part of the digital asset economy. They give us a reliable way to transact and store value, pegged to fiat currencies, and they’re essential for seamless trading, powering DeFi protocols and dApps, and are increasingly used for remittances and everyday shopping, dodging the wild price swings of other cryptos. This utility is a world away from the experimental feel of those early Bitcoin deals. With institutional investors holding 12.82% of the total BTC supply and the US government accumulating Bitcoin as part of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve set up in March, Bitcoin and blockchain are not some fringe tech anymore. They are being actively integrated into the treasuries of major financial players and considered at the national level. But everyday use cases are probably the most powerful proof of the transformation of blockchain and Bitcoin. Binance recently asked its users to share how crypto has actually been useful in their own lives . Forget the memes for a second; these stories paint a picture of cryptocurrencies solving everyday problems and creating meaningful moments, showing the practical side that Bitcoin Pizza Day first hinted at. Take Andy from Vietnam, for example. He ran into a common travel snag in Malaysia: needing to pay a rental deposit without a local bank account. His plan B was crypto. “I turned to crypto and planned to use Binance to make the payment,” he shared. As it turned out, the host ended up waiving the fee because Andy promised to take good care of the place. “While the payment was never completed,” Andy reflected, “it was still a perfect example of how versatile crypto can be in real-life situations!” In a second example, Binance Angel @Gerrit92 got into crypto back in 2019. Through patient “buying and HODLing,” Gerrit92 built a small fortune. To celebrate, he cashed out some of his profits, using them to buy a Rolex. Besides fulfilling a long-held desire to own this valuable watch, the Rolex to this user also serves as a token of the friends and profits he has made via crypto. @Gerrit92 explains, “I’ve been investing in crypto since 2019 and have never cashed out a large amount. I traded occasionally to rebalance my portfolio, but I always believed in a long-term vision. After many years in crypto, I decided to take a small portion of my profits to invest in another asset, fulfilling a childhood dream with a valuable purchase, a Rolex. It may be less volatile, but I look at it every day, and it reminds me of crypto and the friends I’ve made in this community.” These personal stories really show how blockchain tech is quietly becoming part of our daily financial lives. As Teng also said, “It’s no longer just about a pizza. It’s about how crypto performs in the real world and how blockchain can change lives.” Blockchain’s unfolding utility From its debut as Bitcoin’s backbone to its current role powering tens of thousands of dApps and protocols, blockchain technology has decisively transitioned from a niche novelty to a versatile tool with profound everyday utility. The journey, sparked by simple yet impactful acts like Hanyecz’s pizza purchase, continues to unfold. It promises even more innovations in areas like decentralized identity, making supply chains more transparent, tokenizing RWAs, strengthening physical infrastructure with DePIN, and countless other sectors. Blockchain’s core strengths, security, transparency, and decentralization, are proving to be a potent mix for reshaping not just finance but the very way we transact in the digital age.

2025-05-28T10:54:01.000Z,"US SEC Commences First Formal Review of Spot XRP ETF","The possibility of trading spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States just went a notch higher. This is because the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) just commenced its first formal review of an application seeking to launch an XRP ETF in the country. According to a filing from the securities agency, it has initiated proceedings to determine whether it will approve or deny an application to list and trade shares of the WisdomTree XRP ETF on the Cboe BZX Exchange. WisdomTree is an asset management firm that issued one of the eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. SEC to Review WisdomTree Spot XRP ETF The SEC is evaluating whether the proposed rule change to list WisdomTree’s XRP ETF on Cboe BZX is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative practices. The proposal must implement measures that protect investors and serve the public interest before it can be considered for approval. Additionally, the SEC noted that the proposal may raise new concerns not previously considered by the agency, and these issues need to be addressed. While the proceedings continue, the Commission has asked interested persons to submit their views regarding the approval or disapproval of the application. “The Commission asks that commenters address the sufficiency of the Exchange’s statements in support of the proposal, which are set forth in the Notice, in addition to any other comments they may wish to submit about the proposed rule change,” the SEC stated. Notably, the initiation of proceedings for the proposal does not guarantee that the SEC will approve the product. The agency has roughly 240 days to decide whether the proposal is worth approving or not. Not the First It is also worth mentioning that the WisdomTree ETF, if approved, will not be the first XRP fund to be listed in the U.S. Early last month, the Vermont-based asset manager Teucrium launched the first leveraged XRP ETF in the U.S. on NYSE Arca. Towards the end of the month, the fund management company ProShares listed three futures ETFs. The funds provide investors with leveraged and inverse exposure to XRP through derivatives. The SEC approval of a spot XRP ETF would pave the way for the launch of similar products.

2025-05-28T10:46:36.000Z,"Why is Bitcoin price stuck?","Key points: Bitcoin price is stuck in a range, with overhead resistance at $110,000 continuing to obstruct a rally to new all-time highs. Traders are in a wait-and-see mood due to uncertainty surrounding macroeconomic events. Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) bull run has stalled, with the price consolidating within a roughly $3,500 range since May 23. The $110,000 level proves to be a stubborn barrier. BTC/USD four-hour chart. Cointelegraph/ TradingView Let’s look at some of the reasons why Bitcoin price remains stuck. Bitcoin runs into resistance at $110,000 Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and Bitstamp shows that BTC price oscillates within a tight range between $106,600 and $110,700, with no clear directional bias. BTC price has “broken out of the triangle pattern and is moving upward,” but a key resistance level is at $110,000, said analyst and trader BitMonty in his latest Bitcoin analysis on X. Over the past few days, Bitcoin bulls have made two unsuccessful attempts to break above the resistance at $110,000. The trader pointed out that a breakout above this level could propel BTC to new all-time highs. “However, if the price is rejected at this level, it may retreat toward the support area.” BTC/USD hourly chart. Source: BitMonty For market intelligence firm Santiment, failure to grow past the $110,000 level has led to waning enthusiasm among traders. Traders are showing a bit of FOMO as Bitcoin’s price ranges around $110,000, but the “euphoria has calmed down a bit,” the firm explained in an X post, adding: “With markets moving in the opposite direction of retailers’ expectations, we may continue to see some reasonable doubt.” Bitcoin positive vs. negative commentary ratio on social media. Source: Santiment Bitcoin cools amid macroeconomic uncertainty This week’s macroeconomic events add doubt and hesitation to the crypto market while rising bond yields are causing concern. The release of the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting minutes is a focal point as investors seek clues about future interest rate decisions. On May 7, the US Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged , with Chair Jerome Powell citing President Donald Trump’s tariff measures as a source of inflation and uncertainty. This week, the April Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index print and initial jobless claims are due on May 29. These will follow the first revision of Q1 GDP. Meanwhile, AI giant Nvidia’s earnings report could move tech markets, indirectly affecting cryptocurrencies. A disappointing report could trigger broader market sell-offs, further pressuring Bitcoin. Moreover, the ongoing 2025 Bitcoin conference in Las Vegas features speeches from Trump family members, whose past appearances have triggered sharp market movements. “Last July’s Nashville keynote by Trump coincided with a sharp spike in 1-day implied vols above 90, followed by a swift reversal and a nearly 30% decline in BTC within two days. That episode continues to shape market memory,” said trading firm QCP Capital in a May 27 Telegram note to investors, adding: “While the probability of a similar drawdown appears low, positioning suggests a defensive tilt.” Bitcoin bulls fight to hold key support levels Meanwhile, popular trader Daan Crypto Trades said that the “longer price hovers around” the $110,000 region, the thicker the liquidity clusters above and below will become. “There’s a big liquidity cluster down at $106K and quite a few sitting from $111K and up,” part of his X post said . “The main level to look out for would be the all-time highs above $111,000 and below, all the way down to $105,000, which was the start of the recent move.” Daan Crypto Trades added: “Keep an eye out for when price taps either of these regions as those usually act as a magnet when price is close.” BTC/USDT liquidation heatmap.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency with the largest market dominance, It has created history all over the world with its strong adoption. It has played a significant role in revolutionizing the financial system, which was previously dominated by centralized power; it changed when Bitcoin price started climbing the ladder. The BTC price is expected to display strong numbers in the long term and in the short term, as well.

The BTC price may range between $108,342.54 and $110,744.21 today. Table of Contents Story Highlights Bitcoin Price Today CoinPedia’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 Bitcoin Crypto Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 BTC Price Forecast 2026 BTC Price Prediction 2027 Bitcoin Predictions 2028 BTC Price 2029 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2030 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Bitcoin Prediction: Analysts and Influencer’s BTC Price Target FAQs Bitcoin Price Today Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Token BTC Price $ 108,895.05864349 -0.74% Market cap $ 2,163,854,690,360.40 Circulating Supply 19,871,009.00 Trading Volume $ 52,002,700,524.1643 All-time high $109,114.88 on 20th January 2025 All-time low $0.04865 on 15th July 2010 CoinPedia’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Firstly, at CoinPedia, we feel optimistic about Bitcoin’s price increase. Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 In May 2025, Bitcoin’s unstoppable ascent showed a nice and steady rise. This recovery was possible due to easing tensions from the trade tariffs war, which led BTC to surge to a new all-time high of $112K. The price fell back recently as a post by Donald Trump brought back the trade tensions with european union this time, which led to a brief dip to $108K. But, 48 hours later he paused the recent impose with EU until June 9th. However, it seemed like BTC was gonna take a huge blow once again, but after the pause was announced, positivity and bullish narratives quickly returned to the table from crypto traders. Now, in the past couple of days, it’s heading back to its all-time high level, and it seems like it is setting the stage for what could be the most significant leg of the 2025 rally. Also, the Market sentiment has shifted from pessimistic to optimistic. The BTC long/short ratio currently stands at 1.0708, which has recovered from 0.9391, indicating that bulls have recovered. This shows that bearish forces have halted the momentum in the short term, but bulls are not on the sidelines; they are kicking in to push the price higher. If bearishness wanes, then the newly formed all-time high must be taken out; once BTC flips, it will enter price discovery mode. In that condition, BTC is eyeing a near-term target of $120,000, with the potential for even higher levels in the coming months. However, if bulls fail to flip $112K and a failure to reach the short-term target is witnessed, then BTC could easily trigger a pullback to $100,000 or lower. Supporting this cautious view, on-chain data reveals that a substantial amount of dormant Bitcoin, unmoved for 2 to 3 years, and 3years to 5 years has recently become active. This kind of movement is often interpreted as a bearish signal, suggesting that long-term holders might be preparing to sell. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 A key factor driving the potential for higher Bitcoin prices is the relationship with global liquidity. Historical trends reveal that as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences dramatic price surges. Now, with global liquidity beginning to rise again after a prolonged period of stagnation, the stage seems set for another major rally in Bitcoin’s value. This shift in liquidity could create the perfect environment for Bitcoin to soar once more. Also, cryptoquant data suggest that accumulation is on top with exchange reserve declining at more alarming rates. When writing 2.4 Milliion BTC were in total on the exchange reserves, which is a strong decline from a year ago when reserves were 3.1 Million BTC.

2025-05-28T10:45:52.000Z,"UFC Legend Conor McGregor Wants to Know about XRP","Crypto influencer Amelie (@_Crypto_Barbie) recently brought attention to a significant moment for XRP. She shared an image showing UFC legend and five-time world champion Conor McGregor questioning claims that Bitcoin and Ethereum are the only centralized blockchains. He specifically mentioned the U.S. government’s interest in acquiring XRP, SOL, and ADA. Amelie noted that XRP is now getting the recognition it deserves. This reflects a broader sentiment that XRP is finally moving toward mainstream legitimacy. This development comes on the heels of Donald Trump’s announcement of a strategic crypto reserve including BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, and ADA. This move marked a notable shift from the anti-crypto stance of the previous administration, and it is part of a broader strategy to make the United States “the Crypto Capital of the World.” BREAKING NEWS: UFC LEGEND & 5 TIME WORLD CHAMPION CONOR MCGREGOR WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT #XRP pic.twitter.com/QJEOeJ5V4h — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) May 26, 2025 McGregor Questions Blockchain Narratives Conor McGregor’s social media post revealed his growing awareness of the complexities surrounding blockchain decentralization. Maximalists have falsely claimed for years that XRP is centralized. These falsehoods have been debunked on numerous occasions by Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO), David Schwartz, and many other crypto experts. McGregor raised a critical point by asking why the U.S. government would consider XRP, SOL, and ADA for its strategic reserve if Bitcoin and Ethereum were the only truly decentralized cryptocurrencies. McGregor’s comments show that a little curiosity can dispel these false claims spread by maximalists. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP, in particular, has faced opposition for years, with many Bitcoin proponents attempting to discredit it while ignoring its advantages. However, even XRP haters can see its true potential, as Davinci Jeremie, a well-known Bitcoin advocate, recently predicted that XRP could climb to $24 in 2025 . XRP’s Growing Recognition XRP has long positioned itself as a cross-border settlement solution with institutional appeal, aligning with strategic interests like those mentioned in Trump’s statement. As a result of this unique design and its many advantages over other assets, XRP has seen a significant increase in adoption in 2025. Amelie’s observation reflects what many XRP holders have anticipated for years: that institutional interest and mainstream recognition could drive XRP into a central role in the evolving financial system. McGregor’s recognition is just a small part of the asset’s growing mainstream popularity , and it’s only a matter of time before this recognition is reflected in its price.

2025-05-28T10:43:45.000Z,"Strategy: Hate Or Love Bitcoin, Preferreds Are Still Getting A High Yield","Summary Strategy's fixed-income securities offer investors an income-based way to gain exposure to Bitcoin. STRK and STRF have substantially different clauses that align them with different types of investors. Both preferreds are currently swapping hands at small premiums to their $100 per share liquidation value. STRK's convertible feature exposes its holders to more MSTR volatility versus STRF. MicroStrategy ( MSTR ), renamed Strategy, has two outstanding preferreds that offer income investors dividend yields that seemingly more than compensate for the risk posed by the $102 billion market cap Bitcoin (\""BTC\"") holding company. MicroStrategy 8.00% Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock ( STRK ) and MicroStrategy 10.00% Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock ( STRF ) both offer alternative investment methods versus the commons as MSTR continues its aggressive BTC accumulation strategy, built on near-weekly buys of the cryptocurrency. This is backed by a sustained, material, and Sisyphean capital-raising effort from a perpetual at-the-market common stock offering program, padded by the sale of preferreds and the issue of convertible debt. MSTR most recently bought 4,020 BTC and now holds 580,250 BTC as of the 26th of May. This would mean a roughly $63.4 billion value on its holdings, with BTC currently trading for $109,301 and with an average purchase price of $69,979 . Strategy Fiscal 2025 First Quarter Form 10-Q These preferreds are relatively young. STRK started trading in January, with STRF going public two months later. Critically, both securities offer an income-based way to gain exposure to BTC. MSTR filed to sell up to $21 billion of its common shares in May; these stock sales are being completed, with the common shares trading at a significant premium to the underlying value of the company's BTC holdings. These equity sales form the primary way the company meets its coupon payments to the preferred holders. Data by YCharts The premium essentially provides MSTR with a blank check to continue to acquire BTC at a level that's incredibly accretive to its balance sheet. However, this position is only maintained in a BTC bull market, as the company does not generate sufficient cash flows from its enterprise analytics software platform to buy BTC. This platform is MSTR's only reportable operating segment, generating fiscal 2025 first-quarter revenue of $111.06 million . This underperformed consensus estimates and also dipped 3.6% over the year-ago period. The software business is immaterial to the bull case, generating a negative operating cash flow of $2.4 million during the first quarter. Data by YCharts The Risk And Opportunity Of The Preferreds Data by YCharts While MSTR can be seen as a proxy for owning BTC directly, the strong premium to BTC means it has built a large short interest, with roughly 11% of its common shares outstanding sold short. The company is a levered play on BTC; hence, the commons tend to outperform in BTC bull markets. MSTR's commons are up 120% over the last 1-year, versus a BTC performance of 57%. The inverse is true, with MSTR underperforming BTC during BTC bear markets. MSTR's full fiscal year 2025 guidance for its BTC yield, the percentage change in Bitcoin per share, was raised to 25% from an initial 15% floor, with the company also aiming to now gain $15 billion in BTC. Security Current Price To Liquidation Value ($100) Annual Coupon And Yield MicroStrategy 8.00% Series A Cumulative Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock ( STRK ) $100.99 (+0.99%) $8 (7.92%) MicroStrategy 10.00% Series A Cumulative Perpetual Strike Preferred Stock ( STRF ) $100.15 (+0.15%) $10 (9.98%) Both preferreds have a $100 per share liquidation value, with STRF offering a yield on cost that at 9.98% is around 206 basis points above STRK. STRF also trades on a slightly smaller premium to its liquidation value of 0.15% versus a premium of nearly 1% for STRK. The core difference between these perpetual preferreds with no call date is that STRK has a convertible feature. Holders of STRK have the right to convert their shares on any business day into common shares. This is at an initial conversion rate of 0.10 shares of the common stock per share of STRK. MicroStrategy 8.00% Series A Perpetual Strike Preferred IPO Prospectus This essentially creates direct exposure to MSTR's volatility as it provides an embedded call option. STRK would have an embedded value of $54.30 per preferred share if MSTR, currently trading for $370 per share, were to trade up back to its 52-week high of $543 per share. Hence, investors are willing to accept a marginally higher premium and a lower yield to gain access to the MSTR call option. It also means STRK will be significantly more volatile with the preferreds up 24.68% year-to-date, nearly matching the commons, versus a performance of 10.97% of STRF. Seeking Alpha This has opened up a dichotomy for the securities where STRF will likely outperform STRK in an event where BTC and MSTR are dipping lower and investors would prefer the stability it provides. The inverse is true with STRK set to continue to outperform in bull markets. MSTR issues a bunch of extremely cheap convertible debt. This totalled $8.14 billion as of the end of its first quarter, up sequentially from $7.1 billion as of the end of December. The company is paying just $14.68 million in quarterly interest for this debt balance, with the prior junk \"" B- \"" credit rating from S&P Global withdrawn as of December. Cbonds Strategy Fiscal 2025 First Quarter Form 10-Q Prospective investors in either preferreds should be aware that MSTR is simply unable to fund its interest payments without selling more shares of its common stock or more preferreds. This opens up a worst-case scenario where a collapsing BTC and common share price inhibits the company's ability to execute its BTC buying program, which could spark a suspension of coupon payments to shareholders or payment in common shares in lieu of cash for STRK. The company can only pay in cash coupons to STRF holders. Both preferreds are cumulative, but STRF has a unique escalating clause that any unpaid dividend will itself accrue dividends by an extra 100 basis points each subsequent quarter of missed payments up to a ceiling of 18% per year. This ramps up their inherent stability versus STRK. I would not initiate a position in either due to the current premium to liquidation value with a possible pullback in BTC, currently trading at highs, ramping up near-term risk. All MSTR securities are being rated as a hold.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4790394-strategy-hate-or-love-bitcoin-preferreds-are-still-getting-a-high-yield?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|STRK","MSTR|STRK|STRF",cryptocompare

Robert Mitchnick, while comparing Bitcoin to gold, said that BTC offers much higher upside potential and lower downside potential than gold. Despite this comparison, Mitchnick noted that Bitcoin and gold do not necessarily compete. Mitchnick said that both assets are strong assets that serve a similar purpose, helping investors protect against traditional financial risks. Stating that Bitcoin has solidified its place as a mainstream investment asset, the BlackRock executive argued that 2 percent of investment portfolios should be allocated to Bitcoin. “Bitcoin and gold essentially serve the same purpose. I see BTC and gold as different aspects of a similar theme, and I believe that both are scarce, decentralized, and not controlled by governments. But I think Bitcoin offers much higher upside potential and lower downside potential than gold.” The BlackRock executive recently highlighted Bitcoin’s modern advantages. Unlike gold, Bitcoin can be moved around the world instantly at almost zero cost. According to Mitchnick, these features make Bitcoin attractive to both retail and institutional investors looking for strong alternatives to traditional safe haven assets. “Because of these features, Bitcoin has started to gain more space in investment portfolios. Because investors now prefer a 50 percent gold – 50 percent Bitcoin ratio.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: BlackRock's Cryptocurrency Manager Talked About Bitcoin (BTC) and Gold!

2025-05-28T10:32:14.000Z,"AMINA Bank hits $40M revenue in 2024 as crypto AUM doubles","Swiss crypto bank AMINA Bank AG, formerly SEBA Bank AG, reported record financial results for 2024, with revenue climbing 69% year-over-year to $40.4 million. The bank also saw its assets under management (AUM) rise by 136% to $4.2 billion, driven by institutional demand and strategic expansion, according to a May 28 news release . The Zurich-based bank credited the growth to its multi-jurisdictional footprint, 24/7 trading capabilities and a lending book that has maintained zero defaults over five years. “I’m incredibly proud of our team’s tenacity and focus, which led to quarterly profitability in Q4 2024, a pivotal milestone that confirms the value of our approach,” CEO Franz Bergmueller said. Related: Bitcoin Suisse eyes UAE expansion with regulatory nod in Abu Dhabi AMINA adds $801M in assets in 2024 During the year, AMINA added $801 million in net new assets. Revenue from derivatives increased by 40%, reflecting increased interest from clients seeking crypto-based risk-management tools. The bank also said it invested in building a proprietary digital platform last year, aiming to serve business-to-consumer (B2C), business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-business-to-consumer (B2B2C) clients. The system, expected to launch later this year, will feature API-based infrastructure to handle increasing demand across markets. Mike Foy, chief financial officer at AMINA Bank, said the bank’s liquidity coverage ratio increased to 228% in 2024, up from 219% in 2023. “In addition, our CET1 capital ratio, which compares a bank’s capital against its risk-weighted assets, is more than double the regulatory requirement at 34%, despite an increase in risk-weighted assets as a result of our expansion,” Foy added. Related: Crypto projects prepare to battle for privacy in Switzerland AMINA’s international revenue grows AMINA also noted that its international revenue continues to increase, with income from its Abu Dhabi operations rising 150% year-over-year and Hong Kong posting 570% growth. The bank expects to onboard 30 B2B2C partners by the end of 2025, up from almost 20. Founded in 2019, AMINA holds licenses from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), Abu Dhabi’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) and Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC). AMINA rebranded from SEBA Bank on Dec. 1, 2023, to highlight its shift toward integrating traditional finance with digital and crypto services. In November 2023, Switzerland’s St.Galler Kantonalbank, one of the largest banks in the country, partnered with then-branded SEBA to offer its clients digital asset custody and brokerage services.

2025-05-28T10:30:58.000Z,"Brian Quintenz, Trump’s CFTC Nominee, Reveals $3.4M Assets and Extensive Crypto Ties","BitcoinWorld Brian Quintenz, Trump’s CFTC Nominee, Reveals $3.4M Assets and Extensive Crypto Ties The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, and the people shaping its future through regulation are under increasing scrutiny. Recent news surrounding Brian Quintenz , nominated by former President Donald Trump to potentially lead the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), highlights the intersection of traditional finance, political appointments, and the burgeoning digital asset space. His recent Financial disclosure has revealed significant personal assets and deep connections within the crypto industry, raising important questions about potential conflicts of interest and the future direction of Crypto regulation under his potential leadership. Who is Brian Quintenz and Why Does His Nomination Matter? Brian Quintenz is no stranger to the regulatory landscape. He previously served as a CFTC commissioner from 2017 to 2021. During his tenure, he was often seen as a voice advocating for clarity and sensible approaches to regulating digital assets. His return to the CFTC, this time potentially as its head, would place him in a powerful position to influence how cryptocurrencies, derivatives, and related markets are overseen in the United States. The CFTC plays a crucial role in the crypto ecosystem. It has asserted jurisdiction over certain digital assets deemed commodities, such as Bitcoin and Ether. The agency is responsible for preventing manipulation and fraud in commodity markets, which increasingly includes crypto derivatives like futures and swaps. Therefore, the stance and background of the CFTC chairperson have significant implications for market participants, innovators, and investors alike. Brian Quintenz’s Financial Disclosure: What Did It Reveal? According to reports from Cointelegraph, citing Bloomberg, Brian Quintenz ‘s financial disclosure filing indicates holdings valued at a minimum of $3.4 million. While this figure represents a snapshot of his assets, the breakdown of these holdings provides key insights into his financial interests, particularly his ties to the technology and crypto investment sectors. Key points from the disclosure include: Minimum Asset Value: At least $3.4 million. Investment Vehicles: Significant stakes in multiple investment funds managed by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), a prominent venture capital firm heavily invested in crypto and web3 technologies. Direct Company Ties: Equity and unvested stock options in Kalshi, a U.S.-based prediction market platform. This level of detail in a financial disclosure is standard for high-level government nominees, intended to provide transparency and identify potential conflicts of interest that might arise if confirmed for the position. Deep Ties to Andreessen Horowitz and the Crypto Space Perhaps the most notable aspect of Brian Quintenz ‘s disclosure, from a crypto perspective, is his current role and investments related to Andreessen Horowitz . Since leaving his CFTC commissioner post in 2021, Quintenz has served as the global head of crypto policy at a16z. This position involves engaging with policymakers and regulators worldwide to advocate for policies favorable to the growth and development of the crypto and web3 industries. His investments in a16z’s investment vehicles further solidify this connection. The disclosure specifically mentions stakes in three funds: CNK Fund III CNK Seed 1 Fund CNK IV Fund Andreessen Horowitz has been one of the most active and influential investors in the crypto space, backing numerous startups across various sectors, including decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, infrastructure, and exchanges. Quintenz’s role and investments place him squarely within the core of the crypto investment ecosystem, providing him with unique insights but also potentially creating perceived conflicts of interest should he be tasked with regulating firms or technologies in which a16z (and by extension, he) has a financial stake. Involvement with Kalshi: A Prediction Market Platform Beyond his role at a16z, Brian Quintenz ‘s disclosure also reveals his involvement with Kalshi. He serves on the board of directors for the prediction market platform and holds both equity and unvested stock options in the company. Kalshi allows users to trade on the outcome of future events, ranging from economic indicators to weather patterns. Prediction markets have sometimes touched upon areas that could fall under regulatory purview, depending on how they are structured and the underlying events being traded. His direct financial interest and board membership at Kalshi add another layer to his complex relationship with potentially regulated entities within the broader digital and event-based trading markets. Implications for Crypto Regulation The nomination of someone with such extensive and recent ties to the crypto industry, coupled with significant financial holdings in related ventures, sparks considerable debate regarding Crypto regulation . On one hand, proponents might argue that Quintenz’s deep understanding of the technology and market dynamics, gained through his work at a16z and involvement with companies like Kalshi, makes him uniquely qualified to craft effective and informed regulations. They might see his background as a benefit, ensuring that rules are practical and don’t stifle innovation. On the other hand, critics may express concerns about potential conflicts of interest. They might worry that his past and present financial interests could influence his regulatory decisions, potentially favoring the companies or sectors in which he or his former employer have invested. Navigating these potential conflicts, should he be confirmed, will be a critical challenge for Brian Quintenz . The confirmation process will likely involve scrutiny of these ties and assets by the relevant Senate committee. Quintenz would need to demonstrate how he intends to manage any potential conflicts, which could involve recusal from certain matters or other ethics arrangements. The Path Forward for the CFTC Nominee Brian Quintenz’s nomination represents a pivotal moment for the future of Crypto regulation in the U.S. His background offers a blend of regulatory experience and deep industry knowledge. However, his substantial Financial disclosure and extensive ties to major players like Andreessen Horowitz and Kalshi mean his confirmation process will be closely watched. Market participants, policymakers, and the public will be keen to understand how Quintenz plans to balance his past industry affiliations with the public interest responsibilities of leading a key financial regulator like the CFTC. The outcome of his nomination will undoubtedly have a lasting impact on how digital assets are regulated in the years to come.

2025-05-28T10:25:21.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: May Rally and Lark Davis’s Take on Market Top Signals","The post Bitcoin Price Analysis: May Rally and Lark Davis’s Take on Market Top Signals appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin continues to capture investor attention as it navigates a critical phase in its price cycle. Entrepreneur and well-known Crypto Analyst Lark Davis recently shared his perspective on whether the market is nearing its peak or still has room to run. Bitcoin’s May Performance and Current Price Overview Starting May at approximately $94,146, Bitcoin’s price surged impressively throughout the month. By May 22, the cryptocurrency reached a new high near $111,970 , marking an 18.66% increase within just three weeks. Although the market experienced a slight correction of about 3.9% on May 23, bullish momentum quickly resumed, pushing the price back up by over 1.5% the following day. As of now, Bitcoin’s price stands at around $108,789—roughly 2.8% below its all-time high. This steady price action reflects ongoing investor interest and a cautiously optimistic market sentiment. Insights from Lark Davis on Market Top Signals In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Lark Davis challenged the common narrative that Bitcoin’s rally is at its end. He referenced the Net Realised Profit and Loss (NPL) indicator to support his view that the market still holds significant upside potential. The NPL indicator tracks the average paper profit across Bitcoin holders. When the value is strongly positive, it often signals that many investors have realized profits, sometimes preceding market corrections. However, Davis noted that this indicator is not currently at peak levels, suggesting that widespread profit-taking has yet to occur. This analysis implies that while Bitcoin has rallied significantly, many holders are still in profit but have not rushed to sell, a condition that can support further price appreciation. Source: Lark Davis X Post .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Robert Kiyosaki Warns of ‘Greater Depression’, Predicts Bitcoin to $1 Million , Understanding the Net Unrealised Profit/Loss Indicator To clarify, the Net Unrealised Profit/Loss (NUPL) metric measures how much profit or loss investors hold on paper without having sold. A positive reading indicates collective profitability among holders, while a negative value points to unrealized losses. On May 5, the NUPL was at 52.78%. When Bitcoin reached its peak price recently, the indicator rose to approximately 58.7%. These values, though elevated, have not yet reached extreme levels historically associated with market tops. This aligns with Davis’s view that the rally may still have room to grow before a potential correction. Balanced Perspective and Market Caution While Lark Davis provides an optimistic take, it is important for investors to maintain a balanced perspective. Cryptocurrency markets remain volatile and subject to rapid changes based on external factors such as regulatory developments, macroeconomic conditions, and broader market sentiment. Monitoring key technical indicators like the NPL and NUPL, alongside fundamental factors, can offer valuable insights for making informed investment decisions. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

NUPL indicates collective paper profits/losses. Bitcoin’s NUPL is elevated but not at historical extreme levels for a market top. Is it worth investing in Bitcoin right now? Bitcoin is highly volatile. While current sentiment is cautiously optimistic, invest only what you can afford to lose and consider long-term goals. How high can Bitcoin price go in 2025? Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by year-end 2025, driven by ETF inflows and supply tightening, though predictions vary.

2025-05-28T10:21:09.000Z,"Bitcoin’s golden cross confirmed; Here’s the next record high target","Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) recent momentum could lead to gains of over 50%, following the confirmation of a bullish golden cross technical formation. According to an analysis by TradingShot , the golden cross emerged as Bitcoin formed the fourth bullish leg within a long-term “channel up” pattern that began after the November 2022 bottom. In a May 28 post on X, the analyst pointed out that this channel has reliably guided Bitcoin’s price through multiple consolidation phases, often around the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level, before each breakout. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView A golden cross typically occurs when the 50-day moving average ( MA ) crosses above the 200-day (MA). At the same time, Bitcoin’s weekly MACD has printed a bullish cross, further supporting the upward trend. Bitcoin’s next record high price target Historically, these indicators have preceded significant rallies, and the current market structure shows strong similarities. Bitcoin remains within its upward channel and appears to have room to move higher. Based on Fibonacci extension levels and the prevailing bullish pattern, TradingShot projects Bitcoin could climb to as high as $165,000, a potential 51% increase from its current price near $109,000.

In a separate May 28 X post , the analyst noted that this development is especially notable, as similar signals haven’t yet appeared in major stock indices. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: SmartReversals The upper Bollinger Band (BB), which previously widened during periods of consolidation, has started to flatten and curve downward. This marks a shift from earlier behavior and could point to waning momentum. At the same time, the Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) has dropped to 65.79 after peaking near 84, even as prices continued to rise. This kind of bearish divergence is often an early warning of a possible reversal. Bitcoin key price levels to watch Currently, Bitcoin is facing resistance near $111,195, a level that coincides with a local high and the upper Bollinger Band. On the downside, support lies around the 20-day MA which is approximately $109,191, the 50-day MA, which is near $105,595, and the 200-day MA at $96,716. If Bitcoin fails to push past the $111,195 resistance level and the RSI keeps trending lower, a pullback toward the 20- or 50-day MA may follow. A drop below the 200-day average could signal a more bearish medium-term outlook. On the flip side, a clean breakout above the upper Bollinger Band would invalidate the bearish divergence and confirm the continuation of the bullish trend. Bitcoin is currently holding steady at nearly $110,000 despite lingering recession concerns. Notably, momentum is gaining support from increased corporate interest in holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset. For instance, as reported by Finbold, Trump Media and Technology Group (NASDAQ: DJT ), the parent company of Truth Social and partly owned by Donald Trump, announced a $2.5 billion capital raise to purchase Bitcoin. The funding includes a $1.5 billion stock sale and $1 billion in zero-coupon senior secured bonds. The deal is expected to close on May 29.

In a series of viral posts on X , he predicts a severe economic collapse in the U.S., possibly even worse than the Great Depression. His bold prediction? Bitcoin will climb past $1 million by 2035 as people rush to safe-haven assets. With rising national debt, growing credit card balances, increasing unemployment, and shrinking retirement savings, Kiyosaki believes the traditional ways to protect wealth might fail. Instead, he points to gold, silver, and Bitcoin as the best options to safeguard investments during the crisis. A “Greater Depression” Is Coming: What Kiyosaki Sees in the Economy Kiyosaki’s alarming outlook summarizes the U.S. economy and the serious problems it faces. National debt has reached a massive $36.22 trillion. Credit card debt hit a new high of nearly $1.21 trillion in 2025. Unemployment rates are rising. Retirement savings continue to decline. Kiyosaki calls this coming crisis the “Greater Depression,” warning it could be worse than anything the country has seen before. He advises investors to move away from stocks, bonds, and ETFs – which could lose value – and instead focus on safer assets that hold their worth in tough times. His predictions include: Gold rising to $30,000 per ounce Silver jumping to $3,000 per coin Bitcoin soaring beyond $1 million by 2035 Why Bitcoin Could Be the Best Safe Haven Kiyosaki has long been a Bitcoin supporter . In his latest tweets, he shared that making money with Bitcoin was “so easy” for him. He believes that even a small amount – just 0.01 Bitcoin – could become “priceless” within two years and help investors get very rich. The key factor is Bitcoin’s scarcity. Kiyosaki points out that only about 1-2 million Bitcoins are left to be mined, which increases its value as supply runs low. He urges people not to miss what he calls “the easiest time in history” to become financially free with Bitcoin. Take Action: Learn from the Experts Kiyosaki’s warnings come as other crypto leaders, like Michael Saylor and Raoul Pal, are buying up Bitcoin amid growing economic fears. With the U.S. economy showing signs of serious trouble, investors are asking: Are we heading for a new Great Depression? If so, will Bitcoin be the best way to protect and grow wealth? Kiyosaki’s advice is clear – it’s time to rethink your investment strategy, focus on safe-haven assets, and prepare for a financial future that could be very different from today.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/robert-kiyosaki-warns-of-greater-depression-predicts-bitcoin-to-1-million/,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT","News",cryptocompare
2025-05-28T10:15:43.000Z,"Block to Launch Bitcoin Payments on Square Using Lightning Network by 2026","Jack Dorsey’s Block, Inc. is making a major move toward Bitcoin integration by announcing plans to enable Bitcoin payments on Square, its popular payment processing platform. The announcement was made during the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 27, where Block showcased a live demonstration of the feature at the BTC Inc. merchandise store. The rollout is set to begin in the latter half of 2025, with full availability for all eligible Square sellers expected by 2026, pending regulatory approvals. Merchants will be able to accept Bitcoin via existing Square hardware using the Lightning Network, a fast and low-cost layer-2 protocol built on Bitcoin. Square will also offer merchants the flexibility to either hold the Bitcoin or automatically convert it to fiat currency in real time. “This is about economic empowerment for merchants who like to have options when it comes to accepting payments,” said Miles Suter, Block’s Bitcoin Product Lead. Block Aims to Making Bitcoin Payments Easier Square’s move builds on its existing Bitcoin Conversions feature, which already allows merchants to receive payments in Bitcoin. With the new Lightning-powered system, the customer experience becomes seamless—scan a QR code, and the transaction is settled in seconds, with Square managing the technical complexities in the background. To support this growing push toward Bitcoin adoption , Block also announced updates to its self-custody wallet, Bitkey. Starting in May, Bitkey will include new privacy and security enhancements, removing the need for traditional seed phrases while maintaining control in the hands of users. These updates aim to make self-custody more accessible for everyday users, further reinforcing Block’s long-term commitment to Bitcoin infrastructure. Bitcoin Proves Cost-Effective for Businesses At the same conference, Dan Edwards, COO of American fast-food chain Stake n’ Shake, revealed the financial benefits the company has already seen from Bitcoin payments. “Our experience so far with Bitcoin has been that it is faster than credit cards,” he said. “And when customers choose Bitcoin, we save around 50% in processing fees.” Stake n’ Shake officially began accepting Bitcoin payments at all of its global locations on May 16, following a May 9 announcement. Edwards highlighted the triple-win effect: lower costs for the business, a streamlined experience for customers, and greater adoption for the Bitcoin community.

The former director is accused of misusing ACX customer funds totaling over $20 million. The Australian Securities and Investment Commission announced Wednesday proceedings against Liang Guo for allegedly misusing user funds and failing to keep proper financial records. He was also accused of making misleading statements while serving as director at Blockchain Global Ltd. ASIC probes Australia’s non-defunct cryptocurrency exchange ASIC has filed a civil case against Blockchain Global's former director Allan Guo for alleged misconduct involving ACX Exchange, which collapsed in 2019. Claims include misuse of customer funds and false financial records. With $37.7M owed to creditors, this highlights ongoing… — SunLumi (@Girl_SunLumi) May 28, 2025 The Australian crypto exchange, now in liquidation, froze withdrawals in late 2019 and ultimately left over $20 million in claims from former customers. ASIC’s lawsuit culminates a years-long probe into one of Australia’s earliest and most damaging crypto exchange collapses. The crypto exchange collapsed in 2019 after customers could not withdraw funds or digital assets from their ACX Exchange accounts. Liquidators were later appointed to Blockchain Global on 11 February 2022. In November 2023, the liquidators released a report to ASIC with creditors showing potential breaches of the Corporations Act by current and former officials of Blockchain Global, including former director Guo. Liquidators revealed that as of October 2023, the crypto exchange had more than $58.6 million owed to unsecured creditors. They also found that roughly $22.7 million were unsecured creditor claims from former ACX exchange customers. The Australian regulator launched its formal investigation into the exchange’s collapse in 2024. The country’s Federal Court also imposed interim travel restrictions on Guo weeks later in a bid to prevent him from leaving the country as investigations into the company’s collapse continue. After the travel ban expired on August 20, the former director of the exchange fled the country on September 23 and has not returned. Justice Catherine Button, who presided over the case, noted that the ASIC accused Guo of diverting $1.69 million from an account designated for ACX Exchange investors to personal investments. He was also accused of transferring 21.11 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $1.3 million, to a private wallet under his control. ASIC investigates other officials from Blockchain Global Liquidator Andrew Yeo of Pitcher Partners found in an October 2023 report to ASIC and creditors that customer funds were co-mingled with company money and redirected into related entities. The scheme reflected former global exchange FTX’s misuse of customer funds, where billions were allegedly diverted to its affiliated trading firm, Alameda Research , without user consent. The former director at Blockchain Global told liquidators that wallet credentials for the exchange’s crypto holdings, worth several million dollars, were lost when his laptop was stolen in China in 2019. The incident was first reported in December 2021, but no police report was ever filed to substantiate the claim. Apart from Guo, other company directors, including Xue Lee and Zijang Xu, are under investigation for violations of corporate law. The duo is believed to be outside Australia, which makes Guo the primary focus within the country for the potential recovery of misappropriated funds. “The level of fraud here is staggering. Whether it’s cryptocurrency fraud or any other financial fraud, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. This office and our law enforcement partners will hold perpetrators accountable for these and other fraud schemes.” – Erek L. Barron , U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland. In a related case, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Lee on January 29 with involvement in a $1.89 billion cryptocurrency fraud scheme under the HyperTech umbrella. The SEC charged Lee with conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud as part of a larger crackdown on fraudulent activities within the crypto market. Court documents showed that from June 2020 to November 2022, Lee and his co-conspirators allegedly offered and sold investment contracts to the public through HyperFund’s online investment platform, which turned out to be false.

Telegram is expected to raise at least $1.5 billion in a bond issue on May 28, with support from existing backers like BlackRock and Abu Dhabi’s investment firm Mubadala, The Wall Street Journal reported . As part of the sale, Telegram is offering investors five-year bonds at a 9% yield, the report said, citing sources familiar with the matter. Telegram plans to use the proceeds to buy back remaining debt from bonds issued in 2021, which are due to mature in March 2026. Discounts for potential Telegram IPO Apart from existing Telegram bondholders like BlackRock and Mubadala, the sale is also expected to bring new investors, including the US hedge fund firm Citadel. The WSJ report came weeks after Bloomberg first reported on Telegram's bond sale in late April, with sources claiming that the company was holding investor meetings about a bond sale worth about $2 billion to refinance its debut debt offering from 2021. According to the Financial Times, Telegram’s new bond offering will allow investors to buy shares in a potential initial public offering at a 20% discount, mirroring the terms of previous bond sales.

2025-05-28T10:06:17.000Z,"The 2025 Millionaire Blueprint: Ethereum Price Prediction 2025 Experts Pivot to Bitcoin Solaris for Superior Returns","The post The 2025 Millionaire Blueprint: Ethereum Price Prediction 2025 Experts Pivot to Bitcoin Solaris for Superior Returns appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum’s position as a top-tier blockchain asset remains unchallenged in many ways. However, recent market patterns, slowing transaction throughput, and rising competition have analysts and investors asking a hard question: Is Ethereum still the most promising vehicle for life-changing returns? According to a growing chorus of experts analyzing 2025 crypto forecasts, a shift is already happening. While Ethereum continues consolidating above $2,500, many analysts are now turning their attention to Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S)—a next-generation project they claim may offer superior ROI potential, greater accessibility, and unmatched scalability. Ethereum’s 2025 Outlook: Strong, but Capped? Ethereum has recently stabilized, defending support above $2,500 after struggling to break out from the $2,700 zone. While technical indicators such as a slight MACD bullish crossover and RSI nearing 50 suggest strength may return, the lack of strong volume is a concern. Even bullish price forecasts hover around $6,000–$7,500 by 2025. Yes, Ethereum remains vital to DeFi and Web3. But investors seeking exponential upside, especially those priced out of ETH’s current levels, are starting to look elsewhere. Enter Bitcoin Solaris: A New Wealth Blueprint Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is designed for one thing: to become the next-generation alternative to Bitcoin and Ethereum, offering real wealth-building potential without the high entry barriers or technical complexity. While Ethereum evolves slowly through layer-2 solutions, Bitcoin Solaris launches with a dual-consensus architecture that blends Proof-of-Work (PoW) for base-layer security and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) for fast, energy-efficient smart contract execution. The result? A chain capable of 10,000 transactions per second with 2-second finality—blazing past Ethereum and Ripple. Unlike Ethereum’s gas-fee woes, BTC-S boasts 99.95% lower energy consumption than Bitcoin and no bottlenecks. Plus, it’s designed to support mining from common devices like smartphones and laptops, removing technical hurdles and empowering everyday users. It’s no surprise, then, that top influencers are paying attention. Crypto Legends praised Bitcoin Solaris as “the next evolution of Bitcoin.” Meanwhile, Crypto Dex World praised Bitcoin Solaris as ‘a must-have project for serious investors’. Your Smartphone Just Became a Crypto Powerhouse—Start with BTC-S Not Just Technology—A Movement Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just promising speed or DeFi compatibility. It’s building a movement for fair access. The upcoming Solaris Nova app, though not yet available, is being developed to allow mining on mobile and desktop devices, inviting first-time investors into a world that was once only accessible to crypto elites. Security is also a core pillar. Bitcoin Solaris has successfully passed two independent audits—one by Cyberscope and another by Freshcoins —along with a KYC certification via Freshcoins , giving early participants confidence in the project’s legitimacy and transparency. Why Analysts See BTC-S as the Better Play for 2025 Lower entry price and higher upside potential compared to ETH Built-in scalability from day one—no reliance on rollups or upgrades More inclusive mining is designed for non-technical users Fixed 21M supply like Bitcoin, enabling long-term value retention Immediate Solana compatibility, with 1:1 token migration to the Bitcoin Solaris native chain once live The Clock Is Ticking Bitcoin Solaris is in Phase 5 of its presale, with a current price of $5. The next price increase takes it to $6, and the launch is set for $20. With over 11,000 unique users and $1.2M+ already raised, the momentum is undeniable. And with only weeks left until the July 31, 2025, cutoff, this is one of the shortest, most high-impact presales on record. Final Thoughts Ethereum will always have a place in the crypto ecosystem, but its growth curve may already be priced in. For those seeking outsized returns in 2025 and beyond, Bitcoin Solaris offers a clean slate: strong tech, low energy use, real accessibility, and an explosive upside. The future of wealth building may not lie in chasing legacy tokens but in pivoting early to the next breakout chain.

2025-05-28T10:05:27.000Z,"EU must scrap ill-fitting GDPR rules for blockchains or miss out | Opinion","Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. Last month, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) quietly published Guidelines 02/2025 on the processing of personal data through blockchain technologies. Buried in paragraph 63 is a line that jolted the entire web3 stack: “When deletion has not been taken into account by design, this may require deleting the whole blockchain.” That one clause converts GDPR from the world’s privacy gold standard into a kill-switch for every permissionless network. Yes, that includes Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and the hundreds that settle trillions of dollars a year. You might also like: The moment for mass adoption is here, and crypto’s still not ready | Opinion The reality is worse than it seems because deleting every node is the only surefire way to “forget” a transaction. The guideline effectively makes permissionless networks non-compliant by default. Public consultation comes to a close on June 9—after that, the text hardens into Europe’s enforcement playbook. After that, Europe’s future is set. GDPR was never written for tamper-proof ledgers The 2018 GDPR authors assumed that data lives on centrally controlled servers where a single operator can erase it. Fast-forward to modern-day public blockchains; the opposite is true. Blockchains are distributed, immutable, and borderless. Public chains rely on thousands of independent nodes that jointly guarantee history. Since rewriting a block would destroy that integrity, Article 17’s “right to be forgotten” collides head-first with the very feature that makes blockchains trustworthy. Techniques such as salted hashes, zero-knowledge proofs, and off-chain data pointers already minimize or obfuscate personal information—the new draft barely acknowledges them. Instead, it assumes that a single “data controller” can be identified, which is another notion that undermines decentralization and permissionless network integrity. Sovereign-cloud ambitions are at risk For two years, Brussels has promised a sovereign cloud—digital autonomy on European terms. The Commission’s latest policy goals are explicit. By 2030, three-quarters of EU businesses should run on cloud-edge technology; 10,000 climate-neutral edge nodes must be live, and the forthcoming Cloud and AI Development Act vows to triple the EU’s data-centre capacity within seven years. All of this is framed as digital sovereignty. The problem is, sovereignty requires independence. Today, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud still hold roughly 70% of Europe’s cloud market. Members of the European Parliament warn that without an indigenous backbone, EU data remains one United States subpoena away from offshore exposure. The only architecture that can realistically break that grip is a decentralized cloud in which infrastructure providers are coordinated by blockchain incentives, while data stays inside European data centres. If the EDPB renders those ledgers illegal by design, Brussels will hard-wire the very dependency it claims to end. Paragraph 63 would kneecap Europe’s builders By threatening whole-chain deletion whenever a single record cannot be erased, the draft injects existential risk into every European web3 project and ices any future venture funding. Its bias toward permissioned ledgers nudges developers back to the centralized silos policymakers say they oppose. Labeling volunteer validators “data controllers” would saddle hobbyists with corporate-grade liability, shrink node participation, and weaken network security. Treating every peer-to-peer link as a regulated international transfer risks splintering global consensus behind national borders. Requiring human overrides for smart contracts breaks composability and undermines everything from decentralized finance to on-chain Environmental Social and Governance reporting, which big energy companies have already piloted. A joint call-to-action from the European Crypto Initiative (EUCI) and Web3Privacy Now warns that the draft guidelines “fundamentally threaten the existence of public blockchains” across Europe. What more evidence does the EU need to see that including this paragraph will kneecap its own builders? Privacy-by-design beats prohibition A cleaner path preserves both privacy and decentralization. Destroying an encryption key or proving in zero-knowledge that the key is irretrievable satisfies the intent of Article 17 without dismantling a ledger. The guidelines should recognize cryptographic deletion alongside physical erasure, state that a 32-byte on-chain hash is not personal data, and treat validators as processors rather than “controllers.” Brussels has already shown through the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation that bespoke rules for frontier tech can be crafted without blanket bans. Striking the kill-switch sentence, codifying key-to-dust deletion, and clarifying validator status would align GDPR with technical reality, all while keeping Europe’s sovereign-cloud strategy alive. The public-comment portal closes in less than a month, and unless paragraph 63 is rebalanced, Europe risks spending the next decade paying U.S. hyperscalers to host ‘sovereign’ data. Meanwhile, the rest of the world will build on auditable, privacy-preserving rails beyond Brussels’ reach. With time fast running out, builders, investors, and policymakers should hit that comment portal now, before Europe locks itself out of its own digital future.

Will BTC Purchases Stop This Time?","El Salvador, which has accepted Bitcoin as legal currency and signed a loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in recent months. In exchange for the loan, the IMF wanted to impose a series of restrictions on El Salvador, such as reducing its BTC purchases. However, during this process, El Salvador continued to buy Bitcoin despite the IMF's pressure to restrict it. While El Salvador continues to purchase BTC, a new statement came from the IMF. The IMF announced that the initial review of the $1.4 billion loan agreement has been completed and that it has agreed to pay $120 million to the country in the first phase. The IMF said on May 27 that as part of the agreement, El Salvador will be required to fulfill its previous obligations to limit government interference in Bitcoin. The IMF also said it would work to ensure that the amount of Bitcoin held by the government of El Salvador remains unchanged. “On Bitcoin, the IMF will continue efforts to ensure that the total amount of Bitcoin held in all government wallets remains unchanged.” This stance contradicts President Nayib Bukele’s statements about increasing the country’s Bitcoin holdings. The IMF also reiterated its stance that El Salvador should stop accumulating Bitcoin and not engage in any other Bitcoin-related activities. Bitcoin Purchases Continue Despite IMF! Shortly after the IMF’s announcement on May 27, El Salvador once again shared that it was purchasing Bitcoin.

2025-05-28T10:00:35.000Z,"Crypto czar Sacks says America could ‘acquire more Bitcoin’","David Sacks, the White House’s senior advisor on artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency, stated Tuesday that the US government has a legal path to acquire more Bitcoin under an executive order signed by President Donald Trump earlier this year. Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference during a fireside chat with Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Sacks explained that although he could not guarantee federal purchases of Bitcoin, the executive order permits an acquisition, if done in a manner “that does not increase the national debt or require new taxes.” Crypto Czar says US government can buy Bitcoin According to Sacks, the executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve only allowed the US to use Bitcoin held by the government from criminal or civil asset forfeitures. Yet, the order’s language also authorizes future purchases contingent upon compliance with federal budgeting constraints. “ If it can be done in a budget-neutral way, specifically, if either the Commerce Department or the Treasury Department can figure out how to fund it without adding to the debt, then they are allowed to create those programs ,” Sacks explained. Cabinet secretaries like Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent could greenlight such acquisitions should they find unused funds from existing federal programs. “ I can’t promise anything ,” Sacks said, “ but there is a pathway to doing that… if they can figure out how to fund it, they actually do have presidential authorization ready .” AI, Bitcoin, and energy When asked about what the Trump administration has planned for AI and cryptocurrency in the next 100 days, Sacks told the Winklevoss twins that one of the President’s primary agendas is to improve America’s energy sector. Drawing a parallel between AI’s dependence on GPU-powered data centers and Bitcoin mining’s reliance on ASIC machines, he stressed that the West needs a domestic energy expansion. “ You need electricity to power GPUs for AI data centers. And you need it for Bitcoin ASICs to generate hash power ,” he said. “ We need a lot more power to basically fuel this future of AI and crypto. ” Sacks praised the administration’s energy stance, citing Trump’s push to expand US oil and gas production under the slogan “drill, baby, drill.” “ Beyond ‘drill, baby, drill,’ we need to build, baby, build ,” he continued, “ it just needs to be a lot easier in the United States .” US crypto-focused executive actions On President Trump’s first full day in office, he pardoned Ross Ulbricht, the convicted founder of Silk Road. Two days later, the administration issued an executive order prohibiting the development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), formally ended Operation Choke Point 2.0, and launched the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets. By March, Trump had signed the order to establish the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, treating Bitcoin as a national reserve asset for the first time in US history. Additionally, the White House hosted the inaugural Digital Assets Summit, the first time the crypto industry was formally acknowledged at such a level.

2025-05-28T10:00:00.000Z,"While Debates on Will Shiba Inu Coin Reach $1 Continue, Bitcoin Solaris Builds Sustainable Growth Infrastructure","The question “Will Shiba Inu coin reach $1?” continues to echo across YouTube comments and crypto forums. Millions cling to that dream. But behind that hope is a mathematical wall—a $1 price would require Shiba Inu’s market cap to exceed $589 trillion, nearly six times the entire global economy. That’s not a strategy. That’s gambling. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is laying the foundations of real wealth, real technology, and real user empowerment. While others are waiting for miracles, BTC-S is shipping infrastructure, enabling mobile mining, and rewarding everyday users for contributing to the ecosystem. Bitcoin Solaris Is Redefining What Mining Looks Like Mining has always been seen as exclusive. Expensive. Complex. Reserved for tech pros with rooms full of gear. Bitcoin Solaris is changing that narrative completely. Using its dual-layer blockchain powered by Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS), BTC-S enables fast, low-energy, and highly scalable mining from devices that users already own. Through the upcoming Solaris Nova App, people can mine BTC-S on: Smartphones (Android/iOS) Laptops or desktop computers GPU/ASIC rigs (optional for advanced users) No overheating. No complex setup. No power bills draining your wallet. Just one tap to start, and your mining session is underway. The app automatically adjusts to your device’s capacity, ensuring optimal performance and energy efficiency. This is mining built for the 21st century, and it’s why Bitcoin Solaris is drawing attention from serious builders, not just speculators. Presale Details: A Launch That’s Gaining Real Traction Bitcoin Solaris is now in Phase 5 of its presale, with momentum accelerating fast: Current Price: $5 Next Phase: $6 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 11% Unlike speculative coins banking on hype, BTC-S is offering early access to a functioning ecosystem. The presale lasts only 90 days, with the official launch set for July 31, 2025. Already, over $1.2 million has been raised, and more than 11,000+ unique users have joined in. The estimated 1,900% return isn’t just numbers—it’s backed by a working product, upcoming app release, real token distribution, and transparent smart contract audits. Influencers Are Already Talking One of the most notable early deep dives into Bitcoin Solaris comes from Crypto Dex World , who provided a thorough breakdown of why BTC-S stands out. From mobile mining to energy efficiency and the Nova app’s intuitive design, the review emphasizes that Bitcoin Solaris isn’t a moment—it’s a movement. Follow updates on X , or join the growing community on Telegram . The future isn’t just being debated—it’s being built. Referral Program: Double Rewards, Double Growth To encourage community growth during the presale, Bitcoin Solaris introduced a Double Rewards Referral Program. Here’s how it works: Referrer: Earns 5% commission in BTC-S for every presale purchase made through their link. Referred: Gets a 5% bonus on their purchase amount—more tokens for the same price. Getting started is simple: Log in at bitcoinsolaris.com Copy your unique referral link Share it across crypto communities, social media, or with friends and investors Unlike typical referral programs, both sides benefit equally. It’s not just about driving traffic—it’s about growing together. Conclusion: Hype Fades. Infrastructure Pays. Shiba Inu isn’t the enemy—but the hype around whether it can ever reach $1 is a distraction from real opportunities. The numbers don’t lie, and wishful thinking won’t rewrite economic law. Bitcoin Solaris, on the other hand, is building quietly, delivering steadily, and growing daily. From its mobile-first mining experience to its transparent presale and rewarding community programs, BTC-S is setting the stage for sustainable crypto growth. If you’re tired of watching and ready to build—this is your window.

The on-chain transaction between Bitcoin and Cardano was facilitated by BitVMX , an interoperability protocol built using the BitVM programming language. The transaction was unveiled by Input | Output (IO), the creator of the layer 1 Cardano, at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on Tuesday. The bridge represents a \""preview of what is to come,\"" IO said in an emailed announcement. Its ultimate aim is a full integration between Bitcoin and Cardano, providing DeFi services for BTC users and unlocking huge amounts of liquidity from the value stored in bitcoin. To this end, IO has developed the \""Cardinal\"" protocol, a portmanteau of Cardano and Ordinals, which harnesses BitVMX to assign Bitcoin-native assets to addresses on Cardano. The Ordinals protocol was introduced at the start of 2023, enabling the inscription of data onto individual satoshis (the smallest BTC denomination, equivalent to one 100 millionth of a bitcoin), this making them unique and traceable. In effect, this created a Bitcoin equivalent of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

But according to top crypto analysts, that wait might be almost over, and what’s coming next could feel like a massive wave for altcoins. The Calm Before the Altcoin Storm? When markets are quiet, emotions tend to take over. Many investors are starting to believe that the altcoin run is already over, or worse, that a bear market is around the corner. Meanwhile, seasoned crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe recently reminded investors that most altcoins are still trading near their bottom levels. That might sound negative at first, but here’s the twist, bottoms often come right before major rallies. I don't understand why people start claiming that a bear market is around the corner for #Altcoins . They are literally on the bottom. The BTC valuations have been declining massively. The money printer is about to get started. The final easy 12-24 months are coming. — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) May 27, 2025 Van de Poppe believes that the next 12 to 24 months could offer the “final easy” gains for altcoin holders before the market shifts again. Momentum Is Building, Quietly If you’ve been watching the charts, you’ll notice Bitcoin has been grabbing most of the attention, both in headlines and in market dominance. As of now, bitcoin dominance has hit its peak of 64%, which suggests that the turnaround is near. Meanwhile, popular altcoins like Solana, ADA, and XRP have shown some movement but are still trading well below their all-time high price. Solana, for example, has risen nearly 15% in the last 30 days, now sitting around $173. But zoom out a bit, and it’s still down more than 30% from highs seen just a few months ago. XRP tells a similar story, small short-term gains, but still far from previous highs. Traders Predict a Shift Despite the growing bitcoin dominance, Crypto experts like Davinci Jeremie and other analysts are backing van de Poppe’s outlook. They believe the tide is turning, and once it starts, altcoins could explode in value. Yet, many altcoins remain underperformers, and market sentiment hasn’t shifted fully. Currently, Altcoin Season Index sits at just 25 . To begin the altcoin season, at least 50 altcoins need to outperform BTC’s performance. But if these traders are right, altcoins might soon get their moment to shine, and it could happen faster than most expect.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/altcoin-season-is-still-alive-top-traders-say-the-best-is-yet-to-come/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

2025-05-28T09:40:44.000Z,"US spot Ethereum ETFs Surge with $38.8M Inflows","BitcoinWorld US spot Ethereum ETFs Surge with $38.8M Inflows The world of cryptocurrency investing just got a significant boost, particularly for those eyeing exposure to Ethereum. Recent data confirms a notable trend: US spot Ethereum ETFs are attracting substantial capital, signaling growing confidence and interest from investors. What’s Driving the Latest Ethereum ETF Inflows? According to figures released by Farside Investors, US spot Ethereum ETFs collectively experienced a net inflow of $38.8 million on May 27th. This single-day performance is part of a larger, encouraging pattern – it marked the seventh consecutive trading day where these newly approved investment products saw more money come in than go out. This consistent positive flow suggests a building momentum following the initial regulatory steps towards their launch. While the total figures are still modest compared to the early days of Bitcoin spot ETFs, the trend itself is highly significant. Breaking Down the ETH ETF Performance While the total figure tells one story, looking at individual fund performance provides more detail on where the money is heading. On May 27th: BlackRock’s ETHA led the charge, pulling in a substantial $32.5 million in net inflows. As one of the world’s largest asset managers, BlackRock’s participation and early success in attracting funds are particularly noteworthy. Fidelity’s FETH followed, adding $3.4 million to its holdings. Fidelity is another major player whose involvement lends considerable credibility to the space. VanEck’s ETHV saw $2.9 million in net inflows, demonstrating interest beyond just the two largest funds. Other approved ETFs reported no change in their holdings on that specific day, which is not uncommon in the early stages of such products. This distribution highlights that while multiple issuers have received approval, initial investor capital appears to be concentrating in funds offered by established financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity. Why Are These Inflows Important for the Crypto ETF Market? The emergence and subsequent performance of US spot Ethereum ETFs represent a critical evolution in the broader Crypto ETF market . For years, investors seeking direct exposure to cryptocurrencies faced hurdles, including setting up crypto exchange accounts, managing private keys, and navigating varying regulatory landscapes. Spot ETFs change this. They offer a regulated, familiar investment vehicle that allows investors, particularly institutional ones, to gain exposure to the price movements of Ethereum without directly holding the underlying asset. This significantly lowers the barrier to entry for traditional finance participants. The positive inflows, even if not yet in the billions seen by Bitcoin ETFs, validate the market’s appetite for these products and pave the way for potentially larger capital allocations in the future once trading officially commences. What Does This Mean for Institutional Crypto Adoption? The consistent inflows into ETH ETF products are a strong indicator of growing Institutional crypto adoption . Large firms, wealth managers, and institutional investors typically prefer regulated products like ETFs over direct crypto ownership due to compliance requirements, ease of management, and integration into existing financial systems. BlackRock and Fidelity attracting the bulk of early inflows underscores this point. These are firms catering to massive pools of institutional and high-net-worth capital. Their clients now have a straightforward way to add Ethereum exposure to diversified portfolios. While retail investors will also benefit from the accessibility, the primary significance of spot crypto ETFs often lies in unlocking institutional demand, which has the potential to bring substantial liquidity and stability to the market over time. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for US Spot Ethereum ETFs? While the approval of US spot Ethereum ETFs was a major milestone, the next crucial step is the commencement of trading. This requires approval of the S-1 registration statements from the SEC. The timing of this remains uncertain, though many analysts anticipate it could happen in the coming weeks or months. Once trading begins, the market will be watching closely to see if the positive inflow trend continues and accelerates. Factors that could influence future inflows include: Overall market sentiment for cryptocurrencies. Ethereum’s price performance. The success of the ETFs in attracting both retail and institutional capital. Further regulatory clarity or developments. The current streak of inflows, even pre-trading, suggests a pent-up demand that is starting to materialize. This bodes well for the potential impact these products could have on the Ethereum ecosystem and the broader digital asset investment landscape. In Summary The recent data showing US spot Ethereum ETFs attracting $38.8 million in net inflows on May 27th, extending a streak to seven consecutive days, is a positive development for the crypto market. Led by significant contributions from BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck, these inflows highlight growing interest and anticipation ahead of official trading commencement. This trend is a key indicator of increasing Institutional crypto adoption and represents a significant step forward for the Crypto ETF market , offering regulated access to Ethereum. As we await the final regulatory green light for trading, the sustained positive flow into these ETH ETF products signals a promising future for mainstream investment in Ethereum.

2025-05-28T09:39:16.000Z,"Loan at Risk as IMF Presses El Salvador on Bitcoin Buys","While the IMF insists that the government should stop using its Chivo wallet and freeze further Bitcoin acquisitions, President Nayib Bukele’s administration continues to defy these conditions. In fact, El Salvador bought 30 more BTC in May alone. Analysts speculate El Salvador could still comply with IMF terms by routing purchases through third parties. Meanwhile, Japanese firm Metaplanet is escalating its own Bitcoin strategy by raising $50 million via zero-interest bonds backed by Evo Fund to increase its holdings beyond 7,800 BTC. However, critics argue that investors are overvaluing firms like Metaplanet and Strategy, and suggest that direct Bitcoin purchases offer better value. Adding to Bitcoin’s mainstream momentum, Jack Dorsey's Block Inc. announced it will roll out Bitcoin payments via Square by 2026 using the Lightning Network, promising speed, lower fees, and greater merchant flexibility. El Salvador Under IMF Scrutiny The International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced on May 27 that it reached a staff-level agreement to disburse $120 million to El Salvador, contingent upon executive board approval. This payout follows an initial review of the $1.4 billion, 40-month loan agreement that was signed last year. However, the disbursement comes with certain conditions—particularly regarding El Salvador’s continued involvement with Bitcoin. The IMF explained that the government must cease operations related to the Chivo wallet by the end of July and must ensure that the amount of Bitcoin held across all government-owned wallets remains unchanged. Despite these terms, El Salvador appears to be maintaining its pro-Bitcoin stance . Just hours after the IMF announcement, the country's Bitcoin Office posted on X that it had once again to its Bitcoin holdings. According to the official Bitcoin tracker , El Salvador acquired 30 BTC over the past 30 days, bringing its national Bitcoin reserve to 6,190.18 BTC. This persistent acquisition strategy is in line with President Nayib Bukele’s ongoing plan to purchase one Bitcoin per day . The IMF reiterated earlier in March that El Salvador should halt Bitcoin accumulation and avoid launching new Bitcoin-related initiatives. Yet Bukele’s administration remains firm, and recently announced that the country's Bitcoin holdings are now at an unrealized profit of $386 million. This is a gain of 132% on the total investment. (Source: BitBo ) While the IMF continues to call for restraint, some analysts, including intergovernmental blockchain adviser Anndy Lian,proposed that El Salvador may still technically comply with IMF conditions by routing purchases through non-governmental entities. Meanwhile, IMF officials acknowledged that the country is currently in compliance with broader performance criteria, which only complicates the enforcement of Bitcoin-related conditions. Metaplanet Ramps Up Bitcoin Holdings El Salvador is not alone in its BItcoin accumulation mission. Japanese investment firm Metaplanet announced a $50 million private placement of zero-interest bonds to help expand its Bitcoin holdings. The May 28 announcement revealed that the bonds, issued in $1.25 million increments, will not offer investors any periodic interest payments. Instead, profits—if any—will be realized solely through the bond’s redemption value at maturity. Part of Metaplanet’s announcement The sole investor in this round is Evo Fund, a Cayman Islands-based investment firm that served as Metaplanet’s principal backer in its Bitcoin acquisition initiatives. Evo Fund consistently subscribed to previous rounds of Metaplanet’s zero-interest bonds and continues to support the firm’s crypto-focused capital deployment. The new bonds are unsecured and come with no guarantees or collateral, which implies that the level of trust between the two entities is quite impressive. Despite the size of the issuance, Metaplanet stated that the bonds are expected to have minimal impact on its 2025 financial results, though the company promised to disclose any relevant updates in the future. The decision to raise capital through this unconventional bond structure is part of a trend among firms seeking alternatives to fiat-based treasury strategies. Metaplanet's move also follows its second-largest Bitcoin purchase to date, where it acquired 1,004 BTC worth over $100 million, bringing its total holdings to 7,800 BTC valued at more than $800 million. Metaplanet Bitcoin holdings (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.net ) The company’s aggressive accumulation strategy has greatly affected its market valuation. According to a report by 10x Research on May 27, Metaplanet’s stock is trading as if its Bitcoin holdings were worth five times their actual value. This fueled criticism from some financial circles, including veteran investor Jim Chanos , who argued at the Sohn Investment Conference in New York that investors are overpaying for Bitcoin exposure through companies like Metaplanet and Strategy. Chanos revealed that he is selling shares in these firms to buy Bitcoin directly, which suggests that direct exposure offers more accurate value and potentially higher returns than relying on corporate wrappers. Square to Roll Out Bitcoin Payments by 2026 In other Bitcoin-related news, Jack Dorsey’s Block, Inc. is set to bring Bitcoin payments to Square, its popular merchant payment platform. The company unveiled the plan during the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 27, and showcased the feature at the BTC Inc. merchandise booth. Bitcoin payments will be facilitated using the Lightning Network, allowing for fast and low-cost transactions. The rollout is scheduled to begin in the second half of 2025, with full availability for all eligible Square sellers expected by 2026, pending regulatory clearance. The new feature will allow merchants to accept Bitcoin payments using existing Square hardware, with the option to either hold the received BTC or have it automatically converted into fiat currency in real-time. Jack Dorsey shared the update on X , and specifically pointed out the flexibility this offers to merchants. This initiative builds on Square’s current Bitcoin Conversions feature, which lets sellers convert a portion of their earnings into Bitcoin. According to Miles Suter, Block’s Bitcoin Product Lead, the goal is to give merchants more choice and economic empowerment when it comes to accepting payments. He described the integration as seamless for consumers, with payments made by simply scanning a QR code while Square and the Lightning Network handle the backend processing. In tandem with the Square announcement, Block revealed it is also enhancing the privacy and security of its Bitkey self-custody wallet. Bitkey launched in late 2023, and is receiving updates to improve accessibility and eliminate the need for traditional seed phrases, making self-custody much more user-friendly for the broader public. The benefits of Bitcoin payments were also pointed out by Dan Edwards, COO of the American fast food chain Stake n’ Shake . At the conference, Edwards said the company halved its payment processing fees since adopting Bitcoin as it it is faster than credit cards and significantly cheaper.

2025-05-28T09:36:45.000Z,"Bitcoin (BTC) Breakout or More Sideways Consolidation? Price Analysis","As every day passes, the potential Bitcoin breakout is awaited ever more keenly. $BTC hanging out above $108,000 since the beginning of the week is perhaps giving the impression that a breakout may not be far away. Are we in a final period of accumulation before the rocket boosters fire up, or could a significant rollover be about to take place? US Market Closure Boosts Bulls on Tuesday Reopening The US stock market was closed for the observance of Memorial Day on Monday, and this would have helped the market to digest the fallout over President Trump imposing, and then postponing 50% tariffs on Europe. Therefore, when markets opened on Tuesday, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq climbed steadily throughout the day. S&P 500 recommences strong rally Source: TradingView The S&P 500 is a sight to behold. The precipitous fall caused by the first few weeks of the Trump tariffs took the Index down 21% from the more than $6,100 high. However, an equally sharp rally since that bottom has taken the Index to within touching distance of $6,000, with a potential new all-time high just above that. Nasdaq bouncing back to all-time high Source: TradingView The Tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped even further to more than 26%, but as can be seen in the 2-week chart above, the index was held up by the ascending trendline. Currently at $19,199, the $20,195 all-time high is also not far away. The 2-week Stochastic RSIs for both indices show that there is plenty of gas in the tank for upside price momentum. Global money supply winning against mainstream doomsayers Mainstream media is full of how the US and global economies are failing, and how the Trump tariffs will eventually result in another stock market crash, scaring off investors. Nevertheless, global money supply continues to tick up, and should keep doing so into Q4 of 2025 as major economies are obliged to service their debts. $BTC heads towards next breakout point Source: TradingView The short-term chart for $BTC shows that the price is bouncing off of an ascending trendline and is heading towards a potential breakout of the above downtrend line. It will be important for the bulls to succeed in this breakout, given that a break down through the ascending trendline would likely take the price back at least to the major support at $106,600. $BTC 2-week chart bullish or bearish? Source: TradingView The 2-week chart for $BTC may even be taken as bearish at first glance. The current 2-week candle, just like the one before it, is failing to get above the resistance of the previous January all-time high at $109,300. That said, the MACD indicator at the bottom of the chart is signalling that the indicator lines are crossing up, and the first green histogram bar is being formed. It could be that the price dips back down to confirm the $104,000 horizontal support, but as long as this holds, the bullish upward trend is still in play. Of course, the price could also shoot skywards in these next 11 days if this last resistance can be surmounted. A catalyst for either direction could also play a role.

2025-05-28T09:20:52.000Z,"North Korea’s Lazarus Group steals over $5.2M from a crypto trader","North Korea’s Lazarus Group has been linked to a cyberattack that stole more than $5.2 million from a crypto trader on May 24, according to blockchain investigator ZackXBT. The theft occurred through a sophisticated malware attack, with funds siphoned from several wallet types including multisig, externally owned accounts (EOAs), and exchange wallets. The incident, revealed on ZackXBT’s Telegram channel on Tuesday, insinuated that the group could be changing their focus from high-net-worth individuals and companies to intraday individual traders. After the heist, approximately 1,000 ETH was funneled into Tornado Cash, a crypto-mixing service commonly used to obscure the origin of stolen digital assets. The stolen assets were then promptly liquidated on the open market. Addresses traced, Tornado Cash used to launder funds ZachXBT’s channel listed three Ethereum addresses tied to the heist. Along with minor token balances of QBX, Blocklords, Astra Protocol, and DAI totaling around $1,340, the principal address had more than 40 ETH, which is around $107,000 at current market values. It is thought that these funds were part of the malware attack’s profits. Last weekend, just nine transactions were processed using the second address, which seemed to be new. It sent more than 200 ETH to the main address. Finally, as of this publication, the other crypto address held around $2.7 million DAI, which was the majority of the stolen funds. This pattern of conduct is consistent with what was found in a recent study by TRM Labs, which details the worldwide web of Russian criminal organizations and Chinese over-the-counter brokers that North Korea uses to launder its illegal profits. The report alleges that Lazarus supplies the technical expertise, but their partners provide the channels to integrate stolen funds into markets legitimately. Money laundering continues in Q2 2025 In April, blockchain analytics firm SpotOnChain reported that a wallet believed to be associated with Lazarus offloaded 40.78 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) for $3.51 million. The Bitcoin, originally purchased in February 2023 for about $999,900 when WBTC traded at $24,521, was sold at $83,459 per coin for a profit of 251% over two years. Today, the Lazarus Group (North Korean hackers) sold 40.78 $WBTC ($3.51M) for a $2.51M profit (+251%)—after buying it 2 years ago. They spent 999.9K $USDT to acquire the $WBTC at ~$24,521 in Feb 2023, and sold it for 1,857 $ETH at ~$86,170 just 12 hours ago. The hackers then… pic.twitter.com/KYQmqnJnIC — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) April 3, 2025 The proceeds were converted into 1,847 ETH and later split among three wallets. The largest tranche of 1,865 ETH was traced to another wallet reportedly operated by the group. Instead of holding the converted ETH, Lazarus distributed 2,507 ETH across multiple addresses. DPRK-linked hackers were also connected to the infamous $1.5 billion hack on the Bybit crypto exchange. In the aftermath of the breach, the group allegedly laundered nearly 500,000 ETH, equivalent to about $1.39 billion, across multiple transactions within just ten days. 黑客已经把从 Bybit 盗取的 49.9 万枚 ETH ($13.9 亿) 全部清洗完了，整个过程历时 10 天。 ETH 价格在这个过程中下跌了 23% (从 $2,780 跌到现在的 $2,130)。 而黑客洗钱使用的主要通道 THORChain 也因黑客洗钱获得了 $59 亿的交易量跟 $550 万的手续费收入。 本文由 #Bitget ｜ @Bitget_zh 赞助 https://t.co/osoKNzFhkG pic.twitter.com/QUWuMmV6zH — 余烬 (@EmberCN) March 4, 2025 At least $605 million was funneled through the decentralized liquidity protocol THORChain in a single day. Yet, blockchain intelligence platform Arkham Intelligence estimates that wallets tied to Lazarus still hold approximately $1.1 billion in crypto reserves, including significant holdings in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether. Cybercrime funding nuclear ambitions United Nations investigators monitoring sanctions compliance believe that the proceeds from these cyberattacks are being funneled into North Korea’s weapons development programs. Between 2017 and 2023, the country reportedly used crypto-based revenue streams to improve its missile technology, increasing its capacity to strike targets far beyond the Korean peninsula. In a report published last December, Chainalysis confirmed that hackers connected to the regime stole over $1.3 billion in cryptocurrency in 2024 across 47 incidents. “ Hackers linked to North Korea have become notorious for their sophisticated and relentless tradecraft ,” the Chainalysis insight said, noting that these efforts are used to bypass international sanctions and fund the state’s illicit operations.

2025-05-28T09:20:33.000Z,"Bitcoin Mining Takes a Giant Leap: Bitmain Launches Antminer S23 Hydro","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Mining Takes a Giant Leap: Bitmain Launches Antminer S23 Hydro The world of Bitcoin mining is constantly evolving, pushing the boundaries of efficiency and performance. At the forefront of this innovation is Bitmain, the industry giant renowned for its Antminer series. Their latest reveal is set to make waves, quite literally, in the mining landscape: the Antminer S23 Hydro series. What is the Antminer S23 Hydro and Why Does it Matter for Bitcoin Mining ? Bitmain’s announcement of the Antminer S23 Hydro series at the World Digital Mining Summit (WDMS) 2025, as reported by Wu Blockchain on X, marks a significant milestone. This new generation of mining hardware is designed for large-scale operations, leveraging advanced hydro cooling technology to achieve performance levels previously unseen in their product line. Why is this important for Bitcoin mining ? Higher efficiency and hashrate mean miners can potentially mine more Bitcoin for the same or less energy cost (per terahash). This directly impacts profitability and the overall economics of the mining industry. As the Bitcoin network’s difficulty increases, more powerful and efficient machines like the S23 Hydro are crucial for staying competitive. Exploring the Specs: How Does the Antminer S23 Hydro Stack Up? Let’s dive into the technical specifications that make the Antminer S23 Hydro a powerhouse: Hashrate: Up to 580 TH/s (Terahashes per second). This is a substantial increase compared to previous generations, allowing miners to contribute significantly more processing power to the network. Energy Efficiency: A remarkable 9.5 J/TH (Joules per Terahash). Energy efficiency is perhaps the most critical metric for miners, directly impacting operational costs. A lower J/TH means less electricity is consumed per unit of hashing power. This 9.5 J/TH figure places the S23 Hydro among the most efficient machines currently available. Power Consumption: Consumes 5,510 watts of power. While the total power draw is high, it’s the efficiency relative to the hashrate that truly matters. To put this into perspective, let’s consider a simplified comparison (specific models and conditions vary): Model Cooling Max Hashrate Efficiency (J/TH) Approx. Power (W) Antminer S19j Pro Air ~100 TH/s ~29.5 J/TH ~2950 W Antminer S19 XP Hydro Hydro ~255 TH/s ~20.8 J/TH ~5304 W Antminer S23 Hydro Hydro ~580 TH/s ~9.5 J/TH ~5510 W As you can see, the S23 Hydro offers a massive leap in hashrate and a dramatic improvement in efficiency compared to earlier models, even within Bitmain’s hydro-cooled lineup. This makes it a highly attractive piece of crypto mining hardware for operations focused on optimizing their energy expenditure. The Power of Water: Understanding Hydro Cooling Mining Unlike traditional air-cooled miners that rely on fans to dissipate heat, the Antminer S23 Hydro utilizes liquid cooling. Here’s a quick look at how it works and its advantages: How it Works: A liquid coolant (often a mixture of water and glycol) is circulated through plates or channels in direct contact with the heat-generating components (the ASIC chips). This heated liquid is then pumped to a heat exchanger (like a radiator) where the heat is transferred to the air or another cooling medium, and the cooled liquid returns to the miner. Superior Heat Dissipation: Liquid is far more effective at absorbing and transferring heat than air. This allows the chips to run cooler, potentially increasing their lifespan and stability, and enabling higher performance. Increased Density: Hydro cooling allows miners to be packed much more closely together in a facility. Without the need for large air gaps between units and powerful fans, mining containers or buildings can house significantly more hashing power in the same footprint. Noise Reduction: Hydro-cooled systems are significantly quieter than air-cooled ones, which rely on numerous high-speed fans. This is a major benefit for large mining farms located near populated areas. Improved Efficiency: While the cooling system itself consumes power, the overall efficiency gain from the chips running optimally at higher clock speeds and the reduced need for massive air handling infrastructure often results in a lower overall J/TH compared to air-cooled setups at similar performance levels. Implementing hydro cooling mining requires specialized infrastructure, including pumps, piping, radiators, and a reliable water source or closed-loop system, which represents a significant upfront investment. Is the Antminer S23 Hydro Right for Your Farm? Actionable Insights for the Bitcoin Miner The Antminer S23 Hydro is not designed for the casual home Bitcoin miner . Its power consumption, cooling requirements, and likely price point make it suitable primarily for large-scale, professional mining operations. If you are considering upgrading or building a new facility, here are some actionable insights: Evaluate Infrastructure Costs: The capital expenditure for a hydro-cooled facility is much higher than for air-cooled. Factor in the cost of the cooling system, plumbing, and specialized racks. Assess Power Availability and Cost: With a 5.5 kW draw per unit, you need substantial, reliable, and affordable electricity. The S23 Hydro’s efficiency shines brightest where power costs are low. Consider Maintenance: Hydro systems require different maintenance expertise than air-cooled systems. Ensure you have the technical staff capable of managing liquid cooling infrastructure. Calculate ROI: Perform a detailed return on investment calculation based on the S23 Hydro’s price (when announced), your electricity cost, the current Bitcoin price, and the network difficulty growth projections. Its high efficiency offers potential for faster ROI, but the initial cost is key. Facility Location: Locations with access to natural cooling sources (like cold climates or nearby water bodies, used responsibly and legally) can further enhance the efficiency of hydro cooling. For large farms looking to maximize density and efficiency, the Antminer S23 Hydro represents a compelling option, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in professional Bitcoin mining . The Future of Crypto Mining Hardware The launch of the Antminer S23 Hydro series underscores a clear trend in the crypto mining hardware market: a move towards higher efficiency and liquid cooling solutions for large-scale operations. As Bitcoin’s halving events reduce block rewards, miners must become increasingly efficient to remain profitable. This drives manufacturers like Bitmain to innovate constantly. We can expect to see continued advancements in ASIC chip design, further reducing energy consumption per terahash. Liquid cooling, including single-phase and two-phase immersion cooling, is also likely to become more prevalent in professional setups due to its density and efficiency benefits. The competition among hardware manufacturers will likely intensify, leading to even more powerful and efficient machines in the future. In conclusion, Bitmain’s Antminer S23 Hydro series is a significant leap forward for Bitcoin mining technology. With its industry-leading efficiency and immense hashrate, it sets a new standard for high-performance crypto mining hardware . While requiring specialized infrastructure, its potential for increased profitability and operational density makes it a key development for large-scale miners navigating the increasingly competitive landscape. The trend towards more efficient, hydro-cooled solutions highlights the continuous innovation driving the future of digital asset mining.

So we are basically becoming more indebted over time, because the growth of the economy is not outpacing the growth of the debt. So there’s a massive need for what we call in the trade fiscal consolidation. We need to get our house in order and create revenues closer to spending.” In a separate Bloomberg interview, Millstein says that the US’s fiscal situation is concerning investors, which is why long-term Treasury yields have been rising lately. Millstein says the ten-year Treasury yields are increasing “because of the imbalance in the federal government’s finances and the huge amount of deficits they have to finance.” He also says there’s going to be “a huge supply of Treasuries coming to the market.” According to Millstein, the rising ten-year yields are the US’s largest financial challenge at the moment, as they increase the interest costs of existing and future debt. Millstein says the US may be facing a similar situation that occurred in the 1990s when bond yields rose enough to convince politicians to take action to lower the deficit.

There’s an evident lack of volatility from most altcoins as well, aside from SUI, which has surged by 6%, and XMR, which has dumped hard. BTC Calms at $109K Bitcoin reminded of its bull season last week when it finally broke above $109,000 (the January 2025 all-time high) and set a fresh peak of almost $110,000. That was last Wednesday, but it was not the only record set that week. After a violent but brief retracement, BTC went on the run once again and flew to almost $112,000 on Thursday – the Bitcoin Pizza Day – which became its latest peak . It stood close to that level on Friday before US President Trump recommended a new set of tariffs against the EU. This has a dramatic and immediate impact on BTC’s price, which tumbled by over three grand in minutes. Nevertheless, the bulls intervened and didn’t allow another nosedive. Just the opposite, bitcoin started to climb after the quiet weekend and jumped to $110,500 on Monday. It dropped back down to $107,500 before it aimed at $111,000 yesterday. It didn’t see any success there and is back to $109,000 as of now. Its market cap has declined slightly to $2.165 trillion on CG, and its dominance over the alts is just shy of 61%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView XMR Slumps The most volatile cryptocurrencies from the top 100 largest ones today are XMR and QNT. They stand on the opposite sides, though, as Monero has slumped by almost 12% to trade below $350. In contrast, QNT has gained 11% and sits close to $120. SUI is another notable gainer after some promising news on the Cetus hack front. The asset is up by 6% and trades above $3.7. In contrast, most other larger-cap alts, such as SOL, DOGE, ADA, XRP, TRX, HYPE, SHIB, and others, are slightly in the red. ETH and BNB have marked insignificant gains.

2025-05-28T09:12:00.000Z,"$11 trillion BlackRock recommends this much Bitcoin in your portfolio","At the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, Robert Mitchnick, reaffirmed the asset management giant’s recommendation that wealth managers allocate 1–2% of client portfolios to Bitcoin , a guidance that originated from BlackRock’s internal model portfolios published in December 2024. For context, BlackRock isn’t a niche crypto fund. It’s the largest asset manager in the world, with more than $11 trillion in assets under management. So when it nudges financial advisers toward even a modest BTC allocation, the signal is hard to ignore. Mitchnick explained the rationale behind the allocation, noting it’s the product of years of research, not a reaction to short-term price action. “That was not a sudden reaction to any one thing. That was the result of multiple years of analysis and research by that team, who runs those portfolios,” he said . The original December report highlighted Bitcoin’s potential to serve as a global monetary alternative and a macro hedge, particularly in regimes marked by currency debasement, geopolitical friction, or unconventional monetary policy. BlackRock sees Bitcoin as an alternative Speaking on the adoption of that guidance three months later, Mitchnick emphasized how BlackRock’s model portfolios function as infrastructure for financial advisers looking to build diversified, risk-aware portfolios for retail and high-net-worth clients. “Model portfolios have become very powerful tools to help FAs do that,” he noted. “At BlackRock, we have a very big asset base in the model portfolios that we build and equip our wealth adviser clients with. One of those portfolios, as you note in February this year, added Bitcoin as an allocation in the 1–2% range—a model portfolio that includes alternatives in it.” The key phrase is alternatives . Bitcoin, in this context, is not being viewed as a high-beta tech bet or a speculative punt. It’s being positioned alongside other non-correlated assets that can improve risk-adjusted returns over time. “The investment thesis behind that is the view of Bitcoin as a global monetary alternative that is attractive in a lot of states of the world,” he added. BlackRock’s framing suggests Bitcoin is beginning to mature into the same institutional toolkit as commodities, private equity, or infrastructure.

2025-05-28T09:10:30.000Z,"BlackRock Bitcoin: Unlock Potential with a 2% Portfolio Allocation Recommendation","BitcoinWorld BlackRock Bitcoin: Unlock Potential with a 2% Portfolio Allocation Recommendation In the ever-evolving landscape of finance, few endorsements carry as much weight as those from global giants like BlackRock. So, when a key executive from the world’s largest asset manager speaks about cryptocurrency, the investment community listens intently. This is precisely what happened when Robert Mitchnick, Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, recently shared his insights regarding Bitcoin allocation at the Bitcoin 2025 conference. According to a report by Crypto Rover on X, Mitchnick put forward a compelling recommendation: consider allocating a modest yet significant 2% of your investment portfolio allocation to BlackRock Bitcoin products or direct exposure. This isn’t just a casual remark; it stems from a considered view, particularly highlighting Bitcoin’s potential role as a safe haven asset in uncertain economic times. But what does this recommendation truly mean for investors, both seasoned and new to the world of digital assets? Let’s dive deep into the implications, benefits, challenges, and actionable steps related to this potentially transformative crypto investment strategy. Why a BlackRock Recommendation Matters for Your Portfolio Allocation BlackRock manages trillions of dollars in assets for institutions and individuals worldwide. Their move into the Bitcoin space, particularly with the launch of their spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), signaled a major shift in institutional acceptance of cryptocurrency. Robert Mitchnick’s role at the helm of their digital assets division places him at the forefront of this institutional charge into crypto. Therefore, his recommendation for a specific percentage portfolio allocation to Bitcoin isn’t just an opinion; it’s a view informed by extensive market analysis, risk assessment, and a deep understanding of institutional investment strategies. Historically, traditional finance institutions were wary, if not outright dismissive, of Bitcoin. BlackRock’s active participation, coupled with a specific allocation recommendation from a senior executive, legitimizes Bitcoin as a serious asset class worthy of consideration within a diversified portfolio. It moves Bitcoin from the fringes of speculative trading into the realm of strategic asset management, aligning it with traditional assets like stocks, bonds, and commodities. This shift in perception, driven by major players like BlackRock, is crucial for broader adoption and investor confidence. Understanding the 2% Bitcoin Allocation Strategy A 2% allocation might sound small in the context of a large portfolio, but it’s a percentage often used by financial advisors for alternative or high-growth potential assets. It represents a balance: large enough to potentially impact overall portfolio returns if Bitcoin performs well, but small enough that a significant downturn in Bitcoin wouldn’t catastrophically damage the entire portfolio. This risk management aspect is key to understanding the rationale behind such a recommendation, especially when considering the volatility inherent in crypto investment . Think of portfolio allocation like building a sturdy house. You need a strong foundation (stable assets), solid walls (growth assets), and perhaps some unique architectural features (alternative assets like Bitcoin) that can add value and character, but aren’t so dominant that their failure brings down the whole structure. A 2% Bitcoin allocation fits into this ‘alternative feature’ category, offering exposure to a potentially high-reward asset without overexposing the portfolio to its unique risks. This specific percentage isn’t arbitrary. It likely comes from sophisticated modeling that considers factors like historical Bitcoin volatility, correlation with traditional assets, and potential upside scenarios. For many investors, particularly those new to crypto, starting with a small, defined allocation like 2% provides a manageable entry point to gain exposure and become comfortable with the asset class without betting the farm. Is Bitcoin Truly a Safe Haven Asset? Exploring the Argument Mitchnick’s mention of Bitcoin as a safe haven asset is perhaps the most intriguing part of his recommendation. Traditionally, assets considered ‘safe havens’ are those expected to retain or increase in value during times of market turbulence, economic uncertainty, or geopolitical stress. Gold has long been the classic example, often referred to as a store of value that holds up when fiat currencies or stock markets falter. The argument for Bitcoin as a safe haven rests on several pillars: Decentralization: Bitcoin operates outside the control of any single government or central bank. This makes it potentially resilient to the inflationary policies or economic instability of any one nation. Scarcity: The total supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million coins, making it a deflationary asset by design, unlike fiat currencies which can be printed infinitely. This scarcity can make it attractive during periods of high inflation. Portability and Divisibility: Bitcoin can be easily stored, transferred, and divided, offering advantages over physical assets like gold. Global Accessibility: It can be accessed and used anywhere in the world with internet access, providing an alternative store of value for people in countries experiencing currency crises or political instability. However, the concept of Bitcoin as a safe haven is still debated. Critics point to its high volatility, which makes it seem counterintuitive to label it as ‘safe’. Its price can fluctuate wildly based on market sentiment, regulatory news, and macroeconomic factors, sometimes behaving more like a risk-on growth asset than a traditional safe haven . Its relatively short history compared to gold also means it hasn’t been tested across multiple full economic cycles as a store of value. Perhaps a more nuanced view is that Bitcoin is an *emerging* or *digital* safe haven, offering different properties than traditional ones. Its lack of correlation with traditional assets (though this correlation can change over time) could make it a valuable diversifier, providing protection against risks specific to traditional financial systems. Mitchnick’s perspective, coming from BlackRock, suggests that large institutions are increasingly considering this potential, even if the traditional definition of a safe haven doesn’t perfectly fit Bitcoin’s current market behavior. Beyond the Safe Haven: Other Reasons for Bitcoin Allocation While the safe haven narrative is compelling, it’s not the only reason investors might consider a Bitcoin allocation . Other factors contributing to its appeal include: Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has shown tremendous long-term growth potential since its inception. Proponents believe that increasing adoption, network effects, and its fixed supply could drive significant future price appreciation. Diversification: As mentioned, Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional assets can be low, offering diversification benefits that can potentially reduce overall portfolio risk and improve risk-adjusted returns. Inflation Hedge: Its fixed supply makes it an attractive hedge against inflation, particularly relevant in an era of significant government spending and monetary expansion. Technological Innovation: Investing in Bitcoin is also, in part, an investment in the underlying blockchain technology, which has potential applications far beyond currency. Institutional Adoption: The increasing interest and investment from major financial institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and others is seen as a validation of the asset class and a potential catalyst for future price increases. Considering these factors alongside the potential safe haven properties paints a fuller picture of why a Bitcoin allocation is gaining traction among serious investors and institutions. Challenges and Risks of Crypto Investment It’s crucial to approach any crypto investment with eyes wide open to the inherent challenges and risks. While a 2% Bitcoin allocation is designed to be manageable, it doesn’t eliminate risk entirely. Key considerations include: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience rapid and significant swings, both up and down. Investors must be prepared for this volatility and avoid investing funds they cannot afford to lose. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still developing globally. New regulations could impact Bitcoin’s price, usability, and legality. Security Risks: Holding Bitcoin requires careful attention to security. Private keys must be protected from theft or loss. While ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT mitigate some of these risks by handling custody, direct ownership carries significant personal responsibility. Market Manipulation: The crypto market is still relatively smaller and less regulated than traditional markets, potentially making it more susceptible to manipulation. Technological Risks: While the Bitcoin protocol has proven robust, potential risks like quantum computing threats (long-term), software bugs, or network congestion exist, albeit considered low probability by many experts. Understanding and accepting these risks is paramount before making any crypto investment , including a Bitcoin allocation suggested by institutions like BlackRock. How to Approach a 2% Bitcoin Allocation: Actionable Insights If you’re considering incorporating a 2% Bitcoin allocation into your portfolio, here are some actionable steps and considerations: Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Even a small allocation to a volatile asset requires comfort with potential losses on that portion of your portfolio. Determine Your Investment Vehicle: You can gain exposure through various means: Spot Bitcoin ETFs (like BlackRock’s IBIT): Offers easy access through traditional brokerage accounts, professional management, and regulated custody. This is likely what Mitchnick’s recommendation points towards for many investors. Bitcoin Futures ETFs: Track futures contracts, which can behave differently than the spot price. Direct Ownership: Buying Bitcoin on an exchange and storing it yourself (in a hardware or software wallet). This gives you direct control but requires significant technical and security responsibility. Stocks of Crypto-Related Companies: Investing in companies that hold significant Bitcoin (like MicroStrategy) or are involved in the crypto industry (like exchanges or mining companies). This provides indirect exposure. Calculate 2% of Your Portfolio: Determine the exact dollar amount this represents based on your total investable assets. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing the entire 2% lump sum at once, consider investing smaller amounts regularly over time. This can help mitigate the risk of buying at a market peak due to Bitcoin’s volatility. Rebalance Periodically: If your Bitcoin allocation grows significantly due to price appreciation, it might exceed the initial 2%. Consider rebalancing by selling some Bitcoin to bring it back to your target allocation, or conversely, buying more if its value drops significantly. Stay Informed: The crypto market moves fast. Keep up with news, regulatory developments, and technological advancements. Consult a Financial Advisor: A qualified financial advisor can help you determine if a Bitcoin allocation is suitable for your specific financial situation, goals, and risk profile, integrating it within your broader portfolio allocation strategy. Remember that a recommendation from an executive, even from BlackRock, is not financial advice tailored to your personal circumstances. It’s a high-level strategic view from the perspective of large-scale asset management. The Broader Impact of Institutional Interest on Crypto Investment The fact that a senior BlackRock executive is publicly discussing specific Bitcoin allocation percentages underscores the profound shift happening in the financial world. Institutional acceptance brings several potential benefits to the crypto investment space: Increased Liquidity: Larger players bring more capital, increasing market depth and potentially reducing volatility over the long term (though short-term volatility remains). Enhanced Legitimacy: Institutional participation validates Bitcoin as a serious asset class, potentially attracting more retail and institutional investors. Improved Infrastructure: As institutions enter the space, they demand and help build more robust, secure, and regulated infrastructure for trading, custody, and management of digital assets. Greater Accessibility: Products like spot Bitcoin ETFs make it easier for traditional investors to gain exposure without navigating the complexities of crypto exchanges and private key management. While the path won’t be without bumps, the trend of increasing institutional engagement, highlighted by recommendations like the 2% Bitcoin allocation from BlackRock, suggests a future where digital assets play a more integrated role in global financial portfolios. Conclusion: Navigating Your Crypto Investment Journey Robert Mitchnick’s recommendation of a 2% portfolio allocation to BlackRock Bitcoin products or direct exposure is a significant data point for anyone considering crypto investment . It signals that even within the world’s largest financial institutions, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed not just as a speculative gamble, but as a legitimate asset class with potential roles as a growth driver, a diversifier, and even a digital safe haven . While the 2% figure provides a concrete starting point suggested by a major player, the decision to invest in Bitcoin, and how much to allocate, remains a personal one. It requires careful consideration of your own financial goals, risk tolerance, and understanding of the asset’s unique characteristics and risks. The increasing ease of access through products like ETFs, championed by firms like BlackRock, lowers the barrier to entry, but the fundamental principles of sound investing still apply: do your research, understand what you’re investing in, and only invest what you can afford to lose. The conversation around BlackRock Bitcoin and optimal Bitcoin allocation is just beginning, marking an exciting time for the intersection of traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets.

Revenue from derivatives increased by 40%, reflecting increased interest from clients seeking crypto-based risk-management tools.The bank also said it invested in building a proprietary digital platform last year, aiming to serve business-to-consumer (B2C), business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-business-to-consumer (B2B2C) clients.The system, expected to launch later this year, will feature API-based infrastructure to handle increasing demand across markets.Mike Foy, chief financial officer at AMINA Bank, said the bank’s liquidity coverage ratio increased to 228% in 2024, up from 219% in 2023.“In addition, our CET1 capital ratio, which compares a bank’s capital against its risk-weighted assets, is more than double the regulatory requirement at 34%, despite an increase in risk-weighted assets as a result of our expansion,” Foy added.Related: Crypto projects prepare to battle for privacy in SwitzerlandAMINA’s international revenue growsAMINA also noted that its international revenue continues to increase, with income from its Abu Dhabi operations rising 150% year-over-year and Hong Kong posting 570% growth.

2025-05-28T09:59:06.000Z,"Fungible cryptos in secondary sales are not securities, Ripple tells SEC","Ripple, the blockchain company behind XRP, argued that fungible cryptocurrencies are not securities when transferred in secondary transactions in a recent letter sent to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).In its May 27 letter, Ripple cited US attorney and crypto law thought leader Lewis Cohen to support its claim. In his widely cited 2022 paper, “The Ineluctable Modality of Securities Law: Why Fungible Crypto Assets Are Not Securities,” he wrote:“[T]here is no current basis in the law relating to ‘investment contracts’ to classify most fungible crypto assets as ‘securities’ when transferred in secondary transactions.”In his paper, Cohen explained that in secondary transactions, an investment contract transaction is generally not present. He further claimed that fungible cryptocurrencies “neither create nor represent the necessary cognizable legal relationship between” a legal entity and the holder that is the “hallmark of a security.”Related: Banking groups ask SEC to drop cybersecurity incident disclosure ruleSEC’s “new paradigm”Ripple also referenced SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce's May 19 “new paradigm” speech. She said she’d been voicing her dissent with the regulator’s approach to crypto, adding:“Having emerged from the crypto dissent years, I am glad to be able speak to you today as the head of the Commission’s Crypto Task Force about a rational and coherent path forward and a new paradigm at the SEC.”Peirce said that the SEC’s “approach to crypto in recent years has evaded sound regulatory practice and must be corrected.” She also said that most cryptocurrencies are not securities, adding:“Most currently existing crypto assets in the market are not [securities]. My supplemental answer is that economic realities matter and non-security crypto assets may be distributed as part of an investment contract, which is a type of security.”Ripple’s long fight with the SECThe SEC had viewed a large portion of digital assets as securities, with the regulator’s former chair, Gary Gensler, stating in 2023 that most of the crypto market falls under the securities bracket. This stance led to a protracted legal battle between the SEC and Ripple.The lawsuit first began at the end of 2020, when the SEC took action against Ripple and its executives, claiming that XRP sales constituted unregistered security offerings. Still, after the government’s stance on crypto changed with the election of current US President Donald Trump, Ripple has mostly won the battle, with the SEC recently dropping its appeal against a ruling favorable to the company.In its recent letter to the SEC, Ripple also cited a ruling in the case noting that “the court held that certain of Ripple’s historical institutional sales of XRP were investment contracts,” while the secondary sales were not. Furthermore, the judge “determined that XRP itself is not a security.”Magazine: XRP win leaves Ripple and industry with no crypto legal precedent set",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-sec-letter-crypto-not-securities?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

It’s going to be really, really hard; you’re not going to have the same push and pull,” she said.The Trump administration has floated the idea of handing the reins of crypto regulation to the CFTC in the past.

2025-05-28T02:11:48.000Z,"Real-world assets could revitalize dying NFT lending market: DappRadar","Real-world assets linking up with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is one of a few key catalysts that could reignite the waning NFT lending sector, which is suffering from a collapse in volumes and user activity, says blockchain analytics platform DappRadar.Volumes in the NFT lending market, which allows NFT holders to take out a loan against their token, have dropped 97% from a peak of around $1 billion in January 2024 to $50 million in May, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a May 27 report.Gherghelas said for NFT lending to “move beyond survival mode,” it needs “new catalysts” to reignite the sector, such as real-world asset NFTs, like tokenized real estate or yield-bearing assets that could unlock more stable, trusted collateral sources.“So far, 2025 has not delivered a compelling reason for NFT lending to bounce back,” she said. “While the infrastructure is still here and the platforms remain active, activity has slowed across the board.” Borrower and leading activity have taken a big hit in the NFT lending sector. Source: DappRadar“For now, the sector seems to be in a holding pattern, waiting either for market recovery or a new use case to reignite interest.”Gherghelas added that other catalysts that could rekindle NFT lending were tools that make it easier for NFT holders to borrow against their tokens, and that protocols should create “smart infrastructure” such as undercollateralized loans, credit scores and artificial intelligence risk matching.The report adds that since January last year, borrower activity has declined by 90% and those willing to lend have shrunk by 78%.The average NFT loan size has also taken a hit from a peak of $22,000 in 2022 to $4,000 in May, a 71% year-over-year drop.Gherghelas said this shift “shows that either users are borrowing against lower-value assets or simply becoming more conservative with leverage.”NFT lending overall trading volume and market activity have dropped off from the all-time highs of past years. Source: DappRadarThe average loan duration is also lower; after hitting an average of roughly 40 days in 2023, it’s been down to 31 days and has held steady throughout 2024 and into 2025.Gherghelas said this could indicate that “loans are being taken more frequently but for shorter periods, perhaps a sign of more tactical liquidity plays.”NFT ﻿market downturn also hurts lendingPart of the slowdown in NFT lending is connected to the overall NFT market decline, which has seen volumes drop 61% in the first quarter to $1.5 billion compared to $4.1 billion a year ago.“With collateral value collapsing, the lending activity naturally followed,” Gherghelas said. “There are a few exceptions that managed to hold or regain traction, but they’ve been outliers, not enough to lift the sector.”Related: AI decentralized apps are coming for the Web3 throne: DappRadarThe protocol landscape has also narrowed, and the number of active NFT lending apps is limited, with only eight protocols holding any meaningful share.“The flip-for-liquidity model that worked during bull markets isn’t built for a quieter, more risk-averse environment. But that doesn’t mean NFT lending is finished; it’s simply shifting focus,” Gherghelas said.“Platforms are diversifying, use cases are shifting, and collateral preferences are changing. If the next wave builds on utility, culture, and better design, NFT lending might just find its second wind — one built to last.”Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-world-assets-revitalize-dying-nft-lending-dappradar?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

SharpLink will invest $425 million to acquire 120,000 ETH. Ethereum futures open interest hits an all-time high of $36.1 billion, with ETH price climbing 4.5% on the daily chart. Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming (SBET) announced a $425 million private investment in public equity (PIPE), acquiring approximately 69.1 million shares at $6.15 each to establish the first Nasdaq-listed Ethereum (ETH) treasury company.Spearheaded by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, this move mirrors Strategy’s (MSTR) successful Bitcoin treasury strategy, which has yielded over $8.2 billion in gains in 2025, by leveraging stock and bond sales to acquire BTC.Former Ethereum core developer and contributor Eric Conner highlighted the bullish implications of SharpLink’s move, noting its potential to create a “public ETH proxy for funds that can’t hold tokens directly.” Conner emphasized that the acquisition of 120,000 ETH—likely to be staked—could lead to “supply compression” by removing tokens from circulation. The Ether proponent also pointed to the “new narrative fuel” this provides, positioning ETH as a “digital reserve collateral” and potentially driving its adoption on mainstream balance sheets through an equity wrapper like $SBET.However, crypto analyst VICTOR cautioned against over-enthusiasm, outlining the risk of leveraging gains from an altcoin still down 19% in 2025. In Q1 2025, Cointelegraph reported a sharp decline in Ethereum network fees, dropping to $605,000 from $2.5 million in just two weeks in March, alongside a noticeable decrease in decentralized app (DApp) activity.

2025-05-27T21:52:14.000Z,"Growing BTC reserve requires Congressional legislation — VanEck exec","Building a permanent US strategic Bitcoin reserve would likely require targeted legislation rather than executive action, according to VanEck’s head of digital assets, Matthew Sigel. Speaking at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, Sigel said the most viable path forward may involve inserting Bitcoin mining incentives into the congressional budget reconciliation process.According to Sigel, the most effective path to growing a US strategic Bitcoin reserve would be through targeted amendments to congressional budget legislation. These could include tax credits for mining companies that use methane gas and other incentives aimed at encouraging miners to share a portion of their mined BTC with the federal government. He argued that such an approach would allow the reserve to grow organically over time. Sigel also highlighted the limitations of executive actions in achieving this goal:\""The problem with executive action is that it's going to prompt lawsuits. And anything over $100 million is going to get sued by the Elizabeth Warrens of the world. So, I would say start with something maybe in the Exchange Stabilization Fund for $100 million.\""US President Donald Trump established the US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve through a March 7 executive order.

FalconX, a digital asset broker, said it secured a facility worth over $100 million as part of a “broader credit framework,” while Maple Finance reportedly closed the first tranche of an agreement with Cantor.The service allows companies holding Bitcoin to borrow funds and use the cryptocurrency as collateral, providing a way to unlock liquidity without selling their BTC holdings. Cantor announced its Bitcoin financing business with an initial capital of $2 billion in July 2024, targeting institutional investors seeking to leverage their Bitcoin. At the time, the company said Anchorage Digital and Copper would serve as custodians and collateral managers in the venture.Credit markets are a fundamental part of the financial system, allowing capital to flow between borrowers and lenders and supporting economic activity across sectors. Their central role also means they can contribute to financial distress when risks are mismanaged. While mirroring some functions of traditional finance, crypto credit markets have been operating with less regulatory oversight.Digital asset crisis of 2022 This dynamic was evident during the 2022 crisis in the digital asset sector. Celsius Network, once a leading crypto lending platform, collapsed after engaging in risky financial practices and facing allegations of fraud. Similarly, BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2022 following significant exposure to the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.  According to a report from Galaxy, the total crypto lending market, including crypto-backed collateralized debt positions (CDPs) tied to stablecoins, stood at $36.5 billion in the last quarter of 2024, marking a 43% decline from its all-time high of $64.4 billion in 2021. Despite the broader contraction, onchain lending platforms have seen a dramatic rebound, with open borrowed positions surging to $19.1 billion by Q4 2024, a 959% increase over two years.

The macroeconomic-focused Bitcoin newsletter highlighted that the National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) shows a rapid shift to ultra-loose territory after a tightening phase in February 2025. The NFCI, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, tracks stress in the financial system by aggregating measures like credit spreads, leverage, and funding conditions.

2025-05-27T15:40:00.000Z,"93% of all Bitcoin is already mined. Here’s what that means","How much Bitcoin is left to mine?              Bitcoin’s total supply is hardcoded at 21 million BTC, a fixed upper limit that cannot be altered without a consensus-breaking change to the protocol. This finite cap is enforced at the protocol level and is central to Bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset.As of May 2025, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoin (BTC) have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created, and those remaining coins will be mined very slowly.The reason for this uneven distribution is Bitcoin’s exponential issuance schedule, governed by an event called the halving. When Bitcoin launched in 2009, the block reward was 50 BTC. Every 210,000 blocks — or approximately every four years — that reward is cut in half. Because the early rewards were so large, over 87% of the total supply was mined by the end of 2020. Each subsequent halving sharply reduces the rate of new issuance, meaning it will take over a century to mine the remaining 6.7%.According to current estimates, 99% of all Bitcoin will have been mined by 2035, but the final fraction — the last satoshis — won’t be produced until around the year 2140 due to the nature of geometric reward reduction.This engineered scarcity, combined with an immutable supply cap, is what draws comparisons between Bitcoin and physical commodities like gold. But Bitcoin is even more predictable: Gold’s supply grows at around 1.7% annually, whereas Bitcoin’s issuance rate is transparently declining.Did you know? Bitcoin’s supply curve is not terminal in the traditional sense. It follows an asymptotic trajectory — a kind of economic Zeno’s paradox — where rewards diminish indefinitely but never truly reach zero. Mining will continue until around 2140, by which point over 99.999% of the total 21 million BTC will have been issued.                  Beyond the supply cap: How lost coins make Bitcoin scarcer than you think              While over 93% of Bitcoin’s total supply has been mined, that doesn’t mean it’s all available. A significant portion is permanently out of circulation, lost due to forgotten passwords, misplaced wallets, destroyed hard drives or early adopters who never touched their coins again.Estimates from firms like Chainalysis and Glassnode suggest that between 3.0 million and 3.8 million BTC — roughly 14%-18% of the total supply — is likely gone for good. That includes high-profile dormant addresses like the one believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, which alone holds over 1.1 million BTC.This means Bitcoin’s true circulating supply may be closer to 16 million-17 million, not 21 million. And because Bitcoin is non-recoverable by design, any lost coins stay lost — permanently reducing supply over time.Now compare that to gold. Around 85% of the world’s total gold supply has been mined — approximately 216,265 metric tons, according to the World Gold Council — but nearly all of it remains in circulation or held in vaults, jewelry, ETFs and central banks. Gold can be remelted and reused; Bitcoin cannot be resurrected once access is lost.This distinction gives Bitcoin a kind of hardening scarcity, a supply that not only stops growing over time but quietly shrinks.As Bitcoin matures, it’s entering a monetary phase similar to gold: low issuance, high holder concentration and increasing demand-side sensitivity. But Bitcoin takes it further; its supply cap is hard, its loss rate is permanent, and its distribution is publicly auditable.This may lead to several outcomes:Increased price volatility as available supply becomes more limited and sensitive to market demandHigher long-term value concentration in the hands of those who remain active and secure in their key managementA premium on liquidity, where actually spendable BTC trades at a higher effective value than dormant supply.In extreme cases, this could produce a bifurcation between “circulating BTC” and “unreachable BTC,” with the former gaining greater economic significance, particularly in times of constrained exchange liquidity or macroeconomic stress.                  What happens when Bitcoin is fully mined?              There’s a popular assumption that as Bitcoin’s block rewards shrink, the network’s security will eventually suffer. But in practice, the mining economy is far more adaptive — and much more resilient — than that.Bitcoin’s mining incentives are governed by a self-correcting feedback loop: If mining becomes unprofitable, miners drop off the network, which in turn triggers a difficulty adjustment. Every 2,016 blocks (roughly every two weeks), the network recalibrates mining difficulty using a parameter known as nBits. The goal is to keep block times steady at around 10 minutes, regardless of how many miners are competing.So, if Bitcoin’s price drops, or the reward becomes too small relative to operating costs, inefficient miners simply exit. This causes difficulty to fall, lowering the cost for those who remain. The result is a system that continually rebalances itself, aligning network participation with available incentives.This mechanism has already been tested at scale. After China banned mining in mid-2021, Bitcoin’s global hashrate dropped by more than 50% in a matter of weeks. Yet the network continued to function without interruption, and within a few months, the hashrate fully recovered, as miners resumed operations in jurisdictions with lower energy costs and more favorable regulations.Critically, the idea that lower rewards will inherently threaten network security overlooks how mining is tied to profit margins, not nominal BTC amounts. As long as the market price supports the cost of hash power — even at 0.78125 BTC per block (post-2028 halving) or lower — miners will continue to secure the network.In other words, it’s not the absolute reward that matters, but whether mining remains profitable relative to costs. And thanks to Bitcoin’s built-in difficulty adjustment, it usually does.Even a century from now, when the block reward approaches zero, the network will likely still be protected by whatever combination of fees, base incentives and infrastructure efficiency exists at that time. But that’s a distant concern. In the meantime, the current system — hashrate adjusts, difficulty rebalances, miners adapt — remains one of the most robust elements of Bitcoin’s design.Did you know? On April 20, 2024, following the launch of the Runes protocol, Bitcoin miners earned over $80 million in transaction fees within a single day, surpassing the $26 million earned from block rewards. This marked the first time in Bitcoin’s history that transaction fees alone exceeded the block subsidy in daily miner revenue.                  The future of Bitcoin mining: Energy consumption              It’s a common misconception that rising Bitcoin prices will drive endless energy use. In reality, mining is constrained by profitability, not price alone.As block rewards shrink, miners are pushed toward thinner margins, and that means chasing the cheapest, cleanest energy available. Since China’s 2021 mining ban, hashrate has migrated to regions like North America and Northern Europe, where operators tap into surplus hydro, wind and underutilized grid energy.According to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, between 52% and 59% of Bitcoin mining now runs on renewables or low-emission sources. Regulations are reinforcing this trend, with several jurisdictions offering incentives for clean-powered mining or penalizing fossil-fuel operations.Moreover, the idea that higher BTC prices will always mean higher energy use misses how Bitcoin self-regulates: More miners raise difficulty, which compresses margins, capping energy expansion. Renewable-based mining brings its own challenges, but the dystopian future of endlessly expanding fossil-fueled hash power is increasingly unlikely.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/93-of-all-bitcoin-is-already-mined-heres-what-that-means?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T15:00:00.000Z,"ZKPs can prove I&#039;m old enough without telling you my age","Opinion by: Andre Omietanski, General Counsel, and Amal Ibraymi, Legal Counsel at Aztec LabsWhat if you could prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthday, name, or anything else at all? Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) make this hypothetical a reality and solve one of the key challenges online: verifying age without sacrificing privacy. The need for better age verification todayWe're witnessing an uptick in laws being proposed restricting minors' access to social media and the internet, including in Australia, Florida, and China. To protect minors from inappropriate adult content, platform owners and governments often walk a tightrope between inaction and overreach. For example, the state of Louisiana in the US recently enacted a law meant to block minors from viewing porn. Sites required users to upload an ID before viewing content. The Free Speech Coalition challenged the law as unconstitutional, making the case that it infringed on First Amendment rights. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed on procedural grounds. The reaction, however, highlights the dilemma facing policymakers and platforms: how to block minors without violating adults' rights or creating new privacy risks.Traditional age verification failsCurrent age verification tools are either ineffective or invasive. Self-declaration is meaningless, since users can simply lie about their age. ID-based verification is overly invasive. No one should be required to upload their most sensitive documents, putting themselves at risk of data breaches and identity theft. Biometric solutions like fingerprints and face scans are convenient for users but raise important ethical, privacy, and security concerns. Biometric systems are not always accurate and may generate false positives and negatives. The irreversible nature of the data, which can't be changed like a regular password can, is also less than ideal. Other methods, like behavioral tracking and AI-driven verification of browser patterns, are also problematic, using machine learning to analyze user interactions and identify patterns and anomalies, raising concerns of a surveillance culture.ZKPs as the privacy-preserving solutionZero-knowledge proofs present a compelling solution. Like a government ID provider, a trusted entity verifies the user's age and generates a cryptographic proof confirming they are over the required age. Websites only need to check the proof, not the excess personal data, ensuring privacy while keeping minors at the gates. No centralized data storage is required, alleviating the burden on platforms such as Google, Meta, and WhatsApp and eliminating the risk of data breaches. Recent: How zero-knowledge proofs can make AI fairerAdopting and enforcing ZKPs at scaleZKPs aren't a silver bullet. They can be complex to implement. The notion of \""don't trust, verify,\"" proven by indisputable mathematics, may cause some regulatory skepticism. Policymakers may hesitate to trust cryptographic proofs over visible ID verification. There are occasions when companies may need to disclose personal information to authorities, such as during an investigation into financial crimes or government inquiries. This would challenge ZKPs, whose very intention is for platforms not to hold this data in the first place.ZKPs also struggle with scalability and performance, being somewhat computationally intensive and tricky to program. Efficient implementation techniques are being explored, and breakthroughs, such as the Noir programming language, are making ZKPs more accessible to developers, driving the adoption of secure, privacy-first solutions. A safer, smarter future for age verificationGoogle's move to adopt ZKPs for age verification is a promising signal that mainstream platforms are beginning to embrace privacy-preserving technologies. But to fully realize the potential of ZKPs, we need more than isolated solutions locked into proprietary ecosystems. Crypto-native wallets can go further. Open-source and permissionless blockchain-based systems offer interoperability, composability, and programmable identity. With a single proof, users can access a range of services across the open web — no need to start from scratch every time, or trust a single provider (Google) with their credentials.ZKPs flip the script on online identity — proving what matters, without exposing anything else. They protect user privacy, help platforms stay compliant, and block minors from restricted content, all without creating new honeypots of sensitive data.Google's adoption of ZKPs shows mainstream momentum is building. But to truly transform digital identity, we must embrace crypto-native, decentralized systems that give users control over what they share and who they are online.In an era defined by surveillance, ZKPs offer a better path forward — one that's secure, private, and built for the future.Opinion by: Andre Omietanski, General Counsel, and Amal Ibraymi, Legal Counsel at Aztec Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-27T14:30:00.000Z,"What is a cryptocurrency mixer and how does it work?","Cryptocurrency mixers explained              A cryptocurrency mixer is a specialized service designed to increase the privacy and anonymity of blockchain transactions. Unlike traditional financial transactions, which are private by default, most cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) operate on public blockchains. This means every transaction is permanently recorded and accessible to anyone, making it possible for blockchain analysts or malicious actors to trace the flow of funds between wallets.A crypto mixer’s primary function is to break the link between the sender’s wallet and the recipient’s wallet. It does so by pooling together coins from many users and then redistributing them in a way that makes it difficult to track which coins went where. Think of it like a digital version of shuffling cards in a deck. After mixing, your cryptocurrency is returned to you or a recipient’s address, but it’s “cleaned” of any direct transaction history.This privacy-enhancing feature is why some people rely on mixers, especially those seeking to keep their financial activities confidential in an open-ledger world.                  How does a crypto mixer work?              To understand a crypto mixer, it’s useful to compare it to the concept of money laundering in traditional finance, albeit with legal and ethical nuances. The process of “mixing” is essentially designed to obscure the origin and destination of coins.Here’s a typical workflow of how a cryptocurrency mixer operates:Deposit: You send your cryptocurrency to the mixer’s wallet address. Multiple users do the same, creating a large pool of coins.Mixing/shuffling: The mixer’s system pools and shuffles these coins together, breaking any visible connection between deposited and withdrawn funds.Redistribution: After mixing, the service sends back an equivalent amount of coins to your specified address, but these aren’t the same coins you deposited. They come from the pooled coins of all participants.Fees: The mixer usually deducts a small fee, generally ranging from 1% to 3%, to cover operational costs.This process effectively disrupts blockchain analysis, making it extremely difficult for anyone to trace the coins back to their original owners.                  Types of cryptocurrency mixers              Not all mixers are created equal. They can broadly be divided into two categories: centralized and decentralized mixers.Centralized mixersCentralized mixers are the most common and operate similarly to traditional services. You send your coins to a company or entity that controls the mixing process, and then they send back “clean” coins after mixing. These services are relatively easy to use, often providing a simple user interface.However, centralized mixers require you to trust the service operator with your coins, at least temporarily. This introduces risks such as:The mixer could be a scam and disappear with your funds.It could be hacked, exposing users’ data and coins.The operator may keep logs that could compromise your privacy.Decentralized mixersDecentralized mixers use blockchain technology and smart contracts to automate the mixing process without a trusted third party. They rely on cryptographic methods such as zero-knowledge proofs to mix coins in a trustless environment. Users pool their coins into a smart contract, which then redistributes coins in a way that ensures privacy.Advantages of decentralized mixers include:No central point of failure or custody risk.Higher privacy because no single party controls the funds.Often more resistant to regulatory crackdowns.Did you know? The DOJ indicted four Russians for operating crypto mixers Blender.io and Sinbad.io, yet failed to show they knowingly laundered illicit funds. The indictment relies heavily on vague forum posts and lacks concrete evidence of criminal intent or ties to US commerce, raising serious doubts about its strength in court.                  Real-world cases involving mixers and scams              Unfortunately, the privacy offered by crypto mixers has also attracted criminals. The very anonymity that protects innocent users can also shield illicit activities, leading to widespread misuse.Crypto mixers have been linked to ransomware attacks, dark web marketplaces, fraud and drug trafficking. Criminals often use these services to “clean” proceeds from illegal transactions and hide their tracks from law enforcement.A notable example is ChipMixer, a service seized by Europol in 2023 for allegedly facilitating money laundering for dark web markets and ransomware groups. Authorities dismantled the platform’s infrastructure over alleged money laundering, seizing four servers, 1,909.4 BTC (about $210 million as of May 26, 2025) and seven TB of data across 55 transactions.Mixers have also been involved in laundering stolen funds from cryptocurrency exchange hacks. The complexity of these transactions makes it difficult for investigators to recover stolen assets.In February 2025, Bybit, a major cryptocurrency exchange, suffered a significant security breach resulting in the theft of about $1.5 billion worth of cryptocurrencies. The attackers, attributed to the Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking organization, employed various crypto mixers, including Wasabi, CryptoMixer, Railgun and Tornado Cash, to launder portions of the stolen assets. Despite efforts to trace the funds, a significant portion remains unaccounted for, highlighting the challenges posed by mixers in cybersecurity investigations.                  Are crypto mixers legal?              The legal status of cryptocurrency mixers depends largely on the jurisdiction and context of their use.Most governments impose strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing regulations on financial services, including digital currency services. Mixers, by their nature, complicate AML compliance because they obscure transaction trails.For instance,In the European Union, the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD) includes digital currency providers under its regulatory scope, requiring them to perform KYC checks and report suspicious activity.In the United States, FinCEN classifies cryptocurrency mixers as money transmitters, requiring registration and compliance with AML regulations. Unlicensed mixers can face severe penalties and criminal charges.Legal uses vs misuseUsing a mixer for privacy reasons is not inherently illegal. However, if mixers are used to launder proceeds from crimes, authorities will prosecute offenders. Similarly, operating a mixer without appropriate licenses or regulatory oversight can be illegal.If you choose to use a mixer, make sure you understand the legal implications in your country and avoid any activity that could be linked to money laundering or fraud.Did you know? Crypto mixer transactions are still taxable. Using a mixer doesn’t hide gains from tax authorities; failing to report them can trigger audits or penalties. Always keep records and understand your local tax obligations.                  How to stay safe and avoid scam-linked mixers              If you decide to use a cryptocurrency mixer, your safety and security should be paramount. Here are some essential tips to avoid scams and legal troubles:Choose reputable mixers: Conduct thorough research. Look for mixers with good reviews, transparent operations and clear compliance policies.Avoid unknown or suspicious services: Steer clear of mixers linked to scams, hacks or regulatory actions.Check for licensing and compliance: Prefer mixers that comply with AML/KYC regulations, especially if you are a business or high-value user.Understand fees and timelines: Be clear on the fees involved and the expected time for your funds to be returned after mixing.Use hardware wallets and strong security practices: Always safeguard your private keys and use hardware wallets to minimize risks.Stay updated on regulations: Laws surrounding crypto mixers evolve rapidly. Staying informed will help you avoid inadvertent legal violations.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-mixer-and-how-does-it-work?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

With thousands of projects emerging or disappearing, you need innovative ways to separate signal from noise. AI solutions such as ChatGPT and Grok could benefit you as your research assistant, reducing research time and delivering actionable information. This article discusses how to use both platforms to make better decisions regarding investment in altcoins.How to share content with ChatGPT and GrokBoth ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 allow you to share content in three ways. You can simply paste content in the text box with inverted commas and write your prompt. Alternatively, you can upload a document from your local drive or Google Drive on ChatGPT 4o. If you are working with Grok 3, you could upload a file from your local drive or connect a file on Google Drive and Microsoft Drive to the AI platform.On both ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3, you can paste a link in the text box and write a prompt for the AI engine.Use ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 to analyze complex data and draw quick conclusionsChatGPT 4o excels at processing and simplifying extensive and often fragmented information. Altcoin projects tend to have extensive white papers and technical documentation. It takes time to get through all the information, analyze it, and draw conclusions. With ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3, you can easily get the information you need without spending hours reading the content. You can use the AI platforms for:Summarizing extensive documentation: You could get a quick summary of vast information that might go into thousands of words, using a prompt like “Summarize this document in plain English with pros, cons and use cases.”Analyzing tokenomics: You could ask the AI platforms for the altcoin project’s breakdown of inflation, token distribution and staking models. For example, you could use a prompt such as “Explain the tokenomics of [Altcoin Name] and its impact on price.” Deconstructing roadmaps: Projects often publish unrealistic roadmaps that are hard to implement. AI platforms could quickly analyze the relevancy of roadmaps and suggest to you what you could expect of them. You could use prompts like, “What are the most realistic milestones in this roadmap for 2025?”Spotting red flags: The goal is not just to understand but to spot red flags, such as overpromising, vague goals or lack of technical updates. Did you know? ChatGPT is trained on vast crypto data sets and can explain trends, decode memes, or simplify DeFi tools — even if you are just starting your crypto learning journey.Ask for competitive comparisons on ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 can be valuable tools for quickly comparing different cryptocurrency projects. To begin with, state the names of the cryptocurrencies you want to compare. Also mention the criteria such as use case, consensus process, tokenomics and development activities. For example, you can use the prompt, “Create a table comparing Solana and Avalanche in terms of transaction speed, fees and developer adoption.” Here is a response from ChatGPT 4o:And this is Grok 3’s response for the same prompt:AI tools typically use tables or bullet points for an answer. You can also ask additional questions to delve deeper into topics like security, scalability and partnerships. This allows for more efficient evaluation of many projects without the need to search through multiple sources.To get a market-layer view on ChatGPT 4o, you can use the prompt: “Create a table of five layer-1 altcoins with higher throughput than Ethereum and evaluate their adoption metrics.” Here is the output of ChatGPT 4o:Grok 3 gave the following response using the same prompt:These comparisons help you map out where each altcoin stands relative to its peers and whether it offers a genuine edge.Did you know? Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot was built with a rebellious tone. It excels at quickly pulling crypto insights directly from social chatter, perfect for memecoin hunters.Find info about developer activityDeveloper traction is a dependable indicator of an altcoin’s long-term potential. Use ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 to find information about overall growth in development activity, surges after certain upgrades, developer count and contributions, commit activity, network upgrades and challenges before developers.You could use prompts like:“What has been the developer activity trend on [Project ] over the last 6 months?”You can also request ecosystem breakdowns with prompts like:“List top DeFi projects built on Arbitrum with TVL over $10 million.”ChatGPT 4o generated the following response for this prompt:Here is Grok 3’s response for the same prompt:ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 can synthesize data points from multiple sources and give you a cleaner picture faster than manual web browsing. You could track sudden price spikes with a prompt like:“In 100 words, write why is $RNDR trending right now?”Here is ChatGPT 4o’s response for this prompt:This is Grok 3’s response for the same prompt:Grok 3 is particularly useful for monitoring real-time sentiment and news. Grok 3 is ideal for real-time analysis of trends, especially on X, where crypto narratives form quickly. Grok 3 will pull recent posts, mentions and news threads to explain the momentum. It can monitor influencer sentiment.For deeper and quicker research, you can use ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 together.Don’t just trust the bots — verify the alphaAI tools like ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 offer powerful support in the altcoin research process, enabling faster analysis, broader comparisons and streamlined access to information. However, even advanced AI models can occasionally misinterpret data or miss contextual nuances. As such, it is essential to treat their responses as a starting point — not a final answer.When using these tools, take the time to compare outputs, evaluate the sources referenced, and cross-check insights against real-world data. Discrepancies between ChatGPT and Grok responses should prompt further investigation, not automatic preference.Ultimately, these platforms are most effective when used to enhance critical thinking and research efficiency rather than replace human judgment.In a fast-moving industry like Web3, effective research requires diligence, curiosity and verification. By applying these principles, you can make more confident and informed investment decisions in the altcoin space.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-27T12:00:15.000Z,"StarkWare launches mobile-friendly zero-knowledge prover","Blockchain company StarkWare has unveiled zero-knowledge (ZK) prover STARK Two (S-two), enabling enhanced privacy and verification on everyday devices like phones, laptops and browsers. The company said the new ZK prover allows users to generate complex cryptographic proofs from the client side. This means users can generate ZK-proofs directly on their devices instead of relying on a server or cloud infrastructure, opening the door for faster and more private applications across the internet. “S-two will bring STARK proving to everyday devices, and open the door for new real-world proving use cases,” said Eli Ben-Sasson, StarkWare co-founder and CEO, adding that the tool could empower the next wave of ZK applications. The company said the ZK prover is now available in public alpha and is set to roll out on Starknet, its Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, later this year.  StarkWare says new ZK prover is 39 times faster than old solutions StarkWare said that benchmark tests for the S-two ZK prover showed that it was 39 times faster than previous solutions. The performance leap enables smoother experiences in privacy-enhancing applications. The upgrade also allows use cases in private transactions, ZK-based identity and verifiable artificial intelligence. StarkWare said S-two runs on CPUs, GPUs and will soon be on browsers. “For years we’ve called the prover our magic wand, a tool that transforms complex computation into a simple proof,” Ben-Sasson said. “Now, the wand has become a lightsaber in your pocket, something anyone can wield, instantly, from your own device.”According to StarkWare, developers can build with S-two, adding that its alpha release supports hardware targets. Furthermore, the company said ZK ecosystem participants like Kakarot, Nexus, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs have already adopted the technology. Kakarot uses S-two inside ETHProofs to generate Ethereum block proofs more efficiently, while Nexus is standardizing RISC-V traces to align with S-two’s architecture. Meanwhile, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs are adding GPU acceleration to push the prover’s performance even further.Use cases for S-two zero-knowledge proverStarkWare chief operating officer Oren Katz told Cointelegraph that S-two marks a shift in how ZK-proofs are used in daily lives. Generating validity proofs directly in devices will allow privacy-preserving features in messaging, payments and digital identity. “You can prove a payment was valid without showing your balance, or verify identity without revealing personal details,” Katz added. Katz said that even salary payments could be made onchain with full transparency and no exposure of sensitive information. He dubbed the development a “big step toward bringing zero-knowledge tech into the mainstream.”Beyond privacy, Katz said, local proof generation also unlocks use cases in other industries. The executive told Cointelegraph that it can allow gamers to play offline and later generate cryptographic proof of their achievements. “An operator, instead of running all logic onchain to prove integrity, can run it on their own servers and simply generate a proof that it was executed correctly,” Katz added.Related: Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden’s cashless-society rethinkNew ZK prover follows Ethereum’s privacy pushThe launch of StarWare’s upgraded ZK prover follows Ethereum’s push for better privacy. On April 11, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin published a roadmap that addressed privacy enhancements for wallets, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and infrastructure. Buterin advocated implementing privacy-enhancing norms and features across the Ethereum ecosystem, including adding privacy tools in ETH wallets. Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/starkware-unveils-s-two-client-side-zk-prover?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

According to a Pendle report, yield-bearing stablecoins climbed from $1.5 billion at the start of 2024 to $11 billion as of May 21. This represents 4.5% of the entire stablecoin market. The growth of yield-bearing stablecoins is attributed to increasing regulatory clarity in the United States under President Donald Trump’s administration. According to a Feb. 18 filing, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved exchange operator Figure Markets’ interest-bearing stablecoin. This made the company the first to receive US approval for a yield-bearing stablecoin. Apart from a favorable response from the SEC, proposed bills like the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) also signal a positive direction for stablecoins in the US. Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitget-enters-real-world-asset-race-with-yield-bearing-bgusd-stablecoin?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T08:45:00.000Z,"How central banks are testing blockchain-based monetary policy","Why are central banks looking at blockchains?              Central banks are tiptoeing into the world of blockchain not because it is fashionable but because every part of the money-making machine, from settlement rails to asset custody, is slowly being rewritten as code.The financial industry is already tokenizing money-market funds, Treasurys and even bank deposits. According to the Atlantic Council, 134 jurisdictions are studying or piloting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), up from just 35 in 2020. Meanwhile, commercial banks have begun to warn that if they cannot move tokenized deposits across public blockchains such as Solana or private ledgers like R3 Corda, they risk being left behind.From a central bank’s vantage point, two questions matter:First, can traditional operations, such as open-market purchases, standing facilities and reserve remuneration still work if reserves and government bonds become smart tokens? Second, can monetary transmission improve when policy logic is hard-wired into code? These questions motivate pilots such as Project Pine, Project Guardian in Singapore, the Bank of England’s wholesale CBDC sandbox and Japan’s multiyear retail CBDC pilot.                  What is “tokenized” monetary policy?              Tokenized monetary policy means that the liabilities and assets a central bank uses to steer short-term interest rates exist as programmable tokens on a distributed-ledger platform. In such a token arrangement, what the BIS describes as an ecosystem where money and securities share a common ledger, monetary functions are executed by smart contracts, replacing the traditional batch file processes used in overnight real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems.In practice, each policy tool is expressed as code:Interest on reserves becomes an automated coupon that accrues to a wallet address once a block closes.Repo and reverse-repo agreements become conditional asset swaps that self-liquidate at maturity.Collateral haircuts are numeric parameters the central bank can toggle in real time, with changes propagating instantly to all counterparties.Project Pine demonstrated all three, using ERC-20 tokens for reserves and securities on a permissioned Ethereum-compatible chain.But how is tokenized monetary policy different from traditional monetary policy?Traditional policy operations rely on central bank systems such as Fedwire or the Bank of England’s RTGS. These systems close overnight, settle in discrete batches and require multiple human sign-offs. A tokenized system settles atomically in seconds, keeps an immutable audit trail and lets policy adjustments propagate without waiting for dealers to book trades. The BIS paper on tokenisation notes that combining assets and settlement on a single ledger can shrink operational risk and latency.Did you know? A repo is a short-term secured loan in which one party sells securities and agrees to repurchase them later at a higher price. In contrast, a reverse repo is the same transaction viewed from the counterparty’s perspective (buying the securities and later reselling them).                  What is Project Pine?              Project Pine is a research initiative led by the BIS Innovation Hub and the New York Fed that explores how central banks could run monetary policy in a future where money and government securities are digital tokens managed on blockchain-like systems.Launched in late 2024 and published in May 2025, the project built a working prototype, a “starter kit” for central banks, designed to test whether tools like interest on reserves, repo operations and asset purchases can be run using smart contracts.The project ran simulated financial scenarios, mimicking both calm and crisis conditions:Normal conditions: The smart contract automatically conducted a one-day reverse-repo, draining reserves by posting bids at a pre-set interest rate.Liquidity shock: When simulated market stress pushed interest rates too high, an emergency lending facility kicked in automatically, within seconds, helping stabilize rates.Asset-purchase program: The toolkit accepted bids, calculated allocations and settled trades between digital reserves and tokenized bonds instantly.These scenarios were run in a test environment with simulated commercial banks and a programmable blockchain platform. Everything from interest payments to collateral valuation was automated, providing a glimpse into how monetary policy might function in a 24/7, tokenized financial system.This was not an isolated experiment. Other central banks are running parallel pilots that explore similar ground with their distinct approaches:Although temporarily offline as of May 24, 2025, MAS news releases show that Singapore’s Project Guardian has tested tokenized deposits and government bonds in live repo transactions, proving that interbank settlement can occur on a shared DLT without sending payments through Swift.Meanwhile, the Bank of England has taken a dual-rail approach. A July 2024 discussion paper stresses that wholesale tokenized money could sit alongside RTGS balances, letting commercial banks pick whichever rail meets their liquidity needs. Governor Andrew Bailey has warned that if tokenized deposits stall, the Bank “must continue to prepare for a wholesale CBDC.”On the retail front, Japan’s multi-year programme has entered a live “pilot” phase, constructing an end-to-end infrastructure, from smartphone wallets to a central ledger, capable of handling tens of thousands of transactions per second. The pilot also explores privacy-enhancing overlays, reflecting consumer expectations for cash-like anonymity.Taken together, these pilots confirm that key features like programmability, real-time visibility, and atomic settlement are no longer theoretical — they work. They don’t yet answer the more challenging question: How do central banks transition an entire financial system to such rails without disrupting credit creation and intermediation?Did you know? Project Pine’s digital monetary system is built like a three-layer cake: The bottom layer is a programmable blockchain (Besu), the middle is packed with tokenized money and assets (like ERC-20 reserves) and the top layer runs the smart contracts that carry out monetary policy actions.                  Why is Project Pine important?              Project Pine is the first of its kind to show that core central bank tools could be rebuilt using smart contracts. It proves that:Policy tools can be deployed faster, possibly within seconds.Facilities like repo or asset purchases can adapt automatically to changing market conditions.Tokenization could streamline operations, reduce friction and offer greater flexibility.Who was involved in Project Pine experiments?Seven major central banks, including those of Australia, Canada, England, Mexico, Switzerland, the EU and the US, collaborated on shaping the toolkit and defining test requirements. The findings don’t commit any of these banks to adopt such systems, but they provide a solid foundation for future research and policymaking.What did Project Pine test?To see how well the system works, Project Pine ran tests based on real-world situations, such as raising interest rates or a government debt crisis. They tried short and long periods, small and large financial systems, tight and loose money conditions and different ways of lending (like bank loans or corporate bonds). This helped check if the system could handle all kinds of economic ups and downs.Did you know? In Project Pine, central bank operations like paying interest on reserves or managing collateral aren’t done manually; they're handled by smart contracts coded directly into the top “protocol layer” of the blockchain stack.                  Practical design challenges in tokenized monetary policy              As central banks explore moving policy tools onto blockchains, they face several significant design hurdles. These aren’t just technical. They’re legal, operational and even philosophical. Here are the key ones:Interoperability: Can different blockchains talk to each other? Today’s financial system is like a highway with shared rules. However, blockchain ecosystems are more like separate islands, each with its own rules and roads. Public networks like Solana, private ones like Corda, or permissioned platforms like Besu don’t always “talk” to each other smoothly. This can cause issues like payment delays or funds getting stuck between platforms. Experts also warn that if too many users gather around one dominant blockchain, it could create unhealthy concentration, making the whole system more fragile.Legal finality: Does blockchain data legally count? Many countries still treat blockchain records as transaction evidence, not legally binding proof of ownership. So, even if a tokenized treasury bond moves onchain, the law might still require a separate “golden record” kept offchain by a trusted authority. Until legal systems catch up, this split could limit how far tokenized finance can go.Cyber resilience: What happens when something goes wrong? Blockchain systems run on code, and that code can have bugs. In a traditional setup, if something breaks, humans can step in. But with smart contracts, “code is law.” That’s why countries like Japan are building complete backup plans into their pilots. They’re testing how to respond to cyberattacks, technical failures or even smart contract glitches because in a digital money system, even a small error could have significant consequences.Privacy vs transparency: How much should be visible? Banks and regulators need transparency to monitor financial risks and prevent crime. But regular people want privacy, especially when using money for everyday purchases. Balancing those two needs is tricky. Policymakers are now experimenting with ideas like tiered disclosure (more visibility for big transactions), zero-knowledge proofs (which let you prove something without revealing all details), and even “anonymity vouchers” that let users make some transactions without being tracked.These challenges aren’t deal-breakers, but they do show that making money programmable isn’t as simple as flipping a switch. Central banks must work closely with lawmakers, cybersecurity experts and the financial industry to ensure tokenized monetary systems are safe, fair and reliable.                  The road ahead              The future of tokenized monetary policy will likely unfold in carefully staged phases, balancing innovation with financial stability.The BIS Innovation Hub lists more than a dozen ongoing tokenization projects from Australia’s Project Dunbar (multi-CBDC bridge) to Switzerland’s Project Helvetia (DLT-based repo). Commercial banks, meanwhile, are shifting rails: HSBC settled its first tokenized-deposit payment in April 2025, and Euroclear is piloting blockchain settlement for tokenized bonds.Central banks face a coordination game: Go slow and risk private standards hardening around them; go too fast and upend the funding model of commercial banks. The likeliest path is a phased approach:Stage 1: Limited-scope wholesale CBDC sandboxes plus tokenized collateral for central-bank counterparties.Stage 2: Dual-rail environments where RTGS balances and tokenized reserves interoperate via synchronization layers.Stage 3: Full adoption of smart-contract-based policy tools, possibly including real-time fiscal transfers.Just as earlier shifts like the rollout of RTGS systems or inflation-targeting regimes were introduced gradually to test and refine their impact, tokenized systems will be phased in through pilots, sandboxes and hybrid models before full-scale adoption.Whether it ultimately reshapes how central banks manage the economy remains to be seen.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-central-banks-are-testing-blockchain-based-monetary-policy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The initiative, currently under review by the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Thailand, will enable tourists to link their crypto holdings to credit cards for local purchases.Merchants will receive Thai baht as usual, often without knowing crypto was used in the transaction. The pilot is expected to roll out after key infrastructure and regulatory checks are in place.“This approach can be immediately adapted for Thailand, provided the supporting systems are in place,” said Pichai, noting that the model avoids using the Thai baht directly, reducing risks to the domestic currency.Related: Crypto exchange KuCoin enters crowded Thailand marketCapital markets regulation under reviewBeyond enabling crypto use for tourism, Thailand is also planning a reform of its financial laws.

As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave.However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation.This caused the long-term holder realized capitalization to surge past $28 billion, a level not seen since April. Realized cap is a measure of the value of each Bitcoin based on the last time it was moved, rather than the current market price.Long-term investors are using this period of forced selling to increase their exposure and accumulate more Bitcoin for the long run, Amr Taha noted. “This strategic accumulation during moments of market stress reflects the deep conviction of LTHs.”“Rather than being shaken out by short-term volatility, they [LTH] see these liquidation-driven dips as prime opportunities to strengthen their positions, reinforcing the foundation for future price appreciation.”BTC short-term holders (red) and long-term holders (green) net realized cap.

Gox, but said proof-of-reserves isn’t the correct measure to take for institutions.“No institutional-grade or enterprise security analyst would think it’s a good idea to publish all of the wallet addresses, such that you could be traced back and forth.”“Go to AI, put it in deep think mode and then ask it ‘what are the security problems of publishing your wallet addresses?’ and ‘how might it undermine the security of your company over time,” Saylor said, adding it would write “50 pages of security problems.”Proof-of-reserves increasingly adopted after FTX collapseMany crypto exchanges, custodians and exchange-traded fund issuers started publishing their proof-of-reserves following FTX’s collapse in November 2022 to establish transparency and prove that they hold enough assets to back customer deposits.Related: Strategy bags 4,020 Bitcoin as price briefly breaks $110KCrypto exchanges Binance, Kraken and OKX and crypto asset manager Bitwise are among the industry players that have adopted the transparency measure.However, Saylor noted that proof-of-reserves often only show one side of the picture — what the company holds — and not what they owe.Source: Mitchell AskewSaylor’s Strategy is the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 576,230 Bitcoin worth $62.6 million on its balance sheet, followed by Bitcoin mining firm MARA Holdings, which holds 48,137 Bitcoin, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET.More than 110 publicly traded companies worldwide have purchased and hold Bitcoin.Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/michael-saylor-says-proof-of-reserves-bad-idea?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-27T03:16:04.000Z,"Meta’s AI boss says current AI lacks ‘intelligent behavior’ — Report","Current artificial intelligence models lack the major traits of human intelligence, Meta’s AI chief has reportedly said, claiming that the firm’s latest model will solve this issue. Business Insider reported on May 26 that at the AI Action Summit in Paris earlier this year, Meta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun said that “there are four essential characteristics of intelligent behavior that every animal, or relatively smart animal, can do, and certainly humans.” “Understanding the physical world, having persistent memory, being able to reason and being able to plan complex actions, particularly planning hierarchically,” LeCun said.He said current large language models (LLMs) that power popular AI chatbots have not hit this threshold, and “incorporating these capabilities would require a shift in how they are trained.”Some of the largest AI and tech giants are “cobbling capabilities” onto existing models in their race to dominate the AI game, LeCun said.Yann LeCun speaking on LLM intelligence.

Since the world has infinite unpredictable possibilities, LeCun believes training must happen through abstraction, which mirrors how humans make sense of the physical world.Meta’s AI brain drain Meanwhile, Meta is experiencing significant talent loss from its AI research team, particularly among the researchers who created the original Llama model in 2023, Insider reported on May 26. Just three of the original 14 Llama authors remain at Meta, and many have joined Mistral, a Paris-based startup co-founded by former Meta researchers and key Llama architects. Meta’s latest release, Llama 4, received a lukewarm reception from developers, many of whom now look to faster-moving rivals that have dedicated reasoning models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o, Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, and the recently launched Claude 4 Sonnet from Anthropic, the report added. On May 15, The Wall Street Journal reported that Meta was delaying the rollout of its flagship AI LLM, Llama 4 “Behemoth.” Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/meta-ai-boss-ai-lacks-intelligent-behavior-report?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
