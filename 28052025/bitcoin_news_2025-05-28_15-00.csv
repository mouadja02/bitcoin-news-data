2025-05-28T12:50:33.000Z,"Ethereum price stalls as whales sell $530M coins: can it surge to $4,000?","Ethereum’s price has stalled this week after hitting a crucial resistance level, as on-chain data points to whale selling and declining social traction. Ethereum ( ETH ) was trading at $2,650 on Wednesday, May 28, a few points below the crucial barrier at $2,722. It remains 91% above the lowest level this year. Santiment data shows that whales have started capitulating, as their holdings fell by 200,000 coins, equivalent to $530 million. They now hold 103.52 million coins, down from 103.74 million on May 24. Ethereum’s social volume has also dropped to 476, down from this month’s high of 3,060. Falling social volume suggests that traders are not actively discussing ETH on top platforms like Telegram and X. In most cases, cryptocurrency prices rise when there are active discussions on social media. Ethereum whales and social volume | Source: Santiment Ethereum’s network is facing other challenges, particularly from its layer-2 networks. Data from growthepie , a data and insights provider across Ethereum Layer 1 and Layer 2 network, shows it had 415,000 active addresses on Tuesday, much lower than Base’s 1.93 million and Celo’s 486,000.

Base paid $112,000 in the last 30 days, down 57% from a month earlier. Arbitrum One and Optimism paid $39,000 and $13,000 respectively, both down by double digits. On the positive side, there are signs that U.S. investors are moving back into Ethereum ETFs. These funds have seen positive inflows for three consecutive weeks and are up $38 million so far this week. This increase has brought cumulative inflows to $2.8 billion, bringing total assets to $9.60 billion. Ethereum price technical analysis ETH price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that ETH price has stalled in recent weeks after finding resistance at $2,722. It has failed to break above that level, which coincides with the 50% Fibonacci retracement point, at least three times. Ethereum has formed a bullish flag-like pattern, comprising a vertical move followed by some consolidation. It is also close to forming a golden cross pattern, as the spread between the 50-day and 200-day moving averages continues to narrow. A break above the 50% retracement would point to further upside, with the next major resistance at $3,000. A move above $3,000 would raise the odds of Ethereum rallying toward the psychological level of $4,000. A drop below the support at $2,333 would invalidate the bullish outlook.

2025-05-28T12:50:28.000Z,"Bitcoin Holders Unlock Billions: On-Chain Data Reveals Surprising Activity Surge","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Holders Unlock Billions: On-Chain Data Reveals Surprising Activity Surge A fascinating shift is happening within the Bitcoin ecosystem, according to recent insights from leading on-chain analysis firm, Glassnode. Their latest report highlights a significant increase in activity from a specific cohort of investors – those who have held their Bitcoin for a considerable time, specifically between one and five years. This group, often referred to as long-term holders, has recently moved a substantial amount of BTC, sparking discussions across the crypto community. What Does the Latest On-Chain Data Reveal? Glassnode shared key findings on X, pointing out that spending by long-term Bitcoin (BTC) holders is showing a notable uptick. The data indicates that holders within the one to five year age band collectively moved a staggering $4.02 billion worth of BTC. This figure represents the highest volume of movement from this particular cohort since February of this year. This surge in BTC spending by these seasoned holders is particularly interesting because the 1-5 year age band often includes investors who acquired Bitcoin during previous market cycles, holding through periods of both significant gains and downturns. Their decision to move such a large volume of coins suggests a change in behavior compared to typical ‘HODLing’ (holding on for dear life), which has been a dominant strategy for many in this group. Understanding on-chain data is crucial here. On-chain analysis involves examining publicly available data on the Bitcoin blockchain, such as transaction volumes, wallet addresses, and holder behavior patterns. Firms like Glassnode specialize in processing this vast amount of information to provide insights into market dynamics that are not visible through price charts alone. The movement of coins, especially those that have been dormant for years, can signal shifts in investor sentiment, supply dynamics, and potential future market direction. Why Are Long-Term Holders Increasing BTC Spending? The increase in activity from this cohort prompts the question: what’s driving these long-term holders to move their Bitcoin now? Several factors could be at play, and interpreting on-chain data requires considering the broader market context. Profit-Taking: After holding for one to five years, many of these coins were likely acquired at significantly lower prices than current market levels. A rally in Bitcoin’s price could incentivize some holders to realize profits, either partially or fully. Portfolio Rebalancing: Investors may be rebalancing their portfolios, potentially rotating out of Bitcoin into other assets, or simply moving BTC to different wallets or platforms for various reasons (e.g., security, accessing DeFi protocols, preparing for potential spending). Increased Utility: As the Bitcoin ecosystem evolves, there might be more opportunities for holders to use their BTC directly for purchases, investments in decentralized finance (DeFi), or other services, reducing the need to hold static balances. Market Sentiment and Outlook: A belief that the market may be nearing a peak, or conversely, positioning for further upside by moving coins to exchanges for quicker reaction times, could also influence this behavior. It’s important to note that ‘spending’ in this context doesn’t necessarily mean selling on an exchange. It simply means the coins have moved from the address where they were held for 1-5 years. This movement could be to an exchange, a new cold storage wallet, a DeFi protocol, or even to a payment processor. The destination of the coins provides further clues, which Glassnode’s detailed reports often explore. How Does This Activity Impact Crypto Market Dynamics? Increased BTC spending by long-term holders can have several implications for overall crypto market activity . Firstly, it can increase the available supply on exchanges if the movement is directed there. A significant increase in exchange supply, especially if met with insufficient demand, could potentially put downward pressure on prices. However, if demand remains strong or increases, this supply can be absorbed without a major price drop. Secondly, the behavior of long-term holders is often seen as a key indicator of market sentiment at different stages of a cycle. Historically, significant selling by the oldest cohorts (5+ years) has sometimes coincided with market tops, while accumulation by these groups can signal conviction during downturns. The 1-5 year cohort sits in a middle ground, representing a large segment of experienced investors whose movements are closely watched. Thirdly, this activity contributes to overall market liquidity and volume. Higher transaction volumes can attract more traders and investors, potentially increasing market dynamism and volatility. Interpreting the Signals: Challenges and Nuances While on-chain data provides invaluable insights, it’s not a crystal ball. Interpreting the movement of long-term holders comes with challenges: Motivation Ambiguity: As mentioned, ‘spending’ doesn’t specify the intent (selling, rebalancing, using). Without knowing the destination and context of each transaction, the exact motivation remains speculative. Cohort Specificity: The 1-5 year cohort is broad. Behavior within this group can vary widely based on individual entry points, investment goals, and risk tolerance. Correlation vs. Causation: While increased long-term holder activity might correlate with certain market events, it doesn’t necessarily cause them directly. It’s one data point among many influencing the complex crypto market activity . Data Lag: On-chain data is real-time, but analysis and interpretation can take time, and the market might react before the full implications of the data are widely understood. Therefore, this report from Glassnode should be viewed as a significant piece of the puzzle, prompting further investigation and consideration alongside other market indicators. Actionable Insights for Investors What can investors glean from this increase in BTC spending by the 1-5 year holder cohort? Monitor On-Chain Metrics: Pay attention to reports from firms like Glassnode and others specializing in on-chain analysis. Metrics related to holder behavior, exchange flows, and transaction volumes can provide valuable context. Understand Holder Behavior: Recognize that different holder cohorts (short-term, mid-term, long-term) tend to behave differently throughout market cycles. Understanding these patterns can help anticipate potential supply and demand shifts. Consider the Broader Context: Don’t rely on a single data point. Evaluate the long-term holder activity in conjunction with price action, macroeconomic factors, news events, and other technical and fundamental indicators. Assess Your Own Strategy: Reflect on your own investment timeline and goals. Are you a long-term holder? How does your strategy align with potential shifts indicated by aggregate holder behavior? This data can inform your decisions but shouldn’t dictate them in isolation. The fact that $4.02 billion in Bitcoin held for 1-5 years has moved is a material event that warrants attention. It signifies that a substantial amount of previously dormant supply is now active, adding a new dynamic to the market landscape. Summary: A Shift in Long-Term Holder Behavior Glassnode’s recent report highlights a significant development in the Bitcoin market: the highest level of BTC spending from the 1-5 year holder cohort since February, totaling $4.02 billion. This increased activity by experienced, long-term holders is a key piece of on-chain data that signals a potential shift in behavior from pure accumulation to distribution or re-allocation. While the exact motivations behind these movements require deeper analysis (are coins going to exchanges, cold storage, or elsewhere?), the sheer volume indicates that a substantial amount of previously illiquid supply is now in motion. This development adds a new layer of complexity to the current crypto market activity and underscores the importance of monitoring on-chain metrics to gain a more comprehensive understanding of underlying market dynamics.

At this point, the company, which issues bonds to buy more Bitcoin, continues to make regular BTC purchases. While MicroStrategy attracts attention with its Bitcoin strategy, Canadian investment company SOL Strategies attracts attention with its Solana (SOL) strategy. SOL Strategies, which has made a name for itself with its Solana acquisitions, has announced a new $1 billion move to buy more SOL. The company announced that it has filed a preliminary prospectus with Canadian securities regulators to issue up to $1 billion in securities over the next 25 months. Once the prospectus is approved, SOL Strategies will be able to issue various financial instruments and raise up to $1 billion without repeating the prospectus process each time. The company plans to use shares, warrants, subscription receipts, debentures or a combination of these to raise funds. At this point, SOL Strategies stated that it plans to invest more in the Solana network in the future by leveraging the capital markets. Leah Wald, CEO of SOL Strategies, said: “Our latest move supports our growth strategy by providing flexibility to access capital as future opportunities arise in the rapidly evolving Solana ecosystem. This strategic move enhances our ability to act decisively and quickly when attractive investment opportunities arise.” SOL Strategies announced in late April that it had secured $500 million in convertible notes to purchase more SOL. At that point, the company said it had signed a $500 million deal with New York-based investment firm ATW Partners. Sol Strategies noted that the deal with ATW Partners is the first of its kind and the largest in the Solana ecosystem.

GameStop is doubling down on its crypto pivot. On Wednesday, May 28, GameStop announced on social media that the company acquired 4,710 Bitcoin (BTC) . The purchase was worth approximately $519 million, with each BTC valued at $109,728 at the time. The stock was higher by more than 3% ahead of Thursday’s opening bell. GameStop has purchased 4,710 Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/gGdr0BRrAv — GameStop (@gamestop) May 28, 2025 The news followed the company’s completion of a $1.5 billion convertible of senior notes on April 1. The sale aimed to leverage GameStop’s memecoin status to buy Bitcoin and boost its share price and appeal to investors. This wasn’t the first time the video game retailer bought Bitcoin. On March 25, GameStop approved a plan to convert a portion of its $4.77 billion in cash reserves into Bitcoin. However, it did not disclose how much of the reserves would be converted. Can Bitcoin save GameStop? The latest move into Bitcoin appears to be an attempt by GameStop to rescue its struggling business by emulating Michael Saylor’s strategy. Back in February, GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen posted a picture with Saylor, a gesture many traders saw as a signal of the company’s Bitcoin pivot. You might also like: Bitcoin cements its haven asset reputation. Is the “means of exchange” narrative still alive? For now, the strategy appears to be working.

Moreover, since first hinting at its Bitcoin pivot in February this year, the stock price rose 40%, from $25, which was its price at the time. GameStop is just one of the companies that is trying to copy Saylor’s Strategy in an effort to boost its stock valuation. For instance, on May 28, Japanese Metaplanet issued $50 million in bonds to expand its Bitcoin purchases.

2025-05-28T12:35:08.000Z,"Grayscale Classifies XRP As a Currency Alongside Bitcoin","In a move sparking fresh excitement across the crypto world, Grayscale Investments — the world’s largest digital asset manager — has officially classified XRP alongside Bitcoin in its “Currencies” segment. This notable update , highlighted by prominent crypto commentator Xaif, drew attention to Grayscale’s evolving approach to digital asset classification and its implications for the broader market. Grayscale’s latest taxonomy update not only reaffirms XRP’s role as a true digital currency but also introduces the AI sector as a formal new category within the crypto ecosystem. This dual development reflects Grayscale’s forward-thinking strategy to capture both established and emerging trends shaping the next generation of blockchain innovation. BREAKING: Grayscale Classifies $XRP with #Bitcoin in ‘Currencies’ Segment as AI Sector Joins Crypto Taxonomy\"" WE'RE SO BACK pic.twitter.com/GA7MN2m6lu — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) May 28, 2025 XRP Gains Institutional Validation as a Currency For years, XRP has occupied a unique—and often contested — space in the digital asset world. Designed as a fast, efficient bridge currency for cross-border payments, XRP has been at the center of one of crypto’s most high-profile regulatory battles: the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple Labs, the company most closely associated with XRP. However, in 2023, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres issued a landmark ruling that declared XRP’s sales on public exchanges do not constitute securities transactions, significantly strengthening XRP’s legal and market position. Now, Grayscale’s decision to group XRP alongside Bitcoin in its “Currencies” classification delivers another powerful signal to institutional investors and the market at large. By emphasizing XRP’s role as a currency, Grayscale is highlighting its primary purpose: enabling fast and affordable cross-border transactions. This added layer of institutional recognition is poised to boost confidence among investors, particularly those who had remained on the sidelines amid the regulatory uncertainties. The AI Sector Officially Enters the Crypto Map While XRP’s inclusion is certainly noteworthy, Grayscale’s formal addition of an AI sector to its crypto taxonomy is arguably even more forward-looking. Over the past two years, artificial intelligence has surged to the forefront of innovation, transforming industries from healthcare to finance. AI’s integration is giving rise to a new generation of decentralized applications, predictive models, AI-powered marketplaces, and generative tools — all built on blockchain foundations. Grayscale’s recognition of AI as a distinct investment category signals that the convergence of these two cutting-edge technologies is no longer just experimental; it’s a rising force poised to reshape the digital asset landscape. For investors, this creates fresh opportunities to gain exposure to projects at the intersection of AI and crypto, a space many believe could define the next decade of technological progress. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Grayscale’s Influence on Market Narratives It’s important to understand that Grayscale isn’t just another player in the crypto market — it’s a market-shaping force. With billions in assets under management and some of the most widely tracked investment products in the space, Grayscale’s portfolio strategies and classifications carry substantial weight. By placing XRP shoulder-to-shoulder with Bitcoin in the “Currencies” segment, Grayscale effectively cements XRP’s role as a foundational asset within the digital economy. Simultaneously, by opening the door to an AI sector, the firm is signaling to both institutional and retail investors that it’s ready to embrace the innovations driving the next wave of crypto adoption. What This Means for Investors For crypto investors watching Grayscale’s moves, there are two key takeaways. First, the reaffirmation of XRP’s status as a currency helps remove lingering doubts about its investment thesis, paving the way for renewed institutional interest. The formal recognition of the AI sector provides investors with a guide to navigate the expanding landscape of crypto projects that utilize artificial intelligence. As Xaif’s coverage underscores, Grayscale’s taxonomy updates are more than just internal housekeeping — they’re signals to the market about where institutional capital and attention are likely to flow next. In an industry where narratives can shift overnight, staying attuned to these institutional signals is essential. As Grayscale continues to evolve its classifications in response to regulatory developments and technological advancements, the crypto landscape can expect further refinement and growth. With XRP gaining fresh validation and AI carving out its place on the crypto map, the stage is set for a new chapter in the evolution of digital assets — one where innovation, utility, and institutional confidence increasingly go hand in hand.

2025-05-28T12:30:34.000Z,"Adam Back calls the beginning of Bitcoin's institutional adoption era","Blockstream CEO Adam Back believes Bitcoin institutional adoption is already here. He argued that cryptocurrency adoption takes time to mature because digital assets develop product playbooks and training. Back also revealed that stablecoins have provided a better banking experience in wire transfers and banking. He noted that stablecoins have enabled 24/7 banking and wire transfers through the weekends. Blockstream’s executive also argued that banks have catching up to do in terms of user experience. Back says institutions are racing to offer Bitcoin products Adam Back , the only individual personally cited in Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin Whitepaper, said Nakamoto first contacted him in August 2008. He also revealed that Hal Finney tested Bitcoin early, where he wrote some explanations and even speculated that BTC could reach a $100-$200 trillion market cap, hinting at $10M per coin. According to him, the ambitious vision of BTC prompted deeper interest because earlier systems had failed due to centralization or unverifiable issuance, but Bitcoin’s decentralized model promised a better path. Back noted that institutions are racing to offer Bitcoin products, including BTC offerings, derivatives, structured products, and ETFs. Blockstream’s CEO argued that regulatory risk has been less severe than anticipated, with Trump’s administration improving Bitcoin’s institutional adoption environment. He also believes that governments like the U.S. are considering Bitcoin for strategic reserves, which has made it easier for institutions to adopt digital assets. “If Bitcoin reaches its full potential, it will be used by everybody, including what some of the early adopters would consider, you know, the establishment that they were hoping to have self-sovereignty to protect themselves from.” -Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream. Adam Back believes Bitcoin will inevitably be financialized. He argued that companies like Strategy multiply their Bitcoin exposure through enterprise value, which he said is sustainable while BTC adoption grows. Back also noted that companies like Strategy could support BTC’s upward price momentum because they acquire Bitcoin directly and offer indirect exposure through instruments such as convertible bonds. Back also highlighted the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin, including investments by sovereign wealth funds. He cited Abu Dhabi’s $408.5 million stake in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF. Adam Back sees Bitcoin hitting $500K to $1M in the current market cycle Adam Back says \""$100,000 is way too cheap\"" and that Bitcoin gets between \""$500,000 and $1 Million during this cycle.\"" 🚀 pic.twitter.com/hcq9HeooCk — Bold Bitcoin (@BoldBitcoin) May 14, 2025 Adam Back expressed his surprise at BTC’s current price level, which is hovering around $108,600 at the time of publication, given the surge in institutional interest and major developments in the crypto industry. He believes that the digital currency could surge to between $500,000 and $1 million per coin during the current market cycle. Despite being slightly below its all-time high of nearly $112,000, the crypto mogul argued the price does not yet reflect the full scope of bullish momentum building behind the asset. He noted that the four-year cycle in the asset’s price action tends to stretch over time, and we’re still early in the current one. Adam Back argued that key catalysts include the U.S. approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have already drawn in more than $44 billion in net inflows. According to him, ETFs offered by financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity have opened the door to a new wave of investors, particularly those previously hesitant to hold virtual currencies directly. Blockstream’s CEO mentioned that much of the investor capital tends to arrive after prices begin to rise. He also argued that the market could get a new all-time high much quicker, emphasizing that momentum and retail psychology often fuel further gains. Michael Saylor, founder of Strategy, noted that BTC’s recent price stagnation below the $150K mark can be attributed to short-term holders exiting the market. He explained on May 9 that a market rotation is underway, with non-long-term holders cashing out and a new wave of committed investors entering. Saylor acknowledged that a lot of Bitcoin remained in the hands of governments, lawyers, and bankruptcy trustees. He believes those parties don’t have a 10-year mindset and are seizing the rally as an opportunity to liquidate. The crypto mogul also revealed that Bitcoin is now finding its way into the hands of institutions and investors with a longer time horizon, particularly through spot BTC ETFs and corporate treasury strategies.

2025-05-28T12:30:32.000Z,"Trump Media Makes Waves With Major $2.5 Billion Bitcoin Purchase","President Donald Trump’s social media company , Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), has announced plans to invest in the market’s leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) on Tuesday. According to a report by Politico, the company, which oversees the Truth Social platform, has secured commitments from approximately 50 large investors to raise $2.5 billion through a combination of stock and debt. Trump Media Expands Into Bitcoin Devin Nunes, CEO of TMTG and a former Republican representative, remarked , “We view Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets.” Nunes further described this Bitcoin investment as a pivotal step in defending the company against financial institutions that may impose discriminatory practices on Americans and US businesses. Nunes also highlighted that the acquisition would enhance synergies related to subscription payments, a proposed utility token , and other financial transactions across Truth Social and the company’s streaming platform, Truth+. The company anticipates that the fundraising efforts will conclude by Thursday. Beyond this, the move signals a growing interest in cryptocurrency from Trump and his family’s business ventures, which have seen setbacks in recent years. Shares Of TMTG Drop Despite Initial Surge The Trump family has previously supported various crypto initiatives, including World Liberty Financial (WLFI), while Eric Trump co-founded American Bitcoin, which recently announced plans to go public. Just days before his inauguration back in January, President Donald Trump launched his own cryptocurrency , TRUMP, which rose from below $10 to beyond $70 in just 24 hours on the heels of major excitement surrounding this launch. However, this foray into the crypto space has raised ethical and conflict-of-interest concerns within Washington. As reported by Bitcoinist last week, the President hosted a gala dinner at his Virginia golf club for top holders of his memecoin, which prompted protests outside the venue. For TMTG, the decision to invest in BTC represents a new direction for the company, which has primarily relied on advertising revenue from Truth Social. In December, Trump transferred his stake in the company to a trust managed by his son, Donald Trump Jr., who is also a board member. Following the announcement of the new Bitcoin treasury, shares of TMTG, trading under the ticker “DJT,” initially surged in early trading but later fell by more than 5%. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has managed to regain the $110,000 after a slight pullback below the $109,000 mark to open the week.

2025-05-28T12:27:06.000Z,"GameStop Buys $512M in Bitcoin, Joins Crypto Elite","The post GameStop Buys $512M in Bitcoin, Joins Crypto Elite appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News GameStop has officially entered the Bitcoin game with a splash, acquiring 4,710 BTC in its first-ever crypto purchase. The announcement, made via the company’s official X account on May 28, positions the gaming retailer as one of the more prominent public holders of Bitcoin, joining the ranks of MicroStrategy and Tesla. With Bitcoin trading around $108,800 at the time, GameStop’s holdings are valued at roughly $512 million. However, the company didn’t reveal the exact purchase price in its SEC filing. GameStop has purchased 4,710 Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/gGdr0BRrAv — GameStop (@gamestop) May 28, 2025 Backed by $1.5B in Convertible Notes GameStop was able to buy Bitcoin because, back in April, it raised $1.5 billion by selling a special kind of IOU to investors. These IOUs don’t pay any interest and are due to be paid back in 2030. Investors were so interested that GameStop even raised an extra $200 million. The company clearly said in official filings that this money would be used to buy Bitcoin. This big crypto move shows that GameStop is trying to branch out from its struggling video game business. The company had already tried its hand at NFTs and launched its crypto wallet before. While the news boosted positive vibes around Bitcoin and slightly pushed its price up, no one knows yet if GameStop plans to keep buying more BTC or if this was just a one-time splash to try something new with its cash. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Analysis: May Rally and Lark Davis’s Take on Market Top Signals , Crypto Community Reacts GameStop’s entry into crypto has been welcomed by many in the digital asset space, with some seeing it as a bullish signal for broader corporate adoption. Crypto user Tommy T calls GameStop’s 4,710 BTC buy more than just a purchase; it’s a power move. Once mocked as “dumb money,” retail investors are now outsmarting hedge funds. He says the game is changing, and retail isn’t just playing, it’s rewriting the rules. Still, skeptics remain cautious, waiting to see how the company integrates Bitcoin into its future roadmap amid ongoing retail challenges. CEO in Legal Scoop? Additionally, GameStop’s CEO, Ryan Cohen, is currently facing a lawsuit over $47.2 million he earned from trading Bed Bath & Beyond shares just before the company went bankrupt. The case claims that Cohen and his firm, RC Ventures, may have made “short-swing” trades, which could force them to return those profits. Either way, GameStop’s $512M Bitcoin buy cements its commitment to digital innovation and could be a peak moment in its ongoing reinvention. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-28T12:26:05.000Z,"SharpLink’s Ethereum Treasury Move Triggers 400% Stock Surge","When SharpLink Gaming Ltd. announced that it was taking its corporate treasury to Ethereum, few would have thought the market reaction. Within hours, the company's shares increased by 400%, catapulting the sports betting tech firm to crypto stardom. But behind the headline flash is a story of strategic innovation, industry alignment, and a bold bet on the digital asset future. A New Type of Corporate Treasury SharpLink's move is more than a news headline maker — it's a return to fundamentals in the manner in which companies treat their balance sheets. CEO Rob Phythian stated in a statement, ”We believe Ethereum's ecosystem offers both the liquidity and programmability to support our long-term vision.” The company has begun to transition much of its cash reserves into Ethereum (ETH), joining the ranks of the first publicly traded companies to formally adopt an ETH-denominated policy of the treasury. This is not just about having a risky asset. SharpLink board minutes reveal a plan to leverage Ethereum's DeFi protocols to earn yields, hedge, and even use for working payments. The company considers ETH not only a store of value but also an operational working capital asset—much like the way MicroStrategy famously leveraged Bitcoin to turbocharge its own treasury. Consensys Joins the Board: Strategic Alignment The intrigue was compounded when blockchain giant Consensys, the company behind MetaMask and a force behind the development of Ethereum, joined SharpLink's board. Consensys possesses deep technical acumen and a close relationship with the underlying breakthroughs of Ethereum. ”This partnership is not simply about investment,” said a representative for Consensys. ”It's about injecting Ethereum-native thinking into the DNA of an innovation-focused company.” Insiders forecast Consensys will help guide SharpLink along on-chain treasury management, smart contract integrations, and even tokenization strategies in the future. The move is part of an emerging trend: crypto veterans are calling for influence in traditional industries as Ethereum's institutional appeal grows. Following MicroStrategy — But with Ether SharpLink's playbook tracks MicroStrategy's legendary Bitcoin pivot, except for one twist. While MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor took on the role of Bitcoin evangelist, SharpLink is betting on Ethereum's more utility and network effects. Company Treasury Asset Strategy Highlights Stock Reaction MicroStrategy Bitcoin (BTC) Buy-and-hold, leverage, advocacy +1,000%+ SharpLink Ethereum (ETH) DeFi integration, board expansion +400% The difference? Ethereum programmability allows SharpLink to do more than just hold. The company can stake ETH, earn yield, and potentially use smart contracts for payroll, vendor payments, and more. This kind of flexibility can set the new standard for how tech companies manage digital assets. On-Chain Treasury Moves and Tax Implications Blockchain sleuths have already pinpointed SharpLink's treasury wallet accumulating ETH, with inflows via large exchanges and DeFi protocols. SharpLink is experimenting with staking and liquidity pools, which can boost returns but exposes the company to smart contract risk, say analysts. Tax professionals are watching closely. Unlike Bitcoin, which is more likely to be considered a non-yielding asset, ETH staking rewards might be considered income, triggering different tax obligations. ”SharpLink will need to meticulously track its on-chain activity,” says crypto tax attorney Lisa Tran. ”The IRS is watching very closely what kind of reporting businesses are doing on staking and DeFi yields.” Altseason Signal? Ether's Price Target and Forecast SharpLink's flagship ETH treasury move has fueled speculation of a wider ”altseason”—a period during which alternative coins outperform Bitcoin. Some experts interpret this as evidence that Ethereum is growing as an organizational reserve asset, especially with ETH 2.0 upgrades and institutional adoption gaining momentum. While it's too early to call a new trend, Ether bulls are eyeing price levels above $10,000 on the strength of expanding demand from corporations and decentralized applications. ”SharpLink's move is potentially the trigger that can initiate another wave of corporate ETH adoption,” says market analyst Rahul Patel. ”If others were to follow, we might witness a sea change in treasury management practices.”.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9342/sharp-link-s-ethereum-treasury-move-triggers-400-stock-surge,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Ethereum",cryptocompare
2025-05-28T12:23:52.000Z,"Bitcoin Pepe Is Flying—$11.8m Raised and Only 3 Days Left","The post Bitcoin Pepe Is Flying—$11.8m Raised and Only 3 Days Left appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News What if the next 100x doesn’t launch on Solana or Ethereum, but on Bitcoin? With $11.8m raised and no competitors, Bitcoin Pepe is accelerating toward a Tier-1 exchange debut on May 31 that could reshape how Bitcoin works for retail. BPEP is the first meme ICO that’s setting up Bitcoin’s next growth phase, one that isn’t just institutional but grassroots, creator-driven, and performance-ready. With just 3 days to go, the window is closing on what might be the first truly viral Layer 2 ecosystem on BTC. With new partnerships being announced every day and energy accelerating toward launch, make sure to check the official Bitcoin Pepe for the latest updates. Bitcoin’s missing piece: Bitcoin Pepe’s layer 2 fixes what BTC left behind Bitcoin Pepe is developing PEP-20, a new token standard that makes it possible to issue, trade, and interact with meme assets natively on Bitcoin. Ethereum has ERC-20, but Bitcoin never had a native way to scale tokens—until now. The potential ripple effect is huge. Low-cost meme creation invites the same kind of explosion we saw on Solana: an open field of creators, culture, and rapid liquidity formation. It’s about unlocking new utility on top of it, at a moment when Bitcoin’s price makes traditional entry increasingly out of reach for most. This is the first meme ICO on Bitcoin, and it’s not just symbolic. It’s about building an open architecture where memes and microassets can finally live on the world’s oldest chain. BTC maximalists stay for the trust, degens stay for the gains, and creators stay for the tools. BPEP price outlook: Why Bitcoin Pepe could outpace the market Bitcoin Pepe is building on one of crypto’s strongest narratives: retail investors want high-upside exposure on the most trusted chain. With Bitcoin’s price breaking above $110K and institutions buying in, BPEP offers a low-barrier, high-energy entry point that BTC itself simply doesn’t. Interest in Bitcoin Pepe is intensifying as it prepares for its May 31 listing. Major partnerships, high-level exchange rumors, and a perfect macro setup are all feeding into what could be the biggest meme-layer launch on any chain this year. Top-tier platforms such as OKX and Bybit are reportedly preparing to list BPEP, paving the way for significant volume. Meanwhile, the team is expanding fast, aligning with Web3 gaming ( Crypto Hunters and GETE Network ), DeFi ( Plena Finance and Catamoto ), fair launch platforms ( Super Meme ), and content-first networks ( BETV ). These are to anchor BPEP in real utility and culture, two ingredients needed to scale. The momentum is also social. Influencers on X and YouTube have already picked up the scent. And if Bitcoin continues climbing toward a new ATH—as macro signals increasingly suggest—then tokens tied to its upside, like BPEP, could surge. The big question is whether this becomes the Solana moment for Bitcoin, a layer with real throughput, meme velocity, and network reach. When Solana’s token economy exploded, its value increased by 1000 times because it facilitated large-scale activity. Bitcoin Pepe is doing exactly that, but on the most credible chain in the world. Solana on Bitcoin launches in less than 3 days Bitcoin is winning over institutions, but retail is priced out and is hunting for the next breakout opportunity. At $110K, BTC won’t deliver 100x. But with over $11.8m raised and a current price of only $0.0377, Bitcoin Pepe might. It’s a layer 2 engineered to activate retail, creators, and builders on Bitcoin itself —something BTC has never offered. While institutions are accumulating Bitcoin for the long term, Bitcoin Pepe is paving the way for those who missed the initial surge but are determined not to miss this one. Long story short, Bitcoin Pepe is how retail comes back in.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/bitcoin-pepe-is-flying-11-2m-raised-and-only-5-days-left/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|SOL|TRADING|ZRX","Sponsored",cryptocompare
2025-05-28T12:19:17.000Z,"Altcoin Season ‘Hasn’t Even Started Yet,’ Says Crypto Trader Michaël van de Poppe","Despite recent doubts surrounding the future of altcoins, prominent crypto trader and MN Trading Capital founder Michaël van de Poppe believes the altcoin season is not over—it hasn’t even begun. In a post on X dated May 28, van de Poppe dismissed bearish sentiment in the market, arguing that many altcoins are still trading near their local bottoms. “I don’t understand why people start claiming that a bear market is around the corner,” he said. “They are literally on the bottom.” He added that the crypto market is heading into the “final easy 12–24 months,” suggesting that a prolonged bullish phase could be on the horizon for altcoins. Van de Poppe’s optimism follows a mixed 30-day performance across altcoins. Solana has gained 17.84% over the past month, now trading at $175.17, but is still down over 32% since mid-January. XRP has posted a modest 1.98% increase and is trading at $2.31, yet remains 29.35% lower than its January highs. Traders Signal Incoming Altcoin Season Other traders have echoed van de Poppe’s view, suggesting that altcoins are preparing for a major rally. Crypto trader Davinci Jeremie confidently declared that “soon, altcoins will turn into a wildfire,” while another well-followed trader known as Moustache said, “altcoin season isn’t just a meme. It’s coming.” A common belief among analysts is that a true altcoin season often begins after a period of Ether outperforming Bitcoin. The ETH/BTC ratio currently stands at 0.02430, having climbed 26.74% in the past 30 days. This ratio is considered a key indicator for predicting altcoin momentum , as rising Ether strength often signals increased investor appetite for riskier assets. Still, caution persists. CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index , which measures how the top 100 altcoins have performed against Bitcoin over the last 90 days, currently sits at just 24 out of 100—a score that suggests Bitcoin remains the dominant force in the market . Smaller Tokens See Notable Gains While most major altcoins have underperformed compared to Bitcoin, some lesser-known tokens have surged. Fartcoin leads the way with a staggering 316.72% gain over the past 90 days. It is followed by Four (FORM) with a 148.15% increase and Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), up 107.47%. Despite the skepticism, the recent uptick in altcoin activity may be a sign that the long-awaited altseason is just around the corner.

The announcement comes at a time when Bitcoin continues to assert itself as digital gold, drawing increasing interest from institutions, corporations, and investors alike.

GameStop has purchased 4,710 Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/gGdr0BRrAv — GameStop (@gamestop) May 28, 2025 From Meme Stock Legend to Bitcoin Holder GameStop’s adoption of Bitcoin marks a significant shift in its corporate trajectory. Once seen as a struggling brick-and-mortar retailer, GameStop shot to international fame in early 2021 when retail traders on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum engineered a historic short squeeze, propelling the company’s stock price and turning it into a symbol of grassroots financial rebellion. Since that time, GameStop has worked to reinvent itself, exploring digital initiatives such as NFTs, blockchain gaming, and online commerce. The addition of 4,710 BTC to its balance sheet signals that the company is now betting on Bitcoin’s long-term value and global relevance. For GameStop, this isn’t merely a speculative move — it’s a calculated effort to align with the forces reshaping the future of finance and technology. Joining a Growing Corporate Trend With this purchase, GameStop joins a growing list of prominent companies integrating Bitcoin into their corporate treasuries. Strategy , under the leadership of Bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor, has famously acquired over 200,000 BTC, establishing itself as the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency. Tesla made headlines in 2021 with its own high-profile Bitcoin acquisition, while fintech giant Block (formerly Square) has consistently positioned Bitcoin at the center of its long-term vision. By stepping into this elite circle, GameStop signals confidence in Bitcoin’s role as more than just a volatile asset — it sees Bitcoin as a strategic reserve and a hedge against inflation and currency risk. As macroeconomic uncertainty continues to swirl globally, Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature make it increasingly appealing for companies seeking to diversify their balance sheets and future-proof their financial strategies.

While GameStop has faced challenges maintaining profitability in a rapidly shifting retail environment, its bold entrance into the world of digital assets suggests a willingness to explore unconventional growth strategies. This move could reinvigorate investor interest, particularly among those eager to see GameStop push beyond its past as a brick-and-mortar retailer. GameStop’s move simultaneously boosts Bitcoin’s credibility as a viable asset for corporate treasuries. Each new public company that adopts Bitcoin adds momentum to its growing mainstream acceptance. GameStop’s decision could encourage other mid-cap and emerging companies to explore Bitcoin as a financial option, especially those looking to connect with younger, tech-savvy audiences. A Bold Bet on the Digital Future At its heart, GameStop’s purchase of 4,710 Bitcoin is more than just a financial transaction — it’s a statement about where the company believes the future is headed. As Bitcoin continues to attract institutional investment and command global attention, GameStop’s bold step positions it at the crossroads of gaming, finance, and technology. Whether this move ultimately proves to be a masterstroke or a risky gamble remains to be seen. But one thing is certain: GameStop is no longer just the poster child of the meme stock era — it is now an active participant in the sweeping transformation of global finance. By joining the Bitcoin bandwagon, GameStop has once again captured the world’s attention, this time with a move that could redefine its place in the digital age.

2025-05-28T12:16:11.000Z,"Strive Raises $750M for Alpha-Driven Bitcoin Treasury Fund","Strive Asset Management has made headlines with a $750 million private raise to support what it calls an ”alpha-generating” Bitcoin treasury strategy. With warrants that could potentially take the total raise to $1.5 billion, Strive is emerging as a formidable new player in the corporate Bitcoin treasury space — one that's not just going to hold BTC, but try to beat it. Within Strive's Alpha-Generating Strategy Unlike most corporate Bitcoin treasury strategies, which merely involve the buying and holding of BTC as a reserve asset, Strive CEO Matt Cole has outlined a more complex, multi-dimensional strategy. The company's strategy includes: Strive will buy firms trading below their net cash value, freeing up discounted cash to be redeployed into Bitcoin. In partnership with 117 Partners LLC, Strive is targeting Mt. Gox exchange claims with the mission to buy up to 75,000 BTC at deep discounts to spot prices. The firm will be buying the lowest tranches of structured BTC credit vehicles, contributing to yield potential. Cole discusses that such ”alpha-generating” strategies require a new paradigm of valuation, as they are designed to deliver returns above and beyond Bitcoin's performance itself — an ambition that sets Strive apart from incumbents. Who's Behind Strive? The $750 million was raised through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) round by leading institutional investors and Strive's management. The deal was priced at a 121% premium to Asset Entities' (ASST) pre-merger announcement closing price, and, noteworthy, it has no debt financing—preserving future leverage ability. Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. acted as sole placement agent and financial advisor, and legal counsel was provided by Davis Polk, DLA Piper, and Bevilacqua PLLC. Strive vs. MicroStrategy and Tesla: A New Model Emerges Company BTC Treasury Strategy BTC Holdings (approx.) Key Differentiator Strive Alpha-driven, discounted acquisitions Target: up to 75,000+ Outperformance focus and novel assets MicroStrategy Buy and hold, leverage, equity raises 568,840 Largest holder and “infinite money glitch” Tesla Buy and hold, smaller allocation ~10,500 Diversification and less aggressive While MicroStrategy (recently renamed simply ”Strategy”) has become the name most synonymous with corporate Bitcoin accumulation—having invested over $39 billion to amass 568,840 BTC — its strategy has been largely one of leveraged beta to Bitcoin's price. Tesla, meanwhile, holds a smaller, diversified position. Strive's approach is quite different: by acquiring distressed and discounted assets, it hopes to gain exposure to Bitcoin at below market value, with the intention of beating BTC's own performance. Were it to be successful, it would place Strive near the top of corporate Bitcoin holders, alongside or even ahead of the likes of MicroStrategy and Tesla in both ambition and strategy. Expert Commentary: Market Impact and Risks Treasury management experts note that Strive's strategy is ushering in a new era of institutional crypto adoption. By integrating traditional corporate finance approaches with innovative crypto asset transactions, Strive could be setting an example for the future of treasury management. As quoted by one treasury consultant: ”Strive's willingness to purchase discounted and distressed Bitcoin holdings represents a shift from passive hodling to active yield generation. If they execute it correctly, it could redefine how digital asset reserves are managed by corporations.” However, experts also caution that these approaches are not without unique risks — legal, operational, and market. The success of buying Mt. Gox claims, for example, is dependent on regulatory approval and creditor repayment timing. In addition, while institutional demand for crypto is increasing, volatility and regulatory uncertainty remain acute concerns. Potential Market Impact Strive’s aggressive accumulation and innovative strategies could: Increase competition for discounted BTC assets, especially as more companies seek to emulate this model. Add upward pressure to Bitcoin prices if large claims are settled and converted to spot BTC. Spur further institutional adoption, as treasury teams look for ways to generate yield and hedge against fiat currency risks The bottom line Strive’s $750 million raise marks a bold new chapter in corporate Bitcoin treasury management. By seeking alpha through discounted and distressed crypto assets, the firm is not just joining the ranks of institutional BTC holders — it’s aiming to set the pace. As the market watches Strive’s next moves, the outcome could reshape both treasury management and the broader landscape of institutional crypto adoption",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9341/strive-raises-750-m-for-alpha-driven-bitcoin-treasury-fund,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-05-28T12:15:27.000Z,"31% of US crypto holders own meme coins before Bitcoin or Ethreum","According to Gemini’s 2025 report, 31% of new US investors purchase meme coins first before venturing into popular tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Similarly , globally, more than 30% of first-time crypto buyers buy meme coins to learn about wallets, tokenomics, and on-chain interactions before they can progress to the other top digital currencies. Over 94% of meme coin holders invest in established assets eventually Gemini’s study also found that around 30% of new crypto users in Australia first held meme coins, followed by 28% in the UK, 23% in Singapore, 22% in Italy, and 19% in France. Still, over 94% of meme coin buyers ultimately invest in top coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum , suggesting that meme coins serve as an on-ramp to the broader crypto-asset market. Analysts have suggested that long-term investment stability could generally be achieved through mature digital assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. So, while meme coins are a good gateway asset today, it’s important to pivot to more sustainable assets. DeFi commentator Ignas even commented recently, “Technically innovative launches are getting hype again…It’s not just your Degen monkey brain blindly aping into meme coins or simping for a new Celeb Coin – your analytical & research skills can be put to action again.” Meanwhile, Justin Sun, founder of Tron Blockchain and Huobi Global advisor, believes investors are drawn to meme coins because of the asset’s ability to command their attention. He argued that today’s economy revolves around attention—and memes are powerful attention magnets. He even stated, “If you get attention from everybody, you can actually control the universe.” Investors lean toward institutional ETFs for their crypto holdings In addition to the growing interest in meme coins, there has been an increase in the use of institutional infrastructure. About 39% of US crypto investors hold crypto through ETFs, up from 37% in 2024. Of the 39%, 25% hold their crypto through an exchange wallet and an ETF, while only 14% solely use an ETF. Spot crypto ETFs are an investor favorite, receiving hundreds of billions in inflows and fueling Bitcoin price surges. This May, the 11 US-listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have recorded a net inflow of $5.77 billion, the highest since November 2024. BlackRock’s IBIT saw the most monthly inflows, with Bitcoin’s spot price surpassing $110000. BlackRock even increased its Bitcoin spot ETF holdings by 25%. As of March 31, its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) holdings were at 2,123,592 shares, worth $994 million, an increase of about 25% compared to 1,691,143 shares held as of the end of last year. The asset manager is still planning to diversify its investment into the digital asset market away from its bond-oriented portfolio. Blockstream CEO Adam Back believes the company’s interest in increasing its investments could help propel BTC prices further.

This is the first time the company has admitted to buying any crypto since it said in March that it was planning to do so. In March, GameStop made it public that it would be raising funds via a $1.4 billion convertible notes offering. That money has now been partly used for this crypto purchase. The speculation around this started earlier this year when GameStop began hinting at exploring alternatives outside its core retail business. GameStop’s stock reacts to crypto pivot as financial concerns remain Before GameStop confirmed anything, its stock had already been moving. Rumors in February caused a surge of about 18%. The March announcement drove the price up by another 12%. On May 27, GameStop shares closed at $35 and were trading at $36.30 in the pre-market session the next morning. Over the last month, the stock is up around 30%, and about 10% higher for the year. However, the Bitcoin buy comes while the core retail business is shrinking. The latest quarterly report shows a 28% drop in revenue year-on-year. That kind of decline doesn’t align well with the current hype surrounding the stock. GameStop’s trailing price-to-earnings ratio is sitting above 100x, which is way out of line for a retail company. The valuation gap has raised a lot of eyebrows. Only one analyst is still tracking GameStop on Barchart. That analyst currently has a “Strong Sell” rating on the stock, placing a target of $13.50. If that plays out, GameStop could drop over 60% from where it stands now. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

GME premarket stock performance. Source: Google Notably, GameStop has taken another bold step into the cryptocurrency space, announcing the acquisition of no less than 4710 Bitcoin ( BTC ) for $513 million. While the exact financial details are not available, the investment seems to highlight GameStop’s confidence in digital currencies. Recall that the games retailer also announced a $1.3 billion debt offering to fund its BTC acquisition just two months ago. The company appears to be doing better financially, so it can probably afford such exuberance. After all, it boasts a market cap of $15.66 billion, and its expected earnings per share for the current quarter are about +125% year-over-year. GameStop is diversifying More generally, the retailer has been diversifying a lot recently, especially in e-commerce. CEO Ryan Cohen spent a chunky $1 billion on Alibaba (NYSE: BABA ) shares alone, for example. Things are not all rainbows and sunshine, however. Namely, Cohen is facing legal challenges over alleged “short-swing” trading profits totaling $47.2 million related to Bed Bath & Beyond (NYSE: BBBY) stock trades. Whatever the case, the new BTC purchase and expansion moves reflect GameStop’s approach to integrating gaming, e-commerce, and digital finance , and as such, they are not to be ignored.

2025-05-28T12:00:51.000Z,"Bitcoin Could Explode On Bessent’s $250 Billion Deregulation Shock","US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has signalled that the long-debated overhaul of banks’ supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) is imminent—a policy pivot that could reverberate through Bitcoin markets—telling television interviewers that regulators are “very close to moving” on the rule and that the adjustment could compress Treasury yields by “tens of basis points.” Rocket Fuel For Bitcoin Although the proposal must still clear the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the FDIC, the direction of travel is clear: exempting, or partially exempting, US Treasuries from the SLR will let large banks recycle balance-sheet capacity into fresh purchases of government debt. The SLR, introduced after the 2008–2009 crisis, forces even risk-free assets such as Treasuries to carry a capital charge; a global systemically important bank must fund five cents of equity for every dollar of total assets, including central-bank reserves. Bessent’s plan would lift that burden for sovereign bonds, a step the industry has lobbied for since the temporary pandemic waiver expired in March 2021. Kevin Fromer, chief executive of the Financial Services Forum, calls the current leverage-based stack “outdated and at odds with financial stability and economic growth,” describing relief as necessary “to better serve US taxpayers, capital markets, consumers, businesses, and the economy.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters A Massive Week: Key Events To Watch While officials frame the move as a micro-prudential calibration, the macro-liquidity impulse is substantial. Market commentator Furkan Yildirim tells his 103,000 subscribers that US banks collectively hold about $5 trillion in Treasuries; eliminating the five-percent capital haircut would liberate roughly $250 billion of tier-one capital—fifty times the Federal Reserve’s current monthly quantitative-tightening pace of $5 billion. “This is a liquidity injection by regulatory pen stroke,” he says, adding that the step “lowers yields without the Fed printing money,” a mix that historically pushes investors further out the risk curve. The market is already trading on that expectation. Benchmark ten-year yields slid below 3.95 percent after Bessent’s remarks and after President Trump deferred a threatened 50 percent tariff on EU goods until 9 July. Yildirim argues that “every basis-point drop in the ten-year is basically a marketing campaign for Bitcoin,” because “liquidity doesn’t disappear—it just looks for a new home.” He stresses that the Treasury’s willingness to change bank-capital rules, rather than rely on the central bank, “tells you how cornered policymakers feel by deficits, debt service and political optics.” Related Reading: Bitcoin SLRV Ribbons Turn Green—What Happens Next? Not everyone is convinced the rule change will work as intended. Critics such as Peter Boockvar of Bleakley Advisory note that banks’ appetite for duration risk has not fully recovered since the 2023 regional-bank failures; if dealers fail to absorb the incremental Treasury supply, the Federal Reserve could be forced back into the market. The Bank Policy Institute, while welcoming SLR relief, argues that it must be paired with a broader rethink of post-crisis overlays such as the GSIB surcharge and the stress-test regime to unlock balance-sheet capacity on a lasting basis. Bitcoin, however, responds reflexively to dollar-liquidity metrics. Lower Treasury yields diminish the allure of money-market funds paying north of five percent, releasing capital that has been parked in cash-equivalent vehicles since 2022. On-chain data highlighted by Yildirim show over-the-counter (OTC) desk inventories sliding to 115,000 BTC, evidence that large buyers are sourcing coins directly; when that stock is depleted, desks must restock from public exchanges, a dynamic that tightens float and historically amplifies upside moves. Ultimately the SLR reprieve is no panacea for America’s fiscal arithmetic, but it removes a near-term balance-sheet choke point and lowers the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets. As Yildirim puts it, “A deregulation that stabilises sovereign funding while nudging investors into risk assets is, almost by definition, a tailwind for Bitcoin.” In that sense the rule change functions like shadow quantitative easing, arriving at a moment when the Federal Reserve is hamstrung by sticky inflation and political constraints—one more structural catalyst for Bitcoin. At press time, BTC traded at $108,790.

Despite the dip, crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO believes XRP may be setting up for a breakout, citing a potential bull flag pattern. But how realistic is this rally—and what should investors really expect? XRP Price Movement: A Quick Recap At the start of May, XRP stood at $2.1920. After a minor 3.88% correction early in the month, XRP surged 21.47% to a monthly high of $2.63 on May 12. However, by May 17, XRP had lost nearly 9% from that peak, dragged down by mounting sell pressure. As of writing, XRP is trading at $2.3024, down 13.28% from its monthly high. What Is a Bull Flag—and Why Does It Matter? According to EGRAG CRYPTO, XRP’s chart now shows a classic bull flag pattern. This technical pattern typically appears after a strong upward movement and signals a possible continuation of the rally. “We’re seeing consolidation within a parallel range—a textbook flag structure,” he explained in a post on X. While patterns aren’t guarantees, they often inform short- to mid-term price targets when confirmed with volume and market momentum. XRP Price Targets: Three Methods, One Big Range To calculate the potential upside, the analyst applied three methods: 1. Logarithmic Chart Projection Log charts show percentage change, not just price movement. Using this method, XRP could reach $18 . 2. Non-Logarithmic Chart Projection Using a standard linear scale (common in traditional stock charts), the target is more conservative: $5.50 . 3. Averaged Midpoint Target Taking the average of both: a neutral estimate of $11.75 . Due to market volatility and thin liquidity, the analyst cautions that targets may overshoot or undershoot by 15–20%. Adjusted Targets: Base Target +15% +20% $18.00 $20.70 $21.60 $11.75 $13.51 $14.10 $5.50 $6.33 $6.60 .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : ‘XRP is An American Coin Cleared by SEC’, Says Analyst , Community Sentiment and What to Watch Next EGRAG encouraged the XRP community to stay focused and patient, suggesting he sees conviction in the technical setup. However, other experts urge caution. Analysts like Benjamin Cowen have previously warned that many altcoins continue to lose ground to Bitcoin in ALT/BTC pairs.

2025-05-28T11:47:44.000Z,"Ether Favored Over Bitcoin by Big Money, Here Are 3 Clues That Point to ETH Bias in Crypto Market","The futures and options market, a proxy for big money, is increasingly backing ether ETH over bitcoin BTC in a major market shift. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, recently reached record highs of over $ 110,000. According to CoinDesk data, the cryptocurrency has gained over 16% this year, drawing strength from the macroeconomic factors and persistent inflows into the spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Meanwhile, ether has dropped 20% this year despite its parent blockchain, Ethereum, maintaining its pole position in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and tokenization markets. The performance gap, however, may be closed in the near term as the following indicator shows a growing bullish bias for ether. Options indicate bullish sentiment for ether Options listed on Deribit show a stronger bullish positioning for ether relative to bitcoin. Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy and represents a bullish bet on the market, while a put option provides protection against price drops. As of writing, both BTC and ETH's 25-delta risk reversals, a measure of sentiment derived by examining the difference in implied volatility (demand) between calls and puts, were positive, reflecting a bias towards call options. However, ETH risk reversals were more expensive than BTC. In other words, traders were relatively more bullish on ether compared to bitcoin. CME futures open interest The notional open interest in CME bitcoin futures, which represents the dollar value of the number of active contracts, has risen by roughly 70% to over $17 billion since the early April crash, according to data source Velo. The growth, however, has stalled above $17 billion over the past seven days. The CME is considered a proxy for institutional activity. Meanwhile, ether's open interest has jumped 186% to $3.15 billion since the early April crash. The growth has accelerated over the past two weeks. The diverging trends show institutions are increasingly leaning toward ether. Futures premiums and perpetual funding rates The bias for ETH is also evident from the relative richness of premiums in ether futures. As of the time of writing, one-month Ether futures boasted an annualized premium of 10.5%, the highest since January, according to Velo. Meanwhile, bitcoin futures premium was 8.74%. Elevated premiums indicate optimism and strong buying interest, often signaling a bullish trend. Therefore, the relative richness of ether futures premium suggests traders are more bullish on ETH compared to BTC. After all, ether is still 84% short of record highs reached during the 2021 bull run. There is also a possibility that the BTC's basis may have been held lower by cash and carry arbitrage (non-directional) traders. A similar divergence is observed on offshore exchanges, where annualized funding rates, representing the cost of holding long positions in ETH perpetual futures, has neared the 8% mark. Meanwhile, BTC's funding rates hold below 5%.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/28/ether-favored-over-bitcoin-by-big-money-here-are-3-clues-that-point-to-eth-bias-in-crypto-market,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Ether|Bitcoin|Markets|market analysis|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-28T11:45:52.000Z,"Goldman Sachs Predicts $4,000 Gold, Sees Precious Metal As Superior Stock Market Hedge to Bitcoin","A commodities researcher at the banking giant Goldman Sachs thinks gold will surge to $4,000 per troy ounce by mid-2026. Daan Struyven, Goldman’s co-head of global commodities research, outlined the prediction in a new discussion with the energy-focused strategy firm Veriten. Gold is currently priced at $3,310.74 per troy ounce. Struyven notes that gold and Bitcoin ( BTC ) have certain similarities that are attractive to investors in the current environment. “Supply is very limited. The vast majority of the available gold supply has already been mined, and Bitcoin supply, by design, is limited, and I think this limited supply gives some confidence to investors who are worried about runaway inflation which may be caused by a potentially aggressive increase in money supply.” Bitcoin has booked higher returns than gold over the past few years, but is also more volatile and sensitive to drawdowns, Struyven explains. The top crypto asset is more positively correlated with tech equities. Because of that correlation, the Goldman Sachs analyst argues that gold is more effective as a safe-haven asset than BTC in terms of hedging against equity downside. “Both Bitcoin and equities tend to do well when risk sentiment is positive.” BTC is trading at $109,078 at time of writing after hitting a new all-time high of $111,814 late last week. The top-ranked crypto asset by market cap is up nearly 2.5% in the past week and 16% in the past month. ?

2025-05-28T11:45:18.000Z,"Michael Saylor’s Strategy Slows Bitcoin Buys as MSTR Premium Shrinks, Says K33","Key Takeaways: Strategy’s Bitcoin buying pace has slowed as MSTR’s premium to net asset value declines. K33 cites rising competition from over 70 firms adopting Bitcoin treasury strategies. Strategy still leads the pack with 580,250 BTC, worth over $63 billion. Strategy, the Bitcoin-focused firm formerly known as MicroStrategy, appears to be easing its pace of Bitcoin acquisitions, according to a new report from K33 Research . The company, led by co-founder Michael Saylor, remains the largest publicly traded holder of Bitcoin, but its recent purchase cadence has cooled compared to the frenzied buying seen last November. In its latest filing, Strategy revealed it bought 4,020 BTC between May 19 and May 25 for $427.1 million, using proceeds from its ongoing $21 billion at-the-market (ATM) offering. However, capital raised from the program has slowed. Only $348.7 million was deployed during that week—down from $705.7 million the week prior and $1.31 billion in early May. K33: MSTR Premium Shrinks as Bitcoin Treasury Race Heats Up K33 Head of Research Vetle Lunde attributes the deceleration to two key factors: a declining premium for MSTR shares relative to the firm’s Bitcoin holdings, and intensifying competition among corporations entering the Bitcoin treasury space. “The pace of ATM utilization is notably slower than the first round,” Lunde noted. Between early November and mid-December, Strategy raised an average of $2.13 billion weekly. In contrast, recent averages have dropped to $788 million. MSTR shares, once trading at a hefty premium to the company’s net Bitcoin asset value, have seen that margin shrink. Last week, the premium fell from 185% to 163%, marking lows not seen since early April. According to Lunde, such compression pressures Strategy to dial back aggressive ATM offerings, lest dilution undermine investor confidence. Meanwhile, more than 70 companies have now adopted Bitcoin treasury strategies, with firms like Twenty One, Nakamoto, Metaplanet, and Trump Media joining the ranks. Trump Media alone launched its treasury push with a $2.5 billion private placement backed by roughly 50 institutions. As the field widens, Lunde suggests traders are spreading bets beyond MSTR, diminishing some of its dominance in equity-based Bitcoin exposure. PRESS RELEASE: K33 secures financing of SEK 60 million to buy bitcoin and launch its Bitcoin Treasury Strategy. Read the press release here: https://t.co/zRPFCWag5P pic.twitter.com/qAha0lpKnt — K33 (@K33HQ) May 28, 2025 Despite this, Strategy’s stash now totals 580,250 BTC, valued at $63.3 billion—accounting for over 2.75% of Bitcoin’s capped 21 million supply. With BTC trading near record highs, demand for Bitcoin treasury firms remains strong. Still, Lunde cautions that most new entrants are niche players, unlikely to disrupt bitcoin’s broader momentum. “Signs of euphoria are still subdued in spot and derivatives markets,” he said. “Aside from MSTR, most treasury stocks reflect limited segments of the BTC ecosystem.” Strategy Could Become Top Publicly Traded Company in World Meanwhile, Jeff Walton, an analyst at Strategy, has said the firm may one day rise to become the top publicly traded company in the world. Walton believes the company’s unprecedented exposure to Bitcoin, which recently crossed $111,000, gives it a unique edge. “Strategy holds more of the best asset and most pristine collateral on the planet than any other company, by multiples,” he said.

The bonds are worth a combined value of $50 million. According to the company’s recent announcement , the Japanese investment firm has decided to issue the 16th series of ordinary bonds to the venture capital firm EVO FUND. With a combined total value of $50 million, this is the largest ordinary bond issuance made by the Tokyo-based company so far. Following the same pattern as previous bond issuances, the company declared that it would use the funds to purchase more Bitcoin ( BTC ). As of May 19, the investment firm holds 7,800 BTC which brings the company’s total Bitcoin investments to $846.9 million based on current market prices. Metaplanet chief executive Simon Gerovich had declared that the company aims to amass 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025. After its latest purchase of 1,004 BTC on May 19, Metaplanet has reached 78% of that target, making it one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders in Asia.

However, EVO FUND is granted the option to redeem the bonds before the redemption date by providing a written notice to Metaplanet at least five business day before the desired early redemption date. Early redemption can be made for all or part of the outstanding bonds. If Metaplanet decides to hold a separate fundraising initiative in the future involving EVO Fund then the amount of U.S. dollars paid by EVO FUND to Metaplanet could change depending on the fundraising result. If the funds raised on or after the issuance date reaches a multiple of $1.25 million, which is the face value of one bond, Metaplanet is allowed to redeem the same number of bonds by the multiplier at $1 per $1 of face value on the next trading day.

2025-05-28T11:42:17.000Z,"Trump’s CFTC Nominee Brian Quintenz Reveals $3.4M Crypto Holdings","The post Trump’s CFTC Nominee Brian Quintenz Reveals $3.4M Crypto Holdings appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Brian Quintenz, is drawing attention with his extensive crypto industry connections and over $3.4 million in related assets. These disclosures, revealed in a recent ethics filing, have raised questions about how his background might influence the future of crypto regulation in the US . As the Senate prepares to vote on his confirmation, many are wondering how Quintenz’s ties to the crypto world will impact the CFTC’s direction under Trump’s pro-crypto agenda. Deep Crypto Roots: A Close Link to the Industry Brian Quintenz previously served as a CFTC commissioner from 2017 to 2021 and now leads crypto policy globally at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). He holds stakes in three a16z investment funds: CNK Fund III, CNK Seed 1 Fund, and CNK IV Fund, giving him direct involvement in the crypto market. He’s also a board member of Kalshi, a decentralized prediction market platform that recently resolved a legal dispute with the CFTC over election betting. Additionally, Quintenz owns stock and unvested options in Kalshi and Next Level Derivatives, a financial services and lending brokerage firm. These interests overlap closely with two of the CFTC’s main regulatory focus areas: crypto assets and prediction markets. Addressing Conflicts of Interest To handle concerns about potential conflicts, Quintenz sent a letter on May 21 to John Einstman, the CFTC’s Ethics Official. In it, he pledged to resign from Andreessen Horowitz if confirmed as chair, sell off conflicting assets within 90 days, and recuse himself from any matters involving a16z for two years and Kalshi for one year. He will give up unvested stock options but will keep unpaid trustee roles in two family trusts. Some observers question whether this fully resolves all conflict concerns. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Czar Talks Bitcoin’s All-Time High, Reveals Trump’s Next Crypto Move , CFTC in Transition Quintenz’s nomination comes at a turbulent time for the CFTC. Commissioners Kristin Johnson, Summer Mersinger, and Christy Goldsmith Romero have all announced plans to step down by mid-2025. Romero has called the prospect of four open commissioner seats “not a great situation.” With Trump’s administration pushing a crypto-friendly approach, these changes could reshape the CFTC’s regulatory path – and Quintenz’s leadership will be a key factor in that shift. What’s Next for Crypto Regulation? Quintenz’s appointment suggests a possible move toward friendlier crypto regulations at the CFTC, but his deep financial ties to crypto firms raise questions about impartiality and regulatory capture. His commitment to divest and recuse is important, but the crypto community and lawmakers will be watching closely to see how these promises play out in practice. The Senate’s decision on his confirmation will have a big impact on the future of US crypto regulation. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-28T11:33:13.000Z,"OKX Removes 11 Trading Pairs Including USDT/USDC in Major Reshuffle","The post OKX Removes 11 Trading Pairs Including USDT/USDC in Major Reshuffle appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Crypto exchange OKX is shaking the table with a move that’s bound to get noticed. Next week, the platform will delist 11 spot trading pairs but it’s not the obscure tokens catching headlines. It’s the delisting of USDT/USDC , a staple stablecoin-to-stablecoin pair many traders rely on, that’s turning heads. Why now? That’s the question echoing across the market – especially as OKX ramps up its U.S. expansion with licenses in 47 states and a new San Jose headquarters. The timing is too sharp to ignore. OKX Pulls the Plug on Major Trading Pairs Alongside USDT/USDC, the delisting list includes lesser-known names: ZERO/USDT and ZERO/USD PRQ/USDT and PRQ/USD IQ/USDT and IQ/USD ARTY/USDT and ARTY/USD SAMO/USDT and SAMO/USD OKX says the decision comes from a “regular review process to maintain healthy trading markets,” but gave no further insight. However, a separate statement cited two drivers: internal market monitoring and user feedback. These trading pairs have shown signs of increased volatility, lower liquidity, or poor market performance. The move reflects a commitment to “user protection and market integrity.” The community’s left reading between the lines. USDT/USDC has long served as a quick liquidity bridge between stablecoins – so it’s not a typical delisting candidate due to low volume or volatility. U.S. Expansion Meets Internal Reshuffling OKX’s U.S. strategy has been aggressive in 2025, capped by the hiring of former Barclays and Hidden Road exec Roshan Robert to lead regional operations. But behind the curtain, there’s been a shake-up. Legal transitions are underway. Global General Counsel Melissa Muehlfeld, who rose through the OKcoin ranks, has exited. It follows a string of senior departures after OKX’s $500 million settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice earlier this year. The firm’s newly appointed CLO is Linda Lacewell – former NYDFS superintendent – now tasked with overhauling legal and compliance from the inside out. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Today: Nvidia Earnings and Fed Minutes Could Shift Bitcoin Price , Proof-of-Reserves Hints at a Deeper Shift Just weeks before the delisting announcement, OKX’s April 7 snapshot revealed a 3.62% drop in USDT holdings (≈$295M) and an 8.04% drop in USDC (≈$100M). Coincidence? Possibly. But the realignment of reserves, paired with the removal of a core stablecoin pair, raises bigger questions about OKX’s evolving priorities – especially in a U.S. market under renewed regulatory scrutiny. What Traders Should Know Now All open orders tied to the affected pairs will be automatically canceled during the delisting window. Funds will still be accessible under the “Untradable” section, but OKX urges users to withdraw or convert assets before the cutoff. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-28T11:30:40.000Z,"Bitcoin whales on the move: Big liquidations trigger volatility","Bitcoin retraced back to $108,900, 0.6% down in the last 24 hours, after a crypto whale withdrew over $130.68 million worth of the crypto from Binance. According to Coinglass data, BTC’s price movements cut over $26 million from long traders and $19 million from short positions intraday. At around 6 AM UTC on Wednesday, blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain identified a transaction involving the withdrawal of 1,200 BTC, valued at over $130 million, from Binance. Market analysts suggest this move could signal expectations of a deeper correction, as the large holder may be positioning for further accumulation at lower price levels. Crypto long trader’s $626M position backfires Lookonchain also featured trader James Wynn, known on social media platform X as @JamesWynnReal, who took a massive long position worth $626 million on Tuesday, with a liquidation price set at $108,010. When Bitcoin dipped below $108,500 at around 3 AM, the position came under immediate pressure. Wynn was forced to trim his position by depositing over $10 million in USDC and cutting his long position, incurring an initial loss of approximately $4.75 million. Over the course of the day, Wynn’s total losses from long trimming amounted to roughly $14.3 million. Bitcoin rebounded shortly after the sell-off, returning to values north of $109,000. Is the Whale Hunt Underway? $BTC just dropped 1.2%, and top trader @JamesWynnReal reacted fast — depositing 10.88M $USDC into Hyperliquid in the past hour and cutting part of his $PEPE long at a loss to avoid liquidation on his $BTC position. Current position: 6,680… pic.twitter.com/2MXNsNMpTP — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 26, 2025 Undeterred by his earlier loss, Wynn appeared to reposition for another push. Lookonchain tracked his activity as he deposited the remaining 203.73 billion $PEPE, valued at around $2.82 million, to Binance. Later, reports indicated that he sold a larger portion, totaling 240 billion $PEPE for $3.32 million, likely to fund an additional long position in Bitcoin. Wynn is seemingly struggling with market timing. However, another trader identified only by the address 0x2258 has reportedly been mirroring Wynn’s trades but in reverse. When Wynn goes long, 0x2258 goes short, and vice versa. Over just three days, this contrarian approach has netted him a profit of $5.6 million. On May 24, while Wynn went long on Bitcoin, 0x2258 opened short positions on both BTC and ETH. By May 25, as Wynn closed his longs, 0x2258 exited his shorts, pocketing $1.36 million in profits. When Wynn flipped to a short position later that day, 0x2258 went long again and exited the next day for a further $2.54 million in gains. When Wynn returned to a long position on May 26, 0x2258 flipped back to shorts. At press time, those short positions show an unrealized gain of $1.7 million. In another development, two newly created wallets were observed withdrawing a combined 4,838 ETH, worth about $13 million, from Kraken early Wednesday. The motive behind the move is not yet clear, but market watchers believe whales are accumulating coins, optimistic of a market price rise in the coming days. Whale numbers on the rise after old coins move According to Glassnode data, spending by long-dormant Bitcoin holders is on the rise. Total aggregate volume from the 1 to 5-year holding cohorts has reached $4.02 billion, the highest since February. Spending by older $BTC holders is heating up again.

2025-05-28T11:30:00.000Z,"Avalanche price prediction 2025-2031: Time to buy AVAX?","Key takeaways: Our Avalanche price prediction anticipates a high of $33.36 in 2025. In 2027, it will range between $59.93 and $71.39, with an average price of $61.59. In 2031, it will range between $267.69 and $326.17, with an average price of $277.23. AVAX exhibited wild price swings in 2024. This record came as the crypto market valuation peaked. It later reversed, shedding some of the profits in 2025. While the Avalanche ecosystem has been making strides, the AVAX price has left investors particularly questioning its trajectory. Will AVAX go up? Is AVAX a good investment? Let’s explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Avalanche Symbol AVAX Current price $23.44 Market cap $9.87B Trading volume $352.23M Circulating supply 421.15M All-time high $146.22 on Nov 21, 2021 All-time low $2.79 on Dec 31, 2020 24-hour high $23.86 24-hour low $23.11 Avalanche price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 7.36% 50-day SMA $21.83 200-day SMA $25.78 Sentiment Neutral Green days 14/30 (47%) Avalanche price analysis: AVAX in consolidation phase As of May 28, AVAX’s price dropped by 1.78% in 24 hours and rose 5.24% in the last 30 days. Its trading volume dropped by 5.01% in 24 hours. AVAX/USD 1-day chart analysis AVAX/USD 1-day chart AVAX was in an ascending channel in the last quarter of 2024. The trend reversed in December, after reaching a high of $55.41 on Christmas Eve. The drop continued into 2025 and is yet to reverse. Last week, the coin attempted a recovery which saw it rise from a low of $19.09 to as high as $26.84. The William Alligator trendlines now show that its volatility has dropped. The relative strength index is at 52.97 in neutral territory, with the MACD histogram showing little market momentum. It is considered overbought when the RSI value rises above 70. AVAX/USD 4-hour chart analysis AVAX/USD 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart highlights AVAX’s current run, which is moving sideways. Earlier, it had risen to $26.84 before correcting. Like the daily chart, its RSI is in neutral territory at 51.33. The William Alligator trendlines show little market volatility.

The combination of technical indicators and chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is consolidating with no clear direction for the next breakout. Recent news Filecoin Foundation and Avalanche have partnered to launch a new cross-chain data bridge. The bridge will allow developers to build on Avalanche’s C-Chain to store data on Filecoin’s decentralized network. Why is AVAX down? AVAX is correcting from its highest last year; the crypto market capitalization is also bearish. The drop in AVAX value could be attributed to the general market sentiment. Will AVAX reach $50? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX crossed the $50 mark in 2027. Will AVAX reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX will reach $100 in 2028, with a maximum price of $106.00 for the year. Can Avalanche reach $1,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $1,000 mark before 2031. At that market capitalization, it could be more valuable than Ethereum. Can Avalanche reach $10,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $10,000 mark before 2031. How much will Avalanche be worth in 2025? As the second half of 2025 unfolds, we anticipate it will trade between $19.06 and $33.36, with an average price of $29.46. Does Avalanche have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, AVAX will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or negative regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is Avalanche a good crypto to buy? Chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is recovering and currently gearing up for a closer move to $27 despite the overall bearish momentum.

Image source: CoinStats In July 2020, Avalanche completed its public sale, raising $42 million in less than $4.5 hours. The tokens were distributed after the mainnet launch in September. On Dec 31, 2020, it fell to an all-time low of $2.788. In September 2021, the Ava Labs Foundation received a $230 million investment from Polychain and Three Arrows Capital Group by purchasing the AVAX cryptocurrency. In November 2021, following an agreement with Deloitte to improve US disaster relief funding, AVAX moved to the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. At that time, AVAX moved to its all-time high at $146.22. In Aug 2022, a whistleblower, ‘crypto leaks’, published a report accusing Ava Labs of secret deals with a law firm to destabilize its competitors. Ava Labs CEO Emin Gün Sirer denied any dirty deal with Roche Freedmen law firm. In 2023, AVAX maintained a bullish trend between January and May, after which bears overwhelmed the market. It resumed the positive momentum in October, rising to $49.96 In 2024, it crossed the $60 mark in March. The rise coincided with a record high in AVAX inscriptions, with over 100 million ASC-20 minted since their introduction in June 2023. The uptrend reversed in April 2024; by July, it had fallen to $24.40. In August, it was at $21, and in September and October, it was at $27. It turned bullish in November 2024, rising from as low as $23 to as high as $55 in December. It later corrected and traded at $42 into 2025. The drop continued into January; by May, it had fallen below $20.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/avalanche-price-prediction/,"AVAX|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIL|ICO|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING","Crypto Price Predictions|avax",cryptocompare
2025-05-28T11:29:07.000Z,"White House’s David Sacks Hints at Budget-Neutral Path for U.S. Bitcoin Purchases","White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks has floated the possibility of the U.S. government acquiring Bitcoin without a tax or increasing federal spending,or adding to the national debt. The suggestion came during a public panel discussion at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 27, where Sacks noted that Washington may not need to expand the federal balance sheet to begin building a strategic Bitcoin reserve. David Sacks’ Proposal Tied to Growing Institutional Bitcoin Narrative David Sacks, a senior advisor with close ties to the President and digital asset working groups, characterized the idea as “budget-neutral,” implying reallocation of existing Treasury assets rather than fresh expenditure. His comments were made alongside those of Bitcoin industry leaders during the opening day of the three-day conference, which has already drawn headline attention for hosting both Vice President JD Vance and members of the Trump family. Notably, the White House czar’s comments align with rising institutional interest in Bitcoin as a treasury asset, a theme echoed by multiple speakers across the conference. However, on the same day, it was confirmed that Trump Media had raised $2.5 billion for Bitcoin acquisition , solidifying how entities affiliated with both major U.S. political blocs are engaging with digital assets. Trump Media is diving headfirst into crypto, raising $2.5 billion to build one of the biggest Bitcoin treasuries. #TrumpMedia #Bitcoin https://t.co/Fpfqth4KCA — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 27, 2025 During the session, Sacks also referenced early discussions around so-called “bit bonds” or Bitcoin-backed instruments that could allow the federal government to build BTC exposure while remaining within existing fiscal limits. Although details remain vague, the framing suggests policymakers may be exploring creative tools that mirror strategies used by sovereign wealth funds or corporate treasuries. Sovereign Bitcoin Strategies Gain Traction Amid El Salvador’s IMF Balancing Act The concept of a U.S. sovereign Bitcoin reserve, once a fringe idea, is entering mainstream debate. David Sacks’ proposal, framed as “budget-neutral,” presents a politically palatable entry point for discussions within Treasury and Congressional committees by avoiding associations with increased public spending. If embraced, this approach would resemble strategies adopted by countries like El Salvador and Bhutan, where Bitcoin purchases have been made through internal reallocations rather than public debt. El Salvador, in particular, remains under the international spotlight for its steadfast commitment to Bitcoin. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced a staff-level agreement with the Salvadoran government as part of the first review of a $1.4 billion extended loan program. The IMF says it will “ensure” El Salvador's Bitcoin holdings remain unchanged as a condition for its $1.4b loan program, despite ongoing accumulation. #IMF #bitcoin https://t.co/yvuwmDylZ5 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 28, 2025 While the IMF praised the country’s macroeconomic stability and progress on fiscal reforms, it emphasized that El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings should remain capped. As part of the agreement, El Salvador has also committed to withdrawing public sector involvement in the Chivo wallet, the government-run Bitcoin payment app, by the end of July. This development follows comments made in April by Economy Minister Maria Luisa Hayem, who reaffirmed at the Web Summit in Rio de Janeiro that Bitcoin remains a core government priority. Despite IMF guidelines, she confirmed that the nation continues to accumulate Bitcoin. Since the IMF deal was first struck in December 2024, El Salvador has added at least 20 more Bitcoin to its treasury . As of May 2025, the country holds approximately 6,190 BTC valued at around $675 million. With Bitcoin prices surging in 2025, the nation now sits on more than $350 million in unrealized gains, according to official data .

2025-05-28T11:27:55.000Z,"Why Is Crypto Down Today? – May 28, 2025","The crypto market records another minor pullback, possibly transitioning into consolidation. 80 of the top 100 coins per market cap have decreased over the past day. At the same time, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has decreased 2.2%, currently standing at $3.55 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $116 billion, back to the level we typically see. TLDR: Crypto market rally stalls; BTC hovers around the $109,000 level; Older BTC coins are on the move; Major players remain convinced of Bitcoin’s long-term value; Digital asset investment products continue seeing significant inflows; The dip is expected, but incoming events may push the market either way. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, six of the top 10 coins per market capitalization are down over the past day, one is up, and one is unchanged. Bitcoin (BTC) hit an intraday high of $110,407, decreasing to $108,897 by the time of writing. Overall, the price is down 0.7% in a day. The coin hit its all-time high of $111,814 on 22 May, falling 2.6% since. Ethereum (ETH) is the only coin in this category that increased today. It’s up 0.5%, now trading at $2,639. The biggest decrease is Dogecoin (DOGE)’s 2.5% to the price of $0.223. Of the top 100 coins, about 20 recorded price increases. The highest gainer is Quant (QNT) . It’s up 8.9% to $115. Monero (XMR) fell the most in this category. It’s the only coin with a double-digit drop: 14.4% to the price of $334. After the volatility shook the traditional sector, investors are still (and increasingly so) turning towards crypto as a safe haven. Therefore, the current drop still suggests a typical post-rally short-term pullback. However, a number of positive news, including Circle’s IPO , did not manage to push the prices higher, so this may suggest a further downturn. That said, there are some interesting developments to observe. Bitcoin 2025 has begun, with some high-profile figures in attendance . Investors will keep an eye on this. Furthermore, El Salvador is feeling the IMF heat . The latter stated that it would work to “ensure” that the total amount of Bitcoin the government holds remains unchanged. Thank you Coach / @SenTuberville ! The pleasure was entirely mine, and thank you for your continued advocacy of US derivative markets. https://t.co/FrHNbuRJDj — Brian Quintenz (@BrianQuintenz) April 9, 2025 In the US, Brian Quintenz, US President Donald Trump’s pick for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) leader, disclosed $3.4 million in assets tied to crypto ventures. However, the outgoing CFTC Commissioner Christy Romero warned that the current trend of “big swings” between “regulation and deregulation” could obstruct the success of the nation’s financial markets. ‘Major Players Still Convinced of BTC’s Long-Term Value’ Blockchain data and intelligence provider Glassnode found that spending by older BTC holders is on the rise, and older coins are on the move again. “Aggregate volume from the 1y–5y cohorts just hit $4.02B – the highest since February,” it said on Tuesday.

What once spiked on hype is now underpinned by policy shifts, particularly in the US, institutional flows that are currently pouring money into digital assets, and a recalibrated investor mindset that favours alternatives.” “If this momentum continues, discussions of Bitcoin’s future may finally move beyond short-term concern over its inherent volatility, and instead focus on its future as a foundational asset within the global economy,” Chait says. Institutional investors continue investing in Bitcoin ETFs, but geopolitical tensions and policy uncertainty “create significant background noise, keeping some investors cautious.” That said, the “aggressive buying on any price dip shows that.” That said, today, the Glassnode analysts noted that the BTC funding rate turned negative. $BTC funding rate just flipped negative. Shorts are quietly building across the top 10, with $BNB and $ADA both showing signs of pressure.

Now standing at $108,897, the latest moves suggest consolidation. The key resistance level stands at $109,653 and $111,935 before it even attempts to take the $113,000 zone. The first support level is $108,731. Should it break that, we may see it go down to $107,078, or even $105,905. Short-term, there doesn’t appear to be a threat of BTC dropping below $100,000.

We’ll see whether these affect the market. Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? The crypto market has recorded a slight decrease today, while the stock market saw a notable uptick. The S&P 500 is up 2.05%, the Nasdaq-100 increased by 2.39%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 1.78%. The optimism rose on Wall Street as Donald Trump walked back tariff threats against the European Union and trade tensions softened. Is this dip sustainable? The market may be in a consolidation period. The market capitalization and investor interest remain robust, so major bear action seems unlikely short-term. However, with all the upcoming events, the market may be spooked by negative regulatory or macroeconomic developments.

Could this technical setup, coupled with the SEC’s review of a spot XRP ETF application by WisdomTree, signal the start of a rally to $3.40 and higher?XRP falling wedge pattern targets $3.40From a technical perspective, XRP (XRP) price could gain significant momentum if it breaks out of this falling wedge pattern.In technical analysis, a falling wedge is a bullish reversal chart pattern that comprises two converging trend lines that connect lower highs and lower lows. This convergence indicates a weakening downward momentum. XRP price is currently retesting the resistance provided by the upper trendline of the wedge at $2.42. A break above this level will likely trigger a quick rise in price, with the bulls targeting the technical target of the wedge at $3.40, a 48% increase from current prices.XRP/USD daily chart.

2025-05-28T09:59:06.000Z,"Fungible cryptos in secondary sales are not securities, Ripple tells SEC","Ripple, the blockchain company behind XRP, argued that fungible cryptocurrencies are not securities when transferred in secondary transactions in a recent letter sent to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).In its May 27 letter, Ripple cited US attorney and crypto law thought leader Lewis Cohen to support its claim. In his widely cited 2022 paper, “The Ineluctable Modality of Securities Law: Why Fungible Crypto Assets Are Not Securities,” he wrote:“[T]here is no current basis in the law relating to ‘investment contracts’ to classify most fungible crypto assets as ‘securities’ when transferred in secondary transactions.”In his paper, Cohen explained that in secondary transactions, an investment contract transaction is generally not present. He further claimed that fungible cryptocurrencies “neither create nor represent the necessary cognizable legal relationship between” a legal entity and the holder that is the “hallmark of a security.”Related: Banking groups ask SEC to drop cybersecurity incident disclosure ruleSEC’s “new paradigm”Ripple also referenced SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce's May 19 “new paradigm” speech. She said she’d been voicing her dissent with the regulator’s approach to crypto, adding:“Having emerged from the crypto dissent years, I am glad to be able speak to you today as the head of the Commission’s Crypto Task Force about a rational and coherent path forward and a new paradigm at the SEC.”Peirce said that the SEC’s “approach to crypto in recent years has evaded sound regulatory practice and must be corrected.” She also said that most cryptocurrencies are not securities, adding:“Most currently existing crypto assets in the market are not [securities]. My supplemental answer is that economic realities matter and non-security crypto assets may be distributed as part of an investment contract, which is a type of security.”Ripple’s long fight with the SECThe SEC had viewed a large portion of digital assets as securities, with the regulator’s former chair, Gary Gensler, stating in 2023 that most of the crypto market falls under the securities bracket. This stance led to a protracted legal battle between the SEC and Ripple.The lawsuit first began at the end of 2020, when the SEC took action against Ripple and its executives, claiming that XRP sales constituted unregistered security offerings. Still, after the government’s stance on crypto changed with the election of current US President Donald Trump, Ripple has mostly won the battle, with the SEC recently dropping its appeal against a ruling favorable to the company.In its recent letter to the SEC, Ripple also cited a ruling in the case noting that “the court held that certain of Ripple’s historical institutional sales of XRP were investment contracts,” while the secondary sales were not. Furthermore, the judge “determined that XRP itself is not a security.”Magazine: XRP win leaves Ripple and industry with no crypto legal precedent set",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-sec-letter-crypto-not-securities?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

However, the company noted it would disclose further developments if needed.  Metaplanet’s push into Bitcoin highlights a growing trend among companies seeking alternatives to fiat-based treasury strategies. The move follows Metaplanet’s second-biggest BTC purchase, scooping up 1,004 Bitcoin worth over $100 million. This pushed the company’s Bitcoin holdings to 7,800 BTC, worth over $800 million. According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET, Metaplanet is up by nearly 20% on its Bitcoin investments. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin strategy has also given its stock prices a boost. On May 27, 10x Research reported that Metaplanet’s stock trades as if Bitcoin were worth five times its actual price. The research company said investors in the company are “dramatically overpaying for their Bitcoin exposure.”Related: Bitcoin treasury pivot lifts luxury watchmaker’s stock more than 60%Bitcoin Treasury strategy attracts criticismWith the rise of Bitcoin treasury companies’ stock prices, getting Bitcoin exposure through corporate wrappers has attracted criticism from well-known investor Jim Chanos. At the Sohn Investment Conference in New York, Chanos said he’s selling MicroStrategy stock to buy Bitcoin. Chanos’ move assumes investors are overpaying for BTC exposure through MicroStrategy and other firms that follow the same blueprint. The investor’s move assumes that purchasing Bitcoin directly would be better than purchasing stocks for indirect Bitcoin exposure. Magazine: Can Off the Grid survive Steam’s crypto ban?

Five commissioners are supposed to make up the CFTC, and no more than three can be from the same political party.Goldsmith Romero said that during her tenure, all the commissioners had different perspectives and experiences that, when brought together, were “really helpful.”“So what happens if the CFTC gets down to one and gets new authority for crypto? It’s going to be really, really hard; you’re not going to have the same push and pull,” she said.The Trump administration has floated the idea of handing the reins of crypto regulation to the CFTC in the past.

2025-05-28T02:11:48.000Z,"Real-world assets could revitalize dying NFT lending market: DappRadar","Real-world assets linking up with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is one of a few key catalysts that could reignite the waning NFT lending sector, which is suffering from a collapse in volumes and user activity, says blockchain analytics platform DappRadar.Volumes in the NFT lending market, which allows NFT holders to take out a loan against their token, have dropped 97% from a peak of around $1 billion in January 2024 to $50 million in May, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a May 27 report.Gherghelas said for NFT lending to “move beyond survival mode,” it needs “new catalysts” to reignite the sector, such as real-world asset NFTs, like tokenized real estate or yield-bearing assets that could unlock more stable, trusted collateral sources.“So far, 2025 has not delivered a compelling reason for NFT lending to bounce back,” she said. “While the infrastructure is still here and the platforms remain active, activity has slowed across the board.” Borrower and leading activity have taken a big hit in the NFT lending sector. Source: DappRadar“For now, the sector seems to be in a holding pattern, waiting either for market recovery or a new use case to reignite interest.”Gherghelas added that other catalysts that could rekindle NFT lending were tools that make it easier for NFT holders to borrow against their tokens, and that protocols should create “smart infrastructure” such as undercollateralized loans, credit scores and artificial intelligence risk matching.The report adds that since January last year, borrower activity has declined by 90% and those willing to lend have shrunk by 78%.The average NFT loan size has also taken a hit from a peak of $22,000 in 2022 to $4,000 in May, a 71% year-over-year drop.Gherghelas said this shift “shows that either users are borrowing against lower-value assets or simply becoming more conservative with leverage.”NFT lending overall trading volume and market activity have dropped off from the all-time highs of past years. Source: DappRadarThe average loan duration is also lower; after hitting an average of roughly 40 days in 2023, it’s been down to 31 days and has held steady throughout 2024 and into 2025.Gherghelas said this could indicate that “loans are being taken more frequently but for shorter periods, perhaps a sign of more tactical liquidity plays.”NFT ﻿market downturn also hurts lendingPart of the slowdown in NFT lending is connected to the overall NFT market decline, which has seen volumes drop 61% in the first quarter to $1.5 billion compared to $4.1 billion a year ago.“With collateral value collapsing, the lending activity naturally followed,” Gherghelas said. “There are a few exceptions that managed to hold or regain traction, but they’ve been outliers, not enough to lift the sector.”Related: AI decentralized apps are coming for the Web3 throne: DappRadarThe protocol landscape has also narrowed, and the number of active NFT lending apps is limited, with only eight protocols holding any meaningful share.“The flip-for-liquidity model that worked during bull markets isn’t built for a quieter, more risk-averse environment. But that doesn’t mean NFT lending is finished; it’s simply shifting focus,” Gherghelas said.“Platforms are diversifying, use cases are shifting, and collateral preferences are changing. If the next wave builds on utility, culture, and better design, NFT lending might just find its second wind — one built to last.”Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-world-assets-revitalize-dying-nft-lending-dappradar?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

SharpLink will invest $425 million to acquire 120,000 ETH. Ethereum futures open interest hits an all-time high of $36.1 billion, with ETH price climbing 4.5% on the daily chart. Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming (SBET) announced a $425 million private investment in public equity (PIPE), acquiring approximately 69.1 million shares at $6.15 each to establish the first Nasdaq-listed Ethereum (ETH) treasury company.Spearheaded by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, this move mirrors Strategy’s (MSTR) successful Bitcoin treasury strategy, which has yielded over $8.2 billion in gains in 2025, by leveraging stock and bond sales to acquire BTC.Former Ethereum core developer and contributor Eric Conner highlighted the bullish implications of SharpLink’s move, noting its potential to create a “public ETH proxy for funds that can’t hold tokens directly.” Conner emphasized that the acquisition of 120,000 ETH—likely to be staked—could lead to “supply compression” by removing tokens from circulation. The Ether proponent also pointed to the “new narrative fuel” this provides, positioning ETH as a “digital reserve collateral” and potentially driving its adoption on mainstream balance sheets through an equity wrapper like $SBET.However, crypto analyst VICTOR cautioned against over-enthusiasm, outlining the risk of leveraging gains from an altcoin still down 19% in 2025. In Q1 2025, Cointelegraph reported a sharp decline in Ethereum network fees, dropping to $605,000 from $2.5 million in just two weeks in March, alongside a noticeable decrease in decentralized app (DApp) activity.

The majority of these rallies—eight out of ten—resulted in negative returns, while one rally triggered a short squeeze, driving prices higher, and another displayed neutral price action.From a technical perspective, Ether’s price action on the daily chart posted a descending triangle, a bullish breakout pattern, which creates equal highs and higher lows, converging toward an imminent rally. The pattern is bordered by two trendlines, the upper resistance, currently around $2,700 and the ascending support line. A bullish breakout above $2,677 targets the pattern’s measured move, calculated by adding the triangle’s height to the breakout point.

Speaking at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, Sigel said the most viable path forward may involve inserting Bitcoin mining incentives into the congressional budget reconciliation process.According to Sigel, the most effective path to growing a US strategic Bitcoin reserve would be through targeted amendments to congressional budget legislation. These could include tax credits for mining companies that use methane gas and other incentives aimed at encouraging miners to share a portion of their mined BTC with the federal government. He argued that such an approach would allow the reserve to grow organically over time. Sigel also highlighted the limitations of executive actions in achieving this goal:\""The problem with executive action is that it's going to prompt lawsuits. And anything over $100 million is going to get sued by the Elizabeth Warrens of the world.

Bitcoin’s bullish momentum aligns with the favorable US financial conditions, as noted by Ecoinometrics. The macroeconomic-focused Bitcoin newsletter highlighted that the National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) shows a rapid shift to ultra-loose territory after a tightening phase in February 2025. The NFCI, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, tracks stress in the financial system by aggregating measures like credit spreads, leverage, and funding conditions. When the index moves into looser territory, it reflects easier access to capital and reduced market stress—conditions that typically encourage risk-taking behavior among investors.

2025-05-27T15:40:00.000Z,"93% of all Bitcoin is already mined. Here’s what that means","How much Bitcoin is left to mine?              Bitcoin’s total supply is hardcoded at 21 million BTC, a fixed upper limit that cannot be altered without a consensus-breaking change to the protocol. This finite cap is enforced at the protocol level and is central to Bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset.As of May 2025, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoin (BTC) have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created, and those remaining coins will be mined very slowly.The reason for this uneven distribution is Bitcoin’s exponential issuance schedule, governed by an event called the halving. When Bitcoin launched in 2009, the block reward was 50 BTC. Every 210,000 blocks — or approximately every four years — that reward is cut in half. Because the early rewards were so large, over 87% of the total supply was mined by the end of 2020. Each subsequent halving sharply reduces the rate of new issuance, meaning it will take over a century to mine the remaining 6.7%.According to current estimates, 99% of all Bitcoin will have been mined by 2035, but the final fraction — the last satoshis — won’t be produced until around the year 2140 due to the nature of geometric reward reduction.This engineered scarcity, combined with an immutable supply cap, is what draws comparisons between Bitcoin and physical commodities like gold. But Bitcoin is even more predictable: Gold’s supply grows at around 1.7% annually, whereas Bitcoin’s issuance rate is transparently declining.Did you know? Bitcoin’s supply curve is not terminal in the traditional sense. It follows an asymptotic trajectory — a kind of economic Zeno’s paradox — where rewards diminish indefinitely but never truly reach zero. Mining will continue until around 2140, by which point over 99.999% of the total 21 million BTC will have been issued.                  Beyond the supply cap: How lost coins make Bitcoin scarcer than you think              While over 93% of Bitcoin’s total supply has been mined, that doesn’t mean it’s all available. A significant portion is permanently out of circulation, lost due to forgotten passwords, misplaced wallets, destroyed hard drives or early adopters who never touched their coins again.Estimates from firms like Chainalysis and Glassnode suggest that between 3.0 million and 3.8 million BTC — roughly 14%-18% of the total supply — is likely gone for good. That includes high-profile dormant addresses like the one believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, which alone holds over 1.1 million BTC.This means Bitcoin’s true circulating supply may be closer to 16 million-17 million, not 21 million. And because Bitcoin is non-recoverable by design, any lost coins stay lost — permanently reducing supply over time.Now compare that to gold. Around 85% of the world’s total gold supply has been mined — approximately 216,265 metric tons, according to the World Gold Council — but nearly all of it remains in circulation or held in vaults, jewelry, ETFs and central banks. Gold can be remelted and reused; Bitcoin cannot be resurrected once access is lost.This distinction gives Bitcoin a kind of hardening scarcity, a supply that not only stops growing over time but quietly shrinks.As Bitcoin matures, it’s entering a monetary phase similar to gold: low issuance, high holder concentration and increasing demand-side sensitivity. But Bitcoin takes it further; its supply cap is hard, its loss rate is permanent, and its distribution is publicly auditable.This may lead to several outcomes:Increased price volatility as available supply becomes more limited and sensitive to market demandHigher long-term value concentration in the hands of those who remain active and secure in their key managementA premium on liquidity, where actually spendable BTC trades at a higher effective value than dormant supply.In extreme cases, this could produce a bifurcation between “circulating BTC” and “unreachable BTC,” with the former gaining greater economic significance, particularly in times of constrained exchange liquidity or macroeconomic stress.                  What happens when Bitcoin is fully mined?              There’s a popular assumption that as Bitcoin’s block rewards shrink, the network’s security will eventually suffer. But in practice, the mining economy is far more adaptive — and much more resilient — than that.Bitcoin’s mining incentives are governed by a self-correcting feedback loop: If mining becomes unprofitable, miners drop off the network, which in turn triggers a difficulty adjustment. Every 2,016 blocks (roughly every two weeks), the network recalibrates mining difficulty using a parameter known as nBits. The goal is to keep block times steady at around 10 minutes, regardless of how many miners are competing.So, if Bitcoin’s price drops, or the reward becomes too small relative to operating costs, inefficient miners simply exit. This causes difficulty to fall, lowering the cost for those who remain. The result is a system that continually rebalances itself, aligning network participation with available incentives.This mechanism has already been tested at scale. After China banned mining in mid-2021, Bitcoin’s global hashrate dropped by more than 50% in a matter of weeks. Yet the network continued to function without interruption, and within a few months, the hashrate fully recovered, as miners resumed operations in jurisdictions with lower energy costs and more favorable regulations.Critically, the idea that lower rewards will inherently threaten network security overlooks how mining is tied to profit margins, not nominal BTC amounts. As long as the market price supports the cost of hash power — even at 0.78125 BTC per block (post-2028 halving) or lower — miners will continue to secure the network.In other words, it’s not the absolute reward that matters, but whether mining remains profitable relative to costs. And thanks to Bitcoin’s built-in difficulty adjustment, it usually does.Even a century from now, when the block reward approaches zero, the network will likely still be protected by whatever combination of fees, base incentives and infrastructure efficiency exists at that time. But that’s a distant concern. In the meantime, the current system — hashrate adjusts, difficulty rebalances, miners adapt — remains one of the most robust elements of Bitcoin’s design.Did you know? On April 20, 2024, following the launch of the Runes protocol, Bitcoin miners earned over $80 million in transaction fees within a single day, surpassing the $26 million earned from block rewards. This marked the first time in Bitcoin’s history that transaction fees alone exceeded the block subsidy in daily miner revenue.                  The future of Bitcoin mining: Energy consumption              It’s a common misconception that rising Bitcoin prices will drive endless energy use. In reality, mining is constrained by profitability, not price alone.As block rewards shrink, miners are pushed toward thinner margins, and that means chasing the cheapest, cleanest energy available. Since China’s 2021 mining ban, hashrate has migrated to regions like North America and Northern Europe, where operators tap into surplus hydro, wind and underutilized grid energy.According to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, between 52% and 59% of Bitcoin mining now runs on renewables or low-emission sources. Regulations are reinforcing this trend, with several jurisdictions offering incentives for clean-powered mining or penalizing fossil-fuel operations.Moreover, the idea that higher BTC prices will always mean higher energy use misses how Bitcoin self-regulates: More miners raise difficulty, which compresses margins, capping energy expansion. Renewable-based mining brings its own challenges, but the dystopian future of endlessly expanding fossil-fueled hash power is increasingly unlikely.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/93-of-all-bitcoin-is-already-mined-heres-what-that-means?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T15:00:00.000Z,"ZKPs can prove I&#039;m old enough without telling you my age","Opinion by: Andre Omietanski, General Counsel, and Amal Ibraymi, Legal Counsel at Aztec LabsWhat if you could prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthday, name, or anything else at all? Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) make this hypothetical a reality and solve one of the key challenges online: verifying age without sacrificing privacy. The need for better age verification todayWe're witnessing an uptick in laws being proposed restricting minors' access to social media and the internet, including in Australia, Florida, and China. To protect minors from inappropriate adult content, platform owners and governments often walk a tightrope between inaction and overreach. For example, the state of Louisiana in the US recently enacted a law meant to block minors from viewing porn. Sites required users to upload an ID before viewing content. The Free Speech Coalition challenged the law as unconstitutional, making the case that it infringed on First Amendment rights. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed on procedural grounds. The reaction, however, highlights the dilemma facing policymakers and platforms: how to block minors without violating adults' rights or creating new privacy risks.Traditional age verification failsCurrent age verification tools are either ineffective or invasive. Self-declaration is meaningless, since users can simply lie about their age. ID-based verification is overly invasive. No one should be required to upload their most sensitive documents, putting themselves at risk of data breaches and identity theft. Biometric solutions like fingerprints and face scans are convenient for users but raise important ethical, privacy, and security concerns. Biometric systems are not always accurate and may generate false positives and negatives. The irreversible nature of the data, which can't be changed like a regular password can, is also less than ideal. Other methods, like behavioral tracking and AI-driven verification of browser patterns, are also problematic, using machine learning to analyze user interactions and identify patterns and anomalies, raising concerns of a surveillance culture.ZKPs as the privacy-preserving solutionZero-knowledge proofs present a compelling solution. Like a government ID provider, a trusted entity verifies the user's age and generates a cryptographic proof confirming they are over the required age. Websites only need to check the proof, not the excess personal data, ensuring privacy while keeping minors at the gates. No centralized data storage is required, alleviating the burden on platforms such as Google, Meta, and WhatsApp and eliminating the risk of data breaches. Recent: How zero-knowledge proofs can make AI fairerAdopting and enforcing ZKPs at scaleZKPs aren't a silver bullet. They can be complex to implement. The notion of \""don't trust, verify,\"" proven by indisputable mathematics, may cause some regulatory skepticism. Policymakers may hesitate to trust cryptographic proofs over visible ID verification. There are occasions when companies may need to disclose personal information to authorities, such as during an investigation into financial crimes or government inquiries. This would challenge ZKPs, whose very intention is for platforms not to hold this data in the first place.ZKPs also struggle with scalability and performance, being somewhat computationally intensive and tricky to program. Efficient implementation techniques are being explored, and breakthroughs, such as the Noir programming language, are making ZKPs more accessible to developers, driving the adoption of secure, privacy-first solutions. A safer, smarter future for age verificationGoogle's move to adopt ZKPs for age verification is a promising signal that mainstream platforms are beginning to embrace privacy-preserving technologies. But to fully realize the potential of ZKPs, we need more than isolated solutions locked into proprietary ecosystems. Crypto-native wallets can go further. Open-source and permissionless blockchain-based systems offer interoperability, composability, and programmable identity. With a single proof, users can access a range of services across the open web — no need to start from scratch every time, or trust a single provider (Google) with their credentials.ZKPs flip the script on online identity — proving what matters, without exposing anything else. They protect user privacy, help platforms stay compliant, and block minors from restricted content, all without creating new honeypots of sensitive data.Google's adoption of ZKPs shows mainstream momentum is building. But to truly transform digital identity, we must embrace crypto-native, decentralized systems that give users control over what they share and who they are online.In an era defined by surveillance, ZKPs offer a better path forward — one that's secure, private, and built for the future.Opinion by: Andre Omietanski, General Counsel, and Amal Ibraymi, Legal Counsel at Aztec Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-27T14:30:00.000Z,"What is a cryptocurrency mixer and how does it work?","Cryptocurrency mixers explained              A cryptocurrency mixer is a specialized service designed to increase the privacy and anonymity of blockchain transactions. Unlike traditional financial transactions, which are private by default, most cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) operate on public blockchains. This means every transaction is permanently recorded and accessible to anyone, making it possible for blockchain analysts or malicious actors to trace the flow of funds between wallets.A crypto mixer’s primary function is to break the link between the sender’s wallet and the recipient’s wallet. It does so by pooling together coins from many users and then redistributing them in a way that makes it difficult to track which coins went where. Think of it like a digital version of shuffling cards in a deck. After mixing, your cryptocurrency is returned to you or a recipient’s address, but it’s “cleaned” of any direct transaction history.This privacy-enhancing feature is why some people rely on mixers, especially those seeking to keep their financial activities confidential in an open-ledger world.                  How does a crypto mixer work?              To understand a crypto mixer, it’s useful to compare it to the concept of money laundering in traditional finance, albeit with legal and ethical nuances. The process of “mixing” is essentially designed to obscure the origin and destination of coins.Here’s a typical workflow of how a cryptocurrency mixer operates:Deposit: You send your cryptocurrency to the mixer’s wallet address. Multiple users do the same, creating a large pool of coins.Mixing/shuffling: The mixer’s system pools and shuffles these coins together, breaking any visible connection between deposited and withdrawn funds.Redistribution: After mixing, the service sends back an equivalent amount of coins to your specified address, but these aren’t the same coins you deposited. They come from the pooled coins of all participants.Fees: The mixer usually deducts a small fee, generally ranging from 1% to 3%, to cover operational costs.This process effectively disrupts blockchain analysis, making it extremely difficult for anyone to trace the coins back to their original owners.                  Types of cryptocurrency mixers              Not all mixers are created equal. They can broadly be divided into two categories: centralized and decentralized mixers.Centralized mixersCentralized mixers are the most common and operate similarly to traditional services. You send your coins to a company or entity that controls the mixing process, and then they send back “clean” coins after mixing. These services are relatively easy to use, often providing a simple user interface.However, centralized mixers require you to trust the service operator with your coins, at least temporarily. This introduces risks such as:The mixer could be a scam and disappear with your funds.It could be hacked, exposing users’ data and coins.The operator may keep logs that could compromise your privacy.Decentralized mixersDecentralized mixers use blockchain technology and smart contracts to automate the mixing process without a trusted third party. They rely on cryptographic methods such as zero-knowledge proofs to mix coins in a trustless environment. Users pool their coins into a smart contract, which then redistributes coins in a way that ensures privacy.Advantages of decentralized mixers include:No central point of failure or custody risk.Higher privacy because no single party controls the funds.Often more resistant to regulatory crackdowns.Did you know? The DOJ indicted four Russians for operating crypto mixers Blender.io and Sinbad.io, yet failed to show they knowingly laundered illicit funds. The indictment relies heavily on vague forum posts and lacks concrete evidence of criminal intent or ties to US commerce, raising serious doubts about its strength in court.                  Real-world cases involving mixers and scams              Unfortunately, the privacy offered by crypto mixers has also attracted criminals. The very anonymity that protects innocent users can also shield illicit activities, leading to widespread misuse.Crypto mixers have been linked to ransomware attacks, dark web marketplaces, fraud and drug trafficking. Criminals often use these services to “clean” proceeds from illegal transactions and hide their tracks from law enforcement.A notable example is ChipMixer, a service seized by Europol in 2023 for allegedly facilitating money laundering for dark web markets and ransomware groups. Authorities dismantled the platform’s infrastructure over alleged money laundering, seizing four servers, 1,909.4 BTC (about $210 million as of May 26, 2025) and seven TB of data across 55 transactions.Mixers have also been involved in laundering stolen funds from cryptocurrency exchange hacks. The complexity of these transactions makes it difficult for investigators to recover stolen assets.In February 2025, Bybit, a major cryptocurrency exchange, suffered a significant security breach resulting in the theft of about $1.5 billion worth of cryptocurrencies. The attackers, attributed to the Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking organization, employed various crypto mixers, including Wasabi, CryptoMixer, Railgun and Tornado Cash, to launder portions of the stolen assets. Despite efforts to trace the funds, a significant portion remains unaccounted for, highlighting the challenges posed by mixers in cybersecurity investigations.                  Are crypto mixers legal?              The legal status of cryptocurrency mixers depends largely on the jurisdiction and context of their use.Most governments impose strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing regulations on financial services, including digital currency services. Mixers, by their nature, complicate AML compliance because they obscure transaction trails.For instance,In the European Union, the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD) includes digital currency providers under its regulatory scope, requiring them to perform KYC checks and report suspicious activity.In the United States, FinCEN classifies cryptocurrency mixers as money transmitters, requiring registration and compliance with AML regulations. Unlicensed mixers can face severe penalties and criminal charges.Legal uses vs misuseUsing a mixer for privacy reasons is not inherently illegal. However, if mixers are used to launder proceeds from crimes, authorities will prosecute offenders. Similarly, operating a mixer without appropriate licenses or regulatory oversight can be illegal.If you choose to use a mixer, make sure you understand the legal implications in your country and avoid any activity that could be linked to money laundering or fraud.Did you know? Crypto mixer transactions are still taxable. Using a mixer doesn’t hide gains from tax authorities; failing to report them can trigger audits or penalties. Always keep records and understand your local tax obligations.                  How to stay safe and avoid scam-linked mixers              If you decide to use a cryptocurrency mixer, your safety and security should be paramount. Here are some essential tips to avoid scams and legal troubles:Choose reputable mixers: Conduct thorough research. Look for mixers with good reviews, transparent operations and clear compliance policies.Avoid unknown or suspicious services: Steer clear of mixers linked to scams, hacks or regulatory actions.Check for licensing and compliance: Prefer mixers that comply with AML/KYC regulations, especially if you are a business or high-value user.Understand fees and timelines: Be clear on the fees involved and the expected time for your funds to be returned after mixing.Use hardware wallets and strong security practices: Always safeguard your private keys and use hardware wallets to minimize risks.Stay updated on regulations: Laws surrounding crypto mixers evolve rapidly. Staying informed will help you avoid inadvertent legal violations.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-mixer-and-how-does-it-work?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T12:00:15.000Z,"StarkWare launches mobile-friendly zero-knowledge prover","Blockchain company StarkWare has unveiled zero-knowledge (ZK) prover STARK Two (S-two), enabling enhanced privacy and verification on everyday devices like phones, laptops and browsers. The company said the new ZK prover allows users to generate complex cryptographic proofs from the client side. This means users can generate ZK-proofs directly on their devices instead of relying on a server or cloud infrastructure, opening the door for faster and more private applications across the internet. “S-two will bring STARK proving to everyday devices, and open the door for new real-world proving use cases,” said Eli Ben-Sasson, StarkWare co-founder and CEO, adding that the tool could empower the next wave of ZK applications. The company said the ZK prover is now available in public alpha and is set to roll out on Starknet, its Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, later this year.  StarkWare says new ZK prover is 39 times faster than old solutions StarkWare said that benchmark tests for the S-two ZK prover showed that it was 39 times faster than previous solutions. The performance leap enables smoother experiences in privacy-enhancing applications. The upgrade also allows use cases in private transactions, ZK-based identity and verifiable artificial intelligence. StarkWare said S-two runs on CPUs, GPUs and will soon be on browsers. “For years we’ve called the prover our magic wand, a tool that transforms complex computation into a simple proof,” Ben-Sasson said. “Now, the wand has become a lightsaber in your pocket, something anyone can wield, instantly, from your own device.”According to StarkWare, developers can build with S-two, adding that its alpha release supports hardware targets. Furthermore, the company said ZK ecosystem participants like Kakarot, Nexus, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs have already adopted the technology. Kakarot uses S-two inside ETHProofs to generate Ethereum block proofs more efficiently, while Nexus is standardizing RISC-V traces to align with S-two’s architecture. Meanwhile, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs are adding GPU acceleration to push the prover’s performance even further.Use cases for S-two zero-knowledge proverStarkWare chief operating officer Oren Katz told Cointelegraph that S-two marks a shift in how ZK-proofs are used in daily lives. Generating validity proofs directly in devices will allow privacy-preserving features in messaging, payments and digital identity. “You can prove a payment was valid without showing your balance, or verify identity without revealing personal details,” Katz added. Katz said that even salary payments could be made onchain with full transparency and no exposure of sensitive information. He dubbed the development a “big step toward bringing zero-knowledge tech into the mainstream.”Beyond privacy, Katz said, local proof generation also unlocks use cases in other industries. The executive told Cointelegraph that it can allow gamers to play offline and later generate cryptographic proof of their achievements. “An operator, instead of running all logic onchain to prove integrity, can run it on their own servers and simply generate a proof that it was executed correctly,” Katz added.Related: Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden’s cashless-society rethinkNew ZK prover follows Ethereum’s privacy pushThe launch of StarWare’s upgraded ZK prover follows Ethereum’s push for better privacy.

Subscriptions to BGUSD can be made using either USDC (USDC) or USDt (USDT), and the asset is redeemable back to USDC on demand.The company said the yield is derived from a basket of tokenized instruments, including US Treasury bills and high-grade money-market funds. “These assets are managed via partnerships with regulated institutional tokenization providers such as Superstate,” Bitget CEO Gracy Chen told Cointelegraph.The product’s structure is designed to reduce exposure to crypto volatility while delivering returns through traditional financial instruments. Bitget to roll out third-party attestationsIn response to questions about transparency, Chen said that Bitget is preparing to roll out third-party attestations to provide visibility into BGUSD’s asset backing.“Transparency and accountability are core principles of BGUSD’s framework,” she said. “While independent attestations are in the works, our institutional partners are already subject to rigorous audit requirements and regulatory oversight.”Chen clarified how Bitget maintains liquidity for users who want to redeem BGUSD. The executive said Bitget directly manages the reserve pool, which includes stable, on-hand assets like USDC. According to Chen, BGUSD does not fall under the definitions of a stablecoin or a security and is not subject to specific licensing requirements. “It’s structured as a yield-bearing stable asset certificate that’s exclusive to the Bitget platform,” Chen told Cointelegraph.Chen added that Bitget will limit access to BGUSD in jurisdictions where digital asset restrictions apply.

2025-05-27T08:45:00.000Z,"How central banks are testing blockchain-based monetary policy","Why are central banks looking at blockchains?              Central banks are tiptoeing into the world of blockchain not because it is fashionable but because every part of the money-making machine, from settlement rails to asset custody, is slowly being rewritten as code.The financial industry is already tokenizing money-market funds, Treasurys and even bank deposits. According to the Atlantic Council, 134 jurisdictions are studying or piloting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), up from just 35 in 2020. Meanwhile, commercial banks have begun to warn that if they cannot move tokenized deposits across public blockchains such as Solana or private ledgers like R3 Corda, they risk being left behind.From a central bank’s vantage point, two questions matter:First, can traditional operations, such as open-market purchases, standing facilities and reserve remuneration still work if reserves and government bonds become smart tokens? Second, can monetary transmission improve when policy logic is hard-wired into code? These questions motivate pilots such as Project Pine, Project Guardian in Singapore, the Bank of England’s wholesale CBDC sandbox and Japan’s multiyear retail CBDC pilot.                  What is “tokenized” monetary policy?              Tokenized monetary policy means that the liabilities and assets a central bank uses to steer short-term interest rates exist as programmable tokens on a distributed-ledger platform. In such a token arrangement, what the BIS describes as an ecosystem where money and securities share a common ledger, monetary functions are executed by smart contracts, replacing the traditional batch file processes used in overnight real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems.In practice, each policy tool is expressed as code:Interest on reserves becomes an automated coupon that accrues to a wallet address once a block closes.Repo and reverse-repo agreements become conditional asset swaps that self-liquidate at maturity.Collateral haircuts are numeric parameters the central bank can toggle in real time, with changes propagating instantly to all counterparties.Project Pine demonstrated all three, using ERC-20 tokens for reserves and securities on a permissioned Ethereum-compatible chain.But how is tokenized monetary policy different from traditional monetary policy?Traditional policy operations rely on central bank systems such as Fedwire or the Bank of England’s RTGS. These systems close overnight, settle in discrete batches and require multiple human sign-offs. A tokenized system settles atomically in seconds, keeps an immutable audit trail and lets policy adjustments propagate without waiting for dealers to book trades. The BIS paper on tokenisation notes that combining assets and settlement on a single ledger can shrink operational risk and latency.Did you know? A repo is a short-term secured loan in which one party sells securities and agrees to repurchase them later at a higher price. In contrast, a reverse repo is the same transaction viewed from the counterparty’s perspective (buying the securities and later reselling them).                  What is Project Pine?              Project Pine is a research initiative led by the BIS Innovation Hub and the New York Fed that explores how central banks could run monetary policy in a future where money and government securities are digital tokens managed on blockchain-like systems.Launched in late 2024 and published in May 2025, the project built a working prototype, a “starter kit” for central banks, designed to test whether tools like interest on reserves, repo operations and asset purchases can be run using smart contracts.The project ran simulated financial scenarios, mimicking both calm and crisis conditions:Normal conditions: The smart contract automatically conducted a one-day reverse-repo, draining reserves by posting bids at a pre-set interest rate.Liquidity shock: When simulated market stress pushed interest rates too high, an emergency lending facility kicked in automatically, within seconds, helping stabilize rates.Asset-purchase program: The toolkit accepted bids, calculated allocations and settled trades between digital reserves and tokenized bonds instantly.These scenarios were run in a test environment with simulated commercial banks and a programmable blockchain platform. Everything from interest payments to collateral valuation was automated, providing a glimpse into how monetary policy might function in a 24/7, tokenized financial system.This was not an isolated experiment. Other central banks are running parallel pilots that explore similar ground with their distinct approaches:Although temporarily offline as of May 24, 2025, MAS news releases show that Singapore’s Project Guardian has tested tokenized deposits and government bonds in live repo transactions, proving that interbank settlement can occur on a shared DLT without sending payments through Swift.Meanwhile, the Bank of England has taken a dual-rail approach. A July 2024 discussion paper stresses that wholesale tokenized money could sit alongside RTGS balances, letting commercial banks pick whichever rail meets their liquidity needs. Governor Andrew Bailey has warned that if tokenized deposits stall, the Bank “must continue to prepare for a wholesale CBDC.”On the retail front, Japan’s multi-year programme has entered a live “pilot” phase, constructing an end-to-end infrastructure, from smartphone wallets to a central ledger, capable of handling tens of thousands of transactions per second. The pilot also explores privacy-enhancing overlays, reflecting consumer expectations for cash-like anonymity.Taken together, these pilots confirm that key features like programmability, real-time visibility, and atomic settlement are no longer theoretical — they work. They don’t yet answer the more challenging question: How do central banks transition an entire financial system to such rails without disrupting credit creation and intermediation?Did you know? Project Pine’s digital monetary system is built like a three-layer cake: The bottom layer is a programmable blockchain (Besu), the middle is packed with tokenized money and assets (like ERC-20 reserves) and the top layer runs the smart contracts that carry out monetary policy actions.                  Why is Project Pine important?              Project Pine is the first of its kind to show that core central bank tools could be rebuilt using smart contracts. It proves that:Policy tools can be deployed faster, possibly within seconds.Facilities like repo or asset purchases can adapt automatically to changing market conditions.Tokenization could streamline operations, reduce friction and offer greater flexibility.Who was involved in Project Pine experiments?Seven major central banks, including those of Australia, Canada, England, Mexico, Switzerland, the EU and the US, collaborated on shaping the toolkit and defining test requirements. The findings don’t commit any of these banks to adopt such systems, but they provide a solid foundation for future research and policymaking.What did Project Pine test?To see how well the system works, Project Pine ran tests based on real-world situations, such as raising interest rates or a government debt crisis. They tried short and long periods, small and large financial systems, tight and loose money conditions and different ways of lending (like bank loans or corporate bonds). This helped check if the system could handle all kinds of economic ups and downs.Did you know? In Project Pine, central bank operations like paying interest on reserves or managing collateral aren’t done manually; they're handled by smart contracts coded directly into the top “protocol layer” of the blockchain stack.                  Practical design challenges in tokenized monetary policy              As central banks explore moving policy tools onto blockchains, they face several significant design hurdles. These aren’t just technical. They’re legal, operational and even philosophical. Here are the key ones:Interoperability: Can different blockchains talk to each other? Today’s financial system is like a highway with shared rules. However, blockchain ecosystems are more like separate islands, each with its own rules and roads. Public networks like Solana, private ones like Corda, or permissioned platforms like Besu don’t always “talk” to each other smoothly. This can cause issues like payment delays or funds getting stuck between platforms. Experts also warn that if too many users gather around one dominant blockchain, it could create unhealthy concentration, making the whole system more fragile.Legal finality: Does blockchain data legally count? Many countries still treat blockchain records as transaction evidence, not legally binding proof of ownership. So, even if a tokenized treasury bond moves onchain, the law might still require a separate “golden record” kept offchain by a trusted authority. Until legal systems catch up, this split could limit how far tokenized finance can go.Cyber resilience: What happens when something goes wrong? Blockchain systems run on code, and that code can have bugs. In a traditional setup, if something breaks, humans can step in. But with smart contracts, “code is law.” That’s why countries like Japan are building complete backup plans into their pilots. They’re testing how to respond to cyberattacks, technical failures or even smart contract glitches because in a digital money system, even a small error could have significant consequences.Privacy vs transparency: How much should be visible? Banks and regulators need transparency to monitor financial risks and prevent crime. But regular people want privacy, especially when using money for everyday purchases. Balancing those two needs is tricky. Policymakers are now experimenting with ideas like tiered disclosure (more visibility for big transactions), zero-knowledge proofs (which let you prove something without revealing all details), and even “anonymity vouchers” that let users make some transactions without being tracked.These challenges aren’t deal-breakers, but they do show that making money programmable isn’t as simple as flipping a switch. Central banks must work closely with lawmakers, cybersecurity experts and the financial industry to ensure tokenized monetary systems are safe, fair and reliable.                  The road ahead              The future of tokenized monetary policy will likely unfold in carefully staged phases, balancing innovation with financial stability.The BIS Innovation Hub lists more than a dozen ongoing tokenization projects from Australia’s Project Dunbar (multi-CBDC bridge) to Switzerland’s Project Helvetia (DLT-based repo). Commercial banks, meanwhile, are shifting rails: HSBC settled its first tokenized-deposit payment in April 2025, and Euroclear is piloting blockchain settlement for tokenized bonds.Central banks face a coordination game: Go slow and risk private standards hardening around them; go too fast and upend the funding model of commercial banks. The likeliest path is a phased approach:Stage 1: Limited-scope wholesale CBDC sandboxes plus tokenized collateral for central-bank counterparties.Stage 2: Dual-rail environments where RTGS balances and tokenized reserves interoperate via synchronization layers.Stage 3: Full adoption of smart-contract-based policy tools, possibly including real-time fiscal transfers.Just as earlier shifts like the rollout of RTGS systems or inflation-targeting regimes were introduced gradually to test and refine their impact, tokenized systems will be phased in through pilots, sandboxes and hybrid models before full-scale adoption.Whether it ultimately reshapes how central banks manage the economy remains to be seen.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-central-banks-are-testing-blockchain-based-monetary-policy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
