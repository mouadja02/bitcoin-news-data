Here Are the Details","Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas that artificial intelligence will bring about radical changes in company structures. Robinhood CEO: AI Will Transform Entrepreneurship, “One-Man Companies Like Satoshi” Are Coming According to Tenev, in the near future, “one-person companies” could become the norm thanks to artificial intelligence, just like Bitcoin’s mysterious inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto. Tenev likened this new AI-powered startup model to Nakamoto single-handedly creating Bitcoin. “We’re going to see more one-person companies. They’re going to be tokenized and traded on the blockchain, just like any other asset,” he said. “So it’s going to be possible to invest economically in a person or a project that that person is running.” “This is essentially like Bitcoin itself,” Tenev said, “Satoshi Nakamoto’s personal brand is powered by technology.” “Artificial intelligence will add more value with fewer resources” There have been suggestions for years that AI will simplify how companies operate. But Tenev focused on the opportunities it provides for entrepreneurs rather than its potential to replace the workforce. “One of the things that AI makes possible is that it produces more and more value with fewer and fewer resources,” he said. Bitcoin, which was founded with the technical document published by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, quickly produced a global digital economy. This adventure, which began with the mining of the first block in 2009, has today turned into a trillion-dollar crypto asset industry. Blockchain technology is now being used not only in financial transactions but also in many areas such as supply chain tracking, tokenization of digital artworks, and in-game assets. For example, Walmart is using blockchain to increase traceability in its supply chain. Robinhood is a trading platform where users can buy and sell stocks, commodities, and cryptocurrencies. The company has stepped up its crypto activities in recent years; its platform trades a variety of cryptocurrencies as well as memecoins. Tenev's statements strengthened expectations that artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies could combine to usher in a new era in entrepreneurship. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-28T07:55:13.000Z,"Week in GameFi: Bitcoin Hits All-Time High, But Web3 Gaming Misses the Momentum","Although Bitcoin grabbed the attention this week with a stunning surge past $112,000, there has been little fanfare for the GameFi sector. Despite an overall bullish sentiment now pulsating through the crypto markets, Web3 gaming assets have had a hard time keeping up. Trading volumes have tanked, and a couple of recent scandals have raised some eyebrows. All in all, the week was a pretty stark reminder of how up and down the GameFi world is right now. Bitcoin Breaks Records, GameFi Barely Reacts The broader cryptocurrency landscape could hardly have been more favorable. Waves of optimism washed around the digital asset space in the wake of Bitcoin’s all-time high close to $112K. Yet GameFi—a sector long associated with the speculative altcoin cycles—barely stirred in response to the recent Bitcoin rally. Ecosystem tokens across the Web3 gaming space saw only a modest 4 percent uptick, while worries mounted that trading volumes had plummeted by 22 percent—a sign, perhaps, that the lack of retail and institutional enthusiasm for gaming tokens might continue to hold the ecosystem back, even as capital floods into the broader market. Even the CMC Altcoin Index, a barometer of altcoin sector performance, crept up just a single point, moving from 27 to 28. The lack of movement illustrates a larger stagnation within the altcoin ecosystem, with GameFi especially struggling. DeFiLlama reports that GameFi has fallen in sector narrative rankings from 13th to 14th, which indicates that interest and influence in GameFi has continued to wane. Guild of Guardians Defies the Trend with Triple-Digit Gains Although most of the GameFi sector stayed gloomy, Guild of Guardians (GOG) pulled off an unbelievable feat. The token shot up a staggering 286 percent over the week, easily leaving its peers in the dust and obviously being the top performer in the gaming category. The surge has once more brought attention to GOG’s gameplay model and future roadmap, though one has to question whether it can keep delivering. A handful of other undertakings also eluded the prevailing pessimistic atmosphere: MASK: up to 40 percent OL: up 27 percent VIRTUALS: increased by 17 percent. Week in GameFi: Web3 Gaming Misses the BTC Boost BTC breaks $112K! But GameFi stays lukewarm! GOG soars 286%! Trading volumes plunge 22%! Let’s unpack what went down in the Web3 gaming world this week. pic.twitter.com/EhP4dHNO8m — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) May 26, 2025 Nevertheless, some were not so fortunate. Steering gains, NEXPACE, which led the previous week, reversed course and dropped 21 percent as traders rotated capital into newer opportunities. This signals and suggests for investors that GameFi is not as stable as it may seem. A lead kind of capital you can control like Grayscale won’t guarantee a rise in GameFi tokens. And that may indicate for investors that GameFi is not as stable a sector as one might have thought. These stark reversals and single-project supremacy showcase GameFi’s present vulnerability — where victories are dispersed, and overall industry sentiment is still lackluster. Scandals and Slow Rebuilds Undermine Confidence GameFi also received unwelcome press this week with the arrest of Vladimir Smerkis, co-founder of Blum, on charges stemming from large-scale financial fraud involving earlier ventures. Blum was quick to clarify that Smerkis does not work for them anymore, but the reputational hit is likely to stick. Whether potential investors or new users are thinking about the gaming aspect or the financial aspect of GameFi, news like this makes them question whether the whole thing is worth their time and money. In the meantime, platforms are busily restoring trust and engagement. WEMIX, a foremost GameFi project, took a significant step toward reactivating its user base and regaining momentum after a high-profile hack earlier this year by unveiling a new Mission System. In a different part of the Web3 world, BOXCAT announced not long ago that it would debut on Gate.io, giving an airdrop to holders of the exchange’s GT token—a modest but tokenomic effort to boost initial traction. These developments might not propel markets in overnight manners, but they do signal a rebuilding phase for GameFi. After the recent explosive growth and the speculative hype that accompanied it, many GameFi platforms seem to be returning to fundamentals. They are focusing on community engagement, platform security, and gradual ecosystem expansion. While Bitcoin’s command of the headlines and capital expressing itself in the GameFi domain, GameFi finds itself at a bit of a crossroads. The muted sector reaction to a record-breaking week in crypto amplifies the clarity of the situation: Challenges lie ahead, challenges that, if met successfully, lead to a destination called User Trust and Interest That is Not Just Hype. What the market wants to see now is proof that Web3 games can deliver actual lasting value. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

In a May 28 announcement , the company that it was raising $50 million through bonds. The bonds are issued in $1.25 million denominations and carry no interest. Investors will not receive regular payments, with any potential profit expected to come from the bond’s redemption value. Evo Fund, a Cayman Islands-based investment firm, will be the sole bondholder. The investment company has been Metaplanet’s primary backer for its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, subscribing to multiple rounds of Metaplanet’s zero-interest bonds, providing capital for its Bitcoin ( BTC ) buys. The bonds are unsecured and unguaranteed, having neither a bond administrator nor collateral. This reflects a high degree of trust between the two companies. It also shows confidence in BTC’s long-term outlook as Metaplanet continues to increase its holdings. Excerpt of Metaplanet’s announcement to issue zero-interest bonds to buy Bitcoin. Source: Metaplanet Metaplanet expects minimal impact on 2025 results Metaplanet said the issuance is expected to have minimal impact on its 2025 financial results. However, the company noted it would disclose further developments if needed. Metaplanet’s push into Bitcoin highlights a growing trend among companies seeking alternatives to fiat-based treasury strategies. The move follows Metaplanet’s second-biggest BTC purchase , scooping up 1,004 Bitcoin worth over $100 million. This pushed the company’s Bitcoin holdings to 7,800 BTC, worth over $800 million. According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET, Metaplanet is up by nearly 20% on its Bitcoin investments. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin strategy has also given its stock prices a boost . On May 27, 10x Research reported that Metaplanet’s stock trades as if Bitcoin were worth five times its actual price. The research company said investors in the company are “dramatically overpaying for their Bitcoin exposure.” Related: Bitcoin treasury pivot lifts luxury watchmaker’s stock more than 60% Bitcoin Treasury strategy attracts criticism With the rise of Bitcoin treasury companies’ stock prices, getting Bitcoin exposure through corporate wrappers has attracted criticism from well-known investor Jim Chanos. At the Sohn Investment Conference in New York, Chanos said he’s selling MicroStrategy stock to buy Bitcoin. Chanos’ move assumes investors are overpaying for BTC exposure through MicroStrategy and other firms that follow the same blueprint. The investor’s move assumes that purchasing Bitcoin directly would be better than purchasing stocks for indirect Bitcoin exposure. Magazine: Can Off the Grid survive Steam’s crypto ban?

2025-05-28T07:47:27.000Z,"Solana Leads in Capital Inflows Despite Declining Activity as Chain Competition Intensifies","May has been a month of mixed blessings for Solana . While the network saw a major inflow from centralized exchanges, to the tune of $1.1 billion—that’s the most since 2024; its on-chain transaction activity keep declining. Now, two key things here: 1. The inflow is a sign that investor interest is on the uptick, at least. 2. The fact that transaction activity on the chain is going down in spite of this inflow signals a divergence between investor interest and network utility that is rarely seen. BREAKING: @Solana saw an inflow of $1.1 billion from centralized exchanges in May alone, the largest monthly inflow since 2024. pic.twitter.com/Fh9eIZkBIx — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) May 27, 2025 And from where I’m sitting, that ain’t great. Solana Sees Historic Inflows Amid Transaction Decline In May, Solana drew in an astonishing $1.1 billion in capital from centralized exchanges, cementing its status as a go-to blockchain for institutions and retail investors. This figure represents the highest monthly inflow recorded since 2024 and occurs during a period when the entire crypto sector seems to be favoring high-throughput, low-fee chains. Even with this strong indication, Solana’s transaction volumes tell another tale. Per the data of OKX Explorer covering May 18 to 24, Solana carried out 2.37 billion transactions, down 8.24 percent week-over-week. This was the third week in a row of Solana having less “activity.” Even though this statement does not carry a good connotation, it does not make Solana’s numbers look bad at all. In fact, the number of raw transactions that Solana handles is vastly greater than those of competing chains. And even with these “bad” numbers, Solana is still a blockchain that you would want to be a part of. This divergence raises some big issues. Is it the case that users are becoming less active at the same time that capital is rushing into the ecosystem? We could be looking at something totally normal and healthy, with all this new money speculating on the ecosystem, in anticipation of upcoming applications or market catalysts—rather than something that’s representative of any sort of growth in everyday usage of Solana right now. On the flip side, if this new money is representative of actual new use cases for Solana, then where are all these new users of upcoming applications participating in Solana’s ongoing speculative economy? Competitors Catching Up as Solana’s Grip Weakens While Solana’s on-chain activity is decreasing, other blockchain networks are getting more active. The standout is clearly BNB Chain, which saw 53 million transactions last week—up 5.36 percent from the prior week. This was its third consecutive week of positive growth, with transaction activity rising 54 percent, then 2 percent, and now another 5 percent. BNB’s Chains steady climb should be interpreted as a rise in user engagement, which might be driven by DeFi applications, token launches, or the still-growing number of Binance-led initiatives. Polygon also had a strong showing, amassing 24.7 million transactions and vaulting 9.31 percent over the week. That comes on the heels of a three-week run totaling an 18 percent increase, putting Polygon atop the mid-tier performer ranking. Top 8 Chains by Weekly Total Txn OKX Explorer | May 18-24 Weekly Trends: @solana : 2.37B (-8.24% WoW) — Drop for 3 consecutive weeks; dominance erodes further. @fractal_bitcoin : 91.8M (-7.82% WoW ) — Volatility spikes after +2% rebound last week, but still holding a… pic.twitter.com/ACzNJYSYPb — OKX Explorer (@okxexplorer) May 27, 2025 Its low fees, along with its compatibility with Ethereum-based tools, keep developers and users piling into the ecosystem, with that flood largely dominated by the gaming and NFT sectors. At the same time, Base—the Ethereum Layer 2 created by Coinbase—had 59.3 million transactions but a 5.95 percent drop. This marked the halt of a five-week growth streak and may have signaled the beginning of a short-term correction. Base is still new, and this is a relatively calm period for it, which is tied closely to the destiny of Coinbase and what it decides to integrate and do in the future. Broader Ecosystem Faces Volatility and Fluctuation Other notable chains experienced similar conditions. Fractal Bitcoin, a volume-driven but not particularly “run-of-the-mill” platform, executed 91.8 million trades—a 7.82 percent drop after a minor rebound the prior week that hardly deserves mentioning. Even with that close-to-static status, Fractal Bitcoin retained its total-ahead-of-totals status versus Solana by remaining a stricter rule-following platform. Thus, among second-tier platforms, Fractal Bitcoin seems the most likely candidate for a kind of “pause that refreshed” scenario. Sui Network and Aptos, two younger Layer 1 blockchains, both continued to have some headwinds. Sui dropped another 2.87 percent in weekly transaction count, bringing its three-week decline to 9 percent. Aptos remained mostly flat at 26 million transactions, offering very little indication of renewed momentum after a brief stabilization phase. Tron also saw a setback hit it, with its 24.7 million weekly transactions coming in at an 8.05 percent drop. This netted out the week-before gains, and in the end, it highlighted the erratic nature of user activity on old, high-throughput chains. Even though transaction activity is down, inflows to Solana are at an all-time high. This must mean that there is still confidence in the Solana network, and confidence in it as a long-term vehicle for value. Solana is up against some stiff competition, though. The performance of not just Solana but all Layer 1 networks will be closely scrutinized in the coming weeks to see if they can maintain their upswell of interest and not just be faddish at the Layer 1 level while Layer 2 is winning the competitive race.

2025-05-28T07:43:33.000Z,"Bitcoin cements its haven asset reputation. Is the “means of exchange” narrative still alive?","Bitcoin has always been compared to gold. As time went by, the safe haven reputation of Bitcoin only strengthened. However, Bitcoin was conceived as an alternative cash system, and Bitcoin enthusiasts still greet businesses that have started accepting bitcoins. What are the chances that Bitcoin will eventually become a regular means of exchange? Safe haven assets: Bitcoin and gold Gold has been recognized as a safe haven for a long time, meaning that it successfully preserves value in times of financial turbulence, serving as a strong hedge against inflation. Bitcoin, sometimes referred to as digital gold, is something new in this regard. Multiple investors and financial experts went so far as to call Bitcoin a better version of gold. Both assets are scarce and hard to produce. Gold is finite, and Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million, most of which is already in circulation and around three million are lost forever. As for the advantages of Bitcoin over gold, cryptocurrency is extremely easy to manage. Gold bars need special storage. Maintenance of gold bars is demanding and costly. More than that, gold needs space. Bitcoin is much more comfortable as you may always have it with you as long as you obtain a seed phrase of your wallet or private and public keys. Bitcoin can be stored in a trustless manner. For gold, you will probably have to trust professionals. Sending gold is way harder and more expensive than sending a Bitcoin transaction. Another characteristic that makes Bitcoin way different from gold is value dynamics. Bitcoin has an element of gambling to it, as its price is pretty volatile. However, as institutional investors and governments are joining the hunt for Bitcoin, the price stabilizes without losing its upward direction. Many say that this cycle will be different from the previous ones, meaning that major ups and downs of Bitcoin will probably become a thing of the past. Read more: 2025 is no longer about cycles — Bitcoin is reading something else entirely Gold has a long-term price appreciation, too, and does not have the volatility of Bitcoin. More than that, during the economic turmoil triggered by Donald Trump’s tariff policies, gold spiked immensely, not Bitcoin. It signals that investors trust gold more than Bitcoin. Gold slipped after Trump softened EU tariff threats — a reminder that its haven status now bends to politics. Meanwhile, $BTC held steady amid rising deficits, rating downgrades, and macro chaos (even touching new ATH's along the way) Is Bitcoin the new flight to safety? — Bitcoin.com News (@BTCTN) May 26, 2025 One of the reasons behind gold’s strength is that its price doesn’t correlate with the stock market movements but rather grows slowly and intensifies when people expect hard times. Bitcoin is tied to stock prices more clearly. Finally, gold is familiar to most people and leans to more established regulations. Uncertainty in Bitcoin regulation is turning some of the potential investors away. Bitcoin as a means of exchange While some insist that Bitcoin is not good for payments but great as a savings currency, many in the crypto community argue that Bitcoin derives its value from being used as a means of exchange. In 2021, Tesla made a revolutionary step when it announced that its vehicles could be purchased for Bitcoin. However, soon after, the company withdrew its decision, citing the environmental impact of Bitcoin as the reason. In the U.S., many big and small businesses accept Bitcoin. Notable examples are Apple, Microsoft, Starbucks, PayPal, Netflix, and many others. The idea that you should not spend Bitcoin and only spend fiat is a fallacy made by state spooks to stop bitcoiners from using it as MoE. You can simply buy Bitcoin with your fiat and spend that Bitcoin when you need it. It does not matter for your wealth whether you spend fiat… — Sina 🗝️⚡ 21st Capital (@Sina_21st) May 22, 2025 However, despite various advantages, Bitcoin’s use as a means of exchange is limited by a relatively small share of merchants accepting BTC. According to Bitdegree, Bitcoin is accepted by 15,000 businesses around the world, of which over 2,000 are based in the U.S. On top of that, the network capacity of Bitcoin is too small for a means of exchange used by the masses. It can process only up to seven transactions per second. For comparison, Visa is capable of processing over 65,000 transactions per second. It is accepted in over 46 million merchant locations. Nevertheless, the Bitcoin community was never going to get over it. For years, developers have been working on solutions to scale Bitcoin up for higher adoption as a means of exchange. The most well-known project aimed at solving Bitcoin’s scalability issues is Lightning Network. LN is a layer-2 protocol that enables fast and cheap transactions using off-chain transactions for this purpose. Surprisingly, even the name of the smallest denomination of Bitcoin became the battleground within the crypto community. Originally, the one hundred-millionth particle of Bitcoin was called Satoshi (or sats), after Satoshi Nakamoto, a mysterious creator of Bitcoin. A new proposal suggests that the name “bits” will fit better. Prepaid crypto debit cards are moving Bitcoin spending forward. They allow clients to hold BTC right on the banking card and spend it anywhere where the cards are accepted. Bitcoins are turned into fiat money automatically and exchanged. As prepaid cryptocurrency cards continue to occur and more businesses jump on the Bitcoin train, BTC will become an easier choice as a means of exchange. However, its role as capital or savings money will persist.

The victim claimed his captors forced him to reveal his Bitcoin account password. According to a recent report by AP News, 32-year-old William Duplessie has surrendered to the police over the alleged kidnapping of a man who claimed he was tortured for weeks in a posh New York townhouse by crypto investors seeking to extort his Bitcoin ( BTC ) funds. Duplessie is the second alleged culprit to be apprehended by the police. He faces charges of kidnapping, assault, unlawful imprisonment and criminal possession of a weapon. His accomplice, fellow crypto investor John Woeltz, was taken into custody four days earlier after the victim managed to escape their grasp. Duplessie is known online as the co-founder and head of sourcing at Pangea Blockchain Fund and an avid investor in blockchain firms. While Woeltz has described himself as a blockchain investor who spent time in Silicon Valley before becoming involved in the crypto mining sector in Kentucky. On May 23, a 28-year-old Italian man found by a traffic agent at the side of the road. Bloodied and barefoot, the victim claimed to have been beaten, drugged, shocked with electricity and threatened with death for nearly three weeks in an eight-bedroom townhouse located in Soho, Manhattan. According to the police, the victim was lured to the townhouse by Duplessie and Woeltz on May 6. The two crypto investors allegedly attempted to extort the man to give up his Bitcoin account password.

Believing he would be killed soon if he did not comply to their demands, the victim agreed on Friday morning to reveal his Bitcoin account password to the captors. When the two men went to get the victim’s computer, the victim managed to escape from the home. He is currently hospitalized for his injuries that appeared consistent with the evidence authorities found in the Manhattan townhouse.

2025-05-28T07:39:03.000Z,"Bitcoin Whale Count Climbs as Price Hits New All-Time High, Miner Selling Accelerates","Bitcoin is showing once again why it’s the most impressive financial instrument of our times. Ever since it surpassed $64,000 for the first time in mid-April, it has continued climbing, recently hitting price levels around $68,000. And it’s not just the price itself that is impressive, but rather the number of influential participants in the ecosystem and how they’ve been behaving along with the price. Ostensibly, the price seems to be signaling powerfully in one direction: up. But you can never understand market dynamics purely through price. In this case, you do have to look under the hood. And what you’re finding underneath the Bitcoin hood tends to reinforce belief that this price uptick is undergirded as much by power dynamics in the ecosystem as it is by just plain old price action. Bitcoin Whales on the Rise Amid New Price Milestone Bitcoin whales, often seen as key market movers because of their large holdings, now number 1,455 entities, up from a contraction in late April. This renewed growth among the largest of Bitcoin holders reflects either a new accumulation phase or consolidation among holders of the original cryptocurrency. At the very least, a higher count of Bitcoin whales signals a ramped-up interest in the storied asset among some very wealthy or institutional players. After dipping in late April, the number of #Bitcoin whales (≥1k $BTC ) has resumed its climb – reaching 1,455 entities even as the price hit a new ATH: https://t.co/O9oN7mZlLk pic.twitter.com/2zebaS6vik — glassnode (@glassnode) May 27, 2025 In the Bitcoin ecosystem, whales have a really big role. Their buy and sell decisions result in a liquidity influx or just as much in a liquidity drain, and are therefore pretty much the most direct influence on the market. The number of Bitcoin whales has been on the rise. This could signal that confidence remains strong among the biggest holders. Nonetheless, it’s critical to point out that a rise in the number of whale holders doesn’t equate to all whales stacking more Bitcoin. Reflecting developments in the whale segment, we could be seeing two things: 1. A count increase in actual whale wallets, which signals a favorable trend for the distribution of Bitcoin among major holders. 2. An increase in the number of wallets with at least 1,000 BTC, which could mean that some of the new wallets are simply picking up chunks of Bitcoin. Miners Respond to ATH with Increased Selling Activity Ever since the price of Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high, there has been a noticeable uptick in the number of miners selling their newly minted coins on exchanges. Recent data shows that daily inflows of Bitcoin from miners to exchanges have doubled—from an average of 25 BTC per day to around 50 BTC per day. This is an impressive, if not quite astonishing, acceleration, and it is one that has surely caught the eye of quite a few market observers as of late. After the ATH, miners have stepped up their sales on exchanges. Inflows have doubled from an average of 25BTC to 50BTC per day, while historical peaks reach around 100BTC. This shows that selling has indeed accelerated though we’re still a long way from peak volumes and the… pic.twitter.com/fTsGLyKovc — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) May 27, 2025 This increase in miner selling is a direct response to the market. Sometimes miners just sell to cover the basic operational costs that you would expect from any business—stuff like electricity and maintaining the actual hardware. But when the price of Bitcoin doubles, and you’re the one producing it, it becomes quite reasonable to take some profits on the way up. Even with the rising sales, the market has seemed capable of taking in this extra supply. This points to a very liquid market and a demand from buyers that seems ongoing and ready to absorb miner selling without causing much in the way of price disruption. There is a balance right now between how much miners are supplying and how much the market is able to take in. And that balance is crucial if we want to avoid having the price skyrocket in a bull run or crash under selling pressure when the network is collapsing for some reason. Miner Revenue Signals Strong Network Activity, But Room to Grow The generation of revenue for miners offers another glimpse into the health of the Bitcoin network and the dynamics of its market. At present, miners are bringing in about $50 million daily in Bitcoin rewards and, yes, fees. That number is a big one, a sign that mining is going on at a scale at which sufficient security is being delivered to the network. At present, miners are earning around $50M per day, while historical revenue peaks exceed $80M. This indicates a high but not yet peak level of network activity: miners are already generating significant income, yet there’s still room to climb back to those previous highs. pic.twitter.com/OKFof2GalA — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) May 27, 2025 Miners have surpassed historical revenue highs of $80 million per day, suggesting that not only are we at a high point now, but there’s still room to grow before hitting the levels of past peaks. It makes you wonder just how far network activity and overall profitability can go. And is there more incentive for miners to hop on board or for the price of the assets themselves to appreciate? This interplay between miner earnings and market conditions often acts as a bellwether for Bitcoin’s broader ecosystem. Higher miner revenue can incentivize increased mining capacity and network security, but it also leads to higher sell pressure as miners convert rewards into fiat or other assets. The recent trends surrounding Bitcoin whales and miner selling provide us with a somewhat complicated view of the current Bitcoin market. Selling by miners has increased because they’re now taking advantage of the higher prices. They’re clearly not holding onto their Bitcoin in any significant amounts anymore, and they don’t seem to be too worried about the upcoming halving. Whales, on the other hand, seem confident in the future of Bitcoin. They’re not selling, and in fact, some of them might even be buying. The market seems capable of absorbing significant amounts of Bitcoin without too much fuss. The current evolution of Bitcoin provides a fascinating glimpse into its dynamic future. Watching the balance between whale accumulation, miner liquidation, and demand from the wider world will be vital to understanding just what the price action and overall network health will be across the next months. In these parts, it’s generally understood that our ecosystem is vibrant. Whale numbers are up, miner revenues (while solid) aren’t through the roof, and that means we’ve still got the appearance of a maturing, healthy Bitcoin.

2025-05-28T07:36:35.000Z,"SharpLink Gaming Bets Big on Ethereum: $425M Raise Sparks Market Buzz","In a surprise move for the crypto world, SharpLink Gaming, which is listed on the Nasdaq, has pronounced an astounding initiative to amass a substantial $425 million worth of funding, all meant to buy Ethereum ($ETH). The crypto community has taken notice, and for good reason: the very day SharpLink made its announcement, its stock shot up—up, up, and away—by an utterly insane 262%. Even with recent sharp increases in value, analysts are still recommending caution when it comes to Ethereum. A huge chunk of its market cap (around $123 billion) is positioned only 0–20% above the necessary breakeven point to convert the current holders into actual profit. That’s not a lot of room for the asset to play around with under the cover of seeming healthy market sentiment. In a declining price scenario, that covers at least 10% of the holders who would be pushed into a loss—they’re not gonna like that, and it seems at this point quite likely that at least 10% of the holders are gonna cover. Covering can be done in a variety of ways. COMPANIES ARE NOW PLANNING TO BUY $ETH Just now, Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming announced a $𝟒𝟐𝟓,𝟎𝟎𝟎,𝟎𝟎𝟎 raise to buy Ethereum. SharpLink Gaming's stock price is up 𝟐𝟔𝟐% after this news I hope it becomes a success like MicroStrategy and sends ETH above… pic.twitter.com/9ryalm0Vum — Wise Advice (@wiseadvicesumit) May 27, 2025 Institutional Momentum Building for Ethereum? SharpLink has decided to buy Bitcoin, and its decision echoes that of MicroStrategy. The high-profile business of MicroStrategy made headlines in 2020 and beyond with its bold Bitcoin acquisition strategy. That campaign helped push BTC into a more mainstream financial conversation and played a key role in the asset being valued at all-time highs. Is Ethereum the next target? SharpLink’s initiative may be one of the largest public raises specifically aimed at purchasing ETH, and it could well set a precedent for more corporate treasuries to diversify into Ethereum as a long-term investment. In an environment where crypto is increasingly viewed as an inflation hedge and as a bulwark against the continued debasement of fiat currencies, the growing appeal of ETH is further enhanced by its burgeoning use case—from decentralized finance to NFTs to smart contracts. Should other publicly traded firms choose to emulate SharpLink—and there are already hints that some may—this could yield pressure on Ethereum’s price that lasts. Analysts and enthusiasts even wonder aloud whether, in this next market cycle, ETH might punch through resistance that is more psychological than real on its way to $10,000. ETH Price Gains vs. Market Fragility Even though there is now a lot of interest from institutions, Ethereum’s current standing is still weak. A recent look at the data puts most of ETH’s market cap in wallets that are just barely in the money. These wallets hold coins that are only 0-20% above acquisition prices. So, if the price were to correct even slightly—say, back toward the $2,300 price point—there would be a large number of holders who’d suddenly find themselves in the position of holding ETH with an acquisition price that’s above the current market price. The largest share of #ETH market cap – $123B – sits just 0–20% above cost basis. That cohort swelled from $2.3K to $2.5K, meaning even a modest price drop could flip a large chunk of supply into loss. Despite recent gains, $ETH remains in a fragile position. pic.twitter.com/5Ay5Jx5Qv5 — glassnode (@glassnode) May 27, 2025 The fragility poses risks, especially when sentiment is this bullish. SharpLink’s announcement has undoubtedly injected momentum into the ETH narrative but could also set unrealistic expectations. If Ethereum fails to deliver on short-term price gains, the fragility could lead to amplified disappointment among retail investors and institutions. Even so, Ethereum has taken a beating, just like many other cryptocurrencies, yet it has reasserted itself as a foundational layer for the .”decentralized web”—or what some might call the future of the internet. This is because Ethereum has scaled, allowing far more transactions to occur on its network than before, and it has upgraded from the “proof-of-work” format to the vastly more energy-efficient “proof-of-stake” format. And these changes have occurred within a broader upgrade to the rules of the Ethereum network itself. Looking Ahead: A New Chapter for Ethereum? SharpLink Gaming’s $425 million influx is a lot more than a finance play. It signals an even bolder confidence in the future of Ethereum. Whether public companies make this a trend will be shown in time, but the implications for Ethereum as a public company are significant in several ways. If nothing else, in an era where public companies are cutting back and putting their own cash on their balance sheets, this is the clearest sign yet that Ethereum retains a compelling use case. Yet, investors and watchers of this space must proceed with great caution. An asset class can shift in fundamental quality in the blink of an eye, and dramatic price moves are not uncommon. If you’re bullish on crypto, you might take this morning’s announcement from SharpLink as more bullish news in an overall cautious market, one with a lot of uncertain player and price dynamics.

Robert Mitchnick, Managing Director at BlackRock, said that Bitcoin offers “much higher upside than gold and lower downside,” strengthening the idea that Bitcoin is maturing as a mainstream investment asset. Bitcoin vs. Gold: Not a Zero-Sum Game Mitchnick made it clear that comparing Bitcoin and gold doesn’t have to be a competition. Instead, he sees both as strong assets that serve a similar purpose, helping investors hedge against traditional financial risks. Meanwhile, he described them as “different angles on a similar theme,” highlighting that both are scarce, decentralized, and not controlled by governments. JUST IN: $11.5 trillion BlackRock Managing Director said \""Bitcoin has much higher upside than gold\"" pic.twitter.com/YTA5tFJxzX — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) May 27, 2025 While gold has been trusted for centuries and is less volatile, Bitcoin stands out as a digital-native asset fit for today’s fast-paced world. It’s cheaper to store, easy to transfer globally, and works efficiently within a tech-driven financial ecosystem. Digital Advantages Give Bitcoin the Edge Mitchnick noted Bitcoin’s modern advantages. Unlike gold, Bitcoin can be moved instantly across the world with nearly zero cost. These features make it highly attractive to both retail and institutional investors looking for quick and flexible alternatives to traditional safe-haven assets. That’s why he believes Bitcoin has greater upside potential and, surprisingly, less downside risk than many think. “Many investors are adding both to their portfolios,” he said, pointing out that allocation shifts like 80% gold and 20% Bitcoin or even 50-50 are becoming more common. Bitcoin Price Outlook Looking at the bitcoin price, it has dropped by almost 3% after reaching a new record high. Right now, Bitcoin is trading at about $109,000, and its total market value is at $2.16 trillion. There’s some interesting data from CoinGlass . It shows that a short squeeze could be coming. If Bitcoin goes above $115,000, more than $7 billion in short trades might be closed.

Major players are positioning early with Bitcoin trading just below its all-time high. However, smart money isn’t only focused on BTC. It’s rotating into assets that combine upside potential with real-world application. Two strong contenders gaining momentum are Worldcoin and Remittix , both offering fresh value compared to legacy options like XRP. Bitcoin price holds firm near record highs Source: Coinmarketcap The Bitcoin price is currently around $109,317 , which is within reach of its all-time high of $111,970.17. Traders are watching the $112,000 level for a confirmed breakout. With macro conditions improving and ETF activity rebounding, momentum could push BTC into new territory. Some analysts now expect a short-term climb toward $117,000 or even $120,000. Institutional flows continue to build. BTC is still seen as a digital reserve by hedge funds and high-net-worth portfolios. But many of those same players are now diversifying into faster-moving projects with room to run. XRP remains steady but eyes are shifting Source: Financemagnets XRP is holding support around $2.31. It’s stable, and sentiment is improving as the market anticipates further regulatory clarity. Some models project that XRP could reach $8 in 2025 . That would be a solid return, but some investors are now looking for assets with different use cases or more immediate upside. This shift is where rising projects come in, especially ones with traction in areas XRP hasn’t fully captured, like identity and fiat conversion. Worldcoin pushes higher with growing use case Worldcoin has gained significant attention over the last few weeks. The token is trading at $1.35, and some forecasts suggest a push toward $2.40 if volume continues to rise. But the appeal here is not just about price. The WLD ecosystem is built around solving one of crypto’s biggest gaps: identity. By offering a global digital identity layer, WLD aims to onboard users in underserved regions who need access to finance, not just speculation. With $135 million in recent funding and growing adoption across markets, WLD is emerging as more than just an altcoin and it’s a project with a real mission. This direction makes it a true rival to XRP, but with a newer and broader scope. Remittix keeps it simple and functional While bigger names dominate the news, Remittix is gaining quiet traction by focusing on real-world utility. It allows users to convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat and send them directly to global bank accounts. There are no middle steps, wallet confusion or hidden FX charges. For businesses, Remittix offers a plug-and-play API to accept crypto and settle in fiat, across 30 fiat currencies and 50 crypto pairs. The simplicity of the process is what’s getting early investor interest. With $15.3 million raised and the token still in presale, RTX could find a strong foothold in the cross-border payments space. Final thoughts The Bitcoin price is moving with confidence, and that’s pulling capital back into the market. While BTC and XRP remain strong, the conversation is expanding. Investors are betting on projects that solve new problems, not just scale old ones. WLD is redefining digital identity. Remittix is streamlining how crypto becomes usable money. Both are becoming serious contenders for those seeking strong XRP alternatives in this next cycle.

This decision sees the firm add Bitcoin to its corporate treasury, a trend gaining traction among forward-thinking companies seeking alternative store-of-value assets and growth opportunities in the digital economy. Why Are Companies Adding Bitcoin to Their Corporate Treasury? The decision by companies like Captor Capital to incorporate Bitcoin into their treasury reserves isn’t merely speculative; it’s often a calculated strategic play. Traditionally, corporate treasuries hold cash and short-term, low-yield investments to manage liquidity and preserve capital. However, in the current economic climate characterized by inflation concerns and low interest rates, the purchasing power of fiat currency can erode over time. Adding Bitcoin to the corporate treasury offers several potential advantages: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply (capped at 21 million coins) is often cited as a defense against inflation, unlike fiat currencies which can be printed indefinitely. Store of Value: Proponents view Bitcoin as digital gold, a scarce asset that can retain value over the long term. Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term growth potential compared to traditional assets. Diversification: Bitcoin offers diversification away from traditional financial markets and assets. Signal to Market: Holding Bitcoin can signal innovation and adaptability to investors and the market. While pioneering companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla made headlines with large Bitcoin acquisitions, the move by Captor Capital demonstrates that this strategy is being adopted by a broader range of firms, including those in diverse sectors like investment and potentially cannabis (given Captor Capital’s known interests). Captor Capital’s Specific Crypto Investment: What Happened? According to a press release distributed via GlobeNewswire, Captor Capital announced it had acquired $500,000 worth of Bitcoin (BTC) for its treasury. This specific crypto investment represents a deliberate decision to allocate a portion of the company’s capital into the leading digital asset. Accompanying this acquisition, the firm also disclosed the issuance of $450,000 in unsecured convertible loan notes. These notes were issued to a European institutional investor. Convertible notes are a type of debt that can be converted into equity (shares) under certain conditions. Using such instruments can provide capital for acquisitions or operations while offering the investor potential upside linked to the company’s future performance, or in this context, potentially linked to future equity or other arrangements. This structure suggests a carefully planned financial manoeuvre, linking the strategic asset acquisition (Bitcoin) with a specific funding mechanism involving an institutional player. Understanding Institutional Adoption in Crypto The involvement of a European institutional investor in financing Captor Capital’s move is just as significant as the Bitcoin purchase itself. Institutional adoption refers to the increasing participation of large financial institutions, corporations, and investment funds in the cryptocurrency market. Their involvement is crucial because: It brings substantial capital into the market. It lends credibility and legitimacy to the asset class. It often leads to the development of regulated products and infrastructure (like futures, options, and custody solutions) that make crypto more accessible and palatable for other large players. Captor Capital, as an investment firm itself, making a direct treasury allocation and simultaneously engaging with an institutional investor for financing, exemplifies this trend. It shows growing confidence not just in Bitcoin as an asset, but also in the evolving financial structures around it that facilitate larger transactions and corporate involvement. Benefits and Challenges of a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy While the potential benefits discussed earlier are attractive, holding Bitcoin in a corporate treasury is not without its challenges. Potential Benefits: Potential appreciation significantly boosting treasury value. Protection against long-term fiat devaluation. Enhanced appeal to investors interested in digital assets. Setting a precedent or leadership position in their sector regarding digital asset integration. Potential Challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically, potentially leading to significant paper losses in the treasury value. Accounting Treatment: Accounting rules for digital assets can be complex and vary by jurisdiction (often treated as intangible assets subject to impairment). Security Risks: Securely storing private keys requires robust security protocols to prevent theft or loss. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving and varies globally. Public Perception: Some stakeholders might view Bitcoin investment as risky or outside the company’s core business. Companies undertaking this strategy must carefully weigh these factors and implement strong risk management protocols. Actionable Insights from Captor Capital’s Move For investors and businesses watching the space, Captor Capital’s action provides several insights: Institutional Interest is Real: The involvement of a European institutional investor in the financing underscores that large financial players are actively participating, not just watching. Treasury Strategy is Evolving: Companies are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a legitimate component for long-term treasury management, not just a speculative trading asset. Size Matters, But Trend is Key: While $500,000 might seem modest compared to billion-dollar corporate holdings, it signals intent and a shift in capital allocation strategy for a firm like Captor Capital. It adds to the growing number of companies engaging with the asset class. Financing Mechanisms are Developing: The use of convertible notes shows how traditional financial instruments are being adapted to facilitate crypto-related corporate activities. Monitoring such moves across different sectors and geographies provides valuable insight into the pace and nature of broader institutional adoption . Conclusion: A Step Towards Mainstream Acceptance Captor Capital’s decision to add Bitcoin to treasury reserves, supported by institutional financing, is more than just a news item; it’s another brick in the wall of institutional adoption for cryptocurrencies. While challenges remain, the increasing willingness of publicly traded companies and investment firms to hold Bitcoin as a strategic asset for their corporate treasury signifies a maturing market and growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. This crypto investment move by a Canadian firm, backed by European capital, illustrates the global nature of this evolving financial trend.

2025-05-28T07:20:49.000Z,"Bitcoin Rally Surges 47%, Yet Long-Term Holders Show Unwavering Conviction","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Rally Surges 47%, Yet Long-Term Holders Show Unwavering Conviction The cryptocurrency world is buzzing! Bitcoin (BTC) has once again captured headlines, staging an impressive rally that saw its price climb more than 47% from recent lows, even hitting brand new record highs. This kind of price action usually brings out the sellers, especially those who bought Bitcoin a long time ago and are sitting on massive profits. But here’s the surprising twist: the most dedicated participants – the long-term holders – appear to be showing remarkable restraint. Understanding the Bitcoin Rally and Long-Term Holder Behavior When we talk about a Bitcoin rally of this magnitude, it’s natural to assume significant profit-taking is occurring. After all, many individuals and institutions who held Bitcoin through previous cycles are now seeing their investments reach unprecedented values. However, analyzing the behavior of these experienced market participants requires looking beyond just the price chart. This is where on-chain metrics become invaluable tools for understanding the underlying market dynamics. Jamie Coutts, Chief Crypto Analyst at Real Vision, highlighted this exact phenomenon. He noted that while certain high-level metrics might suggest the potential for profit-taking, others reveal whether that potential is actually being realized by those with the deepest conviction. On-Chain Metrics: Potential vs. Realization To get a clearer picture of what’s happening under the hood of the Bitcoin price movement, analysts use various on-chain indicators. Two commonly cited metrics are the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio and the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL). These metrics essentially compare the current market price to the average purchase price of all Bitcoins on the network, giving an idea of the overall profitability of the market. MVRV Ratio: This compares Bitcoin’s market cap to its realized cap (which values each Bitcoin at the price it last moved). A high MVRV suggests the market is overheated and many holders are in profit, potentially signaling a top. NUPL: This metric shows the aggregate profit or loss of all Bitcoin positions. A high NUPL indicates a large percentage of the market is in unrealized profit. Both MVRV and NUPL have indeed reflected the significant potential for profit-taking during this recent Bitcoin rally . With the price soaring, a vast number of coins are now held at a substantial unrealized gain. However, these metrics tell us about potential profit, not realized profit. The Key Metric: LTH-SOPR Reveals Long-Term Holder Actions To understand if long-term holders are actually selling and taking those profits, analysts turn to metrics like the Long-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (LTH-SOPR). This metric specifically looks at the average profit/loss of coins that have moved on-chain and were held for a significant period (usually defined as longer than 155 days). An LTH-SOPR value above 1 indicates that long-term holders are selling coins at a profit, while a value below 1 suggests they are selling at a loss (a rare event in a strong bull market). The higher the LTH-SOPR value, the larger the average profit being taken by these holders when they decide to spend their coins. Jamie Coutts pointed to the LTH-SOPR as the crucial indicator revealing the true behavior of long-term holders during this rally. He provided historical context for LTH-SOPR values at previous market peaks: 2017 Peak: LTH-SOPR reached approximately 17. This signifies massive profits being realized by long-term holders exiting positions. 2021 Peak: LTH-SOPR peaked around 8. Still very high, indicating significant profit-taking, but less extreme than 2017. Q1 2024 Peak (at the time of hitting new highs): LTH-SOPR reached about 4.3. This was the highest it had been in the current cycle, indicating some distribution, but notably lower than previous cycle tops. Now, despite the Bitcoin price hitting new records and the rally continuing, the LTH-SOPR sits at just 2.1. This is significantly lower than the values seen at the peak of the 2017 and 2021 bull runs, and even below the recent Q1 2024 high. This data strongly suggests that, while there’s immense potential for profit-taking, long-term holders have yet to engage in widespread selling. Why Are Long-Term Holders Holding Firm? This observation raises a fascinating question: why aren’t these experienced holders capitalizing more aggressively on the current Bitcoin rally ? Several factors could be at play: Belief in Higher Prices: Many long-term holders have weathered multiple market cycles and may genuinely believe that Bitcoin’s price is headed significantly higher in this cycle, perhaps targeting values far exceeding current levels. Anticipation of Further Demand: The approval and success of spot Bitcoin ETFs in major markets have opened new avenues for institutional and retail investment. Holders may be anticipating continued inflows that will push the price up further. HODLing Culture: The strong ‘HODL’ (Hold On for Dear Life) ethos within the Bitcoin community is a powerful psychological factor. For many, Bitcoin is not just a short-term trade but a long-term store of value or even a form of digital property they intend to hold for years, if not decades. Tax Implications: Selling assets held for over a year often qualifies for more favorable long-term capital gains tax rates. However, realizing massive profits still incurs a tax liability, which might deter some holders from selling until absolutely necessary or until they perceive a cycle top is imminent. Comparison to Previous Cycles: As the LTH-SOPR data shows, previous tops saw much higher profit realization levels. Holders might be waiting for the market exuberance and on-chain metrics to reach levels more comparable to past peaks before considering significant distribution. Implications for Crypto Market Analysis What does this behavior of long-term holders mean for the broader crypto market analysis ? The fact that this cohort, often considered the ‘smart money’ or the most convicted holders, is not selling aggressively during a major price surge suggests a few things: Strong Underlying Conviction: It indicates a high level of confidence among experienced investors regarding Bitcoin’s future prospects. Potential for Further Upside: If the most patient sellers aren’t selling yet, it implies that the selling pressure primarily comes from shorter-term traders or newer market entrants. The absence of significant long-term holder distribution could mean there’s still room for the rally to continue before a major top is formed. Market Structure Difference: This cycle might be fundamentally different due to factors like institutional adoption via ETFs, potentially changing the typical patterns of supply and demand compared to previous cycles. However, it’s crucial to remember that market dynamics can change rapidly. While current on-chain metrics suggest limited long-term holder selling, this could shift if the Bitcoin price sees a sharp correction or if external factors create uncertainty. Monitoring LTH-SOPR and other on-chain data will be key to identifying potential changes in this behavior. Challenges and What to Watch For While the current LTH-SOPR reading is bullish from a supply perspective, challenges remain. The potential for profit-taking still exists, and a sudden market shock or a perceived cycle peak could trigger selling from even the most steadfast holders. Key things to watch include: A significant and rapid increase in LTH-SOPR towards levels seen in previous cycles (8, 17, or even higher). Increased inflows of Bitcoin to exchanges, particularly from wallets identified as long-term holders. Changes in other on-chain metrics that signal distribution or weakening demand. Actionable Insights from On-Chain Metrics For those navigating the current market, the insights from on-chain metrics and the behavior of long-term holders offer valuable perspective: Don’t just look at the price: Understand the underlying supply and demand dynamics by exploring on-chain data. Pay attention to LTH-SOPR: This specific metric provides a window into the actions of the most experienced market participants. Consider the long-term view: The conviction of long-term holders suggests that many see significant future value in Bitcoin, reinforcing the idea of a multi-year investment horizon rather than short-term trading. Stay informed: Keep track of key on-chain indicators and expert analysis to understand shifts in market sentiment and holder behavior. Conclusion: Unwavering Conviction Amidst the Rally Bitcoin’s remarkable 47%+ Bitcoin rally has pushed its price to new heights, creating immense unrealized profits for many holders. Yet, as revealed by crucial on-chain metrics like LTH-SOPR, the most patient and experienced investors – the long-term holders – are largely holding firm. Their current profit-taking levels are significantly lower than those observed at the peak of previous bull markets, suggesting a strong, unwavering conviction in Bitcoin’s future potential. This behavior provides valuable insight for anyone performing crypto market analysis , potentially signaling that this market cycle still has unique dynamics at play and that significant supply from the most steadfast hands has yet to hit the market.

While the landscape for Dogecoin appears promising, concerns surround Shiba Inu and its next move. At first, Ali Martinez noted that the TD Sequential metric, which is used to determine the underlying asset’s trend exhaustion in either direction, has flashed a buy signal for DOGE on the hourly chart. Previous examples show that the OG meme coin is particularly susceptible to this metric. Recall that it pointed to another buy signal in late February when its price had tumbled below $0.195.

It has lost 13% of value since then and trades at just over $0.222 now, but the TD Sequential could hint at more upcoming gains. SHIB’s monthly chart is quite similar to that of its bigger competitor, as it shot up to over $0.000016 in mid-May but has fallen by around 12-13% since then. Martinez noted its recent behavior, which has been consolidating in a descending triangle, potentially leading to a significant 17% move.

2025-05-28T07:10:44.000Z,"Metaplanet Bitcoin: Japan’s Bold $50M Bond Move Fuels Massive BTC Purchase","BitcoinWorld Metaplanet Bitcoin: Japan’s Bold $50M Bond Move Fuels Massive BTC Purchase Hey crypto enthusiasts and finance watchers! Big news is coming out of Japan that’s set to make waves in the world of corporate treasury management and, of course, Bitcoin. Metaplanet, a Japanese company already known for its significant Bitcoin holdings, has just announced a strategic move that underscores its strong conviction in the digital asset. This development puts the spotlight squarely back on Metaplanet Bitcoin strategy and the growing trend of Corporate Bitcoin adoption globally, particularly in the Japanese market. What Exactly Did Metaplanet Announce Regarding Metaplanet Bitcoin? Metaplanet shared via their official communication channels that they plan to issue 6.4 billion Japanese Yen (JPY) worth of 0% Ordinary Bonds. At current exchange rates, this amounts to approximately $50 million USD. The stated purpose of issuing these bonds is crystal clear: to acquire additional Bitcoin (BTC). This isn’t Metaplanet’s first foray into using debt to fund Bitcoin investment . They have previously utilized similar financial instruments to increase their BTC stack. This repeated strategy signals a deliberate and consistent approach to leveraging their balance sheet to gain more exposure to the leading cryptocurrency. Issuing 0% bonds is particularly interesting in the current economic climate. It means Metaplanet is essentially borrowing money without incurring interest costs for the duration of the bond term. This low-cost financing method allows them to acquire an appreciating asset like Bitcoin without the drag of interest payments, assuming the Bitcoin price performs favorably over time. It’s a financial maneuver aimed at optimizing their capital structure for their specific Bitcoin investment goals. Why Are Companies Pursuing Corporate Bitcoin Adoption? The decision by a publicly listed company like Metaplanet to issue debt specifically for a BTC purchase highlights a broader shift in corporate finance thinking. Why are more companies considering or actively engaging in Corporate Bitcoin adoption ? Several factors drive this trend: Inflation Hedge: In an era of potential currency debasement and rising inflation concerns, companies are looking for assets that can potentially preserve or increase purchasing power over the long term. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply and decentralized nature, is viewed by some as a digital store of value, analogous to digital gold. Store of Value: Beyond inflation, companies hold significant cash reserves. Keeping large amounts of cash can lead to value erosion, especially in low-interest-rate environments or periods of economic uncertainty. Allocating a portion to Bitcoin is seen as a way to hold a non-sovereign, censorship-resistant asset. Balance Sheet Optimization: For companies like Metaplanet, using low-cost debt (like 0% bonds) to acquire Bitcoin is a way to potentially enhance shareholder value. If the return on the Bitcoin investment exceeds the cost of borrowing (in this case, zero), it can be accretive to the company’s financial position. Industry Leadership and Signaling: Being an early mover in holding Bitcoin can attract investor attention, particularly from those interested in the crypto space. It signals a forward-thinking approach to treasury management and a belief in the future of digital assets. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury diversifies holdings away from traditional fiat currencies and financial instruments, reducing concentration risk. Metaplanet and the Japan Bitcoin Scene Metaplanet’s aggressive move is particularly significant within the context of Japan Bitcoin adoption. While Japan is a major economic power and has a relatively mature regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies compared to some nations, widespread corporate adoption of Bitcoin as a treasury asset hasn’t been as prominent as in some Western countries, notably the US. Metaplanet is positioning itself as a leader in the Japan Bitcoin space for corporate treasury. Their repeated actions could potentially serve as a case study and encourage other Japanese firms to explore similar strategies. This $50 million bond issuance for a BTC purchase is one of the most significant corporate crypto-related financial maneuvers seen from a Japanese listed company to date, solidifying Metaplanet’s role as a key player in driving Corporate Bitcoin adoption in the region. Their public announcements on platforms like X not only inform investors but also serve as a form of advocacy for Bitcoin within the Japanese business community. Understanding the BTC Purchase Strategy: Bonds for Bitcoin Let’s break down the mechanism Metaplanet is using for this specific Bitcoin investment . They are issuing bonds, which is essentially taking on debt. This debt is then used to fund the purchase of Bitcoin. Here’s a simplified view: Metaplanet issues bonds to investors. Investors give Metaplanet cash. Metaplanet uses the cash raised from the bond issuance to buy Bitcoin on the open market. Over time, Metaplanet holds the Bitcoin, hoping its value increases. At the bond’s maturity date, Metaplanet must repay the principal amount to the bondholders (in this case, the original 6.4 billion JPY). The key advantage of 0% bonds is the lack of interest payments, which reduces the cost of the strategy. However, the primary risk remains the volatility of Bitcoin. If the price of Bitcoin falls significantly by the time the bonds mature, Metaplanet might have difficulty repaying the bondholders using the value of their BTC holdings, potentially requiring them to raise funds through other means or sell assets at a loss. This strategy is distinct from using cash reserves (which doesn’t incur debt but reduces liquidity) or issuing equity (which dilutes existing shareholders). Using debt amplifies potential gains (if BTC rises) but also amplifies potential losses (if BTC falls). Benefits and Challenges of this Bitcoin Investment Metaplanet’s latest move highlights several potential benefits and inherent challenges associated with using debt for a significant Bitcoin investment : Potential Benefits: Leveraged Upside: Using borrowed funds can magnify returns if the price of Bitcoin appreciates significantly. Low-Cost Financing: 0% bonds provide capital without the burden of interest payments, making the cost of acquiring Bitcoin very low. Capital Efficiency: Allows the company to acquire a substantial amount of Bitcoin without depleting existing cash reserves needed for operations. Attracting Crypto-Focused Investors: Reinforces their position as a ‘Bitcoin company,’ potentially attracting investors specifically interested in crypto exposure through a traditional stock. Inflation Hedge: Provides a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currency held on the balance sheet. Inherent Challenges: Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile. A significant downturn could make it difficult to repay the debt upon maturity. Repayment Risk: The principal amount must be repaid regardless of Bitcoin’s performance. If BTC value is insufficient, the company faces liquidity challenges. Regulatory Uncertainty: While Japan has regulations, the global crypto regulatory landscape is still evolving, posing potential risks. Public Perception: Some traditional investors may view this strategy as overly risky or speculative, potentially impacting stock valuation. How Does Metaplanet Compare to Other Corporate Bitcoin Holders? When discussing Corporate Bitcoin adoption , it’s impossible not to mention MicroStrategy, the US-based software company that pioneered the strategy of holding significant Bitcoin on its balance sheet, often funded through debt and equity offerings. Metaplanet is often referred to as “Japan’s MicroStrategy” due to its similar strategy. Here’s a quick comparison (figures are approximate and subject to change): Company Location Primary Business Estimated BTC Holdings Funding Strategy MicroStrategy USA Business Intelligence Software ~214,400 BTC Debt, Equity, Cash Flow Metaplanet Japan Financial Services, Real Estate ~141.07 BTC (before this purchase) Debt (0% Bonds), Cash Flow While Metaplanet’s holdings are significantly smaller than MicroStrategy’s behemoth stack, its strategy of consistently using low-cost debt specifically for BTC purchase is strikingly similar and demonstrates a high level of commitment relative to its size. This latest $50 million move will substantially increase Metaplanet’s total Metaplanet Bitcoin holdings, further solidifying its position among publicly traded companies with Bitcoin on their balance sheet. What Does This Mean for the Future of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption? Metaplanet’s continued commitment, especially using a substantial bond issuance for a BTC purchase , sends a strong signal. It suggests that despite market volatility, some companies see Bitcoin as a legitimate, long-term treasury asset. This move could: Encourage Peers: Other Japanese companies might observe Metaplanet’s strategy and consider similar approaches, potentially accelerating Japan Bitcoin adoption at the corporate level. Validate the Strategy: Each successful instance of a company executing this strategy adds credibility to the idea of holding Bitcoin on a corporate balance sheet. Increase Demand: More companies buying Bitcoin for treasury purposes adds consistent buying pressure to the market. Influence Investors: As more companies adopt Bitcoin, traditional investors may become more comfortable with the asset class. The trend of Corporate Bitcoin adoption is still relatively nascent but is gaining momentum, driven by companies like MicroStrategy and now, notably, Metaplanet in Japan. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors, Metaplanet’s announcement offers several points to consider: Watch Metaplanet’s Stock: The company’s stock price may react to this news and its future Bitcoin investment performance. Investors interested in gaining exposure to Bitcoin through a publicly traded company, particularly in Asia, might look at Metaplanet. Monitor Bitcoin Price: While $50 million is not a massive sum in the context of Bitcoin’s total market cap, it represents consistent institutional demand. Keep an eye on how corporate buys influence market dynamics. Research the Strategy: Understand the risks and rewards of a company using debt to buy volatile assets. This strategy isn’t without potential downsides. Look for Ripple Effects: Observe if other Japanese or Asian companies follow Metaplanet’s lead into Corporate Bitcoin adoption . Metaplanet’s decision reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is transitioning from a purely speculative asset to a recognized treasury reserve asset for a growing number of forward-thinking corporations. Conclusion Metaplanet’s announcement to issue $50 million in 0% bonds specifically for a BTC purchase is a significant development. It not only reinforces the company’s deep commitment to its Metaplanet Bitcoin strategy but also serves as a powerful signal for Japan Bitcoin adoption within the corporate sector. By leveraging low-cost debt for this substantial Bitcoin investment , Metaplanet is doubling down on its belief in Bitcoin as a long-term store of value and a potential enhancer of shareholder value. This move positions Metaplanet as a frontrunner in Corporate Bitcoin adoption in Asia and adds another chapter to the ongoing story of how companies are integrating digital assets into their financial strategies. As the landscape evolves, actions like these from publicly traded firms underscore the increasing mainstream acceptance and strategic importance of Bitcoin in the global economy.

I noticed that BTC just set a new all time high and that was great to see,” he said. Bitcoin recently broke through the $111K level and set a new record. It has held steady at $109K today, with rising institutional interest and ETF inflows. Traders are also betting on new highs in the coming months. Bitcoin – The Financial System of Future “Bitcoin, crypto, this is the financial system of the future. And we want this innovation to happen in the United States. We don’t want it driven offshore,” he said. “The president definitely got us off on the right foot and he wants to unleash oil and gas production in the US.” Sacks also said that both artificial intelligence (AI) and Bitcoin mining require a lot of electricity to work. He stressed that the U.S. needs to boost energy production big time to keep leading in both tech fields. Can The Government Purchase More BTC? In an interesting revelation, Sacks said that the government could purchase more Bitcoin if the Commerce or Treasury Department can find a way to fund it without increasing the debt. Thousands of Bitcoin fans flooded Las Vegas this week for BTC Inc.’s annual conference. The event featured big names and there was a “5x” increase in participation on behalf of institutional investors from a year prior. More countries are adopting Bitcoin, including Pakistan yesterday.

Up until this point, Bitcoin’s architecture focused on decentralization and security, but it did not provide access to tokens other than BTC. Asset Runes will address that, enabling users to access the wider crypto economy while remaining on Bitcoin. Starknet’s expanding engagement with the Bitcoin ecosystem is further enhanced by this launch. On May 14, Starknet announced a partnership with Lombard Finance to onboard LBTC, a leading Bitcoin liquid staking token. A proof-of-concept known as Broly was also unveiled, which enables the direct triggering of Bitcoin inscriptions from Starknet wallets, thereby creating new use cases for Bitcoin native technology. Starknet also intends to launch Bitcoin staking in Q3 2025. This will allow users to stake wrapped versions of Bitcoin and earn STRK rewards, opening the door for more DeFi use cases like lending, borrowing, and yield farming.

2025-05-28T07:04:55.000Z,"Crypto Trader Unveils ‘Absolute Worst-Case’ Scenario for Bitcoin As BTC Struggles To Clear $110,000","A widely followed crypto strategist believes that shallow corrections are the norm for Bitcoin as BTC flashes strong upside momentum. Pseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 864,500 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin looks bullish amid sustained demand from corporations and exchange-traded fund (ETF) investors. According to the trader, the steady inflows suggest that a drop below $100,000 would represent the bleakest scenario for BTC at this stage. “I’d only be concerned for BTC if we lost [$104,000] and started to close under the previous all-time high closes and range highs. Absolute worst case in my opinion would be mid $90,000s. For now, we are trading above. So, bias should be continuation. Even then, I don’t think there’s enough supply to stay down for long at the rate it’s being GOBBLED up. ETFs have that gluck gluck 3000 going and are sucking supply dry, absolutely milking it and same with Saylor The printers never truly stop.” Source: Pentoshi/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $108,959. According to Pentoshi, Bitcoin is on track to break out against gold, ultimately leaving the precious metal far behind. “At some point, BTC is going to make new highs vs Gold and never look back. The fastest growing ETF in history tells you everything you need to know, as well as the companies getting exposure.” Source: Pentoshi/X Turning to the layer-1 protocol Solana, the analyst thinks SOL will head above $200 if it manages to convert the $180 resistance into support. “SOL hit $187 today. Flip this area to support, and we see $220 next in my opinion.” Source: Pentoshi/X At time of writing, SOL is worth $176.

2025-05-28T07:00:50.000Z,"US Set To Reign As ‘Bitcoin Superpower,’ Declares Trump’s Digital Assets Chief","At the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, a session titled “Making America the Global Bitcoin Superpower” conveyed a clear message: the United States is committed to embracing Bitcoin (BTC) and leading the global market. Key speakers Bo Hines, the White House Executive Director for digital assets, and Tyler Williams from the US Treasury Department, alongside moderator Miles Jennings, outlined the government’s aggressive strategy to establish the nation as a leader in the cryptocurrency space. Integration Of Crypto With ‘Legacy Financial Systems’ “We are well on our way to becoming the Bitcoin superpower of the world,” Hines declared, emphasizing that this initiative transcends partisan politics. He described the movement as a “revolution in our financial system” that requires immediate action. Jennings pointed out the critical regulatory measures that are currently being developed. “If the bill becomes law, we will play a significant role in integrating Bitcoin, stablecoins, and other digital assets with the legacy financial system,” he stated. This integration, he noted, would be facilitated by pending stablecoin legislation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retraces Below $109,000: Analysts Split on Future Outlook Hines highlighted the importance of modernizing payment systems, asserting, “Updating the payment rails is necessary, and we are making significant progress.” He noted that forthcoming market structure legislation would clarify the regulatory landscape for intermediaries such as exchanges and brokers, determining whether digital assets will be classified as securities or commodities. Encouraging innovation within the crypto sector, Hines remarked, “We want folks to innovate here. We can’t let fear of regulatory repercussions stifle creativity.” He urged innovators who have moved abroad to consider returning, stating, “Our message to those who have gone offshore is: welcome home.” ‘Bitcoin Is The Golden Standard’ Williams reinforced the need for any new regulations to accommodate the unique nature of decentralized finance (DeFi). “Traditional financial markets operate on a principal-agent model, but crypto is shifting us toward a principal-to-principal structure,” he explained. He noted that regulatory support for the exchange-traded products (ETP) marketplace had led to a surge in institutional Bitcoin adoption, and he believes that similar outcomes could arise from stablecoin and market structure legislation. Related Reading: Dogecoin Enters Danger Zone — Chartist Predicts Sharp Drop Ahead Hines made a particularly bullish statement, declaring, “Bitcoin is truly the golden standard. This is an asset that we should be harnessing on behalf of the American people. We want as much as we can possibly get.” Tyler Williams echoed this sentiment, asserting, “We are going big on digital assets.” Hines concluded the session with a strong commitment: “You will certainly see the United States stepping out as the Bitcoin superpower of the world.” As of this writing, the market’s leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), is trading at $108,560, just over 2.8% below its all-time high of $111,800, which was reached last week amid renewed investments in the Bitcoin ETF market.

2025-05-28T07:00:34.000Z,"Early Signs of Retail Interest in Bitcoin (BTC), But No Breakout Yet","As Bitcoin trades near its recently established ATH, a crucial factor is missing from the surge: widespread retail activity. But the latest data points to early signs of movement. Such a comeback could push the world’s largest cryptocurrency to secure more gains. Early Signs of Retail Interest CryptoQuant’s analysis highlighted a notable disconnect in the current Bitcoin rally. As BTC hit new all-time highs in Q2 2025, retail investor activity remained subdued. Data tracking Bitcoin transfers in the $0-$10,000 range, a common proxy for retail demand, shows a marginal increase despite rising prices. The 30-day percentage change in retail volume remains mostly flat, suggesting that large investors and institutions are primarily fueling the rally at this stage. Historical patterns from previous bull markets, such as in 2020-2021, indicate that while institutional momentum often initiates the uptrend, sustained and accelerated growth typically requires strong retail participation. Without a significant increase in retail demand, the current price surge may lack long-term stability. However, CryptoQuant observed early signs of retail interest. While these have yet to develop into a meaningful breakout, the key takeaway is that for Bitcoin’s price to continue its upward trajectory sustainably, a clear boost in retail investor engagement is essential. Should retail volume pick up in the coming weeks, the new all-time highs may mark just the beginning of a broader rally. Institutional demand, on the other hand, remained firm as evidenced by spot Bitcoin ETFs recording $385 million in net inflows on May 27, thereby extending their streak of daily net inflows to nine consecutive sessions. Drivers of Bitcoin’s Next Bull Run If the retail fails to make a comeback, CryptoQuant’s Julio Moreno expects the next crypto “mania” may be driven not by retail investors but by smaller firms and funds following Michael Saylor’s BTC accumulation model. However, it is important for these entities to be ready to endure the cryptocurrency’s notorious volatility, especially during sharp market downturns. Increasingly, non-crypto companies are adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Japan’s Metaplanet, with 7,800 BTC, is leading the trend, alongside Hong Kong-based Boyaa Interactive with 2,410 BTC in Asia, while US-based Semler Scientific currently holds 3,808 BTC. All these firms are aiming to replicate the high-profile success of Saylor’s strategy and integrate Bitcoin into their long-term financial positioning.

2025-05-28T07:00:01.000Z,"Bitcoin Entering Price Discovery? Golden Ratio Multiplier Suggests $130,000 Ahead","Bitcoin (BTC) appears to be gearing up for another price discovery phase. The leading digital asset by market capitalization has gained an impressive 17.4% over the past month, setting a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,980 on May 22. Bitcoin Ready To Enter Price Discovery Mode? According to a recent X post by crypto analyst Titan of Crypto, BTC may soon enter price discovery mode once again. The analyst shared the following daily chart indicating that Bitcoin is targeting the blue line of the Golden Ratio Multiplier, with a potential price target of $130,000. For the uninitiated, the Golden Ratio Multiplier is a Bitcoin price model that applies Fibonacci multiples – such as 1.6, 2, 3, 5 – to the 350-day moving average to identify potential resistance and support levels during market cycles. The indicator helps visualize when Bitcoin is overbought or undervalued relative to its long-term trend. On a broader time frame, BTC also seems to be following a Fibonacci Extension pattern, with the next major resistance projected at $135,000. Interestingly, Bitcoin followed a similar pattern in November 2025, which was followed by the creation of multiple new ATHs. In a separate X post , fellow crypto analyst Jelle noted an interesting observation. Despite BTC trading near its ATH, funding rates on major crypto exchanges – such as Binance, OKX, and Bybit – remain in negative territory. Negative funding rates imply that a majority of traders are betting against BTC, expecting a short-term pullback. However, if the price continues its bullish trajectory, it could trigger a wave of short liquidations, potentially propelling Bitcoin to even higher levels . Analyst Ted Pillows has also weighed in, predicting that BTC may reach $130,000 as early as July 2025. His projection aligns with the ongoing bullish sentiment supported by technical indicators and institutional interest. Some Signs Of Caution While the bullish momentum continues, some analysts urge caution. Veteran Bitcoin enthusiast Willy Woo recently noted that the ‘Structure Shift’ signal is beginning to show early signs of a bearish pivot. Woo pointed out that capital inflows into the Bitcoin network have remained ‘very flat’ over the past three days. Woo warned that if BTC fails to establish new highs soon, it could lead to bearish divergences forming on long-term charts. Nevertheless, he emphasized that the broader outlook remains optimistic , with a possible upside target of $114,000 if Bitcoin maintains its upward momentum. Adding to the positive outlook, Pillows also forecasted that BTC could hit $120,000 in the coming months, suggesting the asset is in the final phase of the Wyckoff Accumulation pattern. At press time, BTC trades at $109,491, up 0.1% in the past 24 hours.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-entering-price-discovery-golden-ratio-multiplier-suggests-130000-ahead/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|Fibonacci Extension|Golden Ratio Multiplier|negative funding rates|Technical Analysis",cryptocompare
2025-05-28T06:51:55.000Z,"Bitfinex Alpha | Cẩn Trọng Với Đợt Chốt Lời Sắp Tới!","Xem Full Báo cáo TẠo Tài Khoản Bitfinex Sau khi giảm 32% từ mức đỉnh lịch sử hồi tháng Giêng, BTC đã bật tăng hơn 50%, đạt mức cao mới $111,880 trước khi bước vào giai đoạn nghỉ ngơi đầy khỏe khoắn. Sự đổ bộ mạnh mẽ của dòng tiền từ các quỹ ETF, sự tham gia sôi động của thị trường giao ngay và sự tăng trưởng tích cực trong vốn hóa thực hiện ròng đã tạo nên làn sóng mua bền vững thay vì chỉ đơn thuần là cơn sốt đầu cơ. Dù tâm lý e ngại rủi ro vĩ mô đang quay trở lại – đặc biệt với tin tức Mỹ có thể áp thuế nhập khẩu lên tới 50% đối với hàng hóa châu Âu – Bitcoin vẫn đứng vững như một chiến binh thép, hấp thụ đợt chốt lời và giải phóng đòn bẩy dư thừa mà không hề sụp đổ nghiêm trọng. Tuy nhiên, với mức tăng mạnh như vậy, khả năng xuất hiện đợt chốt lời lớn ở vùng giá hiện tại đang ngày càng rõ ràng. Khả năng phục hồi ngoạn mục này đang thu hút sự chú ý đến vai trò ngày càng tiến hóa của Bitcoin – một tài sản nhạy cảm với biến động kinh tế vĩ mô, được thúc đẩy bởi niềm tin chứ không còn phụ thuộc vào cảm xúc ngắn hạn của nhà đầu tư nhỏ lẻ. Đáng chú ý, việc Metaplanet tích lũy 104 triệu đô la Bitcoin và đề xuất lập pháp thân thiện với crypto tại Michigan đã củng cố câu chuyện về sự hỗ trợ ngày càng lớn từ các tổ chức và chính sách cấp cao dành cho tài sản kỹ thuật số. Khả năng Bitcoin tiếp tục duy trì trên mức chi phí cơ sở của những nhà nắm giữ ngắn hạn – khoảng $95,000 – sẽ là yếu tố then chốt quyết định xu hướng sắp tới. Với hơn 11,4 tỷ đô la lợi nhuận ngắn hạn đã được thực hiện trong tháng qua, nguồn cung dư thừa ngắn hạn chắc chắn sẽ xuất hiện – nhưng cầu cấu trúc cũng sẽ không kém phần mạnh mẽ. Sức mạnh của dòng tiền ETF, độ biến động thấp và mức phí premium trên thị trường giao ngay đều gợi ý rằng thị trường đang dần trưởng thành, sẵn sàng cho một đợt bứt phá mới khi tình hình vĩ mô trở nên rõ ràng hơn. Những tuần tới có thể sẽ trả lời câu hỏi: Liệu đợt breakout vừa rồi của Bitcoin là đỉnh cục bộ hay chỉ là khúc dạo đầu cho một đợt tăng mạnh hơn vào Quý 3? Trong khi đó, bức tranh kinh tế Mỹ đang trở nên u ám hơn bao giờ hết. Lợi suất trái phiếu dài hạn tăng vọt, đồng đô la suy yếu giữa bối cảnh xếp hạng tín dụng giảm, nợ công leo thang và nguy cơ áp thuế khiến niềm tin nhà đầu tư lung lay dữ dội. Lợi suất trái phiếu kỳ hạn 10 năm và 30 năm lần lượt vượt ngưỡng 4,5% và 5% , phản ánh sự hoài nghi về kỷ luật tài khóa và nguy cơ lạm phát leo thang. Đường cong lợi suất 30Y/10Y – vốn thường được coi là tín hiệu tăng trưởng – giờ đây lại phơi bày nỗi lo sợ về rủi ro dài hạn thay vì niềm lạc quan. Với nhu cầu nước ngoài suy giảm và sự hỗ trợ từ Fed đối với thị trường trái phiếu dần phai nhạt, các thị trường đang định giá một kỷ nguyên mới với lãi suất cao hơn và biến động nhiều hơn . Thị trường trái phiếu không còn phản ứng theo từng dòng tin tức nữa – nó đang gửi đi một thông điệp mạnh mẽ: Cách chúng ta định giá rủi ro đang thay đổi cơ bản. Tuần vừa rồi, cả sự chấp nhận từ các tổ chức lẫn động lực quy định đều đạt được những bước tiến đáng kể. Các công ty niêm yết Strategy, Metaplanet và Semler Scientific đã cùng nhau tích lũy hơn 8,800 BTC , củng cố vị thế của Bitcoin như một tài sản chiến lược trong kho bạc doanh nghiệp. Đáng chú ý, Strategy hiện nắm giữ hơn 2,7% tổng cung Bitcoin, minh chứng cho xu hướng ngày càng nhiều tập đoàn coi BTC là dự trữ dài hạn trong thời kỳ bất ổn kinh tế. Về phía ứng dụng, FIFA đã gây chú ý khi thông báo xây dựng blockchain riêng trên nền tảng Avalanche, chấm dứt mối quan hệ với các đối tác cũ như Algorand và Polygon. Mạng lưới mới tương thích với EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) sẽ giúp các nhà phát triển và người hâm mộ dễ dàng tiếp cận các bộ sưu tập kỹ thuật số hơn, mở đường cho FIFA mở rộng tham vọng Web3 của mình.

2025-05-28T06:50:24.000Z,"MicroStrategy Stock Performance: Unstoppable MSTR Outpaces All 74 Crypto ETFs YTD","BitcoinWorld MicroStrategy Stock Performance: Unstoppable MSTR Outpaces All 74 Crypto ETFs YTD In a fascinating twist for digital asset investors, MicroStrategy stock performance has stolen the spotlight this year, achieving a feat many might find surprising. According to Nate Geraci, CEO of the U.S.-based wealth management firm The ETF Store, the company formerly known as Strategy has significantly outperformed every single one of the 74 crypto-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracked year-to-date. Understanding the Surprising MicroStrategy Stock Performance MicroStrategy (MSTR) is widely recognized not just as a business intelligence software company, but increasingly, as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin (BTC). This strategic pivot has tightly linked the company’s stock performance to the volatile world of cryptocurrency. While many investors seeking crypto exposure might turn to dedicated Crypto ETFs, MSTR’s stock has proven to be a more potent vehicle for gains in the current market cycle, at least so far this year. Nate Geraci’s observation, shared on X, highlights a significant trend: despite the proliferation of regulated investment products designed to track cryptocurrencies, a single company’s stock, heavily invested in Bitcoin, has managed to lead the pack. This includes funds specifically designed for leverage, such as the MSTR ETF (MSTX), which aims to track 2x the performance of MicroStrategy’s stock itself – yet, even this leveraged vehicle lagged behind the underlying MSTR shares. Why is MSTR vs Crypto ETFs Showing Such a Disparity? The outperformance of MicroStrategy stock compared to a broad spectrum of Crypto ETFs can be attributed to several factors: Concentrated Bitcoin Exposure: MSTR’s strategy is laser-focused on accumulating Bitcoin. While many crypto ETFs offer exposure to a basket of digital assets or Bitcoin futures, MSTR provides a more direct, albeit leveraged through its corporate structure, play on the price movement of the leading cryptocurrency. Investor Perception and Flow: For many investors, particularly institutional ones, buying MSTR stock is seen as a relatively accessible and regulated way to gain significant exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset or navigating the complexities of various crypto ETF structures. This consistent demand can drive the stock price. Business Operations Multiplier: While Bitcoin holdings are the primary driver of recent MSTR performance, the company still has an operational business. The market valuation of MSTR often reflects not just the value of its Bitcoin treasury, but also a premium placed on the company as a unique investment vehicle, potentially amplifying gains during bullish crypto cycles. ETF Structure and Fees: Crypto ETFs have varying structures (spot, futures, baskets) and come with management fees. These factors, along with potential tracking errors or diversification across less performing assets within a basket ETF, can dilute or lag the performance compared to a single, highly focused stock like MSTR during a strong Bitcoin rally. The Role of MicroStrategy as a Bitcoin Corporate Holder MicroStrategy pioneered the strategy of holding significant amounts of Bitcoin on its corporate balance sheet. Led by Michael Saylor, the company has aggressively acquired BTC, making it the most prominent Bitcoin Corporate Holder globally. This commitment has transformed MSTR into a de facto Bitcoin investment vehicle for many, influencing its market valuation far beyond its core software business. This unique position means that when Bitcoin’s price surges, MSTR’s stock tends to react strongly, often with amplified volatility compared to Bitcoin itself or diversified crypto funds. The market essentially values MSTR based heavily on its per-share Bitcoin holdings, plus a premium (or sometimes a discount) related to its operational business and debt used for acquisitions. What Does This Mean for Crypto ETF Performance and Investors? The fact that MSTR has outperformed 74 different Crypto ETFs highlights the diverse and sometimes complex landscape of digital asset investing: Not All Crypto Exposure is Equal: This performance gap underscores that different investment vehicles offering ‘crypto exposure’ can yield vastly different results due to structure, fees, underlying assets, and market dynamics. Due Diligence is Crucial: Investors considering crypto-related investments must look beyond just the ‘crypto’ label. Understanding the specific strategy, holdings, fees, and structure of an ETF – or the unique nature of a stock like MSTR – is vital. MSTR’s Unique Position: MSTR isn’t a typical tech stock anymore, nor is it a typical ETF. Its performance is a testament to its specific, high-conviction Bitcoin accumulation strategy and the market’s reaction to it. While Nate Geraci’s data point is compelling for year-to-date performance, it’s crucial for investors to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results. The dynamics that favored MSTR in the recent period could shift. Actionable Insights for Navigating MSTR and Crypto ETFs Given the insights from the recent Crypto ETF Performance data, here are some points for investors to consider: Understand Your Goal: Are you seeking broad crypto market exposure, specific Bitcoin exposure, or a leveraged play? Your goal should dictate your investment vehicle. Evaluate Structure and Risk: MSTR comes with corporate risk, debt risk (from borrowing to buy BTC), and stock market volatility in addition to Bitcoin price risk. ETFs have risks related to tracking error, counterparty exposure (especially futures ETFs), and management fees. Compare Fees: ETF expense ratios can eat into returns over time. While MSTR doesn’t have an explicit management fee like an ETF, its operational costs and debt financing have implications. Diversification: Relying heavily on a single stock like MSTR for crypto exposure concentrates risk. Crypto ETFs, even basket ones, can offer some level of diversification within the digital asset space, though this didn’t guarantee outperformance this year. Stay Informed: Follow experts like Nate Geraci and analyze the underlying drivers of performance for both individual stocks and ETFs. The story of MicroStrategy stock performance outpacing a wide array of Crypto ETFs this year serves as a powerful reminder that the path to digital asset exposure is multifaceted and requires careful consideration. Conclusion: A Surprising Leader in the Crypto Investment Race Nate Geraci’s observation that MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock has outperformed all 74 tracked crypto ETFs year-to-date is a significant data point in the evolving narrative of cryptocurrency investing. It underscores the unique position MicroStrategy holds as a Bitcoin Corporate Holder and the market’s current appetite for this specific type of leveraged Bitcoin exposure through a public company structure. While Crypto ETF Performance offers regulated and varied ways to access the digital asset market, MSTR’s concentrated bet on Bitcoin has delivered superior returns in the recent bullish environment. Investors should use this information to deepen their understanding of the different vehicles available, weigh the associated risks and benefits, and make informed decisions aligned with their own investment strategy.

The broader Bitcoin price action has remained range-bound since the May 21 peak near $111,889, with technical indicators now signaling caution.

The recent drop from the upper bound has pushed BTC back below the 20 and 50 EMA lines ($109,144 and $108,244), while the price now flirts with Bollinger Band midlines and support clusters near $108,500. From a pattern perspective, the structure resembles a rising wedge breakdown or a rounded top, especially after repeated failures to breach the $110,400–$110,800 supply zone.

Trading activity remains strong, with the volume at $129 billion, which has surged 19.59% overnight. Talking about sentiments of marketers, the Fear & Greed Index stands at a greed driven score of 68. However, the Altcoin Season Index at 23/100 indicates that Bitcoin remains the dominant force in the market. While Bitcoin continues to hold a firm grip on the market, the short-term volatility still puzzles not one but many. In this analysis, we see how Bitcoin has been doing behind the scenes, that is, onchain wise, and also explore Bitcoin price analysis for the short-term. Smart DCA and Holder Cost Basis Reflect Bullish Strength? As per the analysis by Axel , the ongoing Bitcoin bull cycle has seen a clear execution of the Smart Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy. All four buy triggers identified through cost-basis analysis have led to positive returns on investment, justifying the effectiveness of DCA in volatile markets. He highlights that the toughest buy point was Trigger #1, executed near the bear market bottom at $16k. Recent data from CryptoQuant further supports this bullish structure. Since Bitcoin reached the $97k mark, the realized cost basis for both short-term and long-term holders has started to climb higher. In particular, the 7-day rate of change for long-term holders has hit a cycle high, signaling strong conviction and reduced profit-taking from experienced investors. Bitcoin Price Analysis Bitcoin price today is at $108,969.44, with a 0.16% daily and 1.45% weekly gain. The market cap stands at $2.16 trillion, backed by a 24-hour volume of $53.17 billion. Intraday price fluctuations remain tight, with a low of $108,445.43 and a high of $110,744.21. Technical indicators from the 4H chart show the RSI hovering around 49.85, reflecting a neutral momentum, while the price trades near the SMA-9, hinting at short-term consolidation before the next directional move.

BREAKING NEWS: RIPPLE CLO STUART ALDEROTY SAYS THAT „RIPPLE SUBMITTED AN ADDITIONAL LETTER TO THE SEC‘S CRYPTO TASK FORCE!“ #XRP https://t.co/MLOu861GDs pic.twitter.com/rpOpSNhNCA — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) May 27, 2025 XRP Ruling Supports the Case Referencing Judge Torres’s ruling in the SEC v. Ripple case, where the court said XRP sales on exchanges are not securities . He also mentioned a legal paper by Lewis Cohen, which says a token only counts as a security if there’s a clear relationship between the buyer and seller. This doesn’t happen when people trade tokens on exchanges. New Rules Should Come From Congress According to Alderoty, the SEC should not make new rules on its own. He believes Congress should be the one to create laws for the crypto market. He said that guidance based on existing laws would help clear up confusion for everyone. While acknowledging that crypto regulation still has gaps, Alderoty firmly stated that the SEC cannot create new rules on its own. Instead, he called on Congress to establish a legal framework tailored for the digital asset space. According to him, regulatory clarity must come from lawmakers, not regulators overstepping their authority. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP News: Why Did Ripple Submit An Additional Letter To Crypto Task Force? , Possible Scenario for Security Status Meanwhile, Ripple has suggested using a ‘network maturity’ test to help decide if a crypto token should still be treated like a security. This test looks at things like how big the project has become, how long it has been running, and how control is spread out. Ripple says a token should only be considered a security if two things happen at the same time: if the original promises from the issuer haven’t been fulfilled, and if the current holder has legal rights to those promises. If not, the token should be treated separately from the original investment contract. This move is seen as part of Ripple’s effort to clear the legal path for a possible future ETF. The Push for Fairer Crypto Rules Grows This request from Ripple follows similar calls from the Blockchain Association and others who want the SEC to stop applying traditional finance rules to crypto. With big names like BlackRock also talking to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force , the push for better rules is only getting stronger. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-28T06:43:24.000Z,"Bitcoin Outlook & New Stablecoin Investment Opportunities Amidst Evolving Macro Landscape","Singapore, May 27, 2025 – HTX Research, the research arm of HTX, has just released a crucial new report: “ The New Macroeconomic Landscape and Bitcoin Outlook: An Analysis of Liquidity, Risk Appetite, Policy Dynamics, and Investment Strategy. “ This comprehensive analysis comes at a pivotal time, as the global macroeconomic landscape undergoes profound shifts and the cryptocurrency market, especially Bitcoin’s price movements, becomes increasingly influenced by this complex backdrop. The report offers investors valuable insights, a clear market outlook, and strategic investment guidance on how evolving macroeconomic conditions are shaping the Bitcoin market. Bitcoin Outlook in the Macro Environment: Liquidity & Market Risk Appetite The current global macro environment is complex. A combination of factors, including cooling expectations for Fed rate cuts, ongoing quantitative tightening (QT), the replenishment of the U.S. Treasury General Account (TGA), and anticipated rate hikes by the Bank of Japan, are collectively contributing to tighter short-term liquidity. Over the medium term (3–12 months), liquidity is expected to gradually improve. However, uncertainty surrounding market risk appetite presents both opportunities and challenges for the Bitcoin market. Policy Tug-of-War Signals Crypto-Friendly Shifts: A Loosening Grip on Stablecoin Regulation? The ongoing policy debate is having a significant impact on the crypto market. In a notable development, Hong Kong’s Legislative Council has passed the Stablecoin Bill, which establishes a comprehensive licensing regime for fiat-backed stablecoin issuers in Hong Kong. This legislation further refines the regulatory framework for virtual asset activities within the region, aiming to foster financial stability and consumer protection. The more profound and complex policy impacts are unfolding in the United States. The Trump administration’s “Big Beautiful Tax Plan”, aimed at reducing taxes by $5 trillion over the next decade, has boosted market sentiment in the short term. However, the growing fiscal deficit and debt ceiling issues could spark liquidity volatility. Regarding regulation, the U.S. Senate is making progress on stablecoin legislation. The GENIUS Act seeks to establish a standardized framework for the stablecoin market, mandating backing by 100% high-quality asset reserves. Negotiations have reportedly reached a consensus on approximately 90% of the terms, signaling a strong bipartisan push for regulatory clarity in this critical sector. Additionally, the accelerated exploration of tokenized U.S. equities is noteworthy, with the U.S. SEC is actively researching and evaluating this space, while major financial institutions (e.g., JPMorgan) are strategically positioning themselves in this emerging field. Furthermore, U.S. federal and state initiatives to legislate “strategic Bitcoin reserves,” such as New Hampshire’s H.B. 302 bill, are further elevating Bitcoin’s strategic importance and providing policy support for increased institutional participation.These developments collectively indicate a growing recognition and integration of digital assets within traditional financial and governmental structures. HTX Lists USD1 and Other Compliant Stablecoins, Introduces Zero-Fee Conversion With global policy easing on the horizon and a growing push for regulatory clarity, stablecoins are increasingly solidifying their role as the foundation of liquidity and value pegs within the crypto market. Recognizing this pivotal opportunity, HTX has recently launched a range of compliant stablecoins, including USD1 (World Liberty Financial USD), USDQ (Quantoz), EURQ (Quantoz), USDR (StablR), EURR (StablR),and AETHUSDT (Aave Ethereum USDT). This expansion is designed to meet diverse user investment preferences and boost capital efficiency. To celebrate the launch of USD1 and reduce barriers to user participation, HTX is offering a special zero-fee conversion service. From now until December 31, 2025, at 15:59 (UTC), users can trade the USD1/USDT spot pair with no trading fees. This initiative ensures users incur no additional costs during conversion, thereby maximizing their capital utilization. The report concludes that the Bitcoin market may encounter liquidity pressures and volatility risks in the short term. However, the medium to long term holds significant potential for a rebound. This optimistic outlook is largely supported by clearer regulatory policies and growing institutional adoption. . HTX will continue to closely monitor market and regulatory trends to help users seize opportunities and achieve steady growth in the complex and evolving crypto landscape.

2025-05-28T06:40:20.000Z,"Bitcoin Season: Altcoin Season Index at 25 Signals Crucial Crypto Market Insight","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Season: Altcoin Season Index at 25 Signals Crucial Crypto Market Insight Are you navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrency ? Understanding market cycles is crucial, and one key indicator investors watch is the Altcoin Season Index . This metric provides valuable insight into whether Bitcoin or altcoins are currently leading the charge in the broader crypto market . What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index, tracked by platforms like CoinMarketCap, is a tool designed to measure the relative performance of altcoins compared to Bitcoin over a specific period. It helps participants in the crypto market understand the prevailing trend – whether it’s a period where altcoins are generally outperforming Bitcoin (Altcoin Season) or vice versa ( Bitcoin Season ). Here’s how the index generally works: It typically analyzes the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens. The comparison is made against Bitcoin’s performance over a set timeframe, often the past 90 days. The index score is usually represented on a scale, commonly from 1 to 100. Decoding the Index Score: Altcoin Season vs. Bitcoin Season The index score directly indicates which ‘season’ the crypto market is in. Based on the commonly accepted criteria: Altcoin Season: This occurs when a significant majority of the top altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the measured period. The threshold is often set at 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins showing better performance than BTC. An index score typically above 75 signifies Altcoin Season. Bitcoin Season: This is the opposite scenario. It happens when Bitcoin is largely outperforming the majority of altcoins. The threshold is often set at 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins outperforming BTC. An index score typically below 25 signifies Bitcoin Season . Neither Season: Scores between these thresholds (e.g., 26-74) suggest a period where the market is more mixed, with no clear dominance by either Bitcoin or altcoins as a whole. Why the Index at 25 Signals Bitcoin Season As reported, the Altcoin Season Index recently registered a score of 25. According to the standard criteria used by many market trackers, including CoinMarketCap, a score of 25 or below indicates that 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. This firmly places the current crypto market environment in Bitcoin Season . This score, remaining unchanged recently, reinforces the observation that Bitcoin has been the dominant performer relative to most altcoins over the last three months. While individual altcoins may have seen pumps, the broad market trend among the top players favors BTC. What Does Bitcoin Season Mean for Your Cryptocurrency Investments? Being in Bitcoin Season has several implications for participants in the crypto market : Focus on Bitcoin: Historically, during Bitcoin Season, capital tends to flow disproportionately into Bitcoin. This can lead to BTC’s price appreciating faster than many altcoins, and its market dominance increasing. Altcoin Underperformance: Many altcoins may trade sideways, experience smaller gains, or even decline against their BTC pair during this period. Potential Opportunities: While challenging for broad altcoin gains, Bitcoin Season can present opportunities to accumulate promising altcoins at lower prices relative to Bitcoin, in anticipation of a future shift back to Altcoin Season. Risk Management: Investing heavily in smaller, less established altcoins during Bitcoin Season can carry higher risk, as their performance is often more volatile and susceptible to downturns when Bitcoin is leading. Understanding this market phase helps investors align their strategies. It’s a time when a ‘buy the dip’ approach might be more effective for Bitcoin, or when selectively choosing altcoins with strong fundamentals becomes even more critical. What Factors Contribute to Bitcoin Season? Several factors can contribute to the crypto market entering and staying in Bitcoin Season : Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of global economic uncertainty, investors often view Bitcoin as a relatively safer haven within the volatile crypto space compared to smaller altcoins. Institutional Interest: Large institutional investors often enter the market through Bitcoin first due to its liquidity and established infrastructure (like Bitcoin ETFs). Their significant capital inflows primarily boost BTC. Halving Cycles: The Bitcoin halving event often precedes or coincides with periods of increased Bitcoin dominance, as attention and capital flow towards BTC in anticipation of supply reduction. Market Sentiment: A general shift in sentiment favoring larger, more established assets can benefit Bitcoin over riskier altcoins. Profit-Taking from Altcoins: After a period of altcoin gains, investors may take profits and rotate capital back into Bitcoin, which is seen as more stable. When Could the Market Shift Back to Altcoin Season? Predicting the exact timing of a shift from Bitcoin Season back to Altcoin Season is impossible, but certain indicators can signal a potential change: Increasing Altcoin Outperformance: The most direct signal is when a growing number of altcoins start consistently outperforming Bitcoin over the 90-day period, causing the Altcoin Season Index to rise significantly (towards 75+). Decreasing Bitcoin Dominance: While not the same as the index, a sustained drop in Bitcoin’s market dominance (its percentage of the total crypto market cap) often precedes or accompanies Altcoin Season. Breakout in Specific Altcoin Categories: Often, a new Altcoin Season is kicked off by strong performance in specific sectors like DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2 solutions, or specific narratives. Increased Retail Interest: Altcoin seasons are often fueled by renewed interest and capital from retail investors, who tend to gravitate towards the potential for higher percentage gains in altcoins. Positive Market Catalysts: Favorable regulatory news, technological breakthroughs in major altcoin projects, or a sustained period of bullish momentum in the overall market can trigger altcoin rallies. Investors should monitor the Altcoin Season Index and other market indicators closely for signs of this potential shift. It typically doesn’t happen overnight but evolves gradually. Challenges and Nuances of the Altcoin Season Index While a useful tool, the Altcoin Season Index isn’t perfect and has its nuances: Historical Data Reliance: It’s based on past 90-day performance, meaning it reflects the recent past and present, not necessarily predicting the future. Top 100 Limitation: The index only considers the top 100 coins. Many smaller cap altcoins might experience significant pumps during Bitcoin Season that aren’t reflected in this specific index. Market Cap Weighting: The index treats each of the top 100 coins equally in its calculation of outperformance percentage, regardless of their individual market capitalization. Definition Variations: Different platforms might use slightly different methodologies or thresholds for defining Altcoin vs. Bitcoin Season . Therefore, while the index provides a valuable high-level view of the crypto market trend, it should be used in conjunction with other analysis tools and research. Actionable Insights for the Current Bitcoin Season Given the current Altcoin Season Index reading of 25, here are some actionable insights for investors navigating the cryptocurrency space: Prioritize Bitcoin: Consider allocating a larger portion of your portfolio to Bitcoin, or focus on dollar-cost averaging into BTC during this period. Be Selective with Altcoins: If investing in altcoins, be highly selective. Focus on projects with strong fundamentals, clear use cases, active development, and solid community support. Avoid highly speculative or meme coins unless you understand the significant risks involved. Monitor Bitcoin Dominance: Keep an eye on Bitcoin’s market dominance chart. A significant downturn could be an early warning sign of capital rotating into altcoins. Watch the Index: Continuously monitor the Altcoin Season Index . A sustained move upwards is the most direct signal that the market sentiment is shifting. Educate Yourself: Use this time to research potential altcoin investments for when the season eventually shifts. Understanding projects deeply will position you better to capitalize on future altcoin rallies. Conclusion: Navigating the Current Crypto Market The Altcoin Season Index currently sitting at 25 provides a clear signal: the crypto market is experiencing Bitcoin Season . This means that over the past 90 days, Bitcoin has largely outperformed the vast majority of the top 100 altcoins. Understanding this phase is vital for investors to manage risk and identify potential opportunities. While the focus is currently on Bitcoin’s performance, market cycles are dynamic. The shift back to Altcoin Season is inevitable at some point, driven by various factors like changing sentiment, institutional flows, or specific altcoin innovations. By staying informed, monitoring key indicators like the Altcoin Season Index , and applying a strategic approach, investors can navigate the current environment and prepare for future shifts in the exciting world of cryptocurrency .

2025-05-28T06:38:53.000Z,"Crypto Czar slammed anti-crypto Senator Warren","Crypto Czar David Sacks slams anti-crypto Senator Elizabeth Warren, saying she, for some reason, has a hatred for the crypto community. He noted that Warren wants to drive the crypto community offshore, and she doesn’t prefer it happening in the U.S. Sacks argued that it was the wrong policy for the U.S. and wanted all the innovation happening in the country. He also acknowledged that crypto is the financial system of the future, and the U.S. has to encourage it. Warren questions Sack’s role in Trump’s administration SHHH DON’T TELL JOE! @DavidSacks just said POCAHONTAS had the AUTOPEN and wasn’t afraid to use it! ✍🏼✍🏼✍🏼 pic.twitter.com/KSUL4WQ4i6 — Jesse Watters (@JesseBWatters) May 28, 2025 Senator Warren has previously called for greater transparency in David Sack’s role as Donald Trump administration’s crypto and artificial intelligence advisor. In a March 6 letter , she urged Sacks to prove that he was not personally profiting from policies that favor select digital currencies, weaken regulatory oversight, and ease enforcement actions against the crypto industry. Warren argued that Americans deserve strong leaders who prioritize the public interest ahead of their bottom lines. She noted in the letter that Sacks had previously stated he offloaded his holdings in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana before taking up his government role. Warren also demanded specific details on the sales and confirmation of when Sack’s investment firm, Craft Ventures, exited its position in Bitwise Investment. Sacks refuted the claims and said he had a $74K position in Bitwise, which he offloaded on January 22. He also confirmed he sold his stake in crypto investment firm Multicoin Capital. The Senator of Massachusetts also requested information on how the Sacks had addressed potential conflicts of interest and how he would prevent the President and other private individuals from directly profiting off the Trump administration’s efforts to pump the value of certain virtual currencies. Warren asked for details on whether Sacks had filed financial disclosures with the Office of Government Ethics. She also requested the specific plans in place at the White House to ensure that individuals developing crypto policy comply with all federal conflict of interest rules. The Senator of Massachusetts has criticized the Securities and Exchange Commission for dropping its legal cases against major crypto companies, including Coinbase, Robinhood, and Kraken. She has also raised concerns over the agency declaring that most memecoins are not securities, which she believes could benefit speculative assets, including Trump’s official token. Warren argued that those actions could benefit billionaire investors, Trump administration insiders, and speculators at the expense of middle-class families. Senator Warren also scrutinized Paul Atkins’ connections to the digital asset industry in late March, accusing Trump’s pick of having financial conflicts. She noted during Atkins’ confirmation hearing before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, arguing there were steps he could take to commit to a higher standard of government ethics. The Massachusetts senator also criticized the stablecoin bill, accusing Trump of using legislation to further his financial interests. She shared the critique while linking a post about President Trump’s decentralized finance project, World Liberty Financial, launching its stablecoin USD1 on Ethereum and Binance’s BNB Chain. Warren wants strong anti-money laundering protections on crypto Senator Warren noted at a U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on May 2 that the national security threat posed by not properly regulating crypto, including the inadvertent funding of rogue nations. She believes that bad players are using digital assets to evade U.S. sanctions without proper anti-money laundering regulations, generating millions of dollars annually by acting as middlemen in the crypto industry. “Anything Congress does to legitimize and grow the crypto market must have strong protections so we do not increase money-making opportunities for Iran and other adversaries.” – Elizabeth Warren , Senator of Massachusetts. The American politician questioned Avril Haines, Director of National Intelligence, about Iran’s ability to avoid sanctions using crypto and how digital assets strengthen American adversaries. Haines argued that Iran is using crypto to move millions of dollars around and also explained that over 50% of North Korean foreign currency revenues now come from crypto. Warren also questioned Lieutenant General Jeffrey Kruse of the U.S. Air Force about the importance of cutting off crypto as a revenue source for foreign adversaries. Kruse argued that Iran having crypto as an additional revenue gives them more discretionary spending power.

2025-05-28T06:30:39.000Z,"Decoding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index: Why 71 in ‘Greed’ Zone Signals Caution","BitcoinWorld Decoding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index: Why 71 in ‘Greed’ Zone Signals Caution Navigating the volatile world of digital assets requires more than just watching charts; understanding the collective mood of the market is crucial. This is where the Crypto Fear and Greed Index comes into play, offering a snapshot of prevailing crypto market sentiment . Understanding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index Provided by Alternative, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a unique tool designed to measure the emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Emotions like fear can lead to impulsive selling, while greed can push investors towards buying sprees, potentially leading to market bubbles. By quantifying these emotions, the index aims to help investors make more informed decisions rather than being swayed purely by sentiment. The index operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Indicates significant undervaluation and potential buying opportunities. 25-49: Fear – Suggests market participants are worried, potentially suppressing prices. 50: Neutral – The market is balanced between fear and greed. 51-74: Greed – Points to increasing optimism and potentially overvalued conditions. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Often signals a market top or bubble, where a correction might be imminent. As of May 28th, the index stands at 71, firmly placing it in the ‘Greed’ zone, although it saw a slight dip of three points from the previous day. This suggests that while optimism remains high, there might be a minor cooling or consolidation occurring. What Factors Influence the Index? The index is not based on a single metric but aggregates data from six key factors, each weighted differently to provide a comprehensive view of cryptocurrency news and sentiment: Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and max drawdown of Bitcoin compared to its average values over the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility driven by price pumps often indicates a greedy market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares the current volume and market momentum (price action) to average values. High buying volume in a positive market suggests greedy or bullish behavior. Social Media (15%): Analyzes specific hashtags and sentiment analysis on platforms like Twitter. High engagement and positive sentiment around certain coins can indicate growing greed. Surveys (15%): Gathers data from weekly sentiment surveys (currently paused). This factor captures direct opinions from market participants. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Rising Bitcoin dominance can sometimes signal fear (as investors move to the perceived safety of BTC) or, conversely, increasing greed (as BTC leads a bull run). Google Trends (10%): Looks at search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Spikes in search terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “Bitcoin bubble” can indicate fear, while terms like “buy Bitcoin” or specific altcoin searches can signal greed. Interpreting ‘Greed’ at 71: What Does it Mean for the Market? A reading of 71 signifies that market participants are generally optimistic and confident. In the context of Bitcoin price and other cryptocurrencies, this level of greed can indicate several things: Bullish Momentum: Prices have likely been trending upwards, fueling positive sentiment. Increased Buying Pressure: More people are willing to buy, potentially even at higher prices, driven by fear of missing out (FOMO). Potential for Correction: Historically, periods of extreme greed have often preceded market pullbacks or corrections. A high reading suggests the market might be getting ahead of itself. The slight drop from 74 to 71 could suggest a minor pause in this upward sentiment, perhaps due to short-term price fluctuations or specific news events. It’s a reminder that sentiment can shift quickly. How Can the Crypto Fear and Greed Index Inform Your Investing Strategy? While the index is a valuable sentiment tool, it should not be the sole basis for your investing strategy . Think of it as a complementary indicator: Contrarian Approach: Some investors use the index contrarianly – buying during extreme fear (when prices are low) and considering selling or reducing positions during extreme greed (when prices are high). A reading of 71 is in the ‘Greed’ zone, suggesting caution might be warranted rather than aggressive buying. Confirmation Tool: Use the index to confirm signals from other analysis methods (e.g., technical analysis, fundamental analysis). If technical indicators suggest a potential pullback and the index shows high greed, it strengthens the case for caution. Risk Management: A high greed score can be a reminder to manage risk, perhaps by taking some profits, setting stop-losses, or avoiding over-leveraging. It’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is influenced by numerous factors, and sentiment is just one piece of the puzzle. Economic news, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and global events all play significant roles. Challenges and Limitations No single indicator is perfect. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has its limitations: Lagging Indicator: Sentiment often follows price action rather than predicting it perfectly. Simplification: It boils down complex market dynamics into a single number. Data Sources: The weighting and specific data sources used by Alternative are proprietary, making it difficult to independently verify its accuracy or anticipate shifts. Not a Crystal Ball: A high greed score doesn’t guarantee a crash, just as extreme fear doesn’t guarantee a bottom. Conclusion: Staying Informed in a Greedy Market The Crypto Fear & Greed Index currently sitting at 71 in the ‘Greed’ zone reflects a market buoyed by optimism and positive momentum. While this can be encouraging for holders, it also serves as a valuable reminder to approach the market with prudence. High levels of greed have historically coincided with periods where market corrections become more likely. By understanding the factors that drive the index and using it in conjunction with other analysis tools, investors can better navigate the emotional tides of the crypto market and refine their investing strategy . Stay informed, stay analytical, and avoid letting pure emotion dictate your decisions.

The Jack Dorsey-founded company revealed the move at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 27, where the new feature was showcased at the BTC Inc. merchandise store. The rollout is expected to begin in the second half of 2025, with full availability anticipated in 2026 for all eligible Square sellers, pending regulatory approvals. The feature will allow merchants using Square hardware to accept Bitcoin payments via the Lightning Network, Bitcoin’s layer-2 protocol designed for faster and lower-cost micro transactions. Customers will be able to pay by scanning a QR code, while Square’s backend handles the real-time exchange rate calculation and confirmation, enabling near-instant settlement. Merchants can choose to receive Bitcoin directly or convert it into fiat currency automatically at the point of sale. The update builds on Square’s earlier Bitcoin Conversion tool, introduced in 2024, which gave merchants the option to allocate a portion of their daily sales to Bitcoin without manual intervention. As of April 2025, Square reportedly serves nearly 4 million merchants, making it the leading U.S. merchant acquirer by number of sellers. You might also like: Jack Dorsey’s Block to pay $40m over compliance failures on Cash App According to Miles Suter, Bitcoin Product Lead at Block, the new capability marks a major step toward fulfilling Bitcoin’s original purpose as a peer-to-peer payment system. “Rolling out a native bitcoin experience to millions of sellers brings us one step closer to that goal,” Suter said, adding that the goal is to provide faster payments and greater revenue control for small businesses. “We believe in an open, decentralized, fair, fast, and low-cost money system for everyone, and that’s exactly what we want to bring to Square sellers,” Suter added. Bitcoin payments on Square mark a strategic extension of Block’s broader push to embed Bitcoin into everyday finance, complementing its self-custody wallet Bitkey, its decentralised mining venture Proto, open-source development arm Spiral, and Cash App’s growing role in retail Bitcoin adoption. The launch of Bitcoin payments comes after earlier remarks by CEO Jack Dorsey, who in April said that Bitcoin risked becoming irrelevant if it failed to transition from a store of value to a functional payment method. At the time, Dorsey confirmed the company was actively working on enabling Bitcoin payments through Square and Bitkey . The launch of Bitcoin payments on Square follows a challenging period for Block. In early 2024, the company laid off approximately 1,000 employees, and in March, it cut an additional 931 jobs following weaker-than-expected earnings for Q4 2023.

Sacks told Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss during a May 27 fireside chat at the Bitcoin 2025 conference that while he “can’t promise anything,” a pathway does exist for the government to buy more Bitcoin ( BTC ). However, it would require convincing Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick or Treasury Secretary Scott Besson to OK the buy and fund it “without a new tax or adding to the debt,” Sacks said, adding that “maybe by finding the money from some other program that’s not using it — then we could potentially acquire more Bitcoin.” David Sacks said the US could buy more Bitcoin, but he can’t make any promises.

2025-05-28T06:20:36.000Z,"Bitcoin Potential: BlackRock Exec Reveals BTC Could Skyrocket Past Gold","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Potential: BlackRock Exec Reveals BTC Could Skyrocket Past Gold In the ever-evolving landscape of finance, where traditional assets meet digital innovation, comments from major players carry significant weight. A recent statement from a top executive at BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, has reignited discussions about the future trajectory of digital assets, specifically focusing on Bitcoin potential compared to traditional safe havens like gold. This isn’t just another opinion; it’s a perspective from within the walls of an institution increasingly involved in the crypto space. What Did the BlackRock Exec Really Say About BlackRock Bitcoin? At the Bitcoin Conference 2025 in Las Vegas, Robert Mitchnick, Managing Director at BlackRock, shared a view that has resonated throughout the crypto community. According to a report by Bitcoin Magazine on X, Mitchnick stated unequivocally that “Bitcoin has much higher upside than gold.” This simple yet powerful assertion from a representative of a firm that recently launched one of the most successful spot Bitcoin ETFs (IBIT) underscores a notable shift in how traditional finance views the premier cryptocurrency. Why is this particular statement significant? BlackRock manages trillions of dollars in assets. Their strategic decisions and public commentary often signal broader trends in institutional investment. Mitchnick’s role as a Managing Director suggests he is involved in key areas, likely including the firm’s digital asset initiatives. Therefore, his comparison isn’t merely speculative; it’s likely informed by internal analysis and market perspective from a firm deeply engaged with both traditional and digital asset classes. For years, gold has been the go-to asset for investors seeking a store of value and a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Bitcoin emerged with a similar narrative, often dubbed “digital gold.” The debate about which asset serves this purpose better, and more importantly, which offers greater growth prospects, has been central to crypto discussions. Mitchnick’s comment directly addresses the growth potential, favoring Bitcoin. Why is the “Bitcoin vs Gold” Debate Heating Up? The comparison between Bitcoin vs Gold is fundamental to understanding Bitcoin’s investment thesis, especially for traditional investors. Both assets are viewed as scarce, decentralized stores of value outside the direct control of governments or central banks. However, their characteristics and market dynamics differ significantly, leading to varying perspectives on their future performance. Let’s look at some key points of comparison: Scarcity and Supply: Gold supply increases slowly through mining, with no absolute cap known. Bitcoin has a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, enforced by its protocol. This verifiable, absolute scarcity is a core argument for its long-term value potential. Divisibility and Portability: Bitcoin is highly divisible (down to 8 decimal places, called satoshis) and instantly portable across the globe with minimal cost (relatively, depending on network conditions). Gold is less divisible and costly to transport and store securely. Verifiability: The authenticity of Bitcoin can be cryptographically verified on the blockchain. Verifying gold often requires physical inspection and expertise. Market Size and Liquidity: The gold market is vastly larger and more mature than the Bitcoin market. However, Bitcoin’s market depth and liquidity have grown dramatically, particularly with the advent of spot ETFs. Volatility: Historically, Bitcoin has been far more volatile than gold. This volatility presents both higher risk and potentially higher reward, contributing to the “higher upside” argument. Institutional Adoption: While institutions have held gold for centuries, their adoption of Bitcoin is a relatively new but accelerating trend. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. is a prime example of increasing institutional access and interest. Here’s a simplified comparison table: Feature Bitcoin (BTC) Gold (XAU) Supply Cap Fixed (21 million) No fixed cap (mined) Nature Digital Physical Divisibility Highly divisible (Satoshi) Less divisible Portability Easy, Global Difficult, Costly Verification Cryptographic (Blockchain) Physical inspection Volatility High Low to Moderate Institutional Adoption Growing Rapidly Established Mitchnick’s comment suggests that despite gold’s long history, the unique digital properties and market dynamics of Bitcoin position it for potentially greater future appreciation, largely because it is starting from a smaller base and benefits from network effects and increasing digital integration. Exploring Bitcoin’s Potential: Is Skyrocketing Price Growth Possible? The idea of significant Bitcoin price potential is central to the investment thesis for many holders. Several factors contribute to the belief that Bitcoin’s price could see substantial future growth, perhaps even dwarfing gold’s historical returns. Supply Halvings: Approximately every four years, the rate at which new Bitcoin enters circulation is cut in half. This programmed supply shock, while demand either remains constant or increases, has historically preceded significant price rallies. Increasing Demand: Demand is growing from multiple fronts – individual retail investors, corporations adding BTC to their balance sheets, and perhaps most significantly, large financial institutions offering Bitcoin products or investing directly. Institutionalization: The launch of easy-to-access investment vehicles like spot Bitcoin ETFs opens the door for a massive pool of capital that was previously hesitant or unable to invest in Bitcoin directly. This influx of institutional money is a powerful potential catalyst. Macroeconomic Landscape: In an era of potential inflation, currency devaluation, and economic uncertainty, the narrative of Bitcoin as a scarce, decentralized store of value becomes more appealing to a wider audience. Network Effects: As more users, developers, and businesses adopt Bitcoin, its utility and value as a network increase, creating a positive feedback loop. Comparing this to gold, gold’s price movements are typically more tied to inflation fears, currency strength, and jewelry/industrial demand. While it serves its purpose as a stable store of value, the structural factors driving potential exponential growth in Bitcoin (like halvings and rapid technological adoption) are simply not present in the gold market. Mitchnick’s perspective aligns with the view that Bitcoin, being a younger, more dynamic asset class with unique supply dynamics and growing global digital adoption, has a longer runway for appreciation than the established, mature gold market. The percentage growth required for Bitcoin to reach a market capitalization comparable to gold’s is significantly higher, implying substantial price increases per coin if that convergence were to occur. How is Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Shaping the Market? The trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption is arguably the most significant development in the crypto space over the past few years. What started with a few pioneering corporate treasuries has expanded dramatically, bringing legitimacy, liquidity, and new capital into the market. BlackRock itself is a prime example. Their iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) quickly became one of the most successful ETF launches in history by assets under management. This wasn’t just about offering a product; it represented BlackRock putting its significant weight and reputation behind making Bitcoin accessible to a vast network of financial advisors and their clients. Beyond ETFs, institutions are engaging in various ways: Direct Investment: Some corporations and investment funds are holding Bitcoin directly on their balance sheets. Custody Solutions: The development of robust, regulated custody solutions has made it safer and more feasible for institutions to hold significant amounts of Bitcoin. Derivatives Markets: Growth in Bitcoin futures and options markets provides institutions with tools for hedging and speculation. Lending and Borrowing: Institutional-grade platforms for Bitcoin lending and borrowing are emerging. Venture Capital: Significant VC funding continues to pour into companies building infrastructure and services in the crypto space. The impact of this institutional embrace is multifaceted. It increases market liquidity, potentially reduces long-term volatility (as institutional holders tend to be long-term players), builds credibility for the asset class, and integrates Bitcoin further into the global financial system. When executives from firms like BlackRock speak positively about Bitcoin, it reinforces this trend and can influence other institutions and traditional investors. What Does This Mean for the Overall Crypto Market Outlook? The positive commentary from a BlackRock executive about Bitcoin’s potential has broader implications for the entire crypto market outlook . Bitcoin often acts as the gateway asset for institutions and new investors entering the space. Increased confidence and investment in Bitcoin can have a halo effect on other cryptocurrencies and the broader digital asset ecosystem. A positive outlook for Bitcoin suggests continued interest in the underlying technology (blockchain) and other digital assets. It validates the idea that digital assets are evolving from a niche interest to a recognized asset class with a place in diversified portfolios. However, the crypto market outlook is not without its challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies remains fragmented and uncertain across different jurisdictions. Clarity is needed for broader institutional comfort. Market Volatility: While institutional money might temper volatility over time, the crypto market is known for sharp price swings driven by sentiment, news, and macroeconomic factors. Technological Risks: While Bitcoin’s protocol has proven robust, risks related to exchanges, custody providers, or potential future technological shifts exist. Global Economic Factors: The performance of crypto assets can be influenced by interest rates, inflation, and global economic stability, just like traditional assets. Despite these challenges, the increasing institutional validation, highlighted by comments like Mitchnick’s, points towards a future where digital assets play a more prominent role in global finance. The focus remains heavily on Bitcoin as the leading institutional-grade asset, but the infrastructure and understanding built around it benefit the wider market. Weighing the Benefits and Challenges of Bitcoin Investment Investing in Bitcoin, especially with the perspective of its high growth potential compared to assets like gold, comes with a unique set of benefits and challenges. It’s crucial for any potential investor to understand both sides. Benefits: High Growth Potential: As highlighted by the BlackRock executive, the potential for significant price appreciation due to limited supply, increasing demand, and network effects is a major draw. Decentralization: Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network, meaning it is not controlled by any single entity, offering a degree of autonomy from traditional financial systems. Store of Value: Its fixed supply and resistance to inflation make it an attractive potential store of value, particularly in uncertain economic times. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin can be sent and received anywhere in the world with an internet connection, offering financial inclusion and ease of transfer. Transparency: All Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger (the blockchain), providing a level of transparency not found in traditional finance. Challenges: Extreme Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings in short periods, leading to significant risk of loss. Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of clear, consistent regulation globally creates legal and operational risks. Security Risks: While the network is secure, individual investors face risks from exchange hacks, phishing scams, and losing private keys. Complexity: Understanding the technology, market dynamics, and secure storage methods can be challenging for newcomers. Market Manipulation: Although decreasing with institutional involvement, the market can still be susceptible to manipulation. The decision to invest should weigh the potential for high returns against these considerable risks. The perspective from BlackRock emphasizes the upside, but prudent investors must consider the full picture. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Bitcoin Landscape Given the evolving landscape and the insights from major financial players, what steps can individuals take? Educate Yourself: Understand how Bitcoin works, its history, market cycles, and the technology behind it. Don’t rely solely on headlines or single opinions. Define Your Goals and Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin is not suitable for everyone. Assess if its volatility and long-term potential align with your personal financial goals and comfort level with risk. Start Small: If you decide to invest, consider starting with a small amount you are comfortable losing. Consider Your Investment Method: Decide whether direct ownership (managing your own keys) or using regulated products like ETFs (offering convenience and familiar structures) is better suited for you. Prioritize Security: If holding Bitcoin directly, learn about and use secure storage solutions like hardware wallets. Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication on exchanges. Stay Informed: Follow reliable news sources and analysis on the crypto market, regulatory developments, and technological advancements. Think Long-Term: Many investors view Bitcoin as a long-term asset. Short-term price swings can be significant, but the long-term trend has historically been upward. Comments from figures like Robert Mitchnick provide valuable context from the institutional world, but individual research and a clear strategy are paramount. Conclusion Robert Mitchnick’s statement that Bitcoin offers greater price growth potential than gold is a powerful indicator of how perspectives on digital assets are shifting within traditional finance. Coming from a leader at BlackRock, a firm deeply embedded in both traditional markets and increasingly in the crypto space, the comment underscores a growing institutional belief in Bitcoin’s future. The debate between Bitcoin vs Gold as a store of value continues, but the focus is clearly moving towards which asset offers superior potential returns in the digital age. Bitcoin’s unique characteristics—fixed supply, digital nature, growing institutional adoption, and dynamic market cycles—position it differently from the mature gold market. While the path forward for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market outlook involves navigating significant volatility and regulatory hurdles, the increasing validation from major financial institutions suggests that digital assets are here to stay and are being seriously considered for their long-term growth prospects. Investors should view such comments as valuable insights, but always couple them with thorough personal research and a clear understanding of the inherent risks involved in this exciting, yet unpredictable, market.

Guo will face the court on “allegations relating to multiple breaches of his directors’ duties,” the Australian Securities and Investments Commission said in a May 28 press release. ASIC alleged Guo made multiple breaches of directors’ duties relating to his dealings with ACX Exchange customer funds, and claimed he made false and misleading statements about those dealings and failed to maintain proper books and records. The now-liquidated Blockchain Global operated the ACX Exchange from mid-2016 until December 2019, when it collapsed as customers could no longer withdraw their assets. During liquidator’s examinations in 2022, the courts were told that ACX exchange took the cash invested by its customers to buy crypto and mingled the funds into one pooled fund, the Sydney Morning Herald reported at the time. The liquidators of Blockchain Global estimate that the company owed over 20 million Australian dollars ($12.8 million) in unsecured creditor claims to former customers of the ACX Exchange, ASIC said. In November 2023, liquidators reported that Blockchain Global had 58.6 million Australian dollars ($37.7 million) owed to unsecured creditors. Of that total, 22.7 million Australian dollars ($14.6 million) were unsecured creditor claims received from former customers of the crypto exchange .

Five commissioners are supposed to make up the CFTC, and no more than three can be from the same political party.Goldsmith Romero said that during her tenure, all the commissioners had different perspectives and experiences that, when brought together, were “really helpful.”“So what happens if the CFTC gets down to one and gets new authority for crypto? It’s going to be really, really hard; you’re not going to have the same push and pull,” she said.The Trump administration has floated the idea of handing the reins of crypto regulation to the CFTC in the past. Congressional Republicans have also been drafting bills to give the CFTC greater oversight over the industry, Retail customer Definition should be CFTC priority In the future, Goldsmith Romero thinks the CFTC should work on defining a retail customer to ensure the influx of fresh investments in “crypto and some other products” has a similar retail customer protection regime to the Securities and Exchange Commission.Related: Crypto perp futures coming ‘very soon,’ says CFTC’s Mersinger“I came from the SEC with an investor protection regime, you want people to know their rights and risk if they take a risk and they lose that’s on them,” she said.“But you want to have some basic things like exchanges that are registered that have some basic requirements and have to follow the law and this is, I think, the main thing that needs to happen.”Goldsmith Romero said other “extremely basic” rules could include a ban against co-mingling a company’s assets with customer funds, and brokers, exchanges and clearing houses being required to register with the SEC, the CFTC or in some cases, both.Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/goldsmith-romero-cf-exodus-not-a-great-situation?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-28T02:11:48.000Z,"Real-world assets could revitalize dying NFT lending market: DappRadar","Real-world assets linking up with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is one of a few key catalysts that could reignite the waning NFT lending sector, which is suffering from a collapse in volumes and user activity, says blockchain analytics platform DappRadar.Volumes in the NFT lending market, which allows NFT holders to take out a loan against their token, have dropped 97% from a peak of around $1 billion in January 2024 to $50 million in May, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a May 27 report.Gherghelas said for NFT lending to “move beyond survival mode,” it needs “new catalysts” to reignite the sector, such as real-world asset NFTs, like tokenized real estate or yield-bearing assets that could unlock more stable, trusted collateral sources.“So far, 2025 has not delivered a compelling reason for NFT lending to bounce back,” she said. “While the infrastructure is still here and the platforms remain active, activity has slowed across the board.” Borrower and leading activity have taken a big hit in the NFT lending sector. Source: DappRadar“For now, the sector seems to be in a holding pattern, waiting either for market recovery or a new use case to reignite interest.”Gherghelas added that other catalysts that could rekindle NFT lending were tools that make it easier for NFT holders to borrow against their tokens, and that protocols should create “smart infrastructure” such as undercollateralized loans, credit scores and artificial intelligence risk matching.The report adds that since January last year, borrower activity has declined by 90% and those willing to lend have shrunk by 78%.The average NFT loan size has also taken a hit from a peak of $22,000 in 2022 to $4,000 in May, a 71% year-over-year drop.Gherghelas said this shift “shows that either users are borrowing against lower-value assets or simply becoming more conservative with leverage.”NFT lending overall trading volume and market activity have dropped off from the all-time highs of past years. Source: DappRadarThe average loan duration is also lower; after hitting an average of roughly 40 days in 2023, it’s been down to 31 days and has held steady throughout 2024 and into 2025.Gherghelas said this could indicate that “loans are being taken more frequently but for shorter periods, perhaps a sign of more tactical liquidity plays.”NFT ﻿market downturn also hurts lendingPart of the slowdown in NFT lending is connected to the overall NFT market decline, which has seen volumes drop 61% in the first quarter to $1.5 billion compared to $4.1 billion a year ago.“With collateral value collapsing, the lending activity naturally followed,” Gherghelas said. “There are a few exceptions that managed to hold or regain traction, but they’ve been outliers, not enough to lift the sector.”Related: AI decentralized apps are coming for the Web3 throne: DappRadarThe protocol landscape has also narrowed, and the number of active NFT lending apps is limited, with only eight protocols holding any meaningful share.“The flip-for-liquidity model that worked during bull markets isn’t built for a quieter, more risk-averse environment. But that doesn’t mean NFT lending is finished; it’s simply shifting focus,” Gherghelas said.“Platforms are diversifying, use cases are shifting, and collateral preferences are changing. If the next wave builds on utility, culture, and better design, NFT lending might just find its second wind — one built to last.”Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-world-assets-revitalize-dying-nft-lending-dappradar?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

SharpLink will invest $425 million to acquire 120,000 ETH. Ethereum futures open interest hits an all-time high of $36.1 billion, with ETH price climbing 4.5% on the daily chart. Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming (SBET) announced a $425 million private investment in public equity (PIPE), acquiring approximately 69.1 million shares at $6.15 each to establish the first Nasdaq-listed Ethereum (ETH) treasury company.Spearheaded by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, this move mirrors Strategy’s (MSTR) successful Bitcoin treasury strategy, which has yielded over $8.2 billion in gains in 2025, by leveraging stock and bond sales to acquire BTC.Former Ethereum core developer and contributor Eric Conner highlighted the bullish implications of SharpLink’s move, noting its potential to create a “public ETH proxy for funds that can’t hold tokens directly.” Conner emphasized that the acquisition of 120,000 ETH—likely to be staked—could lead to “supply compression” by removing tokens from circulation. The Ether proponent also pointed to the “new narrative fuel” this provides, positioning ETH as a “digital reserve collateral” and potentially driving its adoption on mainstream balance sheets through an equity wrapper like $SBET.However, crypto analyst VICTOR cautioned against over-enthusiasm, outlining the risk of leveraging gains from an altcoin still down 19% in 2025. In Q1 2025, Cointelegraph reported a sharp decline in Ethereum network fees, dropping to $605,000 from $2.5 million in just two weeks in March, alongside a noticeable decrease in decentralized app (DApp) activity.

The majority of these rallies—eight out of ten—resulted in negative returns, while one rally triggered a short squeeze, driving prices higher, and another displayed neutral price action.From a technical perspective, Ether’s price action on the daily chart posted a descending triangle, a bullish breakout pattern, which creates equal highs and higher lows, converging toward an imminent rally. The pattern is bordered by two trendlines, the upper resistance, currently around $2,700 and the ascending support line. A bullish breakout above $2,677 targets the pattern’s measured move, calculated by adding the triangle’s height to the breakout point.

Speaking at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, Sigel said the most viable path forward may involve inserting Bitcoin mining incentives into the congressional budget reconciliation process.According to Sigel, the most effective path to growing a US strategic Bitcoin reserve would be through targeted amendments to congressional budget legislation. These could include tax credits for mining companies that use methane gas and other incentives aimed at encouraging miners to share a portion of their mined BTC with the federal government. He argued that such an approach would allow the reserve to grow organically over time. Sigel also highlighted the limitations of executive actions in achieving this goal:\""The problem with executive action is that it's going to prompt lawsuits.

At the time, the company said Anchorage Digital and Copper would serve as custodians and collateral managers in the venture.Credit markets are a fundamental part of the financial system, allowing capital to flow between borrowers and lenders and supporting economic activity across sectors.

Bitcoin’s bullish momentum aligns with the favorable US financial conditions, as noted by Ecoinometrics. The macroeconomic-focused Bitcoin newsletter highlighted that the National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) shows a rapid shift to ultra-loose territory after a tightening phase in February 2025. The NFCI, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, tracks stress in the financial system by aggregating measures like credit spreads, leverage, and funding conditions. When the index moves into looser territory, it reflects easier access to capital and reduced market stress—conditions that typically encourage risk-taking behavior among investors. For high-beta assets like Bitcoin, such periods often coincide with price rallies as capital flows into speculative markets.US National Financial Conditions Index.

It’s tracking the same pattern we saw since 2023: easing conditions → capital rotation → risk-on.”With Bitcoin just 2% away from its all-time high price, data from CoinGlass indicates that the probability of a short-squeeze remains high due to significant sell-side liquidity.

2025-05-27T15:40:00.000Z,"93% of all Bitcoin is already mined. Here’s what that means","How much Bitcoin is left to mine?              Bitcoin’s total supply is hardcoded at 21 million BTC, a fixed upper limit that cannot be altered without a consensus-breaking change to the protocol. This finite cap is enforced at the protocol level and is central to Bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset.As of May 2025, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoin (BTC) have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created, and those remaining coins will be mined very slowly.The reason for this uneven distribution is Bitcoin’s exponential issuance schedule, governed by an event called the halving. When Bitcoin launched in 2009, the block reward was 50 BTC. Every 210,000 blocks — or approximately every four years — that reward is cut in half. Because the early rewards were so large, over 87% of the total supply was mined by the end of 2020. Each subsequent halving sharply reduces the rate of new issuance, meaning it will take over a century to mine the remaining 6.7%.According to current estimates, 99% of all Bitcoin will have been mined by 2035, but the final fraction — the last satoshis — won’t be produced until around the year 2140 due to the nature of geometric reward reduction.This engineered scarcity, combined with an immutable supply cap, is what draws comparisons between Bitcoin and physical commodities like gold. But Bitcoin is even more predictable: Gold’s supply grows at around 1.7% annually, whereas Bitcoin’s issuance rate is transparently declining.Did you know? Bitcoin’s supply curve is not terminal in the traditional sense. It follows an asymptotic trajectory — a kind of economic Zeno’s paradox — where rewards diminish indefinitely but never truly reach zero. Mining will continue until around 2140, by which point over 99.999% of the total 21 million BTC will have been issued.                  Beyond the supply cap: How lost coins make Bitcoin scarcer than you think              While over 93% of Bitcoin’s total supply has been mined, that doesn’t mean it’s all available. A significant portion is permanently out of circulation, lost due to forgotten passwords, misplaced wallets, destroyed hard drives or early adopters who never touched their coins again.Estimates from firms like Chainalysis and Glassnode suggest that between 3.0 million and 3.8 million BTC — roughly 14%-18% of the total supply — is likely gone for good. That includes high-profile dormant addresses like the one believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, which alone holds over 1.1 million BTC.This means Bitcoin’s true circulating supply may be closer to 16 million-17 million, not 21 million. And because Bitcoin is non-recoverable by design, any lost coins stay lost — permanently reducing supply over time.Now compare that to gold. Around 85% of the world’s total gold supply has been mined — approximately 216,265 metric tons, according to the World Gold Council — but nearly all of it remains in circulation or held in vaults, jewelry, ETFs and central banks. Gold can be remelted and reused; Bitcoin cannot be resurrected once access is lost.This distinction gives Bitcoin a kind of hardening scarcity, a supply that not only stops growing over time but quietly shrinks.As Bitcoin matures, it’s entering a monetary phase similar to gold: low issuance, high holder concentration and increasing demand-side sensitivity. But Bitcoin takes it further; its supply cap is hard, its loss rate is permanent, and its distribution is publicly auditable.This may lead to several outcomes:Increased price volatility as available supply becomes more limited and sensitive to market demandHigher long-term value concentration in the hands of those who remain active and secure in their key managementA premium on liquidity, where actually spendable BTC trades at a higher effective value than dormant supply.In extreme cases, this could produce a bifurcation between “circulating BTC” and “unreachable BTC,” with the former gaining greater economic significance, particularly in times of constrained exchange liquidity or macroeconomic stress.                  What happens when Bitcoin is fully mined?              There’s a popular assumption that as Bitcoin’s block rewards shrink, the network’s security will eventually suffer. But in practice, the mining economy is far more adaptive — and much more resilient — than that.Bitcoin’s mining incentives are governed by a self-correcting feedback loop: If mining becomes unprofitable, miners drop off the network, which in turn triggers a difficulty adjustment. Every 2,016 blocks (roughly every two weeks), the network recalibrates mining difficulty using a parameter known as nBits. The goal is to keep block times steady at around 10 minutes, regardless of how many miners are competing.So, if Bitcoin’s price drops, or the reward becomes too small relative to operating costs, inefficient miners simply exit. This causes difficulty to fall, lowering the cost for those who remain. The result is a system that continually rebalances itself, aligning network participation with available incentives.This mechanism has already been tested at scale. After China banned mining in mid-2021, Bitcoin’s global hashrate dropped by more than 50% in a matter of weeks. Yet the network continued to function without interruption, and within a few months, the hashrate fully recovered, as miners resumed operations in jurisdictions with lower energy costs and more favorable regulations.Critically, the idea that lower rewards will inherently threaten network security overlooks how mining is tied to profit margins, not nominal BTC amounts. As long as the market price supports the cost of hash power — even at 0.78125 BTC per block (post-2028 halving) or lower — miners will continue to secure the network.In other words, it’s not the absolute reward that matters, but whether mining remains profitable relative to costs. And thanks to Bitcoin’s built-in difficulty adjustment, it usually does.Even a century from now, when the block reward approaches zero, the network will likely still be protected by whatever combination of fees, base incentives and infrastructure efficiency exists at that time. But that’s a distant concern. In the meantime, the current system — hashrate adjusts, difficulty rebalances, miners adapt — remains one of the most robust elements of Bitcoin’s design.Did you know? On April 20, 2024, following the launch of the Runes protocol, Bitcoin miners earned over $80 million in transaction fees within a single day, surpassing the $26 million earned from block rewards. This marked the first time in Bitcoin’s history that transaction fees alone exceeded the block subsidy in daily miner revenue.                  The future of Bitcoin mining: Energy consumption              It’s a common misconception that rising Bitcoin prices will drive endless energy use. In reality, mining is constrained by profitability, not price alone.As block rewards shrink, miners are pushed toward thinner margins, and that means chasing the cheapest, cleanest energy available. Since China’s 2021 mining ban, hashrate has migrated to regions like North America and Northern Europe, where operators tap into surplus hydro, wind and underutilized grid energy.According to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, between 52% and 59% of Bitcoin mining now runs on renewables or low-emission sources. Regulations are reinforcing this trend, with several jurisdictions offering incentives for clean-powered mining or penalizing fossil-fuel operations.Moreover, the idea that higher BTC prices will always mean higher energy use misses how Bitcoin self-regulates: More miners raise difficulty, which compresses margins, capping energy expansion. Renewable-based mining brings its own challenges, but the dystopian future of endlessly expanding fossil-fueled hash power is increasingly unlikely.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/93-of-all-bitcoin-is-already-mined-heres-what-that-means?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T15:00:00.000Z,"ZKPs can prove I&#039;m old enough without telling you my age","Opinion by: Andre Omietanski, General Counsel, and Amal Ibraymi, Legal Counsel at Aztec LabsWhat if you could prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthday, name, or anything else at all? Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) make this hypothetical a reality and solve one of the key challenges online: verifying age without sacrificing privacy. The need for better age verification todayWe're witnessing an uptick in laws being proposed restricting minors' access to social media and the internet, including in Australia, Florida, and China. To protect minors from inappropriate adult content, platform owners and governments often walk a tightrope between inaction and overreach. For example, the state of Louisiana in the US recently enacted a law meant to block minors from viewing porn. Sites required users to upload an ID before viewing content. The Free Speech Coalition challenged the law as unconstitutional, making the case that it infringed on First Amendment rights. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed on procedural grounds. The reaction, however, highlights the dilemma facing policymakers and platforms: how to block minors without violating adults' rights or creating new privacy risks.Traditional age verification failsCurrent age verification tools are either ineffective or invasive. Self-declaration is meaningless, since users can simply lie about their age. ID-based verification is overly invasive. No one should be required to upload their most sensitive documents, putting themselves at risk of data breaches and identity theft. Biometric solutions like fingerprints and face scans are convenient for users but raise important ethical, privacy, and security concerns. Biometric systems are not always accurate and may generate false positives and negatives. The irreversible nature of the data, which can't be changed like a regular password can, is also less than ideal. Other methods, like behavioral tracking and AI-driven verification of browser patterns, are also problematic, using machine learning to analyze user interactions and identify patterns and anomalies, raising concerns of a surveillance culture.ZKPs as the privacy-preserving solutionZero-knowledge proofs present a compelling solution. Like a government ID provider, a trusted entity verifies the user's age and generates a cryptographic proof confirming they are over the required age. Websites only need to check the proof, not the excess personal data, ensuring privacy while keeping minors at the gates. No centralized data storage is required, alleviating the burden on platforms such as Google, Meta, and WhatsApp and eliminating the risk of data breaches. Recent: How zero-knowledge proofs can make AI fairerAdopting and enforcing ZKPs at scaleZKPs aren't a silver bullet. They can be complex to implement. The notion of \""don't trust, verify,\"" proven by indisputable mathematics, may cause some regulatory skepticism. Policymakers may hesitate to trust cryptographic proofs over visible ID verification. There are occasions when companies may need to disclose personal information to authorities, such as during an investigation into financial crimes or government inquiries. This would challenge ZKPs, whose very intention is for platforms not to hold this data in the first place.ZKPs also struggle with scalability and performance, being somewhat computationally intensive and tricky to program. Efficient implementation techniques are being explored, and breakthroughs, such as the Noir programming language, are making ZKPs more accessible to developers, driving the adoption of secure, privacy-first solutions. A safer, smarter future for age verificationGoogle's move to adopt ZKPs for age verification is a promising signal that mainstream platforms are beginning to embrace privacy-preserving technologies. But to fully realize the potential of ZKPs, we need more than isolated solutions locked into proprietary ecosystems. Crypto-native wallets can go further. Open-source and permissionless blockchain-based systems offer interoperability, composability, and programmable identity. With a single proof, users can access a range of services across the open web — no need to start from scratch every time, or trust a single provider (Google) with their credentials.ZKPs flip the script on online identity — proving what matters, without exposing anything else. They protect user privacy, help platforms stay compliant, and block minors from restricted content, all without creating new honeypots of sensitive data.Google's adoption of ZKPs shows mainstream momentum is building. But to truly transform digital identity, we must embrace crypto-native, decentralized systems that give users control over what they share and who they are online.In an era defined by surveillance, ZKPs offer a better path forward — one that's secure, private, and built for the future.Opinion by: Andre Omietanski, General Counsel, and Amal Ibraymi, Legal Counsel at Aztec Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-27T14:30:00.000Z,"What is a cryptocurrency mixer and how does it work?","Cryptocurrency mixers explained              A cryptocurrency mixer is a specialized service designed to increase the privacy and anonymity of blockchain transactions. Unlike traditional financial transactions, which are private by default, most cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) operate on public blockchains. This means every transaction is permanently recorded and accessible to anyone, making it possible for blockchain analysts or malicious actors to trace the flow of funds between wallets.A crypto mixer’s primary function is to break the link between the sender’s wallet and the recipient’s wallet. It does so by pooling together coins from many users and then redistributing them in a way that makes it difficult to track which coins went where. Think of it like a digital version of shuffling cards in a deck. After mixing, your cryptocurrency is returned to you or a recipient’s address, but it’s “cleaned” of any direct transaction history.This privacy-enhancing feature is why some people rely on mixers, especially those seeking to keep their financial activities confidential in an open-ledger world.                  How does a crypto mixer work?              To understand a crypto mixer, it’s useful to compare it to the concept of money laundering in traditional finance, albeit with legal and ethical nuances. The process of “mixing” is essentially designed to obscure the origin and destination of coins.Here’s a typical workflow of how a cryptocurrency mixer operates:Deposit: You send your cryptocurrency to the mixer’s wallet address. Multiple users do the same, creating a large pool of coins.Mixing/shuffling: The mixer’s system pools and shuffles these coins together, breaking any visible connection between deposited and withdrawn funds.Redistribution: After mixing, the service sends back an equivalent amount of coins to your specified address, but these aren’t the same coins you deposited. They come from the pooled coins of all participants.Fees: The mixer usually deducts a small fee, generally ranging from 1% to 3%, to cover operational costs.This process effectively disrupts blockchain analysis, making it extremely difficult for anyone to trace the coins back to their original owners.                  Types of cryptocurrency mixers              Not all mixers are created equal. They can broadly be divided into two categories: centralized and decentralized mixers.Centralized mixersCentralized mixers are the most common and operate similarly to traditional services. You send your coins to a company or entity that controls the mixing process, and then they send back “clean” coins after mixing. These services are relatively easy to use, often providing a simple user interface.However, centralized mixers require you to trust the service operator with your coins, at least temporarily. This introduces risks such as:The mixer could be a scam and disappear with your funds.It could be hacked, exposing users’ data and coins.The operator may keep logs that could compromise your privacy.Decentralized mixersDecentralized mixers use blockchain technology and smart contracts to automate the mixing process without a trusted third party. They rely on cryptographic methods such as zero-knowledge proofs to mix coins in a trustless environment. Users pool their coins into a smart contract, which then redistributes coins in a way that ensures privacy.Advantages of decentralized mixers include:No central point of failure or custody risk.Higher privacy because no single party controls the funds.Often more resistant to regulatory crackdowns.Did you know? The DOJ indicted four Russians for operating crypto mixers Blender.io and Sinbad.io, yet failed to show they knowingly laundered illicit funds. The indictment relies heavily on vague forum posts and lacks concrete evidence of criminal intent or ties to US commerce, raising serious doubts about its strength in court.                  Real-world cases involving mixers and scams              Unfortunately, the privacy offered by crypto mixers has also attracted criminals. The very anonymity that protects innocent users can also shield illicit activities, leading to widespread misuse.Crypto mixers have been linked to ransomware attacks, dark web marketplaces, fraud and drug trafficking. Criminals often use these services to “clean” proceeds from illegal transactions and hide their tracks from law enforcement.A notable example is ChipMixer, a service seized by Europol in 2023 for allegedly facilitating money laundering for dark web markets and ransomware groups. Authorities dismantled the platform’s infrastructure over alleged money laundering, seizing four servers, 1,909.4 BTC (about $210 million as of May 26, 2025) and seven TB of data across 55 transactions.Mixers have also been involved in laundering stolen funds from cryptocurrency exchange hacks. The complexity of these transactions makes it difficult for investigators to recover stolen assets.In February 2025, Bybit, a major cryptocurrency exchange, suffered a significant security breach resulting in the theft of about $1.5 billion worth of cryptocurrencies. The attackers, attributed to the Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking organization, employed various crypto mixers, including Wasabi, CryptoMixer, Railgun and Tornado Cash, to launder portions of the stolen assets. Despite efforts to trace the funds, a significant portion remains unaccounted for, highlighting the challenges posed by mixers in cybersecurity investigations.                  Are crypto mixers legal?              The legal status of cryptocurrency mixers depends largely on the jurisdiction and context of their use.Most governments impose strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing regulations on financial services, including digital currency services. Mixers, by their nature, complicate AML compliance because they obscure transaction trails.For instance,In the European Union, the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD) includes digital currency providers under its regulatory scope, requiring them to perform KYC checks and report suspicious activity.In the United States, FinCEN classifies cryptocurrency mixers as money transmitters, requiring registration and compliance with AML regulations. Unlicensed mixers can face severe penalties and criminal charges.Legal uses vs misuseUsing a mixer for privacy reasons is not inherently illegal. However, if mixers are used to launder proceeds from crimes, authorities will prosecute offenders. Similarly, operating a mixer without appropriate licenses or regulatory oversight can be illegal.If you choose to use a mixer, make sure you understand the legal implications in your country and avoid any activity that could be linked to money laundering or fraud.Did you know? Crypto mixer transactions are still taxable. Using a mixer doesn’t hide gains from tax authorities; failing to report them can trigger audits or penalties. Always keep records and understand your local tax obligations.                  How to stay safe and avoid scam-linked mixers              If you decide to use a cryptocurrency mixer, your safety and security should be paramount. Here are some essential tips to avoid scams and legal troubles:Choose reputable mixers: Conduct thorough research. Look for mixers with good reviews, transparent operations and clear compliance policies.Avoid unknown or suspicious services: Steer clear of mixers linked to scams, hacks or regulatory actions.Check for licensing and compliance: Prefer mixers that comply with AML/KYC regulations, especially if you are a business or high-value user.Understand fees and timelines: Be clear on the fees involved and the expected time for your funds to be returned after mixing.Use hardware wallets and strong security practices: Always safeguard your private keys and use hardware wallets to minimize risks.Stay updated on regulations: Laws surrounding crypto mixers evolve rapidly. Staying informed will help you avoid inadvertent legal violations.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-mixer-and-how-does-it-work?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T12:00:15.000Z,"StarkWare launches mobile-friendly zero-knowledge prover","Blockchain company StarkWare has unveiled zero-knowledge (ZK) prover STARK Two (S-two), enabling enhanced privacy and verification on everyday devices like phones, laptops and browsers. The company said the new ZK prover allows users to generate complex cryptographic proofs from the client side. This means users can generate ZK-proofs directly on their devices instead of relying on a server or cloud infrastructure, opening the door for faster and more private applications across the internet. “S-two will bring STARK proving to everyday devices, and open the door for new real-world proving use cases,” said Eli Ben-Sasson, StarkWare co-founder and CEO, adding that the tool could empower the next wave of ZK applications. The company said the ZK prover is now available in public alpha and is set to roll out on Starknet, its Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, later this year.  StarkWare says new ZK prover is 39 times faster than old solutions StarkWare said that benchmark tests for the S-two ZK prover showed that it was 39 times faster than previous solutions. The performance leap enables smoother experiences in privacy-enhancing applications. The upgrade also allows use cases in private transactions, ZK-based identity and verifiable artificial intelligence. StarkWare said S-two runs on CPUs, GPUs and will soon be on browsers. “For years we’ve called the prover our magic wand, a tool that transforms complex computation into a simple proof,” Ben-Sasson said. “Now, the wand has become a lightsaber in your pocket, something anyone can wield, instantly, from your own device.”According to StarkWare, developers can build with S-two, adding that its alpha release supports hardware targets. Furthermore, the company said ZK ecosystem participants like Kakarot, Nexus, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs have already adopted the technology. Kakarot uses S-two inside ETHProofs to generate Ethereum block proofs more efficiently, while Nexus is standardizing RISC-V traces to align with S-two’s architecture. Meanwhile, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs are adding GPU acceleration to push the prover’s performance even further.Use cases for S-two zero-knowledge proverStarkWare chief operating officer Oren Katz told Cointelegraph that S-two marks a shift in how ZK-proofs are used in daily lives. Generating validity proofs directly in devices will allow privacy-preserving features in messaging, payments and digital identity. “You can prove a payment was valid without showing your balance, or verify identity without revealing personal details,” Katz added. Katz said that even salary payments could be made onchain with full transparency and no exposure of sensitive information. He dubbed the development a “big step toward bringing zero-knowledge tech into the mainstream.”Beyond privacy, Katz said, local proof generation also unlocks use cases in other industries. The executive told Cointelegraph that it can allow gamers to play offline and later generate cryptographic proof of their achievements. “An operator, instead of running all logic onchain to prove integrity, can run it on their own servers and simply generate a proof that it was executed correctly,” Katz added.Related: Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden’s cashless-society rethinkNew ZK prover follows Ethereum’s privacy pushThe launch of StarWare’s upgraded ZK prover follows Ethereum’s push for better privacy.

Subscriptions to BGUSD can be made using either USDC (USDC) or USDt (USDT), and the asset is redeemable back to USDC on demand.The company said the yield is derived from a basket of tokenized instruments, including US Treasury bills and high-grade money-market funds. “These assets are managed via partnerships with regulated institutional tokenization providers such as Superstate,” Bitget CEO Gracy Chen told Cointelegraph.The product’s structure is designed to reduce exposure to crypto volatility while delivering returns through traditional financial instruments. Bitget to roll out third-party attestationsIn response to questions about transparency, Chen said that Bitget is preparing to roll out third-party attestations to provide visibility into BGUSD’s asset backing.“Transparency and accountability are core principles of BGUSD’s framework,” she said. “While independent attestations are in the works, our institutional partners are already subject to rigorous audit requirements and regulatory oversight.”Chen clarified how Bitget maintains liquidity for users who want to redeem BGUSD. The executive said Bitget directly manages the reserve pool, which includes stable, on-hand assets like USDC. According to Chen, BGUSD does not fall under the definitions of a stablecoin or a security and is not subject to specific licensing requirements. “It’s structured as a yield-bearing stable asset certificate that’s exclusive to the Bitget platform,” Chen told Cointelegraph.Chen added that Bitget will limit access to BGUSD in jurisdictions where digital asset restrictions apply.

2025-05-27T08:45:00.000Z,"How central banks are testing blockchain-based monetary policy","Why are central banks looking at blockchains?              Central banks are tiptoeing into the world of blockchain not because it is fashionable but because every part of the money-making machine, from settlement rails to asset custody, is slowly being rewritten as code.The financial industry is already tokenizing money-market funds, Treasurys and even bank deposits. According to the Atlantic Council, 134 jurisdictions are studying or piloting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), up from just 35 in 2020. Meanwhile, commercial banks have begun to warn that if they cannot move tokenized deposits across public blockchains such as Solana or private ledgers like R3 Corda, they risk being left behind.From a central bank’s vantage point, two questions matter:First, can traditional operations, such as open-market purchases, standing facilities and reserve remuneration still work if reserves and government bonds become smart tokens? Second, can monetary transmission improve when policy logic is hard-wired into code? These questions motivate pilots such as Project Pine, Project Guardian in Singapore, the Bank of England’s wholesale CBDC sandbox and Japan’s multiyear retail CBDC pilot.                  What is “tokenized” monetary policy?              Tokenized monetary policy means that the liabilities and assets a central bank uses to steer short-term interest rates exist as programmable tokens on a distributed-ledger platform. In such a token arrangement, what the BIS describes as an ecosystem where money and securities share a common ledger, monetary functions are executed by smart contracts, replacing the traditional batch file processes used in overnight real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems.In practice, each policy tool is expressed as code:Interest on reserves becomes an automated coupon that accrues to a wallet address once a block closes.Repo and reverse-repo agreements become conditional asset swaps that self-liquidate at maturity.Collateral haircuts are numeric parameters the central bank can toggle in real time, with changes propagating instantly to all counterparties.Project Pine demonstrated all three, using ERC-20 tokens for reserves and securities on a permissioned Ethereum-compatible chain.But how is tokenized monetary policy different from traditional monetary policy?Traditional policy operations rely on central bank systems such as Fedwire or the Bank of England’s RTGS. These systems close overnight, settle in discrete batches and require multiple human sign-offs. A tokenized system settles atomically in seconds, keeps an immutable audit trail and lets policy adjustments propagate without waiting for dealers to book trades. The BIS paper on tokenisation notes that combining assets and settlement on a single ledger can shrink operational risk and latency.Did you know? A repo is a short-term secured loan in which one party sells securities and agrees to repurchase them later at a higher price. In contrast, a reverse repo is the same transaction viewed from the counterparty’s perspective (buying the securities and later reselling them).                  What is Project Pine?              Project Pine is a research initiative led by the BIS Innovation Hub and the New York Fed that explores how central banks could run monetary policy in a future where money and government securities are digital tokens managed on blockchain-like systems.Launched in late 2024 and published in May 2025, the project built a working prototype, a “starter kit” for central banks, designed to test whether tools like interest on reserves, repo operations and asset purchases can be run using smart contracts.The project ran simulated financial scenarios, mimicking both calm and crisis conditions:Normal conditions: The smart contract automatically conducted a one-day reverse-repo, draining reserves by posting bids at a pre-set interest rate.Liquidity shock: When simulated market stress pushed interest rates too high, an emergency lending facility kicked in automatically, within seconds, helping stabilize rates.Asset-purchase program: The toolkit accepted bids, calculated allocations and settled trades between digital reserves and tokenized bonds instantly.These scenarios were run in a test environment with simulated commercial banks and a programmable blockchain platform. Everything from interest payments to collateral valuation was automated, providing a glimpse into how monetary policy might function in a 24/7, tokenized financial system.This was not an isolated experiment. Other central banks are running parallel pilots that explore similar ground with their distinct approaches:Although temporarily offline as of May 24, 2025, MAS news releases show that Singapore’s Project Guardian has tested tokenized deposits and government bonds in live repo transactions, proving that interbank settlement can occur on a shared DLT without sending payments through Swift.Meanwhile, the Bank of England has taken a dual-rail approach. A July 2024 discussion paper stresses that wholesale tokenized money could sit alongside RTGS balances, letting commercial banks pick whichever rail meets their liquidity needs. Governor Andrew Bailey has warned that if tokenized deposits stall, the Bank “must continue to prepare for a wholesale CBDC.”On the retail front, Japan’s multi-year programme has entered a live “pilot” phase, constructing an end-to-end infrastructure, from smartphone wallets to a central ledger, capable of handling tens of thousands of transactions per second. The pilot also explores privacy-enhancing overlays, reflecting consumer expectations for cash-like anonymity.Taken together, these pilots confirm that key features like programmability, real-time visibility, and atomic settlement are no longer theoretical — they work. They don’t yet answer the more challenging question: How do central banks transition an entire financial system to such rails without disrupting credit creation and intermediation?Did you know? Project Pine’s digital monetary system is built like a three-layer cake: The bottom layer is a programmable blockchain (Besu), the middle is packed with tokenized money and assets (like ERC-20 reserves) and the top layer runs the smart contracts that carry out monetary policy actions.                  Why is Project Pine important?              Project Pine is the first of its kind to show that core central bank tools could be rebuilt using smart contracts. It proves that:Policy tools can be deployed faster, possibly within seconds.Facilities like repo or asset purchases can adapt automatically to changing market conditions.Tokenization could streamline operations, reduce friction and offer greater flexibility.Who was involved in Project Pine experiments?Seven major central banks, including those of Australia, Canada, England, Mexico, Switzerland, the EU and the US, collaborated on shaping the toolkit and defining test requirements. The findings don’t commit any of these banks to adopt such systems, but they provide a solid foundation for future research and policymaking.What did Project Pine test?To see how well the system works, Project Pine ran tests based on real-world situations, such as raising interest rates or a government debt crisis. They tried short and long periods, small and large financial systems, tight and loose money conditions and different ways of lending (like bank loans or corporate bonds). This helped check if the system could handle all kinds of economic ups and downs.Did you know? In Project Pine, central bank operations like paying interest on reserves or managing collateral aren’t done manually; they're handled by smart contracts coded directly into the top “protocol layer” of the blockchain stack.                  Practical design challenges in tokenized monetary policy              As central banks explore moving policy tools onto blockchains, they face several significant design hurdles. These aren’t just technical. They’re legal, operational and even philosophical. Here are the key ones:Interoperability: Can different blockchains talk to each other? Today’s financial system is like a highway with shared rules. However, blockchain ecosystems are more like separate islands, each with its own rules and roads. Public networks like Solana, private ones like Corda, or permissioned platforms like Besu don’t always “talk” to each other smoothly. This can cause issues like payment delays or funds getting stuck between platforms. Experts also warn that if too many users gather around one dominant blockchain, it could create unhealthy concentration, making the whole system more fragile.Legal finality: Does blockchain data legally count? Many countries still treat blockchain records as transaction evidence, not legally binding proof of ownership. So, even if a tokenized treasury bond moves onchain, the law might still require a separate “golden record” kept offchain by a trusted authority. Until legal systems catch up, this split could limit how far tokenized finance can go.Cyber resilience: What happens when something goes wrong? Blockchain systems run on code, and that code can have bugs. In a traditional setup, if something breaks, humans can step in. But with smart contracts, “code is law.” That’s why countries like Japan are building complete backup plans into their pilots. They’re testing how to respond to cyberattacks, technical failures or even smart contract glitches because in a digital money system, even a small error could have significant consequences.Privacy vs transparency: How much should be visible? Banks and regulators need transparency to monitor financial risks and prevent crime. But regular people want privacy, especially when using money for everyday purchases. Balancing those two needs is tricky. Policymakers are now experimenting with ideas like tiered disclosure (more visibility for big transactions), zero-knowledge proofs (which let you prove something without revealing all details), and even “anonymity vouchers” that let users make some transactions without being tracked.These challenges aren’t deal-breakers, but they do show that making money programmable isn’t as simple as flipping a switch. Central banks must work closely with lawmakers, cybersecurity experts and the financial industry to ensure tokenized monetary systems are safe, fair and reliable.                  The road ahead              The future of tokenized monetary policy will likely unfold in carefully staged phases, balancing innovation with financial stability.The BIS Innovation Hub lists more than a dozen ongoing tokenization projects from Australia’s Project Dunbar (multi-CBDC bridge) to Switzerland’s Project Helvetia (DLT-based repo). Commercial banks, meanwhile, are shifting rails: HSBC settled its first tokenized-deposit payment in April 2025, and Euroclear is piloting blockchain settlement for tokenized bonds.Central banks face a coordination game: Go slow and risk private standards hardening around them; go too fast and upend the funding model of commercial banks. The likeliest path is a phased approach:Stage 1: Limited-scope wholesale CBDC sandboxes plus tokenized collateral for central-bank counterparties.Stage 2: Dual-rail environments where RTGS balances and tokenized reserves interoperate via synchronization layers.Stage 3: Full adoption of smart-contract-based policy tools, possibly including real-time fiscal transfers.Just as earlier shifts like the rollout of RTGS systems or inflation-targeting regimes were introduced gradually to test and refine their impact, tokenized systems will be phased in through pilots, sandboxes and hybrid models before full-scale adoption.Whether it ultimately reshapes how central banks manage the economy remains to be seen.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-central-banks-are-testing-blockchain-based-monetary-policy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The pilot is expected to roll out after key infrastructure and regulatory checks are in place.“This approach can be immediately adapted for Thailand, provided the supporting systems are in place,” said Pichai, noting that the model avoids using the Thai baht directly, reducing risks to the domestic currency.Related: Crypto exchange KuCoin enters crowded Thailand marketCapital markets regulation under reviewBeyond enabling crypto use for tourism, Thailand is also planning a reform of its financial laws. Pichai said the government needs to unify the legal treatment of the traditional capital market and the digital asset space, which are currently governed by separate acts.Pichai also said the government is reviewing outdated restrictions on institutional investors as part of broader capital market reform. Life insurers and large funds holding hundreds of billions of Thai baht are restricted to government bonds. Upcoming changes may open more funds to equities and private sector assets.Pichai announcing the postponement of the next phase of digital wallets handout.

These tokens, he said, are expected to improve returns for savers and raise the global profile of Thai sovereign debt.On May 13, the Ministry of Finance announced plans to issue $150 million worth of digital investment tokens that allow retail investors to buy government bonds.This came after the country’s securities regulator revealed plans to launch a tokenized securities trading system for institutional investors back in February.In March, the Thai SEC also approved Tether’s USDt (USDT) and Circle’s USDC (USDC) for cryptocurrency trades, allowing the stablecoins to be listed on regulated exchanges across the country.Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/thailand-tourists-crypto-credit-cards-regulatory-reform?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave.However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation.This caused the long-term holder realized capitalization to surge past $28 billion, a level not seen since April. Realized cap is a measure of the value of each Bitcoin based on the last time it was moved, rather than the current market price.Long-term investors are using this period of forced selling to increase their exposure and accumulate more Bitcoin for the long run, Amr Taha noted. “This strategic accumulation during moments of market stress reflects the deep conviction of LTHs.”“Rather than being shaken out by short-term volatility, they [LTH] see these liquidation-driven dips as prime opportunities to strengthen their positions, reinforcing the foundation for future price appreciation.”BTC short-term holders (red) and long-term holders (green) net realized cap.

Antpool CEO Andy Chow said:\""Antpool has become the bridge operator for Bitlayer to support Bitcoin innovation and protect miners’ interests.”BitVM (Bitcoin Virtual Machine) is a framework that enables complex smart contracts to be deployed on the Bitcoin blockchain without changing the base protocol. The idea was introduced by Robin Linux in 2023, and allows for the complex computation involved in smart contract systems to be verified onchain and executed offchain in a way resembling optimistic rollups.Related: Here’s how Bitcoin is transforming into Web3’s backboneA BitVM implementationBitlayer is a BitVM implementation, aiming to allow Bitcoin to flow through decentralized finance (DeFi) systems and layer-2 networks. According to Chow, the implementation might lead to heightened activity in Bitcoin’s network and generate revenue for miners:“This expansion of Bitcoin’s use cases will drive more network activity, generating additional transaction fees and revenue opportunities for miners. As block rewards decrease over time, growing fee markets are critical for miners’ sustainable income.“Mining pools such as Chow’s Antpool play a critical role in the adoption of BitVM implementations because they directly determine the inclusion and validation of new types of transactions and scripts at the consensus layer.BitVM requires miners to include custom Taproot-based transactions that encode interactive verification logic. Mining pools must agree to include these non-standard or computationally intensive scripts in blocks, otherwise the protocol would simply not function.Related: StarkWare researchers propose smart contracts for Bitcoin with ColliderVMMining pool supportAccording to Hashrate Index data, Antpool controls 17.2% of Bitcoin’s hashrate as of May 26, while F2Pool controls 8.2% and Spiderpool 6.1%. This results in a total supporting hashrate of  31.5%.Bitcoin hashrate distribution between mining pools.

This is presumably enough for testing, prototyping and early-stage applications.With this percentage of supporting hashrate, developers can build functional systems with the assumption that, despite some latency, BitVM transactions will be processed. So while it is hard to view this hashrate as allowing a fully functional deployment, it is likely enough for the early phases of BitVM development.A Bitlayer representative told Cointelegraph that “should collective hashrate support weaken or policy shifts occur within Bitcoin Core, we have a multi-layered contingency plan.” This plan includes the “expanded mining pool partnerships,” referring to the company’s intention to keep onboarding more mining pools.Magazine: ZK-proofs are bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin — BitcoinOS and Starknet",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitlayer-secures-40-of-bitcoin-s-hashrate-to-bring-smart-contracts-to-btc?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

European stock markets responded positively to the development, but Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to hold the $110,000 level, leading traders to question whether a new all-time high remains within reach.Even if Bitcoin revisits the $105,000 mark, rising institutional interest and robust derivatives markets indicate that bullish traders are neither overleveraged nor concerned about a potential correction.Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized basis rate. Source: laevitas.chDemand for leveraged long Bitcoin positions grew, as evidenced by the BTC futures premium increasing to 8% on May 26. Although this was a modest rise from 6.5% the previous day, the metric still sits comfortably within the neutral range of 5% to 10%. For context, in December 2024, the Bitcoin futures premium surged to 20% when BTC surpassed $100,000 for the first time.Will Nvidia earnings and US economic data ignite Bitcoin price? President Trump’s decision to delay the EU import duties until July 9 reduced some market uncertainty, yet the broader economic consequences of the ongoing tariff conflict have yet to show up in corporate earnings. Investor risk appetite now hinges in part on Nvidia's (NVDA)  May 28 earnings report, and anticipation for this possibly explains Bitcoin’s inability to break through its previous highs.Bitcoin options markets are signaling an increased probability of upward movement. This suggests that whales and market makers remain confident, even with BTC trading just 2.6% below its record high of $111,957.Bitcoin options 30-day delta skew (put-call) at Deribit.

Source: CointelegraphRelated: SEC acknowledges slew of crypto ETF filings as reviews, approvals accelerateChanging regulatory stanceUnder the previous US presidential administration, the SEC brought enforcement actions against several crypto firms for offering staking services it alleged were unregistered securities offerings.Since President Donald Trump took office in January, the SEC has softened its stance.In February, the agency issued guidance stating that memecoins do not qualify as investment contracts under US law. In April, the regulator clarified that stablecoins also do not qualify as securities if they are marketed solely as a means of making payments.Still, the agency has yet to approve staking in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or issue formal guidance on how staking services can be offered compliantly in the US.Other policy goalsMuehr said she is optimistic the SEC will eventually approve staking for cryptocurrency ETFs, including for proposed Solana (SOL) funds.“Getting there means first getting the SEC comfortable with the structure,” she said, noting the industry has recently had “some productive meetings with the agency.”“I’m hopeful we’ll see a Solana ETF and even a staked Solana ETF in the US sometime soon.”The SEC is not the only agency the crypto industry is looking to persuade. Muehr said the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) — the top US tax authority — has also taken a position the industry opposes.“The IRS finally issued a statement saying staking rewards are service income,” she said. “We disagree with that interpretation and continue to engage.”Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-industry-groups-urge-sec-to-clarify-staking-stance?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Bitcoin has risen for seven consecutive weeks, and if buyers can extend the streak to eight weeks, it clears the path for further upside. Crypto analyst and trader Carpe Noctom said in a post on X that Bitcoin has only seen three instances of eight consecutive weekly positive closes, and every time, Bitcoin has been higher in the following 6 and 12 month time period.Institutional investors sense a long-term opportunity and, hence, have continued to pump money into Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs). CoinShares reported on May 26 that Bitcoin ETPs witnessed $2.9 billion in inflows last week, which is a quarter of the total inflows for 2024.Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360Although most analysts remain bullish over the long term, some are warning of a possible short-term pullback in Bitcoin. CryptoQuant contributor Crazzyblockk wrote in a QuickTake blog post that the data shows buyer exhaustion and increasing volatility, which could start a short-term correction toward $105,000. Could buyers catapult Bitcoin to a new all-time high, pulling altcoins higher? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.S&P 500 Index price predictionThe S&P 500 Index (SPX) turned down from 5,968 and reached the 20-day exponential moving average (5,759).SPX daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIf the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the index could gradually climb toward the overhead resistance of 6,000. Sellers are expected to pose a strong challenge in the 6,000 to 6,147 zone.The short-term advantage will favor the bears on a break and close below the 20-day EMA. The index could then plummet to the 50-day simple moving average (5,584), which is likely to attract buyers. US Dollar Index price predictionThe bulls tried to push the US Dollar Index (DXY) above the 20-day EMA (100.15) on May 22, but the bears held their ground.DXY daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewSellers are trying to strengthen their position by pulling the price below the 99 support. If they manage to do that, the index could continue its slide to the solid support at 97.92. Buyers are expected to defend the 97.92 level with all their might because a break below it may sink the index to 95.67.Buyers will have to drive and maintain the price above the 50-day SMA (101.26) to indicate that the corrective phase may be over.Bitcoin price predictionBitcoin bulls are trying to push and sustain the price above $109,588, indicating that every minor dip is being purchased.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory signal that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers shove the price above $111,980, the BTC/USDT pair could skyrocket to $130,000.The 20-day EMA ($104,886) is the vital support to watch out for on the downside. A break and close below the 20-day EMA could tempt short-term buyers to book profits. That could sink the pair to the psychologically crucial $100,000 level, where buyers are expected to mount a strong defense.Ether price predictionEther (ETH) turned up from the 20-day EMA ($2,425) on May 25, indicating solid demand at lower levels. ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls will try to drive the price above the $2,738 obstacle again. If they succeed, the ETH/USDT pair could soar to $3,000. The bears will try to halt the up move at $2,850, but the bulls are likely to prevail.If the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are losing their grip. The pair could dip to $2,323 and then to $2,111.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) has been oscillating between $2.65 and $2, signaling equilibrium between buyers and sellers.XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe flattish 20-day EMA ($2.34) and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price turns up and breaks above $2.48, the bulls will have another go at the $2.65 resistance. If they clear the overhead hurdle, the XRP/USDT pair could soar to $3.On the other hand, a break and close below the 50-day SMA could sink the pair to the solid support at $2. Buyers are expected to vigorously defend the $2 level because a break below it may sink the pair to $1.61.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) has started to move toward the overhead resistance of $693 after taking support at the 20-day EMA ($652).BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate an advantage to buyers. If bulls kick the price above $693, the BNB/USDT pair could rally to the $732 to $761 overhead zone.Contrarily, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bears are trying to seize control. The pair could slump to $633 and subsequently to the 50-day SMA ($617).Solana price predictionSolana (SOL) took support at the 20-day EMA ($169) on May 25, indicating that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on minor dips.SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls will again attempt to drive the price above the $188 overhead resistance. If they can pull it off, the SOL/USDT pair could surge to $210 and eventually to $220. Sellers will have to pull the price below the 20-day EMA to prevent the upside. The pair could then plunge to the 50-day SMA ($151), which is likely to act as solid support. A bounce off the 50-day SMA could signal a few days of range-bound action between $153 and $188.Related: Solana following Bitcoin?

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe price has bounced off the 20-day EMA, opening the gates for a rally to the overhead resistance of $0.26. Buyers will have to pierce the $0.26 level to start the next leg of the uptrend to $0.30 and then to $0.35.Alternatively, a break and close below the $0.21 support suggests the bears are back in the game. The DOGE/USDT pair could then swing inside a large range between $0.26 and $0.14 for some time.Cardano price predictionBuyers are trying to keep Cardano (ADA) above the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern but have failed to start a strong rebound.ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe 20-day EMA ($0.75) is flattening out, and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. Buyers will have to propel the price above $0.86 to tilt the advantage in their favor. If they manage to do that, the ADA/USDT pair could rally to $1.01. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the neckline, it suggests that the bulls have given up. The pair could then drop to the $0.60 support, which is likely to attract buyers.Hyperliquid price predictionHyperliquid (HYPE) has been in a strong uptrend for the past several days. Buyers asserted their supremacy by pushing the price above the $35.73 resistance on May 25.HYPE/USDT daily chart.

If the HYPE/USDT pair rebounds off $35.73, it increases the likelihood of a rally above $42.25.
