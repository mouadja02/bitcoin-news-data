2025-05-28T14:45:54.000Z,"ZachXBT knocks back James Wynn’s denial of coordinated token launches in his name","Blockchain detective ZachXBT refuted James Wynn’s claim that a conspiracy group is launching tokens in his name and scamming users at price peaks. He argued that Wynn has run the same type of memecoin scams on his followers over the past few years. James Wynn is known in crypto for his high-leverage contract trading and meme coin investments. He has also faced criticism over his promotion of low-cap tokens. Star Platinum showed that the crypto trader promoted tokens like WLON and WYNN, which were supposedly tied to him. Wynn denies pumping and dumping meme coins 🚨 WARNING 🚨 SCAM ALERT 🚨 you literally pumped and dumped the same kind of meme coin scams on your followers over the past few years. https://t.co/aqxuMW3WJY — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) May 28, 2025 In July 2024, Dylan accused Wynn of receiving 2% of the Babypepe supply and gradually dumping it after inflating the price. He faced backlash for not only dumping the tokens that the CTO team worked hard to acquire, but he also sold them to his followers, profiting $68,000. James Wynn was also linked to the recent controversy around the Solana meme coin MOONPIG. The trader allegedly purchased about 3% of the digital asset’s total supply, helped pump its price to a peak, and then sold off his holdings, which some in the community argued caused the sharp price drop. Wynn denied the accusations and any wrongdoing, arguing that he was only an investor and not involved in developing or manipulating the coin. He claimed that the top wallet was never his, and he doesn’t usually entertain such FUD. Alongside his high-profile rise, there are controversies and doubts around his type of digital asset investments, marked with significant losses and allegations of questionable practices. Wynn’s trading activity can be tracked from as early as December 2020. Pseudonymous user Star Platinum revealed that the trader reportedly received $6,000 in Ethereum from the now-defunct firm linked to Sam Bankman-Fried, Alameda Research. He started to attract more attention to his trades a few years later. Wynn notes in his X bio that he was one of the early investors of PEPE, a token inspired by the globally recognized ‘Pepe the Frog’ meme. The crypto trader bet on the digital asset when its total market value was $600,000. Wynn later predicted in April 2023 that PEPE would reach a $4.2 billion market cap, an unorthodox call made when the coin was just at a $4.2 million market cap. The trader’s bet turned lucrative, following PEPE’s success, which made his early investments into millions. After success with meme coins, Wynn shifted focus to leveraged trading and joined Hyperliquid. Lookonchain noted that he has been actively trading on the platform since March 13, racking up $46.5 million in profit in under 2 months. James Wynn records losses and gains on his crypto trades On-chain data from Hyperdash revealed that the trader has executed a total of 39 trades, with 17 of them resulting in profits. The firm also showed he has reduced his BTC long position, now valued at $200M, with a floating loss of ~$800K. The analytics firm also noted that Wynn’s PNL rose from $5.7M to $87M from May 5 to May 23 but currently stands at $1.91M. The crypto trader has lost around $55.3M in less than a week. On-chain data showed that Wynn’s most profitable trades include a long position in PEPE, which garnered $25.19 million in profit, followed by a long position in Bitcoin, with $6.83 million generated. Lookonchain data also highlighted that Wynn has benefited from Hyperliquid, paying the platform approximately $2.31 million in trading fees. James Wynn suffered his largest loss on May 25, around $15.86 million on a short Bitcoin position. He has also previously lost other trades, including around $3.69 million on a long Ethereum trade, approximately $1.59 million on a long Sui position, and $976,635 lost on a long BTC trade.

Vitalik Buterin Proposes RISC-V : Ethereum’s co-founder has suggested replacing the EVM bytecode with the RISC-V instruction set, making Ethereum more adaptable, efficient, and future-ready. Base Layer Activity Drops: Despite innovations, Ethereum collected just 3.18 ETH in blob fees, with average gas fees at $0.16 in April, the lowest since 2020. This has raised sustainability concerns but is also making the network more accessible. Ethereum Price Prediction 2025 The Ethereum price is expected to maintain its upward trajectory and form higher highs. Furthermore, with increased adoption, newer upgrades, and network growth, the ETH coin price can smash the $5k mark and hit a new all-time high of $5,925. Conversely, rising uncertainty or any unfavorable global economic events could pull the ETH price toward its annual low of $2,917. Considering the market sentiments, the average price could settle at around $3,392.

On the other hand, the Ethereum price might drop to $5,566, with an average of $5,713. Ethereum Price Forecast 2027 The Ethereum 2027 forecast expects the ETH coin price to make a new all-time high at $8,705. However, a correction based on market shortcomings may drive the ETH crypto to $6,800, with an average of $7,246. Ether Price Prediction 2028 In 2028, the chances of Ethereum dominating the crypto market rise as the ETH price potentially makes a new high at $10,410. On the other hand, the altcoin might fall to $8,613, making an average of $9,482. Ethereum Forecast 2029 Approaching its all-time high of $12,994 in 2029, the Ethereum price is expected to surpass the psychological barrier of $12,000. In case of a correction, $ETH may reach a low of $10,192, with an average price of $11,111. Ethereum Price Prediction 203 0 The ETH crypto price is projected to reach a new all-time high of $15,575 in 2030, with a potential low of $12,647 and an average price of $14,163.

2025-05-28T14:44:41.000Z,"ChatGPT picks two cryptos to turn $100 into $1,000 by 2026","With the second half of 2025 fast approaching, Finbold probed OpenAI’s ChatGPT to uncover which cryptocurrencies it believes could deliver outsized returns in the year ahead. The brief was ambitious but clear: identify assets that could realistically turn a $100 investment into $1,000 by 2026. While a 900% return in 8 months is a high bar, and naturally involves considerable risk, ChatGPT narrowed its picks to two altcoins it believes offer the strongest blend of narrative, adoption potential, and real-world catalysts. The AI’s reasoning leaned on macro trends, upcoming regulatory shifts, and ongoing institutional interest, especially in areas with growing infrastructure and enterprise-grade use cases. XRP is pick number 1 The first pick is XRP , currently trading at $2.31. ChatGPT pointed to XRP’s continued traction with international financial institutions and the potential for a U.S.-based spot ETF approval as major upside drivers. A $50 investment today buys approximately 21.6 XRP tokens, and the model suggests a plausible target of around $11.50 by 2026, a fivefold increase. This would value that initial $50 stake at $250. The bullish case rests on a scenario where regulatory clarity boosts institutional inflows, particularly in payments infrastructure. The AI emphasized that XRP has already been integrated into cross-border transactions and settlement pipelines globally, positioning it as a “realistic, strong catalyst” pick. Avalanche is pick number 2 The second pick is Avalanche ( AVAX ) , a smart contract platform and Ethereum competitor known for its high transaction throughput and modular subnetwork architecture. At a current price of $23.59, a $50 allocation nets about 2.12 AVAX. If the token reaches $118, that investment could grow to $250. ChatGPT highlighted Avalanche’s rapidly expanding DeFi ecosystem and corporate partnerships as reasons why the coin has “moderate risk but high-growth potential.” With a much lower market cap relative to competitors like Solana, ChatGPT sees AVAX as well-positioned for strong upside if momentum turns bullish through 2025. ChatGPT picks to cryptocurrencies. Source: ChatGPT The model was also asked why it excluded more obvious candidates like Bitcoin, Solana, or meme coins like Pepe. It noted that while Bitcoin remains a foundational asset ($109,000 at press time), expecting a 5x move in under a year, to over half a million dollars, would require a major global shock, not just bullish momentum. Solana, trading around $174, would need to climb to approximately $870 for the same return, which, while not impossible, is a much steeper hill compared to AVAX’s lower base. Pepe, on the other hand, was dismissed as being more driven by hype cycles than by fundamentals, making it an unreliable 5x target.

The investment case hinges on retail trading growth and institutional Bitcoin adoption. Subscription & services revenue is the signal in its Q1 results, and transaction revenues are noise. As crypto adoption spreads, Coinbase is positioned as the trusted infrastructure provider for sovereigns and corporations. In a landmark decision, Coinbase Global ( COIN ) became the first crypto-native company to be added to the S&P 500. Millions of 401k's across the United States now have exposure to a company with Bitcoin (BTC-USD) in its corporate treasury. Many average Americans now have exposure to Bitcoin by proxy. Beyond the headline, though, Coinbase has quietly positioned itself to be a dominant player in cryptocurrency for years to come. As this nascent industry continues to take shape, there is a very high likelihood that Coinbase will continue to grow alongside it. Coinbase is uniquely positioned to benefit from two bullish tailwinds currently: speculative retail trading and institutional Bitcoin adoption. These are two meaningful growth levers in a volatile industry. As a trusted custodian and dominant exchange, it stands to benefit regardless of who enters the market; be they retail traders, corporations, or sovereigns. I rate the stock a Buy. Company Overview Coinbase facilitates the trading and custody of cryptocurrency. The company offers exchange services; allowing users to buy crypto with USD, swap cryptocurrencies with each other, stake crypto, and earn interest on cash with stablecoins. The Custodian of Choice Coinbase is by far the largest Bitcoin custodian for Bitcoin ETFs, holding the keys for 8 of the 11 major Bitcoin ETFs. It custodies 90% of the Bitcoin held in ETFs. On top of that, Coinbase is deeply embedded within the US government, as it custodies the crypto assets that are seized by the U.S. Marshals Service . The company earns a small fee on assets under custody (\""AUC\""), which varies by entity. Enterprise and sovereign interest in holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset is still a relatively niche concept, but Coinbase has put the infrastructure in place to facilitate the mass adoption of such. Investment Case The investment case in Coinbase is quite simple. It hinges on two key factors: 1) an increase in retail speculation and 2) an increase in institutional adoption. Retail trading volume is directly linked to market volatility. During the crypto winter of 2022, brought on by the collapse of FTX (a key Coinbase competitor), Coinbase trading volumes plummeted, and the stock value fell in concert. We are a long way from that crypto winter. Bitcoin recently eclipsed the $100k threshold again for the first time since February. The regulatory environment has become much warmer. The crypto market is rampaging forward. Retail speculation typically spikes in periods like this. Further, the trend toward institutional and governmental adoption is clear. Three states have started strategic Bitcoin reserves, and the New York City mayor hosted the first-ever Crypto Summit this month. There are more institutions now than ever before accumulating Bitcoin. This trend seems certain to continue. As more companies begin accumulating Bitcoin, Coinbase stands to benefit disproportionately compared to the companies that currently hold Bitcoin. The initial institutions that adopted Bitcoin are tech fanatics like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) ( MSTR ) or crypto-native companies like MARA Holdings ( MARA ) or Block ( XYZ ), so they don't rely on custodian partners like Coinbase. They self-custody their keys. As more non-crypto native companies seek to simply participate in the upside of Bitcoin without worrying about key maintenance, Coinbase's custody services are the best choice. The company is the largest and most well-regarded, as illustrated by its partnership with ETFs and the US government. This holds true for sovereigns as well, who need not bother with key maintenance. They simply desire a reserve asset, and Bitcoin is increasingly being considered as such. Many governments will likely opt for a custodian partner. Coinbase already has a vote of confidence from the most influential government in the world. It's a very privileged position to be in. In short, the two core underlying factors that will drive positive stock returns for Coinbase are looking extremely bullish. As these trends continue throughout 2025, I expect the stock to significantly outperform the major indices. Q1 Earnings Coinbase generated $2b in total revenue, split between $1.3b in transaction revenues and $698m in subscription and services growth. The 10% sequential decline in revenues was driven by a sharp 19% decline in transaction revenue in the quarter. The subscription and services segment, which includes custodian fees, stablecoin revenue (Coinbase shares USDC interest revenues with Circle), and Coinbase One subscriptions, grew 9% QoQ. The company suffered from the relative weakness of the crypto market in Q1. The crypto market is horribly volatile, as any crypto trader or onlooker is well aware, and this volatility hits Coinbase quite hard. This underpins the importance of the durable subscription & services line items. The company expects this to drop marginally next quarter to $600m-$680m, but management is focused on growing this line item over time. Coinbase's long-term value creation hinges far more on subscription & services growth rather than retail trading volume. The crypto market is basically the stock market on steroids. The fickle nature of retail equity traders is amplified in crypto trading because a much larger share of the overall crypto trading volume is comprised of retail funds. As bear markets take hold, volumes plummet. And vice versa. This makes Coinbase's trading revenue a very volatile metric and not one that should be relied upon for long-term investment returns. The subscription & services segment is the signal in Coin's Q1 report, transactions revenue bumpiness is noise. The company is set to compound subscription & services revenues quite well. The growth in sovereign and enterprise adoption will lead to durable growth in the company's custodial business, while the returns from a bull market should lead to increasing USDC balances. I believe the market broadly has bottomed for 2025 and considering crypto as an asset class is very high beta, I see a lot of upside. This will mostly be powered by Bitcoin, which is the leading indicator for all crypto returns. I've written on Bitcoin several times, most recently explaining why the seminal cryptocurrency benefits from President Trump's tariff gambit . Bitcoin has several other bullish tailwinds, namely the increasingly fervent pace of institutional adoption, the financialization of Bitcoin, and more regulatory clarity. With rising government and enterprise adoption of Bitcoin, Coinbase will enjoy a twofold benefit. First, I expect the ensuing supply shock in Bitcoin to send the price much higher in the coming months. This will pull the overall crypto market up along with it and increase transaction revenues for Coinbase. Second, Coinbase is likely to be the custodian of choice for many of these large entities, providing durable growth for subscription and services. The stock has a lot of upside potential in the coming months. This upside potential is why I believe that, despite the premium valuation , Coinbase presents quite a compelling opportunity right now. The company trades at a hefty 43x forward non-GAAP earnings, 9x forward sales, and 27x forward EV/EBIT. These are high for a company with bumpy growth, but we're at a favorable point in the cycle. The volatility of crypto deserves a premium. Bitcoin is wavering around all-time highs, and more institutions than ever are piling in. The regulatory environment is clearing up. It's highly likely the flagship cryptocurrency will go much higher before it goes lower, so I find it very likely that Coinbase will exceed expectations in trading revenues 2025. An upside surprise in transaction revenues justifies a premium multiple for now, but as previously stated, this cannot be relied on for long-term returns. What will drive long-term returns is the company's institutional business, which benefits enormously from the recent spate of companies (like GameStop and DJT media) buying Bitcoin. This trend allows Coinbase to diversify its revenue base and shield it from the worst of crypto's downside volatility. The company's position as the leading institutional partner absolutely justifies a premium valuation, and at the moment, I see further upside due to my expectation of a surprise beat in transaction revenues this year. Risks Of course, half of my investment thesis here hinges on the crypto bull market continuing on through the remainder of 2025. This is anything but certain. Sentiment in crypto turns to despair just as quickly as euphoria takes hold. A lot of Bitcoin's current bullish price action hinges on institutional adoption driving a strong supply shortage. Should there be hiccups in this road; major institutions selling their Bitcoin, ETFs shuttering, or Bitcoin whales taking profits en masse, the crypto market could quickly tumble into a bear market. To me, this seems unlikely. But it is far from impossible. Further, much of the recent euphoria in crypto markets stems from an increasingly favorable regulatory environment. US President Donald Trump has cozied up to cryptocurrency, New York City is taking steps to become the 'crypto capital of the world', and several states are considering strategic Bitcoin reserves. Bitcoin price action front-ran many of these announcements, and should the regulatory environment take longer to adjust favorably for crypto, we could see material downside in Coinbase's trading revenues. Investor Takeaway Coinbase is a rare source of transparency in a trustless environment. The company recently encountered a data breach , and CEO Brian Armstrong took to X (formerly Twitter) to report on the issue . This is the type of transparency that will keep Coinbase relevant for years to come. This is what the crypto industry desperately needs. This is what has allowed the company to become the custodial partner of the largest financial institutions in the world. It is what will allow the company to continue innovating and compounding in an industry widely criticized for its lack of utility and value destruction. Coinbase isn't betting on crypto's future success. It's building the infrastructure to define and facilitate that success. I rate the company a Buy.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4790480-coinbase-winner-bitcoin-institutional-adoption-initiate-with-buy?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","COIN",cryptocompare
2025-05-28T14:36:13.000Z,"SPX6900 reclaims $1 with organic demand: what’s next for SPX price?","SPX6900 (SPX) exhibits robust bullishness as the broad crypto market consolidated after the latest bull run. SPX has reclaimed the psychological price mark of $1 today after rebounding from the support barrier at $0.83 early this week. The altcoin touched $1.02 today, up 35% and 10% in the past seven days and 24 hours, respectively. However, the question remains. Does SPX boast adequate steam to push further? SPX6900 rallies with buy-side momentum The altcoin’s daily trading volume jumped 90% as it regained $1, signaling renewed investor and trader interest in SPX. Technical indicators signal surged accumulation accompanying the alt’s recovery. For instance, the Chaikin Money Flow has climbed from -0.04 in mid-May to +0.06 at press time. Source – TradingView Such trends confirm continued asset purchases, indicating organic demand behind SPX6900’s ongoing recovery. Moreover, Coinalyze data shows buyers accumulated 1.27 million tokens in the past day, with 506,000 positive Delta. The dynamic shift in exchange activity also supports the changing trend. SPX’s earlier recoveries halted as sellers dominated trading platforms with positive net flow. Now, exchange net flows have been in the negative region for three successive days, reading -$620 at press time, indicating outflows outpacing inflows. That signals heightened demand as withdrawals from the market outshine deposits. Coinglass statistics support the upside bias. SPX’s Open Interest jumped 35% to $69.41 million. That shows traders executing new long positions as they anticipated extended gains. Amplified spot demand, exchange outflows, and dominant long positions confirm stable price actions, not hype-driven recoveries. The bullish crossover between the SPX price and the Relative Strength Index demonstrates buyer resurgence. SPX’s current price action The alt trades at $1.01 with a massive upside momentum supported by organic demand. Chart by Coinmarketcap SPX6900 has validated its recovery catalysts in the past 24 hours. Continued demand will help SPX hold above $1 and target $1.3. That would translate to a nearly 30% surge from the altcoin’s current market price. Such trends could propel SPX6900 to the January 19 peak of $1.8. Nevertheless, SPX hovers at a key juncture. It has gained over 70% this month after stable uptrends from the 8 May low of $04824. The massive returns will likely attract profit-taking. That could postpone SPX6900’s anticipated surges in the near term. The Relative Strength Index reads 70, highlighting overbought conditions. Possible profit booking could catalyze corrections to $0.9073. Losing the $0.8 barrier will invalidate SPX’s short-term recoveries. Broad market developments will also shape SPX6900’s trajectory in the upcoming sessions. Bitcoin hovers at $108,359 and should close above $110K for continued gains in the short term. Renowned analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that Bitcoin hasn’t topped, suggesting more gains. He stated: Bitcoin (BTC) traders are currently sitting on 27% average profits. Historically, things start to look toppy once profits exceed 40%. Source – Ali on X Thus, Bitcoin could rally further before potential profit-taking materializes. Such trends will support SPX6900’s anticipated surges.

Despite being already flush with cash, the company offered debt in March to raise the funds for BTC acquisitions in a strategic shift to include crypto in its financial strategy. GameStop Acquires 4,710 Bitcoin According to a Form 8-K filing , the Grapevine, Texas-headquartered firm purchased 4,710 BTC after completing a $1.5 billion convertible notes offering in early April. https://twitter.com/gamestop/status/1927679297252364502 The Bitcoin investment follows GameStop’s move to diversify its balance sheet. Rumors about GameStop’s interest in Bitcoin began to circulate in February after GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen posted an uncaptioned photo of himself with Michael Saylor, Strategy Executive Chairman and a vocal advocate for corporate Bitcoin treasury reserves. The rumors intensified days later after a CNBC report days later revealed that the favorite meme stock of the pandemic era was considering investments in alternative assets, including BTC. Then, in March, the company’s board unanimously greenlit a plan to adopt the benchmark crypto as a treasury reserve asset. Following The Strategy Bitcoin Playbook Saylor’s Strategy has issued billions of dollars of convertible senior notes, raising capital to purchase more Bitcoin than it could otherwise. GameStop now joins a slew of other companies like Tokyo-listed Metaplanet that have added Bitcoin to their balance sheet in a playbook popularized by Strategy. According to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net, over 210 firms worldwide hold BTC, with Strategy remaining the largest corporate holder of the apex crypto. At press time, Strategy holds 580,250 BTC, or just over $45 billion worth, since it began buying Bitcoin in 2020.

2025-05-28T14:30:40.000Z,"Wells Fargo Raises Price Target for One US Financial Stock That’s Up 48% Since Liberation Day-Induced Crash: Report","Wells Fargo is updating its outlook on Ares Management Corporation (ARES), reportedly issuing a bullish forecast for the $52 billion global alternative investment manager. Wells Fargo analyst Michael Brown is raising Ares’s price target from $182 to $189, while reiterating an overweight rating, reports Insider Monkey. Brown says the firm’s ongoing performance and future prospects remain strong. Ares Management reported $1.04 billion in the first quarter of the year, a 38.21% increase. The firm is also well-positioned to perform well despite the market volatility caused by US President Donald Trump’s announced tariffs on April 2nd, so-called “Liberation Day,” and other geopolitical events, which has led to a decline in liquid credit and equity markets due to traditional capital providers shifting to a risk-off position, according to the report. Ares plummeted to a low of about $110 on April 4th, but has since surged about 48% since then. According to the analysis, Ares’ business model allows it to avoid having to sell assets amid market uncertainty due “to its management fee-centric approach, low balance sheet leverage and reliance on long-dated and locked-up third-party capital.” Over 72% of Ares’s total assets under management are in credit-related products. Also in the first quarter of the year, Ares raised over $20 billion in gross new capital commitments, the company’s highest Q1 fundraising on record. ARES is trading for $164.60 at time of writing, up more than 2% in the last 24 hours.

El Salvador Plays Defiant Game With IMF Bitcoin Rules The new Bitcoin acquisition, announced by El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office, came shortly after IMF staff and El Salvadoran authorities reached a staff-level agreement on the first review of the 40-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF). EL SALVADOR JUST BOUGHT MORE BITCOIN pic.twitter.com/HlEJMkFIOW — The Bitcoin Office (@bitcoinofficesv) May 28, 2025 In March, El Salvador signed a deal with the IMF to receive a $3.5 billion loan package. Bitcoin was stripped of its mandatory legal tender status, meaning merchants no longer need to accept the currency on a mandatory basis. As part of the agreement, El Salvador must fulfill its previous obligations regarding limiting further government involvement in Bitcoin, and it will have to wind down public sector involvement with the Chivo wallet by the end of July. “On Bitcoin, efforts will continue to ensure that the total amount of Bitcoin held across all government-owned wallets remains unchanged,” the IMF stated. Moreover, the deal prohibited the “voluntary accumulation of the premier crypto by the public sector,” meaning that El Salvador wouldn’t be allowed to keep stockpiling BTC if it wanted to keep complying with the loan package.

2025-05-28T14:27:08.000Z,"Will Ethereum (ETH) Make the Expected Attack and Exceed $3,000? Analyst Answered!","The largest altcoin, Ethereum (ETH), which has been performing poorly against Bitcoin (BTC) for a long time, has made a big attack in recent weeks and rose from $ 1,800 levels to $ 2,700 levels. As ETH enters a consolidation period, the market expects the price to exceed $ 3,000 in the short term. While there is curiosity about whether Ethereum will make a big attack again, market analyst Omkar Godbole evaluated the possibility of ETH exceeding $ 3,000. Accordingly, the analyst argued that Ethereum has formed an ascending triangle pattern that points to a potential increase above $3,000. Stating that the ETH chart has formed an ascending triangle pattern, the analyst said that it seems ready to exceed $3,000. The ascending triangle forms a pattern that repeatedly limits upward sloping movements with a resistance line. The ascending triangle formation is generally considered a bullish formation, and after the break of the horizontal resistance line, a rise as high as a flagpole is usually expected. At this point, the analyst noted that Ethereum has faced resistance at $2,735 several times in the last two weeks, and said that ETH has formed higher lows, indicating an ascending triangle. Stating that higher lows indicate increasing buying pressure, the analyst stated that this pressure increases the potential for ETH to rise above $3,000. “An expected upward breakout of the ascending triangle pattern would signal that ETH has resumed its rally from the lows seen in April at $1,390 and open the door for a move above $3,000.” The analyst also noted that the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is very close to breaking above the 100-day SMA, which he said supports the bullish case. Finally, the analyst also warned that a downward breakout of the triangle formation on the Ethereum chart could invalidate the bull case and cause stronger selling pressure. *This is not investment advice.

XRP is now down by 2% in a week and by 12% in the past fortnight, although the fourth-biggest coin in the market keeps an impressive 330% increase in the last 12 months. The token’s moves over the past few weeks have followed a sharp decline in active XRP Ledger addresses , indicating a pronounced decline in interest among traders. Yet this isn’t likely to continue for much longer, with the approach of XRP ETFs later in the year signalling very good things for the long-term XRP price prediction . XRP Price Prediction: Onchain Activity Flashes Danger – Big Drop Possible? If we look at CryptoQuant’s active addresses chart for XRP, we see that addresses have declined from a peak of 108,000 on December 2 to a six-month low of 23,000 today. Source: CryptoQuant This is an 80% decline, which is far in excess of the 30.5% drop in price XRP has suffered since the coin reached a seven-year high of $3.31 on January 18. This arguably signals a big drop in interest, yet one positive is that active addresses are still higher now than they were for much of the two-year period prior to the Trump rally beginning in November 2024. As such, it would be rash to assume that this decline predicts a big incoming drop in the XRP price, especially when inactive addresses can indicate longer term holding. But if we look at the XRP chart today, we see that its indicators have been weakening over the past couple of days, signalling more losses (although not necessarily steep losses) in the near term. Its RSI (purple) has dropped from 70 in early May to just under 50 today, and it could continue to fall over the next few days. Source: TradingView Based on such factors, it would be reasonable to predict that the XRP price could drop back to $2.20 or a bit lower this week or the next. But XRP’s strong fundamentals would point to a fairly quick rebound, potentially to $2.50 or higher by the end of July. In 2024 BTC ETFs launched, BTC went from $35K – $99K. In 2025 XRP ETFs will launch. Can you guess how much XRP price would be by 12/31/25?

New Presale Tokens Could Rally Soon As strong as XRP remains, one way of boosting your exposure to potential gains is to diversify into smaller tokens, which during their initial growth spurts can vastly outpace the market. This would include presale tokens, with the biggest sales sometimes leading to big rallies when the corresponding tokens list for the first time. The biggest presale happening right now belongs to Solaxy (SOLX), a Solana-based token that has now raised a whopping $41.5 million in its offering. $SOLX reigns supreme. 41M Raised! pic.twitter.com/uEUXlekkL0 — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) May 27, 2025 This is an impressive sum, with Solaxy also boasting an X account with 77,000 followers , another early sign of its potential future popularity. And what’s giving Solaxy so much potential is the fact that it’s launching a layer-two network for Solana, one which promises to make the Solana ecosystem more efficient for traders. Its L2 will provide ultra-low transaction fees and confirmation times, while also enabling instant bridging between itself and Solana. The project is also in the process of developing its own DEX , with Solaxy aiming to become an important hub for meme tokens and DeFi. And given that SOLX will be necessary to pay Solaxy’s transaction fees, the token could become very sought-after very soon.

2025-05-28T14:15:00.000Z,"Elderly crypto investors are getting scammed: Teach them these key safety tips","Why are seniors being targeted in crypto scams? Scammers prey on seniors because they view them as financially secure, trusting and less familiar with rapidly evolving technology. Let’s understand why seniors are key targets. Perception of wealth: Many older adults have retirement savings or pensions, making them lucrative targets. Lower tech fluency: Navigating crypto wallets , private keys and blockchain concepts can be intimidating, something scammers exploit. Embarrassment prevents reporting: Victims often feel ashamed, making them less likely to report the crime. Crypto is irreversible: Once funds are sent via Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, there’s no reversing the transaction. That’s a dream scenario for scammers. According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), seniors report growing losses linked to cryptocurrency investment fraud , romance scams and government impersonation. In South Carolina’s Beaufort County alone, seniors reported over $3.1 million in crypto scam losses in 2024. And these scams are becoming more sophisticated. AI tools can now clone voices, spoof caller IDs and create fake websites that mimic legitimate exchanges or financial institutions to steal from unsuspecting seniors. Examples of crypto scams targeting older adults From crypto romance fraud in Cambodia targeting British pensioners to ATM scams in Minnesota and impersonation schemes across the US, scammers have stolen millions by preying on older adults’ trust and unfamiliarity with digital assets. 1. Cambodian scam compounds exploiting British pensioners In Bavet, Cambodia, scam compounds operated by networks linked to the Chinese mafia have been uncovered. These operations enslave trafficked workers, forcing them to participate in romance and cryptocurrency fraud . British pensioners have been prime targets, suffering significant losses.. One victim from the West Midlands lost over 250,000 British pounds ($340,000). These scams often employ “pig-butchering” tactics , cultivating trust online before executing large-scale financial fraud. 2. Crypto ATM scams in Minnesota In Minnesota, over 5,500 incidents involving cryptocurrency kiosks led to losses exceeding $189 million in 2023. Seniors were the most vulnerable victims, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the stolen funds. Scammers often direct victims to transfer funds using QR codes tied to fraudulent accounts. Cities like Stillwater have implemented bans on crypto ATMs to protect residents. 3. Romance scam targeting a disabled woman in the UK Lisa Nock, a 44-year-old woman from Staffordshire with autism and mobility issues, fell victim to a romance scam after being targeted on Instagram by someone impersonating Australian TV vet Dr. Chris Brown. Over 18 months, the scammer manipulated her into transferring £11,000 in cryptocurrency, claiming the funds were for flights, visas and hiring a substitute vet. Lisa eventually realized the deceit and reported the fraud to authorities. 4. Government or bank impersonators demanding crypto payments Scammers may impersonate the IRS, Social Security Administration, Medicare or local law enforcement. Their script is simple: You’re in legal trouble or owe back taxes, and the only way to avoid arrest or penalties is to pay in Bitcoin. This tactic has been used across the US. In South Carolina, a retired healthcare worker named Marianne was told she missed jury duty and owed $7,500. Following fake sheriff’s instructions, she fed the cash into a Coinstar crypto ATM, which instantly converted her money to Bitcoin and sent it straight to scammers. 5. Ohio woman loses life savings in cryptocurrency investment scam An Ohio woman lost her life savings in a cryptocurrency investment scam that defrauded victims of about $4.9 million. The scheme involved 33 identified victims nationwide, with five more accounts under FBI investigation. Did you know? A $243 million Bitcoin heist involving a fake Google call spiraled into a real-world kidnapping plot straight out of a Netflix thriller. 7 Key safety tips every elderly crypto investor should know Elderly investors should follow key safety steps like never sending crypto to strangers, verifying suspicious contacts, enabling two-factor authentication, avoiding public WiFi and discussing large transactions with trusted family before acting. Here are the key safety tips every elderly crypto investor should be aware of: Never send crypto to strangers: If someone you’ve never met in person asks for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, it’s almost certainly a scam. This includes social media , messages on Facebook, emails from supposed tech support or even someone you’ve been chatting with on a dating site. No legitimate person or organization will randomly ask for crypto. If you’re being told, “Send me $500 and I’ll send back $1,000,” you’re being conned. Always assume unsolicited crypto requests are fraudulent. Double-check all contacts: If you get a call, email, or text from a bank, the IRS or even a family member in crisis, don’t respond immediately. Call the official number on your bank card or government website to verify. Use trusted wallets and exchanges only: Stick to platforms with strong security and regulation like Coinbase, Kraken and Binance.US . Avoid apps from unknown websites or links in emails. Watch for pressure tactics: Scammers thrive on urgency; you only have two hours to pay; act now to claim your prize. Real financial institutions do not use this kind of pressure. Set up two-factor authentication (2FA): All crypto wallets and exchange accounts should have 2FA enabled. This adds a second layer of protection even if a password is stolen. Avoid public WiFi for crypto transactions: Never send crypto or log in to financial apps over public WiFi at coffee shops, airports or hotels. These networks are often unsecured and can be intercepted by hackers. Use your home WiFi or mobile data instead, and ensure your device has up-to-date antivirus protection. Talk to family before big transactions: Before sending large amounts of crypto or any money, have a quick conversation with someone you trust. Scammers often isolate victims and make them feel they must act alone. Encourage seniors to adopt a simple rule: If it’s more than $100, talk to someone first. A five-minute phone call could prevent a five-figure mistake. Think grandma got scammed? Here’s what to do immediately If you’ve been scammed, act fast: Report it to the crypto exchange (they might freeze the funds ), file a fraud report with the FTC or Chainabuse and contact elder support services for guidance and protection. 1. Report the scam to the exchange If the funds were sent through Coinbase, Binance or another exchange, contact them right away. Some may be able to freeze accounts if action is taken quickly. 2. File a report with law enforcement and the FTC Call your local police department. Report fraud to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov. You can also report crypto fraud at Chainabuse.com, a trusted crypto crime reporting platform. 3. Contact elder support resources ElderCare Locator (USA): Connects older adults and families to local services, including Adult Protective Services for financial exploitation cases. Action Fraud (UK): The UK’s national fraud reporting center for scams, including those involving crypto. Scamwatch, ACCC (Australia): Provides scam alerts and allows reporting of cryptocurrency and financial scams affecting seniors. Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (Canada): A national agency for reporting and tracking fraud, including crypto scams targeting older adults. National Council on Aging – NCOA (US): Offers educational resources and scam prevention tools for seniors and caregivers. Age UK (UK): Provides advice and support for older people facing financial abuse, including online and crypto scams. Did you know? Hackers have been caught selling counterfeit smartphones infected with the Triada Trojan, malware that steals crypto and sensitive data by deeply embedding itself in the device’s system. Is crypto safe for seniors? Yes, but only with proper education and safeguards. Cryptocurrency can be empowering, offering independence and investment opportunities. However, seniors can become easy targets without a strong awareness of the risks. Scammers increasingly target seniors through sophisticated tactics like fake investment platforms, romance scams and impersonation of government or tech support personnel. These schemes often involve urgent demands, emotional manipulation or unfamiliar technologies like crypto ATMs. To minimize risk, seniors should be educated on the basics of cryptocurrency, recognize common fraud tactics, use reputable platforms and involve trusted family or advisers before making transactions. Awareness and vigilance are essential to protect both assets and peace of mind in the digital age. As crypto continues to go mainstream, scammers are adapting fast. Don’t let your loved ones get rug-pulled or emotionally manipulated into losing everything. Share these tips. Stay involved. And when in doubt, always verify before sending funds.",cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/elderly-crypto-investors-are-getting-scammed-teach-them-these-key-safety-tips?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION","investors",cryptocompare

Tariffs and geopolitical concerns remain top of investors’ minds, a scenario that has stocks looking to knit together another winning streak. Ahead of Nvidia’s (NVDA) highly anticipated earnings release after the bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened 56 points higher, while the S&P 500 rose 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.26%. Stocks traded largely unchanged from Tuesday levels, as investor sentiment was influenced by trade dynamics, U.S. economic data, and the global geopolitical outlook. Adding to the caution is the market’s close attention to what the global chipmaker reveals in its upcoming earnings report. Wall Street is expected to use Nvidia’s results and guidance as a gauge for the current tariff landscape and to assess how Big Tech is preparing for potential economic impacts. If Nvidia delivers better-than-expected numbers, the broader market could respond with a sharp upside move. You might also like: Dow Jones inches lower, Nvidia jumps on Trump’s deals with Saudi Arabia But while stocks are likely to see some notable volatility in the short term amid trade deals and other factors, market experts warn the long-term picture may yet point to fresh carnage. According to Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, key long-term indicators signal the stock market may yet dip to new lows. Stockton shared her outlook in an interview with CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ on Wednesday. Other than focus on Nvidia, investors will be keen on minutes from May 2025’s Federal Reserve’s meeting. Elsewhere in the market, shares of video game company GameStop soared after the company announced it had officially purchased 4,710 Bitcoin ( BTC ) for over $500 million. While the move had been anticipated in recent weeks, the purchase reinforces a broadly bullish sentiment toward Bitcoin. Trump Media recently announced it would allocate $2.5 billion raised through an offering to buy BTC, while Strategy, already holding over $40 billion in the digital asset, has signaled plans to acquire more. Bitcoin’s price hovered around $108,000 as U.S. stock markets opened on Wednesday.

Top XRP Experts Think So appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a world where symbols often speak louder than words, a recent post by Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse praising the “Skull of Satoshi” has sparked an unexpected reaction. While Ripple’s gesture of donating the Skull of Satoshi to the Bitcoin community seemed like a peace offering, analyst Ashley PROSPER saw something darker. Her response hints at a deeper concern around Bitcoin’s long-term security, government actions, and rising unease. A Symbol of Unity — Or a Sign of Trouble? In a recent tweet post, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse talked about the famous Skull of Satoshi, a sculpture that started as a symbol of criticism toward Bitcoin’s energy usage. But over time, it has become a sign of Bitcoin’s endurance. Garlinghouse said that as blockchain technology matures, it’s time for different crypto communities — like BTC, XRP, and others — to work together.

2025-05-28T14:10:21.000Z,"Bitcoin Price: Crucial Support Levels Emerge Amid Consolidation","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price: Crucial Support Levels Emerge Amid Consolidation The cryptocurrency market is currently witnessing a fascinating phase for the king of digital assets, Bitcoin (BTC). After a significant run-up, the Bitcoin price is now consolidating, hovering above the psychological $100,000 mark. This period of sideways movement often precedes a larger move, making it a critical time for investors and traders to understand the underlying dynamics. Understanding the Current BTC Price Action Consolidation is a market phase where the asset’s price trades within a relatively narrow range, indicating a balance between buying and selling pressure. For BTC price , this period above $100,000 suggests that despite reaching a major milestone, the market is taking a breath, digesting recent gains, and perhaps accumulating energy for the next directional move. This is a stark contrast to rapid parabolic rises or sharp corrections, pointing towards a more mature market structure developing around these higher price levels. Several factors contribute to this consolidation: Profit-Taking: Some investors who bought at lower prices are likely taking profits. New Entrants: Buyers are stepping in at the $100,000+ level, seeing it as a potential new floor. Market Uncertainty: Global macroeconomic factors and regulatory news can cause hesitation. Whale Activity: Large holders (whales) often play a significant role during consolidation phases, either accumulating or distributing. Observing how long this consolidation phase lasts and the volume associated with it can offer clues about the market’s conviction for the next move. Identifying Key Bitcoin Support Levels In any market, identifying reliable support levels is crucial for understanding where price declines might pause or reverse. According to analysis highlighted by Cointelegraph and insights from analysts like Keith Alan, a significant Bitcoin support level is potentially forming around the $94,000 area. This level isn’t arbitrary; it aligns closely with a key technical indicator: the 21-week moving average. The 21-week moving average is often watched by long-term investors and traders as it can represent a dynamic support or resistance line over medium-term trends. A retest of this level, should a correction occur from the current consolidation range, would be a key test for the bullish structure. Holding this level would reinforce its significance as a strong floor, potentially providing a springboard for future price appreciation. Why is $94,000 important? Alignment with 21-Week MA: This technical indicator is a widely followed benchmark for trend health. Previous Price Action: Often, round numbers or previous resistance levels can turn into support. Psychological Importance: While not a round number like $100K, $94K represents a notable dip that might attract buyers looking for a discount. While $94,000 is a prominent level, traders should also be aware of potential minor support zones within the current consolidation range, which could offer temporary bounces even if the price heads towards the 21-week MA. Navigating Bitcoin Resistance Levels Just as support levels indicate potential floors, resistance levels highlight areas where selling pressure is expected to be strong, potentially capping upward price movement. For the current market structure, the analysis points to the $112,000 level as holding the highest concentration of selling pressure. This means that as the Bitcoin price approaches this mark, a significant number of market participants are likely placing sell orders, either to take profits or enter short positions. Breaking through a strong resistance level like $112,000 typically requires substantial buying volume and market conviction. A failed attempt to break resistance can lead to a price pullback, potentially back towards the consolidation range or even towards the identified support levels. Key Resistance Points: $112,000: Identified as a major hurdle due to high selling pressure. Above $112,000: Subsequent resistance could be found at historical highs or based on Fibonacci extension levels. Psychological Levels: Round numbers above $112K (e.g., $120K, $125K) can also act as minor resistance. Successfully clearing the $112,000 resistance would be a strong bullish signal, potentially opening the door for a move towards new all-time highs. The Influence of BTC Whales on Market Dynamics The actions of large holders, often referred to as ‘whales’, have a disproportionate impact on the cryptocurrency market due to their sheer volume of assets. The observation that whales are increasing their holdings during this consolidation phase is a noteworthy point from the Cointelegraph report. This accumulation could be interpreted as a bullish sign, suggesting that these large players anticipate higher prices in the future and are using the current sideways movement to build their positions without causing significant price spikes. However, whale activity is a double-edged sword. While accumulation can signal confidence, whales can also quickly sell large portions of their holdings, leading to sharp price drops. Furthermore, leveraged trades by large entities, like those mentioned regarding James Wynn, can amplify market movements. High leverage means even small price changes can lead to liquidations, which can cascade and trigger larger volatility events. Understanding whale behavior is a key component of effective Bitcoin market analysis . On-chain data analysis tools often track the movements of wallets holding significant amounts of BTC, providing insights into whether these large players are primarily in accumulation or distribution mode. Actionable Insights from Bitcoin Market Analysis Given the current market structure and the factors at play, what are the actionable insights for those involved in the Bitcoin market? Monitor Key Levels: Keep a close watch on the $100,000 consolidation range, the $94,000 potential support, and the $112,000 resistance. Price action around these levels will be highly informative. Understand Consolidation: Recognize that consolidation can resolve in either direction. It’s a period of indecision before a potential breakout or breakdown. Consider Whale Activity: While not a guaranteed predictor, whale accumulation during consolidation can be a positive sign. However, remain cautious of potential volatility from large trades. Use Risk Management: Given the potential for sharp moves out of consolidation, employing strategies like stop-loss orders is crucial to protect capital. Stay Informed: Keep up with fundamental news, macroeconomic trends, and technical analysis updates that could influence the market. This period requires patience and careful observation rather than impulsive trading based on minor price fluctuations within the range. Challenges and Considerations Despite the potential for identifying clear support and resistance, the crypto market is inherently volatile. Unexpected news events, shifts in global sentiment, or large liquidation cascades triggered by leveraged positions can cause rapid deviations from expected price movements. Therefore, relying solely on technical levels without considering the broader market context and risk management principles is not advisable. Conclusion: What’s Next for Bitcoin? The current phase of consolidation above $100,000 is a pivotal moment for the Bitcoin price . The presence of significant potential support around $94,000, near the 21-week moving average, offers a key level to watch should a pullback occur. Conversely, the $112,000 level represents a major resistance hurdle that needs to be overcome for the uptrend to continue with conviction. The backdrop of whale accumulation adds an intriguing layer to the Bitcoin market analysis , potentially signaling underlying strength, but the risk of volatility from large players and leveraged positions remains. Ultimately, the resolution of this consolidation phase will likely dictate Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory. Whether it’s a bullish breakout above $112,000 or a retest of the crucial $94,000 support, staying informed and prepared for volatility is key in this exciting market.

2025-05-28T14:00:32.000Z,"Russia peddles Europe-sanctioned excess energy to crypto miners","Russian crypto miners can use natural gas, in excess since Europe started cutting energy purchases from Russia, to mint digital coins, a government official has suggested. The proposal comes after the presentation of a roadmap in Brussels meant to steer the European Union away from Russian gas, oil and nuclear fuel imports in the coming years. Natural gas should power crypto mining in the Far East, minister says Natural gas, of which Russia has surplus quantities since it started losing European markets, can be utilized to power cryptocurrency mining operations, according to Aleksey Chekunkov, head of Russia’s Ministry for the Development of the Far East and the Arctic. Quoted by the Tass news agency, Chekunkov insisted mining farms should not tap into the electricity distributed to businesses and households. Speaking to reporters in the city of Khabarovsk, administrative center of the Far Eastern Federal District, the minister elaborated: “You can mine using your own resources, using gas. We have a lot of gas that we used to sell to Europe. Now it’s in the ground. Please, install power plants and mine.” The expanding crypto mining industry, which Moscow legalized and regulated last year, has been blamed for energy shortages in a number of Russian regions, including Russia’s “ mining capital ,” Irkutsk Oblast. A ban on mining in parts of the country, which began as a seasonal measure during the cold winter months, has grown into a permanent prohibition in about a dozen territories, including the Russian republics in the Caucasus and the occupied lands of Ukraine. On June 4, a government commission will consider proposals to introduce a year-round mining ban in another five regions facing power deficits – Transbaikal, Buryatia, northern Karelia, the Penza region, and parts of Khakassia. Meanwhile, Russian Deputy Minister of Energy Evgeny Grabchak revealed last week that the federal government may ask crypto miners to move to the north of the country. The idea is to utilize currently idle generation capacities and transmission infrastructure, including at depleted oil fields. Europe speeds up plan to end dependence on Russian energy The proposal to power Bitcoin mining farms with excess natural gas in Russia comes after the recent adoption of a roadmap in Brussels to completely eliminate the EU’s dependency on Russian energy within a couple of years. The document was presented on May 6, around the third anniversary of the approval of a plan to phase out Russian fossil fuels. The latter was published just two weeks after Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February 2022. War-related sanctions have led to a significant reduction in energy imports from the Russian Federation over the course of the past three years, Euronews noted in a report this week. The broadcaster detailed: “Oil fell from 27% in 2022 to 3% in 2025, gas fell from 45% to 19% in the same period and coal, which at the time accounted for 50% of EU consumption, stopped entering the EU altogether.” However, the European Commission admitted that “despite the significant progress achieved under the REPowerEU plan , and via 16 sanction packages introduced since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the EU saw a rebound in Russian gas imports in 2024.” Its new REPowerEU roadmap now pushes for a “coordinated, secure and gradual phase out of Russian gas, oil and nuclear energy imports.” It sets a clear target – to end Russian gas imports to the European Union by 2027 and requires member states to submit national plans to reach the goal. Last year, 10 EU countries imported 52 billion cubic meters of Russian natural gas, three bought 13 million tonnes of oil and seven member states acquired 2,800 tonnes of enriched uranium and nuclear fuel, the Commission’s stats show. Russian energy exports to the EU returned €23 billion to Moscow in 2024. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

2025-05-28T14:00:03.000Z,"XRP Holds Midline Support That Has Led To Breakout In The Past, Why $2.9 Could Be Next","The XRP price has shown a lot of strength recently, and through the weekend drawdown, it did not break support at $2. This has shown that the bulls have completely taken control at this point, providing the backup needed to properly surge from here. As the consolidation has continued, the XRP price has been forming a bullish channel structure. A break from here is growing more likely, and new monthly peaks would be the result. XRP Price Holds Channel Structure Crypto analyst VIPROSE has pointed out an interesting structure that has formed on the XRP price chart, which it continues to hold. The altcoin’s price has been trending inside a rising channel that formed with the market decline. In addition to this, the altcoin has also managed to hold the midline support at the 0.618 Fibonacci level, which is very bullish for the price. The reason for this is the fact that the 0.618 Fibonacci level has always been a point of bullish recovery for the XRP price in the past. As the crypto analyst explained, it has frequently acted as a launchpad and holding at this level has always provided support for a strong upward move. Thus, as the XRP price continues to hold here, it is likely that it will be a bounce-off point for further price recovery. The bullish channel that has formed is especially important, given the fact that bulls have already established strong support. From here, it is more likely that the XRP price would move to test resistance levels at the upper ends rather than suffer a decline to retest support levels. Firstly, the XRP price would need to clear $2.4 , which has been showing the most resistance, as seen from last week’s rise and subsequent bearish trend. The analyst suggests that as long as the price holds the key support levels at $2.18-$2.22, which are aligned with the important 0.618 and 0.786 Fibonacci levels, then the next step is a bullish continuation. How High Can The Price Go? If the bullish continuation is confirmed, the XRP price is expected to keep rising from here. An at least 10% move for a start as a trend resumption is confirmed is likely. As the uptrend continues, the altcoin’s price is expected to move toward its peaks from January. The crypto analyst explains that based on the projected move of the height of the channel structure, a break from here would put the XRP price as high as $2.9206 . This would be an over 20% move and the first step toward testing new all-time highs. “Watch for volume confirmation on the bounce — the setup remains valid as long as XRP stays above key support,” the analyst concluded.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-holds-midline-support-2-9/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","XRP|crypto|crypto news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-05-28T14:00:00.000Z,"How to mine Bitcoin at home in 2025","Key takeaways Lottery mining is cheap and fun, but don’t count on hitting a block. Solo ASIC mining gives you complete control, but it’s a long-odds game. Pool mining is the most practical way to earn steady payouts at home. Cloud mining saves you the hassle but usually isn’t worth the cost. Bitcoin is rapidly gaining legitimacy, and you couldn’t be blamed for wanting to peek behind the curtain to see how it’s made. Throughout 2024 and into 2025, you've seen a whirlwind of institutional investment from companies like Strategy , which continues to aggressively accumulate Bitcoin ( BTC ), and Metaplanet, Japan’s listed company that recently adopted BTC as a treasury reserve asset. Moreover, on the regulatory front, the return of a US President Donald Trump administration signals a friendlier stance toward crypto, with talk of rolling back SEC overreach and possibly supporting US-based mining . Across the Atlantic, the MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation has gone into effect in the EU, offering clearer guidelines and reducing regulatory uncertainty for retail investors and miners alike. Then there's the price. Bitcoin finally broke the long-anticipated $100,000 resistance level in early 2025, following a post-halving supply shock and increased ETF-driven demand. As institutions pour in and supply tightens, more individuals are re-evaluating how to get involved. Whatever your motivation, one thing’s certain: You want to mine from the comfort of your home. This article will explain four realistic ways to mine Bitcoin at home in 2025, what gear you’ll need, how much it might cost, and what kind of returns you can expect. Did you know? Bitcoin mining has developed into a sizable industry, with revenues growing by over 6,700% from 2021 to 2025. Option 1: Lottery mining – Low power, high risk, rare rewards If you’re working with a limited budget but still want to try Bitcoin mining, lottery mining offers an interesting — if highly unpredictable — way. In July 2024, a solo miner using just three TH/s of hash power — roughly what you’d get from two small USB devices — successfully mined an entire Bitcoin block. The reward was 3.192 BTC, worth over $200,000 at the time. Statistically, that kind of result should take thousands of years. But with some luck and help from the Solo CKPool platform, it actually happened. These wins are extremely rare, but they do happen. And that’s what keeps some people interested. Most lottery miners use small, low-power devices like the Bitaxe HEX, an open-source miner built with actual Antminer chips. It runs at around three TH/s, costs about $600 and pairs easily with a Raspberry Pi. Another popular option is the GekkoScience R909, a USB miner running at 1.5 TH/s and a favorite among hobbyists. These devices aren’t built for steady income. They’re closer to digital slot machines, but ones that still contribute to securing the Bitcoin network . So why do people do it? Three main reasons: Running an independent node supports the health and resilience of the Bitcoin network. It’s a good way to get familiar with how mining works . A single successful block can be worth a lot, and it’s all yours if it happens. For most, it’s not about making money. It’s about the challenge and the curiosity, like building a custom PC or restoring a vintage radio. And yes, it also looks great plugged in on a shelf, blinking quietly under a glowing Bitcoin lamp. Next up: ASICs, the heavy-duty hardware of serious miners. Did you know? Solo CKPool is designed for independent miners who want to submit their shares directly to the Bitcoin network. Unlike traditional mining pools, if you’re successful here, the entire reward goes to you (minus a small pool fee). There’s no revenue sharing, no splitting blocks. Option 2: ASIC mining – Solo mining with real hardware If lottery mining is like buying a single ticket and hoping for a lucky break, solo mining with an ASIC is showing up with a small stack. Your chances improve, but it’s still a long shot. ASICs — application-specific integrated circuits — are purpose-built for Bitcoin mining. In 2025, high-end models like the Antminer S21 Hydro deliver impressive performances, reaching around 400 terahashes per second with improved energy efficiency over previous generations. Let’s look at the numbers. The Bitcoin network currently runs at around 500 exahashes per second. With one S21 Hydro, you’d control roughly 0.00008% of the total hashrate . That gives you odds of about one in 8.6 billion of finding a block on any given day. It's still extremely unlikely, but it's far better than what you’d get with low-power USB miners. To meaningfully improve your chances, you’d need to scale up. Running 20 ASICs could put you past eight petahashes per second, enough, in theory, to find a block about once a year. But that setup requires significant capital, proper ventilation or immersion cooling and a reliable energy supply. Even then, outcomes are unpredictable. The Bitcoin network might find several blocks in an hour or none at all. Still, some miners go this route. The appeal is simple: If you do find a block on your own, you keep the entire reward , currently over three BTC, plus transaction fees . There is no need to split the payout with anyone else. But for most people, even those with top-tier ASICs, solo mining remains a high-risk approach with uncertain rewards. Did you know? The cost of the latest mining equipment has significantly decreased, with prices around $16 per terahash in 2025, compared to $80 per terahash in 2022, enhancing mining efficiency. That’s why many home miners eventually turn to a more consistent and scalable model: Joining a mining pool. Option 3: Pool mining – Strength in numbers If solo mining is a long shot, pool mining is the practical alternative. It’s how most home miners approach Bitcoin mining in 2025 – and with good reason. By joining a mining pool , you combine your hashrate with thousands of other participants. When the pool successfully mines a block, the reward is split based on each miner’s contribution. You’re no longer chasing a rare solo win, but earning smaller, steady payouts. It’s more predictable, less risky and not so dependent on luck. For example, if you’re running an Antminer S21 Hydro at 400 TH/s, that hash power earns you a proportional share of the pool’s rewards. You’ll likely see consistent daily income tied directly to your contribution. The largest pools today — Foundry USA, Antpool, ViaBTC, F2Pool — handle thousands of blocks every month. Many offer FPPS (Full Pay Per Share) models, where you’re paid for every valid share you submit, regardless of whether a block is found that day. Others use PPLNS (Pay Per Last N Shares), which only pays out when a block is discovered, but can result in slightly higher returns over time. The choice depends on how much payout fluctuation you're comfortable with. Setting things up is straightforward: Create an account with your chosen pool. Point your ASIC miner to the pool’s server. Add your Bitcoin payout address. Monitor your stats from the pool’s web dashboard. The returns won’t be massive, but they’ll be consistent, and for many miners, that’s exactly the goal. But what if you want to skip the hardware, the setup and the electricity costs altogether? What if you want exposure to mining without running a machine? That’s where cloud mining comes in. Option 4: Cloud mining – Mining without the machines Cloud mining lets you rent hash power from a remote provider, who runs the hardware on your behalf. You don’t have to manage equipment, deal with heat or noise, or worry about electricity costs. You simply buy a contract, and if all goes well, you will receive a portion of the mining rewards. On paper, it sounds straightforward. You select a provider, choose how much hash power you want to rent, and pay either upfront or through a subscription. The provider takes care of the infrastructure, including maintenance and cooling. In return, you earn a share of the Bitcoin mined, proportional to your rented power. But there are trade-offs – and risks. Cloud mining has gained a mixed reputation. Over the years, the space has been flooded with questionable operators, unrealistic return promises and outright scams. Many contracts turn out to be unprofitable once you factor in service fees, maintenance costs and the increasing difficulty of mining . You're effectively trusting a third party to operate machines you'll never see. That said, there are a few reputable providers. Platforms like NiceHash, BitDeer and ECOS have remained active in the space and offer flexible, transparent options. Some let you choose specific coins or pools. Still, even with these more established names, margins tend to be very thin, especially during bear markets or when global hashrates spike. Cloud mining may be worth considering if: You have limited access to cheap electricity or space for equipment. You’re looking for a low-effort way to get exposure to mining. You view it more as a speculative bet than a reliable income stream. However, if your goal is consistent returns or hands-on experience, then running your own gear or just buying and holding Bitcoin is likely a better use of resources. The bottom line There’s no single right way to mine Bitcoin at home in 2025. It comes down to what you’re after. Lottery mining is fun and cheap, but the odds are long. Going solo with an ASIC gives you full control and full risk. Mining pools are the go-to for steady, reliable payouts. Cloud mining offers convenience but not much certainty. If you're in it for the learning, the experience, or to slowly stack sats over time, there’s a setup that’ll fit. Just know what you’re getting into and why you’re doing it.",cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-mine-bitcoin-at-home?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","Mine bitcoin",cryptocompare

Here Are the Details","Tokyo-based technology company Metaplanet has made a new move in its aggressive Bitcoin investment strategy. The company announced the issuance of $50 million in zero-interest bonds. With this funding, the company plans to increase its Bitcoin (BTC) purchases. Metaplanet Issues $50 Million in Bonds to Increase Bitcoin Purchases This bond issuance is Metaplanet's 16th bond sale to date, according to the company's announcement in Japan on May 28, 2025. The bonds were all purchased by Cayman Islands-based investment firm Evo Fund, which has participated in Metaplanet’s previous bond sales and is one of the main institutional partners supporting the company’s long-term Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Following the bond issuance news, Metaplanet shares rose by 9.5% on the Japanese stock exchange. According to Yahoo Finance data, this increase reflects the company’s confidence in its BTC-focused strategy among investors. Metaplanet has been accumulating Bitcoin since April 2024 and aims to reach 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025. Last week, the company announced that it had purchased an additional 1,004 BTC for approximately $104 million. With this latest purchase, the firm’s total BTC holdings reached 7,800. Metaplanet’s new funding move comes as Bitcoin is trading near all-time highs. Last week, BTC rose to $111,889 on exchanges like Coinbase. At press time, BTC was trading sideways at $108,870. In the crypto markets, Metaplanet is often compared to US software company MicroStrategy for its aggressive BTC investment model. The company is the public company holding the most BTC in Asia and ranks 11th globally, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net data. *This is not investment advice.

GameStop officially confirms first Bitcoin purchase of 4,710 BTC GameStop, the US video game and consumer electronics retailer, has confirmed its first Bitcoin investment , acquiring 4,710 Bitcoin, according to a statement posted May 28 on the company’s X account. The company did not specify how much it paid for the Bitcoin ( BTC ) or when the purchases were made in the announcement , while its Form 8-K filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission also offers little detail. The amount purchased was worth around $513 million at the time of writing. The announced acquisition is GameStop's first publicly acknowledged Bitcoin purchase since the company disclosed plans to move into Bitcoin investment in March. At the time, GameStop said it would fund the Bitcoin purchase through debt financing and launched a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering.

Steil wants restraint on crypto bill additions Republican Representative Bryan Steil told Cointelegraph on May 27 that he wants lawmakers to stop adding what he considers are non-relevant clauses into two key crypto bills, claiming that doing so is slowing the implementation of a regulatory framework for the industry. “Individuals, when they see legislation that’s going to move forward, want to attach non-germane items to any bill that’s going to move through and be signed into law,” Steil, chair of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on crypto, told Cointelegraph at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas.

Crypto backers in Congress hope to pass stablecoin and market structure bills before a month-long August recess, which was hampered by Democrats who pulled support for the stablecoin bill earlier in May over concerns about President Donald Trump’s crypto ventures. Steil argued the concerns related to Trump aren’t relevant to the bills, and the “text is focused on putting forward a regulatory framework in which we can enforce actions to strengthen this broader market.” Trump Media Group reverses stance, confirms $2.5 billion Bitcoin capital raise Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), the company that owns US President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform and is partially owned by the president, confirmed a $2.5 billion capital raise to purchase Bitcoin after denying earlier reports of the deal. According to a May 27 announcement from the company, the capital raise comprises a $1.5 billion stock sale and $1 billion in convertible senior secured bonds, with a 0% coupon. The sale is expected to close on May 29. TMTG CEO Devin Nunes said: “We view Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets. This investment will help defend our Company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions.\"" TMTG spokespeople responded to the initial report from the Financial Times, published a day before the announcement, with derision. “Apparently, the Financial Times has dumb writers listening to even dumber sources,” TMTG representatives told the FT on May 26.",cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-happened-in-crypto-today?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|LINK|LTC|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BNB|FDUSD|TON|USDC|ENA|BSV|ZK|WLD|OM|KAVA|BTG|ARKM","Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

Tom Lee Says the “Banana Zone” Is Coming appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is trading near $108,914.72 ( check live ), and the excitement is building. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee has made a bold prediction – he believes Bitcoin is heading toward $150,000 in this market cycle. Lee says Bitcoin is about to enter a “banana zone” – a phase of rapid price growth that could reshape the crypto market in 2025. So, what’s behind this bold forecast? Let’s break it down. What Is the “Banana Zone”? Lee’s outlook is based on an analysis shared by Julien Bittel , head of macro research at Global Macro Investor. Bittel’s chart tracks four major Bitcoin market cycles since 2011. Each cycle included two correction phases before entering a fast-growth period – what they call the “banana zone.” According to the chart, the current cycle began in 2022 and is now going through its first correction. If the pattern holds, Bitcoin could be gearing up for a major rally. This theory is already gaining traction. On May 22, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $111,970 after the U.S. and China agreed to a 30-day trade war truce. Although the price later dropped to $78,000 due to institutional sell-offs, Lee sees that as part of the natural cycle and a setup for bigger gains ahead. Tom Lee’s Bold Forecast: $150K Is in Sight Speaking to CNBC earlier this year, Lee said he expects Bitcoin to pull back to $50,000–$60,000 before continuing its climb. He believes BTC could hit $150,000 in this market cycle. He also thinks Bitcoin could eventually rival gold as a top store of value, especially with growing interest from institutions. Adding more fuel to the fire, analyst Nick Hellmann recently predicted that Bitcoin could break $244,00, reminding his followers that he previously called the $100K mark correctly. Michael Saylor Embraces Bitcoin for Everyday Use At the Bitcoin 2025 conference, MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor made waves again. He met with Gemini founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who handed him the new Gemini Bitcoin Credit Card. Saylor posted a photo of the moment on X, captioned: “Bitcoin is money. Everything else is credit.” The credit card offers Bitcoin rewards on fiat purchases, aiming to make BTC part of everyday spending. Tyler Winklevoss even mentioned that the card includes a “ whale limit ” – a nod to MicroStrategy’s massive Bitcoin holdings Crypto’s Next Chapter: Are We There Yet? From bullish predictions to new tools for BTC adoption, momentum is building fast. With growing institutional interest, a more supportive U.S. government, and signs of a broader trend shift, Bitcoin could be heading into one of its biggest years yet.

2025-05-28T13:45:37.000Z,"Why MicroStrategy Slows Down Its Bitcoin Purchase?","The post Why MicroStrategy Slows Down Its Bitcoin Purchase? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Strategy, formerly known as (MicroStrategy), the biggest corporate holder of Bitcoin has been long known for buying huge amounts of BTC, leading the way for other companies to join the Bitcoin wave. But in the past few weeks, things have slowed down for Strategy. Why is this happening? Is Strategy starting to lose money? Let’s dive in. Recent Purchases Show a Slower Pace According to K33’s Vetle Lunde, Strategy’s recent purchases are smaller than before. Between May 19 and May 25, the company bought 4,020 bitcoins for about $427 million. They used money from selling new MSTR shares but raised only $348.7 million this time, much less than the $705.7 million they raised the week before. Just a few months ago, they were raising over $2 billion each week to buy Bitcoin! Why Is Strategy Slowing Down? This slowdown has a few reasons. First, the price gap between MSTR’s stock and the actual value of its bitcoin holdings has gotten smaller. That means investors aren’t paying as much extra for MSTR shares anymore, making it harder for the company to raise big sums of money. Second, more companies are now jumping into the Bitcoin game. Over 70 firms, including big names like Metaplanet and Semler Scientific, have started using their treasuries to hold Bitcoin. Just this week, Trump Media and Technology Group also announced it’s holding Bitcoin in its treasury, backed by $2.5 billion from investors. All this new competition is giving people more choices, so MSTR doesn’t have the same edge it once did. Strategy Still Holds a Big Bitcoin Pile Even with the slowdown, Strategy still holds an impressive 580,250 BTC, worth over $63 billion at today’s prices. That’s about 2.75% of all Bitcoin out there! Meanwhile, on May 22, the company shared that it plans to sell its 10% Series A perpetual strife preferred stock for just $0.001 per share. This new sales agreement is expected to bring in a total of $2.1 billion over time through its ATM program. However, the company has recorded a massive $15 billion profit as Bitcoin reaches its highest price ever.

The cryptocurrency exchange will serve as the exclusive crypto exchange and wallet partner for both teams. The announcement comes despite facing challenges from a recent data breach that exposed sensitive information of nearly 70,000 customers and could cost up to $400 million in remediation. Coinbase targets Canadian sports fans through MLSE deal Coinbase has recognized a significant opportunity in the sports industry in Canada. According to recent data the exchange cited, 1.4 million Toronto FC and Argonauts supporters have engaged in active cryptocurrency trading in the previous 12 months, and 1.7 million of them are cryptocurrency owners. It expects to gain direct access to these communities through collaboration with Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment on a number of sports channels. As a result of the partnership, Coinbase is now both teams’ sole cryptocurrency exchange and wallet partner. The new lounge at Toronto’s BMO Field, fieldside LED signs for both teams’ home games, and jersey patches on Toronto Argonauts uniforms will all prominently display the exchange. About five million people in Canada own crypto, making up about 13% of the country’s total population. Because of this, the nation is a desirable market for Coinbase’s growth initiatives. The collaboration expands on Coinbase’s prior achievement as the 111th Grey Cup’s first cryptocurrency partner and the Canadian Football League. Multi-sport branding strategy spans CFL and MLS partnerships The focus of Coinbase’s Canadian expansion is on high-profile branding opportunities on Major League Soccer and the Canadian Football League platforms. Beyond physical branding, Coinbase plans digital activations across both teams’ social media platforms. This includes interactive games and contests designed to educate Canadian audiences about cryptocurrency. The company is also developing immersive fan experiences such as promotional nights and in-game activations. This Canadian sports initiative aligns with Coinbase’s broader athletic partnerships, which include relationships with the NBA, Aston Martin Aramco Formula One racing, and esports partnerships with Riot Games. The Toronto-focused partnerships are the latest steps in what Coinbase describes as bringing sports on-chain while connecting with established Canadian institutions. Financial implications of data breach still on the horizon Coinbase’s move into Canada comes on the heels of the exchange being in serious financial and reputational peril following a massive data breach that began in late December 2024 and was announced in May 2025. The breach exposed sensitive financial information and personal information of nearly 70,000 customers. This includes phone numbers, addresses, email, and masked Social Security numbers. The stolen data also included masked banking account numbers, government identification photos such as driver’s licenses and passports, account balances, and transaction records. Coinbase declined to pay the requested $20 million ransom to the attackers. Instead, it offered a $20 million reward for information pointing towards the arrest and conviction of the attackers. The firm is also working with law enforcement officials, such as the U.S. Department of Justice, who have begun an investigation into the hack. Coinbase has committed to refunding those customers who were tricked into sending money to attackers as a direct result of the hack.

However, the pullback appears to be yet another higher low, which keeps up the possibility of a breakout. In the past few days, institutions have been aggressively accumulating Bitcoin, while others have been raising funds to buy more, such as Statergy. With the bullish momentum refueling, the Bitcoin cohorts have again become active. The Bitcoin cohorts refer to groups within the network that are used to understand the trend patterns and economic behaviors related to BTC transactions. Woefully, the spending by the older BTC holders has hit a high. The Aggregate volume of 1-year to 5-year cohorts has surged above $4 billion, suggesting the older coins are on the move. The rise has been seen for the first time since February 2025, while the 3-year to 5-year cohort contributed $2.16 billion out of $4 billion, which is their second-largest outflow. While 2-3 cohorts and 1-2 years contribute $1.41 billion and $450 million, respectively. In recent times, the change in their positions has always triggered interim BTC peaks, be it in Q4 2024 or in February or May 2025. Now the question arises whether this is a bearish signal for Bitcoin. Seeing 1y to 5y BTC moving isn’t a red flag yet, as most of this appears to be institutional accumulation, but not actual dumping. The exchange netflows are negative, while ETF inflows sharply rise, indicating they could be buying. However, if these tokens hit the exchanges, one can expect a sharp move.

Adam Back says Bitcoin tops $1 million if US jumps in Blockstream CEO Adam Back said in November that Bitcoin could break $1 million “this cycle” if the US follows through with plans to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. In March, the White House did just that, though it has yet to be codified into law by Congress. The Bitcoin Reserve Act treats the world’s first blockchain-based cryptocurrency as a digital gold-style reserve asset, using coins seized from criminal cases. Back says the $1 million prediction is the minimum target if the stars align. Source: Adam Back US states have started laying the groundwork. New Hampshire broke the ice on May 6 by signing a Bitcoin reserve bill into law. Later in the month, Texas lawmakers advanced a bill to establish a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, backed by Governor Greg Abbott . Speaking with Cointelegraph Magazine , Back gave a 2025 price target of “a few hundred thousand” dollars, citing renewed retail demand once roughly $16 billion in FTX bankruptcy repayments re-enter the market. He added that he is confident many of those investors will cycle back into the crypto market to fuel the next big rally. 2. Smart money agrees on Bitcoin’s year-end target Several analysts have set $200,000 as their target for Bitcoin in 2025. Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets at Standard Chartered, has been one of the leading voices. Kendrick said in an email note seen by Cointelegraph that Bitcoin is expected to hit $120,000 in the first half of 2025 en route to $200,000 by year-end, fueled by the rise of stablecoins. Related: A Bitcoiner’s guide to South Africa’s Garden Route “The US Senate… voted 66-32 to advance the GENIUS Act,” Kendrick wrote in the email note. “The point of the stablecoin Act is that stablecoins will further legitimise the whole asset class. All boats will rise.” Standard Chartered is closely watching the growth of stablecoins as a potential catalyst for Bitcoin’s price rise. Source: Standard Chartered Research During a recent Chain Reaction X Spaces show hosted by Cointelegraph, other analysts weighed in with their 2025 outlooks. André Dragosch, head of European research at Bitwise, agreed with Kendrick’s $200,000 year-end target. Markus Thielen added that Bitcoin has historically moved in $16,000 price increments, placing its next key resistance around $122,000. Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital and former White House communications director, also recently set his year-end target at $200,000 in a media interview . 3.

Cathie Wood’s $1.5-million Bitcoin target Cathie Wood, CEO and chief investment officer of ARK Invest, set her bull case forecast for Bitcoin at $1.5 million by 2030 , which would require a compound annual growth rate of 58% over the next five years. In a YouTube video published in February, she cited rising institutional interest as the key driver.

2025-05-28T13:30:26.000Z,"Bitcoin Represents A False Hope And Regulatory Concerns For Trump Media & Technology Group","Summary Trump Media's $2.5B capital raise to buy Bitcoin doesn't address core business weaknesses or create lasting shareholder value. Management's plan to classify Bitcoin as cash or short-term investments violates GAAP and raises legal and accounting red flags. Shares remain extremely overvalued relative to peers, with user growth and monetization failing to justify the current market cap. Absent a massive Bitcoin rally, I see no upside for shareholders and maintain a 'strong sell' rating on DJT. May 27th was not a very good day for shareholders of Trump Media & Technology Group ( DJT ), the company that owns right-wing platform Truth Social. After news broke that management had decided to issue additional stock and convertible notes, shares of the business closed down 10.4%. Even though this transaction will bring a significant amount of liquidity to the company, it doesn't do anything to address its underlying problems. The objective is to use this cash to invest in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). This could work out well in the event that Bitcoin prices rise. But anybody who follows my work closely knows how bearish I am about that cryptocurrency. There are some other issues as well. For starters, management seems to be interested in classifying these Bitcoin holdings on the company's books in a way that currently violates accounting standards and would be at odds with the law. This is problematic in and of itself. On top of this, shares of Trump Media & Technology Group remain significantly overvalued as-is and are likely to fall further from where they are right now. For context, since I originally rated the company a ‘strong sell’ in April 2024, the stock has plummeted by 52.1%. That comes at a time when the S&P 500 is up 12.9%. Absent any scenario where Bitcoin prices skyrocket, I see this as just more noise and more evidence that management doesn't really have a solid strategy to grow the company and create lasting shareholder value. Due to these factors, I have no choice but to maintain the company as a ‘strong sell’. A big… and questionable… announcement Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group plummeted 10.4% on May 27th after management announced that it struck a deal to raise about $2.5 billion from a group of 50 institutional investors. This investment will take two forms. The largest chunk of the money, $1.5 billion, will come from the issuance of additional stock at a price of $25.72 per share. This implies 58.32 million shares, which on their own would dilute existing shareholders by 20.9%. On top of this, the firm is issuing another $1 billion of 0% convertible notes. These are senior secured notes that will be backed by the Bitcoin holdings that the company has on its books. There is the opportunity for the notes to be converted at a 35% premium to the price that the shares are being sold for. That would mean an effective price of $34.72 per share. If that comes to pass, it would mean further dilution because of the issuance of 28.80 million shares. For those who are bullish about Bitcoin, and who are also bullish about Trump Media & Technology Group, this development will be perceived in a positive light. In essence, management will use the proceeds from this transaction to create what it calls a Bitcoin treasury. This follows a previously announced special acquisition fund that I wrote about in the past. According to the press release, Chairman and CEO Devin Nunes said that, ‘We view Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets. Our first acquisition of a crown jewel asset, this investment will help defend our Company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions, which plague many Americans and US firms, and will create synergies for our subscription payments, a utility token, and other planned transactions across Truth Social and Truth+. It's a big step forward in the Company’s plans to evolve into a holding company by acquiring additional profit-generating, crown jewel assets consistent with America First principles’. This transaction really just signals to me that management doesn't really have a cohesive strategy for how to grow the business. The entire objective of the company at this point in time should be to grow its user base and improve monetization. This would result in network effects that could make this into a lasting firm. In my previous article about the company, I specifically mentioned that it seemed as though management was just looking to latch on to anything that might stick, with the hopes that it would turn out well. This sentiment was expressed after the company struck a deal with Crypto.com to speculate in cryptocurrency using ETFs on its Truth.Fi platform. That followed another strategy that involved its own Truth+ streaming operations that have since been launched on Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Android TV, Apple TV, and elsewhere. Obviously, if Bitcoin prices rise from here, there could be a positive outcome for shareholders. However, the company does face some other issues as well that are worth mentioning. The first thing that came to my mind was that the business seems intent on violating current accounting standards. In its press release, the company said that it will place Bitcoin on the company's balance sheet alongside existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. This is a big problem because Bitcoin is not, by definition, any of those things. According to current accounting standards in the US, cash includes currency that a company has, as well as things such as demand deposits with banks or other financial institutions. It can include other types of deposit-related accounts also. It also doesn't meet the definition of a cash equivalent. You see, cash equivalents are short term, highly liquid investments that have specific characteristics to them. For starters, they are ‘readily convertible to known amounts of cash’ and ‘so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates’. An example here would be a three-month U.S. Treasury bill. Even when you have an investment that has a short time remaining to it, if the original maturity was longer, such as three years, it still would not meet the definition of cash equivalent. Some might argue that Bitcoin would meet the cash equivalents definition because it is readily convertible to cash and because it's not really tied to interest rates. However, the highly volatile nature of it violates part of this rule. As such, it certainly wouldn't pass the muster of this test. When it comes to short-term investments, it doesn't meet that standard either . To meet the standard, it must be readily marketable, meaning that it can be sold on the public market quickly and without any meaningful loss from said sale. It must be intended to be converted into cash within a single year or within the company’s operating cycle. And it must meet the definition of a financial instrument, which has historically been a debt security, an equity security, or some sort of held-for-trading, available-for-sale, or held-to-maturity investment. But in order to meet the definition of a financial instrument, it has to give the owner a contractual claim to cash or some other financial asset. Bitcoin does none of that. The proper designation under GAAP regarding Bitcoin and other similar cryptocurrencies has been as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Specific examples here outside of cryptocurrency would be goodwill or trademarks. Each year, these must be tested for impairment. This also means that, should there be a plunge in Bitcoin and a subsequent increase in it, the value of Bitcoin on the company's books could end up being significantly understated. Indefinite lived intangible assets can be written down, or impaired, when their prices drop. But they cannot be adjusted upwards. So this is something investors should pay attention to. It's also worth noting that, under the Howey Test, Bitcoin is not considered a security because it fails two of those four prongs. While it does meet the first prong of involving an investment of money, and it also meets the prong of there being an expectation of buyers having a profit from it, it's not an investment in a common enterprise since there is no issuing entity, and it doesn't involve the efforts of others since it is a decentralized faux asset. The SEC and CFTC typically both recognize Bitcoin as a commodity , not an investment. So at the end of the day, the company is going to have difficulty classifying its investment in the way that it hopes to classify it. I suppose that if management puts the Bitcoin into some other structured entity like an ETF or trust, it might be able to include it under the short-term investments category. But that would only be applicable if the investment is intended to be liquidated in a year or less. In that case, any swings in valuation could be measured at fair value and record it as unrealized gains or losses, until such time that the firm finally cashes out of it and realizes said gains or losses. Shares remain insanely overvalued In my previous article about Trump Media & Technology Group, I also decided to value the company by looking at the implied enterprise value divided by the daily active users that the company has. Since then, I have seen an updated estimate that pegs the number of daily active users for the company at 2 million. That's above the 1.9 million estimate that I used in March of this year. Management doesn't report these figures, so we have to use these third-party estimates. Author - SEC EDGAR Data In that analysis, which you can see updated in the table above, the company is compared to other social platforms that are publicly traded. I have also included Twitter on the list since we know its ultimate value at the time that it was sold. If the company were to trade at the same enterprise value per daily active user as these other firms, you would be looking at a downside of between 50.5% and 63.7%. This is even after factoring in this new equity raise, but without factoring in the conversion of the $1 billion of convertible notes. Frankly, I doubt that those notes will ever get converted, given the share price appreciation that would be needed to make that possible. Author - SEC EDGAR Data In the event that Trump Media & Technology Group was achieving attractive growth, and showed evidence that it could generate significant revenue, profits, and cash flows, per user, then perhaps there could be some potential for the company. But in the chart below, you can see that the firm continues to lose significant amounts of cash and, in the most recent quarter alone, it generated revenue of only $821,200. That's enough revenue to buy two of the average homes in the US. It's nowhere near enough to justify an implied market capitalization, following this offering, of $6.43 billion. Author - SEC EDGAR Data Takeaway Based on all the data currently available, it seems to me as though the market reacted appropriately in response to this latest announcement by the management team at Trump Media & Technology Group. Unless you expect Bitcoin prices to skyrocket, I really don't see a way in which this benefits shareholders. The company remains drastically overpriced, and I believe that management's plans on how to classify the Bitcoin it intends to purchase are at odds with GAAP and U.S. law. This only furthers my view that the company deserves a ‘strong sell’ rating.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4790458-bitcoin-represents-false-hope-regulatory-concerns-for-trump-media-technology-group?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","BTC-USD|DJT",cryptocompare

Bitcoin Chart Analysis: A Triangle Break Looms Technically, the Bitcoin price prediction remains neutral in the short term. On the chart, BTC is consolidating around $108,966 in a symmetrical triangle on the 2-hour chart – a breakout is brewing. The price is holding above the 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $108,996, which serves as dynamic support. A bounce from this level, especially with a doji or spinning top candle, may be a bullish break. Fibonacci levels from $102,190 to $111,930 show a confluence zone at $108,209. A move above $109,631 (0.236 Fibonacci) could trigger a move to $111,935 and $113,300. BTC/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The MACD is neutral but poised for a bullish crossover, while the RSI is approaching overbought territory – be cautious of a potential fake breakout. If BTC breaks below the triangle’s lower trendline and support at $108,233 or $107,078, it could lead to a rapid decline to $105,905 or $102,190. The market is poised for a significant shift. Watch these levels closely. BTC Bull Token Presale Approaches $7.50M Mark as 65% APY Staking Draws Interest With BTC/USD dipping below $108,000, attention is shifting to altcoins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . So far, $6.38 million has been raised, with the next price jump approaching quickly. Bitcoin Rewards and Supply Reductions BTC Bull Token operates with a built-in system: the higher BTC’s price, the more BTC airdrops are distributed to token holders. Notably, presale participants receive priority. The system also features: Token burns every $50K BTC increase, reducing supply. Current token price at $0.002535 before the next bump. This approach aligns token value with BTC/USD’s price moves while maintaining scarcity through programmed burns. Staking Terms for Passive Returns – BTCBULL’s staking pool holds 1.62 billion tokens offering 65% APY, with: No lockup periods or fees. Full access to funds at any time. This structure appeals to investors seeking yield without complex requirements or the risk of illiquidity. Momentum Before the Cap Fills With nearly $1 million remaining in the presale, buyers are positioning early. The token’s mechanics, including BTC-tied rewards, supply adjustments, and staking options, are driving participation. Key figures: USDT raised : $6,520,678/ $7,505,377 Token price : $0.00253 BTCBULL offers a whopping ~65% APY on its Ethereum-based staking pool (currently holding 1.61B BTCBULL), with no lockups or withdrawal fees.

The flagship cryptocurrency has struggled to reclaim $110,000 after briefly crossing it on Wednesday. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and fell to a low of $109,065 before rebounding to its current level. BTC is marginally down over the past 24 hours, trading around $108,819. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) continued to trade in positive territory, with the price up nearly 2%, trading around $2,631. Ripple (XRP) is marginally down, trading around $2.29, while Solana (SOL) is around $174. Dogecoin (DOGE) , Cardano (ADA) , Stellar (XLM) , Chainlink (LINK) , Hedera (HBAR) , Toncoin (TON) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable declines. However, Litecoin (LTC) bucked the bearish trend and registered a marginal increase. US Markets Rally As Trump Delays EU Tariffs The US stock market soared after President Donald Trump agreed to delay a 50% tariff on imports from the European Union. The delay eased investor concerns of a renewed trade war and suggested a potential for accelerated negotiations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose almost 740 points while the S&P 500 rose over 2%. The Nasdaq Composite rose nearly 3%, with Nvidia, Tesla, and Apple shares posting substantial gains. Following President Trump’s decision, the European Union agreed to expedite trade discussions in the hope of “averting the mutual pain of tariffs.” Investor sentiment was further boosted by returning consumer confidence, which increased after declining for five months. Tuesday’s market recovery saw over 90% of S&P 500 companies close higher. Bond markets were optimistic, with US Treasuries rallying and yields falling. The 10-year yield fell to 4.43%, while the 30-year yield dropped to 4.94%. The US Dollar also strengthened, with global bond markets responding positively to the news that Japan will scale back long-term bond issuance after recent volatility. France Arrests 12 Linked To Crypto Kidnappings French authorities have arrested 12 people linked to two high-profile crypto kidnapping cases in Paris. Those detained include several minors, with authorities charging the individuals with kidnapping, attempted kidnapping, and criminal conspiracy. Authorities are also investigating the possibility that a criminal organization is behind two recent crypto kidnapping cases, with recruitment being done via social media. One recent kidnapping attempt saw three men attempt to snatch the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizai, the co-founder and CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium. The attempt was captured on video and was thwarted as Noizat’s daughter fought back and passersby intervened. In another incident, French authorities rescued the father of a crypto entrepreneur who was captured and being held for a ransom of 7 million euros. Trump Media Group Confirms $2.5B Capital Raise Trump Media and Technology Group, the entity behind the Truth Social platform, has confirmed plans for a $2.5 billion capital raise to purchase Bitcoin (BTC) . The group had initially denied earlier reports about the planned raise. According to a May 27 announcement, the capital raise comprises a $1.5 billion stock sale and $1 billion in convertible senior secured bonds with a 0% coupon. The sale is expected to close on May 29. Trump Media and Technology Group CEO Devin Nunes stated, “We view Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets. This investment will help defend our company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions.” Thailand To Allow Tourists To Spend Crypto Thailand is planning to allow tourists to spend crypto via credit card-linked platforms as part of a broader strategy to modernize its financial system and embrace digital assets. Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira announced the initiative during an investor seminar held in Bangkok on May 26. The initiative is currently being reviewed by the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Thailand. Merchants will receive Thai baht as usual, often without knowing crypto was used to complete the transaction. The pilot will roll out after key regulatory checks and infrastructure are in place. “This approach can be immediately adapted for Thailand, provided the supporting systems are in place.” Thailand is also planning to reform its financial laws. According to Pichai, the government needs to unify the legal treatment of the traditional capital market and the digital asset space, which are currently governed by separate acts. Pichai also stated that the government is reviewing outdated restrictions on institutional investors as part of broader capital market reforms. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin's (BTC) price action remained subdued on Tuesday, registering a marginal decline after the flagship cryptocurrency failed to reclaim $110,000. Analysts have indicated that BTC faces the risk of a pullback to $100,000 as sellers gain the upper hand at upper levels. However, they believe overall sentiment around the asset remains bullish. BTC saw limited volatility on Tuesday as buyers pushed the price to an intraday high of $110,725. However, it failed to stay at this level and ultimately settled at $108,951. The current session sees the price marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. If buyers gain the upper hand, BTC could push towards $115,000. However, it must first overcome the resistance at $112,000, a level it has struggled to cross in recent sessions. A break above this level could see the price jump to $115,000. If BTC can overcome this level, a move to $120,000 can be expected. On the other hand, a decline from current levels could see the price test the $100,000 support level. Despite BTC’s burgeoning rally to a new all-time high last week, analysts are uncertain whether the bullish sentiment will continue into Q3. Historically, Q3 has been BTC’s weakest on average. Bitfinex analysts discussed BTC’s performance in Q3 in a market note, stating, “The coming weeks will likely determine whether Bitcoinʼs latest breakout was a local high or the prelude to a more aggressive leg higher in Q3.” Analysts also expect a period of consolidation or mild retracement, adding that such price action would be healthy for BTC. “A period of consolidation or mild retracement would not only be healthy but also provide a more sustainable foundation for the next leg higher.” The third quarter has historically been BTC’s worst-performing quarter since 2013, with an average return of just 6.03% in the past 11 years, according to data from Coinglass. According to analysts BTC has entered a short-term range-bound phase, with short-term holders selling their positions in the past 30 days. “With over $11.4 billion in short-term holder profits realized in the past month, the near-term supply overhang is expected — but so is structural demand.” BTC was bearish the previous weekend, registering marginal declines on Friday (May 16) and Saturday to settle at $103,235. The price recovered on Sunday, rising over 3% to cross $106,000 and settle at $106,489. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $102,135 on Monday before rebounding to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,572, ultimately registering a decline of almost 1%. BTC recovered on Tuesday, rising 1.21% and settling at $106,854. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as BTC rose 2.57% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,603. Source: TradingView The flagship cryptocurrency raced to a new all-time high on Thursday, rising to $111,970 before registering a marginal decline and settling at $111,582. However, market sentiment turned bearish on Friday, and BTC plunged nearly 4% and settled at $107,356. BTC recovered over the weekend, rising 0.46% on Saturday and 1.15% on Sunday to reclaim $109,000 and settle at $109,095. BTC started the current week in positive territory, registering a marginal increase and moving to $109,453. However, it was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping 0.46% to $108,951. The current session sees BTC marginally up as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. The RSI is close to the overbought zone, while the MACD is bearish, indicating sellers have the upper hand. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) is consolidating at a key level, with its bullish structure intact. If the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency can break out from this level, analysts predict it could surge to $4,000. ETH is forming a bullish continuation pattern just below the $2,700 resistance level, with markets showing strength following a dip to $2,326 at the beginning of the previous week. ETH’s consolidation below $2,700 is significant because there is limited historical resistance above it, paving the way for a swift move past $3,000 to $4,000. ETH’s current ascending pattern is formed by rising lows pushing into a flat resistance, typically associated with a bullish continuation. ETH was bearish the previous weekend, registering a marginal decline on Friday before dropping 2.44% to $2,475. The price faced volatility on Sunday before ultimately registering an increase of nearly 1% and settling at $2,498. ETH plunged to an intraday low of $2,349 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register an increase of 1.18%, reclaim $2,500 and settle at $2,527. ETH registered a marginal decline on Tuesday before rebounding on Wednesday and settling at $2,552. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment intensified Thursday as ETH rose more than 4% to cross $2,600 and settle at $2,664. The price reached an intraday high of $2,731 on Friday but lost momentum after reaching this level and falling over 5% to $2,525. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, ETH rebounded over the weekend, registering a marginal increase on Saturday and then rising nearly 1% on Sunday to settle at $2,551. ETH started the current week positively, registering a marginal increase and settling at $2,564. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as the price rose nearly 4% to reclaim $2,600 and settle at $2,662. The current session sees ETH down over 1% as sellers look to drive the price below $2,600. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana’s (SOL) struggles have continued during the ongoing session, with the price down nearly 2% during the ongoing session. The Solana blockchain has also come under criticism from Standard Chartered, which said the Layer1 blockchain could become a “one-trick pony” for memecoin trading. Standard Chartered stated in its report that Solana dominates in areas that demand high-volume, low transaction-cost solutions due to its design, which prioritizes quick and cheap transaction confirmations. Standard Chartered suggested this could have unintended consequences, stating, “So far, this has been mostly in memecoin trading, which accounts for the majority of activity on Solana (as measured by ‘GDP’, which is application revenue).” According to the report, the memecoin trading frenzy acted as a stress test for Solana’s scalability but also had drawbacks due to the volatility and speculative nature of memecoins.

2025-05-28T13:21:48.000Z,"David Sacks Suggests U.S. Could Buy More Bitcoin—If It Doesn’t Hurt the Budget","David Sacks, the White House’s top advisor on AI and cryptocurrency policy, revealed that the U.S. government could consider purchasing more Bitcoin—provided it can be done without increasing taxes or adding to the national debt. Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference on May 27 during a fireside chat with Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Sacks outlined a possible route for such an acquisition, though he admitted it wouldn’t be easy. “I can’t promise anything,” Sacks said. “But there is a pathway for the government to buy more Bitcoin if we can do it in a budget-neutral way.” That would mean identifying funding within existing programs that aren’t utilizing their allocations and redirecting those funds without imposing new taxes or worsening the fiscal deficit. He noted that gaining support from Treasury Secretary Scott Besson or Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick would be key. “If they can get excited about the idea and figure out how to fund it without adding to the debt, then we could potentially acquire more Bitcoin,” Sacks said. Bitcoin Reserve Program Has Presidential Backing According to Sacks, the potential for the government to increase its BTC holdings stems from a March 6 executive order which established the framework for a U.S. crypto reserve . The order permits the government to retain Bitcoin seized in criminal or civil proceedings and opens the door to new purchases—under strict budgetary conditions. “Specifically, the executive order allows for the acquisition of BTC as long as it’s done in a budget-neutral fashion,” Sacks emphasized. This means any new Bitcoin acquisition must be internally financed, not through public debt or taxation. Holdings Under Review As of April, the U.S. government holds around 198,012 Bitcoin, worth over $21 billion at current market prices. Much of this stash was acquired through high-profile seizures: 69,370 BTC from the Silk Road bust in 2020, 51,351 BTC in a separate 2022 seizure, and 94,636 BTC from the Bitfinex hack linked to Ilya Lichtenstein . In January, the Department of Justice received approval to sell 198,109 Bitcoin. This follows a March 2023 sale of 9,861 BTC for $215.7 million. Whether the government decides to sell, hold, or buy more will now depend on the evolving fiscal strategy.

2025-05-28T13:20:40.000Z,"James Wynn’s high-stakes crypto gamble nears breaking point","James Wynn has now fully lost the gains he recently made in a series of high-risk trades. With his current bet nearing the liquidation threshold, Wynn now stands on the brink of losing the principal tied to that position as well. According to reporting by EmberCN , Wynn made $11.67 million by going long on Trump ( TRUMP ) and Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ) between May 12–13. However, on May 23, he lost $5.29 million through long positions in Ethereum ( ETH ) and Sui ( SUI ). A brief rebound followed on May 24, when longs on Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Pepe ( PEPE ) netted him a $42.08 million profit. But the gains were again eroded between May 25–27, as shorting BTC and longing PEPE led to a $16.72 million loss. At press time, Wynn’s open BTC long position has already incurred an unrealized PnL of $718,098. He is currently long 1,840 BTC with 40x leverage—valued at $200,347,340. The position was opened at $109,228, and his liquidation price stands at $102,257, putting his principal at risk if the market moves further against him. The current BTC price is $108,874, only 6% away from liquidation.

2025-05-28T14:15:00.000Z,"Elderly crypto investors are getting scammed: Teach them these key safety tips","Why are seniors being targeted in crypto scams?              Scammers prey on seniors because they view them as financially secure, trusting and less familiar with rapidly evolving technology.Let’s understand why seniors are key targets.Perception of wealth: Many older adults have retirement savings or pensions, making them lucrative targets.Lower tech fluency: Navigating crypto wallets, private keys and blockchain concepts can be intimidating, something scammers exploit.Embarrassment prevents reporting: Victims often feel ashamed, making them less likely to report the crime.Crypto is irreversible: Once funds are sent via Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, there’s no reversing the transaction. That’s a dream scenario for scammers.According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), seniors report growing losses linked to cryptocurrency investment fraud, romance scams and government impersonation. In South Carolina’s Beaufort County alone, seniors reported over $3.1 million in crypto scam losses in 2024.And these scams are becoming more sophisticated. AI tools can now clone voices, spoof caller IDs and create fake websites that mimic legitimate exchanges or financial institutions to steal from unsuspecting seniors.                  Examples of crypto scams targeting older adults              From crypto romance fraud in Cambodia targeting British pensioners to ATM scams in Minnesota and impersonation schemes across the US, scammers have stolen millions by preying on older adults’ trust and unfamiliarity with digital assets.1. Cambodian scam compounds exploiting British pensionersIn Bavet, Cambodia, scam compounds operated by networks linked to the Chinese mafia have been uncovered. These operations enslave trafficked workers, forcing them to participate in romance and cryptocurrency fraud. British pensioners have been prime targets, suffering significant losses.. One victim from the West Midlands lost over 250,000 British pounds ($340,000). These scams often employ “pig-butchering” tactics, cultivating trust online before executing large-scale financial fraud.2. Crypto ATM scams in MinnesotaIn Minnesota, over 5,500 incidents involving cryptocurrency kiosks led to losses exceeding $189 million in 2023. Seniors were the most vulnerable victims, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the stolen funds. Scammers often direct victims to transfer funds using QR codes tied to fraudulent accounts. Cities like Stillwater have implemented bans on crypto ATMs to protect residents.3. Romance scam targeting a disabled woman in the UKLisa Nock, a 44-year-old woman from Staffordshire with autism and mobility issues, fell victim to a romance scam after being targeted on Instagram by someone impersonating Australian TV vet Dr. Chris Brown. Over 18 months, the scammer manipulated her into transferring £11,000 in cryptocurrency, claiming the funds were for flights, visas and hiring a substitute vet. Lisa eventually realized the deceit and reported the fraud to authorities.4. Government or bank impersonators demanding crypto paymentsScammers may impersonate the IRS, Social Security Administration, Medicare or local law enforcement. Their script is simple: You’re in legal trouble or owe back taxes, and the only way to avoid arrest or penalties is to pay in Bitcoin.This tactic has been used across the US. In South Carolina, a retired healthcare worker named Marianne was told she missed jury duty and owed $7,500. Following fake sheriff’s instructions, she fed the cash into a Coinstar crypto ATM, which instantly converted her money to Bitcoin and sent it straight to scammers.5. Ohio woman loses life savings in cryptocurrency investment scam An Ohio woman lost her life savings in a cryptocurrency investment scam that defrauded victims of about $4.9 million. The scheme involved 33 identified victims nationwide, with five more accounts under FBI investigation.Did you know? A $243 million Bitcoin heist involving a fake Google call spiraled into a real-world kidnapping plot straight out of a Netflix thriller.                  7 Key safety tips every elderly crypto investor should know              Elderly investors should follow key safety steps like never sending crypto to strangers, verifying suspicious contacts, enabling two-factor authentication, avoiding public WiFi and discussing large transactions with trusted family before acting.Here are the key safety tips every elderly crypto investor should be aware of:Never send crypto to strangers: If someone you’ve never met in person asks for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies,  it’s almost certainly a scam. This includes social media, messages on Facebook, emails from supposed tech support or even someone you’ve been chatting with on a dating site. No legitimate person or organization will randomly ask for crypto. If you’re being told, “Send me $500 and I’ll send back $1,000,” you’re being conned. Always assume unsolicited crypto requests are fraudulent.Double-check all contacts: If you get a call, email, or text from a bank, the IRS or even a family member in crisis, don’t respond immediately. Call the official number on your bank card or government website to verify.Use trusted wallets and exchanges only: Stick to platforms with strong security and regulation like Coinbase, Kraken and Binance.US. Avoid apps from unknown websites or links in emails.Watch for pressure tactics: Scammers thrive on urgency; you only have two hours to pay; act now to claim your prize. Real financial institutions do not use this kind of pressure.Set up two-factor authentication (2FA): All crypto wallets and exchange accounts should have 2FA enabled. This adds a second layer of protection even if a password is stolen.Avoid public WiFi for crypto transactions: Never send crypto or log in to financial apps over public WiFi at coffee shops, airports or hotels. These networks are often unsecured and can be intercepted by hackers. Use your home WiFi or mobile data instead, and ensure your device has up-to-date antivirus protection.Talk to family before big transactions: Before sending large amounts of crypto or any money, have a quick conversation with someone you trust. Scammers often isolate victims and make them feel they must act alone. Encourage seniors to adopt a simple rule: If it’s more than $100, talk to someone first. A five-minute phone call could prevent a five-figure mistake.                  Think grandma got scammed? Here’s what to do immediately              If you’ve been scammed, act fast: Report it to the crypto exchange (they might freeze the funds), file a fraud report with the FTC or Chainabuse and contact elder support services for guidance and protection.1. Report the scam to the exchangeIf the funds were sent through Coinbase, Binance or another exchange, contact them right away. Some may be able to freeze accounts if action is taken quickly.2. File a report with law enforcement and the FTCCall your local police department.Report fraud to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.You can also report crypto fraud at Chainabuse.com, a trusted crypto crime reporting platform.3. Contact elder support resourcesElderCare Locator (USA): Connects older adults and families to local services, including Adult Protective Services for financial exploitation cases.Action Fraud (UK): The UK’s national fraud reporting center for scams, including those involving crypto.Scamwatch, ACCC (Australia): Provides scam alerts and allows reporting of cryptocurrency and financial scams affecting seniors.Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (Canada): A national agency for reporting and tracking fraud, including crypto scams targeting older adults.National Council on Aging – NCOA (US): Offers educational resources and scam prevention tools for seniors and caregivers.Age UK (UK): Provides advice and support for older people facing financial abuse, including online and crypto scams.Did you know? Hackers have been caught selling counterfeit smartphones infected with the Triada Trojan, malware that steals crypto and sensitive data by deeply embedding itself in the device’s system.                  Is crypto safe for seniors?              Yes, but only with proper education and safeguards. Cryptocurrency can be empowering, offering independence and investment opportunities. However, seniors can become easy targets without a strong awareness of the risks.Scammers increasingly target seniors through sophisticated tactics like fake investment platforms, romance scams and impersonation of government or tech support personnel. These schemes often involve urgent demands, emotional manipulation or unfamiliar technologies like crypto ATMs.To minimize risk, seniors should be educated on the basics of cryptocurrency, recognize common fraud tactics, use reputable platforms and involve trusted family or advisers before making transactions. Awareness and vigilance are essential to protect both assets and peace of mind in the digital age.As crypto continues to go mainstream, scammers are adapting fast. Don’t let your loved ones get rug-pulled or emotionally manipulated into losing everything. Share these tips. Stay involved. And when in doubt, always verify before sending funds.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/elderly-crypto-investors-are-getting-scammed-teach-them-these-key-safety-tips?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Later in the month, Texas lawmakers advanced a bill to establish a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, backed by Governor Greg Abbott.Speaking with Cointelegraph Magazine, Back gave a 2025 price target of “a few hundred thousand” dollars, citing renewed retail demand once roughly $16 billion in FTX bankruptcy repayments re-enter the market. He added that he is confident many of those investors will cycle back into the crypto market to fuel the next big rally.2. Smart money agrees on Bitcoin’s year-end targetSeveral analysts have set $200,000 as their target for Bitcoin in 2025. Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets at Standard Chartered, has been one of the leading voices.Kendrick said in an email note seen by Cointelegraph that Bitcoin is expected to hit $120,000 in the first half of 2025 en route to $200,000 by year-end, fueled by the rise of stablecoins.Related: A Bitcoiner’s guide to South Africa’s Garden Route“The US Senate… voted 66-32 to advance the GENIUS Act,” Kendrick wrote in the email note. “The point of the stablecoin Act is that stablecoins will further legitimise the whole asset class.

David Geale, executive director of payments and digital finance at the FCA, said the agency aims to support innovation while ensuring market trust:“At the FCA, we have long supported innovation that benefits consumers and markets. At present, crypto is largely unregulated in the UK.

It marks the first monthly sales increase since the start of the year, suggesting renewed interest in digital collectibles. This follows a five-month decline in sales since volume peaked at over $900 million in December 2024. May also had the highest number of transactions in 2025, reaching 5.5 million, according to CryptoSlam. The sales uptick could also be attributed to the divergence between unique NFT buyers and unique NFT sellers. NFT buyers continued to increase in May, while sellers declined. Chart compiled by Cointelegraph to demonstrate CryptoSlam data on NFT monthly sales.

Source: NebraskanGooner/TradingViewGooner EMA is a technical indicator created by trader NebraskanGooner that uses the 11- and 22-period exponential moving averages (EMA). When the price crosses above the EMA range, it often leads to further gains. When the price closes below the EMA range, it tends to follow deeper losses. SUI lost this support, roughly between $3.34 and $3.59, last week after a $200 million exploit hit Cetus, a decentralized exchange built on the Sui blockchain.Related: Sui validators vote on $162M Cetus recovery plan to restore user fundsNow that SUI has reclaimed the zone, bullish sentiment is returning, according to NebraskanGooner.He wrote:“As long as it can hold Gooner EMA support, it can retest ATHs.

These include AnchorZero, a platform helping crypto founders use Roth IRAs for tax advantages, and Spark Capital, a new venture focused on stablecoin infrastructure.Other portfolio companies include Ethena, ClearToken, Crossover Markets, Station70 and Theo — an onchain trading infrastructure project that recently raised $20 million from 17 different VC firms.The company plans to eventually back up to 30 companies with early-stage rounds ranging from $500,000 to $1 million.Metalayer was co-founded by Chainlink Labs’ former head of growth, Mickey Graham, and former Two Sigma executives Andy Kangpan and David Winton.Winton developed a proprietary data platform called Moirai to help Metalayer analyze developer activity, protocol engagement and blockchain transaction patterns to uncover promising projects. “Moirai is our internal sourcing engine for identifying early-stage crypto startups,” Graham told Cointelegraph in a written statement. “The platform is designed to help us systematically surface high-quality startups, and it evaluates opportunities across several key dimensions,” he said.Related: VC Roundup: 8-figure funding deals suggest crypto bull market far from overCrypto VC deals on the rise, but there’s a catchCrypto venture capital activity saw a notable uptick in the first quarter, with increases in both total funding and deal volume, according to data from Galaxy Digital. VC funding reached $4.9 billion during the quarter, though nearly half came from a single deal — Binance, which raised $2 billion from MGX, an investment firm backed by a United Arab Emirates sovereign wealth fund.Despite the outsized impact of the Binance deal, overall market activity showed signs of improving. A total of 446 crypto funding deals were recorded in Q1, marking a 7% increase from the previous quarter.Crypto VC deals remain considerably lower than the peak of the previous bull market. Source: GalaxyNevertheless, venture capital investors remain cautious about making fresh commitments to the sector, according to Robert Lee, a senior analyst at PitchBook. The first quarter was a challenging market environment as a sharp correction in crypto prices compounded investor reluctance.In an interview with Bloomberg last month, Lee noted that many venture capital firms are still on the sidelines. “[M]any of the funds from the last cycle have yet to deliver meaningful DPI,” he said, referring to the private equity metric Distributed to Paid-In Capital, which measures how much capital has been returned to investors relative to what they invested.Metalayer’s Mickey Graham believes that at least some of this drop-off is due to a much-needed transition happening beneath the surface:“We believe the crypto industry has crossed the chasm from an early market defined by infrastructure-building to a mainstream technology sector characterized by the deployment of blockchain technology throughout the global economy.”Although VC activity remains subdued compared to past bull cycles, Kadan Stadelmann, the chief technology officer of the Komodo Platform, told Cointelegraph that the industry has seen an “uptick in mergers and acquisitions, suggesting market maturation.”Stadelmann indicated that pro-crypto regulations in the United States and European Union, “have given large institutions confidence to continue making investments into crypto firms.”At a geographic level, the US accounted for more than a third of total crypto VC deals in 2024 — a trend expected to continue this year.

Could this technical setup, coupled with the SEC’s review of a spot XRP ETF application by WisdomTree, signal the start of a rally to $3.40 and higher?XRP falling wedge pattern targets $3.40From a technical perspective, XRP (XRP) price could gain significant momentum if it breaks out of this falling wedge pattern.In technical analysis, a falling wedge is a bullish reversal chart pattern that comprises two converging trend lines that connect lower highs and lower lows. This convergence indicates a weakening downward momentum. XRP price is currently retesting the resistance provided by the upper trendline of the wedge at $2.42. A break above this level will likely trigger a quick rise in price, with the bulls targeting the technical target of the wedge at $3.40, a 48% increase from current prices.XRP/USD daily chart.

In his widely cited 2022 paper, “The Ineluctable Modality of Securities Law: Why Fungible Crypto Assets Are Not Securities,” he wrote:“[T]here is no current basis in the law relating to ‘investment contracts’ to classify most fungible crypto assets as ‘securities’ when transferred in secondary transactions.”In his paper, Cohen explained that in secondary transactions, an investment contract transaction is generally not present. He further claimed that fungible cryptocurrencies “neither create nor represent the necessary cognizable legal relationship between” a legal entity and the holder that is the “hallmark of a security.”Related: Banking groups ask SEC to drop cybersecurity incident disclosure ruleSEC’s “new paradigm”Ripple also referenced SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce's May 19 “new paradigm” speech.

My supplemental answer is that economic realities matter and non-security crypto assets may be distributed as part of an investment contract, which is a type of security.”Ripple’s long fight with the SECThe SEC had viewed a large portion of digital assets as securities, with the regulator’s former chair, Gary Gensler, stating in 2023 that most of the crypto market falls under the securities bracket. This stance led to a protracted legal battle between the SEC and Ripple.The lawsuit first began at the end of 2020, when the SEC took action against Ripple and its executives, claiming that XRP sales constituted unregistered security offerings. Still, after the government’s stance on crypto changed with the election of current US President Donald Trump, Ripple has mostly won the battle, with the SEC recently dropping its appeal against a ruling favorable to the company.In its recent letter to the SEC, Ripple also cited a ruling in the case noting that “the court held that certain of Ripple’s historical institutional sales of XRP were investment contracts,” while the secondary sales were not.

Investors will not receive regular payments, with any potential profit expected to come from the bond’s redemption value.Evo Fund, a Cayman Islands-based investment firm, will be the sole bondholder. The investment company has been Metaplanet’s primary backer for its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, subscribing to multiple rounds of Metaplanet’s zero-interest bonds, providing capital for its Bitcoin (BTC) buys.The bonds are unsecured and unguaranteed, having neither a bond administrator nor collateral. This reflects a high degree of trust between the two companies. It also shows confidence in BTC’s long-term outlook as Metaplanet continues to increase its holdings. Excerpt of Metaplanet’s announcement to issue zero-interest bonds to buy Bitcoin.

However, the company noted it would disclose further developments if needed.  Metaplanet’s push into Bitcoin highlights a growing trend among companies seeking alternatives to fiat-based treasury strategies. The move follows Metaplanet’s second-biggest BTC purchase, scooping up 1,004 Bitcoin worth over $100 million. This pushed the company’s Bitcoin holdings to 7,800 BTC, worth over $800 million. According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET, Metaplanet is up by nearly 20% on its Bitcoin investments. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin strategy has also given its stock prices a boost. On May 27, 10x Research reported that Metaplanet’s stock trades as if Bitcoin were worth five times its actual price. The research company said investors in the company are “dramatically overpaying for their Bitcoin exposure.”Related: Bitcoin treasury pivot lifts luxury watchmaker’s stock more than 60%Bitcoin Treasury strategy attracts criticismWith the rise of Bitcoin treasury companies’ stock prices, getting Bitcoin exposure through corporate wrappers has attracted criticism from well-known investor Jim Chanos. At the Sohn Investment Conference in New York, Chanos said he’s selling MicroStrategy stock to buy Bitcoin. Chanos’ move assumes investors are overpaying for BTC exposure through MicroStrategy and other firms that follow the same blueprint. The investor’s move assumes that purchasing Bitcoin directly would be better than purchasing stocks for indirect Bitcoin exposure. Magazine: Can Off the Grid survive Steam’s crypto ban?

Five commissioners are supposed to make up the CFTC, and no more than three can be from the same political party.Goldsmith Romero said that during her tenure, all the commissioners had different perspectives and experiences that, when brought together, were “really helpful.”“So what happens if the CFTC gets down to one and gets new authority for crypto? It’s going to be really, really hard; you’re not going to have the same push and pull,” she said.The Trump administration has floated the idea of handing the reins of crypto regulation to the CFTC in the past. Congressional Republicans have also been drafting bills to give the CFTC greater oversight over the industry, Retail customer Definition should be CFTC priority In the future, Goldsmith Romero thinks the CFTC should work on defining a retail customer to ensure the influx of fresh investments in “crypto and some other products” has a similar retail customer protection regime to the Securities and Exchange Commission.Related: Crypto perp futures coming ‘very soon,’ says CFTC’s Mersinger“I came from the SEC with an investor protection regime, you want people to know their rights and risk if they take a risk and they lose that’s on them,” she said.“But you want to have some basic things like exchanges that are registered that have some basic requirements and have to follow the law and this is, I think, the main thing that needs to happen.”Goldsmith Romero said other “extremely basic” rules could include a ban against co-mingling a company’s assets with customer funds, and brokers, exchanges and clearing houses being required to register with the SEC, the CFTC or in some cases, both.Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/goldsmith-romero-cf-exodus-not-a-great-situation?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-28T02:11:48.000Z,"Real-world assets could revitalize dying NFT lending market: DappRadar","Real-world assets linking up with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is one of a few key catalysts that could reignite the waning NFT lending sector, which is suffering from a collapse in volumes and user activity, says blockchain analytics platform DappRadar.Volumes in the NFT lending market, which allows NFT holders to take out a loan against their token, have dropped 97% from a peak of around $1 billion in January 2024 to $50 million in May, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a May 27 report.Gherghelas said for NFT lending to “move beyond survival mode,” it needs “new catalysts” to reignite the sector, such as real-world asset NFTs, like tokenized real estate or yield-bearing assets that could unlock more stable, trusted collateral sources.“So far, 2025 has not delivered a compelling reason for NFT lending to bounce back,” she said. “While the infrastructure is still here and the platforms remain active, activity has slowed across the board.” Borrower and leading activity have taken a big hit in the NFT lending sector. Source: DappRadar“For now, the sector seems to be in a holding pattern, waiting either for market recovery or a new use case to reignite interest.”Gherghelas added that other catalysts that could rekindle NFT lending were tools that make it easier for NFT holders to borrow against their tokens, and that protocols should create “smart infrastructure” such as undercollateralized loans, credit scores and artificial intelligence risk matching.The report adds that since January last year, borrower activity has declined by 90% and those willing to lend have shrunk by 78%.The average NFT loan size has also taken a hit from a peak of $22,000 in 2022 to $4,000 in May, a 71% year-over-year drop.Gherghelas said this shift “shows that either users are borrowing against lower-value assets or simply becoming more conservative with leverage.”NFT lending overall trading volume and market activity have dropped off from the all-time highs of past years. Source: DappRadarThe average loan duration is also lower; after hitting an average of roughly 40 days in 2023, it’s been down to 31 days and has held steady throughout 2024 and into 2025.Gherghelas said this could indicate that “loans are being taken more frequently but for shorter periods, perhaps a sign of more tactical liquidity plays.”NFT ﻿market downturn also hurts lendingPart of the slowdown in NFT lending is connected to the overall NFT market decline, which has seen volumes drop 61% in the first quarter to $1.5 billion compared to $4.1 billion a year ago.“With collateral value collapsing, the lending activity naturally followed,” Gherghelas said. “There are a few exceptions that managed to hold or regain traction, but they’ve been outliers, not enough to lift the sector.”Related: AI decentralized apps are coming for the Web3 throne: DappRadarThe protocol landscape has also narrowed, and the number of active NFT lending apps is limited, with only eight protocols holding any meaningful share.“The flip-for-liquidity model that worked during bull markets isn’t built for a quieter, more risk-averse environment. But that doesn’t mean NFT lending is finished; it’s simply shifting focus,” Gherghelas said.“Platforms are diversifying, use cases are shifting, and collateral preferences are changing. If the next wave builds on utility, culture, and better design, NFT lending might just find its second wind — one built to last.”Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-world-assets-revitalize-dying-nft-lending-dappradar?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

SharpLink will invest $425 million to acquire 120,000 ETH. Ethereum futures open interest hits an all-time high of $36.1 billion, with ETH price climbing 4.5% on the daily chart. Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming (SBET) announced a $425 million private investment in public equity (PIPE), acquiring approximately 69.1 million shares at $6.15 each to establish the first Nasdaq-listed Ethereum (ETH) treasury company.Spearheaded by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, this move mirrors Strategy’s (MSTR) successful Bitcoin treasury strategy, which has yielded over $8.2 billion in gains in 2025, by leveraging stock and bond sales to acquire BTC.Former Ethereum core developer and contributor Eric Conner highlighted the bullish implications of SharpLink’s move, noting its potential to create a “public ETH proxy for funds that can’t hold tokens directly.” Conner emphasized that the acquisition of 120,000 ETH—likely to be staked—could lead to “supply compression” by removing tokens from circulation. The Ether proponent also pointed to the “new narrative fuel” this provides, positioning ETH as a “digital reserve collateral” and potentially driving its adoption on mainstream balance sheets through an equity wrapper like $SBET.However, crypto analyst VICTOR cautioned against over-enthusiasm, outlining the risk of leveraging gains from an altcoin still down 19% in 2025. In Q1 2025, Cointelegraph reported a sharp decline in Ethereum network fees, dropping to $605,000 from $2.5 million in just two weeks in March, alongside a noticeable decrease in decentralized app (DApp) activity.

The majority of these rallies—eight out of ten—resulted in negative returns, while one rally triggered a short squeeze, driving prices higher, and another displayed neutral price action.From a technical perspective, Ether’s price action on the daily chart posted a descending triangle, a bullish breakout pattern, which creates equal highs and higher lows, converging toward an imminent rally. The pattern is bordered by two trendlines, the upper resistance, currently around $2,700 and the ascending support line. A bullish breakout above $2,677 targets the pattern’s measured move, calculated by adding the triangle’s height to the breakout point.

Speaking at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, Sigel said the most viable path forward may involve inserting Bitcoin mining incentives into the congressional budget reconciliation process.According to Sigel, the most effective path to growing a US strategic Bitcoin reserve would be through targeted amendments to congressional budget legislation. These could include tax credits for mining companies that use methane gas and other incentives aimed at encouraging miners to share a portion of their mined BTC with the federal government. He argued that such an approach would allow the reserve to grow organically over time. Sigel also highlighted the limitations of executive actions in achieving this goal:\""The problem with executive action is that it's going to prompt lawsuits.

At the time, the company said Anchorage Digital and Copper would serve as custodians and collateral managers in the venture.Credit markets are a fundamental part of the financial system, allowing capital to flow between borrowers and lenders and supporting economic activity across sectors.

Bitcoin’s bullish momentum aligns with the favorable US financial conditions, as noted by Ecoinometrics. The macroeconomic-focused Bitcoin newsletter highlighted that the National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) shows a rapid shift to ultra-loose territory after a tightening phase in February 2025. The NFCI, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, tracks stress in the financial system by aggregating measures like credit spreads, leverage, and funding conditions. When the index moves into looser territory, it reflects easier access to capital and reduced market stress—conditions that typically encourage risk-taking behavior among investors.

2025-05-27T15:40:00.000Z,"93% of all Bitcoin is already mined. Here’s what that means","How much Bitcoin is left to mine?              Bitcoin’s total supply is hardcoded at 21 million BTC, a fixed upper limit that cannot be altered without a consensus-breaking change to the protocol. This finite cap is enforced at the protocol level and is central to Bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset.As of May 2025, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoin (BTC) have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created, and those remaining coins will be mined very slowly.The reason for this uneven distribution is Bitcoin’s exponential issuance schedule, governed by an event called the halving. When Bitcoin launched in 2009, the block reward was 50 BTC. Every 210,000 blocks — or approximately every four years — that reward is cut in half. Because the early rewards were so large, over 87% of the total supply was mined by the end of 2020. Each subsequent halving sharply reduces the rate of new issuance, meaning it will take over a century to mine the remaining 6.7%.According to current estimates, 99% of all Bitcoin will have been mined by 2035, but the final fraction — the last satoshis — won’t be produced until around the year 2140 due to the nature of geometric reward reduction.This engineered scarcity, combined with an immutable supply cap, is what draws comparisons between Bitcoin and physical commodities like gold. But Bitcoin is even more predictable: Gold’s supply grows at around 1.7% annually, whereas Bitcoin’s issuance rate is transparently declining.Did you know? Bitcoin’s supply curve is not terminal in the traditional sense. It follows an asymptotic trajectory — a kind of economic Zeno’s paradox — where rewards diminish indefinitely but never truly reach zero. Mining will continue until around 2140, by which point over 99.999% of the total 21 million BTC will have been issued.                  Beyond the supply cap: How lost coins make Bitcoin scarcer than you think              While over 93% of Bitcoin’s total supply has been mined, that doesn’t mean it’s all available. A significant portion is permanently out of circulation, lost due to forgotten passwords, misplaced wallets, destroyed hard drives or early adopters who never touched their coins again.Estimates from firms like Chainalysis and Glassnode suggest that between 3.0 million and 3.8 million BTC — roughly 14%-18% of the total supply — is likely gone for good. That includes high-profile dormant addresses like the one believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, which alone holds over 1.1 million BTC.This means Bitcoin’s true circulating supply may be closer to 16 million-17 million, not 21 million. And because Bitcoin is non-recoverable by design, any lost coins stay lost — permanently reducing supply over time.Now compare that to gold. Around 85% of the world’s total gold supply has been mined — approximately 216,265 metric tons, according to the World Gold Council — but nearly all of it remains in circulation or held in vaults, jewelry, ETFs and central banks. Gold can be remelted and reused; Bitcoin cannot be resurrected once access is lost.This distinction gives Bitcoin a kind of hardening scarcity, a supply that not only stops growing over time but quietly shrinks.As Bitcoin matures, it’s entering a monetary phase similar to gold: low issuance, high holder concentration and increasing demand-side sensitivity. But Bitcoin takes it further; its supply cap is hard, its loss rate is permanent, and its distribution is publicly auditable.This may lead to several outcomes:Increased price volatility as available supply becomes more limited and sensitive to market demandHigher long-term value concentration in the hands of those who remain active and secure in their key managementA premium on liquidity, where actually spendable BTC trades at a higher effective value than dormant supply.In extreme cases, this could produce a bifurcation between “circulating BTC” and “unreachable BTC,” with the former gaining greater economic significance, particularly in times of constrained exchange liquidity or macroeconomic stress.                  What happens when Bitcoin is fully mined?              There’s a popular assumption that as Bitcoin’s block rewards shrink, the network’s security will eventually suffer. But in practice, the mining economy is far more adaptive — and much more resilient — than that.Bitcoin’s mining incentives are governed by a self-correcting feedback loop: If mining becomes unprofitable, miners drop off the network, which in turn triggers a difficulty adjustment. Every 2,016 blocks (roughly every two weeks), the network recalibrates mining difficulty using a parameter known as nBits. The goal is to keep block times steady at around 10 minutes, regardless of how many miners are competing.So, if Bitcoin’s price drops, or the reward becomes too small relative to operating costs, inefficient miners simply exit. This causes difficulty to fall, lowering the cost for those who remain. The result is a system that continually rebalances itself, aligning network participation with available incentives.This mechanism has already been tested at scale. After China banned mining in mid-2021, Bitcoin’s global hashrate dropped by more than 50% in a matter of weeks. Yet the network continued to function without interruption, and within a few months, the hashrate fully recovered, as miners resumed operations in jurisdictions with lower energy costs and more favorable regulations.Critically, the idea that lower rewards will inherently threaten network security overlooks how mining is tied to profit margins, not nominal BTC amounts. As long as the market price supports the cost of hash power — even at 0.78125 BTC per block (post-2028 halving) or lower — miners will continue to secure the network.In other words, it’s not the absolute reward that matters, but whether mining remains profitable relative to costs. And thanks to Bitcoin’s built-in difficulty adjustment, it usually does.Even a century from now, when the block reward approaches zero, the network will likely still be protected by whatever combination of fees, base incentives and infrastructure efficiency exists at that time. But that’s a distant concern. In the meantime, the current system — hashrate adjusts, difficulty rebalances, miners adapt — remains one of the most robust elements of Bitcoin’s design.Did you know? On April 20, 2024, following the launch of the Runes protocol, Bitcoin miners earned over $80 million in transaction fees within a single day, surpassing the $26 million earned from block rewards. This marked the first time in Bitcoin’s history that transaction fees alone exceeded the block subsidy in daily miner revenue.                  The future of Bitcoin mining: Energy consumption              It’s a common misconception that rising Bitcoin prices will drive endless energy use. In reality, mining is constrained by profitability, not price alone.As block rewards shrink, miners are pushed toward thinner margins, and that means chasing the cheapest, cleanest energy available. Since China’s 2021 mining ban, hashrate has migrated to regions like North America and Northern Europe, where operators tap into surplus hydro, wind and underutilized grid energy.According to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, between 52% and 59% of Bitcoin mining now runs on renewables or low-emission sources. Regulations are reinforcing this trend, with several jurisdictions offering incentives for clean-powered mining or penalizing fossil-fuel operations.Moreover, the idea that higher BTC prices will always mean higher energy use misses how Bitcoin self-regulates: More miners raise difficulty, which compresses margins, capping energy expansion. Renewable-based mining brings its own challenges, but the dystopian future of endlessly expanding fossil-fueled hash power is increasingly unlikely.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/93-of-all-bitcoin-is-already-mined-heres-what-that-means?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T15:00:00.000Z,"ZKPs can prove I&#039;m old enough without telling you my age","Opinion by: Andre Omietanski, General Counsel, and Amal Ibraymi, Legal Counsel at Aztec LabsWhat if you could prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthday, name, or anything else at all? Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) make this hypothetical a reality and solve one of the key challenges online: verifying age without sacrificing privacy. The need for better age verification todayWe're witnessing an uptick in laws being proposed restricting minors' access to social media and the internet, including in Australia, Florida, and China. To protect minors from inappropriate adult content, platform owners and governments often walk a tightrope between inaction and overreach. For example, the state of Louisiana in the US recently enacted a law meant to block minors from viewing porn. Sites required users to upload an ID before viewing content. The Free Speech Coalition challenged the law as unconstitutional, making the case that it infringed on First Amendment rights. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed on procedural grounds. The reaction, however, highlights the dilemma facing policymakers and platforms: how to block minors without violating adults' rights or creating new privacy risks.Traditional age verification failsCurrent age verification tools are either ineffective or invasive. Self-declaration is meaningless, since users can simply lie about their age. ID-based verification is overly invasive. No one should be required to upload their most sensitive documents, putting themselves at risk of data breaches and identity theft. Biometric solutions like fingerprints and face scans are convenient for users but raise important ethical, privacy, and security concerns. Biometric systems are not always accurate and may generate false positives and negatives. The irreversible nature of the data, which can't be changed like a regular password can, is also less than ideal. Other methods, like behavioral tracking and AI-driven verification of browser patterns, are also problematic, using machine learning to analyze user interactions and identify patterns and anomalies, raising concerns of a surveillance culture.ZKPs as the privacy-preserving solutionZero-knowledge proofs present a compelling solution. Like a government ID provider, a trusted entity verifies the user's age and generates a cryptographic proof confirming they are over the required age. Websites only need to check the proof, not the excess personal data, ensuring privacy while keeping minors at the gates. No centralized data storage is required, alleviating the burden on platforms such as Google, Meta, and WhatsApp and eliminating the risk of data breaches. Recent: How zero-knowledge proofs can make AI fairerAdopting and enforcing ZKPs at scaleZKPs aren't a silver bullet. They can be complex to implement. The notion of \""don't trust, verify,\"" proven by indisputable mathematics, may cause some regulatory skepticism. Policymakers may hesitate to trust cryptographic proofs over visible ID verification. There are occasions when companies may need to disclose personal information to authorities, such as during an investigation into financial crimes or government inquiries. This would challenge ZKPs, whose very intention is for platforms not to hold this data in the first place.ZKPs also struggle with scalability and performance, being somewhat computationally intensive and tricky to program. Efficient implementation techniques are being explored, and breakthroughs, such as the Noir programming language, are making ZKPs more accessible to developers, driving the adoption of secure, privacy-first solutions. A safer, smarter future for age verificationGoogle's move to adopt ZKPs for age verification is a promising signal that mainstream platforms are beginning to embrace privacy-preserving technologies. But to fully realize the potential of ZKPs, we need more than isolated solutions locked into proprietary ecosystems. Crypto-native wallets can go further. Open-source and permissionless blockchain-based systems offer interoperability, composability, and programmable identity. With a single proof, users can access a range of services across the open web — no need to start from scratch every time, or trust a single provider (Google) with their credentials.ZKPs flip the script on online identity — proving what matters, without exposing anything else. They protect user privacy, help platforms stay compliant, and block minors from restricted content, all without creating new honeypots of sensitive data.Google's adoption of ZKPs shows mainstream momentum is building. But to truly transform digital identity, we must embrace crypto-native, decentralized systems that give users control over what they share and who they are online.In an era defined by surveillance, ZKPs offer a better path forward — one that's secure, private, and built for the future.Opinion by: Andre Omietanski, General Counsel, and Amal Ibraymi, Legal Counsel at Aztec Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

This means every transaction is permanently recorded and accessible to anyone, making it possible for blockchain analysts or malicious actors to trace the flow of funds between wallets.A crypto mixer’s primary function is to break the link between the sender’s wallet and the recipient’s wallet. It does so by pooling together coins from many users and then redistributing them in a way that makes it difficult to track which coins went where. Think of it like a digital version of shuffling cards in a deck. After mixing, your cryptocurrency is returned to you or a recipient’s address, but it’s “cleaned” of any direct transaction history.This privacy-enhancing feature is why some people rely on mixers, especially those seeking to keep their financial activities confidential in an open-ledger world.                  How does a crypto mixer work?              To understand a crypto mixer, it’s useful to compare it to the concept of money laundering in traditional finance, albeit with legal and ethical nuances. The process of “mixing” is essentially designed to obscure the origin and destination of coins.Here’s a typical workflow of how a cryptocurrency mixer operates:Deposit: You send your cryptocurrency to the mixer’s wallet address. Multiple users do the same, creating a large pool of coins.Mixing/shuffling: The mixer’s system pools and shuffles these coins together, breaking any visible connection between deposited and withdrawn funds.Redistribution: After mixing, the service sends back an equivalent amount of coins to your specified address, but these aren’t the same coins you deposited. They come from the pooled coins of all participants.Fees: The mixer usually deducts a small fee, generally ranging from 1% to 3%, to cover operational costs.This process effectively disrupts blockchain analysis, making it extremely difficult for anyone to trace the coins back to their original owners.                  Types of cryptocurrency mixers              Not all mixers are created equal. They can broadly be divided into two categories: centralized and decentralized mixers.Centralized mixersCentralized mixers are the most common and operate similarly to traditional services. You send your coins to a company or entity that controls the mixing process, and then they send back “clean” coins after mixing. These services are relatively easy to use, often providing a simple user interface.However, centralized mixers require you to trust the service operator with your coins, at least temporarily. This introduces risks such as:The mixer could be a scam and disappear with your funds.It could be hacked, exposing users’ data and coins.The operator may keep logs that could compromise your privacy.Decentralized mixersDecentralized mixers use blockchain technology and smart contracts to automate the mixing process without a trusted third party. They rely on cryptographic methods such as zero-knowledge proofs to mix coins in a trustless environment. Users pool their coins into a smart contract, which then redistributes coins in a way that ensures privacy.Advantages of decentralized mixers include:No central point of failure or custody risk.Higher privacy because no single party controls the funds.Often more resistant to regulatory crackdowns.Did you know? The DOJ indicted four Russians for operating crypto mixers Blender.io and Sinbad.io, yet failed to show they knowingly laundered illicit funds. The indictment relies heavily on vague forum posts and lacks concrete evidence of criminal intent or ties to US commerce, raising serious doubts about its strength in court.                  Real-world cases involving mixers and scams              Unfortunately, the privacy offered by crypto mixers has also attracted criminals. The very anonymity that protects innocent users can also shield illicit activities, leading to widespread misuse.Crypto mixers have been linked to ransomware attacks, dark web marketplaces, fraud and drug trafficking. Criminals often use these services to “clean” proceeds from illegal transactions and hide their tracks from law enforcement.A notable example is ChipMixer, a service seized by Europol in 2023 for allegedly facilitating money laundering for dark web markets and ransomware groups. Authorities dismantled the platform’s infrastructure over alleged money laundering, seizing four servers, 1,909.4 BTC (about $210 million as of May 26, 2025) and seven TB of data across 55 transactions.Mixers have also been involved in laundering stolen funds from cryptocurrency exchange hacks. The complexity of these transactions makes it difficult for investigators to recover stolen assets.In February 2025, Bybit, a major cryptocurrency exchange, suffered a significant security breach resulting in the theft of about $1.5 billion worth of cryptocurrencies. The attackers, attributed to the Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking organization, employed various crypto mixers, including Wasabi, CryptoMixer, Railgun and Tornado Cash, to launder portions of the stolen assets. Despite efforts to trace the funds, a significant portion remains unaccounted for, highlighting the challenges posed by mixers in cybersecurity investigations.                  Are crypto mixers legal?              The legal status of cryptocurrency mixers depends largely on the jurisdiction and context of their use.Most governments impose strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing regulations on financial services, including digital currency services. Mixers, by their nature, complicate AML compliance because they obscure transaction trails.For instance,In the European Union, the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD) includes digital currency providers under its regulatory scope, requiring them to perform KYC checks and report suspicious activity.In the United States, FinCEN classifies cryptocurrency mixers as money transmitters, requiring registration and compliance with AML regulations. Unlicensed mixers can face severe penalties and criminal charges.Legal uses vs misuseUsing a mixer for privacy reasons is not inherently illegal. However, if mixers are used to launder proceeds from crimes, authorities will prosecute offenders. Similarly, operating a mixer without appropriate licenses or regulatory oversight can be illegal.If you choose to use a mixer, make sure you understand the legal implications in your country and avoid any activity that could be linked to money laundering or fraud.Did you know? Crypto mixer transactions are still taxable. Using a mixer doesn’t hide gains from tax authorities; failing to report them can trigger audits or penalties. Always keep records and understand your local tax obligations.                  How to stay safe and avoid scam-linked mixers              If you decide to use a cryptocurrency mixer, your safety and security should be paramount. Here are some essential tips to avoid scams and legal troubles:Choose reputable mixers: Conduct thorough research. Look for mixers with good reviews, transparent operations and clear compliance policies.Avoid unknown or suspicious services: Steer clear of mixers linked to scams, hacks or regulatory actions.Check for licensing and compliance: Prefer mixers that comply with AML/KYC regulations, especially if you are a business or high-value user.Understand fees and timelines: Be clear on the fees involved and the expected time for your funds to be returned after mixing.Use hardware wallets and strong security practices: Always safeguard your private keys and use hardware wallets to minimize risks.Stay updated on regulations: Laws surrounding crypto mixers evolve rapidly. Staying informed will help you avoid inadvertent legal violations.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-mixer-and-how-does-it-work?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T12:00:15.000Z,"StarkWare launches mobile-friendly zero-knowledge prover","Blockchain company StarkWare has unveiled zero-knowledge (ZK) prover STARK Two (S-two), enabling enhanced privacy and verification on everyday devices like phones, laptops and browsers. The company said the new ZK prover allows users to generate complex cryptographic proofs from the client side. This means users can generate ZK-proofs directly on their devices instead of relying on a server or cloud infrastructure, opening the door for faster and more private applications across the internet. “S-two will bring STARK proving to everyday devices, and open the door for new real-world proving use cases,” said Eli Ben-Sasson, StarkWare co-founder and CEO, adding that the tool could empower the next wave of ZK applications. The company said the ZK prover is now available in public alpha and is set to roll out on Starknet, its Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, later this year.  StarkWare says new ZK prover is 39 times faster than old solutions StarkWare said that benchmark tests for the S-two ZK prover showed that it was 39 times faster than previous solutions. The performance leap enables smoother experiences in privacy-enhancing applications. The upgrade also allows use cases in private transactions, ZK-based identity and verifiable artificial intelligence. StarkWare said S-two runs on CPUs, GPUs and will soon be on browsers. “For years we’ve called the prover our magic wand, a tool that transforms complex computation into a simple proof,” Ben-Sasson said. “Now, the wand has become a lightsaber in your pocket, something anyone can wield, instantly, from your own device.”According to StarkWare, developers can build with S-two, adding that its alpha release supports hardware targets. Furthermore, the company said ZK ecosystem participants like Kakarot, Nexus, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs have already adopted the technology. Kakarot uses S-two inside ETHProofs to generate Ethereum block proofs more efficiently, while Nexus is standardizing RISC-V traces to align with S-two’s architecture. Meanwhile, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs are adding GPU acceleration to push the prover’s performance even further.Use cases for S-two zero-knowledge proverStarkWare chief operating officer Oren Katz told Cointelegraph that S-two marks a shift in how ZK-proofs are used in daily lives. Generating validity proofs directly in devices will allow privacy-preserving features in messaging, payments and digital identity. “You can prove a payment was valid without showing your balance, or verify identity without revealing personal details,” Katz added. Katz said that even salary payments could be made onchain with full transparency and no exposure of sensitive information. He dubbed the development a “big step toward bringing zero-knowledge tech into the mainstream.”Beyond privacy, Katz said, local proof generation also unlocks use cases in other industries. The executive told Cointelegraph that it can allow gamers to play offline and later generate cryptographic proof of their achievements. “An operator, instead of running all logic onchain to prove integrity, can run it on their own servers and simply generate a proof that it was executed correctly,” Katz added.Related: Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden’s cashless-society rethinkNew ZK prover follows Ethereum’s privacy pushThe launch of StarWare’s upgraded ZK prover follows Ethereum’s push for better privacy.
