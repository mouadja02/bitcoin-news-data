2025-05-28T08:51:54.000Z,"HTX Research: A Fresh Look at Bitcoin Amidst Macro Changes, Featuring HTX’s New Compliant Stablecoin Offerings","BitcoinWorld HTX Research: A Fresh Look at Bitcoin Amidst Macro Changes, Featuring HTX’s New Compliant Stablecoin Offerings SINGAPORE , May 28, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — HTX Research, the research arm of HTX, has just released a crucial new report: “ The New Macroeconomic Landscape and Bitcoin Outlook: An Analysis of Liquidity, Risk Appetite, Policy Dynamics, and Investment Strategy. “ This comprehensive analysis comes at a pivotal time, as the global macroeconomic landscape undergoes profound shifts and the cryptocurrency market, especially Bitcoin’s price movements, becomes increasingly influenced by this complex backdrop. The report offers investors valuable insights, a clear market outlook, and strategic investment guidance on how evolving macroeconomic conditions are shaping the Bitcoin market. Bitcoin Outlook in the Macro Environment: Liquidity & Market Risk Appetite The current global macro environment is complex. A combination of factors, including cooling expectations for Fed rate cuts, ongoing quantitative tightening (QT), the replenishment of the U.S. Treasury General Account (TGA), and anticipated rate hikes by the Bank of Japan , are collectively contributing to tighter short-term liquidity. Over the medium term (3–12 months), liquidity is expected to gradually improve. However, uncertainty surrounding market risk appetite presents both opportunities and challenges for the Bitcoin market. Policy Tug-of-War Signals Crypto-Friendly Shifts: A Loosening Grip on Stablecoin Regulation? The ongoing policy debate is having a significant impact on the crypto market. In a notable development, Hong Kong’s Legislative Council has passed the Stablecoin Bill, which establishes a comprehensive licensing regime for fiat-backed stablecoin issuers in Hong Kong . This legislation further refines the regulatory framework for virtual asset activities within the region, aiming to foster financial stability and consumer protection. The more profound and complex policy impacts are unfolding in the United States . The Trump administration’s “Big Beautiful Tax Plan”, aimed at reducing taxes by $5 trillion over the next decade, has boosted market sentiment in the short term. However, the growing fiscal deficit and debt ceiling issues could spark liquidity volatility. Regarding regulation, the U.S. Senate is making progress on stablecoin legislation. The GENIUS Act seeks to establish a standardized framework for the stablecoin market, mandating backing by 100% high-quality asset reserves. Negotiations have reportedly reached a consensus on approximately 90% of the terms, signaling a strong bipartisan push for regulatory clarity in this critical sector. Additionally, the accelerated exploration of tokenized U.S. equities is noteworthy, with the U.S. SEC is actively researching and evaluating this space, while major financial institutions (e.g., JPMorgan) are strategically positioning themselves in this emerging field. Furthermore, U.S. federal and state initiatives to legislate “strategic Bitcoin reserves,” such as New Hampshire’s H.B. 302 bill, are further elevating Bitcoin’s strategic importance and providing policy support for increased institutional participation. These developments collectively indicate a growing recognition and integration of digital assets within traditional financial and governmental structures. HTX Lists USD1 and Other Compliant Stablecoins, Introduces Zero-Fee Conversion With global policy easing on the horizon and a growing push for regulatory clarity, stablecoins are increasingly solidifying their role as the foundation of liquidity and value pegs within the crypto market. Recognizing this pivotal opportunity, HTX has recently launched a range of compliant stablecoins, including USD1 (World Liberty Financial USD), USDQ (Quantoz), EURQ (Quantoz), USDR (StablR), EURR (StablR),and AETHUSDT (Aave Ethereum USDT). This expansion is designed to meet diverse user investment preferences and boost capital efficiency. To celebrate the launch of USD1 and reduce barriers to user participation, HTX is offering a special zero-fee conversion service. From now until December 31, 2025 , at 15:59 (UTC), users can trade the USD1 /USDT spot pair with no trading fees. This initiative ensures users incur no additional costs during conversion, thereby maximizing their capital utilization. The report concludes that the Bitcoin market may encounter liquidity pressures and volatility risks in the short term. However, the medium to long term holds significant potential for a rebound. This optimistic outlook is largely supported by clearer regulatory policies and growing institutional adoption. HTX will continue to closely monitor market and regulatory trends to help users seize opportunities and achieve steady growth in the complex and evolving crypto landscape.

2025-05-28T08:50:55.000Z,"El Salvador added eight additional BTC, violating IMF terms","El Salvador has purchased eight additional Bitcoins despite warnings from the IMF. The IMF recently restricted the nation from adding more crypto to its reserves as part of a loan deal. Arkham Intelligence revealed the country had reached nearly 6,200 BTC worth over $674 million. According to Arkham Intelligence, El Salvador has bought over 6,200 BTC with a market value of over $674 million. El Salvador added eight more BTC to its reserves despite the IMF warning the nation not to purchase additional crypto. On Tuesday, the IMF pushed the nation to stop crypto acquisitions as part of the conditions of a $1.4 billion loan deal. The country has, on several occasions, defied the IMF restrictions. IMF wants El Salvador to wind down crypto acquisitions EL SALVADOR JUST BOUGHT MORE BITCOIN pic.twitter.com/HlEJMkFIOW — The Bitcoin Office (@bitcoinofficesv) May 28, 2025 The new BTC acquisition announcement came shortly after the IMF and El Salvador’s officials struck an agreement on the first evaluation of the 40-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF). The review, which focused on economic reforms, revealed that the nation had met most targets. The EFF review also praised the country for improving its macroeconomic stability. The IMF said it had achieved progress on structural benchmarks. The financial organization added that it had achieved significant milestones in inflation control in El Salvador. The global financial institution also said that implementing the fiscal reform plan remained critical in creating conditions for more sustainable growth. The IMF also warned that it would strive to ensure that the crypto held in government wallets did not go beyond the greed threshold. The El Salvador government formally paused direct acquisitions of Bitcoin to comply with the IMF’s loan deal terms. However, the country’s Bitcoin Office has continued to make regular purchases. Its official website stated that legal distinction allows the office to continue to make daily Bitcoin acquisitions without undermining performance criteria. Legal reforms in El Salvador stripped Bitcoin of compulsory legal tender status but maintained it as an option currency. The nation made the legal reforms in order to satisfy the terms set by the IMF. According to the IMF, the $1.4 billion loan package would be part of a broader arrangement under the EFF, which is expected to unlock extra financial support, potentially totaling over $3.5 billion. The loan facility would also help the nation manage its public debt load, which had hit 85 percent of El Salvador’s GDP last year. Rodrigo Valdes, the Director of the IMF Western Hemisphere Department, said El Salvador would continue to comply with the terms outlined by the global financial institution. Valdes added that the nation’s commitment to non-accumulation of crypto by the overall fiscal sector was the performance criterion they had in place. El Salvador’s President publicly mocks the IMF’s suggestions The President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, refuted the terms issued by the IMF under its December loan deal agreement. Bukele mocked the IMF’s suggestions just days after the global financial institution revealed new terms that seek to apply pressure on the nation. Bukele said the nation would not stop adding more BTC into its reserves. “This all stops in April.’ This all stops in June.’ This all stops in December.’ No, it’s not stopping.” Nayib Bukele, El Salvador President. The IMF’s new rules aimed to set up continuous quantitative performance criteria with a ‘ceiling of o’ on all government BTC purchases. The purchase of BTC using taxpayers’ money has previously put the nation under the scrutiny of the global financial watchdog. In 2022, the IMF urged the nation to strip Bitcoin of its legal tender status, citing risks to consumer protections and financial stability after it approved its use in 2021. In October last year, the IMF suggested narrowing the scope of El Salvador’s Bitcoin Law. The global financial institution said that limiting the reach of the country’s Bitcoin law would strengthen regulatory frameworks and limit public exposure to the digital asset. The IMF made these suggestions after the country suffered multiple credit rating downgrades by Fitch and Moody’s in 2022. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-05-28T08:40:19.000Z,"Bitcoin ETF Inflows: US Spot BTC ETFs Witness Astonishing $386.77M Surge, Marking Ninth Straight Day","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETF Inflows: US Spot BTC ETFs Witness Astonishing $386.77M Surge, Marking Ninth Straight Day Are you tracking the pulse of the crypto market ? If so, you’ve likely noticed a significant trend emerging from the world of traditional finance converging with digital assets. US spot Bitcoin ETF products are currently experiencing a robust period of growth, highlighted by a notable streak of positive investment flows. What’s Driving the Latest Bitcoin ETF Inflows ? The recent data paints a compelling picture. On May 27th, US spot Bitcoin ETF products collectively saw a substantial net inflow totaling $386.77 million. This wasn’t a one-off event; it marked the ninth consecutive day that more money flowed into these investment vehicles than out. This consistent positive trend is a strong indicator of sustained investor interest and confidence in Bitcoin as an asset class accessible through regulated financial products. Let’s break down where these BTC ETF inflows are originating and which funds are leading the charge: BlackRock’s IBIT: Once again, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) dominated the inflows, pulling in a massive $410.72 million on May 27th alone. IBIT has consistently been a top performer since its launch. Grayscale’s mini BTC: The newly launched Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) also saw positive movement, adding $36.03 million. This smaller fee product seems to be attracting capital. VanEck’s HODL: VanEck’s Bitcoin Trust (HODL) contributed positively with $7.77 million in inflows. Bitwise’s BITB: The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) recorded $1.79 million in net inflows. Valkyrie’s BRRR: Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR) rounded out the positive contributors with $0.47 million. While many funds enjoyed inflows, some experienced outflows on the same day: ARK Invest’s ARKB: The ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) saw $38.34 million exit the fund. Grayscale’s GBTC: The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which converted from a trust to an ETF, continued its trend of outflows, losing $26.87 million. This is often attributed to investors moving to lower-fee alternatives, including Grayscale’s own mini BTC. Fidelity’s FBTC: The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), another major player, experienced a modest outflow of $4.79 million. Other spot Bitcoin ETF products reported no change in their holdings for the day, indicating stable, albeit not growing, investor interest on May 27th. Why Do Consecutive BTC ETF Inflows Matter for the Crypto Market ? Nine consecutive days of net inflows is a significant streak for the US spot Bitcoin ETF market. Here’s why it’s important: Institutional Adoption: ETFs are a preferred investment vehicle for institutional investors, wealth managers, and traditional retail investors who may be hesitant to buy Bitcoin directly on crypto exchanges. Sustained inflows suggest growing adoption from these larger capital pools. Validation of Bitcoin: Consistent demand for spot Bitcoin ETF products serves as a form of validation for Bitcoin as a legitimate and desirable asset in traditional finance. Potential Price Impact: While not a direct one-to-one correlation, sustained inflows into ETFs increase the demand for underlying Bitcoin (as ETFs buy BTC to back their shares), which can contribute positively to Bitcoin’s price dynamics in the crypto market . Market Sentiment: A long streak of inflows builds positive sentiment around Bitcoin and the broader crypto space, potentially attracting more investors. The strong performance of funds like BlackRock’s IBIT highlights the competitive landscape and the success of established financial giants in capturing market share in the burgeoning Bitcoin ETF inflows sector. What’s Next for the Spot Bitcoin ETF Landscape? The current trend of positive Bitcoin ETF inflows suggests continued appetite for exposure to Bitcoin through regulated products. While daily flows can fluctuate, the sustained nine-day streak indicates underlying strength in demand. Investors and market watchers will be closely monitoring whether this trend continues and how it impacts the overall crypto market . The competition among issuers remains fierce, with fees and performance being key factors influencing investor choice. The emergence of Grayscale’s mini BTC as a fund attracting inflows, even as the larger GBTC sees outflows, demonstrates the market’s sensitivity to costs. In conclusion, the US spot Bitcoin ETF market is experiencing a period of significant positive momentum, marked by nearly $387 million in net inflows on May 27th and a remarkable nine-day streak of positive flows. This trend underscores growing institutional and retail interest, providing a bullish signal for the accessibility and adoption of Bitcoin within traditional finance and potentially influencing the broader crypto market dynamics.

2025-05-28T08:36:08.000Z,"Crypto Wallet Provider MetaMask Announces Adding a New Altcoin Network to Its Browser Extension! Here Are the Details","Crypto wallet provider MetaMask has announced that it has added native support for the Solana network to its popular web browser plugin. MetaMask Adds Native Solana Support to Browser Extension With this move, users will now be able to buy and sell Solana-based tokens via the MetaMask Extension, perform swaps, and have direct access to decentralized applications (dApps) in the Solana ecosystem. The company also announced that it will integrate Solana support into the mobile app in the coming weeks. MetaMask previously provided access to networks other than Ethereum through plugins called “Snaps,” but this new update is the first to integrate the Solana network directly into MetaMask’s main interface. “Solana is just the beginning,” MetaMask said, adding that “we aim to add support for more non-EVM networks in the coming months, eliminating the hassle of users having to juggle multiple wallets.” Bitcoin Support Also On The Way In a statement made in February, it was stated that MetaMask would offer support not only for Solana but also for the Bitcoin network in the third quarter of 2025. These steps are seen as part of the platform’s strategy to expand multi-blockchain support. With an estimated 100 million annual users, MetaMask stands out as one of the world's largest non-custodial crypto wallets. MetaMask has long been speculated about the possibility of launching its own crypto token. Joseph Lubin, CEO of parent company Consensys, stated that the MetaMask token could contribute to making the platform more decentralized in 2022. MetaMask co-founder Dan Finlay said on the Crypto Beat Podcast earlier this month that the token launch was still “uncertain,” but acknowledged that the new regulatory environment for crypto in the U.S. offers more leeway for token launches. In February, the parties in an ongoing enforcement case between MetaMask and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that they had reached a settlement. This development comes after other similar lawsuits against major crypto companies such as Coinbase and Kraken were dropped. MetaMask’s integration with Solana is considered an important step towards simplifying the user experience across different blockchains. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-28T08:30:15.000Z,"US Government Explores SHOCKING Debt-Free Bitcoin Purchase Plan","BitcoinWorld US Government Explores SHOCKING Debt-Free Bitcoin Purchase Plan Imagine this: The United States government, the world’s largest economy, is reportedly looking into buying Bitcoin. But not just any purchase – they’re exploring ways to do it without adding a single cent to the national debt. This fascinating development, if true, signals a potentially massive shift in how major nations view and interact with digital assets. According to a report from South Korean news outlet Maeil Business Newspaper, the idea was discussed by David Sacks, identified as a White House crypto czar, at the Bitcoin Conference 2025 in Las Vegas. While Sacks is widely known as a prominent venture capitalist and tech entrepreneur, not an official government appointee, the report suggests discussions around official U.S. interest in Bitcoin are taking place at high levels. What is This US Government Bitcoin Exploration All About? At its core, the report details an exploration into acquiring Bitcoin for a national strategic reserve. This isn’t a new concept globally; many countries hold reserves of gold, oil, or foreign currencies for economic stability or strategic reasons. Applying this concept to Bitcoin is where things get particularly interesting for the US government Bitcoin strategy. The key phrase here is ‘debt-free’. The report indicates that the government is studying how to redirect surplus funds from other policies towards these Bitcoin acquisitions. This approach aims to avoid the need for borrowing or increasing the federal budget deficit, aligning with a potential requirement for a ‘budget-neutral’ system, as mentioned in relation to a hypothetical executive order from President Trump regarding a national strategic Bitcoin reserve. This suggests a creative approach to integrating digital assets into national strategy, leveraging existing financial flows rather than creating new debt obligations. The implications of the US government Bitcoin involvement are vast, potentially influencing global financial markets, regulatory approaches, and the perception of Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value and strategic asset. Why Would the US Need a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve? The concept of a strategic Bitcoin reserve opens up numerous possibilities regarding national strategy and economic policy. Why would a nation like the United States consider holding significant amounts of Bitcoin? Here are a few potential reasons: Economic Hedge: Bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Holding it could provide a layer of economic security against potential instability in traditional markets or the U.S. dollar itself. National Security: In an increasingly digital world, controlling or having access to significant digital assets could be crucial for national security. It could provide leverage in a digital economy or offer alternative financial rails in times of crisis. Technological Leadership: By actively participating in the digital asset space through direct holdings, the U.S. could signal its commitment to embracing future financial technologies and potentially influence global standards and adoption. Geopolitical Tool: Bitcoin operates outside traditional financial systems controlled by nation-states. A reserve could potentially be used in geopolitical maneuvering, although the specifics of how this would work are complex and speculative. Setting a Precedent: A move by the U.S. to hold Bitcoin would lend significant legitimacy to the asset class on a global stage, potentially encouraging other nations and institutions to follow suit. The idea of a strategic Bitcoin reserve is ambitious and would require significant political will and technical infrastructure. However, the reported exploration suggests these potential benefits are being seriously considered at high levels. How Could a Debt-Free Bitcoin Purchase Plan Actually Work? The notion of a debt-free Bitcoin purchase plan is perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this report. How could the U.S. government acquire a potentially large amount of a volatile asset like Bitcoin without incurring new debt? Based on the report’s mention of ‘surplus funds’ and ‘budget-neutral’ requirements, here are some potential mechanisms being explored: Redirecting Unspent Budget Allocations: Governments often have budget surpluses in certain departments or from specific policies. These funds, if not legally earmarked for other purposes, could theoretically be reallocated. Asset Sales: The government holds various assets, from real estate to seized assets from illicit activities. Selling non-strategic assets could generate funds for Bitcoin purchases without increasing debt. Tax Revenue Windfalls: Unexpected increases in tax revenue (e.g., from economic booms or specific industry taxes) could provide a pool of surplus funds. Seized Cryptocurrency Assets: The U.S. government has already seized significant amounts of cryptocurrency from criminal activities. These assets could potentially be held in a reserve rather than sold off immediately, effectively forming a ‘debt-free’ acquisition method, although the report specifically mentions ‘purchasing’ additional Bitcoin. Specific Legislation/Policy Changes: New laws could be enacted to create dedicated funding mechanisms for digital asset acquisition that are designed to be budget-neutral over time, perhaps through fees or specific revenue streams. Implementing a debt-free Bitcoin acquisition strategy would require careful planning and likely new legislative frameworks. It moves beyond theoretical discussion into the realm of practical, albeit complex, financial engineering on a national scale. Challenges and Considerations for a Bitcoin Purchase Plan While the potential benefits of a Bitcoin purchase plan for the U.S. are significant, the challenges are equally formidable. Any move by the government into holding substantial digital assets would face intense scrutiny and require navigating complex legal, regulatory, and political landscapes. Key challenges include: Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite increasing clarity, the regulatory status of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the U.S. is still evolving. A government holding would necessitate clear legal definitions and frameworks. Political Opposition: There are diverse views on cryptocurrency within the U.S. government and among the public. A plan to buy Bitcoin could face significant political hurdles and ideological opposition. Volatility Risk: Bitcoin is known for its price volatility. Holding a large reserve would expose the government to significant potential fluctuations in value, which could be politically sensitive. Security: Securing a national reserve of Bitcoin against hacks, theft, or loss would require state-of-the-art security protocols and infrastructure, the likes of which have not been implemented on this scale for digital assets by a government. Custody Solutions: Who would hold the keys? This is a critical question for any large Bitcoin holder, and for a government, the implications are immense. Secure, transparent, and accountable custody solutions would be paramount. Public Perception: The idea of the government buying a speculative asset like Bitcoin might not sit well with all taxpayers, potentially leading to public relations challenges. Impact on Markets: Significant purchases by the U.S. government could have a substantial impact on Bitcoin’s market price and liquidity, potentially creating unintended consequences. Addressing these challenges would be critical for any successful Bitcoin purchase plan . The exploration phase likely involves assessing how these hurdles could be overcome or mitigated. What Does This Mean for White House Crypto Strategy and Beyond? The mere fact that discussions around a White House crypto strategy could involve direct Bitcoin acquisition, even if through ‘debt-free’ methods, signifies a potential shift in official thinking. Historically, government focus has been more on regulation, taxation, and exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). This report suggests a more proactive approach, viewing Bitcoin not just as something to be regulated, but potentially as an asset with strategic value. It aligns with broader global trends where nations are increasingly considering the role of digital assets in the future financial landscape. While the specific details reported via the Maeil Business Newspaper and the attribution to David Sacks require careful consideration, the underlying idea – the U.S. exploring strategic, budget-neutral Bitcoin acquisition – is highly significant. It suggests that digital assets are moving from the fringes of policy discussion to potentially becoming components of national economic and security strategy. Actionable Insights for Readers: For investors and those interested in the crypto space, this report highlights the increasing potential for institutional and even sovereign adoption of Bitcoin. Key takeaways include: Stay Informed: Follow news and official statements regarding U.S. crypto policy closely. This area is evolving rapidly. Understand the ‘Why’: Recognize the potential strategic reasons governments might consider holding Bitcoin, which goes beyond simple investment. Assess Market Impact: While speculative, any confirmed government interest or purchase could significantly impact market dynamics. Consider the Long-Term View: Reports like this reinforce the idea that Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a long-term, potentially strategic asset by powerful entities. This development, if it progresses, could reshape perceptions and accelerate the integration of Bitcoin into the global financial system in ways previously thought improbable. Conclusion: A New Era for US Government and Bitcoin? The report suggesting the U.S. government is exploring debt-free methods to purchase Bitcoin for a strategic reserve is a landmark piece of news. While details are attributed to a specific source and context (Maeil Business Newspaper, David Sacks at Bitcoin Conference 2025), the core idea signals a potential monumental shift in how a major global power might engage with digital assets. The concept of a strategic Bitcoin reserve , funded without increasing national debt through mechanisms like surplus funds, presents both exciting possibilities and significant challenges. It speaks to Bitcoin’s growing recognition as a potential store of value, a hedge, and even a tool for national strategy in the digital age. Whether this exploration leads to concrete policy remains to be seen. However, the fact that such discussions are reportedly taking place at this level underscores the increasing importance of Bitcoin and digital assets in the global economic and political landscape. It’s a development that demands attention and could herald a new era for the relationship between sovereign nations and decentralized digital currencies.

In the cryptocurrency community, getting ‘orange-pilled’ is a metaphor for someone deeply understanding and becoming convinced of the value and potential of Bitcoin, often leading to significant investment or advocacy. It’s not just about buying crypto; it’s about grasping the underlying principles of decentralization, scarcity, and resistance to traditional financial control. For the Trump family, whose wealth and business have historically been rooted in hard assets like real estate, Bitcoin initially seemed ‘a bit nebulous,’ as Don Jr. described it. This perspective is common among those accustomed to tangible wealth. The idea of value stored purely digitally can be a difficult concept to embrace at first. From Real Estate to the Crypto World: A Family’s Journey The Trump family’s traditional focus has always been on solid, physical assets. Real estate, in particular, has been central to their brand and fortune. This background provides a stark contrast to the intangible nature of digital currencies. However, their experiences after entering the political arena seem to have opened their eyes to the vulnerabilities within the existing system. Donald Trump Jr. highlighted that their family has faced challenges like debanking and de-insurance. These actions, stemming from political or other pressures, demonstrated how easily access to traditional financial services can be restricted or revoked. This personal experience served as a powerful lesson on the potential fragility of the traditional finance system, which many people take for granted. This vulnerability within traditional financial systems became a key factor in re-evaluating alternatives. While real estate remains a core asset, the inability to freely access banking or insurance services underscored the need for systems that are more resilient and less susceptible to centralized control or political pressure. Boosting Bitcoin Adoption: The Sons’ Influence It appears that Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump played a crucial role in bridging the gap between their father’s traditional asset mindset and the burgeoning crypto world . Don Jr. explicitly stated that he and Eric “definitely” influenced their father’s understanding of crypto and blockchain technology. This suggests a series of conversations, explanations, and perhaps even demonstrations to help the former President grasp the concepts. Their efforts likely focused on explaining not just how crypto works, but why it matters, especially in the context of the financial challenges their family encountered. Highlighting the decentralized nature of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, their resistance to censorship, and their potential as a store of value independent of traditional banking could have been persuasive points. This personal connection and trust likely made the ‘orange-pilling’ process more effective than general market trends or news reports. Implications for Bitcoin Adoption and Beyond The news of Donald Trump’s potential shift towards crypto, influenced by his sons, could have interesting implications. While it doesn’t automatically guarantee a specific policy stance if he were to return to office, it signals a growing awareness and potential acceptance of digital assets among influential figures. For the broader market, any positive sentiment or engagement from a high-profile individual like a former U.S. President can draw significant attention. Increased awareness among political figures could potentially lead to more informed discussions about crypto regulation and policy. Furthermore, if this leads to the Trump family publicly engaging more with digital assets, it could influence a segment of their supporters, potentially contributing to broader Bitcoin adoption among demographics that might not have previously considered cryptocurrency. This story underscores how personal experiences and trusted sources can be powerful drivers for understanding and adopting new technologies, even something as disruptive as cryptocurrency. Key Takeaways from the Trump Family’s Crypto Journey This anecdote from the Bitcoin 2025 conference offers several valuable insights: Personal Experience Matters: The challenges faced with traditional finance directly influenced their openness to alternatives. Education is Key: The sons played a vital role in educating their father about complex concepts. Shift in Perspective: Moving from tangible assets to understanding digital value requires a fundamental shift. Fragility of Centralized Systems: Debanking highlighted the risks associated with reliance on centralized financial institutions. Potential for Broader Adoption: High-profile individuals exploring crypto can increase mainstream curiosity and potentially accelerate Bitcoin adoption . While the extent of Donald Trump’s personal involvement or investment in crypto remains largely private, the revelation that his sons actively guided him into understanding this space is a significant data point. It shows that even individuals deeply rooted in traditional financial thinking can begin to explore and appreciate the potential of the crypto world , often spurred by direct experiences or trusted relationships. Summary: A Family’s Influence Sparks a Digital Interest The story shared by Donald Trump Jr. at the Bitcoin 2025 conference provides a fascinating glimpse into how personal influence and real-world financial challenges are shaping perspectives on cryptocurrency within the Trump family. From viewing Bitcoin as ‘nebulous’ to exploring its potential as a hedge against the vulnerabilities of traditional finance , the journey underscores a notable shift. The active role played by his sons in ‘orange-pilling’ the former President highlights the growing integration of digital assets into even the most traditional circles. This development could have interesting ripple effects on public perception and potentially contribute to the ongoing trend of Bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the overall crypto world .

2025-05-28T08:12:45.000Z,"Crypto Market Today: Nvidia Earnings and Fed Minutes Could Shift Bitcoin Price","The post Crypto Market Today: Nvidia Earnings and Fed Minutes Could Shift Bitcoin Price appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is entering a decisive week, with Bitcoin testing key support levels and traders closely monitoring Nvidia’s earnings and the Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes for potential catalysts. Alongside Bitcoin, XRP and Solana are also showing key technical setups. Bitcoin Holds at $108K Amid Profit-Taking Pressure Bitcoin is consolidating above $108,900, supported by a trendline in place since early April. Despite positive developments—including Circle’s IPO plans and news of a proposed $2.5 billion Bitcoin allocation by Trump Media —BTC has been unable to reclaim the $110K level. Glassnode data shows whales holding over 10,000 BTC have started to reduce positions, signaling light profit-taking. While broader sentiment remains positive, analysts caution that a drop below $104,000 could trigger a deeper correction toward the mid-$90,000s. Still, persistent ETF inflows continue to support Bitcoin’s long-term uptrend by absorbing market supply. Market Eyes Nvidia and Fed Minutes for Direction Investor focus is now on Nvidia’s earnings report and the Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes. Nvidia’s performance in the AI sector has historically correlated with broader risk asset trends, including crypto. A strong report could boost market sentiment and reignite upward momentum. Meanwhile, traders await the Fed’s tone on inflation and interest rates. While earlier concerns were tied to proposed tariff policies , recent delays may limit the impact of hawkish language—unless unexpected commentary emerges. XRP Holds Strong as XRPFi Ecosystem Gains Traction XRP is holding above its 200-day simple moving average, maintaining a bullish posture. Renewed interest is building around the emerging XRPFi ecosystem, powered by Ripple’s EVM-compatible sidechain and DeFi protocols like Strobe Finance. Glassnode highlights that over $2.15 billion worth of dormant XRP is held in inactive wallets. If this idle capital flows into XRPFi applications, it could stimulate growth on the XRP Ledger and lift XRP prices in the coming weeks. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Conference 2025: Winklevoss Twins Fuel $1M BTC Talk, Claim “Orange Is the New Gold” , Solana Aims for $220 If $180 Resistance Breaks Solana is gradually building upward momentum, recently testing the $187 level. According to analyst Pentoshi , SOL must convert the $180 resistance into support to target a move toward $220. The price action reflects growing confidence, but confirmation will require sustained trading above the breakout level, along with increasing user activity and on-chain adoption. Conclusion The crypto market stands at a key technical and macroeconomic crossroads. Bitcoin’s current consolidation, paired with influential external events like Nvidia’s earnings and the Fed minutes, could set the tone for short-term price direction. Meanwhile, assets like XRP and Solana show promising signs of breakout potential, supported by ecosystem growth and investor interest. As always, while long-term sentiment remains bullish, short-term volatility and policy risks should be carefully monitored. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-28T08:10:03.000Z,"KindlyMD Makes Bold Bitcoin Treasury Move, Acquires 21 BTC for $2.3M","BitcoinWorld KindlyMD Makes Bold Bitcoin Treasury Move, Acquires 21 BTC for $2.3M In a significant move signaling growing institutional interest in digital assets, KindlyMD, a U.S.-based healthcare data company, has announced a substantial investment in the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This acquisition is part of a strategic shift towards incorporating Bitcoin into its corporate treasury. What is the KindlyMD Bitcoin Acquisition? KindlyMD recently revealed its purchase of 21 Bitcoin (BTC) for approximately $2.3 million. The acquisition was made at a weighted average price of $109,027 per BTC. This investment represents a notable step for a healthcare data company entering the cryptocurrency space. The funding for this KindlyMD Bitcoin purchase came from the gross proceeds of a recent exercise of outstanding warrants. This exercise generated $8,748,370 and resulted in the issuance of 1,437,362 shares of common stock. Utilizing a portion of these funds for a Bitcoin acquisition underscores a deliberate decision by KindlyMD’s leadership. Implementing a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy The acquisition is explicitly linked to KindlyMD’s intention to implement a Bitcoin treasury strategy . This approach involves holding Bitcoin as a significant asset on the company’s balance sheet, similar to how traditional companies hold cash, gold, or other reserve assets. A Bitcoin treasury strategy can serve several purposes for a corporation: Inflation Hedge: Protecting corporate value against the potential devaluation of fiat currencies. Potential Appreciation: Gaining exposure to the potential long-term price growth of Bitcoin. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to traditional holdings. Signaling Innovation: Demonstrating forward-thinking and adaptability in a digital economy. KindlyMD’s adoption of this strategy aligns it with a growing list of public and private companies exploring or already holding Bitcoin. Why Corporate Bitcoin Adoption is on the Rise KindlyMD’s move is part of a broader trend of Corporate Bitcoin adoption . While still relatively nascent, companies across various sectors are beginning to view Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset but as a legitimate component of a modern corporate treasury. The pioneers in this space, like MicroStrategy, which holds tens of thousands of BTC, have paved the way and provided a framework for others to follow. Factors driving this trend include: Increasing macroeconomic uncertainty and inflation concerns. The maturing infrastructure surrounding Bitcoin (custody solutions, regulated exchanges). Growing acceptance and understanding of Bitcoin as a store of value. The potential for significant returns compared to low-yield traditional investments. KindlyMD, as a healthcare data company, adds an interesting dimension to the narrative of Corporate Bitcoin adoption , demonstrating that this strategy isn’t limited to tech or finance sectors. A Healthcare Company Embraces Bitcoin It’s particularly noteworthy that a Healthcare company Bitcoin purchase is making headlines. The healthcare sector is often perceived as more conservative regarding financial strategies. KindlyMD’s decision highlights a potential shift, where companies focused on data and technology within healthcare might be more open to innovative financial approaches. While the primary business of KindlyMD remains healthcare data, integrating Bitcoin into its treasury suggests a belief in the digital asset’s long-term value and its potential role in a future digital economy that may intersect with healthcare data management and transactions. The question arises: will other healthcare or data-intensive companies follow suit? KindlyMD’s move could serve as a case study for how a Healthcare company Bitcoin strategy can be implemented and managed. The Role of Nakamoto Holdings in the Merger This strategic Bitcoin acquisition is closely tied to KindlyMD’s proposed merger with Nakamoto Holdings . Nakamoto Holdings is described as a Bitcoin holding company founded by David Bailey. David Bailey is a well-known figure in the crypto space, particularly recognized for his role as a crypto advisor to U.S. President Donald Trump. His involvement and the nature of Nakamoto Holdings as a dedicated Bitcoin entity strongly suggest that the post-merger company will have a significant focus on Bitcoin, both operationally and strategically. The merger indicates a deliberate move by KindlyMD to align itself with a company deeply embedded in the Bitcoin ecosystem. This alignment likely provides expertise, resources, and a shared vision for a Bitcoin-centric future that KindlyMD might not have had independently. What Does This Mean for KindlyMD and the Market? For KindlyMD, this move solidifies its commitment to a digital asset future. It positions the company, post-merger with Nakamoto Holdings, as potentially one of the few publicly traded entities with significant exposure to both healthcare data and Bitcoin. For the broader market, this serves as another data point illustrating the increasing diversification of companies exploring or adopting Bitcoin for their balance sheets. While the 21 BTC purchase is modest compared to the holdings of major corporations, the fact that it’s a healthcare data company signals the expanding reach of Corporate Bitcoin adoption . Challenges and Considerations While the potential benefits of a Bitcoin treasury strategy are clear, companies adopting this approach also face challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile, potentially impacting the company’s balance sheet value in the short term. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Custody and Security: Securely storing significant amounts of Bitcoin requires specialized knowledge and infrastructure. Accounting Treatment: The accounting rules for holding digital assets can be complex. KindlyMD, especially through its proposed merger with Nakamoto Holdings , is likely preparing to navigate these challenges with expert guidance. Conclusion: A Strategic Step Forward KindlyMD’s acquisition of 21 BTC marks a significant strategic decision, positioning the healthcare data company at the intersection of traditional business and the digital asset economy. Fueled by proceeds from warrant exercises and anticipating a merger with Nakamoto Holdings , this move signals a firm commitment to a Bitcoin treasury strategy . As more companies explore Corporate Bitcoin adoption , KindlyMD’s example, particularly as a Healthcare company Bitcoin holder, provides a unique case study. It highlights the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate corporate asset and underscores the evolving financial strategies of businesses looking towards the future. This development is a testament to the growing maturity of the Bitcoin ecosystem and its potential to integrate with diverse industries.

Analysts Say Sideways Action Is About To End","Following a notable performance over the past 24 hours, Ethereum (ETH) is attempting to reclaim a key level as support. Some analysts suggest a breakout toward the $3,000 mark could be coming if the $2,600 mark holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) To Continue Price Discovery Rally If It Holds These Levels – Analyst Ethereum Prepares For Massive Breakout On Tuesday, Ethereum surged to the $2,700 resistance after a 6.3% price jump in the daily timeframe. The cryptocurrency climbed from the $2,500 support zone toward the recent resistance level, hitting the $2,712 mark before retracing. ETH has been unable to cross this zone after recording its three-month high of $2,738 two weeks ago, halting its retest of higher horizontal levels. Notably, the King of Altcoins has surged over 50% in the past month and around 98% from April’s lows. Amid the May crypto market rally, which saw Bitcoin hit a new All-Time High (ATH) of $111,953 last week, Ethereum has traded sideways for most of the month, hovering between the $2,450-$2,600 price range. Nonetheless, ETH has outperformed Bitcoin so far during the second quarter, registering a 47.78% increase since April started. Analyst The Cryptonomist pointed out that Ethereum has broken above the $2,600 level, signaling that a reclaim of this level could conclude ETH’s sideways action between its current price range and propel its price toward the $3,400 mark. Similarly, Crypto Bullet affirmed that ETH is “about to break out and fill the big CME Gap.” According to the chart, the Altcoin appears to be forming a symmetrical triangle over the past few weeks, and is currently attempting to break out from the formation. A successful breakout and retest of the $2,700 level could send ETH’s price to the CME GAP levels, between $2,900 and $3,350, which other analysts also believe will be filled soon. ETH Dominance To Surge In June? Meanwhile, analyst Rekt Capital noted that Ethereum Dominance is “showcasing initial signs of trying to hold the ~9% level as support,” suggesting a potential bullish performance in June. As the analyst explained, ETH dominance has bounced since dropping to new All-Time Lows (ATL) last month, playing out “the full extent of its September 2019 upside.” Keeping this level as support could propel the cryptocurrency to a more market-dominant performance next month, resembling its 2019 playbook. Related Reading: Indecisive Close For Litecoin, But The Real Story Lies In BTC.D’s Next Move Market watcher Merlijn The Trader affirmed that Ethereum’s chart “is screaming bullish,” showing a multi-year base and “clean” bullish pennant pattern. To the trader, this setup could launch the cryptocurrency to a long-term target of $8,000 after breaking above the $3,000 mark. Additionally, ETH is preparing for the cycle’s “final pump,” according to Merlijn, based on its previous performances. He pointed out that Ethereum “goes vertical” after breaking its previous high every cycle. As of this writing, Ethereum trades at $2,686, an 8.8% increase in the weekly timeframe.

2025-05-28T08:00:10.000Z,"Bitcoin Multisig Pioneer Asigna Secures Crucial $3M Crypto Funding","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Multisig Pioneer Asigna Secures Crucial $3M Crypto Funding In the ever-evolving world of digital assets, the need for robust security solutions is paramount. For holders of Bitcoin, the original and most prominent cryptocurrency, protecting their holdings is a constant priority. This is where innovative approaches like Bitcoin Multisig come into play, offering enhanced layers of protection beyond standard single-signature wallets. A significant development in this space recently occurred with the announcement that Asigna, a platform focused on smart multisig vaults for Bitcoin and its layer-2 protocols, has successfully closed a substantial seed funding round. Understanding the Asigna Platform and its Importance At its core, the Asigna Platform is designed to provide a sophisticated, non-custodial solution for managing Bitcoin. Traditional Bitcoin wallets rely on a single private key to authorize transactions. If that key is compromised, lost, or stolen, the funds are at risk. Multisig, or multi-signature, wallets require multiple keys to authorize a transaction. For example, a 2-of-3 multisig wallet requires at least two out of three designated keys to sign off on a transaction. Asigna takes this concept further with its ‘smart’ multisig vault. While the specifics of their ‘smart’ features were not detailed in the initial announcement, this often implies additional capabilities built into the multisig script or associated tools. These could include: More flexible signing policies Time-locks or conditional spending rules Integration with identity or recovery mechanisms Enhanced scripting capabilities for complex use cases The platform is specifically built for Bitcoin and its growing ecosystem of layer-2 protocols, such as the Lightning Network or Liquid. This focus is crucial as layer-2 solutions gain traction for faster and cheaper transactions, but still require secure management of the underlying Bitcoin. By offering a dedicated, smart multisig solution for these layers, Asigna aims to fill a critical gap in the infrastructure needed for Bitcoin’s continued adoption and scalability. Fueling Growth: The $3M Crypto Funding Round The announcement that Asigna has raised Crypto Funding to the tune of $3 million in a seed round signals strong investor confidence in their approach and the market need for advanced Bitcoin security solutions. The round was notably led by prominent firms in the digital asset investment space, including Hivemind Capital and Tykhe Block Ventures. They were joined by other significant participants such as Sats Ventures and Trust Machines, among others. The involvement of investors like Trust Machines is particularly noteworthy. Trust Machines is a company focused on building on the Bitcoin network, highlighting a strategic interest in foundational infrastructure that enhances Bitcoin’s capabilities and security. The participation of such focused investors suggests that they see Asigna’s technology as a key component in the future development and secure use of Bitcoin and its layer-2 ecosystem. While the press release did not disclose the specific intended use of the funds, seed funding typically supports key areas essential for a startup’s growth: Expanding the engineering and development team to build out the platform’s features. Investing in security audits and infrastructure to ensure the vault’s integrity. Developing marketing and sales efforts to reach potential users (individuals, businesses, institutions). Exploring integrations with more layer-2 protocols and ecosystem partners. This capital infusion provides Asigna with the resources needed to accelerate its development roadmap and bring its smart multisig technology to a wider audience. Boosting Bitcoin Security for a Decentralized Future The core value proposition of Asigna lies in enhancing Bitcoin Security . For many users, managing a single private key is a significant responsibility and risk. Losing the key means losing access to funds permanently. A single point of failure also makes users vulnerable to hacking or theft if their key is compromised. Multisig significantly mitigates these risks. By requiring multiple keys, held by different individuals or stored in different locations, it becomes much harder for a single point of failure to result in loss. This is particularly valuable for: Joint Accounts: Families or partners can require multiple signatures for spending. Business Treasuries: Companies can require multiple executives to approve transactions, preventing single-person fraud or errors. Inheritance Planning: Keys can be distributed among trusted parties to ensure funds can be accessed if the primary owner is incapacitated or deceased. Decentralized Organizations (DAOs): Community members can collectively manage funds through multisig voting mechanisms. Asigna’s focus on ‘smart’ multisig suggests they are building features that go beyond basic multi-signature requirements, potentially automating certain processes or adding conditional logic that further strengthens security and control for these complex use cases. Integrating this technology with layer-2 solutions means that as more value and activity shift to these faster networks, the underlying security infrastructure is already in place. The Power of Non-Custodial Control A defining characteristic of the Asigna Platform is its commitment to being Non-Custodial . This is a critical concept in the cryptocurrency space and directly relates to security and user control. A custodial service is one where a third party holds your private keys on your behalf. Examples include centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. While convenient, this means you do not have direct control over your funds; you are trusting the custodian to keep your keys safe and allow you access when you request it. If the custodian is hacked, goes bankrupt, or freezes your account, your funds are at risk. In contrast, a Non-Custodial solution like Asigna ensures that the user retains control of their private keys at all times. Asigna provides the software and framework for setting up and managing the multisig vault, but they do not hold any of the keys required to spend the Bitcoin. This aligns with the core ethos of Bitcoin – empowering individuals with direct control over their financial assets without relying on intermediaries. The challenge with non-custodial solutions, especially multisig, has historically been complexity. Setting up and managing multiple keys, understanding the backup procedures, and coordinating signatures can be daunting for average users. Platforms like Asigna aim to simplify this process, making the benefits of non-custodial multisig more accessible while still preserving the user’s ultimate control over their keys and funds. This balance between security, control, and usability is key to driving broader adoption. What’s Next for Asigna? Navigating Challenges and Opportunities With the successful Crypto Funding round complete, Asigna is positioned to accelerate its development and market penetration. The capital infusion allows them to invest heavily in technology, talent, and user experience. Potential future developments could include expanding the range of supported layer-2 protocols, adding more advanced ‘smart’ features to the vaults, developing partnerships within the Bitcoin ecosystem, and enhancing the platform’s usability to onboard more users. However, challenges remain. Educating users about the importance and mechanics of multisig and non-custodial solutions is an ongoing effort. Ensuring the platform remains secure against sophisticated attacks is paramount. Furthermore, competition in the Bitcoin infrastructure space is growing, requiring Asigna to differentiate itself effectively. Despite these challenges, the opportunity is significant. As Bitcoin matures as an asset class, the demand for professional-grade, secure, and user-friendly management tools will only increase. Institutions, corporations, and high-net-worth individuals are increasingly looking for robust ways to hold Bitcoin securely, and solutions like Asigna’s smart multisig vaults are directly addressing this need. The focus on layer-2 also positions them well for the future growth of the Bitcoin network’s transaction capacity and utility. Conclusion: A Step Forward for Bitcoin Security Asigna’s successful $3 million seed funding round marks a notable step forward for the infrastructure supporting Bitcoin Security and management. By focusing on a non-custodial, smart Bitcoin Multisig vault for the base layer and layer-2 protocols, the Asigna Platform is tackling critical needs for enhanced control and protection of digital assets. The significant Crypto Funding secured from reputable investors underscores the perceived value and potential of their solution in the market. As the platform develops, it holds the promise of making advanced, secure Bitcoin management more accessible, contributing to the overall maturity and safety of the Bitcoin ecosystem for individuals and institutions alike.

Here Are the Details","Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas that artificial intelligence will bring about radical changes in company structures. Robinhood CEO: AI Will Transform Entrepreneurship, “One-Man Companies Like Satoshi” Are Coming According to Tenev, in the near future, “one-person companies” could become the norm thanks to artificial intelligence, just like Bitcoin’s mysterious inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto. Tenev likened this new AI-powered startup model to Nakamoto single-handedly creating Bitcoin. “We’re going to see more one-person companies. They’re going to be tokenized and traded on the blockchain, just like any other asset,” he said. “So it’s going to be possible to invest economically in a person or a project that that person is running.” “This is essentially like Bitcoin itself,” Tenev said, “Satoshi Nakamoto’s personal brand is powered by technology.” “Artificial intelligence will add more value with fewer resources” There have been suggestions for years that AI will simplify how companies operate. But Tenev focused on the opportunities it provides for entrepreneurs rather than its potential to replace the workforce. “One of the things that AI makes possible is that it produces more and more value with fewer and fewer resources,” he said. Bitcoin, which was founded with the technical document published by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, quickly produced a global digital economy. This adventure, which began with the mining of the first block in 2009, has today turned into a trillion-dollar crypto asset industry. Blockchain technology is now being used not only in financial transactions but also in many areas such as supply chain tracking, tokenization of digital artworks, and in-game assets. For example, Walmart is using blockchain to increase traceability in its supply chain. Robinhood is a trading platform where users can buy and sell stocks, commodities, and cryptocurrencies. The company has stepped up its crypto activities in recent years; its platform trades a variety of cryptocurrencies as well as memecoins. Tenev's statements strengthened expectations that artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies could combine to usher in a new era in entrepreneurship. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-28T07:55:13.000Z,"Week in GameFi: Bitcoin Hits All-Time High, But Web3 Gaming Misses the Momentum","Although Bitcoin grabbed the attention this week with a stunning surge past $112,000, there has been little fanfare for the GameFi sector. Despite an overall bullish sentiment now pulsating through the crypto markets, Web3 gaming assets have had a hard time keeping up. Trading volumes have tanked, and a couple of recent scandals have raised some eyebrows. All in all, the week was a pretty stark reminder of how up and down the GameFi world is right now. Bitcoin Breaks Records, GameFi Barely Reacts The broader cryptocurrency landscape could hardly have been more favorable. Waves of optimism washed around the digital asset space in the wake of Bitcoin’s all-time high close to $112K. Yet GameFi—a sector long associated with the speculative altcoin cycles—barely stirred in response to the recent Bitcoin rally. Ecosystem tokens across the Web3 gaming space saw only a modest 4 percent uptick, while worries mounted that trading volumes had plummeted by 22 percent—a sign, perhaps, that the lack of retail and institutional enthusiasm for gaming tokens might continue to hold the ecosystem back, even as capital floods into the broader market. Even the CMC Altcoin Index, a barometer of altcoin sector performance, crept up just a single point, moving from 27 to 28. The lack of movement illustrates a larger stagnation within the altcoin ecosystem, with GameFi especially struggling. DeFiLlama reports that GameFi has fallen in sector narrative rankings from 13th to 14th, which indicates that interest and influence in GameFi has continued to wane. Guild of Guardians Defies the Trend with Triple-Digit Gains Although most of the GameFi sector stayed gloomy, Guild of Guardians (GOG) pulled off an unbelievable feat. The token shot up a staggering 286 percent over the week, easily leaving its peers in the dust and obviously being the top performer in the gaming category. The surge has once more brought attention to GOG’s gameplay model and future roadmap, though one has to question whether it can keep delivering. A handful of other undertakings also eluded the prevailing pessimistic atmosphere: MASK: up to 40 percent OL: up 27 percent VIRTUALS: increased by 17 percent. Week in GameFi: Web3 Gaming Misses the BTC Boost BTC breaks $112K! But GameFi stays lukewarm! GOG soars 286%! Trading volumes plunge 22%! Let’s unpack what went down in the Web3 gaming world this week. pic.twitter.com/EhP4dHNO8m — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) May 26, 2025 Nevertheless, some were not so fortunate. Steering gains, NEXPACE, which led the previous week, reversed course and dropped 21 percent as traders rotated capital into newer opportunities. This signals and suggests for investors that GameFi is not as stable as it may seem. A lead kind of capital you can control like Grayscale won’t guarantee a rise in GameFi tokens. And that may indicate for investors that GameFi is not as stable a sector as one might have thought. These stark reversals and single-project supremacy showcase GameFi’s present vulnerability — where victories are dispersed, and overall industry sentiment is still lackluster. Scandals and Slow Rebuilds Undermine Confidence GameFi also received unwelcome press this week with the arrest of Vladimir Smerkis, co-founder of Blum, on charges stemming from large-scale financial fraud involving earlier ventures. Blum was quick to clarify that Smerkis does not work for them anymore, but the reputational hit is likely to stick. Whether potential investors or new users are thinking about the gaming aspect or the financial aspect of GameFi, news like this makes them question whether the whole thing is worth their time and money. In the meantime, platforms are busily restoring trust and engagement. WEMIX, a foremost GameFi project, took a significant step toward reactivating its user base and regaining momentum after a high-profile hack earlier this year by unveiling a new Mission System. In a different part of the Web3 world, BOXCAT announced not long ago that it would debut on Gate.io, giving an airdrop to holders of the exchange’s GT token—a modest but tokenomic effort to boost initial traction. These developments might not propel markets in overnight manners, but they do signal a rebuilding phase for GameFi. After the recent explosive growth and the speculative hype that accompanied it, many GameFi platforms seem to be returning to fundamentals. They are focusing on community engagement, platform security, and gradual ecosystem expansion. While Bitcoin’s command of the headlines and capital expressing itself in the GameFi domain, GameFi finds itself at a bit of a crossroads. The muted sector reaction to a record-breaking week in crypto amplifies the clarity of the situation: Challenges lie ahead, challenges that, if met successfully, lead to a destination called User Trust and Interest That is Not Just Hype. What the market wants to see now is proof that Web3 games can deliver actual lasting value. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

In a May 28 announcement , the company said it was raising $50 million through bonds. The bonds are issued in $1.25 million denominations and carry no interest. Investors will not receive regular payments, with any potential profit expected to come from the bonds’ redemption value. Evo Fund, a Cayman Islands-based investment firm, will be the sole bondholder. The investment company has been Metaplanet’s primary backer for its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, subscribing to multiple rounds of Metaplanet’s zero-interest bonds, providing capital for its Bitcoin ( BTC ) buys. The bonds are unsecured and not guaranteed, with neither a bond administrator nor collateral. This reflects the high degree of trust between the two companies. It also shows confidence in BTC’s long-term outlook as Metaplanet continues to increase its holdings. Excerpt of Metaplanet’s announcement to issue zero-interest bonds to buy Bitcoin. Source: Metaplanet Metaplanet expects minimal impact on 2025 results Metaplanet said it expects the issuance to have minimal impact on its 2025 financial results, though it will disclose further developments if needed. Metaplanet’s push into Bitcoin highlights a growing trend among companies seeking alternatives to fiat-based treasury strategies. The move follows Metaplanet’s second-biggest BTC purchase , scooping up 1,004 Bitcoin worth over $100 million. This pushed the company’s Bitcoin holdings to 7,800 BTC, worth over $800 million. According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET, Metaplanet is up by nearly 20% on its Bitcoin investments. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin strategy has also given its stock price a boost .

2025-05-28T07:47:27.000Z,"Solana Leads in Capital Inflows Despite Declining Activity as Chain Competition Intensifies","May has been a month of mixed blessings for Solana . While the network saw a major inflow from centralized exchanges, to the tune of $1.1 billion—that’s the most since 2024; its on-chain transaction activity keep declining. Now, two key things here: 1. The inflow is a sign that investor interest is on the uptick, at least. 2. The fact that transaction activity on the chain is going down in spite of this inflow signals a divergence between investor interest and network utility that is rarely seen. BREAKING: @Solana saw an inflow of $1.1 billion from centralized exchanges in May alone, the largest monthly inflow since 2024. pic.twitter.com/Fh9eIZkBIx — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) May 27, 2025 And from where I’m sitting, that ain’t great. Solana Sees Historic Inflows Amid Transaction Decline In May, Solana drew in an astonishing $1.1 billion in capital from centralized exchanges, cementing its status as a go-to blockchain for institutions and retail investors. This figure represents the highest monthly inflow recorded since 2024 and occurs during a period when the entire crypto sector seems to be favoring high-throughput, low-fee chains. Even with this strong indication, Solana’s transaction volumes tell another tale. Per the data of OKX Explorer covering May 18 to 24, Solana carried out 2.37 billion transactions, down 8.24 percent week-over-week. This was the third week in a row of Solana having less “activity.” Even though this statement does not carry a good connotation, it does not make Solana’s numbers look bad at all. In fact, the number of raw transactions that Solana handles is vastly greater than those of competing chains. And even with these “bad” numbers, Solana is still a blockchain that you would want to be a part of. This divergence raises some big issues. Is it the case that users are becoming less active at the same time that capital is rushing into the ecosystem? We could be looking at something totally normal and healthy, with all this new money speculating on the ecosystem, in anticipation of upcoming applications or market catalysts—rather than something that’s representative of any sort of growth in everyday usage of Solana right now. On the flip side, if this new money is representative of actual new use cases for Solana, then where are all these new users of upcoming applications participating in Solana’s ongoing speculative economy? Competitors Catching Up as Solana’s Grip Weakens While Solana’s on-chain activity is decreasing, other blockchain networks are getting more active. The standout is clearly BNB Chain, which saw 53 million transactions last week—up 5.36 percent from the prior week. This was its third consecutive week of positive growth, with transaction activity rising 54 percent, then 2 percent, and now another 5 percent. BNB’s Chains steady climb should be interpreted as a rise in user engagement, which might be driven by DeFi applications, token launches, or the still-growing number of Binance-led initiatives. Polygon also had a strong showing, amassing 24.7 million transactions and vaulting 9.31 percent over the week. That comes on the heels of a three-week run totaling an 18 percent increase, putting Polygon atop the mid-tier performer ranking. Top 8 Chains by Weekly Total Txn OKX Explorer | May 18-24 Weekly Trends: @solana : 2.37B (-8.24% WoW) — Drop for 3 consecutive weeks; dominance erodes further. @fractal_bitcoin : 91.8M (-7.82% WoW ) — Volatility spikes after +2% rebound last week, but still holding a… pic.twitter.com/ACzNJYSYPb — OKX Explorer (@okxexplorer) May 27, 2025 Its low fees, along with its compatibility with Ethereum-based tools, keep developers and users piling into the ecosystem, with that flood largely dominated by the gaming and NFT sectors. At the same time, Base—the Ethereum Layer 2 created by Coinbase—had 59.3 million transactions but a 5.95 percent drop. This marked the halt of a five-week growth streak and may have signaled the beginning of a short-term correction. Base is still new, and this is a relatively calm period for it, which is tied closely to the destiny of Coinbase and what it decides to integrate and do in the future. Broader Ecosystem Faces Volatility and Fluctuation Other notable chains experienced similar conditions. Fractal Bitcoin, a volume-driven but not particularly “run-of-the-mill” platform, executed 91.8 million trades—a 7.82 percent drop after a minor rebound the prior week that hardly deserves mentioning. Even with that close-to-static status, Fractal Bitcoin retained its total-ahead-of-totals status versus Solana by remaining a stricter rule-following platform. Thus, among second-tier platforms, Fractal Bitcoin seems the most likely candidate for a kind of “pause that refreshed” scenario. Sui Network and Aptos, two younger Layer 1 blockchains, both continued to have some headwinds. Sui dropped another 2.87 percent in weekly transaction count, bringing its three-week decline to 9 percent. Aptos remained mostly flat at 26 million transactions, offering very little indication of renewed momentum after a brief stabilization phase. Tron also saw a setback hit it, with its 24.7 million weekly transactions coming in at an 8.05 percent drop. This netted out the week-before gains, and in the end, it highlighted the erratic nature of user activity on old, high-throughput chains. Even though transaction activity is down, inflows to Solana are at an all-time high. This must mean that there is still confidence in the Solana network, and confidence in it as a long-term vehicle for value. Solana is up against some stiff competition, though. The performance of not just Solana but all Layer 1 networks will be closely scrutinized in the coming weeks to see if they can maintain their upswell of interest and not just be faddish at the Layer 1 level while Layer 2 is winning the competitive race.

2025-05-28T07:43:33.000Z,"Bitcoin cements its haven asset reputation. Is the “means of exchange” narrative still alive?","Bitcoin has always been compared to gold. As time went by, the safe haven reputation of Bitcoin only strengthened. However, Bitcoin was conceived as an alternative cash system, and Bitcoin enthusiasts still greet businesses that have started accepting bitcoins. What are the chances that Bitcoin will eventually become a regular means of exchange? Safe haven assets: Bitcoin and gold Gold has been recognized as a safe haven for a long time, meaning that it successfully preserves value in times of financial turbulence, serving as a strong hedge against inflation. Bitcoin, sometimes referred to as digital gold, is something new in this regard. Multiple investors and financial experts went so far as to call Bitcoin a better version of gold. Both assets are scarce and hard to produce. Gold is finite, and Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million, most of which is already in circulation and around three million are lost forever. As for the advantages of Bitcoin over gold, cryptocurrency is extremely easy to manage. Gold bars need special storage. Maintenance of gold bars is demanding and costly. More than that, gold needs space. Bitcoin is much more comfortable as you may always have it with you as long as you obtain a seed phrase of your wallet or private and public keys. Bitcoin can be stored in a trustless manner. For gold, you will probably have to trust professionals. Sending gold is way harder and more expensive than sending a Bitcoin transaction. Another characteristic that makes Bitcoin way different from gold is value dynamics. Bitcoin has an element of gambling to it, as its price is pretty volatile. However, as institutional investors and governments are joining the hunt for Bitcoin, the price stabilizes without losing its upward direction. Many say that this cycle will be different from the previous ones, meaning that major ups and downs of Bitcoin will probably become a thing of the past. Read more: 2025 is no longer about cycles — Bitcoin is reading something else entirely Gold has a long-term price appreciation, too, and does not have the volatility of Bitcoin. More than that, during the economic turmoil triggered by Donald Trump’s tariff policies, gold spiked immensely, not Bitcoin. It signals that investors trust gold more than Bitcoin. Gold slipped after Trump softened EU tariff threats — a reminder that its haven status now bends to politics. Meanwhile, $BTC held steady amid rising deficits, rating downgrades, and macro chaos (even touching new ATH's along the way) Is Bitcoin the new flight to safety? — Bitcoin.com News (@BTCTN) May 26, 2025 One of the reasons behind gold’s strength is that its price doesn’t correlate with the stock market movements but rather grows slowly and intensifies when people expect hard times. Bitcoin is tied to stock prices more clearly. Finally, gold is familiar to most people and leans to more established regulations. Uncertainty in Bitcoin regulation is turning some of the potential investors away. Bitcoin as a means of exchange While some insist that Bitcoin is not good for payments but great as a savings currency, many in the crypto community argue that Bitcoin derives its value from being used as a means of exchange. In 2021, Tesla made a revolutionary step when it announced that its vehicles could be purchased for Bitcoin. However, soon after, the company withdrew its decision, citing the environmental impact of Bitcoin as the reason. In the U.S., many big and small businesses accept Bitcoin. Notable examples are Apple, Microsoft, Starbucks, PayPal, Netflix, and many others. https://twitter.com/Sina_21st/status/1925639079380545849?t=l8gtykYOZT0FISuY3QYiEg&s=35 However, despite various advantages, Bitcoin’s use as a means of exchange is limited by a relatively small share of merchants accepting BTC. According to Bitdegree, Bitcoin is accepted by 15,000 businesses around the world, of which over 2,000 are based in the U.S. On top of that, the network capacity of Bitcoin is too small for a means of exchange used by the masses. It can process only up to seven transactions per second. For comparison, Visa is capable of processing over 65,000 transactions per second. It is accepted in over 46 million merchant locations. Nevertheless, the Bitcoin community was never going to get over it. For years, developers have been working on solutions to scale Bitcoin up for higher adoption as a means of exchange. The most well-known project aimed at solving Bitcoin’s scalability issues is Lightning Network. LN is a layer-2 protocol that enables fast and cheap transactions using off-chain transactions for this purpose. Surprisingly, even the name of the smallest denomination of Bitcoin became the battleground within the crypto community. Originally, the one hundred-millionth particle of Bitcoin was called Satoshi (or sats), after Satoshi Nakamoto, a mysterious creator of Bitcoin. A new proposal suggests that the name “bits” will fit better. Prepaid crypto debit cards are moving Bitcoin spending forward. They allow clients to hold BTC right on the banking card and spend it anywhere where the cards are accepted. Bitcoins are turned into fiat money automatically and exchanged. As prepaid cryptocurrency cards continue to occur and more businesses jump on the Bitcoin train, BTC will become an easier choice as a means of exchange. However, its role as capital or savings money will persist.

2025-05-28T07:40:30.000Z,"Two crypto investors charged with kidnapping and torturing a man for his Bitcoin password","Police have apprehended two crypto investors who were allegedly involved in the kidnapping and torturing of an Italian man in a Manhattan townhouse. The victim claimed his captors forced him to reveal his Bitcoin account password. According to a recent report by AP News, 32-year-old William Duplessie has surrendered to the police over the alleged kidnapping of a man who claimed he was tortured for weeks in a posh New York townhouse by crypto investors seeking to extort his Bitcoin ( BTC ) funds. Duplessie is the second alleged culprit to be apprehended by the police. He faces charges of kidnapping, assault, unlawful imprisonment and criminal possession of a weapon. His accomplice, fellow crypto investor John Woeltz, was taken into custody four days earlier after the victim managed to escape their grasp. Duplessie is known online as the co-founder and head of sourcing at Pangea Blockchain Fund and an avid investor in blockchain firms. While Woeltz has described himself as a blockchain investor who spent time in Silicon Valley before becoming involved in the crypto mining sector in Kentucky. On May 23, a 28-year-old Italian man found by a traffic agent at the side of the road. Bloodied and barefoot, the victim claimed to have been beaten, drugged, shocked with electricity and threatened with death for nearly three weeks in an eight-bedroom townhouse located in Soho, Manhattan. According to the police, the victim was lured to the townhouse by Duplessie and Woeltz on May 6. The two crypto investors allegedly attempted to extort the man to give up his Bitcoin account password.

At one point, he said he was even dangled from the top of the stairs. Believing he would be killed soon if he did not comply to their demands, the victim agreed on Friday morning to reveal his Bitcoin account password to the captors. When the two men went to get the victim’s computer, the victim managed to escape from the home. He is currently hospitalized for his injuries that appeared consistent with the evidence authorities found in the Manhattan townhouse. In the past few weeks, there have been a series of violent crimes involving crypto investors and industry leaders. Most recently, on May 27, the French police detained more than 12 suspects for their alleged involvement in two Paris kidnapping attempts involving a crypto entrepreneur and a crypto exchange CEO.

Sharing the stage with prominent journalists, the Winklevoss twins drew attention for their bold forecast of Bitcoin’s future value. Winklevoss Twins Predict $1M Bitcoin During the event, the twins predicted that Bitcoin could eventually reach $1 million , referring to it as “orange is the new gold” — a statement positioning BTC as a superior digital store of value compared to traditional assets like gold. As early adopters and co-founders of the Gemini exchange, their views carry significant influence in the cryptocurrency space.

2025-05-28T07:39:03.000Z,"Bitcoin Whale Count Climbs as Price Hits New All-Time High, Miner Selling Accelerates","Bitcoin is showing once again why it’s the most impressive financial instrument of our times. Ever since it surpassed $64,000 for the first time in mid-April, it has continued climbing, recently hitting price levels around $68,000. And it’s not just the price itself that is impressive, but rather the number of influential participants in the ecosystem and how they’ve been behaving along with the price. Ostensibly, the price seems to be signaling powerfully in one direction: up. But you can never understand market dynamics purely through price. In this case, you do have to look under the hood. And what you’re finding underneath the Bitcoin hood tends to reinforce belief that this price uptick is undergirded as much by power dynamics in the ecosystem as it is by just plain old price action. Bitcoin Whales on the Rise Amid New Price Milestone Bitcoin whales, often seen as key market movers because of their large holdings, now number 1,455 entities, up from a contraction in late April. This renewed growth among the largest of Bitcoin holders reflects either a new accumulation phase or consolidation among holders of the original cryptocurrency. At the very least, a higher count of Bitcoin whales signals a ramped-up interest in the storied asset among some very wealthy or institutional players. After dipping in late April, the number of #Bitcoin whales (≥1k $BTC ) has resumed its climb – reaching 1,455 entities even as the price hit a new ATH: https://t.co/O9oN7mZlLk pic.twitter.com/2zebaS6vik — glassnode (@glassnode) May 27, 2025 In the Bitcoin ecosystem, whales have a really big role. Their buy and sell decisions result in a liquidity influx or just as much in a liquidity drain, and are therefore pretty much the most direct influence on the market. The number of Bitcoin whales has been on the rise. This could signal that confidence remains strong among the biggest holders. Nonetheless, it’s critical to point out that a rise in the number of whale holders doesn’t equate to all whales stacking more Bitcoin. Reflecting developments in the whale segment, we could be seeing two things: 1. A count increase in actual whale wallets, which signals a favorable trend for the distribution of Bitcoin among major holders. 2. An increase in the number of wallets with at least 1,000 BTC, which could mean that some of the new wallets are simply picking up chunks of Bitcoin. Miners Respond to ATH with Increased Selling Activity Ever since the price of Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high, there has been a noticeable uptick in the number of miners selling their newly minted coins on exchanges. Recent data shows that daily inflows of Bitcoin from miners to exchanges have doubled—from an average of 25 BTC per day to around 50 BTC per day. This is an impressive, if not quite astonishing, acceleration, and it is one that has surely caught the eye of quite a few market observers as of late. After the ATH, miners have stepped up their sales on exchanges. Inflows have doubled from an average of 25BTC to 50BTC per day, while historical peaks reach around 100BTC. This shows that selling has indeed accelerated though we’re still a long way from peak volumes and the… pic.twitter.com/fTsGLyKovc — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) May 27, 2025 This increase in miner selling is a direct response to the market. Sometimes miners just sell to cover the basic operational costs that you would expect from any business—stuff like electricity and maintaining the actual hardware. But when the price of Bitcoin doubles, and you’re the one producing it, it becomes quite reasonable to take some profits on the way up. Even with the rising sales, the market has seemed capable of taking in this extra supply. This points to a very liquid market and a demand from buyers that seems ongoing and ready to absorb miner selling without causing much in the way of price disruption. There is a balance right now between how much miners are supplying and how much the market is able to take in. And that balance is crucial if we want to avoid having the price skyrocket in a bull run or crash under selling pressure when the network is collapsing for some reason. Miner Revenue Signals Strong Network Activity, But Room to Grow The generation of revenue for miners offers another glimpse into the health of the Bitcoin network and the dynamics of its market. At present, miners are bringing in about $50 million daily in Bitcoin rewards and, yes, fees. That number is a big one, a sign that mining is going on at a scale at which sufficient security is being delivered to the network. At present, miners are earning around $50M per day, while historical revenue peaks exceed $80M. This indicates a high but not yet peak level of network activity: miners are already generating significant income, yet there’s still room to climb back to those previous highs. pic.twitter.com/OKFof2GalA — Axel Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) May 27, 2025 Miners have surpassed historical revenue highs of $80 million per day, suggesting that not only are we at a high point now, but there’s still room to grow before hitting the levels of past peaks. It makes you wonder just how far network activity and overall profitability can go. And is there more incentive for miners to hop on board or for the price of the assets themselves to appreciate? This interplay between miner earnings and market conditions often acts as a bellwether for Bitcoin’s broader ecosystem. Higher miner revenue can incentivize increased mining capacity and network security, but it also leads to higher sell pressure as miners convert rewards into fiat or other assets. The recent trends surrounding Bitcoin whales and miner selling provide us with a somewhat complicated view of the current Bitcoin market. Selling by miners has increased because they’re now taking advantage of the higher prices. They’re clearly not holding onto their Bitcoin in any significant amounts anymore, and they don’t seem to be too worried about the upcoming halving. Whales, on the other hand, seem confident in the future of Bitcoin. They’re not selling, and in fact, some of them might even be buying. The market seems capable of absorbing significant amounts of Bitcoin without too much fuss. The current evolution of Bitcoin provides a fascinating glimpse into its dynamic future. Watching the balance between whale accumulation, miner liquidation, and demand from the wider world will be vital to understanding just what the price action and overall network health will be across the next months. In these parts, it’s generally understood that our ecosystem is vibrant. Whale numbers are up, miner revenues (while solid) aren’t through the roof, and that means we’ve still got the appearance of a maturing, healthy Bitcoin. But is it really that way, and if so, what does it mean? Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice. Always do your research before buying any cryptocurrency or investing in any services.

2025-05-28T07:36:35.000Z,"SharpLink Gaming Bets Big on Ethereum: $425M Raise Sparks Market Buzz","In a surprise move for the crypto world, SharpLink Gaming, which is listed on the Nasdaq, has pronounced an astounding initiative to amass a substantial $425 million worth of funding, all meant to buy Ethereum ($ETH). The crypto community has taken notice, and for good reason: the very day SharpLink made its announcement, its stock shot up—up, up, and away—by an utterly insane 262%. Even with recent sharp increases in value, analysts are still recommending caution when it comes to Ethereum. A huge chunk of its market cap (around $123 billion) is positioned only 0–20% above the necessary breakeven point to convert the current holders into actual profit. That’s not a lot of room for the asset to play around with under the cover of seeming healthy market sentiment. In a declining price scenario, that covers at least 10% of the holders who would be pushed into a loss—they’re not gonna like that, and it seems at this point quite likely that at least 10% of the holders are gonna cover. Covering can be done in a variety of ways. COMPANIES ARE NOW PLANNING TO BUY $ETH Just now, Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming announced a $𝟒𝟐𝟓,𝟎𝟎𝟎,𝟎𝟎𝟎 raise to buy Ethereum. SharpLink Gaming's stock price is up 𝟐𝟔𝟐% after this news I hope it becomes a success like MicroStrategy and sends ETH above… pic.twitter.com/9ryalm0Vum — Wise Advice (@wiseadvicesumit) May 27, 2025 Institutional Momentum Building for Ethereum? SharpLink has decided to buy Bitcoin, and its decision echoes that of MicroStrategy. The high-profile business of MicroStrategy made headlines in 2020 and beyond with its bold Bitcoin acquisition strategy. That campaign helped push BTC into a more mainstream financial conversation and played a key role in the asset being valued at all-time highs. Is Ethereum the next target? SharpLink’s initiative may be one of the largest public raises specifically aimed at purchasing ETH, and it could well set a precedent for more corporate treasuries to diversify into Ethereum as a long-term investment. In an environment where crypto is increasingly viewed as an inflation hedge and as a bulwark against the continued debasement of fiat currencies, the growing appeal of ETH is further enhanced by its burgeoning use case—from decentralized finance to NFTs to smart contracts. Should other publicly traded firms choose to emulate SharpLink—and there are already hints that some may—this could yield pressure on Ethereum’s price that lasts. Analysts and enthusiasts even wonder aloud whether, in this next market cycle, ETH might punch through resistance that is more psychological than real on its way to $10,000. ETH Price Gains vs. Market Fragility Even though there is now a lot of interest from institutions, Ethereum’s current standing is still weak. A recent look at the data puts most of ETH’s market cap in wallets that are just barely in the money. These wallets hold coins that are only 0-20% above acquisition prices. So, if the price were to correct even slightly—say, back toward the $2,300 price point—there would be a large number of holders who’d suddenly find themselves in the position of holding ETH with an acquisition price that’s above the current market price. The largest share of #ETH market cap – $123B – sits just 0–20% above cost basis. That cohort swelled from $2.3K to $2.5K, meaning even a modest price drop could flip a large chunk of supply into loss. Despite recent gains, $ETH remains in a fragile position. pic.twitter.com/5Ay5Jx5Qv5 — glassnode (@glassnode) May 27, 2025 The fragility poses risks, especially when sentiment is this bullish. SharpLink’s announcement has undoubtedly injected momentum into the ETH narrative but could also set unrealistic expectations. If Ethereum fails to deliver on short-term price gains, the fragility could lead to amplified disappointment among retail investors and institutions. Even so, Ethereum has taken a beating, just like many other cryptocurrencies, yet it has reasserted itself as a foundational layer for the .”decentralized web”—or what some might call the future of the internet. This is because Ethereum has scaled, allowing far more transactions to occur on its network than before, and it has upgraded from the “proof-of-work” format to the vastly more energy-efficient “proof-of-stake” format. And these changes have occurred within a broader upgrade to the rules of the Ethereum network itself. Looking Ahead: A New Chapter for Ethereum? SharpLink Gaming’s $425 million influx is a lot more than a finance play. It signals an even bolder confidence in the future of Ethereum. Whether public companies make this a trend will be shown in time, but the implications for Ethereum as a public company are significant in several ways. If nothing else, in an era where public companies are cutting back and putting their own cash on their balance sheets, this is the clearest sign yet that Ethereum retains a compelling use case. Yet, investors and watchers of this space must proceed with great caution. An asset class can shift in fundamental quality in the blink of an eye, and dramatic price moves are not uncommon. If you’re bullish on crypto, you might take this morning’s announcement from SharpLink as more bullish news in an overall cautious market, one with a lot of uncertain player and price dynamics.

Robert Mitchnick, Managing Director at BlackRock, said that Bitcoin offers “much higher upside than gold and lower downside,” strengthening the idea that Bitcoin is maturing as a mainstream investment asset. Bitcoin vs. Gold: Not a Zero-Sum Game Mitchnick made it clear that comparing Bitcoin and gold doesn’t have to be a competition. Instead, he sees both as strong assets that serve a similar purpose, helping investors hedge against traditional financial risks. Meanwhile, he described them as “different angles on a similar theme,” highlighting that both are scarce, decentralized, and not controlled by governments. JUST IN: $11.5 trillion BlackRock Managing Director said \""Bitcoin has much higher upside than gold\"" pic.twitter.com/YTA5tFJxzX — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) May 27, 2025 While gold has been trusted for centuries and is less volatile, Bitcoin stands out as a digital-native asset fit for today’s fast-paced world. It’s cheaper to store, easy to transfer globally, and works efficiently within a tech-driven financial ecosystem. Digital Advantages Give Bitcoin the Edge Mitchnick noted Bitcoin’s modern advantages. Unlike gold, Bitcoin can be moved instantly across the world with nearly zero cost. These features make it highly attractive to both retail and institutional investors looking for quick and flexible alternatives to traditional safe-haven assets. That’s why he believes Bitcoin has greater upside potential and, surprisingly, less downside risk than many think. “Many investors are adding both to their portfolios,” he said, pointing out that allocation shifts like 80% gold and 20% Bitcoin or even 50-50 are becoming more common. Bitcoin Price Outlook Looking at the bitcoin price, it has dropped by almost 3% after reaching a new record high. Right now, Bitcoin is trading at about $109,000, and its total market value is at $2.16 trillion. There’s some interesting data from CoinGlass . It shows that a short squeeze could be coming.

2025-05-28T07:34:00.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Gears Up For New Highs, Smart Money Is Accumulating These 2 XRP Rivals","The crypto market is heating up again. Major players are positioning early with Bitcoin trading just below its all-time high. However, smart money isn’t only focused on BTC. It’s rotating into assets that combine upside potential with real-world application. Two strong contenders gaining momentum are Worldcoin and Remittix , both offering fresh value compared to legacy options like XRP. Bitcoin price holds firm near record highs Source: Coinmarketcap The Bitcoin price is currently around $109,317 , which is within reach of its all-time high of $111,970.17. Traders are watching the $112,000 level for a confirmed breakout. With macro conditions improving and ETF activity rebounding, momentum could push BTC into new territory. Some analysts now expect a short-term climb toward $117,000 or even $120,000. Institutional flows continue to build. BTC is still seen as a digital reserve by hedge funds and high-net-worth portfolios. But many of those same players are now diversifying into faster-moving projects with room to run. XRP remains steady but eyes are shifting Source: Financemagnets XRP is holding support around $2.31. It’s stable, and sentiment is improving as the market anticipates further regulatory clarity. Some models project that XRP could reach $8 in 2025 . That would be a solid return, but some investors are now looking for assets with different use cases or more immediate upside. This shift is where rising projects come in, especially ones with traction in areas XRP hasn’t fully captured, like identity and fiat conversion. Worldcoin pushes higher with growing use case Worldcoin has gained significant attention over the last few weeks. The token is trading at $1.35, and some forecasts suggest a push toward $2.40 if volume continues to rise. But the appeal here is not just about price. The WLD ecosystem is built around solving one of crypto’s biggest gaps: identity. By offering a global digital identity layer, WLD aims to onboard users in underserved regions who need access to finance, not just speculation. With $135 million in recent funding and growing adoption across markets, WLD is emerging as more than just an altcoin and it’s a project with a real mission. This direction makes it a true rival to XRP, but with a newer and broader scope. Remittix keeps it simple and functional While bigger names dominate the news, Remittix is gaining quiet traction by focusing on real-world utility. It allows users to convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat and send them directly to global bank accounts. There are no middle steps, wallet confusion or hidden FX charges. For businesses, Remittix offers a plug-and-play API to accept crypto and settle in fiat, across 30 fiat currencies and 50 crypto pairs. The simplicity of the process is what’s getting early investor interest. With $15.3 million raised and the token still in presale, RTX could find a strong foothold in the cross-border payments space. Final thoughts The Bitcoin price is moving with confidence, and that’s pulling capital back into the market. While BTC and XRP remain strong, the conversation is expanding. Investors are betting on projects that solve new problems, not just scale old ones. WLD is redefining digital identity. Remittix is streamlining how crypto becomes usable money. Both are becoming serious contenders for those seeking strong XRP alternatives in this next cycle.

2025-05-28T07:30:24.000Z,"Bitcoin Treasury: Captor Capital Makes Bold Crypto Investment Move","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasury: Captor Capital Makes Bold Crypto Investment Move In a significant move highlighting the increasing embrace of digital assets by traditional firms, Canadian investment company Captor Capital has announced a strategic allocation towards Bitcoin. This decision sees the firm add Bitcoin to its corporate treasury, a trend gaining traction among forward-thinking companies seeking alternative store-of-value assets and growth opportunities in the digital economy. Why Are Companies Adding Bitcoin to Their Corporate Treasury? The decision by companies like Captor Capital to incorporate Bitcoin into their treasury reserves isn’t merely speculative; it’s often a calculated strategic play. Traditionally, corporate treasuries hold cash and short-term, low-yield investments to manage liquidity and preserve capital. However, in the current economic climate characterized by inflation concerns and low interest rates, the purchasing power of fiat currency can erode over time. Adding Bitcoin to the corporate treasury offers several potential advantages: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply (capped at 21 million coins) is often cited as a defense against inflation, unlike fiat currencies which can be printed indefinitely. Store of Value: Proponents view Bitcoin as digital gold, a scarce asset that can retain value over the long term. Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term growth potential compared to traditional assets. Diversification: Bitcoin offers diversification away from traditional financial markets and assets. Signal to Market: Holding Bitcoin can signal innovation and adaptability to investors and the market. While pioneering companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla made headlines with large Bitcoin acquisitions, the move by Captor Capital demonstrates that this strategy is being adopted by a broader range of firms, including those in diverse sectors like investment and potentially cannabis (given Captor Capital’s known interests). Captor Capital’s Specific Crypto Investment: What Happened? According to a press release distributed via GlobeNewswire, Captor Capital announced it had acquired $500,000 worth of Bitcoin (BTC) for its treasury. This specific crypto investment represents a deliberate decision to allocate a portion of the company’s capital into the leading digital asset. Accompanying this acquisition, the firm also disclosed the issuance of $450,000 in unsecured convertible loan notes. These notes were issued to a European institutional investor. Convertible notes are a type of debt that can be converted into equity (shares) under certain conditions. Using such instruments can provide capital for acquisitions or operations while offering the investor potential upside linked to the company’s future performance, or in this context, potentially linked to future equity or other arrangements. This structure suggests a carefully planned financial manoeuvre, linking the strategic asset acquisition (Bitcoin) with a specific funding mechanism involving an institutional player. Understanding Institutional Adoption in Crypto The involvement of a European institutional investor in financing Captor Capital’s move is just as significant as the Bitcoin purchase itself. Institutional adoption refers to the increasing participation of large financial institutions, corporations, and investment funds in the cryptocurrency market. Their involvement is crucial because: It brings substantial capital into the market. It lends credibility and legitimacy to the asset class. It often leads to the development of regulated products and infrastructure (like futures, options, and custody solutions) that make crypto more accessible and palatable for other large players. Captor Capital, as an investment firm itself, making a direct treasury allocation and simultaneously engaging with an institutional investor for financing, exemplifies this trend. It shows growing confidence not just in Bitcoin as an asset, but also in the evolving financial structures around it that facilitate larger transactions and corporate involvement. Benefits and Challenges of a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy While the potential benefits discussed earlier are attractive, holding Bitcoin in a corporate treasury is not without its challenges. Potential Benefits: Potential appreciation significantly boosting treasury value. Protection against long-term fiat devaluation. Enhanced appeal to investors interested in digital assets. Setting a precedent or leadership position in their sector regarding digital asset integration. Potential Challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically, potentially leading to significant paper losses in the treasury value. Accounting Treatment: Accounting rules for digital assets can be complex and vary by jurisdiction (often treated as intangible assets subject to impairment). Security Risks: Securely storing private keys requires robust security protocols to prevent theft or loss. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving and varies globally. Public Perception: Some stakeholders might view Bitcoin investment as risky or outside the company’s core business. Companies undertaking this strategy must carefully weigh these factors and implement strong risk management protocols. Actionable Insights from Captor Capital’s Move For investors and businesses watching the space, Captor Capital’s action provides several insights: Institutional Interest is Real: The involvement of a European institutional investor in the financing underscores that large financial players are actively participating, not just watching. Treasury Strategy is Evolving: Companies are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a legitimate component for long-term treasury management, not just a speculative trading asset. Size Matters, But Trend is Key: While $500,000 might seem modest compared to billion-dollar corporate holdings, it signals intent and a shift in capital allocation strategy for a firm like Captor Capital. It adds to the growing number of companies engaging with the asset class. Financing Mechanisms are Developing: The use of convertible notes shows how traditional financial instruments are being adapted to facilitate crypto-related corporate activities. Monitoring such moves across different sectors and geographies provides valuable insight into the pace and nature of broader institutional adoption . Conclusion: A Step Towards Mainstream Acceptance Captor Capital’s decision to add Bitcoin to treasury reserves, supported by institutional financing, is more than just a news item; it’s another brick in the wall of institutional adoption for cryptocurrencies. While challenges remain, the increasing willingness of publicly traded companies and investment firms to hold Bitcoin as a strategic asset for their corporate treasury signifies a maturing market and growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. This crypto investment move by a Canadian firm, backed by European capital, illustrates the global nature of this evolving financial trend.

2025-05-28T07:20:49.000Z,"Bitcoin Rally Surges 47%, Yet Long-Term Holders Show Unwavering Conviction","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Rally Surges 47%, Yet Long-Term Holders Show Unwavering Conviction The cryptocurrency world is buzzing! Bitcoin (BTC) has once again captured headlines, staging an impressive rally that saw its price climb more than 47% from recent lows, even hitting brand new record highs. This kind of price action usually brings out the sellers, especially those who bought Bitcoin a long time ago and are sitting on massive profits. But here’s the surprising twist: the most dedicated participants – the long-term holders – appear to be showing remarkable restraint. Understanding the Bitcoin Rally and Long-Term Holder Behavior When we talk about a Bitcoin rally of this magnitude, it’s natural to assume significant profit-taking is occurring. After all, many individuals and institutions who held Bitcoin through previous cycles are now seeing their investments reach unprecedented values. However, analyzing the behavior of these experienced market participants requires looking beyond just the price chart. This is where on-chain metrics become invaluable tools for understanding the underlying market dynamics. Jamie Coutts, Chief Crypto Analyst at Real Vision, highlighted this exact phenomenon. He noted that while certain high-level metrics might suggest the potential for profit-taking, others reveal whether that potential is actually being realized by those with the deepest conviction. On-Chain Metrics: Potential vs. Realization To get a clearer picture of what’s happening under the hood of the Bitcoin price movement, analysts use various on-chain indicators. Two commonly cited metrics are the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio and the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL). These metrics essentially compare the current market price to the average purchase price of all Bitcoins on the network, giving an idea of the overall profitability of the market. MVRV Ratio: This compares Bitcoin’s market cap to its realized cap (which values each Bitcoin at the price it last moved). A high MVRV suggests the market is overheated and many holders are in profit, potentially signaling a top. NUPL: This metric shows the aggregate profit or loss of all Bitcoin positions. A high NUPL indicates a large percentage of the market is in unrealized profit. Both MVRV and NUPL have indeed reflected the significant potential for profit-taking during this recent Bitcoin rally . With the price soaring, a vast number of coins are now held at a substantial unrealized gain. However, these metrics tell us about potential profit, not realized profit. The Key Metric: LTH-SOPR Reveals Long-Term Holder Actions To understand if long-term holders are actually selling and taking those profits, analysts turn to metrics like the Long-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (LTH-SOPR). This metric specifically looks at the average profit/loss of coins that have moved on-chain and were held for a significant period (usually defined as longer than 155 days). An LTH-SOPR value above 1 indicates that long-term holders are selling coins at a profit, while a value below 1 suggests they are selling at a loss (a rare event in a strong bull market). The higher the LTH-SOPR value, the larger the average profit being taken by these holders when they decide to spend their coins. Jamie Coutts pointed to the LTH-SOPR as the crucial indicator revealing the true behavior of long-term holders during this rally. He provided historical context for LTH-SOPR values at previous market peaks: 2017 Peak: LTH-SOPR reached approximately 17. This signifies massive profits being realized by long-term holders exiting positions. 2021 Peak: LTH-SOPR peaked around 8. Still very high, indicating significant profit-taking, but less extreme than 2017. Q1 2024 Peak (at the time of hitting new highs): LTH-SOPR reached about 4.3. This was the highest it had been in the current cycle, indicating some distribution, but notably lower than previous cycle tops. Now, despite the Bitcoin price hitting new records and the rally continuing, the LTH-SOPR sits at just 2.1. This is significantly lower than the values seen at the peak of the 2017 and 2021 bull runs, and even below the recent Q1 2024 high. This data strongly suggests that, while there’s immense potential for profit-taking, long-term holders have yet to engage in widespread selling. Why Are Long-Term Holders Holding Firm? This observation raises a fascinating question: why aren’t these experienced holders capitalizing more aggressively on the current Bitcoin rally ? Several factors could be at play: Belief in Higher Prices: Many long-term holders have weathered multiple market cycles and may genuinely believe that Bitcoin’s price is headed significantly higher in this cycle, perhaps targeting values far exceeding current levels. Anticipation of Further Demand: The approval and success of spot Bitcoin ETFs in major markets have opened new avenues for institutional and retail investment. Holders may be anticipating continued inflows that will push the price up further. HODLing Culture: The strong ‘HODL’ (Hold On for Dear Life) ethos within the Bitcoin community is a powerful psychological factor. For many, Bitcoin is not just a short-term trade but a long-term store of value or even a form of digital property they intend to hold for years, if not decades. Tax Implications: Selling assets held for over a year often qualifies for more favorable long-term capital gains tax rates. However, realizing massive profits still incurs a tax liability, which might deter some holders from selling until absolutely necessary or until they perceive a cycle top is imminent. Comparison to Previous Cycles: As the LTH-SOPR data shows, previous tops saw much higher profit realization levels. Holders might be waiting for the market exuberance and on-chain metrics to reach levels more comparable to past peaks before considering significant distribution. Implications for Crypto Market Analysis What does this behavior of long-term holders mean for the broader crypto market analysis ? The fact that this cohort, often considered the ‘smart money’ or the most convicted holders, is not selling aggressively during a major price surge suggests a few things: Strong Underlying Conviction: It indicates a high level of confidence among experienced investors regarding Bitcoin’s future prospects. Potential for Further Upside: If the most patient sellers aren’t selling yet, it implies that the selling pressure primarily comes from shorter-term traders or newer market entrants. The absence of significant long-term holder distribution could mean there’s still room for the rally to continue before a major top is formed. Market Structure Difference: This cycle might be fundamentally different due to factors like institutional adoption via ETFs, potentially changing the typical patterns of supply and demand compared to previous cycles. However, it’s crucial to remember that market dynamics can change rapidly. While current on-chain metrics suggest limited long-term holder selling, this could shift if the Bitcoin price sees a sharp correction or if external factors create uncertainty. Monitoring LTH-SOPR and other on-chain data will be key to identifying potential changes in this behavior. Challenges and What to Watch For While the current LTH-SOPR reading is bullish from a supply perspective, challenges remain. The potential for profit-taking still exists, and a sudden market shock or a perceived cycle peak could trigger selling from even the most steadfast holders. Key things to watch include: A significant and rapid increase in LTH-SOPR towards levels seen in previous cycles (8, 17, or even higher). Increased inflows of Bitcoin to exchanges, particularly from wallets identified as long-term holders. Changes in other on-chain metrics that signal distribution or weakening demand. Actionable Insights from On-Chain Metrics For those navigating the current market, the insights from on-chain metrics and the behavior of long-term holders offer valuable perspective: Don’t just look at the price: Understand the underlying supply and demand dynamics by exploring on-chain data. Pay attention to LTH-SOPR: This specific metric provides a window into the actions of the most experienced market participants. Consider the long-term view: The conviction of long-term holders suggests that many see significant future value in Bitcoin, reinforcing the idea of a multi-year investment horizon rather than short-term trading. Stay informed: Keep track of key on-chain indicators and expert analysis to understand shifts in market sentiment and holder behavior. Conclusion: Unwavering Conviction Amidst the Rally Bitcoin’s remarkable 47%+ Bitcoin rally has pushed its price to new heights, creating immense unrealized profits for many holders. Yet, as revealed by crucial on-chain metrics like LTH-SOPR, the most patient and experienced investors – the long-term holders – are largely holding firm. Their current profit-taking levels are significantly lower than those observed at the peak of previous bull markets, suggesting a strong, unwavering conviction in Bitcoin’s future potential. This behavior provides valuable insight for anyone performing crypto market analysis , potentially signaling that this market cycle still has unique dynamics at play and that significant supply from the most steadfast hands has yet to hit the market.

While the landscape for Dogecoin appears promising, concerns surround Shiba Inu and its next move. At first, Ali Martinez noted that the TD Sequential metric, which is used to determine the underlying asset’s trend exhaustion in either direction, has flashed a buy signal for DOGE on the hourly chart. Previous examples show that the OG meme coin is particularly susceptible to this metric. Recall that it pointed to another buy signal in late February when its price had tumbled below $0.195. Within the next few days or so, it skyrocketed to over $0.24. #Dogecoin $DOGE prepares to rebound as the TD Sequential flashes a buy signal on the hourly chart! pic.twitter.com/RRNTDasYZd — Ali (@ali_charts) May 28, 2025 DOGE peaked at $0.26 on May 11 as the entire market rebounded from the Trump-induced uncertainty, but has failed to recapture its momentum and was stopped at $0.255 last week after Bitcoin’s latest all-time high . It has lost 13% of value since then and trades at just over $0.222 now, but the TD Sequential could hint at more upcoming gains. SHIB’s monthly chart is quite similar to that of its bigger competitor, as it shot up to over $0.000016 in mid-May but has fallen by around 12-13% since then. Martinez noted its recent behavior, which has been consolidating in a descending triangle, potentially leading to a significant 17% move. Although Martinez didn’t provide a clear direction, the descending triangle is a bearish chart pattern indicating weakening demand, which typically leads to a price correction. #ShibaInu $SHIB consolidates within a triangle, awaiting a 17% price move! pic.twitter.com/jdjMzVxtme — Ali (@ali_charts) May 28, 2025 Despite this relatively worrying price structure for SHIB, many industry experts continue to be bullish on the asset.

2025-05-28T07:18:22.000Z,"Meme Coins Are Central to Crypto Adoption, Gemini Report Finds","Over 90% of all crypto owners hold some kind of memecoin, a new Gemini report finds. Perhaps that’s not too unusual, degens being what they are. But in France, 19% of crypto investors who held both traditional crypto and meme coins reported buying memes first. In the UK, that percentage rose to 28%. In Australia, it was 30%. And it wasn’t just that more people bought memes; more people bought crypto in general. Here’s what the survey found. Global Crypto Ownership Increased Nearly a quarter of all surveyed UK residents said they own crypto. In the US, the number was only slightly lower at 22%. In the four countries surveyed in both 2024 and 2025, ownership increased across the board. More and more people are buying crypto, indicating growing adoption and cultural acceptance. That’s helped by favorable government policies – especially in the US. Per the report: Nearly a quarter (23%) of non-crypto owners in the US said the launch of Strategic Bitcoin Reserve makes them more confident in the value of cryptocurrency. — Gemini Report, 2025 Global State of Crypto As goes the US, so goes the world; the US reserve strategy – influenced heavily by Michael Saylor and Strategy – has had an impact globally. That’s right – for all his bluster, Trump is at least partially correct; he is the Crypto President after all, and he’s boosting crypto in the US and beyond. And his move to launch his own memecoin – $TRUMP – might have been particularly savvy, as investors are increasingly starting their crypto adventures with memes. Dogecoin Before Bitcoin? In the US, 31% of crypto and meme coin holders claimed they started with meme coins. It might seem outlandish, but the findings point to meme coins being a sort of onramp or gateway to the broader crypto economy. Take France, where 67% of crypto investors hold memecoins. Investors are starting with meme coins and then expanding into traditional cryptos like $BTC and $ETH. But importantly, many never abandon memecoins; they hold both as part of their portfolios. That means that despite their inherent ‘faddish-ness,’ memecoins play a crucial role in the crypto economy. They onramp new investors, and then serve to diversify the portfolio of more seasoned hands. If you’re looking for a good entry point, here are 3 of the best meme coins to buy in 2025. 1.

Monero Futures Open Interest Surges as Price Falls By Nearly $100 in 3 Days","Privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero (XMR) has seen a sharp price sell-off over the past three days, with open positions in futures rising to their highest level since December. On Wednesday, the largest privacy coin by market capitalization fell to $325 on Kraken, having peaked at $420 on Monday, according to data source TradingView. The sell-off follows a meteoric seven-week rise from $165 to $420, supposedly led by a favorable U.S. regulatory outlook and impending FCMP++ upgrade, which will enhance Monero's quantum resistance by providing forward secrecy.

The OI has increased by 20% over the past three days. An increase in open interest alongside a price drop is typically interpreted as representing a bearish sentiment, with more traders taking short positions in anticipation of a price decline. Funding rates hold positive That's not necessarily the case with XMR, as the perpetual funding rates continue to be positive, indicating a bias for long positions. Funding rates, charged every eight hours, represent the cost of holding levered futures bets, with positive values representing a dominance of bullish long bets.

2025-05-28T07:10:44.000Z,"Metaplanet Bitcoin: Japan’s Bold $50M Bond Move Fuels Massive BTC Purchase","BitcoinWorld Metaplanet Bitcoin: Japan’s Bold $50M Bond Move Fuels Massive BTC Purchase Hey crypto enthusiasts and finance watchers! Big news is coming out of Japan that’s set to make waves in the world of corporate treasury management and, of course, Bitcoin. Metaplanet, a Japanese company already known for its significant Bitcoin holdings, has just announced a strategic move that underscores its strong conviction in the digital asset. This development puts the spotlight squarely back on Metaplanet Bitcoin strategy and the growing trend of Corporate Bitcoin adoption globally, particularly in the Japanese market. What Exactly Did Metaplanet Announce Regarding Metaplanet Bitcoin? Metaplanet shared via their official communication channels that they plan to issue 6.4 billion Japanese Yen (JPY) worth of 0% Ordinary Bonds. At current exchange rates, this amounts to approximately $50 million USD. The stated purpose of issuing these bonds is crystal clear: to acquire additional Bitcoin (BTC). This isn’t Metaplanet’s first foray into using debt to fund Bitcoin investment . They have previously utilized similar financial instruments to increase their BTC stack. This repeated strategy signals a deliberate and consistent approach to leveraging their balance sheet to gain more exposure to the leading cryptocurrency. Issuing 0% bonds is particularly interesting in the current economic climate. It means Metaplanet is essentially borrowing money without incurring interest costs for the duration of the bond term. This low-cost financing method allows them to acquire an appreciating asset like Bitcoin without the drag of interest payments, assuming the Bitcoin price performs favorably over time. It’s a financial maneuver aimed at optimizing their capital structure for their specific Bitcoin investment goals. Why Are Companies Pursuing Corporate Bitcoin Adoption? The decision by a publicly listed company like Metaplanet to issue debt specifically for a BTC purchase highlights a broader shift in corporate finance thinking. Why are more companies considering or actively engaging in Corporate Bitcoin adoption ? Several factors drive this trend: Inflation Hedge: In an era of potential currency debasement and rising inflation concerns, companies are looking for assets that can potentially preserve or increase purchasing power over the long term. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply and decentralized nature, is viewed by some as a digital store of value, analogous to digital gold. Store of Value: Beyond inflation, companies hold significant cash reserves. Keeping large amounts of cash can lead to value erosion, especially in low-interest-rate environments or periods of economic uncertainty. Allocating a portion to Bitcoin is seen as a way to hold a non-sovereign, censorship-resistant asset. Balance Sheet Optimization: For companies like Metaplanet, using low-cost debt (like 0% bonds) to acquire Bitcoin is a way to potentially enhance shareholder value. If the return on the Bitcoin investment exceeds the cost of borrowing (in this case, zero), it can be accretive to the company’s financial position. Industry Leadership and Signaling: Being an early mover in holding Bitcoin can attract investor attention, particularly from those interested in the crypto space. It signals a forward-thinking approach to treasury management and a belief in the future of digital assets. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury diversifies holdings away from traditional fiat currencies and financial instruments, reducing concentration risk. Metaplanet and the Japan Bitcoin Scene Metaplanet’s aggressive move is particularly significant within the context of Japan Bitcoin adoption. While Japan is a major economic power and has a relatively mature regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies compared to some nations, widespread corporate adoption of Bitcoin as a treasury asset hasn’t been as prominent as in some Western countries, notably the US. Metaplanet is positioning itself as a leader in the Japan Bitcoin space for corporate treasury. Their repeated actions could potentially serve as a case study and encourage other Japanese firms to explore similar strategies. This $50 million bond issuance for a BTC purchase is one of the most significant corporate crypto-related financial maneuvers seen from a Japanese listed company to date, solidifying Metaplanet’s role as a key player in driving Corporate Bitcoin adoption in the region. Their public announcements on platforms like X not only inform investors but also serve as a form of advocacy for Bitcoin within the Japanese business community. Understanding the BTC Purchase Strategy: Bonds for Bitcoin Let’s break down the mechanism Metaplanet is using for this specific Bitcoin investment . They are issuing bonds, which is essentially taking on debt. This debt is then used to fund the purchase of Bitcoin. Here’s a simplified view: Metaplanet issues bonds to investors. Investors give Metaplanet cash. Metaplanet uses the cash raised from the bond issuance to buy Bitcoin on the open market. Over time, Metaplanet holds the Bitcoin, hoping its value increases. At the bond’s maturity date, Metaplanet must repay the principal amount to the bondholders (in this case, the original 6.4 billion JPY). The key advantage of 0% bonds is the lack of interest payments, which reduces the cost of the strategy. However, the primary risk remains the volatility of Bitcoin. If the price of Bitcoin falls significantly by the time the bonds mature, Metaplanet might have difficulty repaying the bondholders using the value of their BTC holdings, potentially requiring them to raise funds through other means or sell assets at a loss. This strategy is distinct from using cash reserves (which doesn’t incur debt but reduces liquidity) or issuing equity (which dilutes existing shareholders). Using debt amplifies potential gains (if BTC rises) but also amplifies potential losses (if BTC falls). Benefits and Challenges of this Bitcoin Investment Metaplanet’s latest move highlights several potential benefits and inherent challenges associated with using debt for a significant Bitcoin investment : Potential Benefits: Leveraged Upside: Using borrowed funds can magnify returns if the price of Bitcoin appreciates significantly. Low-Cost Financing: 0% bonds provide capital without the burden of interest payments, making the cost of acquiring Bitcoin very low. Capital Efficiency: Allows the company to acquire a substantial amount of Bitcoin without depleting existing cash reserves needed for operations. Attracting Crypto-Focused Investors: Reinforces their position as a ‘Bitcoin company,’ potentially attracting investors specifically interested in crypto exposure through a traditional stock. Inflation Hedge: Provides a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currency held on the balance sheet. Inherent Challenges: Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile. A significant downturn could make it difficult to repay the debt upon maturity. Repayment Risk: The principal amount must be repaid regardless of Bitcoin’s performance. If BTC value is insufficient, the company faces liquidity challenges. Regulatory Uncertainty: While Japan has regulations, the global crypto regulatory landscape is still evolving, posing potential risks. Public Perception: Some traditional investors may view this strategy as overly risky or speculative, potentially impacting stock valuation. How Does Metaplanet Compare to Other Corporate Bitcoin Holders? When discussing Corporate Bitcoin adoption , it’s impossible not to mention MicroStrategy, the US-based software company that pioneered the strategy of holding significant Bitcoin on its balance sheet, often funded through debt and equity offerings. Metaplanet is often referred to as “Japan’s MicroStrategy” due to its similar strategy. Here’s a quick comparison (figures are approximate and subject to change): Company Location Primary Business Estimated BTC Holdings Funding Strategy MicroStrategy USA Business Intelligence Software ~214,400 BTC Debt, Equity, Cash Flow Metaplanet Japan Financial Services, Real Estate ~141.07 BTC (before this purchase) Debt (0% Bonds), Cash Flow While Metaplanet’s holdings are significantly smaller than MicroStrategy’s behemoth stack, its strategy of consistently using low-cost debt specifically for BTC purchase is strikingly similar and demonstrates a high level of commitment relative to its size. This latest $50 million move will substantially increase Metaplanet’s total Metaplanet Bitcoin holdings, further solidifying its position among publicly traded companies with Bitcoin on their balance sheet. What Does This Mean for the Future of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption? Metaplanet’s continued commitment, especially using a substantial bond issuance for a BTC purchase , sends a strong signal. It suggests that despite market volatility, some companies see Bitcoin as a legitimate, long-term treasury asset. This move could: Encourage Peers: Other Japanese companies might observe Metaplanet’s strategy and consider similar approaches, potentially accelerating Japan Bitcoin adoption at the corporate level. Validate the Strategy: Each successful instance of a company executing this strategy adds credibility to the idea of holding Bitcoin on a corporate balance sheet. Increase Demand: More companies buying Bitcoin for treasury purposes adds consistent buying pressure to the market. Influence Investors: As more companies adopt Bitcoin, traditional investors may become more comfortable with the asset class. The trend of Corporate Bitcoin adoption is still relatively nascent but is gaining momentum, driven by companies like MicroStrategy and now, notably, Metaplanet in Japan. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors, Metaplanet’s announcement offers several points to consider: Watch Metaplanet’s Stock: The company’s stock price may react to this news and its future Bitcoin investment performance. Investors interested in gaining exposure to Bitcoin through a publicly traded company, particularly in Asia, might look at Metaplanet. Monitor Bitcoin Price: While $50 million is not a massive sum in the context of Bitcoin’s total market cap, it represents consistent institutional demand. Keep an eye on how corporate buys influence market dynamics. Research the Strategy: Understand the risks and rewards of a company using debt to buy volatile assets. This strategy isn’t without potential downsides. Look for Ripple Effects: Observe if other Japanese or Asian companies follow Metaplanet’s lead into Corporate Bitcoin adoption . Metaplanet’s decision reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is transitioning from a purely speculative asset to a recognized treasury reserve asset for a growing number of forward-thinking corporations. Conclusion Metaplanet’s announcement to issue $50 million in 0% bonds specifically for a BTC purchase is a significant development. It not only reinforces the company’s deep commitment to its Metaplanet Bitcoin strategy but also serves as a powerful signal for Japan Bitcoin adoption within the corporate sector. By leveraging low-cost debt for this substantial Bitcoin investment , Metaplanet is doubling down on its belief in Bitcoin as a long-term store of value and a potential enhancer of shareholder value. This move positions Metaplanet as a frontrunner in Corporate Bitcoin adoption in Asia and adds another chapter to the ongoing story of how companies are integrating digital assets into their financial strategies. As the landscape evolves, actions like these from publicly traded firms underscore the increasing mainstream acceptance and strategic importance of Bitcoin in the global economy.

I noticed that BTC just set a new all time high and that was great to see,” he said. Bitcoin recently broke through the $111K level and set a new record. It has held steady at $109K today, with rising institutional interest and ETF inflows. Traders are also betting on new highs in the coming months. Bitcoin – The Financial System of Future “Bitcoin, crypto, this is the financial system of the future. And we want this innovation to happen in the United States. We don’t want it driven offshore,” he said. “The president definitely got us off on the right foot and he wants to unleash oil and gas production in the US.” Sacks also said that both artificial intelligence (AI) and Bitcoin mining require a lot of electricity to work. He stressed that the U.S. needs to boost energy production big time to keep leading in both tech fields. Can The Government Purchase More BTC? In an interesting revelation, Sacks said that the government could purchase more Bitcoin if the Commerce or Treasury Department can find a way to fund it without increasing the debt. Thousands of Bitcoin fans flooded Las Vegas this week for BTC Inc.’s annual conference. The event featured big names and there was a “5x” increase in participation on behalf of institutional investors from a year prior. More countries are adopting Bitcoin, including Pakistan yesterday. Now, nine nations mine Bitcoin with government support.

Announced by Starknet on a May 27 post on X, Asset Runes seeks to expose Bitcoin ( BTC ) users to stablecoins, Ethereum-based assets, and real-world assets while maintaining all of the features that are unique to Bitcoin. Because each Asset Rune is backed by full reserves, users can redeem them 1:1. USD Coin ( USDC ) is currently the first supported asset, and Starknet ( STRK ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and Tether ( USDT ) will be added shortly. https://twitter.com/starknet/status/1927439802175037460?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw The system uses a trust-minimized Bitcoin–Starknet bridge and is secured by contributors like Xverse and UTXO Management. By facilitating two-way communication between Bitcoin and Starknet, this bridge removes the need for centralized middlemen and gives Bitcoin owners access to Ethereum-like features such as trading and decentralized finance. You might also like: Starknet makes history as first L2 to introduce staking on mainnet This launch is an important step in improving the functionality and adaptability of Bitcoin.

Pseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 864,500 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin looks bullish amid sustained demand from corporations and exchange-traded fund (ETF) investors. According to the trader, the steady inflows suggest that a drop below $100,000 would represent the bleakest scenario for BTC at this stage. “I’d only be concerned for BTC if we lost [$104,000] and started to close under the previous all-time high closes and range highs. Absolute worst case in my opinion would be mid $90,000s. For now, we are trading above. So, bias should be continuation.

According to Pentoshi, Bitcoin is on track to break out against gold, ultimately leaving the precious metal far behind. “At some point, BTC is going to make new highs vs Gold and never look back. The fastest growing ETF in history tells you everything you need to know, as well as the companies getting exposure.” Source: Pentoshi/X Turning to the layer-1 protocol Solana, the analyst thinks SOL will head above $200 if it manages to convert the $180 resistance into support. “SOL hit $187 today.

2025-05-28T07:00:50.000Z,"US Set To Reign As ‘Bitcoin Superpower,’ Declares Trump’s Digital Assets Chief","At the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, a session titled “Making America the Global Bitcoin Superpower” conveyed a clear message: the United States is committed to embracing Bitcoin (BTC) and leading the global market. Key speakers Bo Hines, the White House Executive Director for digital assets, and Tyler Williams from the US Treasury Department, alongside moderator Miles Jennings, outlined the government’s aggressive strategy to establish the nation as a leader in the cryptocurrency space. Integration Of Crypto With ‘Legacy Financial Systems’ “We are well on our way to becoming the Bitcoin superpower of the world,” Hines declared, emphasizing that this initiative transcends partisan politics. He described the movement as a “revolution in our financial system” that requires immediate action. Jennings pointed out the critical regulatory measures that are currently being developed. “If the bill becomes law, we will play a significant role in integrating Bitcoin, stablecoins, and other digital assets with the legacy financial system,” he stated. This integration, he noted, would be facilitated by pending stablecoin legislation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retraces Below $109,000: Analysts Split on Future Outlook Hines highlighted the importance of modernizing payment systems, asserting, “Updating the payment rails is necessary, and we are making significant progress.” He noted that forthcoming market structure legislation would clarify the regulatory landscape for intermediaries such as exchanges and brokers, determining whether digital assets will be classified as securities or commodities. Encouraging innovation within the crypto sector, Hines remarked, “We want folks to innovate here. We can’t let fear of regulatory repercussions stifle creativity.” He urged innovators who have moved abroad to consider returning, stating, “Our message to those who have gone offshore is: welcome home.” ‘Bitcoin Is The Golden Standard’ Williams reinforced the need for any new regulations to accommodate the unique nature of decentralized finance (DeFi). “Traditional financial markets operate on a principal-agent model, but crypto is shifting us toward a principal-to-principal structure,” he explained. He noted that regulatory support for the exchange-traded products (ETP) marketplace had led to a surge in institutional Bitcoin adoption, and he believes that similar outcomes could arise from stablecoin and market structure legislation. Related Reading: Dogecoin Enters Danger Zone — Chartist Predicts Sharp Drop Ahead Hines made a particularly bullish statement, declaring, “Bitcoin is truly the golden standard.

2025-05-28T07:00:34.000Z,"Early Signs of Retail Interest in Bitcoin (BTC), But No Breakout Yet","As Bitcoin trades near its recently established ATH, a crucial factor is missing from the surge: widespread retail activity. But the latest data points to early signs of movement. Such a comeback could push the world’s largest cryptocurrency to secure more gains. Early Signs of Retail Interest CryptoQuant’s analysis highlighted a notable disconnect in the current Bitcoin rally. As BTC hit new all-time highs in Q2 2025, retail investor activity remained subdued. Data tracking Bitcoin transfers in the $0-$10,000 range, a common proxy for retail demand, shows a marginal increase despite rising prices. The 30-day percentage change in retail volume remains mostly flat, suggesting that large investors and institutions are primarily fueling the rally at this stage. Historical patterns from previous bull markets, such as in 2020-2021, indicate that while institutional momentum often initiates the uptrend, sustained and accelerated growth typically requires strong retail participation. Without a significant increase in retail demand, the current price surge may lack long-term stability. However, CryptoQuant observed early signs of retail interest. While these have yet to develop into a meaningful breakout, the key takeaway is that for Bitcoin’s price to continue its upward trajectory sustainably, a clear boost in retail investor engagement is essential. Should retail volume pick up in the coming weeks, the new all-time highs may mark just the beginning of a broader rally. Institutional demand, on the other hand, remained firm as evidenced by spot Bitcoin ETFs recording $385 million in net inflows on May 27, thereby extending their streak of daily net inflows to nine consecutive sessions. Drivers of Bitcoin’s Next Bull Run If the retail fails to make a comeback, CryptoQuant’s Julio Moreno expects the next crypto “mania” may be driven not by retail investors but by smaller firms and funds following Michael Saylor’s BTC accumulation model. However, it is important for these entities to be ready to endure the cryptocurrency’s notorious volatility, especially during sharp market downturns. Increasingly, non-crypto companies are adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Japan’s Metaplanet, with 7,800 BTC, is leading the trend, alongside Hong Kong-based Boyaa Interactive with 2,410 BTC in Asia, while US-based Semler Scientific currently holds 3,808 BTC. All these firms are aiming to replicate the high-profile success of Saylor’s strategy and integrate Bitcoin into their long-term financial positioning.

Sự đổ bộ mạnh mẽ của dòng tiền từ các quỹ ETF, sự tham gia sôi động của thị trường giao ngay và sự tăng trưởng tích cực trong vốn hóa thực hiện ròng đã tạo nên làn sóng mua bền vững thay vì chỉ đơn thuần là cơn sốt đầu cơ. Dù tâm lý e ngại rủi ro vĩ mô đang quay trở lại – đặc biệt với tin tức Mỹ có thể áp thuế nhập khẩu lên tới 50% đối với hàng hóa châu Âu – Bitcoin vẫn đứng vững như một chiến binh thép, hấp thụ đợt chốt lời và giải phóng đòn bẩy dư thừa mà không hề sụp đổ nghiêm trọng. Tuy nhiên, với mức tăng mạnh như vậy, khả năng xuất hiện đợt chốt lời lớn ở vùng giá hiện tại đang ngày càng rõ ràng. Khả năng phục hồi ngoạn mục này đang thu hút sự chú ý đến vai trò ngày càng tiến hóa của Bitcoin – một tài sản nhạy cảm với biến động kinh tế vĩ mô, được thúc đẩy bởi niềm tin chứ không còn phụ thuộc vào cảm xúc ngắn hạn của nhà đầu tư nhỏ lẻ. Đáng chú ý, việc Metaplanet tích lũy 104 triệu đô la Bitcoin và đề xuất lập pháp thân thiện với crypto tại Michigan đã củng cố câu chuyện về sự hỗ trợ ngày càng lớn từ các tổ chức và chính sách cấp cao dành cho tài sản kỹ thuật số. Khả năng Bitcoin tiếp tục duy trì trên mức chi phí cơ sở của những nhà nắm giữ ngắn hạn – khoảng $95,000 – sẽ là yếu tố then chốt quyết định xu hướng sắp tới. Với hơn 11,4 tỷ đô la lợi nhuận ngắn hạn đã được thực hiện trong tháng qua, nguồn cung dư thừa ngắn hạn chắc chắn sẽ xuất hiện – nhưng cầu cấu trúc cũng sẽ không kém phần mạnh mẽ. Sức mạnh của dòng tiền ETF, độ biến động thấp và mức phí premium trên thị trường giao ngay đều gợi ý rằng thị trường đang dần trưởng thành, sẵn sàng cho một đợt bứt phá mới khi tình hình vĩ mô trở nên rõ ràng hơn. Những tuần tới có thể sẽ trả lời câu hỏi: Liệu đợt breakout vừa rồi của Bitcoin là đỉnh cục bộ hay chỉ là khúc dạo đầu cho một đợt tăng mạnh hơn vào Quý 3? Trong khi đó, bức tranh kinh tế Mỹ đang trở nên u ám hơn bao giờ hết. Lợi suất trái phiếu dài hạn tăng vọt, đồng đô la suy yếu giữa bối cảnh xếp hạng tín dụng giảm, nợ công leo thang và nguy cơ áp thuế khiến niềm tin nhà đầu tư lung lay dữ dội. Lợi suất trái phiếu kỳ hạn 10 năm và 30 năm lần lượt vượt ngưỡng 4,5% và 5% , phản ánh sự hoài nghi về kỷ luật tài khóa và nguy cơ lạm phát leo thang. Đường cong lợi suất 30Y/10Y – vốn thường được coi là tín hiệu tăng trưởng – giờ đây lại phơi bày nỗi lo sợ về rủi ro dài hạn thay vì niềm lạc quan. Với nhu cầu nước ngoài suy giảm và sự hỗ trợ từ Fed đối với thị trường trái phiếu dần phai nhạt, các thị trường đang định giá một kỷ nguyên mới với lãi suất cao hơn và biến động nhiều hơn . Thị trường trái phiếu không còn phản ứng theo từng dòng tin tức nữa – nó đang gửi đi một thông điệp mạnh mẽ: Cách chúng ta định giá rủi ro đang thay đổi cơ bản. Tuần vừa rồi, cả sự chấp nhận từ các tổ chức lẫn động lực quy định đều đạt được những bước tiến đáng kể. Các công ty niêm yết Strategy, Metaplanet và Semler Scientific đã cùng nhau tích lũy hơn 8,800 BTC , củng cố vị thế của Bitcoin như một tài sản chiến lược trong kho bạc doanh nghiệp. Đáng chú ý, Strategy hiện nắm giữ hơn 2,7% tổng cung Bitcoin, minh chứng cho xu hướng ngày càng nhiều tập đoàn coi BTC là dự trữ dài hạn trong thời kỳ bất ổn kinh tế. Về phía ứng dụng, FIFA đã gây chú ý khi thông báo xây dựng blockchain riêng trên nền tảng Avalanche, chấm dứt mối quan hệ với các đối tác cũ như Algorand và Polygon. Mạng lưới mới tương thích với EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) sẽ giúp các nhà phát triển và người hâm mộ dễ dàng tiếp cận các bộ sưu tập kỹ thuật số hơn, mở đường cho FIFA mở rộng tham vọng Web3 của mình.

2025-05-28T06:50:24.000Z,"MicroStrategy Stock Performance: Unstoppable MSTR Outpaces All 74 Crypto ETFs YTD","BitcoinWorld MicroStrategy Stock Performance: Unstoppable MSTR Outpaces All 74 Crypto ETFs YTD In a fascinating twist for digital asset investors, MicroStrategy stock performance has stolen the spotlight this year, achieving a feat many might find surprising. According to Nate Geraci, CEO of the U.S.-based wealth management firm The ETF Store, the company formerly known as Strategy has significantly outperformed every single one of the 74 crypto-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracked year-to-date. Understanding the Surprising MicroStrategy Stock Performance MicroStrategy (MSTR) is widely recognized not just as a business intelligence software company, but increasingly, as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin (BTC). This strategic pivot has tightly linked the company’s stock performance to the volatile world of cryptocurrency. While many investors seeking crypto exposure might turn to dedicated Crypto ETFs, MSTR’s stock has proven to be a more potent vehicle for gains in the current market cycle, at least so far this year. Nate Geraci’s observation, shared on X, highlights a significant trend: despite the proliferation of regulated investment products designed to track cryptocurrencies, a single company’s stock, heavily invested in Bitcoin, has managed to lead the pack. This includes funds specifically designed for leverage, such as the MSTR ETF (MSTX), which aims to track 2x the performance of MicroStrategy’s stock itself – yet, even this leveraged vehicle lagged behind the underlying MSTR shares. Why is MSTR vs Crypto ETFs Showing Such a Disparity? The outperformance of MicroStrategy stock compared to a broad spectrum of Crypto ETFs can be attributed to several factors: Concentrated Bitcoin Exposure: MSTR’s strategy is laser-focused on accumulating Bitcoin. While many crypto ETFs offer exposure to a basket of digital assets or Bitcoin futures, MSTR provides a more direct, albeit leveraged through its corporate structure, play on the price movement of the leading cryptocurrency. Investor Perception and Flow: For many investors, particularly institutional ones, buying MSTR stock is seen as a relatively accessible and regulated way to gain significant exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset or navigating the complexities of various crypto ETF structures. This consistent demand can drive the stock price. Business Operations Multiplier: While Bitcoin holdings are the primary driver of recent MSTR performance, the company still has an operational business. The market valuation of MSTR often reflects not just the value of its Bitcoin treasury, but also a premium placed on the company as a unique investment vehicle, potentially amplifying gains during bullish crypto cycles. ETF Structure and Fees: Crypto ETFs have varying structures (spot, futures, baskets) and come with management fees. These factors, along with potential tracking errors or diversification across less performing assets within a basket ETF, can dilute or lag the performance compared to a single, highly focused stock like MSTR during a strong Bitcoin rally. The Role of MicroStrategy as a Bitcoin Corporate Holder MicroStrategy pioneered the strategy of holding significant amounts of Bitcoin on its corporate balance sheet. Led by Michael Saylor, the company has aggressively acquired BTC, making it the most prominent Bitcoin Corporate Holder globally. This commitment has transformed MSTR into a de facto Bitcoin investment vehicle for many, influencing its market valuation far beyond its core software business. This unique position means that when Bitcoin’s price surges, MSTR’s stock tends to react strongly, often with amplified volatility compared to Bitcoin itself or diversified crypto funds. The market essentially values MSTR based heavily on its per-share Bitcoin holdings, plus a premium (or sometimes a discount) related to its operational business and debt used for acquisitions. What Does This Mean for Crypto ETF Performance and Investors? The fact that MSTR has outperformed 74 different Crypto ETFs highlights the diverse and sometimes complex landscape of digital asset investing: Not All Crypto Exposure is Equal: This performance gap underscores that different investment vehicles offering ‘crypto exposure’ can yield vastly different results due to structure, fees, underlying assets, and market dynamics. Due Diligence is Crucial: Investors considering crypto-related investments must look beyond just the ‘crypto’ label. Understanding the specific strategy, holdings, fees, and structure of an ETF – or the unique nature of a stock like MSTR – is vital. MSTR’s Unique Position: MSTR isn’t a typical tech stock anymore, nor is it a typical ETF. Its performance is a testament to its specific, high-conviction Bitcoin accumulation strategy and the market’s reaction to it. While Nate Geraci’s data point is compelling for year-to-date performance, it’s crucial for investors to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results. The dynamics that favored MSTR in the recent period could shift. Actionable Insights for Navigating MSTR and Crypto ETFs Given the insights from the recent Crypto ETF Performance data, here are some points for investors to consider: Understand Your Goal: Are you seeking broad crypto market exposure, specific Bitcoin exposure, or a leveraged play? Your goal should dictate your investment vehicle. Evaluate Structure and Risk: MSTR comes with corporate risk, debt risk (from borrowing to buy BTC), and stock market volatility in addition to Bitcoin price risk. ETFs have risks related to tracking error, counterparty exposure (especially futures ETFs), and management fees. Compare Fees: ETF expense ratios can eat into returns over time. While MSTR doesn’t have an explicit management fee like an ETF, its operational costs and debt financing have implications. Diversification: Relying heavily on a single stock like MSTR for crypto exposure concentrates risk. Crypto ETFs, even basket ones, can offer some level of diversification within the digital asset space, though this didn’t guarantee outperformance this year. Stay Informed: Follow experts like Nate Geraci and analyze the underlying drivers of performance for both individual stocks and ETFs. The story of MicroStrategy stock performance outpacing a wide array of Crypto ETFs this year serves as a powerful reminder that the path to digital asset exposure is multifaceted and requires careful consideration. Conclusion: A Surprising Leader in the Crypto Investment Race Nate Geraci’s observation that MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock has outperformed all 74 tracked crypto ETFs year-to-date is a significant data point in the evolving narrative of cryptocurrency investing. It underscores the unique position MicroStrategy holds as a Bitcoin Corporate Holder and the market’s current appetite for this specific type of leveraged Bitcoin exposure through a public company structure. While Crypto ETF Performance offers regulated and varied ways to access the digital asset market, MSTR’s concentrated bet on Bitcoin has delivered superior returns in the recent bullish environment. Investors should use this information to deepen their understanding of the different vehicles available, weigh the associated risks and benefits, and make informed decisions aligned with their own investment strategy.

The recent drop from the upper bound has pushed BTC back below the 20 and 50 EMA lines ($109,144 and $108,244), while the price now flirts with Bollinger Band midlines and support clusters near $108,500. From a pattern perspective, the structure resembles a rising wedge breakdown or a rounded top, especially after repeated failures to breach the $110,400–$110,800 supply zone.

Five commissioners are supposed to make up the CFTC, and no more than three can be from the same political party.Goldsmith Romero said that during her tenure, all the commissioners had different perspectives and experiences that, when brought together, were “really helpful.”“So what happens if the CFTC gets down to one and gets new authority for crypto? It’s going to be really, really hard; you’re not going to have the same push and pull,” she said.The Trump administration has floated the idea of handing the reins of crypto regulation to the CFTC in the past.

2025-05-28T02:11:48.000Z,"Real-world assets could revitalize dying NFT lending market: DappRadar","Real-world assets linking up with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is one of a few key catalysts that could reignite the waning NFT lending sector, which is suffering from a collapse in volumes and user activity, says blockchain analytics platform DappRadar.Volumes in the NFT lending market, which allows NFT holders to take out a loan against their token, have dropped 97% from a peak of around $1 billion in January 2024 to $50 million in May, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a May 27 report.Gherghelas said for NFT lending to “move beyond survival mode,” it needs “new catalysts” to reignite the sector, such as real-world asset NFTs, like tokenized real estate or yield-bearing assets that could unlock more stable, trusted collateral sources.“So far, 2025 has not delivered a compelling reason for NFT lending to bounce back,” she said. “While the infrastructure is still here and the platforms remain active, activity has slowed across the board.” Borrower and leading activity have taken a big hit in the NFT lending sector. Source: DappRadar“For now, the sector seems to be in a holding pattern, waiting either for market recovery or a new use case to reignite interest.”Gherghelas added that other catalysts that could rekindle NFT lending were tools that make it easier for NFT holders to borrow against their tokens, and that protocols should create “smart infrastructure” such as undercollateralized loans, credit scores and artificial intelligence risk matching.The report adds that since January last year, borrower activity has declined by 90% and those willing to lend have shrunk by 78%.The average NFT loan size has also taken a hit from a peak of $22,000 in 2022 to $4,000 in May, a 71% year-over-year drop.Gherghelas said this shift “shows that either users are borrowing against lower-value assets or simply becoming more conservative with leverage.”NFT lending overall trading volume and market activity have dropped off from the all-time highs of past years. Source: DappRadarThe average loan duration is also lower; after hitting an average of roughly 40 days in 2023, it’s been down to 31 days and has held steady throughout 2024 and into 2025.Gherghelas said this could indicate that “loans are being taken more frequently but for shorter periods, perhaps a sign of more tactical liquidity plays.”NFT ﻿market downturn also hurts lendingPart of the slowdown in NFT lending is connected to the overall NFT market decline, which has seen volumes drop 61% in the first quarter to $1.5 billion compared to $4.1 billion a year ago.“With collateral value collapsing, the lending activity naturally followed,” Gherghelas said. “There are a few exceptions that managed to hold or regain traction, but they’ve been outliers, not enough to lift the sector.”Related: AI decentralized apps are coming for the Web3 throne: DappRadarThe protocol landscape has also narrowed, and the number of active NFT lending apps is limited, with only eight protocols holding any meaningful share.“The flip-for-liquidity model that worked during bull markets isn’t built for a quieter, more risk-averse environment. But that doesn’t mean NFT lending is finished; it’s simply shifting focus,” Gherghelas said.“Platforms are diversifying, use cases are shifting, and collateral preferences are changing. If the next wave builds on utility, culture, and better design, NFT lending might just find its second wind — one built to last.”Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-world-assets-revitalize-dying-nft-lending-dappradar?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

SharpLink will invest $425 million to acquire 120,000 ETH. Ethereum futures open interest hits an all-time high of $36.1 billion, with ETH price climbing 4.5% on the daily chart. Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming (SBET) announced a $425 million private investment in public equity (PIPE), acquiring approximately 69.1 million shares at $6.15 each to establish the first Nasdaq-listed Ethereum (ETH) treasury company.Spearheaded by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, this move mirrors Strategy’s (MSTR) successful Bitcoin treasury strategy, which has yielded over $8.2 billion in gains in 2025, by leveraging stock and bond sales to acquire BTC.Former Ethereum core developer and contributor Eric Conner highlighted the bullish implications of SharpLink’s move, noting its potential to create a “public ETH proxy for funds that can’t hold tokens directly.” Conner emphasized that the acquisition of 120,000 ETH—likely to be staked—could lead to “supply compression” by removing tokens from circulation. The Ether proponent also pointed to the “new narrative fuel” this provides, positioning ETH as a “digital reserve collateral” and potentially driving its adoption on mainstream balance sheets through an equity wrapper like $SBET.However, crypto analyst VICTOR cautioned against over-enthusiasm, outlining the risk of leveraging gains from an altcoin still down 19% in 2025. In Q1 2025, Cointelegraph reported a sharp decline in Ethereum network fees, dropping to $605,000 from $2.5 million in just two weeks in March, alongside a noticeable decrease in decentralized app (DApp) activity.

The majority of these rallies—eight out of ten—resulted in negative returns, while one rally triggered a short squeeze, driving prices higher, and another displayed neutral price action.From a technical perspective, Ether’s price action on the daily chart posted a descending triangle, a bullish breakout pattern, which creates equal highs and higher lows, converging toward an imminent rally. The pattern is bordered by two trendlines, the upper resistance, currently around $2,700 and the ascending support line. A bullish breakout above $2,677 targets the pattern’s measured move, calculated by adding the triangle’s height to the breakout point.

2025-05-27T21:52:14.000Z,"Growing BTC reserve requires Congressional legislation — VanEck exec","Building a permanent US strategic Bitcoin reserve would likely require targeted legislation rather than executive action, according to VanEck’s head of digital assets, Matthew Sigel. Speaking at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, Sigel said the most viable path forward may involve inserting Bitcoin mining incentives into the congressional budget reconciliation process.According to Sigel, the most effective path to growing a US strategic Bitcoin reserve would be through targeted amendments to congressional budget legislation. These could include tax credits for mining companies that use methane gas and other incentives aimed at encouraging miners to share a portion of their mined BTC with the federal government. He argued that such an approach would allow the reserve to grow organically over time. Sigel also highlighted the limitations of executive actions in achieving this goal:\""The problem with executive action is that it's going to prompt lawsuits. And anything over $100 million is going to get sued by the Elizabeth Warrens of the world. So, I would say start with something maybe in the Exchange Stabilization Fund for $100 million.\""US President Donald Trump established the US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve through a March 7 executive order.

FalconX, a digital asset broker, said it secured a facility worth over $100 million as part of a “broader credit framework,” while Maple Finance reportedly closed the first tranche of an agreement with Cantor.The service allows companies holding Bitcoin to borrow funds and use the cryptocurrency as collateral, providing a way to unlock liquidity without selling their BTC holdings. Cantor announced its Bitcoin financing business with an initial capital of $2 billion in July 2024, targeting institutional investors seeking to leverage their Bitcoin. At the time, the company said Anchorage Digital and Copper would serve as custodians and collateral managers in the venture.Credit markets are a fundamental part of the financial system, allowing capital to flow between borrowers and lenders and supporting economic activity across sectors. Their central role also means they can contribute to financial distress when risks are mismanaged. While mirroring some functions of traditional finance, crypto credit markets have been operating with less regulatory oversight.Digital asset crisis of 2022 This dynamic was evident during the 2022 crisis in the digital asset sector. Celsius Network, once a leading crypto lending platform, collapsed after engaging in risky financial practices and facing allegations of fraud. Similarly, BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2022 following significant exposure to the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.  According to a report from Galaxy, the total crypto lending market, including crypto-backed collateralized debt positions (CDPs) tied to stablecoins, stood at $36.5 billion in the last quarter of 2024, marking a 43% decline from its all-time high of $64.4 billion in 2021. Despite the broader contraction, onchain lending platforms have seen a dramatic rebound, with open borrowed positions surging to $19.1 billion by Q4 2024, a 959% increase over two years.

The macroeconomic-focused Bitcoin newsletter highlighted that the National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) shows a rapid shift to ultra-loose territory after a tightening phase in February 2025. The NFCI, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, tracks stress in the financial system by aggregating measures like credit spreads, leverage, and funding conditions.

2025-05-27T15:40:00.000Z,"93% of all Bitcoin is already mined. Here’s what that means","How much Bitcoin is left to mine?              Bitcoin’s total supply is hardcoded at 21 million BTC, a fixed upper limit that cannot be altered without a consensus-breaking change to the protocol. This finite cap is enforced at the protocol level and is central to Bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset.As of May 2025, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoin (BTC) have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created, and those remaining coins will be mined very slowly.The reason for this uneven distribution is Bitcoin’s exponential issuance schedule, governed by an event called the halving. When Bitcoin launched in 2009, the block reward was 50 BTC. Every 210,000 blocks — or approximately every four years — that reward is cut in half. Because the early rewards were so large, over 87% of the total supply was mined by the end of 2020. Each subsequent halving sharply reduces the rate of new issuance, meaning it will take over a century to mine the remaining 6.7%.According to current estimates, 99% of all Bitcoin will have been mined by 2035, but the final fraction — the last satoshis — won’t be produced until around the year 2140 due to the nature of geometric reward reduction.This engineered scarcity, combined with an immutable supply cap, is what draws comparisons between Bitcoin and physical commodities like gold. But Bitcoin is even more predictable: Gold’s supply grows at around 1.7% annually, whereas Bitcoin’s issuance rate is transparently declining.Did you know? Bitcoin’s supply curve is not terminal in the traditional sense. It follows an asymptotic trajectory — a kind of economic Zeno’s paradox — where rewards diminish indefinitely but never truly reach zero. Mining will continue until around 2140, by which point over 99.999% of the total 21 million BTC will have been issued.                  Beyond the supply cap: How lost coins make Bitcoin scarcer than you think              While over 93% of Bitcoin’s total supply has been mined, that doesn’t mean it’s all available. A significant portion is permanently out of circulation, lost due to forgotten passwords, misplaced wallets, destroyed hard drives or early adopters who never touched their coins again.Estimates from firms like Chainalysis and Glassnode suggest that between 3.0 million and 3.8 million BTC — roughly 14%-18% of the total supply — is likely gone for good. That includes high-profile dormant addresses like the one believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, which alone holds over 1.1 million BTC.This means Bitcoin’s true circulating supply may be closer to 16 million-17 million, not 21 million. And because Bitcoin is non-recoverable by design, any lost coins stay lost — permanently reducing supply over time.Now compare that to gold. Around 85% of the world’s total gold supply has been mined — approximately 216,265 metric tons, according to the World Gold Council — but nearly all of it remains in circulation or held in vaults, jewelry, ETFs and central banks. Gold can be remelted and reused; Bitcoin cannot be resurrected once access is lost.This distinction gives Bitcoin a kind of hardening scarcity, a supply that not only stops growing over time but quietly shrinks.As Bitcoin matures, it’s entering a monetary phase similar to gold: low issuance, high holder concentration and increasing demand-side sensitivity. But Bitcoin takes it further; its supply cap is hard, its loss rate is permanent, and its distribution is publicly auditable.This may lead to several outcomes:Increased price volatility as available supply becomes more limited and sensitive to market demandHigher long-term value concentration in the hands of those who remain active and secure in their key managementA premium on liquidity, where actually spendable BTC trades at a higher effective value than dormant supply.In extreme cases, this could produce a bifurcation between “circulating BTC” and “unreachable BTC,” with the former gaining greater economic significance, particularly in times of constrained exchange liquidity or macroeconomic stress.                  What happens when Bitcoin is fully mined?              There’s a popular assumption that as Bitcoin’s block rewards shrink, the network’s security will eventually suffer. But in practice, the mining economy is far more adaptive — and much more resilient — than that.Bitcoin’s mining incentives are governed by a self-correcting feedback loop: If mining becomes unprofitable, miners drop off the network, which in turn triggers a difficulty adjustment. Every 2,016 blocks (roughly every two weeks), the network recalibrates mining difficulty using a parameter known as nBits. The goal is to keep block times steady at around 10 minutes, regardless of how many miners are competing.So, if Bitcoin’s price drops, or the reward becomes too small relative to operating costs, inefficient miners simply exit. This causes difficulty to fall, lowering the cost for those who remain. The result is a system that continually rebalances itself, aligning network participation with available incentives.This mechanism has already been tested at scale. After China banned mining in mid-2021, Bitcoin’s global hashrate dropped by more than 50% in a matter of weeks. Yet the network continued to function without interruption, and within a few months, the hashrate fully recovered, as miners resumed operations in jurisdictions with lower energy costs and more favorable regulations.Critically, the idea that lower rewards will inherently threaten network security overlooks how mining is tied to profit margins, not nominal BTC amounts. As long as the market price supports the cost of hash power — even at 0.78125 BTC per block (post-2028 halving) or lower — miners will continue to secure the network.In other words, it’s not the absolute reward that matters, but whether mining remains profitable relative to costs. And thanks to Bitcoin’s built-in difficulty adjustment, it usually does.Even a century from now, when the block reward approaches zero, the network will likely still be protected by whatever combination of fees, base incentives and infrastructure efficiency exists at that time. But that’s a distant concern. In the meantime, the current system — hashrate adjusts, difficulty rebalances, miners adapt — remains one of the most robust elements of Bitcoin’s design.Did you know? On April 20, 2024, following the launch of the Runes protocol, Bitcoin miners earned over $80 million in transaction fees within a single day, surpassing the $26 million earned from block rewards. This marked the first time in Bitcoin’s history that transaction fees alone exceeded the block subsidy in daily miner revenue.                  The future of Bitcoin mining: Energy consumption              It’s a common misconception that rising Bitcoin prices will drive endless energy use. In reality, mining is constrained by profitability, not price alone.As block rewards shrink, miners are pushed toward thinner margins, and that means chasing the cheapest, cleanest energy available. Since China’s 2021 mining ban, hashrate has migrated to regions like North America and Northern Europe, where operators tap into surplus hydro, wind and underutilized grid energy.According to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, between 52% and 59% of Bitcoin mining now runs on renewables or low-emission sources. Regulations are reinforcing this trend, with several jurisdictions offering incentives for clean-powered mining or penalizing fossil-fuel operations.Moreover, the idea that higher BTC prices will always mean higher energy use misses how Bitcoin self-regulates: More miners raise difficulty, which compresses margins, capping energy expansion. Renewable-based mining brings its own challenges, but the dystopian future of endlessly expanding fossil-fueled hash power is increasingly unlikely.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/93-of-all-bitcoin-is-already-mined-heres-what-that-means?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T15:00:00.000Z,"ZKPs can prove I&#039;m old enough without telling you my age","Opinion by: Andre Omietanski, General Counsel, and Amal Ibraymi, Legal Counsel at Aztec LabsWhat if you could prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthday, name, or anything else at all? Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) make this hypothetical a reality and solve one of the key challenges online: verifying age without sacrificing privacy. The need for better age verification todayWe're witnessing an uptick in laws being proposed restricting minors' access to social media and the internet, including in Australia, Florida, and China. To protect minors from inappropriate adult content, platform owners and governments often walk a tightrope between inaction and overreach. For example, the state of Louisiana in the US recently enacted a law meant to block minors from viewing porn. Sites required users to upload an ID before viewing content. The Free Speech Coalition challenged the law as unconstitutional, making the case that it infringed on First Amendment rights. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed on procedural grounds. The reaction, however, highlights the dilemma facing policymakers and platforms: how to block minors without violating adults' rights or creating new privacy risks.Traditional age verification failsCurrent age verification tools are either ineffective or invasive. Self-declaration is meaningless, since users can simply lie about their age. ID-based verification is overly invasive. No one should be required to upload their most sensitive documents, putting themselves at risk of data breaches and identity theft. Biometric solutions like fingerprints and face scans are convenient for users but raise important ethical, privacy, and security concerns. Biometric systems are not always accurate and may generate false positives and negatives. The irreversible nature of the data, which can't be changed like a regular password can, is also less than ideal. Other methods, like behavioral tracking and AI-driven verification of browser patterns, are also problematic, using machine learning to analyze user interactions and identify patterns and anomalies, raising concerns of a surveillance culture.ZKPs as the privacy-preserving solutionZero-knowledge proofs present a compelling solution. Like a government ID provider, a trusted entity verifies the user's age and generates a cryptographic proof confirming they are over the required age. Websites only need to check the proof, not the excess personal data, ensuring privacy while keeping minors at the gates. No centralized data storage is required, alleviating the burden on platforms such as Google, Meta, and WhatsApp and eliminating the risk of data breaches. Recent: How zero-knowledge proofs can make AI fairerAdopting and enforcing ZKPs at scaleZKPs aren't a silver bullet. They can be complex to implement. The notion of \""don't trust, verify,\"" proven by indisputable mathematics, may cause some regulatory skepticism. Policymakers may hesitate to trust cryptographic proofs over visible ID verification. There are occasions when companies may need to disclose personal information to authorities, such as during an investigation into financial crimes or government inquiries. This would challenge ZKPs, whose very intention is for platforms not to hold this data in the first place.ZKPs also struggle with scalability and performance, being somewhat computationally intensive and tricky to program. Efficient implementation techniques are being explored, and breakthroughs, such as the Noir programming language, are making ZKPs more accessible to developers, driving the adoption of secure, privacy-first solutions. A safer, smarter future for age verificationGoogle's move to adopt ZKPs for age verification is a promising signal that mainstream platforms are beginning to embrace privacy-preserving technologies. But to fully realize the potential of ZKPs, we need more than isolated solutions locked into proprietary ecosystems. Crypto-native wallets can go further. Open-source and permissionless blockchain-based systems offer interoperability, composability, and programmable identity. With a single proof, users can access a range of services across the open web — no need to start from scratch every time, or trust a single provider (Google) with their credentials.ZKPs flip the script on online identity — proving what matters, without exposing anything else. They protect user privacy, help platforms stay compliant, and block minors from restricted content, all without creating new honeypots of sensitive data.Google's adoption of ZKPs shows mainstream momentum is building. But to truly transform digital identity, we must embrace crypto-native, decentralized systems that give users control over what they share and who they are online.In an era defined by surveillance, ZKPs offer a better path forward — one that's secure, private, and built for the future.Opinion by: Andre Omietanski, General Counsel, and Amal Ibraymi, Legal Counsel at Aztec Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-27T14:30:00.000Z,"What is a cryptocurrency mixer and how does it work?","Cryptocurrency mixers explained              A cryptocurrency mixer is a specialized service designed to increase the privacy and anonymity of blockchain transactions. Unlike traditional financial transactions, which are private by default, most cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) operate on public blockchains. This means every transaction is permanently recorded and accessible to anyone, making it possible for blockchain analysts or malicious actors to trace the flow of funds between wallets.A crypto mixer’s primary function is to break the link between the sender’s wallet and the recipient’s wallet. It does so by pooling together coins from many users and then redistributing them in a way that makes it difficult to track which coins went where. Think of it like a digital version of shuffling cards in a deck. After mixing, your cryptocurrency is returned to you or a recipient’s address, but it’s “cleaned” of any direct transaction history.This privacy-enhancing feature is why some people rely on mixers, especially those seeking to keep their financial activities confidential in an open-ledger world.                  How does a crypto mixer work?              To understand a crypto mixer, it’s useful to compare it to the concept of money laundering in traditional finance, albeit with legal and ethical nuances. The process of “mixing” is essentially designed to obscure the origin and destination of coins.Here’s a typical workflow of how a cryptocurrency mixer operates:Deposit: You send your cryptocurrency to the mixer’s wallet address. Multiple users do the same, creating a large pool of coins.Mixing/shuffling: The mixer’s system pools and shuffles these coins together, breaking any visible connection between deposited and withdrawn funds.Redistribution: After mixing, the service sends back an equivalent amount of coins to your specified address, but these aren’t the same coins you deposited. They come from the pooled coins of all participants.Fees: The mixer usually deducts a small fee, generally ranging from 1% to 3%, to cover operational costs.This process effectively disrupts blockchain analysis, making it extremely difficult for anyone to trace the coins back to their original owners.                  Types of cryptocurrency mixers              Not all mixers are created equal. They can broadly be divided into two categories: centralized and decentralized mixers.Centralized mixersCentralized mixers are the most common and operate similarly to traditional services. You send your coins to a company or entity that controls the mixing process, and then they send back “clean” coins after mixing. These services are relatively easy to use, often providing a simple user interface.However, centralized mixers require you to trust the service operator with your coins, at least temporarily. This introduces risks such as:The mixer could be a scam and disappear with your funds.It could be hacked, exposing users’ data and coins.The operator may keep logs that could compromise your privacy.Decentralized mixersDecentralized mixers use blockchain technology and smart contracts to automate the mixing process without a trusted third party. They rely on cryptographic methods such as zero-knowledge proofs to mix coins in a trustless environment. Users pool their coins into a smart contract, which then redistributes coins in a way that ensures privacy.Advantages of decentralized mixers include:No central point of failure or custody risk.Higher privacy because no single party controls the funds.Often more resistant to regulatory crackdowns.Did you know? The DOJ indicted four Russians for operating crypto mixers Blender.io and Sinbad.io, yet failed to show they knowingly laundered illicit funds. The indictment relies heavily on vague forum posts and lacks concrete evidence of criminal intent or ties to US commerce, raising serious doubts about its strength in court.                  Real-world cases involving mixers and scams              Unfortunately, the privacy offered by crypto mixers has also attracted criminals. The very anonymity that protects innocent users can also shield illicit activities, leading to widespread misuse.Crypto mixers have been linked to ransomware attacks, dark web marketplaces, fraud and drug trafficking. Criminals often use these services to “clean” proceeds from illegal transactions and hide their tracks from law enforcement.A notable example is ChipMixer, a service seized by Europol in 2023 for allegedly facilitating money laundering for dark web markets and ransomware groups. Authorities dismantled the platform’s infrastructure over alleged money laundering, seizing four servers, 1,909.4 BTC (about $210 million as of May 26, 2025) and seven TB of data across 55 transactions.Mixers have also been involved in laundering stolen funds from cryptocurrency exchange hacks. The complexity of these transactions makes it difficult for investigators to recover stolen assets.In February 2025, Bybit, a major cryptocurrency exchange, suffered a significant security breach resulting in the theft of about $1.5 billion worth of cryptocurrencies. The attackers, attributed to the Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking organization, employed various crypto mixers, including Wasabi, CryptoMixer, Railgun and Tornado Cash, to launder portions of the stolen assets. Despite efforts to trace the funds, a significant portion remains unaccounted for, highlighting the challenges posed by mixers in cybersecurity investigations.                  Are crypto mixers legal?              The legal status of cryptocurrency mixers depends largely on the jurisdiction and context of their use.Most governments impose strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing regulations on financial services, including digital currency services. Mixers, by their nature, complicate AML compliance because they obscure transaction trails.For instance,In the European Union, the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD) includes digital currency providers under its regulatory scope, requiring them to perform KYC checks and report suspicious activity.In the United States, FinCEN classifies cryptocurrency mixers as money transmitters, requiring registration and compliance with AML regulations. Unlicensed mixers can face severe penalties and criminal charges.Legal uses vs misuseUsing a mixer for privacy reasons is not inherently illegal. However, if mixers are used to launder proceeds from crimes, authorities will prosecute offenders. Similarly, operating a mixer without appropriate licenses or regulatory oversight can be illegal.If you choose to use a mixer, make sure you understand the legal implications in your country and avoid any activity that could be linked to money laundering or fraud.Did you know? Crypto mixer transactions are still taxable. Using a mixer doesn’t hide gains from tax authorities; failing to report them can trigger audits or penalties. Always keep records and understand your local tax obligations.                  How to stay safe and avoid scam-linked mixers              If you decide to use a cryptocurrency mixer, your safety and security should be paramount. Here are some essential tips to avoid scams and legal troubles:Choose reputable mixers: Conduct thorough research. Look for mixers with good reviews, transparent operations and clear compliance policies.Avoid unknown or suspicious services: Steer clear of mixers linked to scams, hacks or regulatory actions.Check for licensing and compliance: Prefer mixers that comply with AML/KYC regulations, especially if you are a business or high-value user.Understand fees and timelines: Be clear on the fees involved and the expected time for your funds to be returned after mixing.Use hardware wallets and strong security practices: Always safeguard your private keys and use hardware wallets to minimize risks.Stay updated on regulations: Laws surrounding crypto mixers evolve rapidly. Staying informed will help you avoid inadvertent legal violations.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-mixer-and-how-does-it-work?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

With thousands of projects emerging or disappearing, you need innovative ways to separate signal from noise. AI solutions such as ChatGPT and Grok could benefit you as your research assistant, reducing research time and delivering actionable information. This article discusses how to use both platforms to make better decisions regarding investment in altcoins.How to share content with ChatGPT and GrokBoth ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 allow you to share content in three ways. You can simply paste content in the text box with inverted commas and write your prompt. Alternatively, you can upload a document from your local drive or Google Drive on ChatGPT 4o. If you are working with Grok 3, you could upload a file from your local drive or connect a file on Google Drive and Microsoft Drive to the AI platform.On both ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3, you can paste a link in the text box and write a prompt for the AI engine.Use ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 to analyze complex data and draw quick conclusionsChatGPT 4o excels at processing and simplifying extensive and often fragmented information. Altcoin projects tend to have extensive white papers and technical documentation. It takes time to get through all the information, analyze it, and draw conclusions. With ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3, you can easily get the information you need without spending hours reading the content. You can use the AI platforms for:Summarizing extensive documentation: You could get a quick summary of vast information that might go into thousands of words, using a prompt like “Summarize this document in plain English with pros, cons and use cases.”Analyzing tokenomics: You could ask the AI platforms for the altcoin project’s breakdown of inflation, token distribution and staking models. For example, you could use a prompt such as “Explain the tokenomics of [Altcoin Name] and its impact on price.” Deconstructing roadmaps: Projects often publish unrealistic roadmaps that are hard to implement. AI platforms could quickly analyze the relevancy of roadmaps and suggest to you what you could expect of them. You could use prompts like, “What are the most realistic milestones in this roadmap for 2025?”Spotting red flags: The goal is not just to understand but to spot red flags, such as overpromising, vague goals or lack of technical updates. Did you know? ChatGPT is trained on vast crypto data sets and can explain trends, decode memes, or simplify DeFi tools — even if you are just starting your crypto learning journey.Ask for competitive comparisons on ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 can be valuable tools for quickly comparing different cryptocurrency projects. To begin with, state the names of the cryptocurrencies you want to compare. Also mention the criteria such as use case, consensus process, tokenomics and development activities. For example, you can use the prompt, “Create a table comparing Solana and Avalanche in terms of transaction speed, fees and developer adoption.” Here is a response from ChatGPT 4o:And this is Grok 3’s response for the same prompt:AI tools typically use tables or bullet points for an answer. You can also ask additional questions to delve deeper into topics like security, scalability and partnerships. This allows for more efficient evaluation of many projects without the need to search through multiple sources.To get a market-layer view on ChatGPT 4o, you can use the prompt: “Create a table of five layer-1 altcoins with higher throughput than Ethereum and evaluate their adoption metrics.” Here is the output of ChatGPT 4o:Grok 3 gave the following response using the same prompt:These comparisons help you map out where each altcoin stands relative to its peers and whether it offers a genuine edge.Did you know? Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot was built with a rebellious tone. It excels at quickly pulling crypto insights directly from social chatter, perfect for memecoin hunters.Find info about developer activityDeveloper traction is a dependable indicator of an altcoin’s long-term potential. Use ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 to find information about overall growth in development activity, surges after certain upgrades, developer count and contributions, commit activity, network upgrades and challenges before developers.You could use prompts like:“What has been the developer activity trend on [Project ] over the last 6 months?”You can also request ecosystem breakdowns with prompts like:“List top DeFi projects built on Arbitrum with TVL over $10 million.”ChatGPT 4o generated the following response for this prompt:Here is Grok 3’s response for the same prompt:ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 can synthesize data points from multiple sources and give you a cleaner picture faster than manual web browsing. You could track sudden price spikes with a prompt like:“In 100 words, write why is $RNDR trending right now?”Here is ChatGPT 4o’s response for this prompt:This is Grok 3’s response for the same prompt:Grok 3 is particularly useful for monitoring real-time sentiment and news. Grok 3 is ideal for real-time analysis of trends, especially on X, where crypto narratives form quickly. Grok 3 will pull recent posts, mentions and news threads to explain the momentum. It can monitor influencer sentiment.For deeper and quicker research, you can use ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 together.Don’t just trust the bots — verify the alphaAI tools like ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 offer powerful support in the altcoin research process, enabling faster analysis, broader comparisons and streamlined access to information. However, even advanced AI models can occasionally misinterpret data or miss contextual nuances. As such, it is essential to treat their responses as a starting point — not a final answer.When using these tools, take the time to compare outputs, evaluate the sources referenced, and cross-check insights against real-world data. Discrepancies between ChatGPT and Grok responses should prompt further investigation, not automatic preference.Ultimately, these platforms are most effective when used to enhance critical thinking and research efficiency rather than replace human judgment.In a fast-moving industry like Web3, effective research requires diligence, curiosity and verification. By applying these principles, you can make more confident and informed investment decisions in the altcoin space.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-27T12:00:15.000Z,"StarkWare launches mobile-friendly zero-knowledge prover","Blockchain company StarkWare has unveiled zero-knowledge (ZK) prover STARK Two (S-two), enabling enhanced privacy and verification on everyday devices like phones, laptops and browsers. The company said the new ZK prover allows users to generate complex cryptographic proofs from the client side. This means users can generate ZK-proofs directly on their devices instead of relying on a server or cloud infrastructure, opening the door for faster and more private applications across the internet. “S-two will bring STARK proving to everyday devices, and open the door for new real-world proving use cases,” said Eli Ben-Sasson, StarkWare co-founder and CEO, adding that the tool could empower the next wave of ZK applications. The company said the ZK prover is now available in public alpha and is set to roll out on Starknet, its Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, later this year.  StarkWare says new ZK prover is 39 times faster than old solutions StarkWare said that benchmark tests for the S-two ZK prover showed that it was 39 times faster than previous solutions. The performance leap enables smoother experiences in privacy-enhancing applications. The upgrade also allows use cases in private transactions, ZK-based identity and verifiable artificial intelligence. StarkWare said S-two runs on CPUs, GPUs and will soon be on browsers. “For years we’ve called the prover our magic wand, a tool that transforms complex computation into a simple proof,” Ben-Sasson said. “Now, the wand has become a lightsaber in your pocket, something anyone can wield, instantly, from your own device.”According to StarkWare, developers can build with S-two, adding that its alpha release supports hardware targets. Furthermore, the company said ZK ecosystem participants like Kakarot, Nexus, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs have already adopted the technology. Kakarot uses S-two inside ETHProofs to generate Ethereum block proofs more efficiently, while Nexus is standardizing RISC-V traces to align with S-two’s architecture. Meanwhile, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs are adding GPU acceleration to push the prover’s performance even further.Use cases for S-two zero-knowledge proverStarkWare chief operating officer Oren Katz told Cointelegraph that S-two marks a shift in how ZK-proofs are used in daily lives. Generating validity proofs directly in devices will allow privacy-preserving features in messaging, payments and digital identity. “You can prove a payment was valid without showing your balance, or verify identity without revealing personal details,” Katz added. Katz said that even salary payments could be made onchain with full transparency and no exposure of sensitive information. He dubbed the development a “big step toward bringing zero-knowledge tech into the mainstream.”Beyond privacy, Katz said, local proof generation also unlocks use cases in other industries. The executive told Cointelegraph that it can allow gamers to play offline and later generate cryptographic proof of their achievements. “An operator, instead of running all logic onchain to prove integrity, can run it on their own servers and simply generate a proof that it was executed correctly,” Katz added.Related: Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden’s cashless-society rethinkNew ZK prover follows Ethereum’s privacy pushThe launch of StarWare’s upgraded ZK prover follows Ethereum’s push for better privacy. On April 11, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin published a roadmap that addressed privacy enhancements for wallets, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and infrastructure. Buterin advocated implementing privacy-enhancing norms and features across the Ethereum ecosystem, including adding privacy tools in ETH wallets. Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/starkware-unveils-s-two-client-side-zk-prover?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

According to a Pendle report, yield-bearing stablecoins climbed from $1.5 billion at the start of 2024 to $11 billion as of May 21. This represents 4.5% of the entire stablecoin market. The growth of yield-bearing stablecoins is attributed to increasing regulatory clarity in the United States under President Donald Trump’s administration. According to a Feb. 18 filing, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved exchange operator Figure Markets’ interest-bearing stablecoin. This made the company the first to receive US approval for a yield-bearing stablecoin. Apart from a favorable response from the SEC, proposed bills like the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) also signal a positive direction for stablecoins in the US. Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitget-enters-real-world-asset-race-with-yield-bearing-bgusd-stablecoin?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T08:45:00.000Z,"How central banks are testing blockchain-based monetary policy","Why are central banks looking at blockchains?              Central banks are tiptoeing into the world of blockchain not because it is fashionable but because every part of the money-making machine, from settlement rails to asset custody, is slowly being rewritten as code.The financial industry is already tokenizing money-market funds, Treasurys and even bank deposits. According to the Atlantic Council, 134 jurisdictions are studying or piloting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), up from just 35 in 2020. Meanwhile, commercial banks have begun to warn that if they cannot move tokenized deposits across public blockchains such as Solana or private ledgers like R3 Corda, they risk being left behind.From a central bank’s vantage point, two questions matter:First, can traditional operations, such as open-market purchases, standing facilities and reserve remuneration still work if reserves and government bonds become smart tokens? Second, can monetary transmission improve when policy logic is hard-wired into code? These questions motivate pilots such as Project Pine, Project Guardian in Singapore, the Bank of England’s wholesale CBDC sandbox and Japan’s multiyear retail CBDC pilot.                  What is “tokenized” monetary policy?              Tokenized monetary policy means that the liabilities and assets a central bank uses to steer short-term interest rates exist as programmable tokens on a distributed-ledger platform. In such a token arrangement, what the BIS describes as an ecosystem where money and securities share a common ledger, monetary functions are executed by smart contracts, replacing the traditional batch file processes used in overnight real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems.In practice, each policy tool is expressed as code:Interest on reserves becomes an automated coupon that accrues to a wallet address once a block closes.Repo and reverse-repo agreements become conditional asset swaps that self-liquidate at maturity.Collateral haircuts are numeric parameters the central bank can toggle in real time, with changes propagating instantly to all counterparties.Project Pine demonstrated all three, using ERC-20 tokens for reserves and securities on a permissioned Ethereum-compatible chain.But how is tokenized monetary policy different from traditional monetary policy?Traditional policy operations rely on central bank systems such as Fedwire or the Bank of England’s RTGS. These systems close overnight, settle in discrete batches and require multiple human sign-offs. A tokenized system settles atomically in seconds, keeps an immutable audit trail and lets policy adjustments propagate without waiting for dealers to book trades. The BIS paper on tokenisation notes that combining assets and settlement on a single ledger can shrink operational risk and latency.Did you know? A repo is a short-term secured loan in which one party sells securities and agrees to repurchase them later at a higher price. In contrast, a reverse repo is the same transaction viewed from the counterparty’s perspective (buying the securities and later reselling them).                  What is Project Pine?              Project Pine is a research initiative led by the BIS Innovation Hub and the New York Fed that explores how central banks could run monetary policy in a future where money and government securities are digital tokens managed on blockchain-like systems.Launched in late 2024 and published in May 2025, the project built a working prototype, a “starter kit” for central banks, designed to test whether tools like interest on reserves, repo operations and asset purchases can be run using smart contracts.The project ran simulated financial scenarios, mimicking both calm and crisis conditions:Normal conditions: The smart contract automatically conducted a one-day reverse-repo, draining reserves by posting bids at a pre-set interest rate.Liquidity shock: When simulated market stress pushed interest rates too high, an emergency lending facility kicked in automatically, within seconds, helping stabilize rates.Asset-purchase program: The toolkit accepted bids, calculated allocations and settled trades between digital reserves and tokenized bonds instantly.These scenarios were run in a test environment with simulated commercial banks and a programmable blockchain platform. Everything from interest payments to collateral valuation was automated, providing a glimpse into how monetary policy might function in a 24/7, tokenized financial system.This was not an isolated experiment. Other central banks are running parallel pilots that explore similar ground with their distinct approaches:Although temporarily offline as of May 24, 2025, MAS news releases show that Singapore’s Project Guardian has tested tokenized deposits and government bonds in live repo transactions, proving that interbank settlement can occur on a shared DLT without sending payments through Swift.Meanwhile, the Bank of England has taken a dual-rail approach. A July 2024 discussion paper stresses that wholesale tokenized money could sit alongside RTGS balances, letting commercial banks pick whichever rail meets their liquidity needs. Governor Andrew Bailey has warned that if tokenized deposits stall, the Bank “must continue to prepare for a wholesale CBDC.”On the retail front, Japan’s multi-year programme has entered a live “pilot” phase, constructing an end-to-end infrastructure, from smartphone wallets to a central ledger, capable of handling tens of thousands of transactions per second. The pilot also explores privacy-enhancing overlays, reflecting consumer expectations for cash-like anonymity.Taken together, these pilots confirm that key features like programmability, real-time visibility, and atomic settlement are no longer theoretical — they work. They don’t yet answer the more challenging question: How do central banks transition an entire financial system to such rails without disrupting credit creation and intermediation?Did you know? Project Pine’s digital monetary system is built like a three-layer cake: The bottom layer is a programmable blockchain (Besu), the middle is packed with tokenized money and assets (like ERC-20 reserves) and the top layer runs the smart contracts that carry out monetary policy actions.                  Why is Project Pine important?              Project Pine is the first of its kind to show that core central bank tools could be rebuilt using smart contracts. It proves that:Policy tools can be deployed faster, possibly within seconds.Facilities like repo or asset purchases can adapt automatically to changing market conditions.Tokenization could streamline operations, reduce friction and offer greater flexibility.Who was involved in Project Pine experiments?Seven major central banks, including those of Australia, Canada, England, Mexico, Switzerland, the EU and the US, collaborated on shaping the toolkit and defining test requirements. The findings don’t commit any of these banks to adopt such systems, but they provide a solid foundation for future research and policymaking.What did Project Pine test?To see how well the system works, Project Pine ran tests based on real-world situations, such as raising interest rates or a government debt crisis. They tried short and long periods, small and large financial systems, tight and loose money conditions and different ways of lending (like bank loans or corporate bonds). This helped check if the system could handle all kinds of economic ups and downs.Did you know? In Project Pine, central bank operations like paying interest on reserves or managing collateral aren’t done manually; they're handled by smart contracts coded directly into the top “protocol layer” of the blockchain stack.                  Practical design challenges in tokenized monetary policy              As central banks explore moving policy tools onto blockchains, they face several significant design hurdles. These aren’t just technical. They’re legal, operational and even philosophical. Here are the key ones:Interoperability: Can different blockchains talk to each other? Today’s financial system is like a highway with shared rules. However, blockchain ecosystems are more like separate islands, each with its own rules and roads. Public networks like Solana, private ones like Corda, or permissioned platforms like Besu don’t always “talk” to each other smoothly. This can cause issues like payment delays or funds getting stuck between platforms. Experts also warn that if too many users gather around one dominant blockchain, it could create unhealthy concentration, making the whole system more fragile.Legal finality: Does blockchain data legally count? Many countries still treat blockchain records as transaction evidence, not legally binding proof of ownership. So, even if a tokenized treasury bond moves onchain, the law might still require a separate “golden record” kept offchain by a trusted authority. Until legal systems catch up, this split could limit how far tokenized finance can go.Cyber resilience: What happens when something goes wrong? Blockchain systems run on code, and that code can have bugs. In a traditional setup, if something breaks, humans can step in. But with smart contracts, “code is law.” That’s why countries like Japan are building complete backup plans into their pilots. They’re testing how to respond to cyberattacks, technical failures or even smart contract glitches because in a digital money system, even a small error could have significant consequences.Privacy vs transparency: How much should be visible? Banks and regulators need transparency to monitor financial risks and prevent crime. But regular people want privacy, especially when using money for everyday purchases. Balancing those two needs is tricky. Policymakers are now experimenting with ideas like tiered disclosure (more visibility for big transactions), zero-knowledge proofs (which let you prove something without revealing all details), and even “anonymity vouchers” that let users make some transactions without being tracked.These challenges aren’t deal-breakers, but they do show that making money programmable isn’t as simple as flipping a switch. Central banks must work closely with lawmakers, cybersecurity experts and the financial industry to ensure tokenized monetary systems are safe, fair and reliable.                  The road ahead              The future of tokenized monetary policy will likely unfold in carefully staged phases, balancing innovation with financial stability.The BIS Innovation Hub lists more than a dozen ongoing tokenization projects from Australia’s Project Dunbar (multi-CBDC bridge) to Switzerland’s Project Helvetia (DLT-based repo). Commercial banks, meanwhile, are shifting rails: HSBC settled its first tokenized-deposit payment in April 2025, and Euroclear is piloting blockchain settlement for tokenized bonds.Central banks face a coordination game: Go slow and risk private standards hardening around them; go too fast and upend the funding model of commercial banks. The likeliest path is a phased approach:Stage 1: Limited-scope wholesale CBDC sandboxes plus tokenized collateral for central-bank counterparties.Stage 2: Dual-rail environments where RTGS balances and tokenized reserves interoperate via synchronization layers.Stage 3: Full adoption of smart-contract-based policy tools, possibly including real-time fiscal transfers.Just as earlier shifts like the rollout of RTGS systems or inflation-targeting regimes were introduced gradually to test and refine their impact, tokenized systems will be phased in through pilots, sandboxes and hybrid models before full-scale adoption.Whether it ultimately reshapes how central banks manage the economy remains to be seen.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-central-banks-are-testing-blockchain-based-monetary-policy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The initiative, currently under review by the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Thailand, will enable tourists to link their crypto holdings to credit cards for local purchases.Merchants will receive Thai baht as usual, often without knowing crypto was used in the transaction. The pilot is expected to roll out after key infrastructure and regulatory checks are in place.“This approach can be immediately adapted for Thailand, provided the supporting systems are in place,” said Pichai, noting that the model avoids using the Thai baht directly, reducing risks to the domestic currency.Related: Crypto exchange KuCoin enters crowded Thailand marketCapital markets regulation under reviewBeyond enabling crypto use for tourism, Thailand is also planning a reform of its financial laws.

As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave.However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation.This caused the long-term holder realized capitalization to surge past $28 billion, a level not seen since April. Realized cap is a measure of the value of each Bitcoin based on the last time it was moved, rather than the current market price.Long-term investors are using this period of forced selling to increase their exposure and accumulate more Bitcoin for the long run, Amr Taha noted. “This strategic accumulation during moments of market stress reflects the deep conviction of LTHs.”“Rather than being shaken out by short-term volatility, they [LTH] see these liquidation-driven dips as prime opportunities to strengthen their positions, reinforcing the foundation for future price appreciation.”BTC short-term holders (red) and long-term holders (green) net realized cap.

Gox, but said proof-of-reserves isn’t the correct measure to take for institutions.“No institutional-grade or enterprise security analyst would think it’s a good idea to publish all of the wallet addresses, such that you could be traced back and forth.”“Go to AI, put it in deep think mode and then ask it ‘what are the security problems of publishing your wallet addresses?’ and ‘how might it undermine the security of your company over time,” Saylor said, adding it would write “50 pages of security problems.”Proof-of-reserves increasingly adopted after FTX collapseMany crypto exchanges, custodians and exchange-traded fund issuers started publishing their proof-of-reserves following FTX’s collapse in November 2022 to establish transparency and prove that they hold enough assets to back customer deposits.Related: Strategy bags 4,020 Bitcoin as price briefly breaks $110KCrypto exchanges Binance, Kraken and OKX and crypto asset manager Bitwise are among the industry players that have adopted the transparency measure.However, Saylor noted that proof-of-reserves often only show one side of the picture — what the company holds — and not what they owe.Source: Mitchell AskewSaylor’s Strategy is the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 576,230 Bitcoin worth $62.6 million on its balance sheet, followed by Bitcoin mining firm MARA Holdings, which holds 48,137 Bitcoin, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET.More than 110 publicly traded companies worldwide have purchased and hold Bitcoin.Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/michael-saylor-says-proof-of-reserves-bad-idea?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: Patrick Patterson/X Meta is already experimenting with a system called retrieval augmented generation (RAG), which is a method of enhancing LLM outputs using external knowledge sources.In February, it released V-JEPA, a non-generative model that learns by predicting missing or masked parts of a video.Related: Meta gets EU regulator nod to train AI with social media contentLeCun believes that “world-based models” would be a better approach as these would be trained on real-life scenarios and possess higher cognition than current pattern-based AI. The concept involves models that can imagine taking an action and predict the resulting world state. Since the world has infinite unpredictable possibilities, LeCun believes training must happen through abstraction, which mirrors how humans make sense of the physical world.Meta’s AI brain drain Meanwhile, Meta is experiencing significant talent loss from its AI research team, particularly among the researchers who created the original Llama model in 2023, Insider reported on May 26. Just three of the original 14 Llama authors remain at Meta, and many have joined Mistral, a Paris-based startup co-founded by former Meta researchers and key Llama architects. Meta’s latest release, Llama 4, received a lukewarm reception from developers, many of whom now look to faster-moving rivals that have dedicated reasoning models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o, Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, and the recently launched Claude 4 Sonnet from Anthropic, the report added. On May 15, The Wall Street Journal reported that Meta was delaying the rollout of its flagship AI LLM, Llama 4 “Behemoth.” Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/meta-ai-boss-ai-lacks-intelligent-behavior-report?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Antpool CEO Andy Chow said:\""Antpool has become the bridge operator for Bitlayer to support Bitcoin innovation and protect miners’ interests.”BitVM (Bitcoin Virtual Machine) is a framework that enables complex smart contracts to be deployed on the Bitcoin blockchain without changing the base protocol. The idea was introduced by Robin Linux in 2023, and allows for the complex computation involved in smart contract systems to be verified onchain and executed offchain in a way resembling optimistic rollups.Related: Here’s how Bitcoin is transforming into Web3’s backboneA BitVM implementationBitlayer is a BitVM implementation, aiming to allow Bitcoin to flow through decentralized finance (DeFi) systems and layer-2 networks. According to Chow, the implementation might lead to heightened activity in Bitcoin’s network and generate revenue for miners:“This expansion of Bitcoin’s use cases will drive more network activity, generating additional transaction fees and revenue opportunities for miners. As block rewards decrease over time, growing fee markets are critical for miners’ sustainable income.“Mining pools such as Chow’s Antpool play a critical role in the adoption of BitVM implementations because they directly determine the inclusion and validation of new types of transactions and scripts at the consensus layer.BitVM requires miners to include custom Taproot-based transactions that encode interactive verification logic. Mining pools must agree to include these non-standard or computationally intensive scripts in blocks, otherwise the protocol would simply not function.Related: StarkWare researchers propose smart contracts for Bitcoin with ColliderVMMining pool supportAccording to Hashrate Index data, Antpool controls 17.2% of Bitcoin’s hashrate as of May 26, while F2Pool controls 8.2% and Spiderpool 6.1%. This results in a total supporting hashrate of  31.5%.Bitcoin hashrate distribution between mining pools. Source: Hash Rate IndexThis is enough to secure transaction inclusion in under one in every three blocks. This is presumably enough for testing, prototyping and early-stage applications.With this percentage of supporting hashrate, developers can build functional systems with the assumption that, despite some latency, BitVM transactions will be processed. So while it is hard to view this hashrate as allowing a fully functional deployment, it is likely enough for the early phases of BitVM development.A Bitlayer representative told Cointelegraph that “should collective hashrate support weaken or policy shifts occur within Bitcoin Core, we have a multi-layered contingency plan.” This plan includes the “expanded mining pool partnerships,” referring to the company’s intention to keep onboarding more mining pools.Magazine: ZK-proofs are bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin — BitcoinOS and Starknet",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitlayer-secures-40-of-bitcoin-s-hashrate-to-bring-smart-contracts-to-btc?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

European stock markets responded positively to the development, but Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to hold the $110,000 level, leading traders to question whether a new all-time high remains within reach.Even if Bitcoin revisits the $105,000 mark, rising institutional interest and robust derivatives markets indicate that bullish traders are neither overleveraged nor concerned about a potential correction.Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized basis rate. Source: laevitas.chDemand for leveraged long Bitcoin positions grew, as evidenced by the BTC futures premium increasing to 8% on May 26. Although this was a modest rise from 6.5% the previous day, the metric still sits comfortably within the neutral range of 5% to 10%. For context, in December 2024, the Bitcoin futures premium surged to 20% when BTC surpassed $100,000 for the first time.Will Nvidia earnings and US economic data ignite Bitcoin price? President Trump’s decision to delay the EU import duties until July 9 reduced some market uncertainty, yet the broader economic consequences of the ongoing tariff conflict have yet to show up in corporate earnings. Investor risk appetite now hinges in part on Nvidia's (NVDA)  May 28 earnings report, and anticipation for this possibly explains Bitcoin’s inability to break through its previous highs.Bitcoin options markets are signaling an increased probability of upward movement. This suggests that whales and market makers remain confident, even with BTC trading just 2.6% below its record high of $111,957.Bitcoin options 30-day delta skew (put-call) at Deribit.

Michael Saylor’s firm, Strategy, acquired $427 million worth of Bitcoin between May 19 and May 25, at an average price of $106,237. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw another $2.75 billion in inflows during the same period.During JPMorgan’s Annual Investor Day on May 19, CEO Jamie Dimon announced that the bank would finally allow clients to purchase spot Bitcoin ETFs. While the move does not include custody or official recommendations of cryptocurrencies, it opens the door to indirect Bitcoin exposure for the bank’s $6 trillion in customer deposits.Related: Bitcoin’s new highs may have been driven by Japan bond market crisisUS markets are closed on May 26 in observance of the Memorial Day holiday. As a result, any optimism stemming from the delayed US–EU tariffs may be tempered by ongoing concerns surrounding US government debt and the threat of a potential economic recession. The recent 5.1% drop in MBA Mortgage Applications for the week ending May 23 prompted traders to adopt a more cautious stance.While Bitcoin derivatives metrics remain healthy, upcoming economic data will be critical for market sentiment. Investors are closely watching the Richmond Fed manufacturing index due on May 28, followed by the PCE inflation data on May 30.
