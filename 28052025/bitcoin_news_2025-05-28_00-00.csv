2025-05-27T21:52:14.000Z,"Growing BTC reserve requires Congressional legislation — VanEck exec","Building a permanent US strategic Bitcoin reserve would likely require targeted legislation rather than executive action, according to VanEck’s head of digital assets, Matthew Sigel. Speaking at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, Sigel said the most viable path forward may involve inserting Bitcoin mining incentives into the congressional budget reconciliation process. According to Sigel, the most effective path to growing a US strategic Bitcoin reserve would be through targeted amendments to congressional budget legislation. These could include tax credits for mining companies that use methane gas and other incentives aimed at encouraging miners to share a portion of their mined BTC with the federal government. He argued that such an approach would allow the reserve to grow organically over time. Sigel also highlighted the limitations of executive actions in achieving this goal: \""The problem with executive action is that it's going to prompt lawsuits. And anything over $100 million is going to get sued by the Elizabeth Warrens of the world. So, I would say start with something maybe in the Exchange Stabilization Fund for $100 million.\"" US President Donald Trump established the US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve through a March 7 executive order. According to the order, the US government can only acquire Bitcoin through budget-neutral strategies or asset forfeiture, prompting a range of different ideas on how to add to the government’s stockpile of nearly 200,000 BTC.

Converting gold to Bitcoin would allow the US government to purchase more Bitcoin without incurring a cost to the taxpayer, Lummis said. Bo Hines, the executive director of the President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, echoed the idea in March 2025. Hines called on the US Treasury to revalue its gold holdings , which are currently priced at just $42.22 per troy ounce, and convert a portion of those gains to Bitcoin. This strategy would also be budget-neutral, Hines said. The price of gold reached an all-time high of $3,500 per ounce in April but experienced a minor pullback to around $3,300 on May 27.

Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, Lummis said she is bringing the BITCOIN ACT to the “attention of the American people and the world,” adding that, “President Trump supports the bill.” In March, Lummis reintroduced the BITCOIN Act — landmark legislation that directs the US government to acquire 1 million Bitcoin ( BTC ) over five years. The acquisitions would be financed using existing funds within the Federal Reserve System and the Treasury Department. As Cointelegraph reported , the Trump administration has reiterated the need to use “budget-neutral ways” to acquire Bitcoin without burdening taxpayers.

In a recent interview with Bitcoin financial services firm Unchained, Back said the odds are stacked against traders trying to time the market. Back came to this conclusion in the early days of Bitcoin, he said, when the price “was going up basically exponentially but it [was] extremely volatile.” “So [...] if you see something that’s going up exponentially but with volatility, if you sell it to time the market a bit falling, the odds are against you,” Back said, adding: “The trend line is up and to the right, exponential, and so there’s extremely bad trading odds attached to selling because you’re really hoping that it falls.” Adam Back during the interview.

It has seen multiple corrections above 80%, which may test the stomach of many investors and believers. However, those who have remained steady through the ups and downs have been rewarded: In the last 10 years, BTC has had a total return of over 39,000%. “I think anything that has a really rapid growth curve ends up with some pretty extreme volatility until it gets closer to full adoption,” Back said.

2025-05-27T21:11:46.000Z,"BlackRock Warning Corroborates Ripple CTO On Why Quantum Computing Is a Threat to Bitcoin","In a major development that has stirred debate across the crypto landscape, investment giant BlackRock has issued a stark warning about the long-term threat quantum computing poses to Bitcoin. This warning, highlighted by Digital Assets Daily, echoes concerns voiced years ago by David Schwartz, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer and one of the original architects behind Bitcoin’s foundational cryptographic ideas. Schwartz has consistently emphasized that while Bitcoin remains highly vulnerable to advances in quantum computing, XRP was deliberately designed with quantum-resistant features to mitigate these risks. BlackRock issues warning Quantum computing is a threat to Bitcoin. David Schwartz who worked on Bitcoin is the ‘Ripple’ CTO explained this years ago and explained how XRP is quantum proof….. https://t.co/mxlcuVaPop — Digital Assets Daily (@AssetsDaily) May 27, 2025 This convergence of perspectives from Wall Street’s largest institutional player and one of crypto’s most respected technologists has reignited urgent conversations about the future-proofing of blockchain assets in an era of rapid technological change. BlackRock’s Quantum Alarm: A Reality Check for Bitcoin BlackRock’s warning did not emerge in a vacuum. As quantum computing research accelerates, scientists are increasingly confident that quantum systems could, within the next decade, break the elliptic curve digital signature algorithms (ECDSA) that secure most blockchains today, including Bitcoin. These algorithms underpin the private-public key infrastructure that ensures only legitimate holders can spend their coins. While the timeline for quantum breakthroughs remains debated, BlackRock’s intervention signals that institutional investors are no longer viewing quantum risk as a distant hypothetical but as a real, looming threat. This concern is particularly relevant as Bitcoin continues to mature into a mainstream store of value, with trillions of dollars potentially at stake if its foundational security mechanisms are rendered obsolete. David Schwartz’s Early Warnings and XRP’s Quantum Resilience Long before BlackRock’s assessment, David Schwartz was already raising the alarm. As one of the original contributors to Bitcoin’s early code and cryptographic foundations, Schwartz has a unique vantage point on the technology’s inherent strengths and weaknesses. When he transitioned to his role at Ripple, Schwartz became an outspoken advocate for building blockchain systems that could withstand the arrival of quantum computing. Schwartz has explained in public talks and interviews that XRP’s architecture was designed with quantum threats in mind. Unlike Bitcoin , which uses ECDSA exclusively, XRP’s ledger supports multiple signature algorithms, including those considered more resistant to quantum attacks, such as Ed25519. This flexibility allows XRP to adopt stronger quantum-resistant cryptographic methods without fundamentally overhauling the entire network, a critical advantage as the quantum horizon approaches. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Broader Industry Implications The BlackRock warning has reverberated across the crypto industry, sparking renewed interest in quantum-resistant blockchains and prompting questions about Bitcoin’s adaptability. Bitcoin developers have long acknowledged the risk, but upgrading Bitcoin’s cryptographic backbone is no small feat. Any major change would require broad community consensus and meticulous coordination to avoid fragmenting the network or introducing unforeseen vulnerabilities. In contrast, Ripple’s proactive approach exemplifies a broader design philosophy that prioritizes long-term adaptability. By building in cryptographic flexibility from the outset, Ripple positioned XRP as a digital asset better suited to evolve with technological advances. This architectural foresight may prove critical as the blockchain sector confronts challenges far beyond regulatory hurdles or market volatility. Preparing for a Quantum Future The fusion of BlackRock’s institutional credibility and Schwartz’s technical authority underscores a sobering truth: quantum computing is no longer a theoretical concern—it’s a ticking clock for blockchain security. While some developers argue that the industry has ample time to prepare, others warn that the window for seamless upgrades is narrowing. What’s clear is that investors, developers, and institutions alike must engage seriously with the quantum question. Assets like XRP, designed with quantum resilience in mind, may increasingly stand out in a crowded field where not all blockchains are equally prepared for the post-quantum era. As BlackRock’s warning gains traction, it corroborates years of technical foresight from Ripple’s leadership, bringing new urgency to a debate that could define the next era of digital finance. Whether Bitcoin can successfully pivot to quantum-resistant cryptography remains to be seen, but the conversation has unmistakably shifted: the future of blockchain security is quantum, and the time to prepare is now.

Alleged Kidnapper Faces Hefty Charges 33-year-old William Duplessie of Miami, FL, turned himself in to police on May 27 following Woeltz’s shocking arrest on Friday. According to reports, Duplessie and the one-time “Kentucky king of crypto” are facing charges of assault, kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment, and criminal possession of a firearm. https://twitter.com/TMZ/status/1927407076654870883 A bio on Kando.Tech lists Duplessie as the co-founder of the Switzerland-based Pangaea Digital Asset Fund, an organization that focuses on recovering distressed financial blockchain firms . Police claim Duplessie and Woeltz are business partners, though it is not immediately clear in what capacity. Italian Man Shocked, Threatened With Gun In NYC Crypto Crime The duo is believed to have kidnapped, tortured, and abused an unidentified Italian man in a bid to gain illicit access to his Bitcoin. Duplessie and Woeltz are said to have turned their backs on the 28-year-old foreign national shortly after he revealed his Bitcoin password, giving the victim just enough time to break free from captivity in the luxury Nolita apartment and flag down a nearby traffic officer for help. The man told police he was lured to New York City by the two men on May 6 before subsequently being bound, shocked, cut, threatened with a gun, and dangled over a ledge by the purported crypto captors . Reports indicate that the anonymous victim may have been a business partner of Duplessie and Woeltz, although this has not been confirmed.

2025-05-27T20:52:31.000Z,"US stock markets make a comeback after 4-day losing streak","US stock markets came roaring back on Tuesday, snapping a four-day slide after President Donald Trump postponed a massive 50% tariff on European imports. The S&P 500 gained 2.05% to close at 5,921.54, bringing relief to a market that had been under pressure since last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 740.58 points, or 1.78%, ending at 42,343.65. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 2.47% to 19,199.16, boosted by strong moves in major tech names like Tesla and Nvidia. The rally followed Trump’s announcement on Sunday that he had agreed to delay the proposed tariff until July 9. That decision came after a direct appeal from Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission. Trump had originally planned to roll out the 50% tariff on June 1, a move that had rattled investors. Tech climbs as Musk walks away from politics Tesla shares jumped by around 7% on Tuesday after CEO Elon Musk said he was stepping away from politics to focus more on running his companies. That headline alone drove a surge in risk appetite across the tech space. Investors piled into Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and Microsoft, pushing the Nasdaq to outperform the broader market. Outside tech, US Steel advanced by roughly 2% after reports emerged that Nippon Steel, based in Japan, is expected to finalize its $55 per share acquisition deal. The broader rally wasn’t limited to large caps either. More than 90% of stocks in the S&P 500 finished higher. Smaller companies also gained, with the Russell 2000 rising about 2.5%. Markets had been closed on Monday in observance of Memorial Day, but when trading resumed Tuesday, buying pressure overwhelmed selling across nearly every sector. The tone completely reversed after last week’s rough patch, where all three major indexes — Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq — had each lost more than 2%. On CNBC’s “Squawk Box”, Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council, said he expected to “see a few more deals even this week,” adding fuel to investor confidence. That followed the release of stronger-than-expected consumer confidence data for May, which lifted hopes for economic stability and more trade progress. Investors track earnings, watch for catalysts This week, investors are watching earnings reports to see if the rebound has legs. Okta was scheduled to report after the bell on Tuesday, while updates from Nvidia, Macy’s, and Costco are expected later in the week. FactSet reported that over 95% of S&P 500 companies have released earnings for this quarter, and nearly 78% of them exceeded expectations. But some analysts are staying cautious. In a note sent out Sunday, Adam Parker, founder of Trivariate Research, wrote: “Right now, it feels like no one has a strong conviction — bullish or bearish — about the stock market. Fundamentals might deteriorate from here.” He added that the bigger concern remains Washington’s trade relationship with China. “We tend to think, and many investors agree, that the only tariff-related conversation that really matters is what the US does with China,” Parker said. “Taking it all in, even if macro headwinds persist, there’s a growing view that S&P 500 earnings might end up being less impacted than many, including us, originally feared.” Not everyone’s waiting for signs. Dann Ryan, Managing Partner at Sincerus Advisory, said Tuesday’s sharp moves were a result of pent-up momentum. “It seems like the long holiday weekend only served to build up momentum for today’s whipsaw,” Ryan said. “The trade tensions that had flared have already been extinguished, yet again, and now they’ll include an express lane.” Outside the stock market, crypto investors had their own reason to celebrate. The crypto market cap has added about $1 trillion, a 42% increase since its April 8th low, and now sits near $3.4 trillion. That’s just 6% below its December 2024 peak. Stripping out Bitcoin, the market still rose by $319 billion, or 35%. Even so, it’s about $380 billion short of the November 2021 top and $381 billion under the 2024 record.

According to a recent announcement, Nasdaq has submitted a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list and trade shares of the proposed 21Shares Sui ETF. This filing initiates the regulatory review process. 21Shares Strategic Deal With Sui Network Meanwhile, this move follows 21Shares’ earlier filing to register the ETF , giving traditional investors access to SUI. Notably, the proposed ETF offers investors direct exposure to the price of SUI without owning the asset. A significant difference with this 21Shares ETF filing is that it does not plan to stake any portion of its holdings to earn yield. 21Shares has also decided to collaborate with the Lyer-1 network in a “strategic partnership.” The goal of the collaboration is to expand access globally and keep up with the growing crypto ecosystem. According to 21Shares President Duncan Moir, the collaboration will cover product partnerships, research reports, and other areas of interest. Moir highlighted the Sui ecosystem’s throughput, scalability, and speed. He noted that the network has made it appealing for real-world asset tokenization, decentralized finance (DeFi), and stablecoins. While filing for an SUI ETF is a step in a series of steps to actualizing it, the collaboration could positively impact SUI. It could also increase SUI’s adoption and utility for the ecosystem. 21Shares Files for Dogecoin ETF This is not the first time Nasdaq has filed for 21Shares. Recall that Nasdaq filed with the US SEC in April to list and trade the 21Shares Dogecoin ETF . Interestingly, Nasdaq’s S-1 form filing submitted to the SEC for the 21Shares Dogecoin ETF is a big step in the approval process. The SEC will review and publish the application in the Federal Register, after which the public will have a chance to share their opinions. Once that is done, the SEC will decide whether to approve or deny the ETF. However, this move follows a separate 19b-4 form that the asset manager filed that month. The form revealed the company’s interest in offering an ETF to allow institutional investors to buy Dogecoin without holding the token directly. The Crypto ETF Race Intensifies The pursuit of crypto ETFs has gained significant traction over the past years. Competition intensified after the SEC approved spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. In January 2024, the SEC approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs and greenlighted eight Ethereum ETFs. This development has prompted a flurry of applications for other cryptocurrencies. Firms like VanEck have applied for a Solana ETF, while 21Shares has joined the race for a spot XRP ETF alongside others like Canary Capital and Bitwise.

The model outlines two possible outcomes for Bitcoin in the near term, with one leaning more bullish than the other. On May 16, Weiss Crypto, a leading provider of crypto and stock ratings, reported that Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market cap, is on track to reach a new all-time high. According to the report, the Crypto Timing Model pointed to May 23 as a key date to watch out for. The model also indicated that Bitcoin was still in a bull market and that the 320-day cycle would likely continue in early July. Notably, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high on May 22 after successfully maintaining its position above $100,000 over the last two weeks. This morning, Bitcoin surpassed its previous high of $109,300 attained in January, to trade around the $109,500 price mark. The big bull continued its Thursday rally, hitting a fresh high of $111,886 shortly after. What is next for Bitcoin?

However, a mild price decline might be observed in the near term. “Our Crypto Timing Model indicated we were on the verge of a new all-time high, almost to the letter. Here’s what the model expects BTC to do next: A slight pullback either late this week or next. Then a clear path to $150k and possibly higher.” Weiss wrote.

According to the announcement, Trump Media entered into a subscription agreement with about 50 institutional investors in a bid to raise a total of $2.5 billion, The company highlighted that $1.5 billion will be raised through selling common stock, while the remaining $1 billion will be raised through 0 percent convertible senior secured notes. Trump Media plans to close the offering by May 29, 2025. “We view Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets. Our first acquisition of a crown jewel asset, this investment will help defend our Company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions, which plague many Americans and U.S. firms and will create synergies for subscription payments, a utility token, and other planned transactions across Truth Social and Truth+,” Trump Media’s CEO and Chairman Devin Nunes, noted . Market Impact of Trump Media’s Bitcoin Adoption The adoption of Bitcoin by Trump Media was in retrospect imminent, especially following the launch of the World Liberty Financial (WLFI). With the deal expected to close before the end of this week, Bitcoin price is well positioned to rally towards a new all-time high (ATH) in the near future.

2025-05-27T20:30:59.000Z,"XRP, DOGE Payments Coming to X? Elon Musk Announces Beta Version of X Money Will be Released Soon","Elon Musk , owner of social media platform X, confirmed that a beta version of X Money will be released soon, allowing X users to transact digital payments. There was much user speculation as to when X Money would be released. Musk is well known as the CEO of both Tesla and SpaceX. The digital payments launch complements Musk’s vision of turning X, formerly Twitter, into an ‘everything app’, hosting all sorts of digital services, including financial apps, alongside the original social media platform. An insider revealed that X was on the verge of releasing the X Money feature, which would allow payment transactions and banking tools. Musk confirmed the release of X Money, with the caveat that the new feature will have a limited beta rollout and will be released slowly because customer savings need to be taken. The release date is not yet known, but is suspected to be sometime in 2025. The payment services will most likely include Bitcoin and Visa, but crypto adherents believe we could also see an XRP and Dogecoin debut. Facebook Marketplace has provided financial services for some time, allowing users to buy and sell items from within the app. X Money is not the first social media platform to entertain the idea of embedding financial services. TikTok also has a rewards program for creators to earn money from creating videos. X Money, however, plans on making fast payments within the app, effectively replacing traditional banks. Further, Musk is often affiliated with crypto brands like Dogecoin . However, Musk had to abandon plans to allow Tesla cars to be purchased with crypto due to environmental concerns regarding proof-of-work algorithms. Visa announced earlier this year that they were the first payment service to collaborate with X Money. Visa users can send money directly to X Money from their accounts. X Money, however, has got competition, especially from Asian markets. WeChat, for example, already integrates payments into its social media app. Linda Yaccarino, X’s CEO, stated that X Money would most likely be released later in the year and include peer-to-peer functionality for Visa holders. X users would be able to send payments to other X users with ease. Musk has been talking about an ‘everything app’ for some time now. However, whether Musk will enable cryptocurrencies like XRP and Dogecoin on X Money. Musk has promoted Dogecoin and invested in a Bitcoin treasury with his company, Tesla . Trump tapped Musk to advise a government department called DOGE, which was an apparent reference to Dogecoin. Since Musk bought Twitter in 2022 and rebranded it as X, there has been speculation that he would convert it into a crypto payment app. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic Senator, has a more critical take on Musk’s X Money, suggesting that Musk is seeking to collect people’s financial data to make up for losing so much money on X. Warren also sees Musk as colluding with Trump to enrich himself and his company. Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion and immediately indicated he wished to transform the troubled social media platform into X, an everything app. Linda Yaccarino, X’s CEO, announced at the time that X would include multiple media formats, banking services, and unlimited interactivity. There has always been speculation that X would consist of Bitcoin transactions. However, X Money was expected to be launched in mid-2024, but this has been further delayed. However, Musk suggests that extra care had to be taken when dealing with users’ savings. President Trump took office in January and appointed Musk as the head of the DOGE department. The increased interaction between Musk and Trump may further empower X Money to endorse cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, XRP, and Dogecoin.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/xrp-doge-payments-coming-to-x-elon-musk-announces-beta-version-of-x-money-will-be-released-soon/,"BTC|DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Doge|Elon Musk|Twitter|XRP News",cryptocompare
2025-05-27T20:30:26.000Z,"Maple Finance, FalconX secure Bitcoin-backed loans from Cantor Fitzgerald — Report","Wall Street financial firm Cantor Fitzgerald has closed its first Bitcoin lending deal nearly a year after announcing its crypto lending services. According to a May 27 Bloomberg report, Cantor provided Bitcoin-backed loans to FalconX and Maple Finance. FalconX, a digital asset broker, said it secured a facility worth over $100 million as part of a “broader credit framework,” while Maple Finance reportedly closed the first tranche of an agreement with Cantor. The service allows companies holding Bitcoin to borrow funds and use the cryptocurrency as collateral, providing a way to unlock liquidity without selling their BTC holdings. Cantor announced its Bitcoin financing business with an initial capital of $2 billion in July 2024, targeting institutional investors seeking to leverage their Bitcoin. At the time, the company said Anchorage Digital and Copper would serve as custodians and collateral managers in the venture. Credit markets are a fundamental part of the financial system, allowing capital to flow between borrowers and lenders and supporting economic activity across sectors. Their central role also means they can contribute to financial distress when risks are mismanaged. While mirroring some functions of traditional finance, crypto credit markets have been operating with less regulatory oversight. Digital asset crisis of 2022 This dynamic was evident during the 2022 crisis in the digital asset sector. Celsius Network, once a leading crypto lending platform, collapsed after engaging in risky financial practices and facing allegations of fraud. Similarly, BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2022 following significant exposure to the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. According to a report from Galaxy, the total crypto lending market, including crypto-backed collateralized debt positions (CDPs) tied to stablecoins, stood at $36.5 billion in the last quarter of 2024, marking a 43% decline from its all-time high of $64.4 billion in 2021. Despite the broader contraction, onchain lending platforms have seen a dramatic rebound, with open borrowed positions surging to $19.1 billion by Q4 2024, a 959% increase over two years. Crypto lending markets remain well below their Q1 2022 peak. Source: Galaxy Cantor’s crypto arm Cantor is one of the most traditional financial services companies in the United States. Founded in 1945, it offers a range of services for institutions, including investment banking, brokerage, equity and fixed-income sales and trading. The company claims to serve over 5,000 clients across 20 countries. The company’s CEO, Howard Lutnick, has been an advocate for classifying Bitcoin as a commodity, akin to gold and oil, and has called for clearer regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies in the US. Lutnick was also appointed to co-lead US President Donald Trump’s transition team in 2024. Cantor is also one of the managers of Tether’s US Treasury securities portfolio backing its stablecoin. In early 2024, the firm acquired a 5% stake in Tether.

By examining derivatives trading data from the past four years, the company identified price zones where Bitcoin showed low trading volume and weak trading activity. It was noted that these zones could be retested in the coming months. According to Alphractal’s analysis, Bitcoin has historically traded sparsely at $99,000, $89,000, $81,000, $77,000, and $74,000. Such low-volume zones coincide with periods of rapid price movement or weak investor interest. The firm said these gaps are typically retested within a year. Related News: Bitcoin's Mega Rally Has Stalled: What's Next? What Are the Key Levels? On the other hand, it is observed that US-based investors have returned to the market strongly. Alphractal stated that during Bitcoin's recent rise, the Coinbase Premium Index has moved back into positive territory. This index measures the price difference between Coinbase and other major exchanges. A positive index indicates that buying pressure is increasing in the US market and means that Bitcoin is trading at a premium to Coinbase. Alphractal stated that this development particularly reflects the optimism of institutional investors and capital inflows originating from the US.

CZ recently shared a message with the phrase, “Probably sold Bitcoin,” and added a laughing emoji at the end of his message. It is not known exactly who the Binance founder targeted with this mysterious statement, but there are some guesses among the cryptocurrency community. One of the biggest BTC bulls, MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor, said in a statement today that there is no need for interventions such as Proof of Reserves and audits for companies holding Bitcoin and that these create security vulnerabilities. Related News: New Development Regarding Ripple's Alleged Historic Acquisition Deal: Company Issues Statement Saylor, who received a huge backlash for this statement, may be the person CZ claims sold Bitcoin to. According to proponents of this theory, Saylor is not keen on measures such as Proof of Reserves because he sold Bitcoin. There is no official information that Saylor has sold BTC, and there is no information in recent SEC filings that they have sold BTC. However, purchases and sales that are not included in periodically filed SEC documents can be identified as onchain.

2025-05-27T20:05:03.000Z,"Trump’s Tariff Threats Have Derailed Bitcoin’s Bullish Momentum: Santiment","Bitcoin’s record-breaking rally last week collided headfirst with geopolitical turbulence, as U.S. President Donald Trump returned to making tariff threats, this time aimed at the European Union (EU). The move injected volatility into a market fresh off its all-time high (ATH) after BTC came within a couple of hundred bucks of flying past $112,000. It has since wobbled, trading sideways around $109,500 as traders weigh the implications of escalating U.S.-EU trade tensions. Tariff Whiplash In early April, the price of BTC dropped to about $82,000 after Trump announced a raft of tariff measures impacting multiple U.S. trade partners. The president claimed the new taxes were needed to correct deficits between the United States and other countries. At the time, the EU was hit with a 20% tax on exports to the U.S. Days later, Trump was at it again, hiking levies against Chinese imports to 104% . His actions pushed BTC prices even lower, with the cryptocurrency dipping to $74,600 and wrecking crypto trades worth more than $287 million. However, after about 24 hours, the White House announced that more than 75 countries had contacted the U.S. for tariff negotiations, prompting Trump to lower the taxes to 10%, although products from China suffered an increase to 125%. The good news gave Bitcoin a leg up to around $82,000 from around $77,000. As the first week of May closed, news emerged that the U.S. and China were planning high-level trade talks to iron out their differences. The reports stirred BTC into action, helping push it past $97,000 from a low of $94,000. Soon after, it went past $100,000, buoyed by easing geopolitical tensions, exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, and increased institutional demand. On May 22, the king cryptocurrency recorded a new ATH, with market watchers expecting it to move on to the next milestone quickly. However, once again, Trump threw a spanner in the works, announcing a 50% tariff on EU goods on May 23 due to stalled negotiations. BTC promptly tumbled 4% to $107,500, dragging altcoins like Monero (XMR) and Hyperliquid (HYPE) down 5.5% and 3.5%, respectively. Social media sentiment, tracked by analytics firm Santiment, mirrored the panic, with retail traders fleeing altcoins and “tariff” mentions spiking 300%, the largest surge since April’s market correction. Yet the selloff proved short-lived. By May 25, the American president paused the tariffs, citing ongoing talks. BTC responded soon after, clawing back to $109,500 per CoinGecko data. July 9: The Next Inflection Point Santiment said in a May 27 blog post that this “threat-then-delay” tactic, a hallmark of Trump’s trade strategy, has kept markets oscillating between fear and cautious optimism. For investors in crypto, where volatility is already baked into the landscape, this adds another layer of unpredictability,” noted analyst BrianQ “It’s hard to deny that digital assets are way more intertwined with global macro trends than they were a decade ago, back when crypto felt like a true free-for-all.” With the next tariff decision now delayed until July 9, Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory is hostage to geopolitics. If Trump proceeds, the fallout could cascade across equities, currencies, and yes, crypto. Until then, digital asset traders are caught between technical optimism and political unpredictability.

2025-05-27T20:00:00.000Z,"The Last Wealth Secret: Why Financial Advisors Are Quietly Accumulating Bitcoin Solaris Instead of Following Dogecoin News","Dogecoin’s viral success and meme-fueled rallies have drawn millions of retail investors into the crypto space. Its media-friendly narrative and celebrity endorsements helped push it to top-tier status — but its core mechanics remain unchanged. Dogecoin offers no smart contract capabilities, no native yield, and no supply cap. As a result, serious financial professionals are increasingly viewing it as a speculative tool, not a vehicle for sustainable wealth. In contrast, Bitcoin Solaris has begun attracting quiet accumulation from financial advisors and portfolio strategists seeking real utility, fixed tokenomics, and protocol-level access. With its mobile-native mining model and decentralized daily earnings, BTC-S is now being recognized as one of the few under-the-radar opportunities with real fundamentals and growth architecture. From Speculation to Participation: A Shift in Strategy Bitcoin Solaris introduces Nova App, a mobile mining platform that transforms smartphones into income-generating assets. Users allocate 1–5 GB of storage and background CPU power, typically while the phone charges, and receive BTC-S tokens based on uptime. No staking, technical skills, or third-party platforms are required. This model appeals to financial professionals because it represents predictable, participation-based earnings rather than sentiment-driven performance. Unlike Dogecoin, which offers exposure to price movement alone, Bitcoin Solaris gives users the ability to earn directly from decentralized infrastructure — turning clients into contributors, not just holders. Technology That Scales with Adoption, Not Hype Bitcoin Solaris is built on a dual-layer blockchain designed for high throughput and broad accessibility. The Base Layersecures the network using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and Proof-of-Capacity (PoC), while the Solaris Layer handles contract execution and mining logic via Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Time (PoT). This architecture enables over 10,000 TPS with 2-second finality, ensuring the network can support thousands of mobile miners simultaneously. This system allows Bitcoin Solaris to function as both a high-performance blockchain and a passive income protocol — without congestion, bottlenecks, or reliance on Layer 2 patches. For institutional advisors and high-net-worth planners, that means scalability and long-term viability without speculative dependency. Audited and Verified for User Confidence Bitcoin Solaris has undergone extensive third-party auditing and governance verification. The Cyberscope audit reviewed contract logic and emission structure. The Freshcoins audit validated mobile mining at scale. KYC verification was also completed to ensure transparent governance and compliance alignment. These security layers are a prerequisite for advisors recommending digital assets in structured portfolios — especially those with client exposure mandates. Early Entry Offers Direct Protocol Exposure Bitcoin Solaris is now in Presale Phase 5, priced at 5 USDT per BTC-S token. The listing price is set for 20 USDT, with no future token creation beyond the fixed 21 million supply. Of that, 4.2 million tokens (20%) are allocated to presale participants. Unlike Dogecoin, which has an uncapped supply and no formal distribution model, Bitcoin Solaris offers a defined economic entry point — one that grants both price access and early mining participation before the Nova App goes live and user difficulty increases. In a new segment, Crypto Nitro highlighted the divergence between meme-driven assets and blockchain projects with reward logic. He outlines how Bitcoin Solaris’s fixed-supply model and Nova App structure make it a long-term holding for professionals and early-stage investors alike. Dogecoin helped bring attention to crypto — but attention alone doesn’t create wealth. Bitcoin Solaris offers what Dogecoin never did: structured tokenomics, real utility, and consistent user rewards. For long-term investors, the opportunity is clear — and it’s happening before the headlines.

In a new filing with the Office of the Maine Attorney General, the City of Sheboygan, Wisconsin, says it discovered a serious breach affecting 67,947 Americans. The law firm representing the Sheboygan city government, Constangy, Brooks, Smith and Prophete, LLP, says that “data stored on a segment of the city’s network may have been accessed or acquired without authorization.” The law firm says that a city investigation revealed individuals’ personal information may have been stolen, including names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, license plate or vehicle ID numbers, and drivers’ license or state ID numbers. “On October 31, 2024, the city experienced an encryption event that resulted in a network disruption. Upon discovering the incident, it swiftly took steps to secure its digital environment. It also engaged a digital forensics and incident response firm to conduct an investigation to determine whether any data may have been affected… Following a comprehensive and thorough review of the data involved, the city learned on May 14, 2025, that certain individuals’ personal information was affected by this incident.” The law firm says letters of notification were sent to those affected to inform them about the data breach, while offering free identity protection services to victims whose Social Security numbers were stolen. For now, the law firm says the Sheboygan city government is currently implementing enhanced security protocols to mitigate the risk of another data breach.

According to a new Bloomberg report, PME says US money managers are allegedly risking significant business by “caving into pressures” from President Donald Trump’s administration by abandoning basic principles of responsible investing. Says Daan Spaargaren, PME’s senior strategist for responsible investing, “[US money managers] aren’t condemning what Trump is doing and how he is operating and how he is handling issues like climate change and demolishing the judiciary. We are worried about that.” The PME warns America’s investment industry that a Trump capitulation is prompting it to think twice about its US investments. The PME is reconsidering its $5.7 billion mandate with BlackRock Inc., after the world’s largest asset manager withdrew from the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative. A decision from PME is expected within weeks. Spaargaren says Trump’s actions that are raising concerns include attacking judges, countering America’s move to cleaner energies and the removal of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies. “[If asset managers] align their interests and their policies with the current administration in the US, then we are legitimizing also these steps and these practices by offering them our funds.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-05-27T19:43:07.000Z,"Bitcoin faces key support test at $108k amid $211m in liquidations: analysts","Bitunix analysts have highlighted the latest data on crypto liquidations near the $108,000 support zone, warning that more liquidations could follow if Bitcoin breaks below this level. Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent volatility has created a notable liquidation pocket, analysts at crypto exchange Bitunix told crypto.news. On Tuesday, May 27, total crypto liquidations reached $211 million, with a clear bias toward long positions. Specifically, $131 million in longs were liquidated, compared to $79.84 million in short positions. Bitunix analysts interpret this imbalance as evidence of a long-side wipeout during Bitcoin’s recent dip to $108,000. As a result, they caution against entering overly aggressive long positions while BTC trades near this key support. “Short-term attention should be paid to the effect of support at $108,500–$109,000, and it is not recommended to chase higher. Analysts advise observing whether the $110,800–$112,000 pressure band is effectively broken before considering further positions,” Bitunix wrote.

2025-05-27T19:33:18.000Z,"Third Arrest Made in Manhattan Bitcoin Kidnapping, Torture Case","A man suspected of helping kidnap and torture an Italian cryptocurrency investor in a Manhattan townhouse has surrendered to New York City police. William Duplessie turned himself in Tuesday after what officials described as days of negotiations with authorities, the New York Times reports. He is the third suspect in an alleged plot to extract the keys to a bitcoin wallet belonging to Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan, a crypto fund associate who said he was held captive and abused for nearly three weeks. The ordeal began on May 6, when Carturan arrived at a 17-room townhouse on Prince Street in Manhattan’s NoLiTa neighborhood. He was set to reconnect with former fund partner John Woeltz, who, along with another associate Beatrice Folchi, allegedly ambushed him. Police say the group attempted to force Carturan to surrender access to his crypto holdings, reportedly worth millions, through physical threats and psychological abuse. According to law enforcement, Carturan was assaulted, suspended from the top floor of the five-story building, and held at gunpoint. He managed to escape and alert authorities nearly three weeks later. The New York City Police Department case has drawn attention for its brutality and connection to a growing trend of physical attacks on crypto users. In France, the daughter and grandson of Paymium CEO Pierre Noizat were recently targeted in a failed kidnapping attempt captured on video . Earlier in the same city, a crypto millionaire’s father was abducted and had a finger severed before being rescued. Another incident saw David Balland, co-founder of hardware wallet maker Ledger, and his wife kidnapped from their home. Authorities later rescued the couple and seized the ransom payment.

2025-05-27T19:31:00.000Z,"Is a Massive XRP Move Coming? Futures Say Yes, Charts Say “Any Minute Now” (XRP Price Prediction)","XRP (XRP) has dipped by 1% over the past week, consolidating below $2.60 — but rising futures activity could change that soon, raising bullish XRP price prediction hopes. Trading volumes in the past 24 hours have gone up slightly by 8.4% and currently stand at $2.2 billion as Bitcoin (BTC) seems determined to retest its latest all-time high of nearly $112,000. Even though the token’s price action has been relatively calm, the futures market has been quite active, according to data from CoinGlass . Open interest in XRP futures across top exchanges have increased since May 7 from $3.6 billion to $4.8 billion – a 29.7% increase in less than a month. However, during this period, the price has gone up by just 8.5% from $2.13 to $2.31. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Could Drop to $2 Before Rising to a New All-Time High XRP’s daily chart shows that the price has broken its bullish structure and has already retested this former support from below. This is a bearish indication in the near term but not necessarily a sign of an impending collapse as the market needs to raise liquidity for the next leg up. The 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) seems like the most plausible landing zone for XRP as it coincides with a key psychological level at $2 per token. It is highly likely that bears will push the price to this threshold to unlock additional liquidity in the next few days to catalyze a pronounced move. In bull markets, short squeezes tend to be one of the most effective ways to propel the price of an asset higher. Hence, a break below $2 could be what the token needs to recapture buyers’ interest and support a bullish XRP price prediction to $3 at least. Patient investors and traders will benefit the most if they wait for the best entry, which is probably the $2 level. In the mean time, as Bitcoin reaches $110,000, the first milestone of a crypto presale called BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) could soon be hit and, with it, an attractive reward for token holders will be unlocked. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) Pays Out Bitcoin to Holders BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) is an innovative meme coin presale that introduces a reward mechanism tied to the performance of the top crypto – Bitcoin. Rewards are distributed to token holders every time that BTC reaches a new price milestone, the first of which sits at $125,000. Once the price gets to that level, a portion of BTCBULL’s circulating supply will be burned. This will foster scarcity and should result in an immediate uptick in its price. Next up, once the price reaches $125K, token holders will receive a direct airdrop of Bitcoin tokens. This system repeats every time that BTC adds $25,000 more to its price, starting at a baseline of $100K. To start earning passive income through BTCBULL, head to the BTC Bull Token website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ).

2025-05-27T19:20:36.000Z,"Bitcoin price held up by corporate adoption and ‘inflation hedge’ narratives","Key takeaways: Institutional investor demand and corporate adoption may push Bitcoin higher despite recession fears. Investors’ belief that the US Federal Reserve will hold rates favors Bitcoin price upside. Stock markets around the world responded positively to the temporary suspension of import tariffs between the United States and the European Union, with the S&P 500 rising 1.5% on May 27. However, concerns over a global economic recession persist, capping Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) upside, especially since the baseline US import rates have been raised for most regions. Bitcoin remains antifragile and poised to outperform in uncertain times Given the growing investor uncertainty about economic conditions, Bitcoin hovering around the $110,000 level has taken investors by surprise as it consolidates the top-6 position as a global tradable asset by market capitalization. Investors now ask whether Bitcoin is becoming antifragile or if a drop below $100,000 is inevitable in a recessionary environment. Traders currently estimate a 41% chance that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will maintain interest rates through September, a steep rise from just 2% one month ago. CME FEDWatch target rate probabilities. Source: CME Normally, a higher cost for capital is bearish for risk-on assets like Bitcoin. However, in this context, it also suggests potential liquidity injections from the Fed, given the unfavorable US fiscal outlook , where government spending exceeds revenue capacity. US President Donald Trump has called for lower interest rates, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell remains cautious due to a strong labor market and rising inflation pressures, whether driven by tariffs or easy credit conditions. This tension helps explain why the S&P 500 has struggled to retake its February all-time high of 6,147 and why Bitcoin’s upside has also been limited. Bitcoin’s current market capitalization of $2.2 trillion now exceeds that of Google and Meta, which partially explains the $112,000 resistance level. Still, it would be inaccurate to suggest Bitcoin has decoupled from traditional markets; its 30-day correlation with the S&P 500 has remained above 70% over the past four weeks. As such, if equities enter a bear market, Bitcoin is likely to face downside as well. 30-day correlation: Bitcoin/USD vs. S&P 500 futures. Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph Companies are currently reporting earnings for the first quarter, a period that predates the escalation of the trade war. As a result, the stock market may take longer to reflect the full negative impact, even as macroeconomic indicators show signs of contraction. The 6.3% drop in US durable goods orders in April, reported on May 27, could be the first signal of a weakening economy. US durable goods–new orders for April. Source: US Census Bureau However, even if corporate earnings for the first quarter fall short of expectations, this does not automatically mean the S&P 500 will suffer significantly. In fact, disappointing results could open the door for faster interest rate cuts, which tend to benefit companies by lowering financing costs and potentially stimulating consumer demand. Bitcoin's appeal as a strategic asset grows, Trump Media joins the party Bitcoin’s risk profile appears to have improved after Trump Media and Technology Group announced plans to acquire BTC following a $2.5 billion mix of debt and equity financing. “We view Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom,” Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said, according to Reuters. This development suggests that Bitcoin’s trajectory toward $112,000 is not solely tied to broader economic growth. Related: Bitcoin stalls at $110K but institutional investors continue gobbling up BTC The growing institutional and corporate interest in Bitcoin adds a new dimension to its market behavior. While macroeconomic trends and correlations with traditional assets still matter, Bitcoin is increasingly being framed as a strategic asset with utility beyond speculation. As such, its performance could diverge, at least partially, from that of equities, especially as adoption broadens among influential companies and investors. While the stock market may remain sensitive to macro data and earnings surprises, Bitcoin’s upside potential appears to rest on a mix of monetary policy, institutional positioning, and its emerging role as a hedge against systemic financial risk.

KindlyMD’s move to buy 21 Bitcoin ( BTC ) comes a few weeks after David Bailey, the chief executive officer of BTC Inc., and crypto advisor of U.S. president Donald Trump, announced the launch of Nakamoto Holdings.

Funds came from gross proceeds of $8.7 million raised through recent warrant exercises. “KindlyMD chose 21 BTC, which is one millionth of the total supply of bitcoin, as a symbolic first step on our journey to be the leading Bitcoin treasury strategy,” Bailey said. “There are many more milestones ahead and we can’t wait to continue to execute our roadmap with KindlyMD.” You might also like: Strive announces $750m private investment to buy Bitcoin Nakamoto Holdings’ launch followed Bailey’s $300 million raise in equity and convertible debt earlier this year.

2025-05-27T19:15:17.000Z,"Bitcoin’s Mega Rally Has Stalled: What’s Next? What Are the Key Levels?","Cryptocurrency analysis company MakroVision stated in its latest technical analysis report that Bitcoin continues its upward trend. The report stated that the leading cryptocurrency broke the $ 102,000 resistance and then surpassed the first extension target at $ 107,365. According to the analysis, Bitcoin is currently moving towards a new liquidity zone at around $ 112,500. MakroVision states that this rise is technically healthy and has a controlled structure. According to the analysis, the rally that started above $ 102,000 has an impulsive structure, while the pullbacks have been short-lived and limited so far. This shows that the market is still driven by buyers and the upward dynamics continue strongly. Related News: Google Publishes Scientific Paper That Could Change What We Know About Bitcoin: “20 Times Easier to Break Than Previously Thought” The first significant resistance level against Bitcoin stands out as $111,200. This level is notable because it is both a Fibonacci 0.618 extension point and a region of intense liquidity. If this level is broken to the upside, analysts consider $121,100 as the next target. This point is seen as a 1.236 extension target on the larger time frame. On the other hand, some critical support levels that investors should follow in case of a possible pullback were also included in the analysis. While it is stated that $ 107,365 works as support in the short term, the $ 106,455 level stands out as a stronger and strategic support area. It is also stated that as long as it remains above $ 102,000, the general technical structure is not disrupted and the upward momentum continues.

2025-05-27T19:00:02.000Z,"Bitcoin Supply Concentrates In Experienced Hands – LTHs Show No Signs Of Distribution","Bitcoin is consolidating just below its all-time high near $112,000, maintaining a bullish structure as momentum builds across the broader crypto market. After a strong rally in recent weeks, BTC is showing signs of strength and stability, trading in a tight range that many analysts view as a launchpad for the next major move. The setup points to further upside, with growing confidence that Bitcoin could break into new highs soon. Analysts are increasingly optimistic, calling for an expansive summer as capital begins to flow back into crypto markets. Both technical resilience and compelling on-chain data are fueling the sentiment shift. According to insights from Alphractal, long-term holders (LTHs)—those holding BTC for more than six months—continue to accumulate but not distribute. In fact, the supply held by LTHs is steadily increasing, a sign of deep conviction and reduced liquid supply in the market. This behavior from experienced holders reinforces the bullish thesis: when LTHs are not selling into strength, it often sets the foundation for sustainable rallies . With a strong technical base, rising institutional interest, and long-term holders tightening supply, Bitcoin appears primed for a powerful summer ahead. Bitcoin Consolidates As Market Dynamics Shift Bitcoin is currently consolidating just below the $110,000 level, holding steady after an aggressive rally that brought it close to its all-time high of $112K. Despite the pause in upside momentum, bulls remain firmly in control. Both the daily and weekly charts show a well-defined uptrend structure, with higher highs and higher lows continuing to build. The consolidation appears to be a healthy cooldown before the next major move. Top analyst Darkfost recently shared insights into the market’s underlying structure, focusing on the behavior of Long-Term Holders (LTHs) and Short-Term Holders (STHs). According to Darkfost, LTHs are not distributing their coins—in fact, they are doing the opposite. The supply held by LTHs is steadily increasing, signaling conviction and reinforcing the idea that seasoned investors expect more upside. Interestingly, the behavior of STHs paints a very different picture. Darkfost expressed surprise at the data, which shows that STHs are actively distributing. Unlike past instances where STH selling occurred during corrections, this time the selling is taking place at an all-time high. It suggests a possible transfer from strong hands (LTHs) to weaker hands (STHs), a dynamic that often precedes increased volatility. While STHs may be locking in profits at the top, Darkfost notes it’s hard to say they’re wrong—after all, BTC is at an ATH, not in a mid-cycle dip. Still, with LTHs continuing to hold and reduce available supply, the broader trend remains bullish. The coming days could define whether BTC reclaims $112K and enters price discovery or retreats under growing short-term pressure. Price Action Details: Key Levels To Watch Bitcoin is currently trading at $109,863 on the daily chart, holding firm just below its all-time high of $112,000. Price action remains bullish, with BTC consolidating in a tight range after a powerful breakout above the $103,600 resistance zone, now acting as a key support level. This consolidation appears healthy and controlled, as buyers continue to defend higher lows. The 34-day EMA sits at $101,928 and is rising steadily, confirming strong short- to mid-term momentum. BTC is also comfortably above the 50, 100, and 200-day SMAs, all of which are now aligned to the upside—a classic signal of trend strength. Volume has slightly decreased during this phase, which is typical for consolidation after a breakout. This price behavior suggests bulls are not exhausted but rather preparing for the next leg up. A daily close above $112K with volume confirmation would likely push BTC into price discovery, with potential upside targets around $120K to $125K. Until then, the $103,600–$105,000 zone remains the critical area to hold. As long as BTC stays above this region and maintains its higher structure, the broader uptrend remains intact, and the bullish outlook is unchanged.

The company intends to either tap into the common shares, warrants, subscription receipts, units, debt securities, or a combination to raise the funds. Through leveraging the capital markets, SOL Strategies plans to invest more in the Solana network ahead. “The filing of a base shelf prospectus supports our growth strategy by providing us with the flexibility to access capital as future opportunities arise in the rapidly evolving Solana ecosystem. This strategic move enhances our ability to act decisively when compelling investment opportunities present themselves,” Leah Wald, CEO of SOL Strategies, noted . As Coinpedia previously reported , SOL Strategies has strengthened its balance sheet through Solana acquisitions in the past. As of this writing, the company held about 389,675 SOL coins, with the majority acquired YTD. Impact of SOL Strategies Plan on Solana Price The relentless support of the Solana network from SOL Strategies has played a crucial role in the altcoin’s bullish sentiment. Furthermore, on-chain data shows that the Solana network has a significantly higher number of users compared to its direct competitors such as Ethereum (ETH), and Tron (TRX), among others. As Bitcoin (BTC) price teases a rally towards a new all-time high (ATH) in the near future, SOL price has attracted more whale investors and FOMO traders. Moreover, the notable adoption of the Solana-based memecoins in the recent past has helped increase the overall SOL utility. From a technical analysis standpoint, the SOL price is well positioned for a rally beyond $200 in the coming days following a notable bullish momentum in the past two months.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/sol-strategies-files-preliminary-base-shelf-prospectus-to-raise-1b-to-buy-solana/,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|SOL|TRADING","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare

Over time, telecom companies have invested a lot of energy into providing connectivity without in-depth consideration of how to promote loyal customer engagements—until today. Telecom token RZTO , a Solana-based utility token, has partnered with Rizz Wireless, an FCC-licensed MVNO in the USA, to create a crypto-integrated model that revolutionizes telecom rewards. This token with rewards is now live with a full suite of mobile rewards and real staking benefits, plus premium travel packages, set to emerge as a superlative offering for users. Imagine gathering digital rewards from your day-to-day calls, using them for quicker returns, cashing them in for travel rewards, while enjoying 5G nationwide coverage. This isn’t a futuristic concept; it’s happening now. RZTO and Rizz Wireless are remaking the telecom market with a model that transforms customer loyalty into a valuable benefit and into more money. How RZTO Powers Rizz Wireless Notably, RZTO has a foundational role in driving Rizz Wireless. Rizz Wireless has 5G wide coverage in the USA at affordable rates, starting from $25/month, and cutting-edge eSIM service that provides constant internet access for Americans and international guests.

FalconX, a digital asset broker, said it secured a facility worth over $100 million as part of a “broader credit framework,” while Maple Finance reportedly closed the first tranche of an agreement with Cantor.The service allows companies holding Bitcoin to borrow funds and use the cryptocurrency as collateral, providing a way to unlock liquidity without selling their BTC holdings. Cantor announced its Bitcoin financing business with an initial capital of $2 billion in July 2024, targeting institutional investors seeking to leverage their Bitcoin. At the time, the company said Anchorage Digital and Copper would serve as custodians and collateral managers in the venture.Credit markets are a fundamental part of the financial system, allowing capital to flow between borrowers and lenders and supporting economic activity across sectors. Their central role also means they can contribute to financial distress when risks are mismanaged. While mirroring some functions of traditional finance, crypto credit markets have been operating with less regulatory oversight.Digital asset crisis of 2022 This dynamic was evident during the 2022 crisis in the digital asset sector. Celsius Network, once a leading crypto lending platform, collapsed after engaging in risky financial practices and facing allegations of fraud. Similarly, BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2022 following significant exposure to the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.  According to a report from Galaxy, the total crypto lending market, including crypto-backed collateralized debt positions (CDPs) tied to stablecoins, stood at $36.5 billion in the last quarter of 2024, marking a 43% decline from its all-time high of $64.4 billion in 2021. Despite the broader contraction, onchain lending platforms have seen a dramatic rebound, with open borrowed positions surging to $19.1 billion by Q4 2024, a 959% increase over two years.

Bitcoin’s bullish momentum aligns with the favorable US financial conditions, as noted by Ecoinometrics. The macroeconomic-focused Bitcoin newsletter highlighted that the National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) shows a rapid shift to ultra-loose territory after a tightening phase in February 2025. The NFCI, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, tracks stress in the financial system by aggregating measures like credit spreads, leverage, and funding conditions. When the index moves into looser territory, it reflects easier access to capital and reduced market stress—conditions that typically encourage risk-taking behavior among investors. For high-beta assets like Bitcoin, such periods often coincide with price rallies as capital flows into speculative markets.US National Financial Conditions Index.

It’s tracking the same pattern we saw since 2023: easing conditions → capital rotation → risk-on.”With Bitcoin just 2% away from its all-time high price, data from CoinGlass indicates that the probability of a short-squeeze remains high due to significant sell-side liquidity.

2025-05-27T15:40:00.000Z,"93% of all Bitcoin is already mined. Here’s what that means","How much Bitcoin is left to mine?              Bitcoin’s total supply is hardcoded at 21 million BTC, a fixed upper limit that cannot be altered without a consensus-breaking change to the protocol. This finite cap is enforced at the protocol level and is central to Bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset.As of May 2025, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoin (BTC) have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created, and those remaining coins will be mined very slowly.The reason for this uneven distribution is Bitcoin’s exponential issuance schedule, governed by an event called the halving. When Bitcoin launched in 2009, the block reward was 50 BTC. Every 210,000 blocks — or approximately every four years — that reward is cut in half. Because the early rewards were so large, over 87% of the total supply was mined by the end of 2020. Each subsequent halving sharply reduces the rate of new issuance, meaning it will take over a century to mine the remaining 6.7%.According to current estimates, 99% of all Bitcoin will have been mined by 2035, but the final fraction — the last satoshis — won’t be produced until around the year 2140 due to the nature of geometric reward reduction.This engineered scarcity, combined with an immutable supply cap, is what draws comparisons between Bitcoin and physical commodities like gold. But Bitcoin is even more predictable: Gold’s supply grows at around 1.7% annually, whereas Bitcoin’s issuance rate is transparently declining.Did you know? Bitcoin’s supply curve is not terminal in the traditional sense. It follows an asymptotic trajectory — a kind of economic Zeno’s paradox — where rewards diminish indefinitely but never truly reach zero. Mining will continue until around 2140, by which point over 99.999% of the total 21 million BTC will have been issued.                  Beyond the supply cap: How lost coins make Bitcoin scarcer than you think              While over 93% of Bitcoin’s total supply has been mined, that doesn’t mean it’s all available. A significant portion is permanently out of circulation, lost due to forgotten passwords, misplaced wallets, destroyed hard drives or early adopters who never touched their coins again.Estimates from firms like Chainalysis and Glassnode suggest that between 3.0 million and 3.8 million BTC — roughly 14%-18% of the total supply — is likely gone for good. That includes high-profile dormant addresses like the one believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, which alone holds over 1.1 million BTC.This means Bitcoin’s true circulating supply may be closer to 16 million-17 million, not 21 million. And because Bitcoin is non-recoverable by design, any lost coins stay lost — permanently reducing supply over time.Now compare that to gold. Around 85% of the world’s total gold supply has been mined — approximately 216,265 metric tons, according to the World Gold Council — but nearly all of it remains in circulation or held in vaults, jewelry, ETFs and central banks. Gold can be remelted and reused; Bitcoin cannot be resurrected once access is lost.This distinction gives Bitcoin a kind of hardening scarcity, a supply that not only stops growing over time but quietly shrinks.As Bitcoin matures, it’s entering a monetary phase similar to gold: low issuance, high holder concentration and increasing demand-side sensitivity. But Bitcoin takes it further; its supply cap is hard, its loss rate is permanent, and its distribution is publicly auditable.This may lead to several outcomes:Increased price volatility as available supply becomes more limited and sensitive to market demandHigher long-term value concentration in the hands of those who remain active and secure in their key managementA premium on liquidity, where actually spendable BTC trades at a higher effective value than dormant supply.In extreme cases, this could produce a bifurcation between “circulating BTC” and “unreachable BTC,” with the former gaining greater economic significance, particularly in times of constrained exchange liquidity or macroeconomic stress.                  What happens when Bitcoin is fully mined?              There’s a popular assumption that as Bitcoin’s block rewards shrink, the network’s security will eventually suffer. But in practice, the mining economy is far more adaptive — and much more resilient — than that.Bitcoin’s mining incentives are governed by a self-correcting feedback loop: If mining becomes unprofitable, miners drop off the network, which in turn triggers a difficulty adjustment. Every 2,016 blocks (roughly every two weeks), the network recalibrates mining difficulty using a parameter known as nBits. The goal is to keep block times steady at around 10 minutes, regardless of how many miners are competing.So, if Bitcoin’s price drops, or the reward becomes too small relative to operating costs, inefficient miners simply exit. This causes difficulty to fall, lowering the cost for those who remain. The result is a system that continually rebalances itself, aligning network participation with available incentives.This mechanism has already been tested at scale. After China banned mining in mid-2021, Bitcoin’s global hashrate dropped by more than 50% in a matter of weeks. Yet the network continued to function without interruption, and within a few months, the hashrate fully recovered, as miners resumed operations in jurisdictions with lower energy costs and more favorable regulations.Critically, the idea that lower rewards will inherently threaten network security overlooks how mining is tied to profit margins, not nominal BTC amounts. As long as the market price supports the cost of hash power — even at 0.78125 BTC per block (post-2028 halving) or lower — miners will continue to secure the network.In other words, it’s not the absolute reward that matters, but whether mining remains profitable relative to costs. And thanks to Bitcoin’s built-in difficulty adjustment, it usually does.Even a century from now, when the block reward approaches zero, the network will likely still be protected by whatever combination of fees, base incentives and infrastructure efficiency exists at that time. But that’s a distant concern. In the meantime, the current system — hashrate adjusts, difficulty rebalances, miners adapt — remains one of the most robust elements of Bitcoin’s design.Did you know? On April 20, 2024, following the launch of the Runes protocol, Bitcoin miners earned over $80 million in transaction fees within a single day, surpassing the $26 million earned from block rewards. This marked the first time in Bitcoin’s history that transaction fees alone exceeded the block subsidy in daily miner revenue.                  The future of Bitcoin mining: Energy consumption              It’s a common misconception that rising Bitcoin prices will drive endless energy use. In reality, mining is constrained by profitability, not price alone.As block rewards shrink, miners are pushed toward thinner margins, and that means chasing the cheapest, cleanest energy available. Since China’s 2021 mining ban, hashrate has migrated to regions like North America and Northern Europe, where operators tap into surplus hydro, wind and underutilized grid energy.According to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, between 52% and 59% of Bitcoin mining now runs on renewables or low-emission sources. Regulations are reinforcing this trend, with several jurisdictions offering incentives for clean-powered mining or penalizing fossil-fuel operations.Moreover, the idea that higher BTC prices will always mean higher energy use misses how Bitcoin self-regulates: More miners raise difficulty, which compresses margins, capping energy expansion. Renewable-based mining brings its own challenges, but the dystopian future of endlessly expanding fossil-fueled hash power is increasingly unlikely.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/93-of-all-bitcoin-is-already-mined-heres-what-that-means?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T15:00:00.000Z,"ZKPs can prove I&#039;m old enough without telling you my age","Opinion by: Andre Omietanski, General Counsel, and Amal Ibraymi, Legal Counsel at Aztec LabsWhat if you could prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthday, name, or anything else at all? Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) make this hypothetical a reality and solve one of the key challenges online: verifying age without sacrificing privacy. The need for better age verification todayWe're witnessing an uptick in laws being proposed restricting minors' access to social media and the internet, including in Australia, Florida, and China. To protect minors from inappropriate adult content, platform owners and governments often walk a tightrope between inaction and overreach. For example, the state of Louisiana in the US recently enacted a law meant to block minors from viewing porn. Sites required users to upload an ID before viewing content. The Free Speech Coalition challenged the law as unconstitutional, making the case that it infringed on First Amendment rights. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed on procedural grounds. The reaction, however, highlights the dilemma facing policymakers and platforms: how to block minors without violating adults' rights or creating new privacy risks.Traditional age verification failsCurrent age verification tools are either ineffective or invasive. Self-declaration is meaningless, since users can simply lie about their age. ID-based verification is overly invasive. No one should be required to upload their most sensitive documents, putting themselves at risk of data breaches and identity theft. Biometric solutions like fingerprints and face scans are convenient for users but raise important ethical, privacy, and security concerns. Biometric systems are not always accurate and may generate false positives and negatives. The irreversible nature of the data, which can't be changed like a regular password can, is also less than ideal. Other methods, like behavioral tracking and AI-driven verification of browser patterns, are also problematic, using machine learning to analyze user interactions and identify patterns and anomalies, raising concerns of a surveillance culture.ZKPs as the privacy-preserving solutionZero-knowledge proofs present a compelling solution. Like a government ID provider, a trusted entity verifies the user's age and generates a cryptographic proof confirming they are over the required age. Websites only need to check the proof, not the excess personal data, ensuring privacy while keeping minors at the gates. No centralized data storage is required, alleviating the burden on platforms such as Google, Meta, and WhatsApp and eliminating the risk of data breaches. Recent: How zero-knowledge proofs can make AI fairerAdopting and enforcing ZKPs at scaleZKPs aren't a silver bullet. They can be complex to implement. The notion of \""don't trust, verify,\"" proven by indisputable mathematics, may cause some regulatory skepticism. Policymakers may hesitate to trust cryptographic proofs over visible ID verification. There are occasions when companies may need to disclose personal information to authorities, such as during an investigation into financial crimes or government inquiries. This would challenge ZKPs, whose very intention is for platforms not to hold this data in the first place.ZKPs also struggle with scalability and performance, being somewhat computationally intensive and tricky to program. Efficient implementation techniques are being explored, and breakthroughs, such as the Noir programming language, are making ZKPs more accessible to developers, driving the adoption of secure, privacy-first solutions. A safer, smarter future for age verificationGoogle's move to adopt ZKPs for age verification is a promising signal that mainstream platforms are beginning to embrace privacy-preserving technologies. But to fully realize the potential of ZKPs, we need more than isolated solutions locked into proprietary ecosystems. Crypto-native wallets can go further. Open-source and permissionless blockchain-based systems offer interoperability, composability, and programmable identity. With a single proof, users can access a range of services across the open web — no need to start from scratch every time, or trust a single provider (Google) with their credentials.ZKPs flip the script on online identity — proving what matters, without exposing anything else. They protect user privacy, help platforms stay compliant, and block minors from restricted content, all without creating new honeypots of sensitive data.Google's adoption of ZKPs shows mainstream momentum is building. But to truly transform digital identity, we must embrace crypto-native, decentralized systems that give users control over what they share and who they are online.In an era defined by surveillance, ZKPs offer a better path forward — one that's secure, private, and built for the future.Opinion by: Andre Omietanski, General Counsel, and Amal Ibraymi, Legal Counsel at Aztec Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-27T14:30:00.000Z,"What is a cryptocurrency mixer and how does it work?","Cryptocurrency mixers explained              A cryptocurrency mixer is a specialized service designed to increase the privacy and anonymity of blockchain transactions. Unlike traditional financial transactions, which are private by default, most cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) operate on public blockchains. This means every transaction is permanently recorded and accessible to anyone, making it possible for blockchain analysts or malicious actors to trace the flow of funds between wallets.A crypto mixer’s primary function is to break the link between the sender’s wallet and the recipient’s wallet. It does so by pooling together coins from many users and then redistributing them in a way that makes it difficult to track which coins went where. Think of it like a digital version of shuffling cards in a deck. After mixing, your cryptocurrency is returned to you or a recipient’s address, but it’s “cleaned” of any direct transaction history.This privacy-enhancing feature is why some people rely on mixers, especially those seeking to keep their financial activities confidential in an open-ledger world.                  How does a crypto mixer work?              To understand a crypto mixer, it’s useful to compare it to the concept of money laundering in traditional finance, albeit with legal and ethical nuances. The process of “mixing” is essentially designed to obscure the origin and destination of coins.Here’s a typical workflow of how a cryptocurrency mixer operates:Deposit: You send your cryptocurrency to the mixer’s wallet address. Multiple users do the same, creating a large pool of coins.Mixing/shuffling: The mixer’s system pools and shuffles these coins together, breaking any visible connection between deposited and withdrawn funds.Redistribution: After mixing, the service sends back an equivalent amount of coins to your specified address, but these aren’t the same coins you deposited. They come from the pooled coins of all participants.Fees: The mixer usually deducts a small fee, generally ranging from 1% to 3%, to cover operational costs.This process effectively disrupts blockchain analysis, making it extremely difficult for anyone to trace the coins back to their original owners.                  Types of cryptocurrency mixers              Not all mixers are created equal. They can broadly be divided into two categories: centralized and decentralized mixers.Centralized mixersCentralized mixers are the most common and operate similarly to traditional services. You send your coins to a company or entity that controls the mixing process, and then they send back “clean” coins after mixing. These services are relatively easy to use, often providing a simple user interface.However, centralized mixers require you to trust the service operator with your coins, at least temporarily. This introduces risks such as:The mixer could be a scam and disappear with your funds.It could be hacked, exposing users’ data and coins.The operator may keep logs that could compromise your privacy.Decentralized mixersDecentralized mixers use blockchain technology and smart contracts to automate the mixing process without a trusted third party. They rely on cryptographic methods such as zero-knowledge proofs to mix coins in a trustless environment. Users pool their coins into a smart contract, which then redistributes coins in a way that ensures privacy.Advantages of decentralized mixers include:No central point of failure or custody risk.Higher privacy because no single party controls the funds.Often more resistant to regulatory crackdowns.Did you know? The DOJ indicted four Russians for operating crypto mixers Blender.io and Sinbad.io, yet failed to show they knowingly laundered illicit funds. The indictment relies heavily on vague forum posts and lacks concrete evidence of criminal intent or ties to US commerce, raising serious doubts about its strength in court.                  Real-world cases involving mixers and scams              Unfortunately, the privacy offered by crypto mixers has also attracted criminals. The very anonymity that protects innocent users can also shield illicit activities, leading to widespread misuse.Crypto mixers have been linked to ransomware attacks, dark web marketplaces, fraud and drug trafficking. Criminals often use these services to “clean” proceeds from illegal transactions and hide their tracks from law enforcement.A notable example is ChipMixer, a service seized by Europol in 2023 for allegedly facilitating money laundering for dark web markets and ransomware groups. Authorities dismantled the platform’s infrastructure over alleged money laundering, seizing four servers, 1,909.4 BTC (about $210 million as of May 26, 2025) and seven TB of data across 55 transactions.Mixers have also been involved in laundering stolen funds from cryptocurrency exchange hacks. The complexity of these transactions makes it difficult for investigators to recover stolen assets.In February 2025, Bybit, a major cryptocurrency exchange, suffered a significant security breach resulting in the theft of about $1.5 billion worth of cryptocurrencies. The attackers, attributed to the Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking organization, employed various crypto mixers, including Wasabi, CryptoMixer, Railgun and Tornado Cash, to launder portions of the stolen assets. Despite efforts to trace the funds, a significant portion remains unaccounted for, highlighting the challenges posed by mixers in cybersecurity investigations.                  Are crypto mixers legal?              The legal status of cryptocurrency mixers depends largely on the jurisdiction and context of their use.Most governments impose strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing regulations on financial services, including digital currency services. Mixers, by their nature, complicate AML compliance because they obscure transaction trails.For instance,In the European Union, the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD) includes digital currency providers under its regulatory scope, requiring them to perform KYC checks and report suspicious activity.In the United States, FinCEN classifies cryptocurrency mixers as money transmitters, requiring registration and compliance with AML regulations. Unlicensed mixers can face severe penalties and criminal charges.Legal uses vs misuseUsing a mixer for privacy reasons is not inherently illegal. However, if mixers are used to launder proceeds from crimes, authorities will prosecute offenders. Similarly, operating a mixer without appropriate licenses or regulatory oversight can be illegal.If you choose to use a mixer, make sure you understand the legal implications in your country and avoid any activity that could be linked to money laundering or fraud.Did you know? Crypto mixer transactions are still taxable. Using a mixer doesn’t hide gains from tax authorities; failing to report them can trigger audits or penalties. Always keep records and understand your local tax obligations.                  How to stay safe and avoid scam-linked mixers              If you decide to use a cryptocurrency mixer, your safety and security should be paramount. Here are some essential tips to avoid scams and legal troubles:Choose reputable mixers: Conduct thorough research. Look for mixers with good reviews, transparent operations and clear compliance policies.Avoid unknown or suspicious services: Steer clear of mixers linked to scams, hacks or regulatory actions.Check for licensing and compliance: Prefer mixers that comply with AML/KYC regulations, especially if you are a business or high-value user.Understand fees and timelines: Be clear on the fees involved and the expected time for your funds to be returned after mixing.Use hardware wallets and strong security practices: Always safeguard your private keys and use hardware wallets to minimize risks.Stay updated on regulations: Laws surrounding crypto mixers evolve rapidly. Staying informed will help you avoid inadvertent legal violations.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-mixer-and-how-does-it-work?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

With thousands of projects emerging or disappearing, you need innovative ways to separate signal from noise. AI solutions such as ChatGPT and Grok could benefit you as your research assistant, reducing research time and delivering actionable information. This article discusses how to use both platforms to make better decisions regarding investment in altcoins.How to share content with ChatGPT and GrokBoth ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 allow you to share content in three ways. You can simply paste content in the text box with inverted commas and write your prompt. Alternatively, you can upload a document from your local drive or Google Drive on ChatGPT 4o. If you are working with Grok 3, you could upload a file from your local drive or connect a file on Google Drive and Microsoft Drive to the AI platform.On both ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3, you can paste a link in the text box and write a prompt for the AI engine.Use ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 to analyze complex data and draw quick conclusionsChatGPT 4o excels at processing and simplifying extensive and often fragmented information. Altcoin projects tend to have extensive white papers and technical documentation. It takes time to get through all the information, analyze it, and draw conclusions. With ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3, you can easily get the information you need without spending hours reading the content. You can use the AI platforms for:Summarizing extensive documentation: You could get a quick summary of vast information that might go into thousands of words, using a prompt like “Summarize this document in plain English with pros, cons and use cases.”Analyzing tokenomics: You could ask the AI platforms for the altcoin project’s breakdown of inflation, token distribution and staking models. For example, you could use a prompt such as “Explain the tokenomics of [Altcoin Name] and its impact on price.” Deconstructing roadmaps: Projects often publish unrealistic roadmaps that are hard to implement. AI platforms could quickly analyze the relevancy of roadmaps and suggest to you what you could expect of them. You could use prompts like, “What are the most realistic milestones in this roadmap for 2025?”Spotting red flags: The goal is not just to understand but to spot red flags, such as overpromising, vague goals or lack of technical updates. Did you know? ChatGPT is trained on vast crypto data sets and can explain trends, decode memes, or simplify DeFi tools — even if you are just starting your crypto learning journey.Ask for competitive comparisons on ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 can be valuable tools for quickly comparing different cryptocurrency projects. To begin with, state the names of the cryptocurrencies you want to compare. Also mention the criteria such as use case, consensus process, tokenomics and development activities. For example, you can use the prompt, “Create a table comparing Solana and Avalanche in terms of transaction speed, fees and developer adoption.” Here is a response from ChatGPT 4o:And this is Grok 3’s response for the same prompt:AI tools typically use tables or bullet points for an answer. You can also ask additional questions to delve deeper into topics like security, scalability and partnerships. This allows for more efficient evaluation of many projects without the need to search through multiple sources.To get a market-layer view on ChatGPT 4o, you can use the prompt: “Create a table of five layer-1 altcoins with higher throughput than Ethereum and evaluate their adoption metrics.” Here is the output of ChatGPT 4o:Grok 3 gave the following response using the same prompt:These comparisons help you map out where each altcoin stands relative to its peers and whether it offers a genuine edge.Did you know? Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot was built with a rebellious tone. It excels at quickly pulling crypto insights directly from social chatter, perfect for memecoin hunters.Find info about developer activityDeveloper traction is a dependable indicator of an altcoin’s long-term potential. Use ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 to find information about overall growth in development activity, surges after certain upgrades, developer count and contributions, commit activity, network upgrades and challenges before developers.You could use prompts like:“What has been the developer activity trend on [Project ] over the last 6 months?”You can also request ecosystem breakdowns with prompts like:“List top DeFi projects built on Arbitrum with TVL over $10 million.”ChatGPT 4o generated the following response for this prompt:Here is Grok 3’s response for the same prompt:ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 can synthesize data points from multiple sources and give you a cleaner picture faster than manual web browsing. You could track sudden price spikes with a prompt like:“In 100 words, write why is $RNDR trending right now?”Here is ChatGPT 4o’s response for this prompt:This is Grok 3’s response for the same prompt:Grok 3 is particularly useful for monitoring real-time sentiment and news. Grok 3 is ideal for real-time analysis of trends, especially on X, where crypto narratives form quickly. Grok 3 will pull recent posts, mentions and news threads to explain the momentum. It can monitor influencer sentiment.For deeper and quicker research, you can use ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 together.Don’t just trust the bots — verify the alphaAI tools like ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 offer powerful support in the altcoin research process, enabling faster analysis, broader comparisons and streamlined access to information. However, even advanced AI models can occasionally misinterpret data or miss contextual nuances. As such, it is essential to treat their responses as a starting point — not a final answer.When using these tools, take the time to compare outputs, evaluate the sources referenced, and cross-check insights against real-world data. Discrepancies between ChatGPT and Grok responses should prompt further investigation, not automatic preference.Ultimately, these platforms are most effective when used to enhance critical thinking and research efficiency rather than replace human judgment.In a fast-moving industry like Web3, effective research requires diligence, curiosity and verification. By applying these principles, you can make more confident and informed investment decisions in the altcoin space.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-27T12:00:15.000Z,"StarkWare launches mobile-friendly zero-knowledge prover","Blockchain company StarkWare has unveiled zero-knowledge (ZK) prover STARK Two (S-two), enabling enhanced privacy and verification on everyday devices like phones, laptops and browsers. The company said the new ZK prover allows users to generate complex cryptographic proofs from the client side. This means users can generate ZK-proofs directly on their devices instead of relying on a server or cloud infrastructure, opening the door for faster and more private applications across the internet. “S-two will bring STARK proving to everyday devices, and open the door for new real-world proving use cases,” said Eli Ben-Sasson, StarkWare co-founder and CEO, adding that the tool could empower the next wave of ZK applications. The company said the ZK prover is now available in public alpha and is set to roll out on Starknet, its Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, later this year.  StarkWare says new ZK prover is 39 times faster than old solutions StarkWare said that benchmark tests for the S-two ZK prover showed that it was 39 times faster than previous solutions. The performance leap enables smoother experiences in privacy-enhancing applications. The upgrade also allows use cases in private transactions, ZK-based identity and verifiable artificial intelligence. StarkWare said S-two runs on CPUs, GPUs and will soon be on browsers. “For years we’ve called the prover our magic wand, a tool that transforms complex computation into a simple proof,” Ben-Sasson said. “Now, the wand has become a lightsaber in your pocket, something anyone can wield, instantly, from your own device.”According to StarkWare, developers can build with S-two, adding that its alpha release supports hardware targets. Furthermore, the company said ZK ecosystem participants like Kakarot, Nexus, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs have already adopted the technology. Kakarot uses S-two inside ETHProofs to generate Ethereum block proofs more efficiently, while Nexus is standardizing RISC-V traces to align with S-two’s architecture. Meanwhile, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs are adding GPU acceleration to push the prover’s performance even further.Use cases for S-two zero-knowledge proverStarkWare chief operating officer Oren Katz told Cointelegraph that S-two marks a shift in how ZK-proofs are used in daily lives. Generating validity proofs directly in devices will allow privacy-preserving features in messaging, payments and digital identity. “You can prove a payment was valid without showing your balance, or verify identity without revealing personal details,” Katz added. Katz said that even salary payments could be made onchain with full transparency and no exposure of sensitive information. He dubbed the development a “big step toward bringing zero-knowledge tech into the mainstream.”Beyond privacy, Katz said, local proof generation also unlocks use cases in other industries. The executive told Cointelegraph that it can allow gamers to play offline and later generate cryptographic proof of their achievements. “An operator, instead of running all logic onchain to prove integrity, can run it on their own servers and simply generate a proof that it was executed correctly,” Katz added.Related: Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden’s cashless-society rethinkNew ZK prover follows Ethereum’s privacy pushThe launch of StarWare’s upgraded ZK prover follows Ethereum’s push for better privacy. On April 11, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin published a roadmap that addressed privacy enhancements for wallets, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and infrastructure. Buterin advocated implementing privacy-enhancing norms and features across the Ethereum ecosystem, including adding privacy tools in ETH wallets. Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/starkware-unveils-s-two-client-side-zk-prover?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

According to a Pendle report, yield-bearing stablecoins climbed from $1.5 billion at the start of 2024 to $11 billion as of May 21. This represents 4.5% of the entire stablecoin market. The growth of yield-bearing stablecoins is attributed to increasing regulatory clarity in the United States under President Donald Trump’s administration. According to a Feb. 18 filing, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved exchange operator Figure Markets’ interest-bearing stablecoin. This made the company the first to receive US approval for a yield-bearing stablecoin. Apart from a favorable response from the SEC, proposed bills like the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) also signal a positive direction for stablecoins in the US. Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitget-enters-real-world-asset-race-with-yield-bearing-bgusd-stablecoin?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T08:45:00.000Z,"How central banks are testing blockchain-based monetary policy","Why are central banks looking at blockchains?              Central banks are tiptoeing into the world of blockchain not because it is fashionable but because every part of the money-making machine, from settlement rails to asset custody, is slowly being rewritten as code.The financial industry is already tokenizing money-market funds, Treasurys and even bank deposits. According to the Atlantic Council, 134 jurisdictions are studying or piloting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), up from just 35 in 2020. Meanwhile, commercial banks have begun to warn that if they cannot move tokenized deposits across public blockchains such as Solana or private ledgers like R3 Corda, they risk being left behind.From a central bank’s vantage point, two questions matter:First, can traditional operations, such as open-market purchases, standing facilities and reserve remuneration still work if reserves and government bonds become smart tokens? Second, can monetary transmission improve when policy logic is hard-wired into code? These questions motivate pilots such as Project Pine, Project Guardian in Singapore, the Bank of England’s wholesale CBDC sandbox and Japan’s multiyear retail CBDC pilot.                  What is “tokenized” monetary policy?              Tokenized monetary policy means that the liabilities and assets a central bank uses to steer short-term interest rates exist as programmable tokens on a distributed-ledger platform. In such a token arrangement, what the BIS describes as an ecosystem where money and securities share a common ledger, monetary functions are executed by smart contracts, replacing the traditional batch file processes used in overnight real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems.In practice, each policy tool is expressed as code:Interest on reserves becomes an automated coupon that accrues to a wallet address once a block closes.Repo and reverse-repo agreements become conditional asset swaps that self-liquidate at maturity.Collateral haircuts are numeric parameters the central bank can toggle in real time, with changes propagating instantly to all counterparties.Project Pine demonstrated all three, using ERC-20 tokens for reserves and securities on a permissioned Ethereum-compatible chain.But how is tokenized monetary policy different from traditional monetary policy?Traditional policy operations rely on central bank systems such as Fedwire or the Bank of England’s RTGS. These systems close overnight, settle in discrete batches and require multiple human sign-offs. A tokenized system settles atomically in seconds, keeps an immutable audit trail and lets policy adjustments propagate without waiting for dealers to book trades. The BIS paper on tokenisation notes that combining assets and settlement on a single ledger can shrink operational risk and latency.Did you know? A repo is a short-term secured loan in which one party sells securities and agrees to repurchase them later at a higher price. In contrast, a reverse repo is the same transaction viewed from the counterparty’s perspective (buying the securities and later reselling them).                  What is Project Pine?              Project Pine is a research initiative led by the BIS Innovation Hub and the New York Fed that explores how central banks could run monetary policy in a future where money and government securities are digital tokens managed on blockchain-like systems.Launched in late 2024 and published in May 2025, the project built a working prototype, a “starter kit” for central banks, designed to test whether tools like interest on reserves, repo operations and asset purchases can be run using smart contracts.The project ran simulated financial scenarios, mimicking both calm and crisis conditions:Normal conditions: The smart contract automatically conducted a one-day reverse-repo, draining reserves by posting bids at a pre-set interest rate.Liquidity shock: When simulated market stress pushed interest rates too high, an emergency lending facility kicked in automatically, within seconds, helping stabilize rates.Asset-purchase program: The toolkit accepted bids, calculated allocations and settled trades between digital reserves and tokenized bonds instantly.These scenarios were run in a test environment with simulated commercial banks and a programmable blockchain platform. Everything from interest payments to collateral valuation was automated, providing a glimpse into how monetary policy might function in a 24/7, tokenized financial system.This was not an isolated experiment. Other central banks are running parallel pilots that explore similar ground with their distinct approaches:Although temporarily offline as of May 24, 2025, MAS news releases show that Singapore’s Project Guardian has tested tokenized deposits and government bonds in live repo transactions, proving that interbank settlement can occur on a shared DLT without sending payments through Swift.Meanwhile, the Bank of England has taken a dual-rail approach. A July 2024 discussion paper stresses that wholesale tokenized money could sit alongside RTGS balances, letting commercial banks pick whichever rail meets their liquidity needs. Governor Andrew Bailey has warned that if tokenized deposits stall, the Bank “must continue to prepare for a wholesale CBDC.”On the retail front, Japan’s multi-year programme has entered a live “pilot” phase, constructing an end-to-end infrastructure, from smartphone wallets to a central ledger, capable of handling tens of thousands of transactions per second. The pilot also explores privacy-enhancing overlays, reflecting consumer expectations for cash-like anonymity.Taken together, these pilots confirm that key features like programmability, real-time visibility, and atomic settlement are no longer theoretical — they work. They don’t yet answer the more challenging question: How do central banks transition an entire financial system to such rails without disrupting credit creation and intermediation?Did you know? Project Pine’s digital monetary system is built like a three-layer cake: The bottom layer is a programmable blockchain (Besu), the middle is packed with tokenized money and assets (like ERC-20 reserves) and the top layer runs the smart contracts that carry out monetary policy actions.                  Why is Project Pine important?              Project Pine is the first of its kind to show that core central bank tools could be rebuilt using smart contracts. It proves that:Policy tools can be deployed faster, possibly within seconds.Facilities like repo or asset purchases can adapt automatically to changing market conditions.Tokenization could streamline operations, reduce friction and offer greater flexibility.Who was involved in Project Pine experiments?Seven major central banks, including those of Australia, Canada, England, Mexico, Switzerland, the EU and the US, collaborated on shaping the toolkit and defining test requirements. The findings don’t commit any of these banks to adopt such systems, but they provide a solid foundation for future research and policymaking.What did Project Pine test?To see how well the system works, Project Pine ran tests based on real-world situations, such as raising interest rates or a government debt crisis. They tried short and long periods, small and large financial systems, tight and loose money conditions and different ways of lending (like bank loans or corporate bonds). This helped check if the system could handle all kinds of economic ups and downs.Did you know? In Project Pine, central bank operations like paying interest on reserves or managing collateral aren’t done manually; they're handled by smart contracts coded directly into the top “protocol layer” of the blockchain stack.                  Practical design challenges in tokenized monetary policy              As central banks explore moving policy tools onto blockchains, they face several significant design hurdles. These aren’t just technical. They’re legal, operational and even philosophical. Here are the key ones:Interoperability: Can different blockchains talk to each other? Today’s financial system is like a highway with shared rules. However, blockchain ecosystems are more like separate islands, each with its own rules and roads. Public networks like Solana, private ones like Corda, or permissioned platforms like Besu don’t always “talk” to each other smoothly. This can cause issues like payment delays or funds getting stuck between platforms. Experts also warn that if too many users gather around one dominant blockchain, it could create unhealthy concentration, making the whole system more fragile.Legal finality: Does blockchain data legally count? Many countries still treat blockchain records as transaction evidence, not legally binding proof of ownership. So, even if a tokenized treasury bond moves onchain, the law might still require a separate “golden record” kept offchain by a trusted authority. Until legal systems catch up, this split could limit how far tokenized finance can go.Cyber resilience: What happens when something goes wrong? Blockchain systems run on code, and that code can have bugs. In a traditional setup, if something breaks, humans can step in. But with smart contracts, “code is law.” That’s why countries like Japan are building complete backup plans into their pilots. They’re testing how to respond to cyberattacks, technical failures or even smart contract glitches because in a digital money system, even a small error could have significant consequences.Privacy vs transparency: How much should be visible? Banks and regulators need transparency to monitor financial risks and prevent crime. But regular people want privacy, especially when using money for everyday purchases. Balancing those two needs is tricky. Policymakers are now experimenting with ideas like tiered disclosure (more visibility for big transactions), zero-knowledge proofs (which let you prove something without revealing all details), and even “anonymity vouchers” that let users make some transactions without being tracked.These challenges aren’t deal-breakers, but they do show that making money programmable isn’t as simple as flipping a switch. Central banks must work closely with lawmakers, cybersecurity experts and the financial industry to ensure tokenized monetary systems are safe, fair and reliable.                  The road ahead              The future of tokenized monetary policy will likely unfold in carefully staged phases, balancing innovation with financial stability.The BIS Innovation Hub lists more than a dozen ongoing tokenization projects from Australia’s Project Dunbar (multi-CBDC bridge) to Switzerland’s Project Helvetia (DLT-based repo). Commercial banks, meanwhile, are shifting rails: HSBC settled its first tokenized-deposit payment in April 2025, and Euroclear is piloting blockchain settlement for tokenized bonds.Central banks face a coordination game: Go slow and risk private standards hardening around them; go too fast and upend the funding model of commercial banks. The likeliest path is a phased approach:Stage 1: Limited-scope wholesale CBDC sandboxes plus tokenized collateral for central-bank counterparties.Stage 2: Dual-rail environments where RTGS balances and tokenized reserves interoperate via synchronization layers.Stage 3: Full adoption of smart-contract-based policy tools, possibly including real-time fiscal transfers.Just as earlier shifts like the rollout of RTGS systems or inflation-targeting regimes were introduced gradually to test and refine their impact, tokenized systems will be phased in through pilots, sandboxes and hybrid models before full-scale adoption.Whether it ultimately reshapes how central banks manage the economy remains to be seen.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-central-banks-are-testing-blockchain-based-monetary-policy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The initiative, currently under review by the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Thailand, will enable tourists to link their crypto holdings to credit cards for local purchases.Merchants will receive Thai baht as usual, often without knowing crypto was used in the transaction. The pilot is expected to roll out after key infrastructure and regulatory checks are in place.“This approach can be immediately adapted for Thailand, provided the supporting systems are in place,” said Pichai, noting that the model avoids using the Thai baht directly, reducing risks to the domestic currency.Related: Crypto exchange KuCoin enters crowded Thailand marketCapital markets regulation under reviewBeyond enabling crypto use for tourism, Thailand is also planning a reform of its financial laws.

As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave.However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation.This caused the long-term holder realized capitalization to surge past $28 billion, a level not seen since April. Realized cap is a measure of the value of each Bitcoin based on the last time it was moved, rather than the current market price.Long-term investors are using this period of forced selling to increase their exposure and accumulate more Bitcoin for the long run, Amr Taha noted. “This strategic accumulation during moments of market stress reflects the deep conviction of LTHs.”“Rather than being shaken out by short-term volatility, they [LTH] see these liquidation-driven dips as prime opportunities to strengthen their positions, reinforcing the foundation for future price appreciation.”BTC short-term holders (red) and long-term holders (green) net realized cap.

Gox, but said proof-of-reserves isn’t the correct measure to take for institutions.“No institutional-grade or enterprise security analyst would think it’s a good idea to publish all of the wallet addresses, such that you could be traced back and forth.”“Go to AI, put it in deep think mode and then ask it ‘what are the security problems of publishing your wallet addresses?’ and ‘how might it undermine the security of your company over time,” Saylor said, adding it would write “50 pages of security problems.”Proof-of-reserves increasingly adopted after FTX collapseMany crypto exchanges, custodians and exchange-traded fund issuers started publishing their proof-of-reserves following FTX’s collapse in November 2022 to establish transparency and prove that they hold enough assets to back customer deposits.Related: Strategy bags 4,020 Bitcoin as price briefly breaks $110KCrypto exchanges Binance, Kraken and OKX and crypto asset manager Bitwise are among the industry players that have adopted the transparency measure.However, Saylor noted that proof-of-reserves often only show one side of the picture — what the company holds — and not what they owe.Source: Mitchell AskewSaylor’s Strategy is the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 576,230 Bitcoin worth $62.6 million on its balance sheet, followed by Bitcoin mining firm MARA Holdings, which holds 48,137 Bitcoin, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET.More than 110 publicly traded companies worldwide have purchased and hold Bitcoin.Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/michael-saylor-says-proof-of-reserves-bad-idea?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Since the world has infinite unpredictable possibilities, LeCun believes training must happen through abstraction, which mirrors how humans make sense of the physical world.Meta’s AI brain drain Meanwhile, Meta is experiencing significant talent loss from its AI research team, particularly among the researchers who created the original Llama model in 2023, Insider reported on May 26. Just three of the original 14 Llama authors remain at Meta, and many have joined Mistral, a Paris-based startup co-founded by former Meta researchers and key Llama architects. Meta’s latest release, Llama 4, received a lukewarm reception from developers, many of whom now look to faster-moving rivals that have dedicated reasoning models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o, Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, and the recently launched Claude 4 Sonnet from Anthropic, the report added. On May 15, The Wall Street Journal reported that Meta was delaying the rollout of its flagship AI LLM, Llama 4 “Behemoth.” Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/meta-ai-boss-ai-lacks-intelligent-behavior-report?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

However, FOX5 New York reported that the man may already be in custody, citing conflicting sources.The New York Post reported that the man is the co-founder of a Swiss trading firm.Woeltz, known as the “crypto king of Kentucky,” is facing several charges, including kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment and assault. He allegedly held the victim at his apartment for 17 days.Woeltz’s assistant, Italian-born Beatrice Folchi, was also arrested, however, she was freed, and no charges have been laid against her.The arrests came after Teofrasto Carturan, aged 28 from Italy, managed to escape the apartment on May 23 — the day he had allegedly been told would be his “death day.”CNN reported that Teofrasto Carturan agreed to give up his crypto seed phrase, which was stored on his laptop in another room, and as he went to get his laptop, Woeltz turned his back, allowing him to bolt to the exit.Several New York news outlets shared videos of the victim running outside, barefoot, toward a traffic officer.Sometime after, police arrested Woeltz at his Soho apartment and took him into custody.He remains detained, and his next court date is set for May 28.Alleged victim shares ordealTeofrasto Carturan claimed to police that he arrived from Italy on May 6 and went to the Soho apartment to meet his “business partners.”Sometime later, he claimed his passport was token he was tortured to reveal his crypto seed phrase.

Antpool CEO Andy Chow said:\""Antpool has become the bridge operator for Bitlayer to support Bitcoin innovation and protect miners’ interests.”BitVM (Bitcoin Virtual Machine) is a framework that enables complex smart contracts to be deployed on the Bitcoin blockchain without changing the base protocol. The idea was introduced by Robin Linux in 2023, and allows for the complex computation involved in smart contract systems to be verified onchain and executed offchain in a way resembling optimistic rollups.Related: Here’s how Bitcoin is transforming into Web3’s backboneA BitVM implementationBitlayer is a BitVM implementation, aiming to allow Bitcoin to flow through decentralized finance (DeFi) systems and layer-2 networks. According to Chow, the implementation might lead to heightened activity in Bitcoin’s network and generate revenue for miners:“This expansion of Bitcoin’s use cases will drive more network activity, generating additional transaction fees and revenue opportunities for miners. As block rewards decrease over time, growing fee markets are critical for miners’ sustainable income.“Mining pools such as Chow’s Antpool play a critical role in the adoption of BitVM implementations because they directly determine the inclusion and validation of new types of transactions and scripts at the consensus layer.BitVM requires miners to include custom Taproot-based transactions that encode interactive verification logic. Mining pools must agree to include these non-standard or computationally intensive scripts in blocks, otherwise the protocol would simply not function.Related: StarkWare researchers propose smart contracts for Bitcoin with ColliderVMMining pool supportAccording to Hashrate Index data, Antpool controls 17.2% of Bitcoin’s hashrate as of May 26, while F2Pool controls 8.2% and Spiderpool 6.1%. This results in a total supporting hashrate of  31.5%.Bitcoin hashrate distribution between mining pools. Source: Hash Rate IndexThis is enough to secure transaction inclusion in under one in every three blocks. This is presumably enough for testing, prototyping and early-stage applications.With this percentage of supporting hashrate, developers can build functional systems with the assumption that, despite some latency, BitVM transactions will be processed. So while it is hard to view this hashrate as allowing a fully functional deployment, it is likely enough for the early phases of BitVM development.A Bitlayer representative told Cointelegraph that “should collective hashrate support weaken or policy shifts occur within Bitcoin Core, we have a multi-layered contingency plan.” This plan includes the “expanded mining pool partnerships,” referring to the company’s intention to keep onboarding more mining pools.Magazine: ZK-proofs are bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin — BitcoinOS and Starknet",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitlayer-secures-40-of-bitcoin-s-hashrate-to-bring-smart-contracts-to-btc?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

European stock markets responded positively to the development, but Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to hold the $110,000 level, leading traders to question whether a new all-time high remains within reach.Even if Bitcoin revisits the $105,000 mark, rising institutional interest and robust derivatives markets indicate that bullish traders are neither overleveraged nor concerned about a potential correction.Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized basis rate. Source: laevitas.chDemand for leveraged long Bitcoin positions grew, as evidenced by the BTC futures premium increasing to 8% on May 26. Although this was a modest rise from 6.5% the previous day, the metric still sits comfortably within the neutral range of 5% to 10%. For context, in December 2024, the Bitcoin futures premium surged to 20% when BTC surpassed $100,000 for the first time.Will Nvidia earnings and US economic data ignite Bitcoin price? President Trump’s decision to delay the EU import duties until July 9 reduced some market uncertainty, yet the broader economic consequences of the ongoing tariff conflict have yet to show up in corporate earnings. Investor risk appetite now hinges in part on Nvidia's (NVDA)  May 28 earnings report, and anticipation for this possibly explains Bitcoin’s inability to break through its previous highs.Bitcoin options markets are signaling an increased probability of upward movement.

The recent 5.1% drop in MBA Mortgage Applications for the week ending May 23 prompted traders to adopt a more cautious stance.While Bitcoin derivatives metrics remain healthy, upcoming economic data will be critical for market sentiment.

2025-05-26T16:25:55.000Z,"Decentralized AI could be ‘bigger than Bitcoin’ — DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino","Some of blockchain’s earliest adopters are now deeply “entrenching” themselves in decentralized AI, with ecosystems like Bittsenor (TAO) emerging as growth engines. These platforms are reshaping traditional venture capital models, enabling the best ideas to organically attract community support, staking and liquidity without the need for institutional gatekeepers.That was one of the key takeaways from Cointelegraph’s interview with Chris Miglino, the co-founder and CEO of DNA Fund, a digital asset investment firm he runs alongside fellow serial entrepreneurs Brock Peirce and Scott Walker.DNA Fund manages, among other things, five distinct funds across a range of strategies, such as a high-yield fund, an algorithmic trading fund, an AI compute fund, a liquid token fund and a venture fund — serving both company and investor capital. DNA Fund CEO Chris Miglino, right, and Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi at a DNA House event in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphMiglino, who hosted Cointelegraph at a DNA House event during the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, was particularly excited about the firm’s AI compute fund.“The biggest thing that we’re working on in the whole ecosystem is our AI compute fund, where we’ve been entrenched into the TAO ecosystem,” said Miglino, referring to Bittensor, a decentralized, open-source machine learning network.Bittensor’s backers say the network stands out for its subnets, which enable specialized, incentive-based marketplaces built around a specific AI or machine learning use case. DNA Fund is “actively mining on different subnets,” having committed roughly $50 million worth of compute to the TAO ecosystem, Miglino said. “We’re willing and ready to talk to anybody that wants to launch inside that ecosystem,” he said.A snapshot of Bittensor subnets. Source: TaostatsRelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AI‘Decentralized AI is consuming everything we’re doing’Decentralized AI — the framework for developing and deploying artificial intelligence systems across a distributed network rather than a centralized authority — is currently the main focus at DNA House, Miglino said.It’s “consuming everything we’re doing,” he said. For Miglino, this paradigm has the opportunity to be “bigger than anything that’s ever existed [...] I think it has the opportunity to be bigger than Bitcoin.”While that may appear as a herculean task, given Bitcoin’s (BTC) $2.1 trillion market cap and status as the first successful decentralized monetary system of the information age, technologists broadly agree that AI will profoundly reshape human society.The AI takeover will become more apparent by the 2030s, when the technology is projected to become the world’s valuable tech sector. Source: United Nations Trade and DevelopmentDNA House is betting that ecosystems like Bittensor will drive that transformation in a decentralized way by offering developers the ability to launch businesses without having to raise outside capital: “Develop on the ecosystem, get validators that believe in your idea, [and] that’ll attract the miners and the validators together and all of a sudden you’re in business. You don’t need to go out and raise a ton of money from a bunch of VCs.”The idea that AI’s future will be decentralized is far from fringe. One of the earliest pioneers of artificial general intelligence, Ben Goertzel, told Cointelegraph that he realized the need for decentralization in AI as far back as the early 1990s, before even writing his first line of AI code.Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/decentralized-ai-bittensor-dna-fund-ceo?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-26T15:15:00.000Z,"BlackRock issues rare warning: Is Bitcoin’s future at risk from quantum tech?","BlackRock Bitcoin warning              In a rare move, BlackRock has quietly added a new line to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing — and it is turning heads. The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin’s long-term security.The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin. In their words, it could “undermine the viability” of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack.It’s the first time you’ve seen the world’s largest asset manager call out this threat so directly in a Bitcoin-related disclosure, and it says a lot about how seriously institutional players are starting to take future-proofing crypto.Yes, exchange-traded fund (ETF) risk disclosures tend to be exhaustive by nature. But the fact that quantum computing made the cut (alongside more common concerns like volatility and regulatory shifts) suggests it’s no longer just a hypothetical issue in the eyes of big finance.For investors, this signals two things: first, that Bitcoin isn’t immune to emerging tech threats, and second, that institutional players like BlackRock are actively weighing those risks as they build long-term strategies in crypto. The message is clear: If the industry wants to stay ahead, preparing for a post-quantum world can’t wait.Did you know? As of early 2025, BlackRock manages over $11.6 trillion in assets, making it the largest asset manager globally. To put that in perspective, BlackRock’s assets under management exceed the combined GDP of Germany and France.                  Bitcoin quantum risk: Is it real?              Quantum computers work differently from the laptops and servers we use today. Instead of crunching numbers one at a time, they can process huge numbers of possibilities at once. That makes them incredibly powerful — especially when it comes to cracking codes.Bitcoin’s security relies on two major cryptographic systems: SHA-256 and ECDSA. In plain terms, these are the tools that secure your Bitcoin address and make sure only you can authorize transactions. They’ve worked flawlessly for years, but quantum computers could change that.Here’s the worry: A powerful enough quantum computer might be able to reverse-engineer your private key from your public address, especially during that short window after you’ve broadcast a transaction but before it’s confirmed on the blockchain. If that ever became possible, someone could hijack your transaction and steal your coins.That sounds dramatic, but it’s not an immediate threat. Most researchers agree they’re still at least 10-20 years away from quantum machines that could actually pull this off. The tech just isn’t there yet — not at the scale or stability needed to break Bitcoin’s cryptography.Still, the warning signs are flashing. Roughly a quarter of existing Bitcoin (BTC) sits in older wallet formats that could be more vulnerable if quantum leaps happen faster than expected. And even if the timeline is long, the crypto community knows it has to act early. Work is already underway on post-quantum cryptography, which is a security system that could stand up to the next generation of computing.Did you know? Quantum computers can, in theory, solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. For instance, Google’s Sycamore processor completed a specific task in 200 seconds, whereas it would take even the most advanced classical supercomputers approximately 10,000 years to finish.                  Is Bitcoin safe from quantum computing?              While quantum computing still feels like a future problem, the crypto industry is already gearing up for it, and the efforts underway are more serious than most people realize.What Bitcoin’s doing (and not doing yet)Changing the protocol behind a blockchain is never simple; you need broad consensus, careful testing and a long lead time. But that hasn’t stopped developers from floating ideas regarding Bitcoin.One of the most talked-about proposals is something called QRAMP, the Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol. The idea is to push users to move their coins from older, potentially vulnerable wallet formats into addresses protected by newer, quantum-safe algorithms. It would require a hard fork, so it’s no small lift, but it’s a serious plan to future-proof the network before a so-called “Q-Day” sneaks up.Who’s already ahead?Some blockchains aren’t waiting around. Algorand, for example, has already integrated Falcon, a post-quantum digital signature algorithm that’s been officially vetted by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). That means transactions on Algorand are already being backed by encryption that could hold up even if quantum machines go live tomorrow.The Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) is another big one. It was built from day one with this threat in mind, using XMSS (a hash-based signature scheme) instead of traditional cryptography. It’s not a major player in market cap terms, but it’s one of the most advanced projects in terms of pure security design.Why it’s not easyOf course, none of this is simple to implement. Quantum-safe cryptography often comes with trade-offs. Algorithms like Falcon are compact and efficient, but they still require more computing resources than traditional ones. Moreover, switching everyone — miners, exchanges, wallet apps and individual users — to a new cryptographic standard could be a logistical nightmare unless it’s planned years in advance.Plus, there’s a delicate balance to strike. Move too soon, and you risk breaking things or relying on tech that isn’t battle-tested. Wait too long, and you’re exposed. That’s why many in the space are eyeing a 10-to-20-year window as a rough estimate for when quantum computing becomes a real threat. But even then, nobody wants to be the last to prepare.                  Bitcoin’s future and quantum computing              If there’s one lesson from quantum conversation so far, it’s this: Being early matters. When it comes to tech that could one day rewrite the rules of digital security, waiting around just isn’t an option.So, what does preparation look like?For developers, it starts with testing and integrating quantum-resistant algorithms into existing systems. Some are already experimenting with “hybrid” approaches, using both traditional and post-quantum cryptography side by side, so networks aren’t caught off guard if (or when) Q-Day arrives.For crypto businesses — exchanges, custodians and wallet providers — the job is twofold: Make sure your infrastructure is future-proof, and make sure your users know what’s coming. Education and UX will play a huge role here. Migrating keys and updating protocols isn’t something the average holder can or should do alone.And then there’s the regulatory side — maybe not the most exciting part of crypto, but an absolutely critical one in this context.You are already seeing movement: The NIST finalized several post-quantum cryptographic standards in 2024. That gives the industry a starting point, a common language to build around. But what’s still missing is a clear regulatory push that says, “Here’s how and when this should happen.”Good policy here wouldn’t mean clamping down on innovation — it would mean supporting it. Think: funding open-source research, incentivizing post-quantum upgrades and creating frameworks that help institutions adopt secure standards without killing momentum.Did you know? The US government began preparing for the quantum threat as far back as 2016, and in 2024, the NIST’s move was sparked by growing fears that quantum computers could one day break the encryption protecting everything from Bitcoin to national security infrastructure.A slow burn BlackRock didn’t need to bring up quantum risk in its ETF filing — but it did. And when a company of that size puts it in writing, it turns vague rumors into something much more real.The transition to a quantum-resistant crypto world isn’t going to happen overnight. It’ll be messy, slow and full of tough technical choices. But it has to happen. Finally, waiting until quantum computers are actively breaking SHA-256 in the wild would already be too late.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/blackrock-issues-rare-warning-is-bitcoins-future-at-risk-from-quantum-tech?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-26T15:00:00.000Z,"AI needs better human data, not bigger models","Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at SapienAI is a paper tiger without human expertise in data management and training practices. Despite massive growth projections, AI innovations won’t be relevant if they continue training models based on poor-quality data. Besides improving data standards, AI models need human intervention for contextual understanding and critical thinking to ensure ethical AI development and correct output generation.AI has a “bad data” problemHumans have nuanced awareness. They draw on their experiences to make inferences and logical decisions. AI models are, however, only as good as their training data.An AI model’s accuracy doesn’t entirely depend on the underlying algorithms’ technical sophistication or the amount of data processed. Instead, accurate AI performance depends on trustworthy, high-quality data during training and analytical performance tests.Bad data has multifold ramifications for training AI models: It generates prejudiced output and hallucinations from faulty logic, leading to lost time in retraining AI models to unlearn bad habits, thereby increasing company costs.Biased and statistically underrepresented data disproportionately amplifies flaws and skewed outcomes in AI systems, especially in healthcare and security surveillance.For example, an Innocence Project report lists multiple cases of misidentification, with a former Detroit police chief admitting that relying solely on AI-based facial recognition would lead to 96% misidentifications. Moreover, according to a Harvard Medical School report, an AI model used across US health systems prioritized healthier white patients over sicker black patients. AI models follow the “Garbage In, Garbage Out” (GIGO) concept, as flawed and biased data inputs, or “garbage,” generate poor-quality outputs. Bad input data creates operational inefficiencies as project teams face delays and higher costs in cleaning data sets before resuming model training.Beyond their operational effect, AI models trained on low-quality data erode the trust and confidence of companies in deploying them, causing irreparable reputational damage. According to a research paper, hallucination rates for GPT-3.5 were at 39.6%, stressing the need for additional validation by researchers.Such reputational damages have far-reaching consequences because it becomes difficult to get investments and affects the model’s market positioning. In a CIO Network Summit, 21% of America’s top IT leaders expressed a lack of reliability as the most pressing concern for not using AI.Poor data for training AI models devalues projects and causes enormous economic losses to companies. On average, incomplete and low-quality AI training data results in misinformed decision-making that costs companies 6% of their annual revenue.Recent: Cheaper, faster, riskier — The rise of DeepSeek and its security concernsPoor-quality training data affects AI innovation and model training, so searching for alternative solutions is essential.The bad data problem has forced AI companies to redirect scientists toward preparing data. Almost 67% of data scientists spend their time preparing correct data sets to prevent misinformation delivery from AI models.AI/ML models may struggle to keep up with relevant output unless specialists — real humans with proper credentials — work to refine them. This demonstrates the need for human experts to guide AI’s development by ensuring high-quality curated data for training AI models.Human frontier data is keyElon Musk recently said, “The cumulative sum of human knowledge has been exhausted in AI training.” Nothing could be farther from the truth since human frontier data is the key to driving stronger, more reliable and unbiased AI models.Musk’s dismissal of human knowledge is a call to use artificially produced synthetic data for fine-tuning AI model training. Unlike humans, however, synthetic data lacks real-world experiences and has historically failed to make ethical judgments.Human expertise ensures meticulous data review and validation to maintain an AI model’s consistency, accuracy and reliability. Humans evaluate, assess and interpret a model’s output to identify biases or mistakes and ensure they align with societal values and ethical standards.Moreover, human intelligence offers unique perspectives during data preparation by bringing contextual reference, common sense and logical reasoning to data interpretation. This helps to resolve ambiguous results, understand nuances, and solve problems for high-complexity AI model training.The symbiotic relationship between artificial and human intelligence is crucial to harnessing AI’s potential as a transformative technology without causing societal harm. A collaborative approach between man and machine helps unlock human intuition and creativity to build new AI algorithms and architectures for the public good.Decentralized networks could be the missing piece to finally solidify this relationship at a global scale.Companies lose time and resources when they have weak AI models that require constant refinement from staff data scientists and engineers. Using decentralized human intervention, companies can reduce costs and increase efficiency by distributing the evaluation process across a global network of data trainers and contributors.Decentralized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) makes AI model training a collaborative venture. Everyday users and domain specialists can contribute to training and receive financial incentives for accurate annotation, labeling, category segmentation and classification.A blockchain-based decentralized mechanism automates compensation as contributors receive rewards based on quantifiable AI model improvements rather than rigid quotas or benchmarks. Further, decentralized RLHF democratizes data and model training by involving people from diverse backgrounds, reducing structural bias, and enhancing general intelligence.According to a Gartner survey, companies will abandon over 60% of AI projects by 2026 due to the unavailability of AI-ready data. Therefore, human aptitude and competence are crucial for preparing AI training data if the industry wants to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.Data infrastructure for AI model training requires continuous improvement based on new and emerging data and use cases. Humans can ensure organizations maintain an AI-ready database through constant metadata management, observability and governance.Without human supervision, enterprises will fumble with the massive volume of data siloed across cloud and offshore data storage. Companies must adopt a “human-in-the-loop” approach to fine-tune data sets for building high-quality, performant and relevant AI models.Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at Sapien.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-26T14:47:14.000Z,"Veteran capital in crypto is shaping South Korea’s elections","Cryptocurrency has emerged as a defining issue in South Korea’s snap presidential election, with candidates vying for support from a growing base of digital asset investors across generations.All three front-runners have rolled out crypto-friendly proposals. These include the legalization of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the easing of banking rules that currently restrict fiat-to-crypto trading to just five platforms.The June 3 vote is slated to come around two years early, triggered by the impeachment of former president Yoon Suk-yeol after his controversial declaration of martial law in late 2024. Though quickly overturned by lawmakers, the abrupt power grab led to a political crisis and his eventual removal from office.Yoon’s 2022 campaign leaned heavily on promises to reform crypto regulations — largely aimed at younger voters. This time, the political focus on digital assets has only intensified, as older generations begin to pour significant wealth into digital assets.Three leading presidential candidates have promised pro-crypto policies.Presidential election debate clash on stablecoinsThis election has three leading candidates, and all of them have promised to advance the local crypto economy.Lee Jae-myung of the opposing Democratic Party lost to Yoon in the last election and returns with a second crypto-friendly campaign.Kim Moon-soo is running under the current ruling party, the People Power Party (PPP). Former president Yoon has distanced himself from the PPP ahead of the election, leaving Kim to define a new direction for the fractured conservative base.Lee Jun-seok was once the youngest-ever leader of the PPP. He is now leading his own newly formed Reform Party, a minor party he founded in January 2024 after splitting with the ruling bloc.“The political sphere has actively embraced [cryptocurrencies] as a key campaign agenda,” Park Sung-jun, head of the Blockchain Research Center at Dongguk University, told Cointelegraph.“Driven by the transition to a digital economy, the push for transparency in political funding, the spread of blockchain-based political participation technologies and growing demands for investor protection, [crypto] has emerged as a significant economic, social and political issue in South Korea.”Lee Jae-myung and Kim have both pledged to ease strict banking rules that require crypto exchanges to partner with licensed banks to offer fiat services — a system that has created a near-monopoly of just five approved platforms. The structure in place excludes corporate participation, as it requires users to open accounts at partner banks using their legal identities.Lee has also proposed launching a stablecoin pegged to the won to reduce reliance on tokens issued abroad.Related: South Korean crypto emerges from failed coup into crackdown seasonLee Jun-seok pushed back, noting that South Korea once had a won-pegged algorithmic stablecoin, TerraKRW (KRT), part of the Terra ecosystem that suffered a multibillion-dollar collapse.“Lee Jae-myung proposes launching another stablecoin without presenting any safeguards. What assets will back it? How will market risks be handled? How will we avoid repeating past failures? There are no answers,” Lee Jun-seok said in a Facebook post, criticizing his opponent for turning stablecoins into a “slogan.”The two candidates clashed again on stablecoins during a live debate, where Lee Jae-myung argued for the safety of centralized and fiat-backed stablecoins.Presidential candidates quiz each other on the difference between USDT and USDC. Source: National Election Broadcasting Debate CommissionLee Jae-myung was Yoon’s opponent in the 2022 election when he also championed crypto-friendly policies. However, he was less aggressive than Yoon, who made several pro-crypto pledges. Some of them, like lifting bans on play-to-earn (P2E) gaming and initial coin offerings, were never implemented.Lee Jun-seok reportedly called gaming South Korea’s “second semiconductor industry,” which made up more than a fifth of the country’s total exports in 2024. He pledged to target 10% of the global gaming market through regulatory support in taxation, exports and talent development.

2025-05-26T13:59:11.000Z,"10 red flags that scream ‘fake airdrop,’ and how to avoid them","Key takeawaysIn 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams targeting Hamster Kombat, Wall Street Pepe and others led to millions in user losses, contributing to over $9.9 billion in global crypto scam damages.Fake airdrops impersonate legitimate projects, tricking users into revealing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying upfront fees that lead to irreversible crypto theft.Warning signs include no official announcement, suspicious URLs, requests for private keys, grammar errors and unrealistic reward promises.Future airdrops are shifting toward activity-based, retroactive and AI-monitored models that reward genuine user engagement while reducing exploitation.While cryptocurrency airdrops are a legitimate way for projects to gain publicity and users, scammers exploit this hype, draining wallets through fake campaigns. In 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams around projects like Hamster Kombat and Wall Street Peepe cost victims millions. According to Chainalysis, the global estimated losses in 2024 from cryptocurrency scams and fraud, which included fake airdrops, amounted to at least $9.9 billion. Spotting red flags is crucial to staying safe from fake airdrops. This article explores key warning signs and practical tips to protect your funds. What are fake airdrops?Airdrops are a common practice of distributing free tokens in the crypto world as part of marketing campaigns, user acquisition efforts, or community-building exercises. Legitimate airdrops reward early takers, increase token visibility, or promote network activity. Getting airdrops requires minimal effort, like signing up, joining a community or holding a specific token.However, the popularity of airdrops has also drawn scammers. They exploit user greed and curiosity by promising free tokens (fake airdrops) in exchange for sensitive actions such as sharing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying gas fees. Fraudsters may impersonate real projects using spoofed domains or fake social media accounts.These scams often look convincing, and even experienced users can fall victim. This is the reason consistent vigilance is required when you are getting airdrops. Did you know? In 2023, Inferno Drainer helped scammers steal over $80 million through airdrop phishing campaigns. Operating as a “drainer-as-a-service,” it lets affiliates use prebuilt kits to run scam airdrop sites, targeting wallets across several blockchains.Key red flags that expose ‘fake airdrops’Before you connect for an airdrop, learn to spot the warning signs. These red flags are your first line of defense against losing your crypto or sensitive information to scammers:1. No official announcement from verified channelsWhat to watch for: A major warning sign of a fake airdrop is the lack of any announcement on the project’s official communication channels. Scammers often use unsolicited direct messages, unofficial Telegram groups or poorly crafted websites mimicking legitimate ones to promote fake airdrops.How to avoid: Always verify the legitimacy of an airdrop by checking the project’s official website, verified X account or official Discord/Telegram channels before clicking any links. If the airdrop isn’t mentioned there, keep away from it.2. Request for private key or seed phraseWhat to watch for: A critical red flag of a fake airdrop is a request to “verify” your wallet by providing your private key or seed phrase. These scams deceive users into surrendering complete control of their crypto wallets by posing as eligibility checks. Once shared, scammers can immediately steal all assets.How to avoid: Genuine airdrops never ask for your private key or recovery phrase, which should always remain confidential. If anyone or any website requests these, it is a clear scam. Exit the page immediately.3. Upfront gas fees or crypto paymentsWhat to watch for: A significant warning sign of a fake airdrop is that it requires upfront gas fees or cryptocurrency payments to “unlock” tokens. Scammers often insist you send Ether (ETH) or other coins to claim rewards, but after the payment, the promised tokens never materialize, and your funds are lost.How to avoid: Legitimate airdrops are free, typically involving only simple tasks like connecting a wallet or completing minor actions. If an airdrop demands any payment, it is likely to be a scam. Never send funds to unfamiliar addresses.4. Suspicious URLs or clone sitesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops frequently employ phishing websites resembling legitimate crypto platforms. These sites aim to deceive users into connecting wallets and signing fraudulent transactions.How to avoid: You need to carefully check a project’s URL before executing any transaction on it. There will likely be subtle differences, such as misspellings, extra characters or alternate domain extensions.Did you know? Some airdrops use retroactive criteria, rewarding users based on past activity. This encourages organic participation before the airdrop announcement, so simply using DApps naturally could make you eligible for future free tokens.5. Poor grammar and urgent languageWhat to watch for: Many fake airdrops feature poor grammar, spelling errors or aggressive phrases like “Claim Now Or Lose Out!” or “Final Chance For Free Tokens!” These tactics aim to create panic, rushing users into clicking malicious links without careful thought. Sloppy writing and intense urgency are clear signs of a scam.How to avoid: Legitimate crypto projects communicate professionally and clearly. If an airdrop announcement contains errors or uses high-pressure, time-sensitive language, steer clear. 6. Fake social proof or bot commentsWhat to watch for: Scammers frequently use fake airdrop posts filled with fabricated social proof, such as comments like “I just got 500 $XYZ!” or “Totally legit!” These are often posted by bots or fake accounts to create a false sense of trust and encourage participation. They might also use fake or hacked celebrity accounts to disseminate false information regarding airdrops.How to avoid: Avoid trusting social media comments alone to determine an airdrop’s legitimacy. Research the token thoroughly, confirm its presence on reputable platforms, and seek authentic user feedback on forums like Reddit or trusted crypto Discord groups. Genuine projects maintain transparent communities, not just artificial hype.7. Unknown or nonexistent token projectsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops promote tokens tied to obscure or nonexistent projects, which might lack a white paper, roadmap, official website or verifiable team. Scammers use these fabricated tokens to trick users into connecting wallets or approving transactions that result in stolen funds.How to avoid: Always research a token extensively before participating in an airdrop. Check for a white paper, official website, team credentials and active community presence. If the project lacks basic details or appears suspiciously new with no credible background, it is likely fraudulent.8. Token approval trapsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops entice users to connect their wallets and grant token spending permissions. These seemingly harmless “approval” requests can allow scammers to freely transfer or drain your tokens without further interaction, exploiting the granted permissions.How to avoid: Exercise caution when approving token transactions, particularly from unfamiliar sources. Avoid authorizing smart contract interactions on untrusted websites. Regularly use tools like revoke cash to check and cancel unnecessary token approvals.9. Redirects to malicious wallet drainersWhat to watch for: Some fake airdrop links redirect users to malicious DApps known as wallet drainers. These sites are designed to resemble legitimate claim pages but execute malicious smart contracts once a wallet is connected. By clicking “claim airdrop,” users unknowingly sign transactions that give scammers full access to their funds.How to avoid: Always review transaction pop-ups carefully before signing. Use browser wallets like MetaMask with built-in phishing protection and stay updated on known scam domains. If a site looks unfamiliar or triggers unexpected approvals, disconnect immediately. 10. Unrealistic reward promisesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops often attract users with unrealistic promises, such as “Instantly claim $2,000 in free tokens!” with no effort required. These offers exploit greed and curiosity, luring users into connecting wallets or signing transactions without proper scrutiny.How to avoid: Be suspicious of extravagant claims. Genuine airdrops usually provide modest rewards and have certain eligibility criteria. If an offer appears too good to be true, it is likely to be fraudulent.Did you know? In 2021, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) gave governance tokens via an airdrop to anyone who had registered a .eth name. Many ENS holders received thousands of dollars just for owning a crypto domain name.Examples of fake airdropsHere are some examples of well-known fake airdrops to help you understand how these fraudulent actions scam unsuspecting victims:Hamster KombatHamster Kombat is a Telegram-based tap-to-earn game where players manage a virtual crypto exchange as a hamster CEO. By tapping, completing daily tasks and upgrading, players earn HMSTR coins, which are convertible to tradable tokens. Launched in March 2024, it attracted over 250 million users, but scams targeting players have raised concerns.Malicious actors targeted Hamster Kombat to profit from the tap-to-earn game’s viral popularity. Kaspersky warned users about fake Hamster Kombat airdrops, meant to steal victims’ crypto wallet credentials.Wall Street PepeWall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is an Ethereum-based memecoin that combines meme culture with practical trading utilities. Inspired by the Pepe meme and Wall Street trading, $WEPE provides small traders with unique market insights, strategic analysis and a supportive community.The $WEPE airdrop scam mimicked the legitimate token's website. It lured users with promises of an airdrop and prompted them to connect their digital wallets, inadvertently signing malicious contracts that drained their assets.HEXHEX is a token built on Ethereum to help users capitalize on cryptocurrency market growth through a system that supports coin locking and staking for fixed durations. The fraudulent webpage replicated the official HEX site. The airdrop on this counterfeit site was fake and unrelated to the genuine HEX project or other initiatives. When a crypto wallet was linked to the deceptive site, it activated a malicious contract that enabled the cryptocurrency drainer to steal funds.SuiSui (SUI) is a layer-1 blockchain and smart-contract platform engineered for speed, privacy and accessibility, featuring a distinctive object-centric data model.When users checked airdrop eligibility on the fraudulent webpage posted by the scammers, they were prompted to link their digital wallets. This action unwittingly signed a malicious contract, enabling the cryptocurrency drainer. Consequently, their funds were automatically transferred to wallets controlled by scammers through seamless, unauthorized transactions.LayerZeroThe LayerZero airdrop implemented a novel \""proof-of-donation\"" claiming system. Instead of distributing $ZRO tokens for free, as typical airdrops do, LayerZero required users to donate $0.10 per token to the Protocol Guild, which supports Ethereum’s core developers.In July 2023, security firm CertiK cautioned users to be careful about fake airdrops being promoted on X by accounts impersonating Layer Zero. When users clicked on the links, they were sent to a website that resembled the official LayerZero website.How crypto airdrops are evolving from freebies to secure community rewardsCrypto airdrops are advancing beyond basic token giveaways, adopting more advanced and secure approaches to engage users. Projects increasingly implement activity-based airdrops, rewarding users for contributions like staking, testing apps or engaging in governance. This shift seeks to promote authentic community involvement and prevent exploitative tactics. Novel distribution models such as snapshot-based allocations and retroactive rewards are gaining traction. These approaches enhance transparency and ensure tokens reach active community contributors. Integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning improves fraud detection and strengthens airdrop security by helping detect bots, fake wallets and fraudulent behavior, making airdrops more secure and resistant to exploitation.This transformation reflects the evolution of responsible, effective token distribution practices that align with decentralization and community empowerment goals.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-26T13:12:20.000Z,"How to read Bitcoin candlestick charts (no experience needed)","Key takeawaysBitcoin candlesticks are a popular tool among Bitcoin traders because they’re simple to use and offer an intuitive way to understand market sentiment and trends.Bitcoin candlesticks are a rather old tool. Rice trader Honma Munehisa invented them in Japan as far back as the 18th century. They were introduced to Western financial markets in the late 1980s.They help you understand bullish and bearish patterns in technical analysis. This knowledge will get you started with Bitcoin trading.They should not be your only tool for making informed decisions. Combine them with other Bitcoin technical indicators, such as MAs (moving averages) or the RSI (relative strength index). If you’re new to Bitcoin (BTC) trading, you may wonder when to buy or sell. Candlestick charts, like bar or line graphs, have time on the horizontal axis, while the price data appears on the vertical axis. They provide a quick look at price movements when compared to other charts. You can quickly view the highest and lowest prices of an asset in a specific timeframe. It also shows the opening and closing prices. Here are a few Bitcoin trading tips to help you get started. No experience needed; this is your go-to crypto candlestick chart tutorial, perfectly suited for beginners.Why analyze Bitcoin price chartsTechnical analysis is an essential and consolidated strategy for trading markets. When Bitcoin (BTC) started picking up and prices fluctuated more, crypto investors began to use trading strategies from traditional markets, such as candlesticks. For Bitcoin technical analysis basics, platforms like TradingView offer many charts and technical indicators. These tools are easy to use, even for beginners. TradingView crypto charts can be candlestick, bar or line charts. Here’s an overview of candlestick charts to help you get started with Bitcoin trading.Beginner’s guide to Bitcoin candlestick chartsCandlestick charts are a milestone in technical analysis and the first step to understanding Bitcoin charts. They are an essential tool to quickly assess price movements and market trends in the short term. They represent Bitcoin’s price trends on a chart over a specific period, such as one hour, four hours or one day, to help traders make better decisions.Why use candlesticks? They help traders visualize price movements over time.They help identify bullish, bearish or consolidation sentiment.They help spot patterns like reversals or continuations to predict future price movements.A candlestick represents four key price points:The opening price at the start of the periodThe closing price at the end of the periodThe highest price reached during the periodThe lowest price reached during the period.A candlestick is formed of a body, the bulky part between the open and close prices. It is green when the price goes up in a bullish move, and the closing price is higher than the opening price. It is red when the closing price is lower than the opening price, so the price is in a bearish movement as it goes down.The body size shows strong buying and selling pressure when it’s long. It indicates uncertainty when it’s short. A candlestick also has wicks, or shadows. They are thin lines above and below the body that indicate the highest or lowest prices the asset hit during the relevant trading frame.Here’s a useful example that may help you understand it better. Suppose you’re analyzing the four-hour chart using candlesticks, and Bitcoin’s opening price is $90,000. The closing price is $93,500, with a high of $95,000 and a low of $88,700. In this instance, the candlestick will appear as a green body from $90,000 to $93,500. An upper wick hitting $95,000 and a lower wick dipping to $88,700.Advantages of Bitcoin candlestick chart Bitcoin candlestick charts offer several advantages, including:Candlestick charts offer you a quick view of market sentiment and price movement. They show if the market is positive or negative and how strong that feeling is. You can pick different timeframes based on your trading style, whether you’re a day trader, swing trader or long-term investor.For example, the one-minute chart works well for scalping, while the daily chart is better for long-term investors. As crypto markets are open 24 hours a day, the open and close prices reflect the start and end of the chosen timeframe.Introduction to advanced crypto charting techniques to trade BTCCandlesticks are a great way to start trading Bitcoin. They give you a quick look at market trends and help predict price movements. Once you know the basic charts and skills, you can explore advanced techniques. For example, using moving averages can help you make better investing decisions.Here are some of the best tools Bitcoin traders use to leverage technical analysis, volume and market psychology. These strategies give traders an edge in the ever-changing crypto market.1. Fibonacci retracement Fibonacci retracement is a technical analysis tool used to spot potential support and resistance levels, as well as price targets. To use this method, draw lines connecting a major high and low on the chart. Then, calculate retracement levels using Fibonacci ratios like 23.6%, 38.2%, 50% and 61.8%. You can use the Fibonacci retracement for confirmation when paired with trendlines or moving averages. 2. Volume profileVolume profile is another tool for technical analysis. It shows trading volume for price instead of time. Knowing where trading happens most helps traders spot key price levels. These levels often create strong support and resistance zones. 3. Elliot Wave TheoryThe Elliott Wave theory is a prediction model of price movements based on market psychology and wave patterns. According to the theory, the market moves in trends of five waves, followed by three waves of correction, with each wave reflecting trader sentiment.4. Other indicatorsThe relative strength index (RSI) is one of the most common charting indicators. It measures the strength of Bitcoin’s upward and downward price movements over time.The simple moving average (SMA) indicates the average price of an asset over time, which can help you understand Bitcoin’s overall price movement. The exponential moving average (EMA) is a better alternative to the SMA for identifying short-term trends. Like the SMA, the EMA shows you the average price of an asset over time, but the EMA focuses more on recent days.Caution! Reading Bitcoin candlesticks or any other charts is a great first step toward understanding market behavior, but remember charts don’t guarantee outcomes. Always combine technical insights with risk management, and never trade more than you can afford to lose.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

It’s also up by almost 20% over the last 30 days.Solana TVL.

Other major decentralized applications such as Jupiter DEX, Jito liquid staking, and Kamino Lending gained 12%, 25% and 11%, respectively.While Solana ranks the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, the Solana network is ahead of the other top layer-1 blockchains in terms of TVL, second only to Ethereum. Blockchain ranked by TVL, USD.

It is also larger than BNB Chain’s, which integrates seamlessly with Binance and Trust Wallet.Solana memecoin market cap gains 65%The rise in Solana’s TVL mirrors an increase in memecoin market capitalization as prices recovered across the board.Most Solana-based memecoins have posted double-digit daily losses in the weekly and monthly timeframes, as shown in the figure below.

It is completed when the price moves up to the resistance at the top of the V formation, also known as the neckline.SOL appears to be on a similar trajectory and now trades below a supply-demand zone between $180 and $200. A breakout here will increase the chances of the price rising to the neckline at $252 to complete the V-shaped pattern. Beyond that, the next target would be the all-time high above $295, representing a 66% increase from the current price.SOL/USD daily chart.

2025-05-26T12:07:07.000Z,"Hedera Africa Hackathon launches with $1M prize pool and Web3 focus","The Hashgraph Association and the Exponential Science Foundation have launched the Hedera Africa Hackathon 2025, a global event designed to accelerate Web3 and artificial intelligence adoption across the African continent. With a prize pool of $1 million, the hackathon will run from Aug. 1 to Sept. 30 and aims to attract over 10,000 participants across 15 African countries, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph.Organized by two nonprofit organizations — the Switzerland-based Hashgraph Association and the tech research-focused Exponential Science Foundation — the event is open to developers, students, and entrepreneurs worldwide.“We aim to use technologies that converge Web3 with AI to create transparent cognitive solutions that optimize processes and facilitate decision-making and automate the execution,” said Kamal Youssefi, the president of the board of directors at the Hashgraph Association.All solutions will be built on the Hedera network across four tracks: onchain finance and real-world asset (RWA) tokenisation; ESG sustainability and traceability; self-sovereign identity (SSI) and AI; and gaming, metaverse and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Up to 15 outstanding teams will receive prizes based on innovation, impact and alignment with the hackathon’s goals.Onsite hackathon map Source: Hedera-hackathon.hashgraphThis Hackathon covers large areas in Africa, with onsite events in over 20 African cities such as Lagos, Cairo, Nairobi, Kinshasa, Cape Town, Casablanca and Tunis.Interest in Africa’s Web3 potential is growing, with more than 50 partners and 100 universities and tech hubs having already joined the Hedera Africa Hackathon. Related: African economies show high potential for digital asset adoptionAfrica’s Web3 talents are poised for global impactDue to high inflation, a weak banking system and widespread corruption, many people in Africa lack access to reliable financial services. This creates opportunities for Web3 projects like Jambo and Yellow Card to offer alternatives for saving and earning.Related: South African firm chooses Bitcoin reserve strategy as inflation hedgeKamal highlighted Africa’s strength in its “young population with ambitious tech talents”. He cited Hedera’s partnership with Orange, a telecommunications operator, to launch digital empowerment programs across 16 African countries — initiatives that “include training, certification and the establishment of incubation and accelerator centers”.“Africa brings a unique advantage to Web3: a demographic edge and a proven capacity for digital adoption,” said Paolo Tasca, executive chairman of the Exponential Science Foundation. “Yet barriers remain, particularly in foundational infrastructure and education.”Governments are also ramping up talent development. Nigeria, for example, recently launched an annual initiative to train 1,000 citizens in artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies.

2025-05-26T11:51:44.000Z,"Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden’s cashless-society rethink","As Sweden reconsiders its push toward a cashless society, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin highlighted the fragility of centralized digital payments and the opportunity presented by decentralized payment alternatives. In recent years, Sweden has led the charge toward a cashless future, with digital payment platforms becoming widespread. However, as concerns over cyber-threats, civil defense and instability have emerged, Swedish authorities are now actively encouraging citizens to keep some cash. Buterin noted the reversal illustrates that while centralized solutions may be efficient, they may not be reliable during times of crisis. “Nordics are walking back the cashless society initiative because their centralized implementation of the concept is too fragile,” Buterin wrote, citing a March 16 article by The Guardian. “Cash turns out necessary as a backup.”Source: Vitalik ButerinHow Ethereum can play a role in a crisisA former central bank official predicted in 2018 that Sweden would be cashless after seven years. In 2025, the prediction mostly held, with only one in 10 transactions in the country being done in cash, according to The Guardian.Still, while the Nordic country was an early adopter of digital payments, its government published a brochure encouraging citizens to keep a week’s worth of cash in case of war or crisis. Sweden’s reconsideration has revealed the issue of centralized digital payment infrastructure remaining reliable in times of instability, Buterin suggested. Buterin said Ethereum can be a decentralized financial fallback in times of crisis. “Ethereum needs to be resilient enough, and private enough, to be able to credibly play this kind of role,” Buterin said. When asked if fully offline zero-knowledge technology-secured private transfers were close to practical implementation, Buterin said the tech know-how is already there, but there are still limitations: “We basically know how to do it, but with the limitation that any solution depends on trusted hardware and/or post hoc enforcement against double-spenders.” Related: Vitalik Buterin proposes partially stateless nodes for Ethereum scalingCrypto payments exec thinks crypto won’t replace fiatWhile crypto payment solutions are becoming more common, Mercuryo co-founder and CEO Petr Kozyakov has said that crypto will not replace fiat. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph in an interview that crypto payments are seeing an increase in demand and adoption. However, the executive said that instead of cryptocurrencies fully replacing fiat money as a payment method, the two payment options will coexist. Kozyakov told Cointelegraph that people will use crypto when it’s easier and more practical.Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-alternative-sweden-cashless-plans?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
