2025-05-28T13:49:07.000Z,"Japanese Tech Company Metaplanet Issuing Bonds to Buy Bitcoin! Here Are the Details","Tokyo-based technology company Metaplanet has made a new move in its aggressive Bitcoin investment strategy. The company announced the issuance of $50 million in zero-interest bonds. With this funding, the company plans to increase its Bitcoin (BTC) purchases. Metaplanet Issues $50 Million in Bonds to Increase Bitcoin Purchases This bond issuance is Metaplanet's 16th bond sale to date, according to the company's announcement in Japan on May 28, 2025. The bonds were all purchased by Cayman Islands-based investment firm Evo Fund, which has participated in Metaplanet’s previous bond sales and is one of the main institutional partners supporting the company’s long-term Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Following the bond issuance news, Metaplanet shares rose by 9.5% on the Japanese stock exchange. According to Yahoo Finance data, this increase reflects the company’s confidence in its BTC-focused strategy among investors. Metaplanet has been accumulating Bitcoin since April 2024 and aims to reach 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025. Last week, the company announced that it had purchased an additional 1,004 BTC for approximately $104 million. With this latest purchase, the firm’s total BTC holdings reached 7,800. Metaplanet’s new funding move comes as Bitcoin is trading near all-time highs. Last week, BTC rose to $111,889 on exchanges like Coinbase. At press time, BTC was trading sideways at $108,870. In the crypto markets, Metaplanet is often compared to US software company MicroStrategy for its aggressive BTC investment model. The company is the public company holding the most BTC in Asia and ranks 11th globally, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net data. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-28T13:48:45.000Z,"Here’s what happened in crypto today","Today in crypto, GameStop confirmed it has made its first Bitcoin investment, US Representative Bryan Steil told Cointelegraph he wants lawmakers to stop adding non-relevant clauses into crypto bills, and Trump Media confirmed a capital raise to buy Bitcoin after initially denying reports it was planning to do so. GameStop officially confirms first Bitcoin purchase of 4,710 BTC GameStop, the US video game and consumer electronics retailer, has confirmed its first Bitcoin investment , acquiring 4,710 Bitcoin, according to a statement posted May 28 on the company’s X account. The company did not specify how much it paid for the Bitcoin ( BTC ) or when the purchases were made in the announcement , while its Form 8-K filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission also offers little detail. The amount purchased was worth around $513 million at the time of writing. The announced acquisition is GameStop's first publicly acknowledged Bitcoin purchase since the company disclosed plans to move into Bitcoin investment in March. At the time, GameStop said it would fund the Bitcoin purchase through debt financing and launched a $1.3 billion convertible notes offering. Source: GameStop The news comes after months of speculation that GameStop was exploring alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies . Rep. Steil wants restraint on crypto bill additions Republican Representative Bryan Steil told Cointelegraph on May 27 that he wants lawmakers to stop adding what he considers are non-relevant clauses into two key crypto bills, claiming that doing so is slowing the implementation of a regulatory framework for the industry. “Individuals, when they see legislation that’s going to move forward, want to attach non-germane items to any bill that’s going to move through and be signed into law,” Steil, chair of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on crypto, told Cointelegraph at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Stable Coin and Market Structure legislation will unlock the golden age of digital assets. pic.twitter.com/lSbX5p2Wqt — Bryan Steil (@RepBryanSteil) May 27, 2025 “We have to restrain ourselves from that instinct and attempt by our colleagues — both sides of the aisle,” he added. Crypto backers in Congress hope to pass stablecoin and market structure bills before a month-long August recess, which was hampered by Democrats who pulled support for the stablecoin bill earlier in May over concerns about President Donald Trump’s crypto ventures. Steil argued the concerns related to Trump aren’t relevant to the bills, and the “text is focused on putting forward a regulatory framework in which we can enforce actions to strengthen this broader market.” Trump Media Group reverses stance, confirms $2.5 billion Bitcoin capital raise Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), the company that owns US President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform and is partially owned by the president, confirmed a $2.5 billion capital raise to purchase Bitcoin after denying earlier reports of the deal. According to a May 27 announcement from the company, the capital raise comprises a $1.5 billion stock sale and $1 billion in convertible senior secured bonds, with a 0% coupon. The sale is expected to close on May 29. TMTG CEO Devin Nunes said: “We view Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets. This investment will help defend our Company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions.\"" TMTG spokespeople responded to the initial report from the Financial Times, published a day before the announcement, with derision. “Apparently, the Financial Times has dumb writers listening to even dumber sources,” TMTG representatives told the FT on May 26.",cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-happened-in-crypto-today?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|LINK|LTC|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|ZEC|ZRX|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BNB|FDUSD|TON|USDC|ENA|BSV|ZK|WLD|OM|KAVA|BTG|ARKM","Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-05-28T13:48:01.000Z,"Bitcoin to $150K? Tom Lee Says the “Banana Zone” Is Coming","The post Bitcoin to $150K? Tom Lee Says the “Banana Zone” Is Coming appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is trading near $108,914.72 ( check live ), and the excitement is building. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee has made a bold prediction – he believes Bitcoin is heading toward $150,000 in this market cycle. Lee says Bitcoin is about to enter a “banana zone” – a phase of rapid price growth that could reshape the crypto market in 2025. So, what’s behind this bold forecast? Let’s break it down. What Is the “Banana Zone”? Lee’s outlook is based on an analysis shared by Julien Bittel , head of macro research at Global Macro Investor. Bittel’s chart tracks four major Bitcoin market cycles since 2011. Each cycle included two correction phases before entering a fast-growth period – what they call the “banana zone.” According to the chart, the current cycle began in 2022 and is now going through its first correction. If the pattern holds, Bitcoin could be gearing up for a major rally. This theory is already gaining traction. On May 22, Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $111,970 after the U.S. and China agreed to a 30-day trade war truce. Although the price later dropped to $78,000 due to institutional sell-offs, Lee sees that as part of the natural cycle and a setup for bigger gains ahead. Tom Lee’s Bold Forecast: $150K Is in Sight Speaking to CNBC earlier this year, Lee said he expects Bitcoin to pull back to $50,000–$60,000 before continuing its climb. He believes BTC could hit $150,000 in this market cycle. He also thinks Bitcoin could eventually rival gold as a top store of value, especially with growing interest from institutions. Adding more fuel to the fire, analyst Nick Hellmann recently predicted that Bitcoin could break $244,00, reminding his followers that he previously called the $100K mark correctly. Michael Saylor Embraces Bitcoin for Everyday Use At the Bitcoin 2025 conference, MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor made waves again. He met with Gemini founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who handed him the new Gemini Bitcoin Credit Card. Saylor posted a photo of the moment on X, captioned: “Bitcoin is money. Everything else is credit.” The credit card offers Bitcoin rewards on fiat purchases, aiming to make BTC part of everyday spending. Tyler Winklevoss even mentioned that the card includes a “ whale limit ” – a nod to MicroStrategy’s massive Bitcoin holdings Crypto’s Next Chapter: Are We There Yet? From bullish predictions to new tools for BTC adoption, momentum is building fast. With growing institutional interest, a more supportive U.S. government, and signs of a broader trend shift, Bitcoin could be heading into one of its biggest years yet. If the “banana zone” theory plays out, BTC may not just hit $150K – it could change the way we think about money in 2025.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-to-150k-tom-lee-says-the-banana-zone-is-coming/,"ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-05-28T13:45:37.000Z,"Why MicroStrategy Slows Down Its Bitcoin Purchase?","The post Why MicroStrategy Slows Down Its Bitcoin Purchase? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Strategy, formerly known as (MicroStrategy), the biggest corporate holder of Bitcoin has been long known for buying huge amounts of BTC, leading the way for other companies to join the Bitcoin wave. But in the past few weeks, things have slowed down for Strategy. Why is this happening? Is Strategy starting to lose money? Let’s dive in. Recent Purchases Show a Slower Pace According to K33’s Vetle Lunde, Strategy’s recent purchases are smaller than before. Between May 19 and May 25, the company bought 4,020 bitcoins for about $427 million. They used money from selling new MSTR shares but raised only $348.7 million this time, much less than the $705.7 million they raised the week before. Just a few months ago, they were raising over $2 billion each week to buy Bitcoin! Why Is Strategy Slowing Down? This slowdown has a few reasons. First, the price gap between MSTR’s stock and the actual value of its bitcoin holdings has gotten smaller. That means investors aren’t paying as much extra for MSTR shares anymore, making it harder for the company to raise big sums of money. Second, more companies are now jumping into the Bitcoin game. Over 70 firms, including big names like Metaplanet and Semler Scientific, have started using their treasuries to hold Bitcoin. Just this week, Trump Media and Technology Group also announced it’s holding Bitcoin in its treasury, backed by $2.5 billion from investors. All this new competition is giving people more choices, so MSTR doesn’t have the same edge it once did. Strategy Still Holds a Big Bitcoin Pile Even with the slowdown, Strategy still holds an impressive 580,250 BTC, worth over $63 billion at today’s prices. That’s about 2.75% of all Bitcoin out there! Meanwhile, on May 22, the company shared that it plans to sell its 10% Series A perpetual strife preferred stock for just $0.001 per share. This new sales agreement is expected to bring in a total of $2.1 billion over time through its ATM program. However, the company has recorded a massive $15 billion profit as Bitcoin reaches its highest price ever. If bitcoin holds steady, the company’s second-quarter earnings are expected to soar, says Capital strategist Jeff Walton.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-microstrategy-slows-down-its-bitcoin-purchase/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-05-28T13:45:15.000Z,"Coinbase consolidates Canadian expansion with Toronto FC and Argos deals","Coinbase has entered a multi-year collaboration with the Toronto Football Club and the Toronto Argonauts as part of its expanded Canadian market strategy. The cryptocurrency exchange will serve as the exclusive crypto exchange and wallet partner for both teams. The announcement comes despite facing challenges from a recent data breach that exposed sensitive information of nearly 70,000 customers and could cost up to $400 million in remediation. Coinbase targets Canadian sports fans through MLSE deal Coinbase has recognized a significant opportunity in the sports industry in Canada. According to recent data the exchange cited, 1.4 million Toronto FC and Argonauts supporters have engaged in active cryptocurrency trading in the previous 12 months, and 1.7 million of them are cryptocurrency owners. It expects to gain direct access to these communities through collaboration with Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment on a number of sports channels. As a result of the partnership, Coinbase is now both teams’ sole cryptocurrency exchange and wallet partner. The new lounge at Toronto’s BMO Field, fieldside LED signs for both teams’ home games, and jersey patches on Toronto Argonauts uniforms will all prominently display the exchange. About five million people in Canada own crypto, making up about 13% of the country’s total population. Because of this, the nation is a desirable market for Coinbase’s growth initiatives. The collaboration expands on Coinbase’s prior achievement as the 111th Grey Cup’s first cryptocurrency partner and the Canadian Football League. Multi-sport branding strategy spans CFL and MLS partnerships The focus of Coinbase’s Canadian expansion is on high-profile branding opportunities on Major League Soccer and the Canadian Football League platforms. Beyond physical branding, Coinbase plans digital activations across both teams’ social media platforms. This includes interactive games and contests designed to educate Canadian audiences about cryptocurrency. The company is also developing immersive fan experiences such as promotional nights and in-game activations. This Canadian sports initiative aligns with Coinbase’s broader athletic partnerships, which include relationships with the NBA, Aston Martin Aramco Formula One racing, and esports partnerships with Riot Games. The Toronto-focused partnerships are the latest steps in what Coinbase describes as bringing sports on-chain while connecting with established Canadian institutions. Financial implications of data breach still on the horizon Coinbase’s move into Canada comes on the heels of the exchange being in serious financial and reputational peril following a massive data breach that began in late December 2024 and was announced in May 2025. The breach exposed sensitive financial information and personal information of nearly 70,000 customers. This includes phone numbers, addresses, email, and masked Social Security numbers. The stolen data also included masked banking account numbers, government identification photos such as driver’s licenses and passports, account balances, and transaction records. Coinbase declined to pay the requested $20 million ransom to the attackers. Instead, it offered a $20 million reward for information pointing towards the arrest and conviction of the attackers. The firm is also working with law enforcement officials, such as the U.S. Department of Justice, who have begun an investigation into the hack. Coinbase has committed to refunding those customers who were tricked into sending money to attackers as a direct result of the hack.

However, the pullback appears to be yet another higher low, which keeps up the possibility of a breakout. In the past few days, institutions have been aggressively accumulating Bitcoin, while others have been raising funds to buy more, such as Statergy. With the bullish momentum refueling, the Bitcoin cohorts have again become active. The Bitcoin cohorts refer to groups within the network that are used to understand the trend patterns and economic behaviors related to BTC transactions. Woefully, the spending by the older BTC holders has hit a high. The Aggregate volume of 1-year to 5-year cohorts has surged above $4 billion, suggesting the older coins are on the move. The rise has been seen for the first time since February 2025, while the 3-year to 5-year cohort contributed $2.16 billion out of $4 billion, which is their second-largest outflow. While 2-3 cohorts and 1-2 years contribute $1.41 billion and $450 million, respectively. In recent times, the change in their positions has always triggered interim BTC peaks, be it in Q4 2024 or in February or May 2025. Now the question arises whether this is a bearish signal for Bitcoin. Seeing 1y to 5y BTC moving isn’t a red flag yet, as most of this appears to be institutional accumulation, but not actual dumping. The exchange netflows are negative, while ETF inflows sharply rise, indicating they could be buying. However, if these tokens hit the exchanges, one can expect a sharp move. Hence, the Bitcoin (BTC) price movement is required to be closely monitored for the next few days.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-og-wallets-are-back-on-the-move-will-this-push-the-btc-price-to-110k/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

Familiar doubters like gold bug Peter Schiff and economist Nouriel Roubini continue to predict a catastrophic ending for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, Bitcoin spent the year with record-breaking rallies behind renewed institutional uptake . It set a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22 and has been trading near that level since, teasing investors with the possibility of a new ceiling. Here are some of the boldest Bitcoin price predictions from the first half of 2025 (so far). Bitcoin has stormed back since dropping to 2025 lows of $76,300 in April. Source: CoinGecko 1. Adam Back says Bitcoin tops $1 million if US jumps in Blockstream CEO Adam Back said in November that Bitcoin could break $1 million “this cycle” if the US follows through with plans to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. In March, the White House did just that, though it has yet to be codified into law by Congress. The Bitcoin Reserve Act treats the world’s first blockchain-based cryptocurrency as a digital gold-style reserve asset, using coins seized from criminal cases. Back says the $1 million prediction is the minimum target if the stars align. Source: Adam Back US states have started laying the groundwork. New Hampshire broke the ice on May 6 by signing a Bitcoin reserve bill into law. Later in the month, Texas lawmakers advanced a bill to establish a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, backed by Governor Greg Abbott . Speaking with Cointelegraph Magazine , Back gave a 2025 price target of “a few hundred thousand” dollars, citing renewed retail demand once roughly $16 billion in FTX bankruptcy repayments re-enter the market. He added that he is confident many of those investors will cycle back into the crypto market to fuel the next big rally. 2. Smart money agrees on Bitcoin’s year-end target Several analysts have set $200,000 as their target for Bitcoin in 2025. Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets at Standard Chartered, has been one of the leading voices. Kendrick said in an email note seen by Cointelegraph that Bitcoin is expected to hit $120,000 in the first half of 2025 en route to $200,000 by year-end, fueled by the rise of stablecoins. Related: A Bitcoiner’s guide to South Africa’s Garden Route “The US Senate… voted 66-32 to advance the GENIUS Act,” Kendrick wrote in the email note. “The point of the stablecoin Act is that stablecoins will further legitimise the whole asset class. All boats will rise.” Standard Chartered is closely watching the growth of stablecoins as a potential catalyst for Bitcoin’s price rise. Source: Standard Chartered Research During a recent Chain Reaction X Spaces show hosted by Cointelegraph, other analysts weighed in with their 2025 outlooks. André Dragosch, head of European research at Bitwise, agreed with Kendrick’s $200,000 year-end target. Markus Thielen added that Bitcoin has historically moved in $16,000 price increments, placing its next key resistance around $122,000. Anthony Scaramucci, founder of SkyBridge Capital and former White House communications director, also recently set his year-end target at $200,000 in a media interview . 3. Novogratz eyes Bitcoin’s next price discovery range Former Goldman Sachs partner and Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz remains one of the most prominent Bitcoin bulls in finance.

Cathie Wood’s $1.5-million Bitcoin target Cathie Wood, CEO and chief investment officer of ARK Invest, set her bull case forecast for Bitcoin at $1.5 million by 2030 , which would require a compound annual growth rate of 58% over the next five years. In a YouTube video published in February, she cited rising institutional interest as the key driver. Wood and ARK Invest are known for placing high-conviction bets on disruptive technologies, including early investments in Tesla and Bitcoin. Wood also highlights stablecoins as a key player in rising blockchain-based economies.

2025-05-28T13:30:26.000Z,"Bitcoin Represents A False Hope And Regulatory Concerns For Trump Media & Technology Group","Summary Trump Media's $2.5B capital raise to buy Bitcoin doesn't address core business weaknesses or create lasting shareholder value. Management's plan to classify Bitcoin as cash or short-term investments violates GAAP and raises legal and accounting red flags. Shares remain extremely overvalued relative to peers, with user growth and monetization failing to justify the current market cap. Absent a massive Bitcoin rally, I see no upside for shareholders and maintain a 'strong sell' rating on DJT. May 27th was not a very good day for shareholders of Trump Media & Technology Group ( DJT ), the company that owns right-wing platform Truth Social. After news broke that management had decided to issue additional stock and convertible notes, shares of the business closed down 10.4%. Even though this transaction will bring a significant amount of liquidity to the company, it doesn't do anything to address its underlying problems. The objective is to use this cash to invest in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). This could work out well in the event that Bitcoin prices rise. But anybody who follows my work closely knows how bearish I am about that cryptocurrency. There are some other issues as well. For starters, management seems to be interested in classifying these Bitcoin holdings on the company's books in a way that currently violates accounting standards and would be at odds with the law. This is problematic in and of itself. On top of this, shares of Trump Media & Technology Group remain significantly overvalued as-is and are likely to fall further from where they are right now. For context, since I originally rated the company a ‘strong sell’ in April 2024, the stock has plummeted by 52.1%. That comes at a time when the S&P 500 is up 12.9%. Absent any scenario where Bitcoin prices skyrocket, I see this as just more noise and more evidence that management doesn't really have a solid strategy to grow the company and create lasting shareholder value. Due to these factors, I have no choice but to maintain the company as a ‘strong sell’. A big… and questionable… announcement Shares of Trump Media & Technology Group plummeted 10.4% on May 27th after management announced that it struck a deal to raise about $2.5 billion from a group of 50 institutional investors. This investment will take two forms. The largest chunk of the money, $1.5 billion, will come from the issuance of additional stock at a price of $25.72 per share. This implies 58.32 million shares, which on their own would dilute existing shareholders by 20.9%. On top of this, the firm is issuing another $1 billion of 0% convertible notes. These are senior secured notes that will be backed by the Bitcoin holdings that the company has on its books. There is the opportunity for the notes to be converted at a 35% premium to the price that the shares are being sold for. That would mean an effective price of $34.72 per share. If that comes to pass, it would mean further dilution because of the issuance of 28.80 million shares. For those who are bullish about Bitcoin, and who are also bullish about Trump Media & Technology Group, this development will be perceived in a positive light. In essence, management will use the proceeds from this transaction to create what it calls a Bitcoin treasury. This follows a previously announced special acquisition fund that I wrote about in the past. According to the press release, Chairman and CEO Devin Nunes said that, ‘We view Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets. Our first acquisition of a crown jewel asset, this investment will help defend our Company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions, which plague many Americans and US firms, and will create synergies for our subscription payments, a utility token, and other planned transactions across Truth Social and Truth+. It's a big step forward in the Company’s plans to evolve into a holding company by acquiring additional profit-generating, crown jewel assets consistent with America First principles’. This transaction really just signals to me that management doesn't really have a cohesive strategy for how to grow the business. The entire objective of the company at this point in time should be to grow its user base and improve monetization. This would result in network effects that could make this into a lasting firm. In my previous article about the company, I specifically mentioned that it seemed as though management was just looking to latch on to anything that might stick, with the hopes that it would turn out well. This sentiment was expressed after the company struck a deal with Crypto.com to speculate in cryptocurrency using ETFs on its Truth.Fi platform. That followed another strategy that involved its own Truth+ streaming operations that have since been launched on Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Android TV, Apple TV, and elsewhere. Obviously, if Bitcoin prices rise from here, there could be a positive outcome for shareholders. However, the company does face some other issues as well that are worth mentioning. The first thing that came to my mind was that the business seems intent on violating current accounting standards. In its press release, the company said that it will place Bitcoin on the company's balance sheet alongside existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. This is a big problem because Bitcoin is not, by definition, any of those things. According to current accounting standards in the US, cash includes currency that a company has, as well as things such as demand deposits with banks or other financial institutions. It can include other types of deposit-related accounts also. It also doesn't meet the definition of a cash equivalent. You see, cash equivalents are short term, highly liquid investments that have specific characteristics to them. For starters, they are ‘readily convertible to known amounts of cash’ and ‘so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates’. An example here would be a three-month U.S. Treasury bill. Even when you have an investment that has a short time remaining to it, if the original maturity was longer, such as three years, it still would not meet the definition of cash equivalent. Some might argue that Bitcoin would meet the cash equivalents definition because it is readily convertible to cash and because it's not really tied to interest rates. However, the highly volatile nature of it violates part of this rule. As such, it certainly wouldn't pass the muster of this test. When it comes to short-term investments, it doesn't meet that standard either . To meet the standard, it must be readily marketable, meaning that it can be sold on the public market quickly and without any meaningful loss from said sale. It must be intended to be converted into cash within a single year or within the company’s operating cycle. And it must meet the definition of a financial instrument, which has historically been a debt security, an equity security, or some sort of held-for-trading, available-for-sale, or held-to-maturity investment. But in order to meet the definition of a financial instrument, it has to give the owner a contractual claim to cash or some other financial asset. Bitcoin does none of that. The proper designation under GAAP regarding Bitcoin and other similar cryptocurrencies has been as indefinite-lived intangible assets. Specific examples here outside of cryptocurrency would be goodwill or trademarks. Each year, these must be tested for impairment. This also means that, should there be a plunge in Bitcoin and a subsequent increase in it, the value of Bitcoin on the company's books could end up being significantly understated. Indefinite lived intangible assets can be written down, or impaired, when their prices drop. But they cannot be adjusted upwards. So this is something investors should pay attention to. It's also worth noting that, under the Howey Test, Bitcoin is not considered a security because it fails two of those four prongs. While it does meet the first prong of involving an investment of money, and it also meets the prong of there being an expectation of buyers having a profit from it, it's not an investment in a common enterprise since there is no issuing entity, and it doesn't involve the efforts of others since it is a decentralized faux asset. The SEC and CFTC typically both recognize Bitcoin as a commodity , not an investment. So at the end of the day, the company is going to have difficulty classifying its investment in the way that it hopes to classify it. I suppose that if management puts the Bitcoin into some other structured entity like an ETF or trust, it might be able to include it under the short-term investments category. But that would only be applicable if the investment is intended to be liquidated in a year or less. In that case, any swings in valuation could be measured at fair value and record it as unrealized gains or losses, until such time that the firm finally cashes out of it and realizes said gains or losses. Shares remain insanely overvalued In my previous article about Trump Media & Technology Group, I also decided to value the company by looking at the implied enterprise value divided by the daily active users that the company has. Since then, I have seen an updated estimate that pegs the number of daily active users for the company at 2 million. That's above the 1.9 million estimate that I used in March of this year. Management doesn't report these figures, so we have to use these third-party estimates. Author - SEC EDGAR Data In that analysis, which you can see updated in the table above, the company is compared to other social platforms that are publicly traded. I have also included Twitter on the list since we know its ultimate value at the time that it was sold. If the company were to trade at the same enterprise value per daily active user as these other firms, you would be looking at a downside of between 50.5% and 63.7%. This is even after factoring in this new equity raise, but without factoring in the conversion of the $1 billion of convertible notes. Frankly, I doubt that those notes will ever get converted, given the share price appreciation that would be needed to make that possible. Author - SEC EDGAR Data In the event that Trump Media & Technology Group was achieving attractive growth, and showed evidence that it could generate significant revenue, profits, and cash flows, per user, then perhaps there could be some potential for the company. But in the chart below, you can see that the firm continues to lose significant amounts of cash and, in the most recent quarter alone, it generated revenue of only $821,200. That's enough revenue to buy two of the average homes in the US. It's nowhere near enough to justify an implied market capitalization, following this offering, of $6.43 billion. Author - SEC EDGAR Data Takeaway Based on all the data currently available, it seems to me as though the market reacted appropriately in response to this latest announcement by the management team at Trump Media & Technology Group. Unless you expect Bitcoin prices to skyrocket, I really don't see a way in which this benefits shareholders. The company remains drastically overpriced, and I believe that management's plans on how to classify the Bitcoin it intends to purchase are at odds with GAAP and U.S. law. This only furthers my view that the company deserves a ‘strong sell’ rating.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4790458-bitcoin-represents-false-hope-regulatory-concerns-for-trump-media-technology-group?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","BTC-USD|DJT",cryptocompare

Bitcoin Chart Analysis: A Triangle Break Looms Technically, the Bitcoin price prediction remains neutral in the short term. On the chart, BTC is consolidating around $108,966 in a symmetrical triangle on the 2-hour chart – a breakout is brewing. The price is holding above the 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $108,996, which serves as dynamic support. A bounce from this level, especially with a doji or spinning top candle, may be a bullish break. Fibonacci levels from $102,190 to $111,930 show a confluence zone at $108,209. A move above $109,631 (0.236 Fibonacci) could trigger a move to $111,935 and $113,300. BTC/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The MACD is neutral but poised for a bullish crossover, while the RSI is approaching overbought territory – be cautious of a potential fake breakout. If BTC breaks below the triangle’s lower trendline and support at $108,233 or $107,078, it could lead to a rapid decline to $105,905 or $102,190. The market is poised for a significant shift. Watch these levels closely. BTC Bull Token Presale Approaches $7.50M Mark as 65% APY Staking Draws Interest With BTC/USD dipping below $108,000, attention is shifting to altcoins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . So far, $6.38 million has been raised, with the next price jump approaching quickly. Bitcoin Rewards and Supply Reductions BTC Bull Token operates with a built-in system: the higher BTC’s price, the more BTC airdrops are distributed to token holders. Notably, presale participants receive priority. The system also features: Token burns every $50K BTC increase, reducing supply. Current token price at $0.002535 before the next bump. This approach aligns token value with BTC/USD’s price moves while maintaining scarcity through programmed burns. Staking Terms for Passive Returns – BTCBULL’s staking pool holds 1.62 billion tokens offering 65% APY, with: No lockup periods or fees. Full access to funds at any time. This structure appeals to investors seeking yield without complex requirements or the risk of illiquidity. Momentum Before the Cap Fills With nearly $1 million remaining in the presale, buyers are positioning early. The token’s mechanics, including BTC-tied rewards, supply adjustments, and staking options, are driving participation. Key figures: USDT raised : $6,520,678/ $7,505,377 Token price : $0.00253 BTCBULL offers a whopping ~65% APY on its Ethereum-based staking pool (currently holding 1.61B BTCBULL), with no lockups or withdrawal fees.

Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference on May 27 during a fireside chat with Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Sacks outlined a possible route for such an acquisition, though he admitted it wouldn’t be easy. “I can’t promise anything,” Sacks said. “But there is a pathway for the government to buy more Bitcoin if we can do it in a budget-neutral way.” That would mean identifying funding within existing programs that aren’t utilizing their allocations and redirecting those funds without imposing new taxes or worsening the fiscal deficit. He noted that gaining support from Treasury Secretary Scott Besson or Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick would be key. “If they can get excited about the idea and figure out how to fund it without adding to the debt, then we could potentially acquire more Bitcoin,” Sacks said. Bitcoin Reserve Program Has Presidential Backing According to Sacks, the potential for the government to increase its BTC holdings stems from a March 6 executive order which established the framework for a U.S. crypto reserve . The order permits the government to retain Bitcoin seized in criminal or civil proceedings and opens the door to new purchases—under strict budgetary conditions. “Specifically, the executive order allows for the acquisition of BTC as long as it’s done in a budget-neutral fashion,” Sacks emphasized. This means any new Bitcoin acquisition must be internally financed, not through public debt or taxation. Holdings Under Review As of April, the U.S. government holds around 198,012 Bitcoin, worth over $21 billion at current market prices. Much of this stash was acquired through high-profile seizures: 69,370 BTC from the Silk Road bust in 2020, 51,351 BTC in a separate 2022 seizure, and 94,636 BTC from the Bitfinex hack linked to Ilya Lichtenstein . In January, the Department of Justice received approval to sell 198,109 Bitcoin. This follows a March 2023 sale of 9,861 BTC for $215.7 million. Whether the government decides to sell, hold, or buy more will now depend on the evolving fiscal strategy.

With his current bet nearing the liquidation threshold, Wynn now stands on the brink of losing the principal tied to that position as well. According to reporting by EmberCN , Wynn made $11.67 million by going long on Trump ( TRUMP ) and Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ) between May 12–13. However, on May 23, he lost $5.29 million through long positions in Ethereum ( ETH ) and Sui ( SUI ). A brief rebound followed on May 24, when longs on Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Pepe ( PEPE ) netted him a $42.08 million profit. But the gains were again eroded between May 25–27, as shorting BTC and longing PEPE led to a $16.72 million loss. At press time, Wynn’s open BTC long position has already incurred an unrealized PnL of $718,098. He is currently long 1,840 BTC with 40x leverage—valued at $200,347,340. The position was opened at $109,228, and his liquidation price stands at $102,257, putting his principal at risk if the market moves further against him.

Data from CryptoSlam shows that May’s NFT sales climbed to $430 million, up from $373 million in April, a 15% increase. It marks the first monthly sales increase this year, suggesting renewed interest in digital collectibles. This follows a five-month decline in sales since volume peaked at over $900 million in December 2024. May also had the highest number of transactions in 2025, reaching 5.5 million, according to CryptoSlam. The sales uptick may be attributed to the divergence between unique NFT buyers and NFT sellers. NFT buyers continued to increase in May, while sellers declined. Chart compiled by Cointelegraph to demonstrate CryptoSlam data on NFT monthly sales. Source: Cointelegraph NFT sellers dwindle, while buyers increase May showed a significant jump in unique buyers. The number of users buying NFTs rose by 50% to over 936,000 in May, up from around 622,000 in April. May’s figures are the largest buyer count since October 2024, hinting at growing investor participation during the month. While buyers increased, the number of unique sellers continued to decline. In May, NFT sellers fell to around 284,600, the lowest amount recorded on the CryptoSlam platform since April 2021. The divergence between the growing buyer interest and shrinking seller activity could set the stage for more competitive bidding, which may lead to higher valuations.

Despite the bullish sentiment, the strategist told Cointelegraph that the NFT comeback might not be similar to the space’s 2021 or 2022 peak. “Don’t expect a repeat of the 21/22 euphoria that we saw in NFTs,” Petscher said. Meanwhile, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a May 27 report that the sector needs new catalysts to fully rebound.

With bullish market structure still intact, a breakout toward $114,000 may be imminent if volume expansion confirms direction. Bitcoin ( BTC ) price action has spent the majority of the week consolidating in a tight, low-volatility range. Despite the calm, price remains firmly above a critical support level at $106,420. This zone was recently retested and held, reaffirming its importance in the current trend. While many traders are watching for a clear breakout, the underlying market structure still favors the bulls as price prints higher highs and higher lows. Key technical points $106,420 Support Level: Recently retested and holding, providing structural integrity to the current uptrend. Bullish Trading Channel: Price appears to be consolidating at the lower boundary, hinting at possible trend continuation. $114,000 Fibonacci Target: The next major upside level, derived from Fibonacci projections based on recent swing structure. BTCUSDT (1H) Chart, Source: TradingView Volume has noticeably contracted as price coils tightly around support. This type of price behavior, where volatility and volume drop together, often precedes a breakout. From a technical perspective, contraction leads to expansion. As Bitcoin trades in this compression zone, the breakout direction becomes the next key signal. Importantly, the bias still leans bullish. Price has yet to break any structural higher lows, and the overall trend continues to point upward. This consolidation phase may simply represent Bitcoin forming a higher low within the larger bullish trend. If volume enters the market and breaks the current resistance range cleanly, the path toward the $114,000 Fibonacci extension becomes much clearer. You might also like: Toncoin jumps 6% as BlackRock reportedly eyes Telegram’s $1.5b bond offering Additionally, the lack of strong selling pressure further supports the bullish case. While price is resting at the channel support, there has been no breakdown or impulsive bearish move. This suggests that buyers are still in control, and any decline in price is likely being absorbed at key levels. That said, any breakout, bullish or bearish, must be confirmed with a noticeable surge in volume. A breakout without volume may fail to sustain momentum, while a volume-backed move would likely trigger a strong continuation in the direction of the break. What to expect in the coming price action Bitcoin is at a key inflection point. If it holds above $106,420 and volume spikes, expect a bullish breakout toward the $114,000 Fibonacci target.

2025-05-28T13:00:19.000Z,"Bitcoin Hits New Heights: Analyst Predicts Next Peak By Late 2025","As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to capture investor enthusiasm, recently reaching a new all-time high of nearly $112,000, crypto analyst Cyclop has shared intriguing forecasts regarding the cryptocurrency’s future performance. Will Bitcoin Break Its All-Time Highs Again In a post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Cyclop projected that Bitcoin’s next peak is expected between November and December 2025, with the bull market concluding around February to March 2026. Additionally, he anticipates an altcoin rally during the summer and fall of 2025. Related Reading: Here’s Why Hyperliquid Hit New ATH At $39 And Why It Could Continue Cyclop elaborated on the cyclical nature of cryptocurrency markets, noting that while many investors are excited, only a small percentage typically profit. The analyst attributed this discrepancy to what he calls “crowd manipulation,” where the majority of investors often misinterpret market signals, believing it’s either too late or too early to invest. The Impact Of Halving Events To provide clarity on market cycles, Cyclop referenced historical data, highlighting previous Bitcoin cycle highs: $1,242 in November 2013, $19,891 in December 2017, and $69,000 in November 2021. The analyst pointed out that in both the 2017 and 2021 bull markets, peaks occurred exactly 29 months before Bitcoin’s Halving events, a pattern that repeats with remarkable consistency. Moreover, he analyzed the duration and severity of bear markets, noting that the downturns in 2018 and 2022 lasted exactly 12 months, with retracements of 84% and 77%, respectively. These similarities suggest that while each cycle may exhibit minor variations, the overarching patterns remain largely unchanged. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price Could Shoot To $12 Soon Cyclop also observed that Bitcoin has historically broken its all-time highs seven to eight months following halving events, a trend that continued in the latest cycle. Despite numerous changes in the cryptocurrency landscape, such as increasing mass adoption and evolving macroeconomic conditions, the expected bull run for this cycle appears to be extending slightly longer than its predecessors, with the peak anticipated in late 2025. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $108,600, marking a modest 3% decline from its all-time high of $111,800, which was reached last week. Year-to-date, the market’s leading cryptocurrency has gained 56%, trailing only XRP, which has gained 337% in the same period. Since Thursday’s peak, BTC retraced to the $106,700 mark, but it has since attempted to consolidate between $108,500 and $109,000, potentially moving toward new highs. However, the $110,000 level could act as a new resistance wall for the Bitcoin price, as many traders see an opportunity to short the asset, expecting further pullbacks that will allow them to liquidate late long positions. It remains to be seen how BTC’s price will perform in the coming days, as this new stage of price discovery could introduce volatility for market investors and perhaps allow altcoins to flourish.

2025-05-28T12:50:33.000Z,"Ethereum price stalls as whales sell $530M coins: can it surge to $4,000?","Ethereum’s price has stalled this week after hitting a crucial resistance level, as on-chain data points to whale selling and declining social traction. Ethereum ( ETH ) was trading at $2,650 on Wednesday, May 28, a few points below the crucial barrier at $2,722. It remains 91% above the lowest level this year. Santiment data shows that whales have started capitulating, as their holdings fell by 200,000 coins, equivalent to $530 million. They now hold 103.52 million coins, down from 103.74 million on May 24. Ethereum’s social volume has also dropped to 476, down from this month’s high of 3,060. Falling social volume suggests that traders are not actively discussing ETH on top platforms like Telegram and X. In most cases, cryptocurrency prices rise when there are active discussions on social media. Ethereum whales and social volume | Source: Santiment Ethereum’s network is facing other challenges, particularly from its layer-2 networks. Data from growthepie , a data and insights provider across Ethereum Layer 1 and Layer 2 network, shows it had 415,000 active addresses on Tuesday, much lower than Base’s 1.93 million and Celo’s 486,000.

Base paid $112,000 in the last 30 days, down 57% from a month earlier. Arbitrum One and Optimism paid $39,000 and $13,000 respectively, both down by double digits. On the positive side, there are signs that U.S. investors are moving back into Ethereum ETFs. These funds have seen positive inflows for three consecutive weeks and are up $38 million so far this week. This increase has brought cumulative inflows to $2.8 billion, bringing total assets to $9.60 billion. Ethereum price technical analysis ETH price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that ETH price has stalled in recent weeks after finding resistance at $2,722. It has failed to break above that level, which coincides with the 50% Fibonacci retracement point, at least three times. Ethereum has formed a bullish flag-like pattern, comprising a vertical move followed by some consolidation. It is also close to forming a golden cross pattern, as the spread between the 50-day and 200-day moving averages continues to narrow. A break above the 50% retracement would point to further upside, with the next major resistance at $3,000. A move above $3,000 would raise the odds of Ethereum rallying toward the psychological level of $4,000. A drop below the support at $2,333 would invalidate the bullish outlook.

2025-05-28T12:50:28.000Z,"Bitcoin Holders Unlock Billions: On-Chain Data Reveals Surprising Activity Surge","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Holders Unlock Billions: On-Chain Data Reveals Surprising Activity Surge A fascinating shift is happening within the Bitcoin ecosystem, according to recent insights from leading on-chain analysis firm, Glassnode. Their latest report highlights a significant increase in activity from a specific cohort of investors – those who have held their Bitcoin for a considerable time, specifically between one and five years. This group, often referred to as long-term holders, has recently moved a substantial amount of BTC, sparking discussions across the crypto community. What Does the Latest On-Chain Data Reveal? Glassnode shared key findings on X, pointing out that spending by long-term Bitcoin (BTC) holders is showing a notable uptick. The data indicates that holders within the one to five year age band collectively moved a staggering $4.02 billion worth of BTC. This figure represents the highest volume of movement from this particular cohort since February of this year. This surge in BTC spending by these seasoned holders is particularly interesting because the 1-5 year age band often includes investors who acquired Bitcoin during previous market cycles, holding through periods of both significant gains and downturns. Their decision to move such a large volume of coins suggests a change in behavior compared to typical ‘HODLing’ (holding on for dear life), which has been a dominant strategy for many in this group. Understanding on-chain data is crucial here. On-chain analysis involves examining publicly available data on the Bitcoin blockchain, such as transaction volumes, wallet addresses, and holder behavior patterns. Firms like Glassnode specialize in processing this vast amount of information to provide insights into market dynamics that are not visible through price charts alone. The movement of coins, especially those that have been dormant for years, can signal shifts in investor sentiment, supply dynamics, and potential future market direction. Why Are Long-Term Holders Increasing BTC Spending? The increase in activity from this cohort prompts the question: what’s driving these long-term holders to move their Bitcoin now? Several factors could be at play, and interpreting on-chain data requires considering the broader market context. Profit-Taking: After holding for one to five years, many of these coins were likely acquired at significantly lower prices than current market levels. A rally in Bitcoin’s price could incentivize some holders to realize profits, either partially or fully. Portfolio Rebalancing: Investors may be rebalancing their portfolios, potentially rotating out of Bitcoin into other assets, or simply moving BTC to different wallets or platforms for various reasons (e.g., security, accessing DeFi protocols, preparing for potential spending). Increased Utility: As the Bitcoin ecosystem evolves, there might be more opportunities for holders to use their BTC directly for purchases, investments in decentralized finance (DeFi), or other services, reducing the need to hold static balances. Market Sentiment and Outlook: A belief that the market may be nearing a peak, or conversely, positioning for further upside by moving coins to exchanges for quicker reaction times, could also influence this behavior. It’s important to note that ‘spending’ in this context doesn’t necessarily mean selling on an exchange. It simply means the coins have moved from the address where they were held for 1-5 years. This movement could be to an exchange, a new cold storage wallet, a DeFi protocol, or even to a payment processor. The destination of the coins provides further clues, which Glassnode’s detailed reports often explore. How Does This Activity Impact Crypto Market Dynamics? Increased BTC spending by long-term holders can have several implications for overall crypto market activity . Firstly, it can increase the available supply on exchanges if the movement is directed there. A significant increase in exchange supply, especially if met with insufficient demand, could potentially put downward pressure on prices. However, if demand remains strong or increases, this supply can be absorbed without a major price drop. Secondly, the behavior of long-term holders is often seen as a key indicator of market sentiment at different stages of a cycle. Historically, significant selling by the oldest cohorts (5+ years) has sometimes coincided with market tops, while accumulation by these groups can signal conviction during downturns. The 1-5 year cohort sits in a middle ground, representing a large segment of experienced investors whose movements are closely watched. Thirdly, this activity contributes to overall market liquidity and volume. Higher transaction volumes can attract more traders and investors, potentially increasing market dynamism and volatility. Interpreting the Signals: Challenges and Nuances While on-chain data provides invaluable insights, it’s not a crystal ball. Interpreting the movement of long-term holders comes with challenges: Motivation Ambiguity: As mentioned, ‘spending’ doesn’t specify the intent (selling, rebalancing, using). Without knowing the destination and context of each transaction, the exact motivation remains speculative. Cohort Specificity: The 1-5 year cohort is broad. Behavior within this group can vary widely based on individual entry points, investment goals, and risk tolerance. Correlation vs. Causation: While increased long-term holder activity might correlate with certain market events, it doesn’t necessarily cause them directly. It’s one data point among many influencing the complex crypto market activity . Data Lag: On-chain data is real-time, but analysis and interpretation can take time, and the market might react before the full implications of the data are widely understood. Therefore, this report from Glassnode should be viewed as a significant piece of the puzzle, prompting further investigation and consideration alongside other market indicators. Actionable Insights for Investors What can investors glean from this increase in BTC spending by the 1-5 year holder cohort? Monitor On-Chain Metrics: Pay attention to reports from firms like Glassnode and others specializing in on-chain analysis. Metrics related to holder behavior, exchange flows, and transaction volumes can provide valuable context. Understand Holder Behavior: Recognize that different holder cohorts (short-term, mid-term, long-term) tend to behave differently throughout market cycles. Understanding these patterns can help anticipate potential supply and demand shifts. Consider the Broader Context: Don’t rely on a single data point. Evaluate the long-term holder activity in conjunction with price action, macroeconomic factors, news events, and other technical and fundamental indicators. Assess Your Own Strategy: Reflect on your own investment timeline and goals. Are you a long-term holder? How does your strategy align with potential shifts indicated by aggregate holder behavior? This data can inform your decisions but shouldn’t dictate them in isolation. The fact that $4.02 billion in Bitcoin held for 1-5 years has moved is a material event that warrants attention. It signifies that a substantial amount of previously dormant supply is now active, adding a new dynamic to the market landscape. Summary: A Shift in Long-Term Holder Behavior Glassnode’s recent report highlights a significant development in the Bitcoin market: the highest level of BTC spending from the 1-5 year holder cohort since February, totaling $4.02 billion. This increased activity by experienced, long-term holders is a key piece of on-chain data that signals a potential shift in behavior from pure accumulation to distribution or re-allocation. While the exact motivations behind these movements require deeper analysis (are coins going to exchanges, cold storage, or elsewhere?), the sheer volume indicates that a substantial amount of previously illiquid supply is now in motion. This development adds a new layer of complexity to the current crypto market activity and underscores the importance of monitoring on-chain metrics to gain a more comprehensive understanding of underlying market dynamics.

At this point, the company, which issues bonds to buy more Bitcoin, continues to make regular BTC purchases. While MicroStrategy attracts attention with its Bitcoin strategy, Canadian investment company SOL Strategies attracts attention with its Solana (SOL) strategy. SOL Strategies, which has made a name for itself with its Solana acquisitions, has announced a new $1 billion move to buy more SOL. The company announced that it has filed a preliminary prospectus with Canadian securities regulators to issue up to $1 billion in securities over the next 25 months. Once the prospectus is approved, SOL Strategies will be able to issue various financial instruments and raise up to $1 billion without repeating the prospectus process each time. The company plans to use shares, warrants, subscription receipts, debentures or a combination of these to raise funds. At this point, SOL Strategies stated that it plans to invest more in the Solana network in the future by leveraging the capital markets. Leah Wald, CEO of SOL Strategies, said: “Our latest move supports our growth strategy by providing flexibility to access capital as future opportunities arise in the rapidly evolving Solana ecosystem. This strategic move enhances our ability to act decisively and quickly when attractive investment opportunities arise.” SOL Strategies announced in late April that it had secured $500 million in convertible notes to purchase more SOL. At that point, the company said it had signed a $500 million deal with New York-based investment firm ATW Partners. Sol Strategies noted that the deal with ATW Partners is the first of its kind and the largest in the Solana ecosystem.

The purchase was worth approximately $519 million, with each BTC valued at $109,728 at the time. The stock was higher by more than 3% ahead of Thursday’s opening bell. GameStop has purchased 4,710 Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/gGdr0BRrAv — GameStop (@gamestop) May 28, 2025 The news followed the company’s completion of a $1.5 billion convertible of senior notes on April 1. The sale aimed to leverage GameStop’s memecoin status to buy Bitcoin and boost its share price and appeal to investors. This wasn’t the first time the video game retailer bought Bitcoin. On March 25, GameStop approved a plan to convert a portion of its $4.77 billion in cash reserves into Bitcoin. However, it did not disclose how much of the reserves would be converted. Can Bitcoin save GameStop? The latest move into Bitcoin appears to be an attempt by GameStop to rescue its struggling business by emulating Michael Saylor’s strategy. Back in February, GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen posted a picture with Saylor, a gesture many traders saw as a signal of the company’s Bitcoin pivot.

GameStop is just one of the companies that is trying to copy Saylor’s Strategy in an effort to boost its stock valuation.

GameStop’s strategic shift into crypto assets GameStop’s decision to acquire BTC reflects not only a diversification of its investment portfolio but also a signal of confidence in the long-term viability of cryptocurrencies. While the exact value of the purchase was not disclosed, analysts view this acquisition as a strategic step by a firm that has historically been quick to pivot during periods of market disruption. At the current price of BTC at around $108,000, the holding is worth over $500 million. Transitioning into crypto holdings could bolster GameStop’s asset mix as it continues efforts to modernise and reposition its business model for digital relevance. Notably, the BTC purchase follows an earlier announcement by the company to update its investment policy to add Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. GameStop’s financial position From a financial standpoint, GameStop currently maintains a healthy balance sheet, with more cash than debt, giving it the flexibility to explore unconventional yet potentially rewarding investments. According to InvestingPro data , the company holds a current ratio of 8.05, highlighting strong liquidity and operational efficiency. Such a position enables GameStop to make aggressive financial decisions like investing in Bitcoin without undermining its core operations. Moreover, the company’s recent stock performance reflects growing investor confidence, with the share price delivering a 24.81% return over the past week alone. In addition, the Bitcoin purchase comes shortly after GameStop announced the pricing of $1.3 billion in convertible senior notes due in 2030. These notes, carrying a 0.00% interest rate, are convertible into Class A common stock and are expected to provide funding for general corporate purposes, including crypto investments. This financial manoeuvre illustrates GameStop’s intent to access capital while minimising debt servicing costs, positioning itself for future innovation. Additionally, analysts at Wedbush Securities raised their stock target for GameStop to $13.50, maintaining an “Outperform” rating and citing the notes offering as a key reason. But despite the market optimism, GameStop faces challenges on other fronts, including a lawsuit involving CEO Ryan Cohen over alleged improper profits from Bed Bath & Beyond trades. The suit claims Cohen and RC Ventures made $47.2 million in profits from so-called “short-swing” trades, potentially requiring repayment. At the same itme, GameStop Canada is undergoing a significant transformation by reverting to its former EB Games branding under new ownership by Stephan Tetrault. This rebranding effort is designed to breathe new life into the Canadian market and create a stronger customer experience across the region.

2025-05-28T12:38:34.000Z,"Bitcoin stalls below $110,000 as macro events weigh on momentum","Bitcoin’s price action has remained muted for over a week, stuck below the $110,000 mark since May 23. After a strong first half of the year, the world’s largest cryptocurrency is now moving sideways, trapped within a narrow band of $106,600 to $110,700. Bitcoin is struggling to establish a clear upward trend, with each attempt to break past $110,000 being rejected.

Fed uncertainty, tariffs, and inflation weigh on investor mood Bitcoin’s flat performance is also being shaped by broader economic uncertainty. Investors are closely watching macro data releases and monetary policy signals. The Federal Reserve’s latest meeting minutes, released this week, are under scrutiny for any hint on future interest rate movements. While the Fed left rates unchanged on May 7, Fed Chair Jerome Powell flagged tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump as a potential source of inflation and unpredictability. This comes ahead of a string of key economic data. The first revision of the Q1 GDP print is due before May ends, alongside the April Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index and jobless claims data on May 29. With rising bond yields already rattling traditional markets, crypto is seeing cautious sentiment carry over. Adding to the cautious tone is the broader market’s correlation with tech stocks. Nvidia’s earnings report, expected later this week, could sway investor sentiment significantly. A negative earnings surprise may not only hit equities but could extend risk-off behaviour into digital assets like Bitcoin. Trump effect and 2025 Bitcoin conference create volatility memories Another factor influencing trader positioning is the ongoing Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. While such events usually draw attention to the crypto sector, this year’s edition is being watched more closely due to the participation of Trump family members. Historical patterns show a link between high-profile Trump appearances and increased Bitcoin volatility. QCP Capital reminded investors in a Telegram note on May 27 of the sharp 30% drop in Bitcoin following Donald Trump’s keynote at the 2024 Nashville event. At the time, 1-day implied volatility surged above 90 before quickly reversing. Though the firm sees the likelihood of a similar plunge as low this time, it noted that market memory of the July 2024 event is still influencing cautious positioning. Key support zones build as liquidity clusters grow Traders are now closely watching the key levels just below current price action.

This notable update , highlighted by prominent crypto commentator Xaif, drew attention to Grayscale’s evolving approach to digital asset classification and its implications for the broader market. Grayscale’s latest taxonomy update not only reaffirms XRP’s role as a true digital currency but also introduces the AI sector as a formal new category within the crypto ecosystem. This dual development reflects Grayscale’s forward-thinking strategy to capture both established and emerging trends shaping the next generation of blockchain innovation.

Designed as a fast, efficient bridge currency for cross-border payments, XRP has been at the center of one of crypto’s most high-profile regulatory battles: the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple Labs, the company most closely associated with XRP. However, in 2023, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres issued a landmark ruling that declared XRP’s sales on public exchanges do not constitute securities transactions, significantly strengthening XRP’s legal and market position. Now, Grayscale’s decision to group XRP alongside Bitcoin in its “Currencies” classification delivers another powerful signal to institutional investors and the market at large. By emphasizing XRP’s role as a currency, Grayscale is highlighting its primary purpose: enabling fast and affordable cross-border transactions. This added layer of institutional recognition is poised to boost confidence among investors, particularly those who had remained on the sidelines amid the regulatory uncertainties. The AI Sector Officially Enters the Crypto Map While XRP’s inclusion is certainly noteworthy, Grayscale’s formal addition of an AI sector to its crypto taxonomy is arguably even more forward-looking. Over the past two years, artificial intelligence has surged to the forefront of innovation, transforming industries from healthcare to finance. AI’s integration is giving rise to a new generation of decentralized applications, predictive models, AI-powered marketplaces, and generative tools — all built on blockchain foundations. Grayscale’s recognition of AI as a distinct investment category signals that the convergence of these two cutting-edge technologies is no longer just experimental; it’s a rising force poised to reshape the digital asset landscape. For investors, this creates fresh opportunities to gain exposure to projects at the intersection of AI and crypto, a space many believe could define the next decade of technological progress. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Grayscale’s Influence on Market Narratives It’s important to understand that Grayscale isn’t just another player in the crypto market — it’s a market-shaping force. With billions in assets under management and some of the most widely tracked investment products in the space, Grayscale’s portfolio strategies and classifications carry substantial weight. By placing XRP shoulder-to-shoulder with Bitcoin in the “Currencies” segment, Grayscale effectively cements XRP’s role as a foundational asset within the digital economy. Simultaneously, by opening the door to an AI sector, the firm is signaling to both institutional and retail investors that it’s ready to embrace the innovations driving the next wave of crypto adoption. What This Means for Investors For crypto investors watching Grayscale’s moves, there are two key takeaways. First, the reaffirmation of XRP’s status as a currency helps remove lingering doubts about its investment thesis, paving the way for renewed institutional interest. The formal recognition of the AI sector provides investors with a guide to navigate the expanding landscape of crypto projects that utilize artificial intelligence. As Xaif’s coverage underscores, Grayscale’s taxonomy updates are more than just internal housekeeping — they’re signals to the market about where institutional capital and attention are likely to flow next. In an industry where narratives can shift overnight, staying attuned to these institutional signals is essential. As Grayscale continues to evolve its classifications in response to regulatory developments and technological advancements, the crypto landscape can expect further refinement and growth. With XRP gaining fresh validation and AI carving out its place on the crypto map, the stage is set for a new chapter in the evolution of digital assets — one where innovation, utility, and institutional confidence increasingly go hand in hand.

2025-05-28T12:30:34.000Z,"Adam Back calls the beginning of Bitcoin's institutional adoption era","Blockstream CEO Adam Back believes Bitcoin institutional adoption is already here. He argued that cryptocurrency adoption takes time to mature because digital assets develop product playbooks and training. Back also revealed that stablecoins have provided a better banking experience in wire transfers and banking. He noted that stablecoins have enabled 24/7 banking and wire transfers through the weekends. Blockstream’s executive also argued that banks have catching up to do in terms of user experience. Back says institutions are racing to offer Bitcoin products Adam Back , the only individual personally cited in Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin Whitepaper, said Nakamoto first contacted him in August 2008. He also revealed that Hal Finney tested Bitcoin early, where he wrote some explanations and even speculated that BTC could reach a $100-$200 trillion market cap, hinting at $10M per coin. According to him, the ambitious vision of BTC prompted deeper interest because earlier systems had failed due to centralization or unverifiable issuance, but Bitcoin’s decentralized model promised a better path. Back noted that institutions are racing to offer Bitcoin products, including BTC offerings, derivatives, structured products, and ETFs. Blockstream’s CEO argued that regulatory risk has been less severe than anticipated, with Trump’s administration improving Bitcoin’s institutional adoption environment. He also believes that governments like the U.S. are considering Bitcoin for strategic reserves, which has made it easier for institutions to adopt digital assets. “If Bitcoin reaches its full potential, it will be used by everybody, including what some of the early adopters would consider, you know, the establishment that they were hoping to have self-sovereignty to protect themselves from.” -Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream. Adam Back believes Bitcoin will inevitably be financialized. He argued that companies like Strategy multiply their Bitcoin exposure through enterprise value, which he said is sustainable while BTC adoption grows. Back also noted that companies like Strategy could support BTC’s upward price momentum because they acquire Bitcoin directly and offer indirect exposure through instruments such as convertible bonds. Back also highlighted the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin, including investments by sovereign wealth funds. He cited Abu Dhabi’s $408.5 million stake in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF. Adam Back sees Bitcoin hitting $500K to $1M in the current market cycle Adam Back says \""$100,000 is way too cheap\"" and that Bitcoin gets between \""$500,000 and $1 Million during this cycle.\"" 🚀 pic.twitter.com/hcq9HeooCk — Bold Bitcoin (@BoldBitcoin) May 14, 2025 Adam Back expressed his surprise at BTC’s current price level, which is hovering around $108,600 at the time of publication, given the surge in institutional interest and major developments in the crypto industry. He believes that the digital currency could surge to between $500,000 and $1 million per coin during the current market cycle. Despite being slightly below its all-time high of nearly $112,000, the crypto mogul argued the price does not yet reflect the full scope of bullish momentum building behind the asset. He noted that the four-year cycle in the asset’s price action tends to stretch over time, and we’re still early in the current one. Adam Back argued that key catalysts include the U.S. approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have already drawn in more than $44 billion in net inflows. According to him, ETFs offered by financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity have opened the door to a new wave of investors, particularly those previously hesitant to hold virtual currencies directly. Blockstream’s CEO mentioned that much of the investor capital tends to arrive after prices begin to rise. He also argued that the market could get a new all-time high much quicker, emphasizing that momentum and retail psychology often fuel further gains. Michael Saylor, founder of Strategy, noted that BTC’s recent price stagnation below the $150K mark can be attributed to short-term holders exiting the market. He explained on May 9 that a market rotation is underway, with non-long-term holders cashing out and a new wave of committed investors entering. Saylor acknowledged that a lot of Bitcoin remained in the hands of governments, lawyers, and bankruptcy trustees. He believes those parties don’t have a 10-year mindset and are seizing the rally as an opportunity to liquidate. The crypto mogul also revealed that Bitcoin is now finding its way into the hands of institutions and investors with a longer time horizon, particularly through spot BTC ETFs and corporate treasury strategies.

2025-05-28T12:30:32.000Z,"Trump Media Makes Waves With Major $2.5 Billion Bitcoin Purchase","President Donald Trump’s social media company , Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), has announced plans to invest in the market’s leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) on Tuesday. According to a report by Politico, the company, which oversees the Truth Social platform, has secured commitments from approximately 50 large investors to raise $2.5 billion through a combination of stock and debt. Trump Media Expands Into Bitcoin Devin Nunes, CEO of TMTG and a former Republican representative, remarked , “We view Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets.” Nunes further described this Bitcoin investment as a pivotal step in defending the company against financial institutions that may impose discriminatory practices on Americans and US businesses. Nunes also highlighted that the acquisition would enhance synergies related to subscription payments, a proposed utility token , and other financial transactions across Truth Social and the company’s streaming platform, Truth+. The company anticipates that the fundraising efforts will conclude by Thursday. Beyond this, the move signals a growing interest in cryptocurrency from Trump and his family’s business ventures, which have seen setbacks in recent years. Shares Of TMTG Drop Despite Initial Surge The Trump family has previously supported various crypto initiatives, including World Liberty Financial (WLFI), while Eric Trump co-founded American Bitcoin, which recently announced plans to go public. Just days before his inauguration back in January, President Donald Trump launched his own cryptocurrency , TRUMP, which rose from below $10 to beyond $70 in just 24 hours on the heels of major excitement surrounding this launch. However, this foray into the crypto space has raised ethical and conflict-of-interest concerns within Washington. As reported by Bitcoinist last week, the President hosted a gala dinner at his Virginia golf club for top holders of his memecoin, which prompted protests outside the venue. For TMTG, the decision to invest in BTC represents a new direction for the company, which has primarily relied on advertising revenue from Truth Social. In December, Trump transferred his stake in the company to a trust managed by his son, Donald Trump Jr., who is also a board member. Following the announcement of the new Bitcoin treasury, shares of TMTG, trading under the ticker “DJT,” initially surged in early trading but later fell by more than 5%. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has managed to regain the $110,000 after a slight pullback below the $109,000 mark to open the week. Still, the market’s leading cryptocurrency holds gains of over 16% on the monthly time frame and 56% year-to-date (YTD).

2025-05-28T12:27:06.000Z,"GameStop Buys $512M in Bitcoin, Joins Crypto Elite","The post GameStop Buys $512M in Bitcoin, Joins Crypto Elite appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News GameStop has officially entered the Bitcoin game with a splash, acquiring 4,710 BTC in its first-ever crypto purchase. The announcement, made via the company’s official X account on May 28, positions the gaming retailer as one of the more prominent public holders of Bitcoin, joining the ranks of MicroStrategy and Tesla. With Bitcoin trading around $108,800 at the time, GameStop’s holdings are valued at roughly $512 million. However, the company didn’t reveal the exact purchase price in its SEC filing. GameStop has purchased 4,710 Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/gGdr0BRrAv — GameStop (@gamestop) May 28, 2025 Backed by $1.5B in Convertible Notes GameStop was able to buy Bitcoin because, back in April, it raised $1.5 billion by selling a special kind of IOU to investors. These IOUs don’t pay any interest and are due to be paid back in 2030. Investors were so interested that GameStop even raised an extra $200 million. The company clearly said in official filings that this money would be used to buy Bitcoin. This big crypto move shows that GameStop is trying to branch out from its struggling video game business. The company had already tried its hand at NFTs and launched its crypto wallet before. While the news boosted positive vibes around Bitcoin and slightly pushed its price up, no one knows yet if GameStop plans to keep buying more BTC or if this was just a one-time splash to try something new with its cash. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Analysis: May Rally and Lark Davis’s Take on Market Top Signals , Crypto Community Reacts GameStop’s entry into crypto has been welcomed by many in the digital asset space, with some seeing it as a bullish signal for broader corporate adoption. Crypto user Tommy T calls GameStop’s 4,710 BTC buy more than just a purchase; it’s a power move. Once mocked as “dumb money,” retail investors are now outsmarting hedge funds. He says the game is changing, and retail isn’t just playing, it’s rewriting the rules. Still, skeptics remain cautious, waiting to see how the company integrates Bitcoin into its future roadmap amid ongoing retail challenges. CEO in Legal Scoop? Additionally, GameStop’s CEO, Ryan Cohen, is currently facing a lawsuit over $47.2 million he earned from trading Bed Bath & Beyond shares just before the company went bankrupt. The case claims that Cohen and his firm, RC Ventures, may have made “short-swing” trades, which could force them to return those profits. Either way, GameStop’s $512M Bitcoin buy cements its commitment to digital innovation and could be a peak moment in its ongoing reinvention. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-28T12:26:05.000Z,"SharpLink’s Ethereum Treasury Move Triggers 400% Stock Surge","When SharpLink Gaming Ltd. announced that it was taking its corporate treasury to Ethereum, few would have thought the market reaction. Within hours, the company's shares increased by 400%, catapulting the sports betting tech firm to crypto stardom. But behind the headline flash is a story of strategic innovation, industry alignment, and a bold bet on the digital asset future. A New Type of Corporate Treasury SharpLink's move is more than a news headline maker — it's a return to fundamentals in the manner in which companies treat their balance sheets. CEO Rob Phythian stated in a statement, ”We believe Ethereum's ecosystem offers both the liquidity and programmability to support our long-term vision.” The company has begun to transition much of its cash reserves into Ethereum (ETH), joining the ranks of the first publicly traded companies to formally adopt an ETH-denominated policy of the treasury. This is not just about having a risky asset. SharpLink board minutes reveal a plan to leverage Ethereum's DeFi protocols to earn yields, hedge, and even use for working payments. The company considers ETH not only a store of value but also an operational working capital asset—much like the way MicroStrategy famously leveraged Bitcoin to turbocharge its own treasury. Consensys Joins the Board: Strategic Alignment The intrigue was compounded when blockchain giant Consensys, the company behind MetaMask and a force behind the development of Ethereum, joined SharpLink's board. Consensys possesses deep technical acumen and a close relationship with the underlying breakthroughs of Ethereum. ”This partnership is not simply about investment,” said a representative for Consensys. ”It's about injecting Ethereum-native thinking into the DNA of an innovation-focused company.” Insiders forecast Consensys will help guide SharpLink along on-chain treasury management, smart contract integrations, and even tokenization strategies in the future. The move is part of an emerging trend: crypto veterans are calling for influence in traditional industries as Ethereum's institutional appeal grows. Following MicroStrategy — But with Ether SharpLink's playbook tracks MicroStrategy's legendary Bitcoin pivot, except for one twist. While MicroStrategy's Michael Saylor took on the role of Bitcoin evangelist, SharpLink is betting on Ethereum's more utility and network effects. Company Treasury Asset Strategy Highlights Stock Reaction MicroStrategy Bitcoin (BTC) Buy-and-hold, leverage, advocacy +1,000%+ SharpLink Ethereum (ETH) DeFi integration, board expansion +400% The difference? Ethereum programmability allows SharpLink to do more than just hold. The company can stake ETH, earn yield, and potentially use smart contracts for payroll, vendor payments, and more. This kind of flexibility can set the new standard for how tech companies manage digital assets. On-Chain Treasury Moves and Tax Implications Blockchain sleuths have already pinpointed SharpLink's treasury wallet accumulating ETH, with inflows via large exchanges and DeFi protocols. SharpLink is experimenting with staking and liquidity pools, which can boost returns but exposes the company to smart contract risk, say analysts. Tax professionals are watching closely. Unlike Bitcoin, which is more likely to be considered a non-yielding asset, ETH staking rewards might be considered income, triggering different tax obligations. ”SharpLink will need to meticulously track its on-chain activity,” says crypto tax attorney Lisa Tran. ”The IRS is watching very closely what kind of reporting businesses are doing on staking and DeFi yields.” Altseason Signal? Ether's Price Target and Forecast SharpLink's flagship ETH treasury move has fueled speculation of a wider ”altseason”—a period during which alternative coins outperform Bitcoin. Some experts interpret this as evidence that Ethereum is growing as an organizational reserve asset, especially with ETH 2.0 upgrades and institutional adoption gaining momentum. While it's too early to call a new trend, Ether bulls are eyeing price levels above $10,000 on the strength of expanding demand from corporations and decentralized applications. ”SharpLink's move is potentially the trigger that can initiate another wave of corporate ETH adoption,” says market analyst Rahul Patel. ”If others were to follow, we might witness a sea change in treasury management practices.”.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9342/sharp-link-s-ethereum-treasury-move-triggers-400-stock-surge,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Ethereum",cryptocompare
2025-05-28T12:23:52.000Z,"Bitcoin Pepe Is Flying—$11.8m Raised and Only 3 Days Left","The post Bitcoin Pepe Is Flying—$11.8m Raised and Only 3 Days Left appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News What if the next 100x doesn’t launch on Solana or Ethereum, but on Bitcoin? With $11.8m raised and no competitors, Bitcoin Pepe is accelerating toward a Tier-1 exchange debut on May 31 that could reshape how Bitcoin works for retail. BPEP is the first meme ICO that’s setting up Bitcoin’s next growth phase, one that isn’t just institutional but grassroots, creator-driven, and performance-ready. With just 3 days to go, the window is closing on what might be the first truly viral Layer 2 ecosystem on BTC. With new partnerships being announced every day and energy accelerating toward launch, make sure to check the official Bitcoin Pepe for the latest updates. Bitcoin’s missing piece: Bitcoin Pepe’s layer 2 fixes what BTC left behind Bitcoin Pepe is developing PEP-20, a new token standard that makes it possible to issue, trade, and interact with meme assets natively on Bitcoin. Ethereum has ERC-20, but Bitcoin never had a native way to scale tokens—until now. The potential ripple effect is huge. Low-cost meme creation invites the same kind of explosion we saw on Solana: an open field of creators, culture, and rapid liquidity formation. It’s about unlocking new utility on top of it, at a moment when Bitcoin’s price makes traditional entry increasingly out of reach for most. This is the first meme ICO on Bitcoin, and it’s not just symbolic. It’s about building an open architecture where memes and microassets can finally live on the world’s oldest chain. BTC maximalists stay for the trust, degens stay for the gains, and creators stay for the tools. BPEP price outlook: Why Bitcoin Pepe could outpace the market Bitcoin Pepe is building on one of crypto’s strongest narratives: retail investors want high-upside exposure on the most trusted chain. With Bitcoin’s price breaking above $110K and institutions buying in, BPEP offers a low-barrier, high-energy entry point that BTC itself simply doesn’t. Interest in Bitcoin Pepe is intensifying as it prepares for its May 31 listing. Major partnerships, high-level exchange rumors, and a perfect macro setup are all feeding into what could be the biggest meme-layer launch on any chain this year. Top-tier platforms such as OKX and Bybit are reportedly preparing to list BPEP, paving the way for significant volume. Meanwhile, the team is expanding fast, aligning with Web3 gaming ( Crypto Hunters and GETE Network ), DeFi ( Plena Finance and Catamoto ), fair launch platforms ( Super Meme ), and content-first networks ( BETV ). These are to anchor BPEP in real utility and culture, two ingredients needed to scale. The momentum is also social. Influencers on X and YouTube have already picked up the scent. And if Bitcoin continues climbing toward a new ATH—as macro signals increasingly suggest—then tokens tied to its upside, like BPEP, could surge. The big question is whether this becomes the Solana moment for Bitcoin, a layer with real throughput, meme velocity, and network reach. When Solana’s token economy exploded, its value increased by 1000 times because it facilitated large-scale activity. Bitcoin Pepe is doing exactly that, but on the most credible chain in the world. Solana on Bitcoin launches in less than 3 days Bitcoin is winning over institutions, but retail is priced out and is hunting for the next breakout opportunity. At $110K, BTC won’t deliver 100x. But with over $11.8m raised and a current price of only $0.0377, Bitcoin Pepe might. It’s a layer 2 engineered to activate retail, creators, and builders on Bitcoin itself —something BTC has never offered. While institutions are accumulating Bitcoin for the long term, Bitcoin Pepe is paving the way for those who missed the initial surge but are determined not to miss this one. Long story short, Bitcoin Pepe is how retail comes back in.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/bitcoin-pepe-is-flying-11-2m-raised-and-only-5-days-left/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|SOL|TRADING|ZRX","Sponsored",cryptocompare
2025-05-28T12:22:56.000Z,"While Bitcoin Dominates Capital, Lightchain AI Dominates Curiosity in the Presale Crowd","Bitcoin continues to command the lion’s share of capital across the crypto market, but when it comes to investor curiosity—especially among presale participants —Lightchain AI is stealing the spotlight. With all 15 presale stages completed and the Bonus Round now active, Lightchain AI has already raised $20.8 million while maintaining its accessible entry price of $0.007. This surge of attention isn’t just speculative—it’s driven by the project’s real-world focus on decentralized AI execution and intelligent computation. As investors grow more selective, Lightchain AI’s blend of practical utility, scalable infrastructure, and governance-driven architecture is becoming a key talking point across communities and forums. While Bitcoin holds its dominance through market maturity, Lightchain AI is dominating conversation through innovation—positioning itself as one of the most watched early-stage projects heading into 2025. Why Investor Attention Is Splitting Between Store of Value and Emerging Innovation Bitcoin remains the market’s dominant store of value, drawing in institutional capital and long-term holders who prioritize security and macro-level positioning. But a different kind of interest is forming around innovation-focused projects like Lightchain AI , particularly within the presale ecosystem. Now in its Bonus Round with over $20.8 million raised at a fixed $0.007 price, Lightchain AI is gaining attention for reasons Bitcoin can’t offer—new architecture, untapped potential, and early-stage exposure. As crypto matures, investors are increasingly splitting their strategies: allocating some to stable anchors like BTC, while also exploring utility-focused infrastructure like Lightchain AI that could define the next phase of decentralized growth. This diversification isn’t about abandoning Bitcoin—it’s about recognizing that real innovation now lives in places BTC’s limited scope can’t quite reach. Could Lightchain AI’s Early Buzz Outpace Bitcoin’s Quiet Accumulation Phase As Bitcoin stealthily accumulates, Lightchain AI is shaping up to look a lot more dynamic. Its presale Bonus Round already has seen more than $20.8 million in commitments, proof that speculative curiosity is alive and well among those willing to look beyond established giants. Unlike Bitcoin which serves as a macro-economic hedge, Lightchain AI provides a general purpose platform designed for decentralized AI execution. Its features include scalable sharding and on-chain governance, as well as intelligent task support—all of which are for utility, not just asset storage. That juxtaposition is generating the kind of buzz for Lightchain AI that Bitcoin at best only enjoyed as it was approaching this phase of its own maturity cycle. BTC is still the bedrock of the market, but Lightchain AI’s ascending attention curve indicates that investor energy is moving towards what’s next. What Drives Curiosity Toward Presale Projects When Giants Like BTC Lead Capital Flow Even as Bitcoin continues to dominate in capital allocation, curiosity among retail and mid-tier investors is frequently directed at presale-stage tokens. The reason is simple: upside potential. Lightchain AI, still in its Bonus Round at $0.007, offers a rare mix of accessibility and infrastructure depth that BTC no longer can. While Bitcoin’s function is largely passive—anchored in holding value— Lightchain AI invites participation in an evolving ecosystem. It enables decentralized AI workloads, supports cryptographic data privacy, and engages its community through governance voting. These features create multiple layers of involvement and future utility, turning passive interest into active speculation. When giants like BTC hold the capital, presales like Lightchain AI hold the imagination. And in a market driven by both, it’s often curiosity—not just liquidity—that sparks the next breakout.

2025-05-28T12:19:17.000Z,"Altcoin Season ‘Hasn’t Even Started Yet,’ Says Crypto Trader Michaël van de Poppe","Despite recent doubts surrounding the future of altcoins, prominent crypto trader and MN Trading Capital founder Michaël van de Poppe believes the altcoin season is not over—it hasn’t even begun. In a post on X dated May 28, van de Poppe dismissed bearish sentiment in the market, arguing that many altcoins are still trading near their local bottoms. “I don’t understand why people start claiming that a bear market is around the corner,” he said. “They are literally on the bottom.” He added that the crypto market is heading into the “final easy 12–24 months,” suggesting that a prolonged bullish phase could be on the horizon for altcoins. Van de Poppe’s optimism follows a mixed 30-day performance across altcoins. Solana has gained 17.84% over the past month, now trading at $175.17, but is still down over 32% since mid-January. XRP has posted a modest 1.98% increase and is trading at $2.31, yet remains 29.35% lower than its January highs. Traders Signal Incoming Altcoin Season Other traders have echoed van de Poppe’s view, suggesting that altcoins are preparing for a major rally. Crypto trader Davinci Jeremie confidently declared that “soon, altcoins will turn into a wildfire,” while another well-followed trader known as Moustache said, “altcoin season isn’t just a meme. It’s coming.” A common belief among analysts is that a true altcoin season often begins after a period of Ether outperforming Bitcoin. The ETH/BTC ratio currently stands at 0.02430, having climbed 26.74% in the past 30 days. This ratio is considered a key indicator for predicting altcoin momentum , as rising Ether strength often signals increased investor appetite for riskier assets. Still, caution persists. CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index , which measures how the top 100 altcoins have performed against Bitcoin over the last 90 days, currently sits at just 24 out of 100—a score that suggests Bitcoin remains the dominant force in the market . Smaller Tokens See Notable Gains While most major altcoins have underperformed compared to Bitcoin, some lesser-known tokens have surged. Fartcoin leads the way with a staggering 316.72% gain over the past 90 days. It is followed by Four (FORM) with a 148.15% increase and Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL), up 107.47%. Despite the skepticism, the recent uptick in altcoin activity may be a sign that the long-awaited altseason is just around the corner.

With this acquisition, GameStop joins the ranks of industry leaders like Strategy, Tesla, and Block, marking a significant shift in its corporate strategy. The announcement comes at a time when Bitcoin continues to assert itself as digital gold, drawing increasing interest from institutions, corporations, and investors alike. For GameStop — once the iconic face of the 2021 “meme stock” frenzy — this leap into Bitcoin marks not just a financial investment but a clear statement about its ambitions for the future. GameStop has purchased 4,710 Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/gGdr0BRrAv — GameStop (@gamestop) May 28, 2025 From Meme Stock Legend to Bitcoin Holder GameStop’s adoption of Bitcoin marks a significant shift in its corporate trajectory. Once seen as a struggling brick-and-mortar retailer, GameStop shot to international fame in early 2021 when retail traders on Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum engineered a historic short squeeze, propelling the company’s stock price and turning it into a symbol of grassroots financial rebellion. Since that time, GameStop has worked to reinvent itself, exploring digital initiatives such as NFTs, blockchain gaming, and online commerce. The addition of 4,710 BTC to its balance sheet signals that the company is now betting on Bitcoin’s long-term value and global relevance. For GameStop, this isn’t merely a speculative move — it’s a calculated effort to align with the forces reshaping the future of finance and technology. Joining a Growing Corporate Trend With this purchase, GameStop joins a growing list of prominent companies integrating Bitcoin into their corporate treasuries. Strategy , under the leadership of Bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor, has famously acquired over 200,000 BTC, establishing itself as the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency. Tesla made headlines in 2021 with its own high-profile Bitcoin acquisition, while fintech giant Block (formerly Square) has consistently positioned Bitcoin at the center of its long-term vision. By stepping into this elite circle, GameStop signals confidence in Bitcoin’s role as more than just a volatile asset — it sees Bitcoin as a strategic reserve and a hedge against inflation and currency risk. As macroeconomic uncertainty continues to swirl globally, Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature make it increasingly appealing for companies seeking to diversify their balance sheets and future-proof their financial strategies. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Investor and Market Impact For investors, GameStop’s announcement introduces a compelling new narrative around the company’s trajectory. While GameStop has faced challenges maintaining profitability in a rapidly shifting retail environment, its bold entrance into the world of digital assets suggests a willingness to explore unconventional growth strategies. This move could reinvigorate investor interest, particularly among those eager to see GameStop push beyond its past as a brick-and-mortar retailer. GameStop’s move simultaneously boosts Bitcoin’s credibility as a viable asset for corporate treasuries. Each new public company that adopts Bitcoin adds momentum to its growing mainstream acceptance. GameStop’s decision could encourage other mid-cap and emerging companies to explore Bitcoin as a financial option, especially those looking to connect with younger, tech-savvy audiences. A Bold Bet on the Digital Future At its heart, GameStop’s purchase of 4,710 Bitcoin is more than just a financial transaction — it’s a statement about where the company believes the future is headed. As Bitcoin continues to attract institutional investment and command global attention, GameStop’s bold step positions it at the crossroads of gaming, finance, and technology. Whether this move ultimately proves to be a masterstroke or a risky gamble remains to be seen. But one thing is certain: GameStop is no longer just the poster child of the meme stock era — it is now an active participant in the sweeping transformation of global finance. By joining the Bitcoin bandwagon, GameStop has once again captured the world’s attention, this time with a move that could redefine its place in the digital age.

These include AnchorZero, a platform helping crypto founders use Roth IRAs for tax advantages, and Spark Capital, a new venture focused on stablecoin infrastructure.Other portfolio companies include Ethena, ClearToken, Crossover Markets, Station70 and Theo — an onchain trading infrastructure project that recently raised $20 million from 17 different VC firms.The company plans to eventually back up to 30 companies with early-stage rounds ranging from $500,000 to $1 million.Metalayer was co-founded by Chainlink Labs’ former head of growth, Mickey Graham, and former Two Sigma executives Andy Kangpan and David Winton.Winton developed a proprietary data platform called Moirai to help Metalayer analyze developer activity, protocol engagement and blockchain transaction patterns to uncover promising projects. “Moirai is our internal sourcing engine for identifying early-stage crypto startups,” Graham told Cointelegraph in a written statement. “The platform is designed to help us systematically surface high-quality startups, and it evaluates opportunities across several key dimensions,” he said.Related: VC Roundup: 8-figure funding deals suggest crypto bull market far from overCrypto VC deals on the rise, but there’s a catchCrypto venture capital activity saw a notable uptick in the first quarter, with increases in both total funding and deal volume, according to data from Galaxy Digital. VC funding reached $4.9 billion during the quarter, though nearly half came from a single deal — Binance, which raised $2 billion from MGX, an investment firm backed by a United Arab Emirates sovereign wealth fund.Despite the outsized impact of the Binance deal, overall market activity showed signs of improving. A total of 446 crypto funding deals were recorded in Q1, marking a 7% increase from the previous quarter.Crypto VC deals remain considerably lower than the peak of the previous bull market. Source: GalaxyNevertheless, venture capital investors remain cautious about making fresh commitments to the sector, according to Robert Lee, a senior analyst at PitchBook. The first quarter was a challenging market environment as a sharp correction in crypto prices compounded investor reluctance.In an interview with Bloomberg last month, Lee noted that many venture capital firms are still on the sidelines. “[M]any of the funds from the last cycle have yet to deliver meaningful DPI,” he said, referring to the private equity metric Distributed to Paid-In Capital, which measures how much capital has been returned to investors relative to what they invested.Metalayer’s Mickey Graham believes that at least some of this drop-off is due to a much-needed transition happening beneath the surface:“We believe the crypto industry has crossed the chasm from an early market defined by infrastructure-building to a mainstream technology sector characterized by the deployment of blockchain technology throughout the global economy.”Although VC activity remains subdued compared to past bull cycles, Kadan Stadelmann, the chief technology officer of the Komodo Platform, told Cointelegraph that the industry has seen an “uptick in mergers and acquisitions, suggesting market maturation.”Stadelmann indicated that pro-crypto regulations in the United States and European Union, “have given large institutions confidence to continue making investments into crypto firms.”At a geographic level, the US accounted for more than a third of total crypto VC deals in 2024 — a trend expected to continue this year.

Could this technical setup, coupled with the SEC’s review of a spot XRP ETF application by WisdomTree, signal the start of a rally to $3.40 and higher?XRP falling wedge pattern targets $3.40From a technical perspective, XRP (XRP) price could gain significant momentum if it breaks out of this falling wedge pattern.In technical analysis, a falling wedge is a bullish reversal chart pattern that comprises two converging trend lines that connect lower highs and lower lows. This convergence indicates a weakening downward momentum. XRP price is currently retesting the resistance provided by the upper trendline of the wedge at $2.42. A break above this level will likely trigger a quick rise in price, with the bulls targeting the technical target of the wedge at $3.40, a 48% increase from current prices.XRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe relative strength index (RSI) has climbed to 47 from 31 on April 8, indicating that bullish momentum is building up.However, to sustain the ongoing recovery, XRP’s price has to first hold the support at $2.20 and then overcome the resistance between $2.60 and $2.80.Several analysts are optimistic about a rebound higher, with pseudonymous trader Cryptowzrd saying that a validation of a falling wedge could see XRP break out toward $2.90.“$XRP closed indecisively and is still maintaining a falling wedge formation,” the trader wrote in a May 28 post on X, adding: “A breakout of this wedge will push markets toward the $2.80 resistance.

In his widely cited 2022 paper, “The Ineluctable Modality of Securities Law: Why Fungible Crypto Assets Are Not Securities,” he wrote:“[T]here is no current basis in the law relating to ‘investment contracts’ to classify most fungible crypto assets as ‘securities’ when transferred in secondary transactions.”In his paper, Cohen explained that in secondary transactions, an investment contract transaction is generally not present. He further claimed that fungible cryptocurrencies “neither create nor represent the necessary cognizable legal relationship between” a legal entity and the holder that is the “hallmark of a security.”Related: Banking groups ask SEC to drop cybersecurity incident disclosure ruleSEC’s “new paradigm”Ripple also referenced SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce's May 19 “new paradigm” speech.

My supplemental answer is that economic realities matter and non-security crypto assets may be distributed as part of an investment contract, which is a type of security.”Ripple’s long fight with the SECThe SEC had viewed a large portion of digital assets as securities, with the regulator’s former chair, Gary Gensler, stating in 2023 that most of the crypto market falls under the securities bracket. This stance led to a protracted legal battle between the SEC and Ripple.The lawsuit first began at the end of 2020, when the SEC took action against Ripple and its executives, claiming that XRP sales constituted unregistered security offerings. Still, after the government’s stance on crypto changed with the election of current US President Donald Trump, Ripple has mostly won the battle, with the SEC recently dropping its appeal against a ruling favorable to the company.In its recent letter to the SEC, Ripple also cited a ruling in the case noting that “the court held that certain of Ripple’s historical institutional sales of XRP were investment contracts,” while the secondary sales were not.

Five commissioners are supposed to make up the CFTC, and no more than three can be from the same political party.Goldsmith Romero said that during her tenure, all the commissioners had different perspectives and experiences that, when brought together, were “really helpful.”“So what happens if the CFTC gets down to one and gets new authority for crypto? It’s going to be really, really hard; you’re not going to have the same push and pull,” she said.The Trump administration has floated the idea of handing the reins of crypto regulation to the CFTC in the past. Congressional Republicans have also been drafting bills to give the CFTC greater oversight over the industry, Retail customer Definition should be CFTC priority In the future, Goldsmith Romero thinks the CFTC should work on defining a retail customer to ensure the influx of fresh investments in “crypto and some other products” has a similar retail customer protection regime to the Securities and Exchange Commission.Related: Crypto perp futures coming ‘very soon,’ says CFTC’s Mersinger“I came from the SEC with an investor protection regime, you want people to know their rights and risk if they take a risk and they lose that’s on them,” she said.“But you want to have some basic things like exchanges that are registered that have some basic requirements and have to follow the law and this is, I think, the main thing that needs to happen.”Goldsmith Romero said other “extremely basic” rules could include a ban against co-mingling a company’s assets with customer funds, and brokers, exchanges and clearing houses being required to register with the SEC, the CFTC or in some cases, both.Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/goldsmith-romero-cf-exodus-not-a-great-situation?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-28T02:11:48.000Z,"Real-world assets could revitalize dying NFT lending market: DappRadar","Real-world assets linking up with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is one of a few key catalysts that could reignite the waning NFT lending sector, which is suffering from a collapse in volumes and user activity, says blockchain analytics platform DappRadar.Volumes in the NFT lending market, which allows NFT holders to take out a loan against their token, have dropped 97% from a peak of around $1 billion in January 2024 to $50 million in May, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a May 27 report.Gherghelas said for NFT lending to “move beyond survival mode,” it needs “new catalysts” to reignite the sector, such as real-world asset NFTs, like tokenized real estate or yield-bearing assets that could unlock more stable, trusted collateral sources.“So far, 2025 has not delivered a compelling reason for NFT lending to bounce back,” she said. “While the infrastructure is still here and the platforms remain active, activity has slowed across the board.” Borrower and leading activity have taken a big hit in the NFT lending sector. Source: DappRadar“For now, the sector seems to be in a holding pattern, waiting either for market recovery or a new use case to reignite interest.”Gherghelas added that other catalysts that could rekindle NFT lending were tools that make it easier for NFT holders to borrow against their tokens, and that protocols should create “smart infrastructure” such as undercollateralized loans, credit scores and artificial intelligence risk matching.The report adds that since January last year, borrower activity has declined by 90% and those willing to lend have shrunk by 78%.The average NFT loan size has also taken a hit from a peak of $22,000 in 2022 to $4,000 in May, a 71% year-over-year drop.Gherghelas said this shift “shows that either users are borrowing against lower-value assets or simply becoming more conservative with leverage.”NFT lending overall trading volume and market activity have dropped off from the all-time highs of past years. Source: DappRadarThe average loan duration is also lower; after hitting an average of roughly 40 days in 2023, it’s been down to 31 days and has held steady throughout 2024 and into 2025.Gherghelas said this could indicate that “loans are being taken more frequently but for shorter periods, perhaps a sign of more tactical liquidity plays.”NFT ﻿market downturn also hurts lendingPart of the slowdown in NFT lending is connected to the overall NFT market decline, which has seen volumes drop 61% in the first quarter to $1.5 billion compared to $4.1 billion a year ago.“With collateral value collapsing, the lending activity naturally followed,” Gherghelas said. “There are a few exceptions that managed to hold or regain traction, but they’ve been outliers, not enough to lift the sector.”Related: AI decentralized apps are coming for the Web3 throne: DappRadarThe protocol landscape has also narrowed, and the number of active NFT lending apps is limited, with only eight protocols holding any meaningful share.“The flip-for-liquidity model that worked during bull markets isn’t built for a quieter, more risk-averse environment. But that doesn’t mean NFT lending is finished; it’s simply shifting focus,” Gherghelas said.“Platforms are diversifying, use cases are shifting, and collateral preferences are changing. If the next wave builds on utility, culture, and better design, NFT lending might just find its second wind — one built to last.”Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-world-assets-revitalize-dying-nft-lending-dappradar?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

SharpLink will invest $425 million to acquire 120,000 ETH. Ethereum futures open interest hits an all-time high of $36.1 billion, with ETH price climbing 4.5% on the daily chart. Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming (SBET) announced a $425 million private investment in public equity (PIPE), acquiring approximately 69.1 million shares at $6.15 each to establish the first Nasdaq-listed Ethereum (ETH) treasury company.Spearheaded by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, this move mirrors Strategy’s (MSTR) successful Bitcoin treasury strategy, which has yielded over $8.2 billion in gains in 2025, by leveraging stock and bond sales to acquire BTC.Former Ethereum core developer and contributor Eric Conner highlighted the bullish implications of SharpLink’s move, noting its potential to create a “public ETH proxy for funds that can’t hold tokens directly.” Conner emphasized that the acquisition of 120,000 ETH—likely to be staked—could lead to “supply compression” by removing tokens from circulation. The Ether proponent also pointed to the “new narrative fuel” this provides, positioning ETH as a “digital reserve collateral” and potentially driving its adoption on mainstream balance sheets through an equity wrapper like $SBET.However, crypto analyst VICTOR cautioned against over-enthusiasm, outlining the risk of leveraging gains from an altcoin still down 19% in 2025. In Q1 2025, Cointelegraph reported a sharp decline in Ethereum network fees, dropping to $605,000 from $2.5 million in just two weeks in March, alongside a noticeable decrease in decentralized app (DApp) activity.

The majority of these rallies—eight out of ten—resulted in negative returns, while one rally triggered a short squeeze, driving prices higher, and another displayed neutral price action.From a technical perspective, Ether’s price action on the daily chart posted a descending triangle, a bullish breakout pattern, which creates equal highs and higher lows, converging toward an imminent rally. The pattern is bordered by two trendlines, the upper resistance, currently around $2,700 and the ascending support line. A bullish breakout above $2,677 targets the pattern’s measured move, calculated by adding the triangle’s height to the breakout point.

Speaking at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, Sigel said the most viable path forward may involve inserting Bitcoin mining incentives into the congressional budget reconciliation process.According to Sigel, the most effective path to growing a US strategic Bitcoin reserve would be through targeted amendments to congressional budget legislation. These could include tax credits for mining companies that use methane gas and other incentives aimed at encouraging miners to share a portion of their mined BTC with the federal government. He argued that such an approach would allow the reserve to grow organically over time. Sigel also highlighted the limitations of executive actions in achieving this goal:\""The problem with executive action is that it's going to prompt lawsuits. And anything over $100 million is going to get sued by the Elizabeth Warrens of the world. So, I would say start with something maybe in the Exchange Stabilization Fund for $100 million.\""US President Donald Trump established the US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve through a March 7 executive order.

FalconX, a digital asset broker, said it secured a facility worth over $100 million as part of a “broader credit framework,” while Maple Finance reportedly closed the first tranche of an agreement with Cantor.The service allows companies holding Bitcoin to borrow funds and use the cryptocurrency as collateral, providing a way to unlock liquidity without selling their BTC holdings.

At the time, the company said Anchorage Digital and Copper would serve as custodians and collateral managers in the venture.Credit markets are a fundamental part of the financial system, allowing capital to flow between borrowers and lenders and supporting economic activity across sectors.

Bitcoin’s bullish momentum aligns with the favorable US financial conditions, as noted by Ecoinometrics. The macroeconomic-focused Bitcoin newsletter highlighted that the National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) shows a rapid shift to ultra-loose territory after a tightening phase in February 2025. The NFCI, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, tracks stress in the financial system by aggregating measures like credit spreads, leverage, and funding conditions. When the index moves into looser territory, it reflects easier access to capital and reduced market stress—conditions that typically encourage risk-taking behavior among investors. For high-beta assets like Bitcoin, such periods often coincide with price rallies as capital flows into speculative markets.US National Financial Conditions Index.

It’s tracking the same pattern we saw since 2023: easing conditions → capital rotation → risk-on.”With Bitcoin just 2% away from its all-time high price, data from CoinGlass indicates that the probability of a short-squeeze remains high due to significant sell-side liquidity.

2025-05-27T15:40:00.000Z,"93% of all Bitcoin is already mined. Here’s what that means","How much Bitcoin is left to mine?              Bitcoin’s total supply is hardcoded at 21 million BTC, a fixed upper limit that cannot be altered without a consensus-breaking change to the protocol. This finite cap is enforced at the protocol level and is central to Bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset.As of May 2025, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoin (BTC) have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created, and those remaining coins will be mined very slowly.The reason for this uneven distribution is Bitcoin’s exponential issuance schedule, governed by an event called the halving. When Bitcoin launched in 2009, the block reward was 50 BTC. Every 210,000 blocks — or approximately every four years — that reward is cut in half. Because the early rewards were so large, over 87% of the total supply was mined by the end of 2020. Each subsequent halving sharply reduces the rate of new issuance, meaning it will take over a century to mine the remaining 6.7%.According to current estimates, 99% of all Bitcoin will have been mined by 2035, but the final fraction — the last satoshis — won’t be produced until around the year 2140 due to the nature of geometric reward reduction.This engineered scarcity, combined with an immutable supply cap, is what draws comparisons between Bitcoin and physical commodities like gold. But Bitcoin is even more predictable: Gold’s supply grows at around 1.7% annually, whereas Bitcoin’s issuance rate is transparently declining.Did you know? Bitcoin’s supply curve is not terminal in the traditional sense. It follows an asymptotic trajectory — a kind of economic Zeno’s paradox — where rewards diminish indefinitely but never truly reach zero. Mining will continue until around 2140, by which point over 99.999% of the total 21 million BTC will have been issued.                  Beyond the supply cap: How lost coins make Bitcoin scarcer than you think              While over 93% of Bitcoin’s total supply has been mined, that doesn’t mean it’s all available. A significant portion is permanently out of circulation, lost due to forgotten passwords, misplaced wallets, destroyed hard drives or early adopters who never touched their coins again.Estimates from firms like Chainalysis and Glassnode suggest that between 3.0 million and 3.8 million BTC — roughly 14%-18% of the total supply — is likely gone for good. That includes high-profile dormant addresses like the one believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, which alone holds over 1.1 million BTC.This means Bitcoin’s true circulating supply may be closer to 16 million-17 million, not 21 million. And because Bitcoin is non-recoverable by design, any lost coins stay lost — permanently reducing supply over time.Now compare that to gold. Around 85% of the world’s total gold supply has been mined — approximately 216,265 metric tons, according to the World Gold Council — but nearly all of it remains in circulation or held in vaults, jewelry, ETFs and central banks. Gold can be remelted and reused; Bitcoin cannot be resurrected once access is lost.This distinction gives Bitcoin a kind of hardening scarcity, a supply that not only stops growing over time but quietly shrinks.As Bitcoin matures, it’s entering a monetary phase similar to gold: low issuance, high holder concentration and increasing demand-side sensitivity. But Bitcoin takes it further; its supply cap is hard, its loss rate is permanent, and its distribution is publicly auditable.This may lead to several outcomes:Increased price volatility as available supply becomes more limited and sensitive to market demandHigher long-term value concentration in the hands of those who remain active and secure in their key managementA premium on liquidity, where actually spendable BTC trades at a higher effective value than dormant supply.In extreme cases, this could produce a bifurcation between “circulating BTC” and “unreachable BTC,” with the former gaining greater economic significance, particularly in times of constrained exchange liquidity or macroeconomic stress.                  What happens when Bitcoin is fully mined?              There’s a popular assumption that as Bitcoin’s block rewards shrink, the network’s security will eventually suffer. But in practice, the mining economy is far more adaptive — and much more resilient — than that.Bitcoin’s mining incentives are governed by a self-correcting feedback loop: If mining becomes unprofitable, miners drop off the network, which in turn triggers a difficulty adjustment. Every 2,016 blocks (roughly every two weeks), the network recalibrates mining difficulty using a parameter known as nBits. The goal is to keep block times steady at around 10 minutes, regardless of how many miners are competing.So, if Bitcoin’s price drops, or the reward becomes too small relative to operating costs, inefficient miners simply exit. This causes difficulty to fall, lowering the cost for those who remain. The result is a system that continually rebalances itself, aligning network participation with available incentives.This mechanism has already been tested at scale. After China banned mining in mid-2021, Bitcoin’s global hashrate dropped by more than 50% in a matter of weeks. Yet the network continued to function without interruption, and within a few months, the hashrate fully recovered, as miners resumed operations in jurisdictions with lower energy costs and more favorable regulations.Critically, the idea that lower rewards will inherently threaten network security overlooks how mining is tied to profit margins, not nominal BTC amounts. As long as the market price supports the cost of hash power — even at 0.78125 BTC per block (post-2028 halving) or lower — miners will continue to secure the network.In other words, it’s not the absolute reward that matters, but whether mining remains profitable relative to costs. And thanks to Bitcoin’s built-in difficulty adjustment, it usually does.Even a century from now, when the block reward approaches zero, the network will likely still be protected by whatever combination of fees, base incentives and infrastructure efficiency exists at that time. But that’s a distant concern. In the meantime, the current system — hashrate adjusts, difficulty rebalances, miners adapt — remains one of the most robust elements of Bitcoin’s design.Did you know? On April 20, 2024, following the launch of the Runes protocol, Bitcoin miners earned over $80 million in transaction fees within a single day, surpassing the $26 million earned from block rewards. This marked the first time in Bitcoin’s history that transaction fees alone exceeded the block subsidy in daily miner revenue.                  The future of Bitcoin mining: Energy consumption              It’s a common misconception that rising Bitcoin prices will drive endless energy use. In reality, mining is constrained by profitability, not price alone.As block rewards shrink, miners are pushed toward thinner margins, and that means chasing the cheapest, cleanest energy available. Since China’s 2021 mining ban, hashrate has migrated to regions like North America and Northern Europe, where operators tap into surplus hydro, wind and underutilized grid energy.According to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, between 52% and 59% of Bitcoin mining now runs on renewables or low-emission sources. Regulations are reinforcing this trend, with several jurisdictions offering incentives for clean-powered mining or penalizing fossil-fuel operations.Moreover, the idea that higher BTC prices will always mean higher energy use misses how Bitcoin self-regulates: More miners raise difficulty, which compresses margins, capping energy expansion. Renewable-based mining brings its own challenges, but the dystopian future of endlessly expanding fossil-fueled hash power is increasingly unlikely.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/93-of-all-bitcoin-is-already-mined-heres-what-that-means?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T15:00:00.000Z,"ZKPs can prove I&#039;m old enough without telling you my age","Opinion by: Andre Omietanski, General Counsel, and Amal Ibraymi, Legal Counsel at Aztec LabsWhat if you could prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthday, name, or anything else at all? Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) make this hypothetical a reality and solve one of the key challenges online: verifying age without sacrificing privacy. The need for better age verification todayWe're witnessing an uptick in laws being proposed restricting minors' access to social media and the internet, including in Australia, Florida, and China. To protect minors from inappropriate adult content, platform owners and governments often walk a tightrope between inaction and overreach. For example, the state of Louisiana in the US recently enacted a law meant to block minors from viewing porn. Sites required users to upload an ID before viewing content. The Free Speech Coalition challenged the law as unconstitutional, making the case that it infringed on First Amendment rights. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed on procedural grounds. The reaction, however, highlights the dilemma facing policymakers and platforms: how to block minors without violating adults' rights or creating new privacy risks.Traditional age verification failsCurrent age verification tools are either ineffective or invasive. Self-declaration is meaningless, since users can simply lie about their age. ID-based verification is overly invasive. No one should be required to upload their most sensitive documents, putting themselves at risk of data breaches and identity theft. Biometric solutions like fingerprints and face scans are convenient for users but raise important ethical, privacy, and security concerns. Biometric systems are not always accurate and may generate false positives and negatives. The irreversible nature of the data, which can't be changed like a regular password can, is also less than ideal. Other methods, like behavioral tracking and AI-driven verification of browser patterns, are also problematic, using machine learning to analyze user interactions and identify patterns and anomalies, raising concerns of a surveillance culture.ZKPs as the privacy-preserving solutionZero-knowledge proofs present a compelling solution. Like a government ID provider, a trusted entity verifies the user's age and generates a cryptographic proof confirming they are over the required age. Websites only need to check the proof, not the excess personal data, ensuring privacy while keeping minors at the gates. No centralized data storage is required, alleviating the burden on platforms such as Google, Meta, and WhatsApp and eliminating the risk of data breaches. Recent: How zero-knowledge proofs can make AI fairerAdopting and enforcing ZKPs at scaleZKPs aren't a silver bullet. They can be complex to implement. The notion of \""don't trust, verify,\"" proven by indisputable mathematics, may cause some regulatory skepticism. Policymakers may hesitate to trust cryptographic proofs over visible ID verification. There are occasions when companies may need to disclose personal information to authorities, such as during an investigation into financial crimes or government inquiries. This would challenge ZKPs, whose very intention is for platforms not to hold this data in the first place.ZKPs also struggle with scalability and performance, being somewhat computationally intensive and tricky to program. Efficient implementation techniques are being explored, and breakthroughs, such as the Noir programming language, are making ZKPs more accessible to developers, driving the adoption of secure, privacy-first solutions. A safer, smarter future for age verificationGoogle's move to adopt ZKPs for age verification is a promising signal that mainstream platforms are beginning to embrace privacy-preserving technologies. But to fully realize the potential of ZKPs, we need more than isolated solutions locked into proprietary ecosystems. Crypto-native wallets can go further. Open-source and permissionless blockchain-based systems offer interoperability, composability, and programmable identity. With a single proof, users can access a range of services across the open web — no need to start from scratch every time, or trust a single provider (Google) with their credentials.ZKPs flip the script on online identity — proving what matters, without exposing anything else. They protect user privacy, help platforms stay compliant, and block minors from restricted content, all without creating new honeypots of sensitive data.Google's adoption of ZKPs shows mainstream momentum is building. But to truly transform digital identity, we must embrace crypto-native, decentralized systems that give users control over what they share and who they are online.In an era defined by surveillance, ZKPs offer a better path forward — one that's secure, private, and built for the future.Opinion by: Andre Omietanski, General Counsel, and Amal Ibraymi, Legal Counsel at Aztec Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-27T14:30:00.000Z,"What is a cryptocurrency mixer and how does it work?","Cryptocurrency mixers explained              A cryptocurrency mixer is a specialized service designed to increase the privacy and anonymity of blockchain transactions. Unlike traditional financial transactions, which are private by default, most cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) operate on public blockchains. This means every transaction is permanently recorded and accessible to anyone, making it possible for blockchain analysts or malicious actors to trace the flow of funds between wallets.A crypto mixer’s primary function is to break the link between the sender’s wallet and the recipient’s wallet. It does so by pooling together coins from many users and then redistributing them in a way that makes it difficult to track which coins went where. Think of it like a digital version of shuffling cards in a deck. After mixing, your cryptocurrency is returned to you or a recipient’s address, but it’s “cleaned” of any direct transaction history.This privacy-enhancing feature is why some people rely on mixers, especially those seeking to keep their financial activities confidential in an open-ledger world.                  How does a crypto mixer work?              To understand a crypto mixer, it’s useful to compare it to the concept of money laundering in traditional finance, albeit with legal and ethical nuances. The process of “mixing” is essentially designed to obscure the origin and destination of coins.Here’s a typical workflow of how a cryptocurrency mixer operates:Deposit: You send your cryptocurrency to the mixer’s wallet address. Multiple users do the same, creating a large pool of coins.Mixing/shuffling: The mixer’s system pools and shuffles these coins together, breaking any visible connection between deposited and withdrawn funds.Redistribution: After mixing, the service sends back an equivalent amount of coins to your specified address, but these aren’t the same coins you deposited. They come from the pooled coins of all participants.Fees: The mixer usually deducts a small fee, generally ranging from 1% to 3%, to cover operational costs.This process effectively disrupts blockchain analysis, making it extremely difficult for anyone to trace the coins back to their original owners.                  Types of cryptocurrency mixers              Not all mixers are created equal. They can broadly be divided into two categories: centralized and decentralized mixers.Centralized mixersCentralized mixers are the most common and operate similarly to traditional services. You send your coins to a company or entity that controls the mixing process, and then they send back “clean” coins after mixing. These services are relatively easy to use, often providing a simple user interface.However, centralized mixers require you to trust the service operator with your coins, at least temporarily. This introduces risks such as:The mixer could be a scam and disappear with your funds.It could be hacked, exposing users’ data and coins.The operator may keep logs that could compromise your privacy.Decentralized mixersDecentralized mixers use blockchain technology and smart contracts to automate the mixing process without a trusted third party. They rely on cryptographic methods such as zero-knowledge proofs to mix coins in a trustless environment. Users pool their coins into a smart contract, which then redistributes coins in a way that ensures privacy.Advantages of decentralized mixers include:No central point of failure or custody risk.Higher privacy because no single party controls the funds.Often more resistant to regulatory crackdowns.Did you know? The DOJ indicted four Russians for operating crypto mixers Blender.io and Sinbad.io, yet failed to show they knowingly laundered illicit funds. The indictment relies heavily on vague forum posts and lacks concrete evidence of criminal intent or ties to US commerce, raising serious doubts about its strength in court.                  Real-world cases involving mixers and scams              Unfortunately, the privacy offered by crypto mixers has also attracted criminals. The very anonymity that protects innocent users can also shield illicit activities, leading to widespread misuse.Crypto mixers have been linked to ransomware attacks, dark web marketplaces, fraud and drug trafficking. Criminals often use these services to “clean” proceeds from illegal transactions and hide their tracks from law enforcement.A notable example is ChipMixer, a service seized by Europol in 2023 for allegedly facilitating money laundering for dark web markets and ransomware groups. Authorities dismantled the platform’s infrastructure over alleged money laundering, seizing four servers, 1,909.4 BTC (about $210 million as of May 26, 2025) and seven TB of data across 55 transactions.Mixers have also been involved in laundering stolen funds from cryptocurrency exchange hacks. The complexity of these transactions makes it difficult for investigators to recover stolen assets.In February 2025, Bybit, a major cryptocurrency exchange, suffered a significant security breach resulting in the theft of about $1.5 billion worth of cryptocurrencies. The attackers, attributed to the Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking organization, employed various crypto mixers, including Wasabi, CryptoMixer, Railgun and Tornado Cash, to launder portions of the stolen assets. Despite efforts to trace the funds, a significant portion remains unaccounted for, highlighting the challenges posed by mixers in cybersecurity investigations.                  Are crypto mixers legal?              The legal status of cryptocurrency mixers depends largely on the jurisdiction and context of their use.Most governments impose strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing regulations on financial services, including digital currency services. Mixers, by their nature, complicate AML compliance because they obscure transaction trails.For instance,In the European Union, the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD) includes digital currency providers under its regulatory scope, requiring them to perform KYC checks and report suspicious activity.In the United States, FinCEN classifies cryptocurrency mixers as money transmitters, requiring registration and compliance with AML regulations. Unlicensed mixers can face severe penalties and criminal charges.Legal uses vs misuseUsing a mixer for privacy reasons is not inherently illegal. However, if mixers are used to launder proceeds from crimes, authorities will prosecute offenders. Similarly, operating a mixer without appropriate licenses or regulatory oversight can be illegal.If you choose to use a mixer, make sure you understand the legal implications in your country and avoid any activity that could be linked to money laundering or fraud.Did you know? Crypto mixer transactions are still taxable. Using a mixer doesn’t hide gains from tax authorities; failing to report them can trigger audits or penalties. Always keep records and understand your local tax obligations.                  How to stay safe and avoid scam-linked mixers              If you decide to use a cryptocurrency mixer, your safety and security should be paramount. Here are some essential tips to avoid scams and legal troubles:Choose reputable mixers: Conduct thorough research. Look for mixers with good reviews, transparent operations and clear compliance policies.Avoid unknown or suspicious services: Steer clear of mixers linked to scams, hacks or regulatory actions.Check for licensing and compliance: Prefer mixers that comply with AML/KYC regulations, especially if you are a business or high-value user.Understand fees and timelines: Be clear on the fees involved and the expected time for your funds to be returned after mixing.Use hardware wallets and strong security practices: Always safeguard your private keys and use hardware wallets to minimize risks.Stay updated on regulations: Laws surrounding crypto mixers evolve rapidly. Staying informed will help you avoid inadvertent legal violations.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-mixer-and-how-does-it-work?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T12:00:15.000Z,"StarkWare launches mobile-friendly zero-knowledge prover","Blockchain company StarkWare has unveiled zero-knowledge (ZK) prover STARK Two (S-two), enabling enhanced privacy and verification on everyday devices like phones, laptops and browsers. The company said the new ZK prover allows users to generate complex cryptographic proofs from the client side. This means users can generate ZK-proofs directly on their devices instead of relying on a server or cloud infrastructure, opening the door for faster and more private applications across the internet. “S-two will bring STARK proving to everyday devices, and open the door for new real-world proving use cases,” said Eli Ben-Sasson, StarkWare co-founder and CEO, adding that the tool could empower the next wave of ZK applications. The company said the ZK prover is now available in public alpha and is set to roll out on Starknet, its Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, later this year.  StarkWare says new ZK prover is 39 times faster than old solutions StarkWare said that benchmark tests for the S-two ZK prover showed that it was 39 times faster than previous solutions. The performance leap enables smoother experiences in privacy-enhancing applications. The upgrade also allows use cases in private transactions, ZK-based identity and verifiable artificial intelligence. StarkWare said S-two runs on CPUs, GPUs and will soon be on browsers. “For years we’ve called the prover our magic wand, a tool that transforms complex computation into a simple proof,” Ben-Sasson said. “Now, the wand has become a lightsaber in your pocket, something anyone can wield, instantly, from your own device.”According to StarkWare, developers can build with S-two, adding that its alpha release supports hardware targets. Furthermore, the company said ZK ecosystem participants like Kakarot, Nexus, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs have already adopted the technology. Kakarot uses S-two inside ETHProofs to generate Ethereum block proofs more efficiently, while Nexus is standardizing RISC-V traces to align with S-two’s architecture. Meanwhile, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs are adding GPU acceleration to push the prover’s performance even further.Use cases for S-two zero-knowledge proverStarkWare chief operating officer Oren Katz told Cointelegraph that S-two marks a shift in how ZK-proofs are used in daily lives. Generating validity proofs directly in devices will allow privacy-preserving features in messaging, payments and digital identity. “You can prove a payment was valid without showing your balance, or verify identity without revealing personal details,” Katz added. Katz said that even salary payments could be made onchain with full transparency and no exposure of sensitive information. He dubbed the development a “big step toward bringing zero-knowledge tech into the mainstream.”Beyond privacy, Katz said, local proof generation also unlocks use cases in other industries. The executive told Cointelegraph that it can allow gamers to play offline and later generate cryptographic proof of their achievements. “An operator, instead of running all logic onchain to prove integrity, can run it on their own servers and simply generate a proof that it was executed correctly,” Katz added.Related: Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden’s cashless-society rethinkNew ZK prover follows Ethereum’s privacy pushThe launch of StarWare’s upgraded ZK prover follows Ethereum’s push for better privacy.

2025-05-27T10:00:00.000Z,"Bitget enters real-world asset race with yield-bearing BGUSD stable asset","Crypto exchange Bitget has entered the expanding market for crypto investment products with the launch of BGUSD, a yield-bearing stable asset backed by tokenized real-world assets.The company announced that BGUSD offers an annual yield of 4%, which is credited daily to users’ spot accounts. Subscriptions to BGUSD can be made using either USDC (USDC) or USDt (USDT), and the asset is redeemable back to USDC on demand.The company said the yield is derived from a basket of tokenized instruments, including US Treasury bills and high-grade money-market funds. “These assets are managed via partnerships with regulated institutional tokenization providers such as Superstate,” Bitget CEO Gracy Chen told Cointelegraph.The product’s structure is designed to reduce exposure to crypto volatility while delivering returns through traditional financial instruments. Bitget to roll out third-party attestationsIn response to questions about transparency, Chen said that Bitget is preparing to roll out third-party attestations to provide visibility into BGUSD’s asset backing.“Transparency and accountability are core principles of BGUSD’s framework,” she said. “While independent attestations are in the works, our institutional partners are already subject to rigorous audit requirements and regulatory oversight.”Chen clarified how Bitget maintains liquidity for users who want to redeem BGUSD. The executive said Bitget directly manages the reserve pool, which includes stable, on-hand assets like USDC. According to Chen, BGUSD does not fall under the definitions of a stablecoin or a security and is not subject to specific licensing requirements. “It’s structured as a yield-bearing stable asset certificate that’s exclusive to the Bitget platform,” Chen told Cointelegraph.Chen added that Bitget will limit access to BGUSD in jurisdictions where digital asset restrictions apply.  Related: Stablecoins’ dominance due to limitations of US banking — Jerald DavidYield-bearing stablecoins surge to $11 billionBitget’s move into yield-bearing stablecoins comes as the asset class has surged to $11 billion. According to a Pendle report, yield-bearing stablecoins climbed from $1.5 billion at the start of 2024 to $11 billion as of May 21. This represents 4.5% of the entire stablecoin market. The growth of yield-bearing stablecoins is attributed to increasing regulatory clarity in the United States under President Donald Trump’s administration. According to a Feb. 18 filing, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved exchange operator Figure Markets’ interest-bearing stablecoin. This made the company the first to receive US approval for a yield-bearing stablecoin. Apart from a favorable response from the SEC, proposed bills like the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) also signal a positive direction for stablecoins in the US. Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitget-enters-real-world-asset-race-with-yield-bearing-bgusd-stablecoin?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
