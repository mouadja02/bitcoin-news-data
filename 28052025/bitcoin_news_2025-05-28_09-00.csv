2025-05-28T06:50:24.000Z,"MicroStrategy Stock Performance: Unstoppable MSTR Outpaces All 74 Crypto ETFs YTD","BitcoinWorld MicroStrategy Stock Performance: Unstoppable MSTR Outpaces All 74 Crypto ETFs YTD In a fascinating twist for digital asset investors, MicroStrategy stock performance has stolen the spotlight this year, achieving a feat many might find surprising. According to Nate Geraci, CEO of the U.S.-based wealth management firm The ETF Store, the company formerly known as Strategy has significantly outperformed every single one of the 74 crypto-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracked year-to-date. Understanding the Surprising MicroStrategy Stock Performance MicroStrategy (MSTR) is widely recognized not just as a business intelligence software company, but increasingly, as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin (BTC). This strategic pivot has tightly linked the company’s stock performance to the volatile world of cryptocurrency. While many investors seeking crypto exposure might turn to dedicated Crypto ETFs, MSTR’s stock has proven to be a more potent vehicle for gains in the current market cycle, at least so far this year. Nate Geraci’s observation, shared on X, highlights a significant trend: despite the proliferation of regulated investment products designed to track cryptocurrencies, a single company’s stock, heavily invested in Bitcoin, has managed to lead the pack. This includes funds specifically designed for leverage, such as the MSTR ETF (MSTX), which aims to track 2x the performance of MicroStrategy’s stock itself – yet, even this leveraged vehicle lagged behind the underlying MSTR shares. Why is MSTR vs Crypto ETFs Showing Such a Disparity? The outperformance of MicroStrategy stock compared to a broad spectrum of Crypto ETFs can be attributed to several factors: Concentrated Bitcoin Exposure: MSTR’s strategy is laser-focused on accumulating Bitcoin. While many crypto ETFs offer exposure to a basket of digital assets or Bitcoin futures, MSTR provides a more direct, albeit leveraged through its corporate structure, play on the price movement of the leading cryptocurrency. Investor Perception and Flow: For many investors, particularly institutional ones, buying MSTR stock is seen as a relatively accessible and regulated way to gain significant exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset or navigating the complexities of various crypto ETF structures. This consistent demand can drive the stock price. Business Operations Multiplier: While Bitcoin holdings are the primary driver of recent MSTR performance, the company still has an operational business. The market valuation of MSTR often reflects not just the value of its Bitcoin treasury, but also a premium placed on the company as a unique investment vehicle, potentially amplifying gains during bullish crypto cycles. ETF Structure and Fees: Crypto ETFs have varying structures (spot, futures, baskets) and come with management fees. These factors, along with potential tracking errors or diversification across less performing assets within a basket ETF, can dilute or lag the performance compared to a single, highly focused stock like MSTR during a strong Bitcoin rally. The Role of MicroStrategy as a Bitcoin Corporate Holder MicroStrategy pioneered the strategy of holding significant amounts of Bitcoin on its corporate balance sheet. Led by Michael Saylor, the company has aggressively acquired BTC, making it the most prominent Bitcoin Corporate Holder globally. This commitment has transformed MSTR into a de facto Bitcoin investment vehicle for many, influencing its market valuation far beyond its core software business. This unique position means that when Bitcoin’s price surges, MSTR’s stock tends to react strongly, often with amplified volatility compared to Bitcoin itself or diversified crypto funds. The market essentially values MSTR based heavily on its per-share Bitcoin holdings, plus a premium (or sometimes a discount) related to its operational business and debt used for acquisitions. What Does This Mean for Crypto ETF Performance and Investors? The fact that MSTR has outperformed 74 different Crypto ETFs highlights the diverse and sometimes complex landscape of digital asset investing: Not All Crypto Exposure is Equal: This performance gap underscores that different investment vehicles offering ‘crypto exposure’ can yield vastly different results due to structure, fees, underlying assets, and market dynamics. Due Diligence is Crucial: Investors considering crypto-related investments must look beyond just the ‘crypto’ label. Understanding the specific strategy, holdings, fees, and structure of an ETF – or the unique nature of a stock like MSTR – is vital. MSTR’s Unique Position: MSTR isn’t a typical tech stock anymore, nor is it a typical ETF. Its performance is a testament to its specific, high-conviction Bitcoin accumulation strategy and the market’s reaction to it. While Nate Geraci’s data point is compelling for year-to-date performance, it’s crucial for investors to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results. The dynamics that favored MSTR in the recent period could shift. Actionable Insights for Navigating MSTR and Crypto ETFs Given the insights from the recent Crypto ETF Performance data, here are some points for investors to consider: Understand Your Goal: Are you seeking broad crypto market exposure, specific Bitcoin exposure, or a leveraged play? Your goal should dictate your investment vehicle. Evaluate Structure and Risk: MSTR comes with corporate risk, debt risk (from borrowing to buy BTC), and stock market volatility in addition to Bitcoin price risk. ETFs have risks related to tracking error, counterparty exposure (especially futures ETFs), and management fees. Compare Fees: ETF expense ratios can eat into returns over time. While MSTR doesn’t have an explicit management fee like an ETF, its operational costs and debt financing have implications. Diversification: Relying heavily on a single stock like MSTR for crypto exposure concentrates risk. Crypto ETFs, even basket ones, can offer some level of diversification within the digital asset space, though this didn’t guarantee outperformance this year. Stay Informed: Follow experts like Nate Geraci and analyze the underlying drivers of performance for both individual stocks and ETFs. The story of MicroStrategy stock performance outpacing a wide array of Crypto ETFs this year serves as a powerful reminder that the path to digital asset exposure is multifaceted and requires careful consideration. Conclusion: A Surprising Leader in the Crypto Investment Race Nate Geraci’s observation that MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock has outperformed all 74 tracked crypto ETFs year-to-date is a significant data point in the evolving narrative of cryptocurrency investing. It underscores the unique position MicroStrategy holds as a Bitcoin Corporate Holder and the market’s current appetite for this specific type of leveraged Bitcoin exposure through a public company structure. While Crypto ETF Performance offers regulated and varied ways to access the digital asset market, MSTR’s concentrated bet on Bitcoin has delivered superior returns in the recent bullish environment. Investors should use this information to deepen their understanding of the different vehicles available, weigh the associated risks and benefits, and make informed decisions aligned with their own investment strategy.

Trading activity remains strong, with the volume at $129 billion, which has surged 19.59% overnight. Talking about sentiments of marketers, the Fear & Greed Index stands at a greed driven score of 68. However, the Altcoin Season Index at 23/100 indicates that Bitcoin remains the dominant force in the market. While Bitcoin continues to hold a firm grip on the market, the short-term volatility still puzzles not one but many. In this analysis, we see how Bitcoin has been doing behind the scenes, that is, onchain wise, and also explore Bitcoin price analysis for the short-term. Smart DCA and Holder Cost Basis Reflect Bullish Strength? As per the analysis by Axel , the ongoing Bitcoin bull cycle has seen a clear execution of the Smart Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy. All four buy triggers identified through cost-basis analysis have led to positive returns on investment, justifying the effectiveness of DCA in volatile markets. He highlights that the toughest buy point was Trigger #1, executed near the bear market bottom at $16k. Recent data from CryptoQuant further supports this bullish structure. Since Bitcoin reached the $97k mark, the realized cost basis for both short-term and long-term holders has started to climb higher. In particular, the 7-day rate of change for long-term holders has hit a cycle high, signaling strong conviction and reduced profit-taking from experienced investors.

2025-05-28T06:43:49.000Z,"Ripple’s Legal Chief Demands SEC Clear Rules to Fast-Track XRP ETFs","The post Ripple’s Legal Chief Demands SEC Clear Rules to Fast-Track XRP ETFs appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, has asked the SEC to give clear rules on how crypto tokens should be treated. In a letter to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force , Alderoty said most crypto tokens traded in the secondary market should not be treated as securities. This retaliation is seen as Ripple’s efforts to launch XRP ETFs this year , as without legal clarity, it will be further delayed, and it may give other assets an advantage over XRP. Right now, the market is ready to adopt XRP, and ETFs will boost its reach like they did for Bitcoin. BREAKING NEWS: RIPPLE CLO STUART ALDEROTY SAYS THAT „RIPPLE SUBMITTED AN ADDITIONAL LETTER TO THE SEC‘S CRYPTO TASK FORCE!“ #XRP https://t.co/MLOu861GDs pic.twitter.com/rpOpSNhNCA — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) May 27, 2025 XRP Ruling Supports the Case Referencing Judge Torres’s ruling in the SEC v. Ripple case, where the court said XRP sales on exchanges are not securities . He also mentioned a legal paper by Lewis Cohen, which says a token only counts as a security if there’s a clear relationship between the buyer and seller. This doesn’t happen when people trade tokens on exchanges. New Rules Should Come From Congress According to Alderoty, the SEC should not make new rules on its own. He believes Congress should be the one to create laws for the crypto market. He said that guidance based on existing laws would help clear up confusion for everyone. While acknowledging that crypto regulation still has gaps, Alderoty firmly stated that the SEC cannot create new rules on its own. Instead, he called on Congress to establish a legal framework tailored for the digital asset space. According to him, regulatory clarity must come from lawmakers, not regulators overstepping their authority. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP News: Why Did Ripple Submit An Additional Letter To Crypto Task Force? , Possible Scenario for Security Status Meanwhile, Ripple has suggested using a ‘network maturity’ test to help decide if a crypto token should still be treated like a security. This test looks at things like how big the project has become, how long it has been running, and how control is spread out. Ripple says a token should only be considered a security if two things happen at the same time: if the original promises from the issuer haven’t been fulfilled, and if the current holder has legal rights to those promises. If not, the token should be treated separately from the original investment contract. This move is seen as part of Ripple’s effort to clear the legal path for a possible future ETF. The Push for Fairer Crypto Rules Grows This request from Ripple follows similar calls from the Blockchain Association and others who want the SEC to stop applying traditional finance rules to crypto. With big names like BlackRock also talking to the SEC’s Crypto Task Force , the push for better rules is only getting stronger. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-28T06:43:24.000Z,"Bitcoin Outlook & New Stablecoin Investment Opportunities Amidst Evolving Macro Landscape","Singapore, May 27, 2025 – HTX Research, the research arm of HTX, has just released a crucial new report: “ The New Macroeconomic Landscape and Bitcoin Outlook: An Analysis of Liquidity, Risk Appetite, Policy Dynamics, and Investment Strategy. “ This comprehensive analysis comes at a pivotal time, as the global macroeconomic landscape undergoes profound shifts and the cryptocurrency market, especially Bitcoin’s price movements, becomes increasingly influenced by this complex backdrop. The report offers investors valuable insights, a clear market outlook, and strategic investment guidance on how evolving macroeconomic conditions are shaping the Bitcoin market. Bitcoin Outlook in the Macro Environment: Liquidity & Market Risk Appetite The current global macro environment is complex. A combination of factors, including cooling expectations for Fed rate cuts, ongoing quantitative tightening (QT), the replenishment of the U.S. Treasury General Account (TGA), and anticipated rate hikes by the Bank of Japan, are collectively contributing to tighter short-term liquidity. Over the medium term (3–12 months), liquidity is expected to gradually improve. However, uncertainty surrounding market risk appetite presents both opportunities and challenges for the Bitcoin market. Policy Tug-of-War Signals Crypto-Friendly Shifts: A Loosening Grip on Stablecoin Regulation? The ongoing policy debate is having a significant impact on the crypto market. In a notable development, Hong Kong’s Legislative Council has passed the Stablecoin Bill, which establishes a comprehensive licensing regime for fiat-backed stablecoin issuers in Hong Kong. This legislation further refines the regulatory framework for virtual asset activities within the region, aiming to foster financial stability and consumer protection. The more profound and complex policy impacts are unfolding in the United States. The Trump administration’s “Big Beautiful Tax Plan”, aimed at reducing taxes by $5 trillion over the next decade, has boosted market sentiment in the short term. However, the growing fiscal deficit and debt ceiling issues could spark liquidity volatility. Regarding regulation, the U.S. Senate is making progress on stablecoin legislation. The GENIUS Act seeks to establish a standardized framework for the stablecoin market, mandating backing by 100% high-quality asset reserves. Negotiations have reportedly reached a consensus on approximately 90% of the terms, signaling a strong bipartisan push for regulatory clarity in this critical sector. Additionally, the accelerated exploration of tokenized U.S. equities is noteworthy, with the U.S. SEC is actively researching and evaluating this space, while major financial institutions (e.g., JPMorgan) are strategically positioning themselves in this emerging field. Furthermore, U.S. federal and state initiatives to legislate “strategic Bitcoin reserves,” such as New Hampshire’s H.B. 302 bill, are further elevating Bitcoin’s strategic importance and providing policy support for increased institutional participation.These developments collectively indicate a growing recognition and integration of digital assets within traditional financial and governmental structures. HTX Lists USD1 and Other Compliant Stablecoins, Introduces Zero-Fee Conversion With global policy easing on the horizon and a growing push for regulatory clarity, stablecoins are increasingly solidifying their role as the foundation of liquidity and value pegs within the crypto market. Recognizing this pivotal opportunity, HTX has recently launched a range of compliant stablecoins, including USD1 (World Liberty Financial USD), USDQ (Quantoz), EURQ (Quantoz), USDR (StablR), EURR (StablR),and AETHUSDT (Aave Ethereum USDT). This expansion is designed to meet diverse user investment preferences and boost capital efficiency. To celebrate the launch of USD1 and reduce barriers to user participation, HTX is offering a special zero-fee conversion service. From now until December 31, 2025, at 15:59 (UTC), users can trade the USD1/USDT spot pair with no trading fees. This initiative ensures users incur no additional costs during conversion, thereby maximizing their capital utilization. The report concludes that the Bitcoin market may encounter liquidity pressures and volatility risks in the short term. However, the medium to long term holds significant potential for a rebound. This optimistic outlook is largely supported by clearer regulatory policies and growing institutional adoption. .

2025-05-28T06:40:20.000Z,"Bitcoin Season: Altcoin Season Index at 25 Signals Crucial Crypto Market Insight","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Season: Altcoin Season Index at 25 Signals Crucial Crypto Market Insight Are you navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrency ? Understanding market cycles is crucial, and one key indicator investors watch is the Altcoin Season Index . This metric provides valuable insight into whether Bitcoin or altcoins are currently leading the charge in the broader crypto market . What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index, tracked by platforms like CoinMarketCap, is a tool designed to measure the relative performance of altcoins compared to Bitcoin over a specific period. It helps participants in the crypto market understand the prevailing trend – whether it’s a period where altcoins are generally outperforming Bitcoin (Altcoin Season) or vice versa ( Bitcoin Season ). Here’s how the index generally works: It typically analyzes the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens. The comparison is made against Bitcoin’s performance over a set timeframe, often the past 90 days. The index score is usually represented on a scale, commonly from 1 to 100. Decoding the Index Score: Altcoin Season vs. Bitcoin Season The index score directly indicates which ‘season’ the crypto market is in. Based on the commonly accepted criteria: Altcoin Season: This occurs when a significant majority of the top altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the measured period. The threshold is often set at 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins showing better performance than BTC. An index score typically above 75 signifies Altcoin Season. Bitcoin Season: This is the opposite scenario. It happens when Bitcoin is largely outperforming the majority of altcoins. The threshold is often set at 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins outperforming BTC. An index score typically below 25 signifies Bitcoin Season . Neither Season: Scores between these thresholds (e.g., 26-74) suggest a period where the market is more mixed, with no clear dominance by either Bitcoin or altcoins as a whole. Why the Index at 25 Signals Bitcoin Season As reported, the Altcoin Season Index recently registered a score of 25. According to the standard criteria used by many market trackers, including CoinMarketCap, a score of 25 or below indicates that 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. This firmly places the current crypto market environment in Bitcoin Season . This score, remaining unchanged recently, reinforces the observation that Bitcoin has been the dominant performer relative to most altcoins over the last three months. While individual altcoins may have seen pumps, the broad market trend among the top players favors BTC. What Does Bitcoin Season Mean for Your Cryptocurrency Investments? Being in Bitcoin Season has several implications for participants in the crypto market : Focus on Bitcoin: Historically, during Bitcoin Season, capital tends to flow disproportionately into Bitcoin. This can lead to BTC’s price appreciating faster than many altcoins, and its market dominance increasing. Altcoin Underperformance: Many altcoins may trade sideways, experience smaller gains, or even decline against their BTC pair during this period. Potential Opportunities: While challenging for broad altcoin gains, Bitcoin Season can present opportunities to accumulate promising altcoins at lower prices relative to Bitcoin, in anticipation of a future shift back to Altcoin Season. Risk Management: Investing heavily in smaller, less established altcoins during Bitcoin Season can carry higher risk, as their performance is often more volatile and susceptible to downturns when Bitcoin is leading. Understanding this market phase helps investors align their strategies. It’s a time when a ‘buy the dip’ approach might be more effective for Bitcoin, or when selectively choosing altcoins with strong fundamentals becomes even more critical. What Factors Contribute to Bitcoin Season? Several factors can contribute to the crypto market entering and staying in Bitcoin Season : Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of global economic uncertainty, investors often view Bitcoin as a relatively safer haven within the volatile crypto space compared to smaller altcoins. Institutional Interest: Large institutional investors often enter the market through Bitcoin first due to its liquidity and established infrastructure (like Bitcoin ETFs). Their significant capital inflows primarily boost BTC. Halving Cycles: The Bitcoin halving event often precedes or coincides with periods of increased Bitcoin dominance, as attention and capital flow towards BTC in anticipation of supply reduction. Market Sentiment: A general shift in sentiment favoring larger, more established assets can benefit Bitcoin over riskier altcoins. Profit-Taking from Altcoins: After a period of altcoin gains, investors may take profits and rotate capital back into Bitcoin, which is seen as more stable. When Could the Market Shift Back to Altcoin Season? Predicting the exact timing of a shift from Bitcoin Season back to Altcoin Season is impossible, but certain indicators can signal a potential change: Increasing Altcoin Outperformance: The most direct signal is when a growing number of altcoins start consistently outperforming Bitcoin over the 90-day period, causing the Altcoin Season Index to rise significantly (towards 75+). Decreasing Bitcoin Dominance: While not the same as the index, a sustained drop in Bitcoin’s market dominance (its percentage of the total crypto market cap) often precedes or accompanies Altcoin Season. Breakout in Specific Altcoin Categories: Often, a new Altcoin Season is kicked off by strong performance in specific sectors like DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2 solutions, or specific narratives. Increased Retail Interest: Altcoin seasons are often fueled by renewed interest and capital from retail investors, who tend to gravitate towards the potential for higher percentage gains in altcoins. Positive Market Catalysts: Favorable regulatory news, technological breakthroughs in major altcoin projects, or a sustained period of bullish momentum in the overall market can trigger altcoin rallies. Investors should monitor the Altcoin Season Index and other market indicators closely for signs of this potential shift. It typically doesn’t happen overnight but evolves gradually. Challenges and Nuances of the Altcoin Season Index While a useful tool, the Altcoin Season Index isn’t perfect and has its nuances: Historical Data Reliance: It’s based on past 90-day performance, meaning it reflects the recent past and present, not necessarily predicting the future. Top 100 Limitation: The index only considers the top 100 coins. Many smaller cap altcoins might experience significant pumps during Bitcoin Season that aren’t reflected in this specific index. Market Cap Weighting: The index treats each of the top 100 coins equally in its calculation of outperformance percentage, regardless of their individual market capitalization. Definition Variations: Different platforms might use slightly different methodologies or thresholds for defining Altcoin vs. Bitcoin Season . Therefore, while the index provides a valuable high-level view of the crypto market trend, it should be used in conjunction with other analysis tools and research. Actionable Insights for the Current Bitcoin Season Given the current Altcoin Season Index reading of 25, here are some actionable insights for investors navigating the cryptocurrency space: Prioritize Bitcoin: Consider allocating a larger portion of your portfolio to Bitcoin, or focus on dollar-cost averaging into BTC during this period. Be Selective with Altcoins: If investing in altcoins, be highly selective. Focus on projects with strong fundamentals, clear use cases, active development, and solid community support. Avoid highly speculative or meme coins unless you understand the significant risks involved. Monitor Bitcoin Dominance: Keep an eye on Bitcoin’s market dominance chart. A significant downturn could be an early warning sign of capital rotating into altcoins. Watch the Index: Continuously monitor the Altcoin Season Index . A sustained move upwards is the most direct signal that the market sentiment is shifting. Educate Yourself: Use this time to research potential altcoin investments for when the season eventually shifts. Understanding projects deeply will position you better to capitalize on future altcoin rallies. Conclusion: Navigating the Current Crypto Market The Altcoin Season Index currently sitting at 25 provides a clear signal: the crypto market is experiencing Bitcoin Season . This means that over the past 90 days, Bitcoin has largely outperformed the vast majority of the top 100 altcoins. Understanding this phase is vital for investors to manage risk and identify potential opportunities. While the focus is currently on Bitcoin’s performance, market cycles are dynamic. The shift back to Altcoin Season is inevitable at some point, driven by various factors like changing sentiment, institutional flows, or specific altcoin innovations. By staying informed, monitoring key indicators like the Altcoin Season Index , and applying a strategic approach, investors can navigate the current environment and prepare for future shifts in the exciting world of cryptocurrency .

2025-05-28T06:38:53.000Z,"Crypto Czar slammed anti-crypto Senator Warren","Crypto Czar David Sacks slams anti-crypto Senator Elizabeth Warren, saying she, for some reason, has a hatred for the crypto community. He noted that Warren wants to drive the crypto community offshore, and she doesn’t prefer it happening in the U.S. Sacks argued that it was the wrong policy for the U.S. and wanted all the innovation happening in the country. He also acknowledged that crypto is the financial system of the future, and the U.S. has to encourage it. Warren questions Sack’s role in Trump’s administration SHHH DON’T TELL JOE! @DavidSacks just said POCAHONTAS had the AUTOPEN and wasn’t afraid to use it! ✍🏼✍🏼✍🏼 pic.twitter.com/KSUL4WQ4i6 — Jesse Watters (@JesseBWatters) May 28, 2025 Senator Warren has previously called for greater transparency in David Sack’s role as Donald Trump administration’s crypto and artificial intelligence advisor. In a March 6 letter , she urged Sacks to prove that he was not personally profiting from policies that favor select digital currencies, weaken regulatory oversight, and ease enforcement actions against the crypto industry. Warren argued that Americans deserve strong leaders who prioritize the public interest ahead of their bottom lines. She noted in the letter that Sacks had previously stated he offloaded his holdings in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana before taking up his government role. Warren also demanded specific details on the sales and confirmation of when Sack’s investment firm, Craft Ventures, exited its position in Bitwise Investment. Sacks refuted the claims and said he had a $74K position in Bitwise, which he offloaded on January 22. He also confirmed he sold his stake in crypto investment firm Multicoin Capital. The Senator of Massachusetts also requested information on how the Sacks had addressed potential conflicts of interest and how he would prevent the President and other private individuals from directly profiting off the Trump administration’s efforts to pump the value of certain virtual currencies. Warren asked for details on whether Sacks had filed financial disclosures with the Office of Government Ethics. She also requested the specific plans in place at the White House to ensure that individuals developing crypto policy comply with all federal conflict of interest rules. The Senator of Massachusetts has criticized the Securities and Exchange Commission for dropping its legal cases against major crypto companies, including Coinbase, Robinhood, and Kraken. She has also raised concerns over the agency declaring that most memecoins are not securities, which she believes could benefit speculative assets, including Trump’s official token. Warren argued that those actions could benefit billionaire investors, Trump administration insiders, and speculators at the expense of middle-class families. Senator Warren also scrutinized Paul Atkins’ connections to the digital asset industry in late March, accusing Trump’s pick of having financial conflicts. She noted during Atkins’ confirmation hearing before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, arguing there were steps he could take to commit to a higher standard of government ethics. The Massachusetts senator also criticized the stablecoin bill, accusing Trump of using legislation to further his financial interests. She shared the critique while linking a post about President Trump’s decentralized finance project, World Liberty Financial, launching its stablecoin USD1 on Ethereum and Binance’s BNB Chain. Warren wants strong anti-money laundering protections on crypto Senator Warren noted at a U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on May 2 that the national security threat posed by not properly regulating crypto, including the inadvertent funding of rogue nations. She believes that bad players are using digital assets to evade U.S. sanctions without proper anti-money laundering regulations, generating millions of dollars annually by acting as middlemen in the crypto industry. “Anything Congress does to legitimize and grow the crypto market must have strong protections so we do not increase money-making opportunities for Iran and other adversaries.” – Elizabeth Warren , Senator of Massachusetts. The American politician questioned Avril Haines, Director of National Intelligence, about Iran’s ability to avoid sanctions using crypto and how digital assets strengthen American adversaries. Haines argued that Iran is using crypto to move millions of dollars around and also explained that over 50% of North Korean foreign currency revenues now come from crypto. Warren also questioned Lieutenant General Jeffrey Kruse of the U.S. Air Force about the importance of cutting off crypto as a revenue source for foreign adversaries. Kruse argued that Iran having crypto as an additional revenue gives them more discretionary spending power. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-05-28T06:30:39.000Z,"Decoding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index: Why 71 in ‘Greed’ Zone Signals Caution","BitcoinWorld Decoding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index: Why 71 in ‘Greed’ Zone Signals Caution Navigating the volatile world of digital assets requires more than just watching charts; understanding the collective mood of the market is crucial. This is where the Crypto Fear and Greed Index comes into play, offering a snapshot of prevailing crypto market sentiment . Understanding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index Provided by Alternative, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a unique tool designed to measure the emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Emotions like fear can lead to impulsive selling, while greed can push investors towards buying sprees, potentially leading to market bubbles. By quantifying these emotions, the index aims to help investors make more informed decisions rather than being swayed purely by sentiment. The index operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Indicates significant undervaluation and potential buying opportunities. 25-49: Fear – Suggests market participants are worried, potentially suppressing prices. 50: Neutral – The market is balanced between fear and greed. 51-74: Greed – Points to increasing optimism and potentially overvalued conditions. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Often signals a market top or bubble, where a correction might be imminent. As of May 28th, the index stands at 71, firmly placing it in the ‘Greed’ zone, although it saw a slight dip of three points from the previous day. This suggests that while optimism remains high, there might be a minor cooling or consolidation occurring. What Factors Influence the Index? The index is not based on a single metric but aggregates data from six key factors, each weighted differently to provide a comprehensive view of cryptocurrency news and sentiment: Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and max drawdown of Bitcoin compared to its average values over the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility driven by price pumps often indicates a greedy market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares the current volume and market momentum (price action) to average values. High buying volume in a positive market suggests greedy or bullish behavior. Social Media (15%): Analyzes specific hashtags and sentiment analysis on platforms like Twitter. High engagement and positive sentiment around certain coins can indicate growing greed. Surveys (15%): Gathers data from weekly sentiment surveys (currently paused). This factor captures direct opinions from market participants. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Rising Bitcoin dominance can sometimes signal fear (as investors move to the perceived safety of BTC) or, conversely, increasing greed (as BTC leads a bull run). Google Trends (10%): Looks at search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Spikes in search terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “Bitcoin bubble” can indicate fear, while terms like “buy Bitcoin” or specific altcoin searches can signal greed. Interpreting ‘Greed’ at 71: What Does it Mean for the Market? A reading of 71 signifies that market participants are generally optimistic and confident. In the context of Bitcoin price and other cryptocurrencies, this level of greed can indicate several things: Bullish Momentum: Prices have likely been trending upwards, fueling positive sentiment. Increased Buying Pressure: More people are willing to buy, potentially even at higher prices, driven by fear of missing out (FOMO). Potential for Correction: Historically, periods of extreme greed have often preceded market pullbacks or corrections. A high reading suggests the market might be getting ahead of itself. The slight drop from 74 to 71 could suggest a minor pause in this upward sentiment, perhaps due to short-term price fluctuations or specific news events. It’s a reminder that sentiment can shift quickly. How Can the Crypto Fear and Greed Index Inform Your Investing Strategy? While the index is a valuable sentiment tool, it should not be the sole basis for your investing strategy . Think of it as a complementary indicator: Contrarian Approach: Some investors use the index contrarianly – buying during extreme fear (when prices are low) and considering selling or reducing positions during extreme greed (when prices are high). A reading of 71 is in the ‘Greed’ zone, suggesting caution might be warranted rather than aggressive buying. Confirmation Tool: Use the index to confirm signals from other analysis methods (e.g., technical analysis, fundamental analysis). If technical indicators suggest a potential pullback and the index shows high greed, it strengthens the case for caution. Risk Management: A high greed score can be a reminder to manage risk, perhaps by taking some profits, setting stop-losses, or avoiding over-leveraging. It’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is influenced by numerous factors, and sentiment is just one piece of the puzzle. Economic news, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and global events all play significant roles. Challenges and Limitations No single indicator is perfect. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has its limitations: Lagging Indicator: Sentiment often follows price action rather than predicting it perfectly. Simplification: It boils down complex market dynamics into a single number. Data Sources: The weighting and specific data sources used by Alternative are proprietary, making it difficult to independently verify its accuracy or anticipate shifts. Not a Crystal Ball: A high greed score doesn’t guarantee a crash, just as extreme fear doesn’t guarantee a bottom. Conclusion: Staying Informed in a Greedy Market The Crypto Fear & Greed Index currently sitting at 71 in the ‘Greed’ zone reflects a market buoyed by optimism and positive momentum. While this can be encouraging for holders, it also serves as a valuable reminder to approach the market with prudence. High levels of greed have historically coincided with periods where market corrections become more likely. By understanding the factors that drive the index and using it in conjunction with other analysis tools, investors can better navigate the emotional tides of the crypto market and refine their investing strategy . Stay informed, stay analytical, and avoid letting pure emotion dictate your decisions.

The Jack Dorsey-founded company revealed the move at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 27, where the new feature was showcased at the BTC Inc. merchandise store. The rollout is expected to begin in the second half of 2025, with full availability anticipated in 2026 for all eligible Square sellers, pending regulatory approvals. The feature will allow merchants using Square hardware to accept Bitcoin payments via the Lightning Network, Bitcoin’s layer-2 protocol designed for faster and lower-cost micro transactions. Customers will be able to pay by scanning a QR code, while Square’s backend handles the real-time exchange rate calculation and confirmation, enabling near-instant settlement. Merchants can choose to receive Bitcoin directly or convert it into fiat currency automatically at the point of sale. The update builds on Square’s earlier Bitcoin Conversion tool, introduced in 2024, which gave merchants the option to allocate a portion of their daily sales to Bitcoin without manual intervention. As of April 2025, Square reportedly serves nearly 4 million merchants, making it the leading U.S. merchant acquirer by number of sellers. You might also like: Jack Dorsey’s Block to pay $40m over compliance failures on Cash App According to Miles Suter, Bitcoin Product Lead at Block, the new capability marks a major step toward fulfilling Bitcoin’s original purpose as a peer-to-peer payment system. “Rolling out a native bitcoin experience to millions of sellers brings us one step closer to that goal,” Suter said, adding that the goal is to provide faster payments and greater revenue control for small businesses. “We believe in an open, decentralized, fair, fast, and low-cost money system for everyone, and that’s exactly what we want to bring to Square sellers,” Suter added. Bitcoin payments on Square mark a strategic extension of Block’s broader push to embed Bitcoin into everyday finance, complementing its self-custody wallet Bitkey, its decentralised mining venture Proto, open-source development arm Spiral, and Cash App’s growing role in retail Bitcoin adoption. The launch of Bitcoin payments comes after earlier remarks by CEO Jack Dorsey, who in April said that Bitcoin risked becoming irrelevant if it failed to transition from a store of value to a functional payment method. At the time, Dorsey confirmed the company was actively working on enabling Bitcoin payments through Square and Bitkey . The launch of Bitcoin payments on Square follows a challenging period for Block. In early 2024, the company laid off approximately 1,000 employees, and in March, it cut an additional 931 jobs following weaker-than-expected earnings for Q4 2023.

Sacks told Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss during a May 27 fireside chat at the Bitcoin 2025 conference that while he “can’t promise anything,” a pathway does exist for the government to buy more Bitcoin ( BTC ). However, it would require convincing Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick or Treasury Secretary Scott Besson to OK the buy and fund it “without a new tax or adding to the debt,” Sacks said, adding that “maybe by finding the money from some other program that’s not using it — then we could potentially acquire more Bitcoin.” David Sacks said the US could buy more Bitcoin, but he can’t make any promises. Source: YouTube “The question is, can we get either the Treasury Department or the Commerce Department to get excited about that because if they do and they can figure out how to fund it, they actually do have presidential authorization,” Sacks said.

According to a report by Bitcoin Magazine on X, Mitchnick stated unequivocally that “Bitcoin has much higher upside than gold.” This simple yet powerful assertion from a representative of a firm that recently launched one of the most successful spot Bitcoin ETFs (IBIT) underscores a notable shift in how traditional finance views the premier cryptocurrency. Why is this particular statement significant? BlackRock manages trillions of dollars in assets. Their strategic decisions and public commentary often signal broader trends in institutional investment. Mitchnick’s role as a Managing Director suggests he is involved in key areas, likely including the firm’s digital asset initiatives. Therefore, his comparison isn’t merely speculative; it’s likely informed by internal analysis and market perspective from a firm deeply engaged with both traditional and digital asset classes. For years, gold has been the go-to asset for investors seeking a store of value and a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Bitcoin emerged with a similar narrative, often dubbed “digital gold.” The debate about which asset serves this purpose better, and more importantly, which offers greater growth prospects, has been central to crypto discussions. Mitchnick’s comment directly addresses the growth potential, favoring Bitcoin. Why is the “Bitcoin vs Gold” Debate Heating Up? The comparison between Bitcoin vs Gold is fundamental to understanding Bitcoin’s investment thesis, especially for traditional investors. Both assets are viewed as scarce, decentralized stores of value outside the direct control of governments or central banks. However, their characteristics and market dynamics differ significantly, leading to varying perspectives on their future performance. Let’s look at some key points of comparison: Scarcity and Supply: Gold supply increases slowly through mining, with no absolute cap known. Bitcoin has a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, enforced by its protocol. This verifiable, absolute scarcity is a core argument for its long-term value potential. Divisibility and Portability: Bitcoin is highly divisible (down to 8 decimal places, called satoshis) and instantly portable across the globe with minimal cost (relatively, depending on network conditions). Gold is less divisible and costly to transport and store securely. Verifiability: The authenticity of Bitcoin can be cryptographically verified on the blockchain. Verifying gold often requires physical inspection and expertise. Market Size and Liquidity: The gold market is vastly larger and more mature than the Bitcoin market. However, Bitcoin’s market depth and liquidity have grown dramatically, particularly with the advent of spot ETFs. Volatility: Historically, Bitcoin has been far more volatile than gold. This volatility presents both higher risk and potentially higher reward, contributing to the “higher upside” argument. Institutional Adoption: While institutions have held gold for centuries, their adoption of Bitcoin is a relatively new but accelerating trend. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. is a prime example of increasing institutional access and interest. Here’s a simplified comparison table: Feature Bitcoin (BTC) Gold (XAU) Supply Cap Fixed (21 million) No fixed cap (mined) Nature Digital Physical Divisibility Highly divisible (Satoshi) Less divisible Portability Easy, Global Difficult, Costly Verification Cryptographic (Blockchain) Physical inspection Volatility High Low to Moderate Institutional Adoption Growing Rapidly Established Mitchnick’s comment suggests that despite gold’s long history, the unique digital properties and market dynamics of Bitcoin position it for potentially greater future appreciation, largely because it is starting from a smaller base and benefits from network effects and increasing digital integration. Exploring Bitcoin’s Potential: Is Skyrocketing Price Growth Possible? The idea of significant Bitcoin price potential is central to the investment thesis for many holders. Several factors contribute to the belief that Bitcoin’s price could see substantial future growth, perhaps even dwarfing gold’s historical returns. Supply Halvings: Approximately every four years, the rate at which new Bitcoin enters circulation is cut in half. This programmed supply shock, while demand either remains constant or increases, has historically preceded significant price rallies. Increasing Demand: Demand is growing from multiple fronts – individual retail investors, corporations adding BTC to their balance sheets, and perhaps most significantly, large financial institutions offering Bitcoin products or investing directly. Institutionalization: The launch of easy-to-access investment vehicles like spot Bitcoin ETFs opens the door for a massive pool of capital that was previously hesitant or unable to invest in Bitcoin directly. This influx of institutional money is a powerful potential catalyst. Macroeconomic Landscape: In an era of potential inflation, currency devaluation, and economic uncertainty, the narrative of Bitcoin as a scarce, decentralized store of value becomes more appealing to a wider audience. Network Effects: As more users, developers, and businesses adopt Bitcoin, its utility and value as a network increase, creating a positive feedback loop. Comparing this to gold, gold’s price movements are typically more tied to inflation fears, currency strength, and jewelry/industrial demand. While it serves its purpose as a stable store of value, the structural factors driving potential exponential growth in Bitcoin (like halvings and rapid technological adoption) are simply not present in the gold market. Mitchnick’s perspective aligns with the view that Bitcoin, being a younger, more dynamic asset class with unique supply dynamics and growing global digital adoption, has a longer runway for appreciation than the established, mature gold market. The percentage growth required for Bitcoin to reach a market capitalization comparable to gold’s is significantly higher, implying substantial price increases per coin if that convergence were to occur. How is Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Shaping the Market? The trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption is arguably the most significant development in the crypto space over the past few years. What started with a few pioneering corporate treasuries has expanded dramatically, bringing legitimacy, liquidity, and new capital into the market. BlackRock itself is a prime example. Their iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) quickly became one of the most successful ETF launches in history by assets under management. This wasn’t just about offering a product; it represented BlackRock putting its significant weight and reputation behind making Bitcoin accessible to a vast network of financial advisors and their clients. Beyond ETFs, institutions are engaging in various ways: Direct Investment: Some corporations and investment funds are holding Bitcoin directly on their balance sheets. Custody Solutions: The development of robust, regulated custody solutions has made it safer and more feasible for institutions to hold significant amounts of Bitcoin. Derivatives Markets: Growth in Bitcoin futures and options markets provides institutions with tools for hedging and speculation. Lending and Borrowing: Institutional-grade platforms for Bitcoin lending and borrowing are emerging. Venture Capital: Significant VC funding continues to pour into companies building infrastructure and services in the crypto space. The impact of this institutional embrace is multifaceted. It increases market liquidity, potentially reduces long-term volatility (as institutional holders tend to be long-term players), builds credibility for the asset class, and integrates Bitcoin further into the global financial system. When executives from firms like BlackRock speak positively about Bitcoin, it reinforces this trend and can influence other institutions and traditional investors. What Does This Mean for the Overall Crypto Market Outlook? The positive commentary from a BlackRock executive about Bitcoin’s potential has broader implications for the entire crypto market outlook . Bitcoin often acts as the gateway asset for institutions and new investors entering the space. Increased confidence and investment in Bitcoin can have a halo effect on other cryptocurrencies and the broader digital asset ecosystem. A positive outlook for Bitcoin suggests continued interest in the underlying technology (blockchain) and other digital assets. It validates the idea that digital assets are evolving from a niche interest to a recognized asset class with a place in diversified portfolios. However, the crypto market outlook is not without its challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies remains fragmented and uncertain across different jurisdictions. Clarity is needed for broader institutional comfort. Market Volatility: While institutional money might temper volatility over time, the crypto market is known for sharp price swings driven by sentiment, news, and macroeconomic factors. Technological Risks: While Bitcoin’s protocol has proven robust, risks related to exchanges, custody providers, or potential future technological shifts exist. Global Economic Factors: The performance of crypto assets can be influenced by interest rates, inflation, and global economic stability, just like traditional assets. Despite these challenges, the increasing institutional validation, highlighted by comments like Mitchnick’s, points towards a future where digital assets play a more prominent role in global finance. The focus remains heavily on Bitcoin as the leading institutional-grade asset, but the infrastructure and understanding built around it benefit the wider market. Weighing the Benefits and Challenges of Bitcoin Investment Investing in Bitcoin, especially with the perspective of its high growth potential compared to assets like gold, comes with a unique set of benefits and challenges. It’s crucial for any potential investor to understand both sides. Benefits: High Growth Potential: As highlighted by the BlackRock executive, the potential for significant price appreciation due to limited supply, increasing demand, and network effects is a major draw. Decentralization: Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network, meaning it is not controlled by any single entity, offering a degree of autonomy from traditional financial systems. Store of Value: Its fixed supply and resistance to inflation make it an attractive potential store of value, particularly in uncertain economic times. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin can be sent and received anywhere in the world with an internet connection, offering financial inclusion and ease of transfer. Transparency: All Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger (the blockchain), providing a level of transparency not found in traditional finance. Challenges: Extreme Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings in short periods, leading to significant risk of loss. Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of clear, consistent regulation globally creates legal and operational risks. Security Risks: While the network is secure, individual investors face risks from exchange hacks, phishing scams, and losing private keys. Complexity: Understanding the technology, market dynamics, and secure storage methods can be challenging for newcomers. Market Manipulation: Although decreasing with institutional involvement, the market can still be susceptible to manipulation. The decision to invest should weigh the potential for high returns against these considerable risks. The perspective from BlackRock emphasizes the upside, but prudent investors must consider the full picture. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Bitcoin Landscape Given the evolving landscape and the insights from major financial players, what steps can individuals take? Educate Yourself: Understand how Bitcoin works, its history, market cycles, and the technology behind it. Don’t rely solely on headlines or single opinions. Define Your Goals and Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin is not suitable for everyone. Assess if its volatility and long-term potential align with your personal financial goals and comfort level with risk. Start Small: If you decide to invest, consider starting with a small amount you are comfortable losing. Consider Your Investment Method: Decide whether direct ownership (managing your own keys) or using regulated products like ETFs (offering convenience and familiar structures) is better suited for you. Prioritize Security: If holding Bitcoin directly, learn about and use secure storage solutions like hardware wallets. Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication on exchanges. Stay Informed: Follow reliable news sources and analysis on the crypto market, regulatory developments, and technological advancements. Think Long-Term: Many investors view Bitcoin as a long-term asset. Short-term price swings can be significant, but the long-term trend has historically been upward. Comments from figures like Robert Mitchnick provide valuable context from the institutional world, but individual research and a clear strategy are paramount. Conclusion Robert Mitchnick’s statement that Bitcoin offers greater price growth potential than gold is a powerful indicator of how perspectives on digital assets are shifting within traditional finance. Coming from a leader at BlackRock, a firm deeply embedded in both traditional markets and increasingly in the crypto space, the comment underscores a growing institutional belief in Bitcoin’s future. The debate between Bitcoin vs Gold as a store of value continues, but the focus is clearly moving towards which asset offers superior potential returns in the digital age. Bitcoin’s unique characteristics—fixed supply, digital nature, growing institutional adoption, and dynamic market cycles—position it differently from the mature gold market. While the path forward for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market outlook involves navigating significant volatility and regulatory hurdles, the increasing validation from major financial institutions suggests that digital assets are here to stay and are being seriously considered for their long-term growth prospects. Investors should view such comments as valuable insights, but always couple them with thorough personal research and a clear understanding of the inherent risks involved in this exciting, yet unpredictable, market.

Guo will face the court on “allegations relating to multiple breaches of his directors’ duties,” the Australian Securities and Investments Commission said in a May 28 press release. ASIC alleged Guo made multiple breaches of directors’ duties relating to his dealings with ACX Exchange customer funds, and claimed he made false and misleading statements about those dealings and failed to maintain proper books and records. The now-liquidated Blockchain Global operated the ACX Exchange from mid-2016 until December 2019, when it collapsed as customers could no longer withdraw their assets. During liquidator’s examinations in 2022, the courts were told that ACX exchange took the cash invested by its customers to buy crypto and mingled the funds into one pooled fund, the Sydney Morning Herald reported at the time. The liquidators of Blockchain Global estimate that the company owed over 20 million Australian dollars ($12.8 million) in unsecured creditor claims to former customers of the ACX Exchange, ASIC said. In November 2023, liquidators reported that Blockchain Global had 58.6 million Australian dollars ($37.7 million) owed to unsecured creditors. Of that total, 22.7 million Australian dollars ($14.6 million) were unsecured creditor claims received from former customers of the crypto exchange .

2025-05-28T06:03:39.000Z,"Crypto Firms Tap Capital Markets to Fuel Bitcoin Buying Spree","Key Takeaways: Crypto firms are raising billions to buy Bitcoin amid a historic price rally. Publicly listed companies holding Bitcoin have jumped to 113, with over 800,000 BTC. Major players like Trump Media, Blackstone, and DigiAsia are joining the treasury buying trend. Digital asset companies are flooding capital markets to raise funds for large-scale Bitcoin acquisitions, spurred by the cryptocurrency’s rally to a record $111,965 last week. The surge, up more than 50% from early April, has ignited a wave of listings and mergers as firms race to secure funding while investor appetite remains strong, according to a recent report by the Financial Times . This week, Trump Media & Technology Group confirmed plans to raise $2.5 billion to buy crypto, joining a growing list of firms mimicking MicroStrategy’s blueprint. 113 Publicly Listed Companies hold Bitcoin MicroStrategy, now renamed “Strategy,” holds 580,000 BTC and boasts a market capitalization exceeding $100 billion, more than the current value of its Bitcoin reserves. As of now, 113 publicly listed companies hold Bitcoin, up from 89 in April, with a combined stash of over 800,000 BTC worth approximately $88 billion. “Favourable market conditions are drawing capital,” Aaron Chan of Flow Traders told FT. “Investors are trying to get in early on the next Strategy.” That momentum is converging with this week’s annual Bitcoin conference in Las Vegas, a high-profile event drawing key players from finance, politics, and crypto. Among those capitalizing is Twenty One Capital , founded by Jack Mallers and backed by SoftBank, Tether, and Cantor Equity Partners. The venture expects to hold 42,000 BTC post-merger, valuing the firm at $14.4 billion. Meanwhile, Strive Asset Management, co-founded by former U.S. presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, aims to raise up to $1.5 billion to fund its own Bitcoin acquisitions. Bitcoin Treasuries Go Public Other firms are using mergers to fast-track listings. American Bitcoin, part-owned by Trump’s sons, is merging with Gryphon Mining, whose shares have surged 120%. KindlyMD, the acquisition partner of Nakamoto Holdings, has seen a 540% rise since their deal. Nakamoto CEO David Bailey said the goal is to “package Bitcoin” into forms accessible to institutional buyers. While the rally is creating momentum, analysts caution the copycat effect may hit limits. “The market needs to believe in the strategy,” said Patrick Bush of VanEck, highlighting the unique position of Strategy founder Michael Saylor. “His public visibility plays a key role.” Just recently, French crypto holding company Blockchain Group announced plans to purchase an additional $72 million worth of Bitcoin following a successful €63.3 million bond sale, as it expands its aggressive treasury strategy. On May 20, Blackstone, the world’s largest alternative asset manager, made its first move into crypto markets , purchasing shares in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Blackstone acquired 23,094 IBIT shares as of March 31, valued at approximately $1.08 million. Prior to that, shares of Indonesian fintech firm DigiAsia Corp surged by over 91% on May 19 , after the Nasdaq-listed company announced plans to raise $100 million to initiate Bitcoin purchases as part of a new treasury strategy.

The IMF said on May 27 that as part of the deal, El Salvador will need to fulfill its prior obligations around limiting further government involvement in Bitcoin ( BTC ), and it will have to cease its involvement in the Chivo wallet by the end of July. “On Bitcoin, efforts will continue to ensure that the total amount of Bitcoin held across all government-owned wallets remains unchanged,” the global lender said. The planned payout, subject to IMF executive board approval, is part of a larger $1.4 billion, 40-month loan deal struck in December, which saw El Salvador agree to confine its Bitcoin ambitions. On March 3, the IMF reiterated its stance that El Salvador should stop accumulating Bitcoin and not pursue other Bitcoin-related activities. Despite the IMF’s request, El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, has stated that his government will continue to acquire one BTC per day as part of the nation’s Bitcoin treasury strategy.

2025-05-28T06:00:52.000Z,"Ethereum May Be One Dip Away From Mass Losses—Data Warns","On-chain data shows a large portion of the Ethereum market cap was acquired near the current price, making ETH’s position potentially fragile. $123 Billion In Ethereum Market Cap Sits Close To Cost Basis As explained by the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode in a new post on X, the largest share of the Ethereum market cap is currently above the spot price by just 0 to 20%. Related Reading: How Does Bitcoin Investor Behavior Shape Trends? Glassnode Reveals The indicator of relevance here is the “Market Cap by Profit and Loss,” which tells us about how much of the ETH market cap has its cost basis sitting within what distance of the cryptocurrency’s price. Formally, the market cap is defined as the total circulating supply of the asset multiplied by the latest spot value. As such, the market cap of a particular group of tokens would be just their number multiplied by the price. The Market Cap by Profit and Loss refers to the last transaction price of these coins to determine whether the market cap held by them is in profit or loss right now. Naturally, the cost basis of the tokens being under the latest price suggests they are in profit, while the opposite case puts them in the loss category. Now, here is the chart for the indicator shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in its value for Ethereum over the past few months: As displayed in the above graph, the largest share of the Ethereum market cap is currently contained within the 0 to 20% cohort. This group includes coins that currently have their value between 0 and 20% above their cost basis. Naturally, even the tokens on the higher end of the range wouldn’t be in that big a profit at the moment. In total, about $123 billion of the ETH market cap, equivalent to almost 38%, falls under this category. Considering the delicate profit-loss balance that all this supply has, it’s possible that even an ordinary pullback could send a large number of tokens underwater. “Despite recent gains, ETH remains in a fragile position,” notes Glassnode. In some other news, Ethereum has witnessed a buying push from the whales during the past month, as analyst Ali Martinez has pointed out in an X post. “Whales” are defined as the investors carrying between 10,000 and 100,000 tokens of the cryptocurrency. From the chart, it’s apparent that the total Ethereum supply held by this cohort has registered a notable increase in the last few weeks.

2025-05-28T06:00:27.000Z,"US Government Pledges Not to Sell Bitcoin, Calls it ‘Golden Standard’ – A Pivotal Stance","BitcoinWorld US Government Pledges Not to Sell Bitcoin, Calls it ‘Golden Standard’ – A Pivotal Stance A significant statement from a key figure within the U.S. government has captured the attention of the cryptocurrency world. Bo Hines, the executive director of the U.S. President’s Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, recently offered a clear perspective on the government’s view and handling of its US government Bitcoin holdings. This declaration provides valuable insight into how digital assets are being perceived at high levels of power and what it could mean for future policy. Understanding the Statement on US Government Bitcoin Bo Hines, in comments reported by Bitcoin Magazine on X, didn’t mince words when discussing the leading cryptocurrency. His remarks focused on two core points that carry considerable weight: Bitcoin as the “Golden Standard”: Hines explicitly referred to Bitcoin as “the golden standard.” This is a powerful endorsement, likening Bitcoin to a traditional, universally recognized store of value. It suggests a growing recognition within certain government circles of Bitcoin’s unique properties and its potential role in the broader financial landscape. Commitment Not to Sell: Perhaps even more impactful was the statement regarding the government’s current holdings. According to the report, Hines emphasized that the U.S. government is “not gonna sell any Bitcoin that we possibly have.” This indicates a strategic intent to retain, rather than liquidate, seized or acquired Bitcoin assets. These statements, coming from an executive director of a council advising the President on digital assets, signal a potentially evolving perspective on cryptocurrency within the executive branch. While not formal policy, it reflects the thinking and recommendations being developed at a high level. Why Call Bitcoin the “Bitcoin Golden Standard”? The comparison of Bitcoin to the “golden standard” is not new within the crypto community, but hearing it from a government official is noteworthy. What characteristics of Bitcoin might lead to this assessment? Scarcity: Like gold, Bitcoin has a limited supply (capped at 21 million coins). This inherent scarcity is a fundamental driver of its value proposition as a store of value. Decentralization: Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network, free from control by any single government or financial institution. This independence can be seen as a strength, particularly in times of economic uncertainty or inflation. Durability and Immobility: Bitcoin, as a digital asset, is durable and easily transferable across borders without the physical limitations of commodities like gold. Recognition and Adoption: Bitcoin is the largest and most established cryptocurrency by market capitalization and network effect, giving it a level of recognition that other digital assets currently lack. This perspective suggests that the council sees Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but potentially as a long-term reserve asset or a foundational element in the digital economy, much like gold has been in the physical economy. Understanding Government Crypto Holdings It’s important to understand how the government crypto holdings discussed by Hines are typically acquired. The vast majority of Bitcoin held by the U.S. government comes from seizures related to criminal activities, such as those linked to dark web marketplaces, ransomware attacks, and fraud schemes. These holdings are managed by various agencies, including the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and others. Historically, the U.S. government has, on occasion, sold portions of its seized Bitcoin holdings through auctions. However, Hines’ statement suggests a potential shift or clarification in strategy – at least from the advisory council’s viewpoint – indicating a preference for holding rather than immediate liquidation of current and possibly future acquisitions. The specific phrase “not gonna sell any Bitcoin that we possibly have” could be interpreted as a forward-looking intent based on the council’s current advice. The size of the U.S. government’s Bitcoin holdings fluctuates as more assets are seized and, historically, some have been sold. However, these holdings are often substantial and represent a significant amount of Bitcoin outside of private hands. A commitment not to sell can remove a potential source of market supply pressure and signal confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. The Role of the Digital Assets Council The President’s Council of Advisers for Digital Assets plays a crucial role in informing the executive branch on complex issues related to cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and other digital assets. Established to provide expert advice, the council helps shape potential approaches to regulation, innovation, and the strategic implications of digital assets for the U.S. economy and national security. Statements from figures within this council offer a window into the evolving understanding and strategic thinking regarding digital assets at the highest levels. While they are advisory and do not constitute official, binding policy, they are influential in shaping the discourse and potential future direction of US Bitcoin policy and broader crypto regulation. The council likely considers a range of factors when formulating advice, including economic competitiveness, technological innovation, consumer protection, financial stability, and national security concerns related to digital assets. Hines’ comments suggest that the perceived long-term value and strategic importance of Bitcoin are key considerations within this advisory process. What Does This Mean for US Bitcoin Policy and the Market? Bo Hines’ statement, while not a formal policy announcement, carries weight due to his position. It suggests: Potential for a Bullish Signal: A high-level advisor viewing Bitcoin as a “golden standard” and advocating against selling government holdings can be interpreted by the market as a positive signal, suggesting increasing legitimacy and confidence from official corners. Influence on Future Policy: The council’s advice informs the President and relevant agencies. A perspective favoring retention over liquidation could influence how seized assets are handled in the future and potentially shape broader policy approaches to digital assets. Recognition of Bitcoin’s Unique Position: The distinction of calling Bitcoin specifically the “golden standard” sets it apart from other digital assets in this context, reinforcing its unique status in the crypto ecosystem from the council’s viewpoint. Reducing Potential Market Pressure: If the government commits to not selling its substantial holdings, it removes a potential source of large sell-offs that could impact market prices. However, it’s also important to consider the broader landscape. US Bitcoin policy is complex and involves multiple government bodies, including regulatory agencies like the SEC and CFTC, the Treasury Department, and Congress. Views and priorities can differ between these entities. Hines’ statement represents a perspective from an advisory body, not necessarily the unified, decided policy of the entire government. Actionable Insights for the Reader What can individuals interested in cryptocurrency take away from this? Stay Informed: Pay attention to statements from government officials and advisory bodies regarding digital assets. They provide clues about potential future regulatory and policy directions. Understand the Source: Differentiate between advisory opinions (like those from the council) and formal, binding regulations or laws passed by agencies or Congress. Consider Long-Term Trends: A high-level government advisor recognizing Bitcoin as a “golden standard” aligns with the long-term store-of-value narrative that many Bitcoin proponents hold. This kind of institutional acknowledgment can be a factor in assessing Bitcoin’s future trajectory. While regulatory clarity remains a key challenge for the crypto industry in the U.S., statements like these contribute to the ongoing dialogue and offer glimpses into how digital assets are being understood and potentially integrated into official thinking. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for US Bitcoin Policy Dialogue Bo Hines’ comments regarding the US government Bitcoin holdings and his characterization of Bitcoin as the “golden standard” represent a pivotal moment in the public discourse surrounding digital assets at the government level. The executive director of the President’s Council of Advisers for Digital Assets articulating a stance against selling government crypto holdings underscores a potential shift in how these assets are viewed and managed. While this is an advisory perspective and not formal US Bitcoin policy , it provides significant insight into the evolving strategic thinking within the executive branch regarding the value and role of Bitcoin and other digital assets. As the landscape continues to develop, such high-level acknowledgments of Bitcoin’s perceived intrinsic value and the intention to hold significant government crypto holdings will likely play a role in shaping future regulatory and economic strategies.

The payments will be facilitated via the Lightning Network. At the Bitcoin Conference 2025 this week in Las Vegas, Square is piloting real-time Bitcoin payments. Attendees can scan and spend crypto for T-shirts, hoodies, and hats at the BTC Inc. merchandise store. The Thursday launch marked the public debut of Block’s ambitious move, “ making Bitcoin everyday money .” Jack Dorsey wrote to his over 6 million followers on X that merchants can either choose to hold the Bitcoin, or auto-convert it to fiat in real-time. spend your bitcoin at @Square terminals. merchant can choose to hold the bitcoin, or auto-convert it to fiat in real-time. try it at bitcoin 2025 today. rolls out to more sellers this year. https://t.co/RWf6PV5Z2a — jack (@jack) May 27, 2025 Block Plans Phased Rollout by 2026 The planned roll-out will begin in the second half of 2025, an official release read. The feature is expected to expand to all eligible merchants by 2026, pending regulatory approvals. “Block has long been a champion of Bitcoin, focused on making it more accessible and usable in our everyday lives,” said Miles Suter, BTC product lead at Block. Suter helped oversee the setup of the new Square Bitcoin checkout, which he calls a “significant milestone” in making the crypto more accessible and usable. He joined Block in 2017, contributing to several of the company’s key milestones, including its Cash App’s Bitcoin integration. “Somebody’s got to be first,” he told CNBC, talking about the current Bitcoin payments feature. “And we feel like we have the right DNA to push things forward.” “We believe in an open, decentralized, fair, fast, and low-cost money system for everyone, and that’s exactly what we want to bring to Square sellers.” In April, former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey publicly urged Signal Messenger to integrate Bitcoin for peer-to-peer (P2P) payments. Dorsey has long maintained that Bitcoin’s utility in daily transactions is essential for its long-term success. Expanding the Bitcoin Ecosystem Apart from payments on Square, Block is expanding its Bitcoin ecosystem with products such as Cash App’s bitcoin buy, sell, and transfer features. Additionally, Block is expanding global access to Bitcoin through Bitkey, a self-custody BTC wallet, with the launch of new privacy and security features starting this month. Besides, Block is building Proto, its suite of bitcoin mining products and services, “to decentralize mining,” the release noted. Meanwhile, following the Bitcoin payments roll-out, Block Inc. shares climbed 5.81% , reaching an intraday high of $62.66, before settling at $62.17 on May 27.

2025-05-28T05:58:34.000Z,"Bitcoin Traders Eye New Highs by End of Summer; Ether Rises 3% on Treasury Optimism","Bitcoin BTC held steady near $109,000 early Wednesday as traders bet on fresh highs in the coming months, with ether ETH rising over 3% after renewed confidence in Ethereum's long-term strategy and broader institutional activity. U.S. equities surged following the Memorial Day weekend, led by a 2% gain in the Nasdaq, as investors shrugged off labor market concerns and drew optimism from softening trade tensions. The rebound, aided by stabilizing Treasury yields and easing shipping disruptions between China and the U.S., has rekindled risk appetite across asset classes. “Institutional investors are increasingly reallocating into crypto after volatility shook traditional safe havens,” said Kay Lu, CEO of HashKey Eco Labs. “Ethereum’s new treasury initiative—mirroring MicroStrategy’s BTC approach—shows that crypto is becoming a long-term reserve asset for the web3 ecosystem.” Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin and development lab ConsenSys unveiled a $425 million ETH-based treasury reserve plan at publicly traded SharpLink, a move likened to Bitcoin-centric corporate strategies. The company is raising roughly $425 million through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) offering. The proceeds will be used to buy ether, which will then serve as the primary treasury reserve asset. The offering is expected to close on May 29th, according to the release. Lubin will become chairman of the board of directors upon the closing. Meanwhile, bitcoin exchange-traded funds saw over $385 million in fresh inflows, signaling continued institutional demand. Still, traders remain cautious ahead of the high-profile Bitcoin Conference, which kicks off in Las Vegas this week. Key speakers include JD Vance, Michael Saylor, and members of the Trump family, whose past appearances have stirred sharp market reactions. “Front-end volatility remains elevated with BTC trading in a tight $107K to $110K range,” Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a market broadcast. “Last year’s Trump keynote in Nashville caused a spike in 1-day implied vol above 90, followed by a 30% BTC drop. That memory is still informing positioning.” QCP added that perpetual futures open interest has eased, funding rates have normalized, and some prominent retail traders, including James Wynn, appear to be reducing exposure. The defensive posturing suggests that, while new highs are expected this summer, traders are bracing for short-term volatility around political and macro headlines. Still, analysts remain broadly bullish. “The structure underneath remains strong,” said Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Positive macro headwinds and better underlying structure paint an optimistic outlook with traders expecting prices to grind towards new highs by the summer,” Fan ended.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/28/bitcoin-traders-eye-new-highs-by-end-of-summer-ether-rises-3-on-treasury-optimism,"BTC|ETH|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|market analysis|News",cryptocompare
2025-05-28T05:54:56.000Z,"IMF Vows to Rein In El Salvador’s Bitcoin Stash Under Loan Conditions","El Salvador is once again facing international scrutiny for its continued embrace of Bitcoin. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund said it had reached a staff-level agreement with the Salvadoran government as part of the first review of a $1.4b extended loan program. While praising the country’s progress on fiscal reforms and macroeconomic stability, the IMF said it would work to “ensure” that the total amount of Bitcoin held by the government remains unchanged. The announcement, which follows months of negotiations, reflects a delicate balancing act between supporting El Salvador’s economic ambitions and placing limits on its headline-grabbing Bitcoin policy. The IMF noted that while risks from the country’s crypto adoption have diminished, maintaining stability requires tighter controls. As part of the terms, El Salvador also committed to withdrawing public sector involvement in the Chivo wallet, its state-run Bitcoin app, by the end of July. Despite IMF Oversight, El Salvador’s Bitcoin Wallet Keeps Growing The update follows comments from economy minister Maria Luisa Hayem, who reiterated in April that Bitcoin remains a government priority. Speaking at the Web Summit in Rio de Janeiro, she confirmed that the country continues to accumulate Bitcoin despite the IMF program’s guidelines. Since striking the deal in Dec. 2024 , El Salvador has added at least 20 Bitcoin to its treasury. As of May 2025, the country holds around 6,190 BTC , worth an estimated $675m with last BTC purchase made on 28 May. With Bitcoin prices soaring this year, the nation sits on unrealized gains of over $350m, according to government data. IMF Backs Limited Crypto Exposure as El Salvador Pledges Economic Reforms El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, a move that drew sharp criticism from multilateral lenders including the IMF. Talks over financial support stalled for years as the fund urged the country to reconsider its crypto policy. But the recent agreement signals a more pragmatic tone, with the IMF allowing limited crypto exposure while insisting on broader economic discipline. To secure the next $120m tranche of funding, the Salvadoran government has agreed to strengthen fiscal consolidation, raise bank liquidity requirements and implement civil service and pension reforms. The IMF said the deal remains subject to executive board approval and hinges on the country meeting prior agreed actions. While the Bitcoin cap may frustrate crypto advocates, the Salvadoran administration appears determined to continue its digital asset experiment within the limits of international oversight.

2025-05-28T05:50:40.000Z,"Ethereum OI Explodes to Record Highs After SharpLink’s Game-Changing Crypto Treasury Move","BitcoinWorld Ethereum OI Explodes to Record Highs After SharpLink’s Game-Changing Crypto Treasury Move Wow, what a week it’s been for the Ethereum market! We’ve seen a truly significant move recently, with ETH Open Interest soaring to an all-time record high. This wasn’t just random market noise; it followed a pretty interesting announcement from a company you might not typically expect to see making crypto headlines: SharpLink Gaming . Wait, SharpLink Gaming is Buying ETH? What’s the Big Deal? For those unfamiliar, SharpLink Gaming is a Nasdaq-listed online technology company. While their primary focus is gaming, they recently made a strategic move that caught the attention of the crypto world: they announced the establishment of a corporate Crypto Treasury , specifically including Ethereum (ETH) as part of their balance sheet. Why is this significant? It signals a growing trend of publicly traded companies looking to allocate a portion of their corporate funds into digital assets. While MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin treasury has been a long-standing example, SharpLink’s decision to include ETH highlights the increasing confidence in Ethereum’s role and future within the digital economy. It’s another data point suggesting institutional adoption is expanding beyond just Bitcoin. How Did This News Cause ETH Open Interest to Skyrocket? Let’s break down what Open Interest (OI) means in the context of futures markets. OI represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures or options, that have not been settled. It’s a key metric traders and analysts watch because it can indicate the level of market activity, liquidity, and the potential strength behind a price trend. Following SharpLink’s announcement, the ETH Open Interest saw a dramatic surge. According to reports, including analysis shared by Cointelegraph citing CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn, Ethereum futures market activity picked up considerably. The most striking data point? OI increased by a staggering $3.5 billion in a single day, pushing the total to a record $36.1 billion! The connection here is clear: a corporate treasury announcement, especially from a publicly traded company, is often interpreted by the market as a bullish signal. Traders and institutions, anticipating potential positive price movement fueled by this adoption, tend to open new long positions in ETH Futures contracts. This influx of new positions directly contributes to the rise in Open Interest. Why Are Corporate Crypto Treasury Announcements So Impactful? The decision by companies like SharpLink Gaming to establish a Crypto Treasury and hold assets like Ethereum sends several powerful signals to the market: Validation: It validates cryptocurrencies as legitimate assets suitable for corporate balance sheets, not just speculative tools for individuals. Demand: It represents real-world demand for the underlying asset, potentially removing supply from exchanges and contributing to price stability or appreciation. Confidence: It shows increasing confidence from traditional businesses in the long-term value proposition and infrastructure of blockchain networks like Ethereum . Trend Setting: These early adopters can pave the way for more companies to follow suit, potentially creating a virtuous cycle of adoption and price support. SharpLink’s move is particularly interesting as they chose to include ETH, highlighting the growing recognition of Ethereum’s ecosystem, its role in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and its upcoming technical advancements. What Does This Record ETH Futures Activity Tell Us? A record high in ETH Open Interest is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it reflects significant market participation and, likely, strong bullish sentiment driving the opening of new long positions in ETH Futures . More capital is flowing into the market, indicating conviction among participants. However, high OI, especially when fueled by rapid surges, can also indicate increased leverage in the system. This is where the insights from analysts like CryptoQuant’s Maartunn become crucial. Maartunn outlined that since April 28, there have been 10 leverage-driven Ethereum pump signals. While one triggered a short squeeze (forcing short sellers to buy back at higher prices), a significant eight of them actually led to a subsequent pullback. This suggests that while corporate news can trigger initial bullish enthusiasm and increase OI, the market structure, particularly the amount of leverage being used, makes Ethereum susceptible to volatility and potential corrections. A market heavily reliant on leverage can experience rapid price drops if positions are liquidated in masse during a downturn. Navigating the Current Ethereum Market: Opportunities and Risks The current landscape presents both exciting opportunities and significant risks for those involved with Ethereum : Opportunities: The SharpLink announcement and the subsequent OI surge could be indicative of broader institutional interest that could provide long-term support for ETH ‘s price. Increased market activity often leads to more trading opportunities for those who can effectively navigate volatility. Growing corporate adoption adds fundamental strength to the Ethereum ecosystem. Risks: The high level of ETH Open Interest , particularly with the noted prevalence of leverage signals leading to pullbacks, suggests the market could be fragile. A sharp reversal in sentiment or a cascade of liquidations could lead to a rapid and significant price correction. The market’s reaction might be overly reliant on bullish news, making it vulnerable to disappointment or negative external factors. Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors: Monitor Leverage Metrics: Pay attention to funding rates on futures exchanges, which can indicate excessive leverage. Understand Liquidation Risks: Be aware that large OI can mean significant liquidation levels exist, which could act as magnets for price movements. Implement Risk Management: Use stop-losses and manage position sizes carefully, especially when volatility is high. Look Beyond the Hype: While corporate adoption is bullish long-term, short-term market movements driven by leverage can be unpredictable. Consider the fundamental value alongside market sentiment. A Compelling Summary: What Does It All Mean? The recent surge in ETH Open Interest to a record $36.1 billion, significantly boosted by news of SharpLink Gaming establishing a corporate Crypto Treasury with Ethereum , underscores the increasing institutional interest in the digital asset space. This development is a positive signal for Ethereum ‘s adoption trajectory and validates its growing importance. However, the context provided by market analysts regarding the prevalence of leverage-driven signals leading to pullbacks adds a layer of caution. While high OI can indicate bullish conviction, it also highlights the potential for increased volatility and liquidation risks within the ETH Futures market. Market participants should celebrate the adoption news but remain vigilant and employ sound risk management strategies in this dynamic environment.

When asked where he saw Bitcoin in two to five years, Trump Jr. said , “I alluded to it earlier, but we’re going to the moon, guys, its gonna be awesome. Stay in, stay strong.” “We’re in it all these different ways, whether its Truth Social, American Bitcoin on the mining side, World Liberty Financial on the DeFi platform … we’re true believers.” DON TRUMP JR. SAYS “WE’RE SERIOUSLY LONG #BITCOIN ” “THAT’S WHY WE CREATED $2.4 BILLION BITCOIN TREASURY” “TO THE MOON AS THEY SAY” pic.twitter.com/aEmPSjukBx — The Bitcoin Conference (@TheBitcoinConf) May 28, 2025 $2.5B Bitcoin Treasury Earlier in the interview, Trump Jr. confirmed, “we’re seriously long on crypto, seriously long on Bitcoin,” adding that the Trump media group TMGT was “literally creating a Bitcoin treasury to the tune of 2.5 billion dollars,” which was met with huge applause. “There’s not a lot of people who have done something that big or shown that much commitment,” he added. Trump said that assets would be accumulated through partner ventures such as American Bitcoin in partnership with Hut 8, and other crypto through the WLF DeFi platform, though he didn’t mention specific tokens. “In my opinion, DeFi is going to change so many aspects of the financial system and create the efficiencies that have been lacking [in traditional finance].” Speaking on banks and traditional finance, Trump Jr. said that they were “reluctant adapters” because they view a lot of these new technologies as a threat. “Every day when I see someone else adapting this or taking on a little bit [of Bitcoin], I think we’re at the point when those floodgates are going to open.” Once you create the regulatory framework to keep this activity in America and not ship the “new financial sector of America” to other places, it is critically important, he concluded. Trump Supports $1B Bitcoin Reserve Donald Trump Jr. wasn’t the only one uber bullish on Bitcoin and crypto. Also speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, Senator Cynthia Lummis said she is bringing the Bitcoin Act to the “attention of the American people and the world,” adding, “President Trump supports the bill.” The legislation, reintroduced in March , directs the US government to acquire 1 million BTC over five years for a strategic reserve.

Convertible notes at 35% premium highlight TMTG’s aggressive crypto capital strategy. Regulatory scrutiny intensifies amid Trump-linked ETFs and expanding crypto ventures. Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), the parent company of Truth Social, is making a bold entry into the cryptocurrency market. The company has announced a $2.5 billion strategy to establish a Bitcoin treasury reserve. This plan signals a major strategic shift for the media company as it looks to diversify its operations beyond social media and streaming services. Given that U.S. President Donald Trump is closely linked with the brand, this initiative brings a decidedly high-profile element to TMTG’s financial ambitions. The company plans to raise the capital through two primary channels. It will sell $1.5 billion in new stock based on its most recent closing price. Additionally, it will issue $1 billion in convertible notes at a 35% premium. Once these funds are secured, they will be allocated to purchasing Bitcoin (BTC).

2025-05-28T05:35:59.000Z,"Bitcoin Uptrend at Risk Ahead of Nvidia Earnings, Fed Minutes; XRP Holds Key Support Amid XRPFi Narrative","Bitcoin's BTC upward trend continued to show signs of weakness early Wednesday, even as Wall Street tech stocks surged overnight in anticipation of upbeat earnings from AI giant Nvidia (NVDA). The leading cryptocurrency by market value traded near $108,900 at press time, teasing a downside break of a trendline characterizing the uptrend from early April lows, according to data source Coingecko. Bullish trendlines indicate areas of strong demand, thus a move below one is generally seen as a sign of a potential reversal and a possible start of a downward move. Prices have not been able to make significant gains this week despite a flurry of positive news, including stablecoin issuer Circle's plans to file for an IPO and Trump Media's plans to raise $2.5 billion to purchase bitcoin. On-chain activity suggests that large investors have recently begun distributing coins, contributing to the market's selling pressure. \""As of May 26, the >10K BTC cohort has pivoted to net distribution (~0.3), signaling a notable shift in positioning among the largest holders,\"" Glassnode said on X. The firm, however, added that overall, the market remains in an accumulation mode. Focus on Fed minutes and NVDA earnings Later Wednesday, the spotlight will be on minutes of the Federal Reserve's May meeting, which will offer detailed insights into the committee’s stance on monetary policy and potential clues about future interest rate decisions. The central bank left the benchmark interest rate unchanged early this month, with Chairman Jerome Powell pointing squarely to President Donald Trump's tariff war as a source of inflation and uncertainty. Powell also “stagflation” aloud. The minutes are likely to reiterate the same, although the recent tariff delay by Trump means the market may not pay much attention to hawkish messaging. Meanwhile, AI major Nvidia's earnings announcement could move markets, particularly digital assets, given the historical positive correlation between BTC and NVDA. The firm is expected to report strong earnings and revenue growth, driving benefits from investments in AI infrastructure. The focus will be on the company's outlook on AI demand and China amid restrictions on Chip exports to China.

2025-05-28T05:35:44.000Z,"Bitcoin (BTC) Nears Euphoria Zone With 99% UTXOs in Profit","Bitcoin’s price rallied 50% from the April lows, hitting an all-time high of approximately $112,000 on May 23 amid renewed market momentum. On the backdrop, a key Bitcoin metric has quietly reached a level that has historically preceded major market turning points. While the data suggests widespread unrealized gains among holders, analysts urge restraint. UTXO Profitability Reaches Critical Level According to CryptoQuant’s latest analysis , 99% of Bitcoin’s Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) are currently in profit. This has historically proven to be a critical threshold, previously linked to market euphoria. UTXOs, which represent unspent BTC from previous transactions, are a key metric for gauging unrealized profits across the network. When nearly all holders are sitting on gains, it often signals heightened bullish sentiment, a condition that can precede either sustained rallies or sharp corrections. While the 99% mark is typically seen as a sign of strength, CryptoQuant stated that the current macroeconomic uncertainty , particularly around the Trump administration’s potential policy direction, makes it difficult to conclude that true market euphoria has arrived. As such, investors appear hesitant to embrace risk fully. Hence, the report cautioned that if this metric begins to decline, it could indicate that unrealized profits are shrinking. That scenario could trigger increased profit-taking among earlier investors and force latecomers – those who bought near recent highs – to sell at a loss, potentially accelerating downside momentum. Short-Term Buyer Fatigue Glassnode also noted a concerning trend and flagged “signs of cooling momentum.” In its recent update , the platform observed that the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) fell by 25.1%, and net spot demand declined, suggesting potential short-term buyer fatigue. In derivatives markets, open interest and funding rates climbed, which indicated a growing speculative activity. Despite this, Glassnode explained that the Perpetual Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) trending lower points to stronger sell-side pressure and more caution among traders. Options data revealed a mixed picture: while the 25-Delta Skew remained stable, rising open interest and a widening volatility spread may reflect hedging or profit-taking. Liquidity conditions improved, supported by elevated unrealized profits and continued activity from short-term holders. Meanwhile, a slight uptick in the short-to-long-term holder (STH/LTH) supply ratio, coupled with a small dip in the Realized Profit-to-Loss ratio, signaled tempered enthusiasm over the weekend. On-chain fundamentals showed a mild decrease in active addresses, which demonstrated a slowdown in user activity following a period of intense engagement.

2025-05-28T05:31:50.000Z,"Trump Supports Plan for US to Buy One Million Bitcoin","Trump also reportedly established a White House team dedicated to digital asset legislation, aiming for a structured rollout that begins with stablecoin regulation and expands into broader market reform. The budget-neutral plan will be funded through existing Federal Reserve and Treasury resources. Trump Media also confirmed a $2.5 billion capital raise to buy Bitcoin, despite initial denials from the company which slammed a report from the Financial Times. Additionally, Adam Back recently spoke about his long-term bullish thesis, and warned that selling Bitcoin is similar to gambling. Institutional demand continues to rise, which suggests that Bitcoin may increasingly become a core financial reserve for both governments and corporations. Bitcoin Act Gains Momentum At the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Senator Cynthia Lummis announced that President Donald Trump is officially backing the BITCOIN Act. This is a legislative proposal to have the US government acquire one million Bitcoin over the next five years. According to Lummis, Trump not only supports the bill but has also established a team in the White House to actively work on comprehensive digital asset legislation. The acquisitions outlined in the bill will be funded using existing resources from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to ensure that there is no additional tax burden on American citizens. This “budget-neutral” approach was previously pointed out by the Trump administration as a cornerstone of their digital asset strategy. Senator Lummis talked about the administration’s commitment to a structured rollout of digital asset legislation, beginning with stablecoins, followed by broader market structure reforms and the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve. She said that the stablecoin bill has already passed through the Senate Banking Committee and is likely to be brought to the Senate floor for a vote shortly after the current congressional recess ends. Lummis also mentioned the bipartisan cooperation involved in advancing the bill, as well as the extensive negotiations with minority party lawmakers to ensure cross-party support. The momentum behind stablecoin legislation was further reinforced by David Sacks, Trump’s top crypto adviser, who recently stated that the GENIUS Act is poised to pass the Senate with bipartisan backing. The bill cleared a key procedural vote on May 19,and is viewed as the most comprehensive attempt yet to regulate dollar-pegged stablecoins at the federal level. (Source: US Senate ) Industry experts believe regulation like this could help boost the global role of the US dollar by leveraging blockchain-based assets. Currently, stablecoins such as Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC make up over 85% of the $250 billion stablecoin market. Trump Media Confirms $2.5B Bitcoin Bet Trump’s support of crypto also became evident after Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), the parent company of Truth Social and partially owned by President Donald Trump, confirmed a $2.5 billion capital raise to buy Bitcoin. In a May 27 announcement , TMTG shared details about the funding structure, which includes a $1.5 billion stock sale and $1 billion in convertible senior secured bonds with a 0% coupon. The transaction is expected to close by May 29. Announcement from Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes explained that the decision reflects the company’s belief in Bitcoin as a powerful symbol of financial freedom. Nunes added that holding Bitcoin will help the company guard against what he described as harassment and discrimination by financial institutions. The confirmation came a day after a Financial Times report suggested the deal was in motion, which TMTG initially dismissed with sharp criticism of the publication and its sources. Despite the strategic move into digital assets, TMTG’s stock dropped more than 12% after the announcement was made, which caused it to trade at approximately $23.60 at the time of writing. The investment is part of a trend of corporations adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset. In May alone, several companies boosted their Bitcoin holdings. Michael Saylor’s Strategy acquired 4,020 BTC on May 26. Similarly, tech firm Semler Scientific disclosed a purchase of 455 BTC valued at over $50 million, while Japanese investment firm MetaPlanet acquired 1,004 BTC earlier in the month. Market analyst Jesse Myers recently pointed out the growing pace of institutional accumulation, and predicted that major entities could control half of all Bitcoin by 2045 if current trends continue. Myers argued that this surge in adoption stems from a wider exodus out of fiat-based financial instruments, as capital increasingly flows into hard assets like Bitcoin and gold. Adam Back Says Selling Bitcoin Is a Losing Bet The fact that Trump seems intent on holding on to the US government’s Bitcoin as well Trump Media’s stockpile may be a good thing. Adam Back, the CEO of Blockstream and one of Bitcoin’s earliest pioneers, believes that selling Bitcoin is similar to “playing in a really bad house-rate casino.” In a recent interview with Bitcoin financial services firm Unchained, Back explained that the odds are heavily skewed against those trying to time the market. His insights stem from his early experience in the Bitcoin space, when the asset’s price was climbing exponentially despite extreme volatility. He believes that trying to sell during dips, hoping for a better re-entry, is generally a losing game because the long-term trajectory consistently trended upwards. Back’s comments shed some light on a key tension for Bitcoin investors: navigating the asset’s notorious volatility while still staying focused on the larger exponential trend. Bitcoin has undergone several severe corrections throughout its history, and often fell more than 80% during bear markets. Yet, those who held on have seen impressive gains. Over the past decade, Bitcoin delivered a staggering total return of more than 39,000%, which lends some credibility to Back’s point about the risk of mistiming exits. Average Bitcoin returns (Source: Curvo ) Despite concerns about diminishing returns as Bitcoin matures, Back argued that the current cycle could defy that theory. He pointed to growing interest from both corporations and governments as potential drivers of sustained upward momentum. Firms like Strategy continue to accumulate Bitcoin, sometimes through innovative financial instruments like convertible notes. This approach offers both direct and indirect exposure to the asset. Institutional and sovereign entities are also making strategic moves. Abu Dhabi, for example, made headlines with a $408.5 million investment in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF. Meanwhile, the political landscape is shifting in favor of Bitcoin as well. President Donald Trump recently signed an executive order to establish a federal Bitcoin reserve, and New Hampshire and Texas have taken similar steps at the state level. Back believes these kinds of developments point toward broader adoption and potentially another phase of exponential growth, albeit still marked by periods of high volatility.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9334/trump-supports-plan-for-us-to-buy-one-million-bitcoin,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

It wants to link a central‐bank deposit token to public blockchain networks. This push could reshape how money moves in South Korea and beyond. Public Blockchain Connectivity According to Deputy Governor Lee Jong-ryeol, the Bank of Korea is “considering a plan to link” its deposit tokens with public blockchain systems . He calls these tokens a “type of stablecoin,” backed by the central bank’s digital currency framework. Lee made these remarks at the Blockchain Leaders Club event on Tuesday. He sees a chance for banks, businesses, and even individuals to use a state-issued token on networks like Ethereum or others. The Bank of Korea plans to integrate deposit tokens on public #blockchain networks. Deputy Governor Lee Jong-ryeol outlined the bank’s vision at the ‘Blockchain Leaders Club’ event on Tuesday. pic.twitter.com/z2fnkSeGMx — Sachi (@sachi_gkp) May 27, 2025 Stablecoin Outflows Spark Concern Based on reports, stablecoins accounted for about 47% of South Korea’s crypto outflows in Q1. That equals nearly 27 trillion won (USD $19.1 billion). Traders in Seoul often use USDT and USDC because they hold steady in value. Lee warned that relying on foreign stablecoins could hurt the won’s role in the global market. He said it could threaten monetary sovereignty, spur financial instability, and even help money laundering. Rising Global Stablecoin Market Stablecoins are flourishing on the global scene. Their entire market worth surpassed $230 billion in March 2025. The total stablecoin market value as of this writing is a little over $247 billion , up $3.537 billion in the previous week. Those figures show how fast private issuers are growing. Lee noted that South Korea must act before foreign coins dominate local trading. Crypto Industry And Political Push Major exchanges like Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit were at Tuesday’s event alongside regulators. Their presence underlines how crypto firms want a say in rules. Meanwhile, opposition leader Lee Jae-myung has promised a won-backed stablecoin if he wins the presidency. He argues it could cut the 56.8 trillion won ($40.8 billion) crypto outflow and make local trading easier. Other lawmakers, such as Min Byoung-dug of the Democratic Party, say South Korea must “take the lead in institutionalizing stablecoins” before US-pegged tokens take over. Next Steps For Digital Won Additional tests are planned by the Bank of Korea this year. It will look at how to keep tokens secure, maintain the privacy of users and comply with anti-money laundering regulations. If those pilots go well, a business pilot could arrive by 2026. That would mean a huge shift in how money works in South Korea, possibly leading other countries to follow suit.

2025-05-28T05:20:06.000Z,"Urgent: US Bitcoin Legislation Needed for Strategic Reserve Expansion, Says VanEck Executive","BitcoinWorld Urgent: US Bitcoin Legislation Needed for Strategic Reserve Expansion, Says VanEck Executive Imagine a world where the United States holds a significant strategic reserve of Bitcoin, similar to its petroleum reserves. Sounds ambitious, right? Well, according to Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets at major U.S. asset management firm VanEck, this isn’t just a pipe dream, but a crucial step that requires specific US Bitcoin legislation to become a reality. Why a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve ? Unpacking the Concept The idea of a national Bitcoin strategic reserve is gaining traction in certain circles. At its core, it envisions the U.S. government accumulating and holding a substantial amount of Bitcoin. Why would the U.S. want to do this? National Security: In an increasingly digital and interconnected world, controlling a non-sovereign, globally recognized asset like Bitcoin could offer strategic advantages, potentially bypassing traditional financial systems or sanctions in critical situations. Economic Stability: Some proponents argue it could serve as a hedge against inflation or currency devaluation, acting as a modern store of value alongside traditional assets like gold. Geopolitical Influence: A large U.S. holding could influence the global Bitcoin market and solidify the nation’s position in the future digital economy. This isn’t just theoretical talk; it’s a concept being discussed at high levels, including conferences like Bitcoin 2025 where Matthew Sigel shared his insights. VanEck Bitcoin Strategy: Sigel’s Legislative Proposal Speaking at the recent Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Matthew Sigel laid out a clear pathway he believes is the most effective for the U.S. to build this reserve: targeted amendments to congressional budget legislation. Forget complex new crypto bills for a moment; Sigel suggests leveraging existing legislative processes to bake incentives directly into the system. His proposal centers on two key mechanisms: Tax Deductions for Methane Utilization: Sigel highlighted the environmental benefits and cost savings associated with Bitcoin mining operations that capture and utilize wasted methane gas. By offering specific tax deductions or incentives for miners engaging in this practice, the government could encourage environmentally friendlier mining while also potentially creating a pathway to acquire Bitcoin. Mandatory Bitcoin Allocation: A portion of the Bitcoin mined by these incentivized operations could be required to be provided directly to the federal government. This would create a direct, albeit potentially gradual, method for the government to accumulate Bitcoin for its reserve. This approach, as outlined by the VanEck Bitcoin expert, aims to align economic incentives for the private sector (miners) with the strategic goal of the government (building a reserve), making the expansion process more organic and less reliant on direct market purchases. The Crucial Role of US Bitcoin Legislation Sigel’s emphasis on legislation is critical. While executive orders can provide some direction, fundamental changes like establishing a strategic reserve and creating tax incentives typically require congressional action. Amending budget legislation is a powerful tool because it directly impacts financial flows and can mandate specific activities or allocate funds (or assets, in this case). Passing specific US Bitcoin legislation is often a slow and complex process, fraught with political debate. Sigel’s suggestion to use budget amendments implies a strategy of attaching crypto-related provisions to broader, must-pass spending bills, potentially streamlining the legislative path. Navigating the Political Minefield: Challenges to Crypto Policy US Building a Bitcoin strategic reserve through legislation isn’t without its hurdles. As Matthew Sigel pointed out, the current political climate around cryptocurrency in the U.S. is polarized. Sigel specifically mentioned the executive order (EO) issued by former U.S. President Donald Trump, noting that such actions, even if intended to explore crypto’s potential, often face significant legal challenges. He highlighted prominent anti-crypto politicians, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, as likely sources of opposition and potential lawsuits against government initiatives perceived as being too favorable to the crypto industry. Here are some political challenges facing crypto policy US : Regulatory Uncertainty: Different government agencies (SEC, CFTC, Treasury) have varying views and approaches to regulating crypto, creating confusion and making unified legislative action difficult. Political Opposition: A vocal group of politicians remains skeptical or outright hostile towards cryptocurrency, citing concerns about illicit finance, consumer protection, and environmental impact (though Sigel’s proposal attempts to address the latter). Lack of Education: Many policymakers still lack a deep understanding of Bitcoin and blockchain technology, leading to hesitant or misinformed legislative attempts. Lobbying Efforts: Both pro- and anti-crypto lobbying groups are actively trying to influence legislation, adding another layer of complexity. Any legislative effort to establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve would need to navigate these political crosscurrents, addressing concerns while building bipartisan support, a significant challenge in today’s political environment. Benefits and Challenges: A Closer Look Let’s break down the potential upsides and downsides of establishing a U.S. Bitcoin strategic reserve as proposed by Matthew Sigel : Potential Benefits Potential Challenges Enhances national security and geopolitical standing. Significant political opposition and potential lawsuits. Provides a potential hedge against economic instability. Implementation complexity (how to store, secure, manage?). Encourages environmentally friendly mining practices via incentives. Market impact of government accumulation or potential selling. Diversifies national assets beyond traditional reserves. Public perception and understanding. Stimulates domestic mining industry growth. Defining the purpose and use-cases of the reserve. While the benefits, particularly from a strategic and economic perspective, are compelling for proponents like VanEck Bitcoin ‘s Sigel, the practical and political hurdles remain substantial. The debate around crypto policy US is far from settled. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Policy US ? Matthew Sigel’s comments underscore a growing reality: cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin, is increasingly being viewed through a strategic national lens, not just as a speculative asset class. Discussions about integrating Bitcoin into national strategy, whether through reserves, regulatory frameworks, or fostering domestic industry (like mining), are becoming more prominent. His focus on budget legislation suggests that proponents of integrating Bitcoin into U.S. strategy are looking for pragmatic legislative avenues, potentially bypassing the gridlock often seen with standalone crypto bills. This approach could signal a shift in strategy for crypto advocates in Washington. For investors, miners, and the broader crypto community, these discussions highlight the potential for significant government involvement in the Bitcoin ecosystem, which could have long-term implications for market structure, adoption, and innovation within the U.S. Conclusion: A Bold Vision Requiring Political Will Matthew Sigel’s proposal for expanding a U.S. Bitcoin strategic reserve through targeted budget legislation is a bold and pragmatic vision. By linking incentives for environmentally conscious mining with the goal of government accumulation, the plan offers a potential path to build national Bitcoin holdings organically. However, realizing this vision hinges entirely on navigating the complex and often contentious landscape of crypto policy US . Overcoming political opposition, addressing regulatory concerns, and building consensus in Congress will be the ultimate test for whether the U.S. decides to pursue a national Bitcoin strategic reserve in a meaningful way. The conversation has started, driven by key figures like Sigel from firms like VanEck Bitcoin , but the legislative journey is just beginning.

2025-05-28T05:10:43.000Z,"CFTC’s Goldsmith Romero says commissioner exodus ‘not a great situation’","Outgoing US Commodity Futures Trading Commission commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero says the exodus of the agency’s top brass is “not a great situation” for crypto regulations. The CFTC could be headed by just one commissioner once the other four depart later this year, which Goldsmith Romero said in a May 27 interview at the Brookings Institution will make creating regulations harder because it leaves a less diverse pool of opinions. “I think it’s not a great situation if you have one person who’s determining what the rules should be; you lose the benefit of this back-and-forth, this push-and-pull as to what’s the right thing to do,” she said. “I’ve always wanted to hear from my fellow commissioners about what makes sense to them, and there are many things that they’ve convinced me of and many things that I’ve convinced them of, so I think it does a disservice to regulation.” Christy Goldsmith Romero said that four CFTC commissioners departing is not ideal because it leaves a less diverse pool of opinions. Source: YouTube Goldsmith Romero’s last day will be May 31 , leaving Commissioner Kristin Johnson as the CFTC’s sole Democrat, who has also announced plans to depart the agency before 2026. Republican Commissioner Summer Mersinger is also leaving on May 30 to join the crypto advocacy organization the Blockchain Association as CEO and Republican acting CFTC Chair Caroline Pham said on May 15 that she plans to move “to the private sector” if Brian Quintenz were to be confirmed head of the agency. If Quintenz is confirmed, and Pham follows through on leaving, it would leave him solely in charge of the agency. Five commissioners are supposed to make up the CFTC, and no more than three can be from the same political party. Goldsmith Romero said that during her tenure, all the commissioners had different perspectives and experiences that, when brought together, were “really helpful.” “So what happens if the CFTC gets down to one and gets new authority for crypto? It’s going to be really, really hard; you’re not going to have the same push and pull,” she said. The Trump administration has floated the idea of handing the reins of crypto regulation to the CFTC in the past. Congressional Republicans have also been drafting bills to give the CFTC greater oversight over the industry, Retail customer Definition should be CFTC priority In the future, Goldsmith Romero thinks the CFTC should work on defining a retail customer to ensure the influx of fresh investments in “crypto and some other products” has a similar retail customer protection regime to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Related: Crypto perp futures coming ‘very soon,’ says CFTC’s Mersinger “I came from the SEC with an investor protection regime, you want people to know their rights and risk if they take a risk and they lose that’s on them,” she said. “But you want to have some basic things like exchanges that are registered that have some basic requirements and have to follow the law and this is, I think, the main thing that needs to happen.” Goldsmith Romero said other “extremely basic” rules could include a ban against co-mingling a company’s assets with customer funds, and brokers, exchanges and clearing houses being required to register with the SEC, the CFTC or in some cases, both.

2025-05-28T05:02:23.000Z,"Amidst Growing Concerns about a Potential Price Peak, Expert Maintains Bitcoin is Still not Overheated","Bitcoin bulls appear to be wide awake and active this week, successfully launching the leading cryptocurrency to a new all-time high of $111,970. Despite Bitcoin’s impressive performance, a market analyst asserts that the bull cycle is still ongoing and that the asset is far from being “overheated.” Dan Crypto, a popular cryptocurrency analyst with over 600,000 followers on X, shared his outlook on the state of the Bitcoin market. According to the analyst, the funding rate, a key indicator designed to display market overheating, shows that although long bets have increased, it is incomparable to previous market tops. “By examining the proportion of bitcoins traded within 1 week to 1 month, we can assess short-term capital inflow and determine market overheating. Although Bitcoin’s price has reached an all-time high, short-term capital inflow is not as rapid as during past peaks.” He wrote in a post shared on CryptoQuant. He further observed that a handful of short-term holders have accumulated gains since the recent spike in Bitcoin’s price. Notably, a large profit-taking and prolonged correction season was followed in 2024. However, profit-taking at this time is significantly below levels seen in November 2024, the analyst remarked, adding that whale profit-taking is still very limited, despite Bitcoin successfully reaching a new all-time high. On another note, Bitcoin holdings in the spot ETF market have hit a new all-time high, per the analysts’ assertion. “The increased holdings by retail and institutional investors, especially in the US, significantly support the overall market uptrend.” He wrote. At report time, Bitcoin was down 0.23% from the last hour and was trading at a price of $108,994.

In paperwork released by the US Office of Government Ethics on May 25, Brian Quintenz disclosed his key positions in crypto and market firms that would directly relate to the CFTC’s regulatory priorities and disclosed assets worth at least $3.4 million, according to a May 27 Bloomberg report. Quintenz was a CFTC commissioner from 2017 to 2021 and is currently the global head of crypto policy at Andreessen Horowitz , a position he said he will step down from if the Senate confirms him as CFTC chair. He holds an interest in three AH Capital Management investment funds, CNK Fund III, CNK Seed 1 Fund, and CNK IV Fund, plus capital commitments to related general partners. He is also a board member of the prediction markets platform Kalshi and owns stock and unvested stock options in the firm, along with stock and vested stock options in the finance and lending brokerage Next Level Derivatives. His portfolio intersects directly with two major CFTC policy areas, crypto asset regulation and prediction markets. Kalshi settled a major legal battle with the CFTC over election betting earlier this month. Quintenz outlined the steps he will take to avoid conflicts of interest if confirmed as CFTC chairman in an agreement letter to John Einstman, the CFTC’s Designated Agency Ethics Official, dated May 21. “I will not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter in which I know that I have a financial interest directly and predictably affected by the matter,” he stated.

2025-05-28T05:00:38.000Z,"TRON’s Correlation With Bitcoin Could Mean Massive Gains, Here’s Why","TRON (TRX) has been gaining upward momentum alongside the broader cryptocurrency market, reflecting strong price performance in recent weeks. The crypto asset has climbed over 10% in the past month, with its current price at $0.2748, reflecting a modest 0.7% increase in the past 24 hours. While not grabbing headlines with dramatic surges, TRX’s steady growth aligns closely with the broader bullish cycle led by Bitcoin (BTC), suggesting that it may benefit from macro-level investor sentiment. A recent analysis by Carmelo Alemán, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, highlights the increasing relevance of TRON in this market phase. Related Reading: Tron Bulls Regain Control – On-Chain Data Shows Fresh Buying Pressure Bitcoin Correlation Fuels Investor Optimism Alemán’s report, titled “The Crypto Elite Grows with Bitcoin and Why TRX Holds a Special Place,” explores how assets that demonstrate high correlation with Bitcoin, such as TRX, tend to mirror BTC’s market movements. This statistical connection, typically measured through correlation coefficients like Pearson’s, means that Bitcoin’s gains or retracements often influence similar movements in tokens like TRON. According to Alemán, the ongoing Bitcoin bull market, expected by some to last through Q4 2025, sets a favorable context for assets with strong historical correlation to BTC. Tokens, including TRX, SUI, ADA, XLM, HBAR, and Litecoin, are often observed to track Bitcoin’s behavior, rising during rallies and pulling back during corrections. For many investors, these assets present attractive opportunities given their lower market capitalizations compared to Bitcoin, making them capable of delivering larger percentage gains during bullish conditions. The analyst said: In practical terms, Bitcoin is unlikely to grow more than 2x from its current price, whereas highly correlated tokens could triple, quadruple, or more, simply because their smaller market caps make such expansions more feasible. In particular, Alemán draws attention to TRON’s upward momentum and growing network activity, especially in Asia. Notably, TRON recently surpassed Ethereum in the volume of USDT (Tether) issued on its network, signaling a shift in real-world utility and adoption. Alemán wrote: This is no small development: it reflects a restructuring in real network usage, and suggests that Tron could multiply significantly in value in the coming months, as it continues to move in tandem with Bitcoin’s trend. TRON Long-Term Growth Potential Beyond price action, Alemán also underscores TRON’s position in strategic portfolio planning. Because of its correlation with Bitcoin and its smaller relative size, TRON offers potential leverage to BTC’s market cycles. For long-term holders and tactical traders alike, this dynamic presents opportunities for outperformance during phases of sustained Bitcoin growth. Related Reading: TRON Accumulation Phase Detected—Major Price Surge Coming Alemán concludes by advising market participants to remain attentive to on-chain indicators and inter-asset relationships, emphasizing that informed decisions based on correlation dynamics could enhance portfolio returns during this cycle.

Five commissioners are supposed to make up the CFTC, and no more than three can be from the same political party.Goldsmith Romero said that during her tenure, all the commissioners had different perspectives and experiences that, when brought together, were “really helpful.”“So what happens if the CFTC gets down to one and gets new authority for crypto? It’s going to be really, really hard; you’re not going to have the same push and pull,” she said.The Trump administration has floated the idea of handing the reins of crypto regulation to the CFTC in the past.

2025-05-28T02:11:48.000Z,"Real-world assets could revitalize dying NFT lending market: DappRadar","Real-world assets linking up with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is one of a few key catalysts that could reignite the waning NFT lending sector, which is suffering from a collapse in volumes and user activity, says blockchain analytics platform DappRadar.Volumes in the NFT lending market, which allows NFT holders to take out a loan against their token, have dropped 97% from a peak of around $1 billion in January 2024 to $50 million in May, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a May 27 report.Gherghelas said for NFT lending to “move beyond survival mode,” it needs “new catalysts” to reignite the sector, such as real-world asset NFTs, like tokenized real estate or yield-bearing assets that could unlock more stable, trusted collateral sources.“So far, 2025 has not delivered a compelling reason for NFT lending to bounce back,” she said. “While the infrastructure is still here and the platforms remain active, activity has slowed across the board.” Borrower and leading activity have taken a big hit in the NFT lending sector. Source: DappRadar“For now, the sector seems to be in a holding pattern, waiting either for market recovery or a new use case to reignite interest.”Gherghelas added that other catalysts that could rekindle NFT lending were tools that make it easier for NFT holders to borrow against their tokens, and that protocols should create “smart infrastructure” such as undercollateralized loans, credit scores and artificial intelligence risk matching.The report adds that since January last year, borrower activity has declined by 90% and those willing to lend have shrunk by 78%.The average NFT loan size has also taken a hit from a peak of $22,000 in 2022 to $4,000 in May, a 71% year-over-year drop.Gherghelas said this shift “shows that either users are borrowing against lower-value assets or simply becoming more conservative with leverage.”NFT lending overall trading volume and market activity have dropped off from the all-time highs of past years. Source: DappRadarThe average loan duration is also lower; after hitting an average of roughly 40 days in 2023, it’s been down to 31 days and has held steady throughout 2024 and into 2025.Gherghelas said this could indicate that “loans are being taken more frequently but for shorter periods, perhaps a sign of more tactical liquidity plays.”NFT ﻿market downturn also hurts lendingPart of the slowdown in NFT lending is connected to the overall NFT market decline, which has seen volumes drop 61% in the first quarter to $1.5 billion compared to $4.1 billion a year ago.“With collateral value collapsing, the lending activity naturally followed,” Gherghelas said. “There are a few exceptions that managed to hold or regain traction, but they’ve been outliers, not enough to lift the sector.”Related: AI decentralized apps are coming for the Web3 throne: DappRadarThe protocol landscape has also narrowed, and the number of active NFT lending apps is limited, with only eight protocols holding any meaningful share.“The flip-for-liquidity model that worked during bull markets isn’t built for a quieter, more risk-averse environment. But that doesn’t mean NFT lending is finished; it’s simply shifting focus,” Gherghelas said.“Platforms are diversifying, use cases are shifting, and collateral preferences are changing. If the next wave builds on utility, culture, and better design, NFT lending might just find its second wind — one built to last.”Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-world-assets-revitalize-dying-nft-lending-dappradar?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

SharpLink will invest $425 million to acquire 120,000 ETH. Ethereum futures open interest hits an all-time high of $36.1 billion, with ETH price climbing 4.5% on the daily chart. Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming (SBET) announced a $425 million private investment in public equity (PIPE), acquiring approximately 69.1 million shares at $6.15 each to establish the first Nasdaq-listed Ethereum (ETH) treasury company.Spearheaded by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, this move mirrors Strategy’s (MSTR) successful Bitcoin treasury strategy, which has yielded over $8.2 billion in gains in 2025, by leveraging stock and bond sales to acquire BTC.Former Ethereum core developer and contributor Eric Conner highlighted the bullish implications of SharpLink’s move, noting its potential to create a “public ETH proxy for funds that can’t hold tokens directly.” Conner emphasized that the acquisition of 120,000 ETH—likely to be staked—could lead to “supply compression” by removing tokens from circulation. The Ether proponent also pointed to the “new narrative fuel” this provides, positioning ETH as a “digital reserve collateral” and potentially driving its adoption on mainstream balance sheets through an equity wrapper like $SBET.However, crypto analyst VICTOR cautioned against over-enthusiasm, outlining the risk of leveraging gains from an altcoin still down 19% in 2025. In Q1 2025, Cointelegraph reported a sharp decline in Ethereum network fees, dropping to $605,000 from $2.5 million in just two weeks in March, alongside a noticeable decrease in decentralized app (DApp) activity.

The majority of these rallies—eight out of ten—resulted in negative returns, while one rally triggered a short squeeze, driving prices higher, and another displayed neutral price action.From a technical perspective, Ether’s price action on the daily chart posted a descending triangle, a bullish breakout pattern, which creates equal highs and higher lows, converging toward an imminent rally. The pattern is bordered by two trendlines, the upper resistance, currently around $2,700 and the ascending support line. A bullish breakout above $2,677 targets the pattern’s measured move, calculated by adding the triangle’s height to the breakout point.

Speaking at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, Sigel said the most viable path forward may involve inserting Bitcoin mining incentives into the congressional budget reconciliation process.According to Sigel, the most effective path to growing a US strategic Bitcoin reserve would be through targeted amendments to congressional budget legislation. These could include tax credits for mining companies that use methane gas and other incentives aimed at encouraging miners to share a portion of their mined BTC with the federal government. He argued that such an approach would allow the reserve to grow organically over time. Sigel also highlighted the limitations of executive actions in achieving this goal:\""The problem with executive action is that it's going to prompt lawsuits. And anything over $100 million is going to get sued by the Elizabeth Warrens of the world. So, I would say start with something maybe in the Exchange Stabilization Fund for $100 million.\""US President Donald Trump established the US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve through a March 7 executive order. According to the order, the US government can only acquire Bitcoin through budget-neutral strategies or asset forfeiture, prompting a range of different ideas on how to add to the government’s stockpile of nearly 200,000 BTC.From left to right, Alex Thorn, Matthew Sigel, Matthew Pines and Fred Thiel.

FalconX, a digital asset broker, said it secured a facility worth over $100 million as part of a “broader credit framework,” while Maple Finance reportedly closed the first tranche of an agreement with Cantor.The service allows companies holding Bitcoin to borrow funds and use the cryptocurrency as collateral, providing a way to unlock liquidity without selling their BTC holdings. Cantor announced its Bitcoin financing business with an initial capital of $2 billion in July 2024, targeting institutional investors seeking to leverage their Bitcoin. At the time, the company said Anchorage Digital and Copper would serve as custodians and collateral managers in the venture.Credit markets are a fundamental part of the financial system, allowing capital to flow between borrowers and lenders and supporting economic activity across sectors. Their central role also means they can contribute to financial distress when risks are mismanaged. While mirroring some functions of traditional finance, crypto credit markets have been operating with less regulatory oversight.Digital asset crisis of 2022 This dynamic was evident during the 2022 crisis in the digital asset sector. Celsius Network, once a leading crypto lending platform, collapsed after engaging in risky financial practices and facing allegations of fraud. Similarly, BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2022 following significant exposure to the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.  According to a report from Galaxy, the total crypto lending market, including crypto-backed collateralized debt positions (CDPs) tied to stablecoins, stood at $36.5 billion in the last quarter of 2024, marking a 43% decline from its all-time high of $64.4 billion in 2021. Despite the broader contraction, onchain lending platforms have seen a dramatic rebound, with open borrowed positions surging to $19.1 billion by Q4 2024, a 959% increase over two years.

The macroeconomic-focused Bitcoin newsletter highlighted that the National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) shows a rapid shift to ultra-loose territory after a tightening phase in February 2025. The NFCI, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, tracks stress in the financial system by aggregating measures like credit spreads, leverage, and funding conditions. When the index moves into looser territory, it reflects easier access to capital and reduced market stress—conditions that typically encourage risk-taking behavior among investors. For high-beta assets like Bitcoin, such periods often coincide with price rallies as capital flows into speculative markets.US National Financial Conditions Index.

2025-05-27T15:40:00.000Z,"93% of all Bitcoin is already mined. Here’s what that means","How much Bitcoin is left to mine?              Bitcoin’s total supply is hardcoded at 21 million BTC, a fixed upper limit that cannot be altered without a consensus-breaking change to the protocol. This finite cap is enforced at the protocol level and is central to Bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset.As of May 2025, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoin (BTC) have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created, and those remaining coins will be mined very slowly.The reason for this uneven distribution is Bitcoin’s exponential issuance schedule, governed by an event called the halving. When Bitcoin launched in 2009, the block reward was 50 BTC. Every 210,000 blocks — or approximately every four years — that reward is cut in half. Because the early rewards were so large, over 87% of the total supply was mined by the end of 2020. Each subsequent halving sharply reduces the rate of new issuance, meaning it will take over a century to mine the remaining 6.7%.According to current estimates, 99% of all Bitcoin will have been mined by 2035, but the final fraction — the last satoshis — won’t be produced until around the year 2140 due to the nature of geometric reward reduction.This engineered scarcity, combined with an immutable supply cap, is what draws comparisons between Bitcoin and physical commodities like gold. But Bitcoin is even more predictable: Gold’s supply grows at around 1.7% annually, whereas Bitcoin’s issuance rate is transparently declining.Did you know? Bitcoin’s supply curve is not terminal in the traditional sense. It follows an asymptotic trajectory — a kind of economic Zeno’s paradox — where rewards diminish indefinitely but never truly reach zero. Mining will continue until around 2140, by which point over 99.999% of the total 21 million BTC will have been issued.                  Beyond the supply cap: How lost coins make Bitcoin scarcer than you think              While over 93% of Bitcoin’s total supply has been mined, that doesn’t mean it’s all available. A significant portion is permanently out of circulation, lost due to forgotten passwords, misplaced wallets, destroyed hard drives or early adopters who never touched their coins again.Estimates from firms like Chainalysis and Glassnode suggest that between 3.0 million and 3.8 million BTC — roughly 14%-18% of the total supply — is likely gone for good. That includes high-profile dormant addresses like the one believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, which alone holds over 1.1 million BTC.This means Bitcoin’s true circulating supply may be closer to 16 million-17 million, not 21 million. And because Bitcoin is non-recoverable by design, any lost coins stay lost — permanently reducing supply over time.Now compare that to gold. Around 85% of the world’s total gold supply has been mined — approximately 216,265 metric tons, according to the World Gold Council — but nearly all of it remains in circulation or held in vaults, jewelry, ETFs and central banks. Gold can be remelted and reused; Bitcoin cannot be resurrected once access is lost.This distinction gives Bitcoin a kind of hardening scarcity, a supply that not only stops growing over time but quietly shrinks.As Bitcoin matures, it’s entering a monetary phase similar to gold: low issuance, high holder concentration and increasing demand-side sensitivity. But Bitcoin takes it further; its supply cap is hard, its loss rate is permanent, and its distribution is publicly auditable.This may lead to several outcomes:Increased price volatility as available supply becomes more limited and sensitive to market demandHigher long-term value concentration in the hands of those who remain active and secure in their key managementA premium on liquidity, where actually spendable BTC trades at a higher effective value than dormant supply.In extreme cases, this could produce a bifurcation between “circulating BTC” and “unreachable BTC,” with the former gaining greater economic significance, particularly in times of constrained exchange liquidity or macroeconomic stress.                  What happens when Bitcoin is fully mined?              There’s a popular assumption that as Bitcoin’s block rewards shrink, the network’s security will eventually suffer. But in practice, the mining economy is far more adaptive — and much more resilient — than that.Bitcoin’s mining incentives are governed by a self-correcting feedback loop: If mining becomes unprofitable, miners drop off the network, which in turn triggers a difficulty adjustment. Every 2,016 blocks (roughly every two weeks), the network recalibrates mining difficulty using a parameter known as nBits. The goal is to keep block times steady at around 10 minutes, regardless of how many miners are competing.So, if Bitcoin’s price drops, or the reward becomes too small relative to operating costs, inefficient miners simply exit. This causes difficulty to fall, lowering the cost for those who remain. The result is a system that continually rebalances itself, aligning network participation with available incentives.This mechanism has already been tested at scale. After China banned mining in mid-2021, Bitcoin’s global hashrate dropped by more than 50% in a matter of weeks. Yet the network continued to function without interruption, and within a few months, the hashrate fully recovered, as miners resumed operations in jurisdictions with lower energy costs and more favorable regulations.Critically, the idea that lower rewards will inherently threaten network security overlooks how mining is tied to profit margins, not nominal BTC amounts. As long as the market price supports the cost of hash power — even at 0.78125 BTC per block (post-2028 halving) or lower — miners will continue to secure the network.In other words, it’s not the absolute reward that matters, but whether mining remains profitable relative to costs. And thanks to Bitcoin’s built-in difficulty adjustment, it usually does.Even a century from now, when the block reward approaches zero, the network will likely still be protected by whatever combination of fees, base incentives and infrastructure efficiency exists at that time. But that’s a distant concern. In the meantime, the current system — hashrate adjusts, difficulty rebalances, miners adapt — remains one of the most robust elements of Bitcoin’s design.Did you know? On April 20, 2024, following the launch of the Runes protocol, Bitcoin miners earned over $80 million in transaction fees within a single day, surpassing the $26 million earned from block rewards. This marked the first time in Bitcoin’s history that transaction fees alone exceeded the block subsidy in daily miner revenue.                  The future of Bitcoin mining: Energy consumption              It’s a common misconception that rising Bitcoin prices will drive endless energy use. In reality, mining is constrained by profitability, not price alone.As block rewards shrink, miners are pushed toward thinner margins, and that means chasing the cheapest, cleanest energy available. Since China’s 2021 mining ban, hashrate has migrated to regions like North America and Northern Europe, where operators tap into surplus hydro, wind and underutilized grid energy.According to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, between 52% and 59% of Bitcoin mining now runs on renewables or low-emission sources. Regulations are reinforcing this trend, with several jurisdictions offering incentives for clean-powered mining or penalizing fossil-fuel operations.Moreover, the idea that higher BTC prices will always mean higher energy use misses how Bitcoin self-regulates: More miners raise difficulty, which compresses margins, capping energy expansion. Renewable-based mining brings its own challenges, but the dystopian future of endlessly expanding fossil-fueled hash power is increasingly unlikely.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/93-of-all-bitcoin-is-already-mined-heres-what-that-means?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T15:00:00.000Z,"ZKPs can prove I&#039;m old enough without telling you my age","Opinion by: Andre Omietanski, General Counsel, and Amal Ibraymi, Legal Counsel at Aztec LabsWhat if you could prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthday, name, or anything else at all? Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) make this hypothetical a reality and solve one of the key challenges online: verifying age without sacrificing privacy. The need for better age verification todayWe're witnessing an uptick in laws being proposed restricting minors' access to social media and the internet, including in Australia, Florida, and China. To protect minors from inappropriate adult content, platform owners and governments often walk a tightrope between inaction and overreach. For example, the state of Louisiana in the US recently enacted a law meant to block minors from viewing porn. Sites required users to upload an ID before viewing content. The Free Speech Coalition challenged the law as unconstitutional, making the case that it infringed on First Amendment rights. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed on procedural grounds. The reaction, however, highlights the dilemma facing policymakers and platforms: how to block minors without violating adults' rights or creating new privacy risks.Traditional age verification failsCurrent age verification tools are either ineffective or invasive. Self-declaration is meaningless, since users can simply lie about their age. ID-based verification is overly invasive. No one should be required to upload their most sensitive documents, putting themselves at risk of data breaches and identity theft. Biometric solutions like fingerprints and face scans are convenient for users but raise important ethical, privacy, and security concerns. Biometric systems are not always accurate and may generate false positives and negatives. The irreversible nature of the data, which can't be changed like a regular password can, is also less than ideal. Other methods, like behavioral tracking and AI-driven verification of browser patterns, are also problematic, using machine learning to analyze user interactions and identify patterns and anomalies, raising concerns of a surveillance culture.ZKPs as the privacy-preserving solutionZero-knowledge proofs present a compelling solution. Like a government ID provider, a trusted entity verifies the user's age and generates a cryptographic proof confirming they are over the required age. Websites only need to check the proof, not the excess personal data, ensuring privacy while keeping minors at the gates. No centralized data storage is required, alleviating the burden on platforms such as Google, Meta, and WhatsApp and eliminating the risk of data breaches. Recent: How zero-knowledge proofs can make AI fairerAdopting and enforcing ZKPs at scaleZKPs aren't a silver bullet. They can be complex to implement. The notion of \""don't trust, verify,\"" proven by indisputable mathematics, may cause some regulatory skepticism. Policymakers may hesitate to trust cryptographic proofs over visible ID verification. There are occasions when companies may need to disclose personal information to authorities, such as during an investigation into financial crimes or government inquiries. This would challenge ZKPs, whose very intention is for platforms not to hold this data in the first place.ZKPs also struggle with scalability and performance, being somewhat computationally intensive and tricky to program. Efficient implementation techniques are being explored, and breakthroughs, such as the Noir programming language, are making ZKPs more accessible to developers, driving the adoption of secure, privacy-first solutions. A safer, smarter future for age verificationGoogle's move to adopt ZKPs for age verification is a promising signal that mainstream platforms are beginning to embrace privacy-preserving technologies. But to fully realize the potential of ZKPs, we need more than isolated solutions locked into proprietary ecosystems. Crypto-native wallets can go further. Open-source and permissionless blockchain-based systems offer interoperability, composability, and programmable identity. With a single proof, users can access a range of services across the open web — no need to start from scratch every time, or trust a single provider (Google) with their credentials.ZKPs flip the script on online identity — proving what matters, without exposing anything else. They protect user privacy, help platforms stay compliant, and block minors from restricted content, all without creating new honeypots of sensitive data.Google's adoption of ZKPs shows mainstream momentum is building. But to truly transform digital identity, we must embrace crypto-native, decentralized systems that give users control over what they share and who they are online.In an era defined by surveillance, ZKPs offer a better path forward — one that's secure, private, and built for the future.Opinion by: Andre Omietanski, General Counsel, and Amal Ibraymi, Legal Counsel at Aztec Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-27T14:30:00.000Z,"What is a cryptocurrency mixer and how does it work?","Cryptocurrency mixers explained              A cryptocurrency mixer is a specialized service designed to increase the privacy and anonymity of blockchain transactions. Unlike traditional financial transactions, which are private by default, most cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) operate on public blockchains. This means every transaction is permanently recorded and accessible to anyone, making it possible for blockchain analysts or malicious actors to trace the flow of funds between wallets.A crypto mixer’s primary function is to break the link between the sender’s wallet and the recipient’s wallet. It does so by pooling together coins from many users and then redistributing them in a way that makes it difficult to track which coins went where. Think of it like a digital version of shuffling cards in a deck. After mixing, your cryptocurrency is returned to you or a recipient’s address, but it’s “cleaned” of any direct transaction history.This privacy-enhancing feature is why some people rely on mixers, especially those seeking to keep their financial activities confidential in an open-ledger world.                  How does a crypto mixer work?              To understand a crypto mixer, it’s useful to compare it to the concept of money laundering in traditional finance, albeit with legal and ethical nuances. The process of “mixing” is essentially designed to obscure the origin and destination of coins.Here’s a typical workflow of how a cryptocurrency mixer operates:Deposit: You send your cryptocurrency to the mixer’s wallet address. Multiple users do the same, creating a large pool of coins.Mixing/shuffling: The mixer’s system pools and shuffles these coins together, breaking any visible connection between deposited and withdrawn funds.Redistribution: After mixing, the service sends back an equivalent amount of coins to your specified address, but these aren’t the same coins you deposited. They come from the pooled coins of all participants.Fees: The mixer usually deducts a small fee, generally ranging from 1% to 3%, to cover operational costs.This process effectively disrupts blockchain analysis, making it extremely difficult for anyone to trace the coins back to their original owners.                  Types of cryptocurrency mixers              Not all mixers are created equal. They can broadly be divided into two categories: centralized and decentralized mixers.Centralized mixersCentralized mixers are the most common and operate similarly to traditional services. You send your coins to a company or entity that controls the mixing process, and then they send back “clean” coins after mixing. These services are relatively easy to use, often providing a simple user interface.However, centralized mixers require you to trust the service operator with your coins, at least temporarily. This introduces risks such as:The mixer could be a scam and disappear with your funds.It could be hacked, exposing users’ data and coins.The operator may keep logs that could compromise your privacy.Decentralized mixersDecentralized mixers use blockchain technology and smart contracts to automate the mixing process without a trusted third party. They rely on cryptographic methods such as zero-knowledge proofs to mix coins in a trustless environment. Users pool their coins into a smart contract, which then redistributes coins in a way that ensures privacy.Advantages of decentralized mixers include:No central point of failure or custody risk.Higher privacy because no single party controls the funds.Often more resistant to regulatory crackdowns.Did you know? The DOJ indicted four Russians for operating crypto mixers Blender.io and Sinbad.io, yet failed to show they knowingly laundered illicit funds. The indictment relies heavily on vague forum posts and lacks concrete evidence of criminal intent or ties to US commerce, raising serious doubts about its strength in court.                  Real-world cases involving mixers and scams              Unfortunately, the privacy offered by crypto mixers has also attracted criminals. The very anonymity that protects innocent users can also shield illicit activities, leading to widespread misuse.Crypto mixers have been linked to ransomware attacks, dark web marketplaces, fraud and drug trafficking. Criminals often use these services to “clean” proceeds from illegal transactions and hide their tracks from law enforcement.A notable example is ChipMixer, a service seized by Europol in 2023 for allegedly facilitating money laundering for dark web markets and ransomware groups. Authorities dismantled the platform’s infrastructure over alleged money laundering, seizing four servers, 1,909.4 BTC (about $210 million as of May 26, 2025) and seven TB of data across 55 transactions.Mixers have also been involved in laundering stolen funds from cryptocurrency exchange hacks. The complexity of these transactions makes it difficult for investigators to recover stolen assets.In February 2025, Bybit, a major cryptocurrency exchange, suffered a significant security breach resulting in the theft of about $1.5 billion worth of cryptocurrencies. The attackers, attributed to the Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking organization, employed various crypto mixers, including Wasabi, CryptoMixer, Railgun and Tornado Cash, to launder portions of the stolen assets. Despite efforts to trace the funds, a significant portion remains unaccounted for, highlighting the challenges posed by mixers in cybersecurity investigations.                  Are crypto mixers legal?              The legal status of cryptocurrency mixers depends largely on the jurisdiction and context of their use.Most governments impose strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing regulations on financial services, including digital currency services. Mixers, by their nature, complicate AML compliance because they obscure transaction trails.For instance,In the European Union, the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD) includes digital currency providers under its regulatory scope, requiring them to perform KYC checks and report suspicious activity.In the United States, FinCEN classifies cryptocurrency mixers as money transmitters, requiring registration and compliance with AML regulations. Unlicensed mixers can face severe penalties and criminal charges.Legal uses vs misuseUsing a mixer for privacy reasons is not inherently illegal. However, if mixers are used to launder proceeds from crimes, authorities will prosecute offenders. Similarly, operating a mixer without appropriate licenses or regulatory oversight can be illegal.If you choose to use a mixer, make sure you understand the legal implications in your country and avoid any activity that could be linked to money laundering or fraud.Did you know? Crypto mixer transactions are still taxable. Using a mixer doesn’t hide gains from tax authorities; failing to report them can trigger audits or penalties. Always keep records and understand your local tax obligations.                  How to stay safe and avoid scam-linked mixers              If you decide to use a cryptocurrency mixer, your safety and security should be paramount. Here are some essential tips to avoid scams and legal troubles:Choose reputable mixers: Conduct thorough research. Look for mixers with good reviews, transparent operations and clear compliance policies.Avoid unknown or suspicious services: Steer clear of mixers linked to scams, hacks or regulatory actions.Check for licensing and compliance: Prefer mixers that comply with AML/KYC regulations, especially if you are a business or high-value user.Understand fees and timelines: Be clear on the fees involved and the expected time for your funds to be returned after mixing.Use hardware wallets and strong security practices: Always safeguard your private keys and use hardware wallets to minimize risks.Stay updated on regulations: Laws surrounding crypto mixers evolve rapidly. Staying informed will help you avoid inadvertent legal violations.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-mixer-and-how-does-it-work?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T13:19:38.000Z,"How to research altcoins using ChatGPT and Grok","Investments in the fast-paced cryptocurrency market require real-time insights and efficient research. With thousands of projects emerging or disappearing, you need innovative ways to separate signal from noise. AI solutions such as ChatGPT and Grok could benefit you as your research assistant, reducing research time and delivering actionable information. This article discusses how to use both platforms to make better decisions regarding investment in altcoins.How to share content with ChatGPT and GrokBoth ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 allow you to share content in three ways. You can simply paste content in the text box with inverted commas and write your prompt. Alternatively, you can upload a document from your local drive or Google Drive on ChatGPT 4o. If you are working with Grok 3, you could upload a file from your local drive or connect a file on Google Drive and Microsoft Drive to the AI platform.On both ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3, you can paste a link in the text box and write a prompt for the AI engine.Use ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 to analyze complex data and draw quick conclusionsChatGPT 4o excels at processing and simplifying extensive and often fragmented information. Altcoin projects tend to have extensive white papers and technical documentation. It takes time to get through all the information, analyze it, and draw conclusions. With ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3, you can easily get the information you need without spending hours reading the content. You can use the AI platforms for:Summarizing extensive documentation: You could get a quick summary of vast information that might go into thousands of words, using a prompt like “Summarize this document in plain English with pros, cons and use cases.”Analyzing tokenomics: You could ask the AI platforms for the altcoin project’s breakdown of inflation, token distribution and staking models. For example, you could use a prompt such as “Explain the tokenomics of [Altcoin Name] and its impact on price.” Deconstructing roadmaps: Projects often publish unrealistic roadmaps that are hard to implement. AI platforms could quickly analyze the relevancy of roadmaps and suggest to you what you could expect of them. You could use prompts like, “What are the most realistic milestones in this roadmap for 2025?”Spotting red flags: The goal is not just to understand but to spot red flags, such as overpromising, vague goals or lack of technical updates. Did you know? ChatGPT is trained on vast crypto data sets and can explain trends, decode memes, or simplify DeFi tools — even if you are just starting your crypto learning journey.Ask for competitive comparisons on ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 can be valuable tools for quickly comparing different cryptocurrency projects. To begin with, state the names of the cryptocurrencies you want to compare. Also mention the criteria such as use case, consensus process, tokenomics and development activities. For example, you can use the prompt, “Create a table comparing Solana and Avalanche in terms of transaction speed, fees and developer adoption.” Here is a response from ChatGPT 4o:And this is Grok 3’s response for the same prompt:AI tools typically use tables or bullet points for an answer. You can also ask additional questions to delve deeper into topics like security, scalability and partnerships. This allows for more efficient evaluation of many projects without the need to search through multiple sources.To get a market-layer view on ChatGPT 4o, you can use the prompt: “Create a table of five layer-1 altcoins with higher throughput than Ethereum and evaluate their adoption metrics.” Here is the output of ChatGPT 4o:Grok 3 gave the following response using the same prompt:These comparisons help you map out where each altcoin stands relative to its peers and whether it offers a genuine edge.Did you know? Elon Musk’s Grok chatbot was built with a rebellious tone. It excels at quickly pulling crypto insights directly from social chatter, perfect for memecoin hunters.Find info about developer activityDeveloper traction is a dependable indicator of an altcoin’s long-term potential. Use ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 to find information about overall growth in development activity, surges after certain upgrades, developer count and contributions, commit activity, network upgrades and challenges before developers.You could use prompts like:“What has been the developer activity trend on [Project ] over the last 6 months?”You can also request ecosystem breakdowns with prompts like:“List top DeFi projects built on Arbitrum with TVL over $10 million.”ChatGPT 4o generated the following response for this prompt:Here is Grok 3’s response for the same prompt:ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 can synthesize data points from multiple sources and give you a cleaner picture faster than manual web browsing. You could track sudden price spikes with a prompt like:“In 100 words, write why is $RNDR trending right now?”Here is ChatGPT 4o’s response for this prompt:This is Grok 3’s response for the same prompt:Grok 3 is particularly useful for monitoring real-time sentiment and news. Grok 3 is ideal for real-time analysis of trends, especially on X, where crypto narratives form quickly. Grok 3 will pull recent posts, mentions and news threads to explain the momentum. It can monitor influencer sentiment.For deeper and quicker research, you can use ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 together.Don’t just trust the bots — verify the alphaAI tools like ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3 offer powerful support in the altcoin research process, enabling faster analysis, broader comparisons and streamlined access to information. However, even advanced AI models can occasionally misinterpret data or miss contextual nuances. As such, it is essential to treat their responses as a starting point — not a final answer.When using these tools, take the time to compare outputs, evaluate the sources referenced, and cross-check insights against real-world data. Discrepancies between ChatGPT and Grok responses should prompt further investigation, not automatic preference.Ultimately, these platforms are most effective when used to enhance critical thinking and research efficiency rather than replace human judgment.In a fast-moving industry like Web3, effective research requires diligence, curiosity and verification. By applying these principles, you can make more confident and informed investment decisions in the altcoin space.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-27T12:00:15.000Z,"StarkWare launches mobile-friendly zero-knowledge prover","Blockchain company StarkWare has unveiled zero-knowledge (ZK) prover STARK Two (S-two), enabling enhanced privacy and verification on everyday devices like phones, laptops and browsers. The company said the new ZK prover allows users to generate complex cryptographic proofs from the client side. This means users can generate ZK-proofs directly on their devices instead of relying on a server or cloud infrastructure, opening the door for faster and more private applications across the internet. “S-two will bring STARK proving to everyday devices, and open the door for new real-world proving use cases,” said Eli Ben-Sasson, StarkWare co-founder and CEO, adding that the tool could empower the next wave of ZK applications. The company said the ZK prover is now available in public alpha and is set to roll out on Starknet, its Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, later this year.  StarkWare says new ZK prover is 39 times faster than old solutions StarkWare said that benchmark tests for the S-two ZK prover showed that it was 39 times faster than previous solutions. The performance leap enables smoother experiences in privacy-enhancing applications. The upgrade also allows use cases in private transactions, ZK-based identity and verifiable artificial intelligence. StarkWare said S-two runs on CPUs, GPUs and will soon be on browsers. “For years we’ve called the prover our magic wand, a tool that transforms complex computation into a simple proof,” Ben-Sasson said. “Now, the wand has become a lightsaber in your pocket, something anyone can wield, instantly, from your own device.”According to StarkWare, developers can build with S-two, adding that its alpha release supports hardware targets. Furthermore, the company said ZK ecosystem participants like Kakarot, Nexus, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs have already adopted the technology. Kakarot uses S-two inside ETHProofs to generate Ethereum block proofs more efficiently, while Nexus is standardizing RISC-V traces to align with S-two’s architecture. Meanwhile, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs are adding GPU acceleration to push the prover’s performance even further.Use cases for S-two zero-knowledge proverStarkWare chief operating officer Oren Katz told Cointelegraph that S-two marks a shift in how ZK-proofs are used in daily lives. Generating validity proofs directly in devices will allow privacy-preserving features in messaging, payments and digital identity. “You can prove a payment was valid without showing your balance, or verify identity without revealing personal details,” Katz added. Katz said that even salary payments could be made onchain with full transparency and no exposure of sensitive information. He dubbed the development a “big step toward bringing zero-knowledge tech into the mainstream.”Beyond privacy, Katz said, local proof generation also unlocks use cases in other industries. The executive told Cointelegraph that it can allow gamers to play offline and later generate cryptographic proof of their achievements. “An operator, instead of running all logic onchain to prove integrity, can run it on their own servers and simply generate a proof that it was executed correctly,” Katz added.Related: Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden’s cashless-society rethinkNew ZK prover follows Ethereum’s privacy pushThe launch of StarWare’s upgraded ZK prover follows Ethereum’s push for better privacy. On April 11, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin published a roadmap that addressed privacy enhancements for wallets, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and infrastructure. Buterin advocated implementing privacy-enhancing norms and features across the Ethereum ecosystem, including adding privacy tools in ETH wallets. Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/starkware-unveils-s-two-client-side-zk-prover?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Subscriptions to BGUSD can be made using either USDC (USDC) or USDt (USDT), and the asset is redeemable back to USDC on demand.The company said the yield is derived from a basket of tokenized instruments, including US Treasury bills and high-grade money-market funds. “These assets are managed via partnerships with regulated institutional tokenization providers such as Superstate,” Bitget CEO Gracy Chen told Cointelegraph.The product’s structure is designed to reduce exposure to crypto volatility while delivering returns through traditional financial instruments. Bitget to roll out third-party attestationsIn response to questions about transparency, Chen said that Bitget is preparing to roll out third-party attestations to provide visibility into BGUSD’s asset backing.“Transparency and accountability are core principles of BGUSD’s framework,” she said. “While independent attestations are in the works, our institutional partners are already subject to rigorous audit requirements and regulatory oversight.”Chen clarified how Bitget maintains liquidity for users who want to redeem BGUSD. The executive said Bitget directly manages the reserve pool, which includes stable, on-hand assets like USDC. According to Chen, BGUSD does not fall under the definitions of a stablecoin or a security and is not subject to specific licensing requirements. “It’s structured as a yield-bearing stable asset certificate that’s exclusive to the Bitget platform,” Chen told Cointelegraph.Chen added that Bitget will limit access to BGUSD in jurisdictions where digital asset restrictions apply.  Related: Stablecoins’ dominance due to limitations of US banking — Jerald DavidYield-bearing stablecoins surge to $11 billionBitget’s move into yield-bearing stablecoins comes as the asset class has surged to $11 billion. According to a Pendle report, yield-bearing stablecoins climbed from $1.5 billion at the start of 2024 to $11 billion as of May 21. This represents 4.5% of the entire stablecoin market. The growth of yield-bearing stablecoins is attributed to increasing regulatory clarity in the United States under President Donald Trump’s administration. According to a Feb. 18 filing, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved exchange operator Figure Markets’ interest-bearing stablecoin. This made the company the first to receive US approval for a yield-bearing stablecoin. Apart from a favorable response from the SEC, proposed bills like the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) also signal a positive direction for stablecoins in the US. Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitget-enters-real-world-asset-race-with-yield-bearing-bgusd-stablecoin?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T08:45:00.000Z,"How central banks are testing blockchain-based monetary policy","Why are central banks looking at blockchains?              Central banks are tiptoeing into the world of blockchain not because it is fashionable but because every part of the money-making machine, from settlement rails to asset custody, is slowly being rewritten as code.The financial industry is already tokenizing money-market funds, Treasurys and even bank deposits. According to the Atlantic Council, 134 jurisdictions are studying or piloting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), up from just 35 in 2020. Meanwhile, commercial banks have begun to warn that if they cannot move tokenized deposits across public blockchains such as Solana or private ledgers like R3 Corda, they risk being left behind.From a central bank’s vantage point, two questions matter:First, can traditional operations, such as open-market purchases, standing facilities and reserve remuneration still work if reserves and government bonds become smart tokens? Second, can monetary transmission improve when policy logic is hard-wired into code? These questions motivate pilots such as Project Pine, Project Guardian in Singapore, the Bank of England’s wholesale CBDC sandbox and Japan’s multiyear retail CBDC pilot.                  What is “tokenized” monetary policy?              Tokenized monetary policy means that the liabilities and assets a central bank uses to steer short-term interest rates exist as programmable tokens on a distributed-ledger platform. In such a token arrangement, what the BIS describes as an ecosystem where money and securities share a common ledger, monetary functions are executed by smart contracts, replacing the traditional batch file processes used in overnight real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems.In practice, each policy tool is expressed as code:Interest on reserves becomes an automated coupon that accrues to a wallet address once a block closes.Repo and reverse-repo agreements become conditional asset swaps that self-liquidate at maturity.Collateral haircuts are numeric parameters the central bank can toggle in real time, with changes propagating instantly to all counterparties.Project Pine demonstrated all three, using ERC-20 tokens for reserves and securities on a permissioned Ethereum-compatible chain.But how is tokenized monetary policy different from traditional monetary policy?Traditional policy operations rely on central bank systems such as Fedwire or the Bank of England’s RTGS. These systems close overnight, settle in discrete batches and require multiple human sign-offs. A tokenized system settles atomically in seconds, keeps an immutable audit trail and lets policy adjustments propagate without waiting for dealers to book trades. The BIS paper on tokenisation notes that combining assets and settlement on a single ledger can shrink operational risk and latency.Did you know? A repo is a short-term secured loan in which one party sells securities and agrees to repurchase them later at a higher price. In contrast, a reverse repo is the same transaction viewed from the counterparty’s perspective (buying the securities and later reselling them).                  What is Project Pine?              Project Pine is a research initiative led by the BIS Innovation Hub and the New York Fed that explores how central banks could run monetary policy in a future where money and government securities are digital tokens managed on blockchain-like systems.Launched in late 2024 and published in May 2025, the project built a working prototype, a “starter kit” for central banks, designed to test whether tools like interest on reserves, repo operations and asset purchases can be run using smart contracts.The project ran simulated financial scenarios, mimicking both calm and crisis conditions:Normal conditions: The smart contract automatically conducted a one-day reverse-repo, draining reserves by posting bids at a pre-set interest rate.Liquidity shock: When simulated market stress pushed interest rates too high, an emergency lending facility kicked in automatically, within seconds, helping stabilize rates.Asset-purchase program: The toolkit accepted bids, calculated allocations and settled trades between digital reserves and tokenized bonds instantly.These scenarios were run in a test environment with simulated commercial banks and a programmable blockchain platform. Everything from interest payments to collateral valuation was automated, providing a glimpse into how monetary policy might function in a 24/7, tokenized financial system.This was not an isolated experiment. Other central banks are running parallel pilots that explore similar ground with their distinct approaches:Although temporarily offline as of May 24, 2025, MAS news releases show that Singapore’s Project Guardian has tested tokenized deposits and government bonds in live repo transactions, proving that interbank settlement can occur on a shared DLT without sending payments through Swift.Meanwhile, the Bank of England has taken a dual-rail approach. A July 2024 discussion paper stresses that wholesale tokenized money could sit alongside RTGS balances, letting commercial banks pick whichever rail meets their liquidity needs. Governor Andrew Bailey has warned that if tokenized deposits stall, the Bank “must continue to prepare for a wholesale CBDC.”On the retail front, Japan’s multi-year programme has entered a live “pilot” phase, constructing an end-to-end infrastructure, from smartphone wallets to a central ledger, capable of handling tens of thousands of transactions per second. The pilot also explores privacy-enhancing overlays, reflecting consumer expectations for cash-like anonymity.Taken together, these pilots confirm that key features like programmability, real-time visibility, and atomic settlement are no longer theoretical — they work. They don’t yet answer the more challenging question: How do central banks transition an entire financial system to such rails without disrupting credit creation and intermediation?Did you know? Project Pine’s digital monetary system is built like a three-layer cake: The bottom layer is a programmable blockchain (Besu), the middle is packed with tokenized money and assets (like ERC-20 reserves) and the top layer runs the smart contracts that carry out monetary policy actions.                  Why is Project Pine important?              Project Pine is the first of its kind to show that core central bank tools could be rebuilt using smart contracts. It proves that:Policy tools can be deployed faster, possibly within seconds.Facilities like repo or asset purchases can adapt automatically to changing market conditions.Tokenization could streamline operations, reduce friction and offer greater flexibility.Who was involved in Project Pine experiments?Seven major central banks, including those of Australia, Canada, England, Mexico, Switzerland, the EU and the US, collaborated on shaping the toolkit and defining test requirements. The findings don’t commit any of these banks to adopt such systems, but they provide a solid foundation for future research and policymaking.What did Project Pine test?To see how well the system works, Project Pine ran tests based on real-world situations, such as raising interest rates or a government debt crisis. They tried short and long periods, small and large financial systems, tight and loose money conditions and different ways of lending (like bank loans or corporate bonds). This helped check if the system could handle all kinds of economic ups and downs.Did you know? In Project Pine, central bank operations like paying interest on reserves or managing collateral aren’t done manually; they're handled by smart contracts coded directly into the top “protocol layer” of the blockchain stack.                  Practical design challenges in tokenized monetary policy              As central banks explore moving policy tools onto blockchains, they face several significant design hurdles. These aren’t just technical. They’re legal, operational and even philosophical. Here are the key ones:Interoperability: Can different blockchains talk to each other? Today’s financial system is like a highway with shared rules. However, blockchain ecosystems are more like separate islands, each with its own rules and roads. Public networks like Solana, private ones like Corda, or permissioned platforms like Besu don’t always “talk” to each other smoothly. This can cause issues like payment delays or funds getting stuck between platforms. Experts also warn that if too many users gather around one dominant blockchain, it could create unhealthy concentration, making the whole system more fragile.Legal finality: Does blockchain data legally count? Many countries still treat blockchain records as transaction evidence, not legally binding proof of ownership. So, even if a tokenized treasury bond moves onchain, the law might still require a separate “golden record” kept offchain by a trusted authority. Until legal systems catch up, this split could limit how far tokenized finance can go.Cyber resilience: What happens when something goes wrong? Blockchain systems run on code, and that code can have bugs. In a traditional setup, if something breaks, humans can step in. But with smart contracts, “code is law.” That’s why countries like Japan are building complete backup plans into their pilots. They’re testing how to respond to cyberattacks, technical failures or even smart contract glitches because in a digital money system, even a small error could have significant consequences.Privacy vs transparency: How much should be visible? Banks and regulators need transparency to monitor financial risks and prevent crime. But regular people want privacy, especially when using money for everyday purchases. Balancing those two needs is tricky. Policymakers are now experimenting with ideas like tiered disclosure (more visibility for big transactions), zero-knowledge proofs (which let you prove something without revealing all details), and even “anonymity vouchers” that let users make some transactions without being tracked.These challenges aren’t deal-breakers, but they do show that making money programmable isn’t as simple as flipping a switch. Central banks must work closely with lawmakers, cybersecurity experts and the financial industry to ensure tokenized monetary systems are safe, fair and reliable.                  The road ahead              The future of tokenized monetary policy will likely unfold in carefully staged phases, balancing innovation with financial stability.The BIS Innovation Hub lists more than a dozen ongoing tokenization projects from Australia’s Project Dunbar (multi-CBDC bridge) to Switzerland’s Project Helvetia (DLT-based repo). Commercial banks, meanwhile, are shifting rails: HSBC settled its first tokenized-deposit payment in April 2025, and Euroclear is piloting blockchain settlement for tokenized bonds.Central banks face a coordination game: Go slow and risk private standards hardening around them; go too fast and upend the funding model of commercial banks. The likeliest path is a phased approach:Stage 1: Limited-scope wholesale CBDC sandboxes plus tokenized collateral for central-bank counterparties.Stage 2: Dual-rail environments where RTGS balances and tokenized reserves interoperate via synchronization layers.Stage 3: Full adoption of smart-contract-based policy tools, possibly including real-time fiscal transfers.Just as earlier shifts like the rollout of RTGS systems or inflation-targeting regimes were introduced gradually to test and refine their impact, tokenized systems will be phased in through pilots, sandboxes and hybrid models before full-scale adoption.Whether it ultimately reshapes how central banks manage the economy remains to be seen.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-central-banks-are-testing-blockchain-based-monetary-policy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave.However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation.This caused the long-term holder realized capitalization to surge past $28 billion, a level not seen since April. Realized cap is a measure of the value of each Bitcoin based on the last time it was moved, rather than the current market price.Long-term investors are using this period of forced selling to increase their exposure and accumulate more Bitcoin for the long run, Amr Taha noted. “This strategic accumulation during moments of market stress reflects the deep conviction of LTHs.”“Rather than being shaken out by short-term volatility, they [LTH] see these liquidation-driven dips as prime opportunities to strengthen their positions, reinforcing the foundation for future price appreciation.”BTC short-term holders (red) and long-term holders (green) net realized cap.

Gox, but said proof-of-reserves isn’t the correct measure to take for institutions.“No institutional-grade or enterprise security analyst would think it’s a good idea to publish all of the wallet addresses, such that you could be traced back and forth.”“Go to AI, put it in deep think mode and then ask it ‘what are the security problems of publishing your wallet addresses?’ and ‘how might it undermine the security of your company over time,” Saylor said, adding it would write “50 pages of security problems.”Proof-of-reserves increasingly adopted after FTX collapseMany crypto exchanges, custodians and exchange-traded fund issuers started publishing their proof-of-reserves following FTX’s collapse in November 2022 to establish transparency and prove that they hold enough assets to back customer deposits.Related: Strategy bags 4,020 Bitcoin as price briefly breaks $110KCrypto exchanges Binance, Kraken and OKX and crypto asset manager Bitwise are among the industry players that have adopted the transparency measure.However, Saylor noted that proof-of-reserves often only show one side of the picture — what the company holds — and not what they owe.Source: Mitchell AskewSaylor’s Strategy is the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 576,230 Bitcoin worth $62.6 million on its balance sheet, followed by Bitcoin mining firm MARA Holdings, which holds 48,137 Bitcoin, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET.More than 110 publicly traded companies worldwide have purchased and hold Bitcoin.Magazine: Danger signs for Bitcoin as retail abandons it to institutions: Sky Wee",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/michael-saylor-says-proof-of-reserves-bad-idea?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Since the world has infinite unpredictable possibilities, LeCun believes training must happen through abstraction, which mirrors how humans make sense of the physical world.Meta’s AI brain drain Meanwhile, Meta is experiencing significant talent loss from its AI research team, particularly among the researchers who created the original Llama model in 2023, Insider reported on May 26. Just three of the original 14 Llama authors remain at Meta, and many have joined Mistral, a Paris-based startup co-founded by former Meta researchers and key Llama architects. Meta’s latest release, Llama 4, received a lukewarm reception from developers, many of whom now look to faster-moving rivals that have dedicated reasoning models such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o, Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, and the recently launched Claude 4 Sonnet from Anthropic, the report added. On May 15, The Wall Street Journal reported that Meta was delaying the rollout of its flagship AI LLM, Llama 4 “Behemoth.” Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/meta-ai-boss-ai-lacks-intelligent-behavior-report?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

However, FOX5 New York reported that the man may already be in custody, citing conflicting sources.The New York Post reported that the man is the co-founder of a Swiss trading firm.Woeltz, known as the “crypto king of Kentucky,” is facing several charges, including kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment and assault. He allegedly held the victim at his apartment for 17 days.Woeltz’s assistant, Italian-born Beatrice Folchi, was also arrested, however, she was freed, and no charges have been laid against her.The arrests came after Teofrasto Carturan, aged 28 from Italy, managed to escape the apartment on May 23 — the day he had allegedly been told would be his “death day.”CNN reported that Teofrasto Carturan agreed to give up his crypto seed phrase, which was stored on his laptop in another room, and as he went to get his laptop, Woeltz turned his back, allowing him to bolt to the exit.Several New York news outlets shared videos of the victim running outside, barefoot, toward a traffic officer.Sometime after, police arrested Woeltz at his Soho apartment and took him into custody.He remains detained, and his next court date is set for May 28.Alleged victim shares ordealTeofrasto Carturan claimed to police that he arrived from Italy on May 6 and went to the Soho apartment to meet his “business partners.”Sometime later, he claimed his passport was token he was tortured to reveal his crypto seed phrase.

Antpool CEO Andy Chow said:\""Antpool has become the bridge operator for Bitlayer to support Bitcoin innovation and protect miners’ interests.”BitVM (Bitcoin Virtual Machine) is a framework that enables complex smart contracts to be deployed on the Bitcoin blockchain without changing the base protocol. The idea was introduced by Robin Linux in 2023, and allows for the complex computation involved in smart contract systems to be verified onchain and executed offchain in a way resembling optimistic rollups.Related: Here’s how Bitcoin is transforming into Web3’s backboneA BitVM implementationBitlayer is a BitVM implementation, aiming to allow Bitcoin to flow through decentralized finance (DeFi) systems and layer-2 networks. According to Chow, the implementation might lead to heightened activity in Bitcoin’s network and generate revenue for miners:“This expansion of Bitcoin’s use cases will drive more network activity, generating additional transaction fees and revenue opportunities for miners. As block rewards decrease over time, growing fee markets are critical for miners’ sustainable income.“Mining pools such as Chow’s Antpool play a critical role in the adoption of BitVM implementations because they directly determine the inclusion and validation of new types of transactions and scripts at the consensus layer.BitVM requires miners to include custom Taproot-based transactions that encode interactive verification logic. Mining pools must agree to include these non-standard or computationally intensive scripts in blocks, otherwise the protocol would simply not function.Related: StarkWare researchers propose smart contracts for Bitcoin with ColliderVMMining pool supportAccording to Hashrate Index data, Antpool controls 17.2% of Bitcoin’s hashrate as of May 26, while F2Pool controls 8.2% and Spiderpool 6.1%. This results in a total supporting hashrate of  31.5%.Bitcoin hashrate distribution between mining pools. Source: Hash Rate IndexThis is enough to secure transaction inclusion in under one in every three blocks. This is presumably enough for testing, prototyping and early-stage applications.With this percentage of supporting hashrate, developers can build functional systems with the assumption that, despite some latency, BitVM transactions will be processed. So while it is hard to view this hashrate as allowing a fully functional deployment, it is likely enough for the early phases of BitVM development.A Bitlayer representative told Cointelegraph that “should collective hashrate support weaken or policy shifts occur within Bitcoin Core, we have a multi-layered contingency plan.” This plan includes the “expanded mining pool partnerships,” referring to the company’s intention to keep onboarding more mining pools.Magazine: ZK-proofs are bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin — BitcoinOS and Starknet",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitlayer-secures-40-of-bitcoin-s-hashrate-to-bring-smart-contracts-to-btc?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

European stock markets responded positively to the development, but Bitcoin (BTC) was unable to hold the $110,000 level, leading traders to question whether a new all-time high remains within reach.Even if Bitcoin revisits the $105,000 mark, rising institutional interest and robust derivatives markets indicate that bullish traders are neither overleveraged nor concerned about a potential correction.Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized basis rate. Source: laevitas.chDemand for leveraged long Bitcoin positions grew, as evidenced by the BTC futures premium increasing to 8% on May 26. Although this was a modest rise from 6.5% the previous day, the metric still sits comfortably within the neutral range of 5% to 10%. For context, in December 2024, the Bitcoin futures premium surged to 20% when BTC surpassed $100,000 for the first time.Will Nvidia earnings and US economic data ignite Bitcoin price? President Trump’s decision to delay the EU import duties until July 9 reduced some market uncertainty, yet the broader economic consequences of the ongoing tariff conflict have yet to show up in corporate earnings. Investor risk appetite now hinges in part on Nvidia's (NVDA)  May 28 earnings report, and anticipation for this possibly explains Bitcoin’s inability to break through its previous highs.Bitcoin options markets are signaling an increased probability of upward movement.

The recent 5.1% drop in MBA Mortgage Applications for the week ending May 23 prompted traders to adopt a more cautious stance.While Bitcoin derivatives metrics remain healthy, upcoming economic data will be critical for market sentiment.
