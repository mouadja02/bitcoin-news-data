2025-05-28T09:50:39.000Z,"Square & Steak ‘n Shake Lead with Bitcoin Payments – Best Wallet to Add Crypto Debit Card","It turns out that Bitcoin ($BTC) isn’t just for the tech bros anymore but also for businesses, hamburger lovers, and everyday spenders — aka, everyone. Yesterday, Square, a payment platform by Block Inc., announced that it’ll soon enable businesses to accept $BTC and other crypto. In other news, the popular American fast-food chain Steak ‘n’ Shake started accepting $BTC for payments two weeks ago. And let’s not forget Best Wallet , a highly ranked secure crypto wallet that’ll soon launch its own crypto debit card. Each of these developments highlights how $BTC is rapidly evolving from a speculative investment instrument to a practical currency built for real-world commerce. Square Integrates Lightning for Low-Fee $BTC Payments Square’s new hardware feature will enable merchants to accept cost-friendly and near-instant $BTC payments using the Lightning Network. It began accepting $BTC payments at the Bitcoin Conference in Las Vegas (May 27 – 29). However, a full rollout is expected by the end of the year as part of its plan to reach all eligible sellers by 2026. This isn’t Square’s first $BTC rodeo. It launched a Bitcoin Conversions feature last year, allowing merchants to automatically convert a portion of their daily sales into $BTC. Additionally, its Cash App already lets you buy, sell, and send $BTC easily, and its self-custody crypto wallet, Bitkey Wallet, also supports the OG coin. It has also launched Proto, which consists of Bitcoin mining tools and services, and Spiral, which supports open-source projects that promote $BTC as a tool for economic empowerment. Stake ‘n’ Shake’s $BTC Payments Half Processing Fees Square isn’t the only one on a mission to put $BTC to work in the real world. Stake ‘n’ Shake now accepts $BTC payments, claiming they’re faster and cheaper than traditional credit card payments. Dan Edwards, the fast food chain’s COO, says the company saves approximately 50% in processing fees when customers pay with $BTC as opposed to credit cards. Following the new payment method’s early success, Stake ‘n’ Shake is now pondering other ways to embrace cutting-edge technology to modernize its food service. Ideas include cyber-chefs, robotaxis, and drones. Best Wallet to Add a Crypto Debit Card Best Wallet is also pushing to make crypto available for use in daily life, and will soon launch Best Card, its own crypto debit card. It’ll let anyone spend their crypto holdings in Best Wallet seamlessly at brick-and-mortar retailers. This multi-chain wallet supports the best crypto presales and is getting set to accommodate over 60 blockchains – you’ll find everything you need to know in our full Best Wallet review . Once launched, you can use your Best Card to spend $BTC and other digital assets for everyday purchases – from coffee to cab rides – without the friction of exchanges or conversions. What’s more, you can earn cashback on every purchase, plus enjoy lower transaction fees when holding $BEST , the ecosystem’s native token. You can buy #BEST on presale for just $0.025095. Our $BEST price prediction foresees the coin reaching $0.072 after being listed on crypto exchanges , an increase of some 186% from today’s price, so it’s best to get in now. $BTC Is No Longer a Store of Value But Everyday Cash $BTC is no longer just a store of value, but increasingly a payment method for everyday life. With Square enabling low-cost $BTC payments, Stake ‘n’ Shake slashing fees by accepting crypto at the counter, and Best Wallet preparing to launch a fully-fledged crypto card, the future is here. These developments highlight how $BTC is being integrated into real-world commerce to cut costs and give you more financial freedom. Whether for buying a burger or growing an investment portfolio, $BTC is going mainstream.

2025-05-28T09:46:59.000Z,"Altcoin Season Is Still Alive—Top Traders Say the Best Is Yet to Come","The post Altcoin Season Is Still Alive—Top Traders Say the Best Is Yet to Come appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News While Bitcoin continues to dominate the crypto market and break new records, altcoins seem to be quietly waiting in the shadows. But according to top crypto analysts, that wait might be almost over, and what’s coming next could feel like a massive wave for altcoins. The Calm Before the Altcoin Storm? When markets are quiet, emotions tend to take over. Many investors are starting to believe that the altcoin run is already over, or worse, that a bear market is around the corner. Meanwhile, seasoned crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe recently reminded investors that most altcoins are still trading near their bottom levels. That might sound negative at first, but here’s the twist, bottoms often come right before major rallies. I don't understand why people start claiming that a bear market is around the corner for #Altcoins . They are literally on the bottom. The BTC valuations have been declining massively. The money printer is about to get started. The final easy 12-24 months are coming. — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) May 27, 2025 Van de Poppe believes that the next 12 to 24 months could offer the “final easy” gains for altcoin holders before the market shifts again. Momentum Is Building, Quietly If you’ve been watching the charts, you’ll notice Bitcoin has been grabbing most of the attention, both in headlines and in market dominance. As of now, bitcoin dominance has hit its peak of 64%, which suggests that the turnaround is near. Meanwhile, popular altcoins like Solana, ADA, and XRP have shown some movement but are still trading well below their all-time high price. Solana, for example, has risen nearly 15% in the last 30 days, now sitting around $173. But zoom out a bit, and it’s still down more than 30% from highs seen just a few months ago. XRP tells a similar story, small short-term gains, but still far from previous highs. Traders Predict a Shift Despite the growing bitcoin dominance, Crypto experts like Davinci Jeremie and other analysts are backing van de Poppe’s outlook. They believe the tide is turning, and once it starts, altcoins could explode in value. Yet, many altcoins remain underperformers, and market sentiment hasn’t shifted fully. Currently, Altcoin Season Index sits at just 25 . To begin the altcoin season, at least 50 altcoins need to outperform BTC’s performance. But if these traders are right, altcoins might soon get their moment to shine, and it could happen faster than most expect.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/altcoin-season-is-still-alive-top-traders-say-the-best-is-yet-to-come/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

2025-05-28T09:40:44.000Z,"US spot Ethereum ETFs Surge with $38.8M Inflows","BitcoinWorld US spot Ethereum ETFs Surge with $38.8M Inflows The world of cryptocurrency investing just got a significant boost, particularly for those eyeing exposure to Ethereum. Recent data confirms a notable trend: US spot Ethereum ETFs are attracting substantial capital, signaling growing confidence and interest from investors. What’s Driving the Latest Ethereum ETF Inflows? According to figures released by Farside Investors, US spot Ethereum ETFs collectively experienced a net inflow of $38.8 million on May 27th. This single-day performance is part of a larger, encouraging pattern – it marked the seventh consecutive trading day where these newly approved investment products saw more money come in than go out. This consistent positive flow suggests a building momentum following the initial regulatory steps towards their launch. While the total figures are still modest compared to the early days of Bitcoin spot ETFs, the trend itself is highly significant. Breaking Down the ETH ETF Performance While the total figure tells one story, looking at individual fund performance provides more detail on where the money is heading. On May 27th: BlackRock’s ETHA led the charge, pulling in a substantial $32.5 million in net inflows. As one of the world’s largest asset managers, BlackRock’s participation and early success in attracting funds are particularly noteworthy. Fidelity’s FETH followed, adding $3.4 million to its holdings. Fidelity is another major player whose involvement lends considerable credibility to the space. VanEck’s ETHV saw $2.9 million in net inflows, demonstrating interest beyond just the two largest funds. Other approved ETFs reported no change in their holdings on that specific day, which is not uncommon in the early stages of such products. This distribution highlights that while multiple issuers have received approval, initial investor capital appears to be concentrating in funds offered by established financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity. Why Are These Inflows Important for the Crypto ETF Market? The emergence and subsequent performance of US spot Ethereum ETFs represent a critical evolution in the broader Crypto ETF market . For years, investors seeking direct exposure to cryptocurrencies faced hurdles, including setting up crypto exchange accounts, managing private keys, and navigating varying regulatory landscapes. Spot ETFs change this. They offer a regulated, familiar investment vehicle that allows investors, particularly institutional ones, to gain exposure to the price movements of Ethereum without directly holding the underlying asset. This significantly lowers the barrier to entry for traditional finance participants. The positive inflows, even if not yet in the billions seen by Bitcoin ETFs, validate the market’s appetite for these products and pave the way for potentially larger capital allocations in the future once trading officially commences. What Does This Mean for Institutional Crypto Adoption? The consistent inflows into ETH ETF products are a strong indicator of growing Institutional crypto adoption . Large firms, wealth managers, and institutional investors typically prefer regulated products like ETFs over direct crypto ownership due to compliance requirements, ease of management, and integration into existing financial systems. BlackRock and Fidelity attracting the bulk of early inflows underscores this point. These are firms catering to massive pools of institutional and high-net-worth capital. Their clients now have a straightforward way to add Ethereum exposure to diversified portfolios. While retail investors will also benefit from the accessibility, the primary significance of spot crypto ETFs often lies in unlocking institutional demand, which has the potential to bring substantial liquidity and stability to the market over time. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for US Spot Ethereum ETFs? While the approval of US spot Ethereum ETFs was a major milestone, the next crucial step is the commencement of trading. This requires approval of the S-1 registration statements from the SEC. The timing of this remains uncertain, though many analysts anticipate it could happen in the coming weeks or months. Once trading begins, the market will be watching closely to see if the positive inflow trend continues and accelerates. Factors that could influence future inflows include: Overall market sentiment for cryptocurrencies. Ethereum’s price performance. The success of the ETFs in attracting both retail and institutional capital. Further regulatory clarity or developments. The current streak of inflows, even pre-trading, suggests a pent-up demand that is starting to materialize. This bodes well for the potential impact these products could have on the Ethereum ecosystem and the broader digital asset investment landscape. In Summary The recent data showing US spot Ethereum ETFs attracting $38.8 million in net inflows on May 27th, extending a streak to seven consecutive days, is a positive development for the crypto market. Led by significant contributions from BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck, these inflows highlight growing interest and anticipation ahead of official trading commencement. This trend is a key indicator of increasing Institutional crypto adoption and represents a significant step forward for the Crypto ETF market , offering regulated access to Ethereum. As we await the final regulatory green light for trading, the sustained positive flow into these ETH ETF products signals a promising future for mainstream investment in Ethereum.

2025-05-28T09:39:16.000Z,"Loan at Risk as IMF Presses El Salvador on Bitcoin Buys","While the IMF insists that the government should stop using its Chivo wallet and freeze further Bitcoin acquisitions, President Nayib Bukele’s administration continues to defy these conditions. In fact, El Salvador bought 30 more BTC in May alone. Analysts speculate El Salvador could still comply with IMF terms by routing purchases through third parties. Meanwhile, Japanese firm Metaplanet is escalating its own Bitcoin strategy by raising $50 million via zero-interest bonds backed by Evo Fund to increase its holdings beyond 7,800 BTC. However, critics argue that investors are overvaluing firms like Metaplanet and Strategy, and suggest that direct Bitcoin purchases offer better value. Adding to Bitcoin’s mainstream momentum, Jack Dorsey's Block Inc. announced it will roll out Bitcoin payments via Square by 2026 using the Lightning Network, promising speed, lower fees, and greater merchant flexibility. El Salvador Under IMF Scrutiny The International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced on May 27 that it reached a staff-level agreement to disburse $120 million to El Salvador, contingent upon executive board approval. This payout follows an initial review of the $1.4 billion, 40-month loan agreement that was signed last year. However, the disbursement comes with certain conditions—particularly regarding El Salvador’s continued involvement with Bitcoin. The IMF explained that the government must cease operations related to the Chivo wallet by the end of July and must ensure that the amount of Bitcoin held across all government-owned wallets remains unchanged. Despite these terms, El Salvador appears to be maintaining its pro-Bitcoin stance . Just hours after the IMF announcement, the country's Bitcoin Office posted on X that it had once again to its Bitcoin holdings. According to the official Bitcoin tracker , El Salvador acquired 30 BTC over the past 30 days, bringing its national Bitcoin reserve to 6,190.18 BTC. This persistent acquisition strategy is in line with President Nayib Bukele’s ongoing plan to purchase one Bitcoin per day . The IMF reiterated earlier in March that El Salvador should halt Bitcoin accumulation and avoid launching new Bitcoin-related initiatives. Yet Bukele’s administration remains firm, and recently announced that the country's Bitcoin holdings are now at an unrealized profit of $386 million. This is a gain of 132% on the total investment. (Source: BitBo ) While the IMF continues to call for restraint, some analysts, including intergovernmental blockchain adviser Anndy Lian,proposed that El Salvador may still technically comply with IMF conditions by routing purchases through non-governmental entities. Meanwhile, IMF officials acknowledged that the country is currently in compliance with broader performance criteria, which only complicates the enforcement of Bitcoin-related conditions. Metaplanet Ramps Up Bitcoin Holdings El Salvador is not alone in its BItcoin accumulation mission. Japanese investment firm Metaplanet announced a $50 million private placement of zero-interest bonds to help expand its Bitcoin holdings. The May 28 announcement revealed that the bonds, issued in $1.25 million increments, will not offer investors any periodic interest payments. Instead, profits—if any—will be realized solely through the bond’s redemption value at maturity. Part of Metaplanet’s announcement The sole investor in this round is Evo Fund, a Cayman Islands-based investment firm that served as Metaplanet’s principal backer in its Bitcoin acquisition initiatives. Evo Fund consistently subscribed to previous rounds of Metaplanet’s zero-interest bonds and continues to support the firm’s crypto-focused capital deployment. The new bonds are unsecured and come with no guarantees or collateral, which implies that the level of trust between the two entities is quite impressive. Despite the size of the issuance, Metaplanet stated that the bonds are expected to have minimal impact on its 2025 financial results, though the company promised to disclose any relevant updates in the future. The decision to raise capital through this unconventional bond structure is part of a trend among firms seeking alternatives to fiat-based treasury strategies. Metaplanet's move also follows its second-largest Bitcoin purchase to date, where it acquired 1,004 BTC worth over $100 million, bringing its total holdings to 7,800 BTC valued at more than $800 million. Metaplanet Bitcoin holdings (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.net ) The company’s aggressive accumulation strategy has greatly affected its market valuation. According to a report by 10x Research on May 27, Metaplanet’s stock is trading as if its Bitcoin holdings were worth five times their actual value. This fueled criticism from some financial circles, including veteran investor Jim Chanos , who argued at the Sohn Investment Conference in New York that investors are overpaying for Bitcoin exposure through companies like Metaplanet and Strategy. Chanos revealed that he is selling shares in these firms to buy Bitcoin directly, which suggests that direct exposure offers more accurate value and potentially higher returns than relying on corporate wrappers. Square to Roll Out Bitcoin Payments by 2026 In other Bitcoin-related news, Jack Dorsey’s Block, Inc. is set to bring Bitcoin payments to Square, its popular merchant payment platform. The company unveiled the plan during the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on May 27, and showcased the feature at the BTC Inc. merchandise booth. Bitcoin payments will be facilitated using the Lightning Network, allowing for fast and low-cost transactions. The rollout is scheduled to begin in the second half of 2025, with full availability for all eligible Square sellers expected by 2026, pending regulatory clearance. The new feature will allow merchants to accept Bitcoin payments using existing Square hardware, with the option to either hold the received BTC or have it automatically converted into fiat currency in real-time. Jack Dorsey shared the update on X , and specifically pointed out the flexibility this offers to merchants. This initiative builds on Square’s current Bitcoin Conversions feature, which lets sellers convert a portion of their earnings into Bitcoin. According to Miles Suter, Block’s Bitcoin Product Lead, the goal is to give merchants more choice and economic empowerment when it comes to accepting payments. He described the integration as seamless for consumers, with payments made by simply scanning a QR code while Square and the Lightning Network handle the backend processing. In tandem with the Square announcement, Block revealed it is also enhancing the privacy and security of its Bitkey self-custody wallet. Bitkey launched in late 2023, and is receiving updates to improve accessibility and eliminate the need for traditional seed phrases, making self-custody much more user-friendly for the broader public. The benefits of Bitcoin payments were also pointed out by Dan Edwards, COO of the American fast food chain Stake n’ Shake . At the conference, Edwards said the company halved its payment processing fees since adopting Bitcoin as it it is faster than credit cards and significantly cheaper.

2025-05-28T09:20:52.000Z,"North Korea’s Lazarus Group steals over $5.2M from a crypto trader","North Korea’s Lazarus Group has been linked to a cyberattack that stole more than $5.2 million from a crypto trader on May 24, according to blockchain investigator ZackXBT. The theft occurred through a sophisticated malware attack, with funds siphoned from several wallet types including multisig, externally owned accounts (EOAs), and exchange wallets. The incident, revealed on ZackXBT’s Telegram channel on Tuesday, insinuated that the group could be changing their focus from high-net-worth individuals and companies to intraday individual traders. After the heist, approximately 1,000 ETH was funneled into Tornado Cash, a crypto-mixing service commonly used to obscure the origin of stolen digital assets. The stolen assets were then promptly liquidated on the open market. Addresses traced, Tornado Cash used to launder funds ZachXBT’s channel listed three Ethereum addresses tied to the heist. Along with minor token balances of QBX, Blocklords, Astra Protocol, and DAI totaling around $1,340, the principal address had more than 40 ETH, which is around $107,000 at current market values. It is thought that these funds were part of the malware attack’s profits. Last weekend, just nine transactions were processed using the second address, which seemed to be new. It sent more than 200 ETH to the main address. Finally, as of this publication, the other crypto address held around $2.7 million DAI, which was the majority of the stolen funds. This pattern of conduct is consistent with what was found in a recent study by TRM Labs, which details the worldwide web of Russian criminal organizations and Chinese over-the-counter brokers that North Korea uses to launder its illegal profits. The report alleges that Lazarus supplies the technical expertise, but their partners provide the channels to integrate stolen funds into markets legitimately. Money laundering continues in Q2 2025 In April, blockchain analytics firm SpotOnChain reported that a wallet believed to be associated with Lazarus offloaded 40.78 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) for $3.51 million. The Bitcoin, originally purchased in February 2023 for about $999,900 when WBTC traded at $24,521, was sold at $83,459 per coin for a profit of 251% over two years. Today, the Lazarus Group (North Korean hackers) sold 40.78 $WBTC ($3.51M) for a $2.51M profit (+251%)—after buying it 2 years ago. They spent 999.9K $USDT to acquire the $WBTC at ~$24,521 in Feb 2023, and sold it for 1,857 $ETH at ~$86,170 just 12 hours ago. The hackers then… pic.twitter.com/KYQmqnJnIC — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) April 3, 2025 The proceeds were converted into 1,847 ETH and later split among three wallets. The largest tranche of 1,865 ETH was traced to another wallet reportedly operated by the group. Instead of holding the converted ETH, Lazarus distributed 2,507 ETH across multiple addresses. DPRK-linked hackers were also connected to the infamous $1.5 billion hack on the Bybit crypto exchange. In the aftermath of the breach, the group allegedly laundered nearly 500,000 ETH, equivalent to about $1.39 billion, across multiple transactions within just ten days. 黑客已经把从 Bybit 盗取的 49.9 万枚 ETH ($13.9 亿) 全部清洗完了，整个过程历时 10 天。 ETH 价格在这个过程中下跌了 23% (从 $2,780 跌到现在的 $2,130)。 而黑客洗钱使用的主要通道 THORChain 也因黑客洗钱获得了 $59 亿的交易量跟 $550 万的手续费收入。 本文由 #Bitget ｜ @Bitget_zh 赞助 https://t.co/osoKNzFhkG pic.twitter.com/QUWuMmV6zH — 余烬 (@EmberCN) March 4, 2025 At least $605 million was funneled through the decentralized liquidity protocol THORChain in a single day. Yet, blockchain intelligence platform Arkham Intelligence estimates that wallets tied to Lazarus still hold approximately $1.1 billion in crypto reserves, including significant holdings in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether. Cybercrime funding nuclear ambitions United Nations investigators monitoring sanctions compliance believe that the proceeds from these cyberattacks are being funneled into North Korea’s weapons development programs. Between 2017 and 2023, the country reportedly used crypto-based revenue streams to improve its missile technology, increasing its capacity to strike targets far beyond the Korean peninsula.

2025-05-28T09:20:33.000Z,"Bitcoin Mining Takes a Giant Leap: Bitmain Launches Antminer S23 Hydro","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Mining Takes a Giant Leap: Bitmain Launches Antminer S23 Hydro The world of Bitcoin mining is constantly evolving, pushing the boundaries of efficiency and performance. At the forefront of this innovation is Bitmain, the industry giant renowned for its Antminer series. Their latest reveal is set to make waves, quite literally, in the mining landscape: the Antminer S23 Hydro series. What is the Antminer S23 Hydro and Why Does it Matter for Bitcoin Mining ? Bitmain’s announcement of the Antminer S23 Hydro series at the World Digital Mining Summit (WDMS) 2025, as reported by Wu Blockchain on X, marks a significant milestone. This new generation of mining hardware is designed for large-scale operations, leveraging advanced hydro cooling technology to achieve performance levels previously unseen in their product line. Why is this important for Bitcoin mining ? Higher efficiency and hashrate mean miners can potentially mine more Bitcoin for the same or less energy cost (per terahash). This directly impacts profitability and the overall economics of the mining industry. As the Bitcoin network’s difficulty increases, more powerful and efficient machines like the S23 Hydro are crucial for staying competitive. Exploring the Specs: How Does the Antminer S23 Hydro Stack Up? Let’s dive into the technical specifications that make the Antminer S23 Hydro a powerhouse: Hashrate: Up to 580 TH/s (Terahashes per second). This is a substantial increase compared to previous generations, allowing miners to contribute significantly more processing power to the network. Energy Efficiency: A remarkable 9.5 J/TH (Joules per Terahash). Energy efficiency is perhaps the most critical metric for miners, directly impacting operational costs. A lower J/TH means less electricity is consumed per unit of hashing power. This 9.5 J/TH figure places the S23 Hydro among the most efficient machines currently available. Power Consumption: Consumes 5,510 watts of power. While the total power draw is high, it’s the efficiency relative to the hashrate that truly matters. To put this into perspective, let’s consider a simplified comparison (specific models and conditions vary): Model Cooling Max Hashrate Efficiency (J/TH) Approx. Power (W) Antminer S19j Pro Air ~100 TH/s ~29.5 J/TH ~2950 W Antminer S19 XP Hydro Hydro ~255 TH/s ~20.8 J/TH ~5304 W Antminer S23 Hydro Hydro ~580 TH/s ~9.5 J/TH ~5510 W As you can see, the S23 Hydro offers a massive leap in hashrate and a dramatic improvement in efficiency compared to earlier models, even within Bitmain’s hydro-cooled lineup. This makes it a highly attractive piece of crypto mining hardware for operations focused on optimizing their energy expenditure. The Power of Water: Understanding Hydro Cooling Mining Unlike traditional air-cooled miners that rely on fans to dissipate heat, the Antminer S23 Hydro utilizes liquid cooling. Here’s a quick look at how it works and its advantages: How it Works: A liquid coolant (often a mixture of water and glycol) is circulated through plates or channels in direct contact with the heat-generating components (the ASIC chips). This heated liquid is then pumped to a heat exchanger (like a radiator) where the heat is transferred to the air or another cooling medium, and the cooled liquid returns to the miner. Superior Heat Dissipation: Liquid is far more effective at absorbing and transferring heat than air. This allows the chips to run cooler, potentially increasing their lifespan and stability, and enabling higher performance. Increased Density: Hydro cooling allows miners to be packed much more closely together in a facility. Without the need for large air gaps between units and powerful fans, mining containers or buildings can house significantly more hashing power in the same footprint. Noise Reduction: Hydro-cooled systems are significantly quieter than air-cooled ones, which rely on numerous high-speed fans. This is a major benefit for large mining farms located near populated areas. Improved Efficiency: While the cooling system itself consumes power, the overall efficiency gain from the chips running optimally at higher clock speeds and the reduced need for massive air handling infrastructure often results in a lower overall J/TH compared to air-cooled setups at similar performance levels. Implementing hydro cooling mining requires specialized infrastructure, including pumps, piping, radiators, and a reliable water source or closed-loop system, which represents a significant upfront investment. Is the Antminer S23 Hydro Right for Your Farm? Actionable Insights for the Bitcoin Miner The Antminer S23 Hydro is not designed for the casual home Bitcoin miner . Its power consumption, cooling requirements, and likely price point make it suitable primarily for large-scale, professional mining operations. If you are considering upgrading or building a new facility, here are some actionable insights: Evaluate Infrastructure Costs: The capital expenditure for a hydro-cooled facility is much higher than for air-cooled. Factor in the cost of the cooling system, plumbing, and specialized racks. Assess Power Availability and Cost: With a 5.5 kW draw per unit, you need substantial, reliable, and affordable electricity. The S23 Hydro’s efficiency shines brightest where power costs are low. Consider Maintenance: Hydro systems require different maintenance expertise than air-cooled systems. Ensure you have the technical staff capable of managing liquid cooling infrastructure. Calculate ROI: Perform a detailed return on investment calculation based on the S23 Hydro’s price (when announced), your electricity cost, the current Bitcoin price, and the network difficulty growth projections. Its high efficiency offers potential for faster ROI, but the initial cost is key. Facility Location: Locations with access to natural cooling sources (like cold climates or nearby water bodies, used responsibly and legally) can further enhance the efficiency of hydro cooling. For large farms looking to maximize density and efficiency, the Antminer S23 Hydro represents a compelling option, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in professional Bitcoin mining . The Future of Crypto Mining Hardware The launch of the Antminer S23 Hydro series underscores a clear trend in the crypto mining hardware market: a move towards higher efficiency and liquid cooling solutions for large-scale operations. As Bitcoin’s halving events reduce block rewards, miners must become increasingly efficient to remain profitable. This drives manufacturers like Bitmain to innovate constantly. We can expect to see continued advancements in ASIC chip design, further reducing energy consumption per terahash. Liquid cooling, including single-phase and two-phase immersion cooling, is also likely to become more prevalent in professional setups due to its density and efficiency benefits. The competition among hardware manufacturers will likely intensify, leading to even more powerful and efficient machines in the future. In conclusion, Bitmain’s Antminer S23 Hydro series is a significant leap forward for Bitcoin mining technology. With its industry-leading efficiency and immense hashrate, it sets a new standard for high-performance crypto mining hardware . While requiring specialized infrastructure, its potential for increased profitability and operational density makes it a key development for large-scale miners navigating the increasingly competitive landscape. The trend towards more efficient, hydro-cooled solutions highlights the continuous innovation driving the future of digital asset mining.

2025-05-28T09:15:59.000Z,"$345,000,000,000 Asset Manager Urges US To Get House in Order, Warns Debt Now Increasing Faster Than Economic Growth","Jim Millstein, the Guggenheim Securities co-chair, is calling on the United States government to get its financial house in order, warning of a “fiscal disaster.” In a new interview with Bloomberg, Millstein says that government spending is by far outpacing revenues, creating an unsustainable financial situation. “We’re running a 7% of GDP deficit this year, which means that debt is increasing by 7% a year, whereas the economy has only been growing at 2% to 3% a year. So we are basically becoming more indebted over time, because the growth of the economy is not outpacing the growth of the debt. So there’s a massive need for what we call in the trade fiscal consolidation. We need to get our house in order and create revenues closer to spending.” In a separate Bloomberg interview, Millstein says that the US’s fiscal situation is concerning investors, which is why long-term Treasury yields have been rising lately. Millstein says the ten-year Treasury yields are increasing “because of the imbalance in the federal government’s finances and the huge amount of deficits they have to finance.” He also says there’s going to be “a huge supply of Treasuries coming to the market.” According to Millstein, the rising ten-year yields are the US’s largest financial challenge at the moment, as they increase the interest costs of existing and future debt. Millstein says the US may be facing a similar situation that occurred in the 1990s when bond yields rose enough to convince politicians to take action to lower the deficit.

There’s an evident lack of volatility from most altcoins as well, aside from SUI, which has surged by 6%, and XMR, which has dumped hard. BTC Calms at $109K Bitcoin reminded of its bull season last week when it finally broke above $109,000 (the January 2025 all-time high) and set a fresh peak of almost $110,000. That was last Wednesday, but it was not the only record set that week. After a violent but brief retracement, BTC went on the run once again and flew to almost $112,000 on Thursday – the Bitcoin Pizza Day – which became its latest peak . It stood close to that level on Friday before US President Trump recommended a new set of tariffs against the EU. This has a dramatic and immediate impact on BTC’s price, which tumbled by over three grand in minutes. Nevertheless, the bulls intervened and didn’t allow another nosedive. Just the opposite, bitcoin started to climb after the quiet weekend and jumped to $110,500 on Monday. It dropped back down to $107,500 before it aimed at $111,000 yesterday. It didn’t see any success there and is back to $109,000 as of now. Its market cap has declined slightly to $2.165 trillion on CG, and its dominance over the alts is just shy of 61%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView XMR Slumps The most volatile cryptocurrencies from the top 100 largest ones today are XMR and QNT. They stand on the opposite sides, though, as Monero has slumped by almost 12% to trade below $350. In contrast, QNT has gained 11% and sits close to $120. SUI is another notable gainer after some promising news on the Cetus hack front. The asset is up by 6% and trades above $3.7. In contrast, most other larger-cap alts, such as SOL, DOGE, ADA, XRP, TRX, HYPE, SHIB, and others, are slightly in the red. ETH and BNB have marked insignificant gains.

2025-05-28T09:12:00.000Z,"$11 trillion BlackRock recommends this much Bitcoin in your portfolio","At the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, BlackRock’s Head of Digital Assets, Robert Mitchnick, reaffirmed the asset management giant’s recommendation that wealth managers allocate 1–2% of client portfolios to Bitcoin , a guidance that originated from BlackRock’s internal model portfolios published in December 2024. For context, BlackRock isn’t a niche crypto fund. It’s the largest asset manager in the world, with more than $11 trillion in assets under management. So when it nudges financial advisers toward even a modest BTC allocation, the signal is hard to ignore. Mitchnick explained the rationale behind the allocation, noting it’s the product of years of research, not a reaction to short-term price action. “That was not a sudden reaction to any one thing. That was the result of multiple years of analysis and research by that team, who runs those portfolios,” he said . The original December report highlighted Bitcoin’s potential to serve as a global monetary alternative and a macro hedge, particularly in regimes marked by currency debasement, geopolitical friction, or unconventional monetary policy. BlackRock sees Bitcoin as an alternative Speaking on the adoption of that guidance three months later, Mitchnick emphasized how BlackRock’s model portfolios function as infrastructure for financial advisers looking to build diversified, risk-aware portfolios for retail and high-net-worth clients. “Model portfolios have become very powerful tools to help FAs do that,” he noted. “At BlackRock, we have a very big asset base in the model portfolios that we build and equip our wealth adviser clients with. One of those portfolios, as you note in February this year, added Bitcoin as an allocation in the 1–2% range—a model portfolio that includes alternatives in it.” The key phrase is alternatives . Bitcoin, in this context, is not being viewed as a high-beta tech bet or a speculative punt. It’s being positioned alongside other non-correlated assets that can improve risk-adjusted returns over time. “The investment thesis behind that is the view of Bitcoin as a global monetary alternative that is attractive in a lot of states of the world,” he added. BlackRock’s framing suggests Bitcoin is beginning to mature into the same institutional toolkit as commodities, private equity, or infrastructure.

2025-05-28T09:10:30.000Z,"BlackRock Bitcoin: Unlock Potential with a 2% Portfolio Allocation Recommendation","BitcoinWorld BlackRock Bitcoin: Unlock Potential with a 2% Portfolio Allocation Recommendation In the ever-evolving landscape of finance, few endorsements carry as much weight as those from global giants like BlackRock. So, when a key executive from the world’s largest asset manager speaks about cryptocurrency, the investment community listens intently. This is precisely what happened when Robert Mitchnick, Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, recently shared his insights regarding Bitcoin allocation at the Bitcoin 2025 conference. According to a report by Crypto Rover on X, Mitchnick put forward a compelling recommendation: consider allocating a modest yet significant 2% of your investment portfolio allocation to BlackRock Bitcoin products or direct exposure. This isn’t just a casual remark; it stems from a considered view, particularly highlighting Bitcoin’s potential role as a safe haven asset in uncertain economic times. But what does this recommendation truly mean for investors, both seasoned and new to the world of digital assets? Let’s dive deep into the implications, benefits, challenges, and actionable steps related to this potentially transformative crypto investment strategy. Why a BlackRock Recommendation Matters for Your Portfolio Allocation BlackRock manages trillions of dollars in assets for institutions and individuals worldwide. Their move into the Bitcoin space, particularly with the launch of their spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), signaled a major shift in institutional acceptance of cryptocurrency. Robert Mitchnick’s role at the helm of their digital assets division places him at the forefront of this institutional charge into crypto. Therefore, his recommendation for a specific percentage portfolio allocation to Bitcoin isn’t just an opinion; it’s a view informed by extensive market analysis, risk assessment, and a deep understanding of institutional investment strategies. Historically, traditional finance institutions were wary, if not outright dismissive, of Bitcoin. BlackRock’s active participation, coupled with a specific allocation recommendation from a senior executive, legitimizes Bitcoin as a serious asset class worthy of consideration within a diversified portfolio. It moves Bitcoin from the fringes of speculative trading into the realm of strategic asset management, aligning it with traditional assets like stocks, bonds, and commodities. This shift in perception, driven by major players like BlackRock, is crucial for broader adoption and investor confidence. Understanding the 2% Bitcoin Allocation Strategy A 2% allocation might sound small in the context of a large portfolio, but it’s a percentage often used by financial advisors for alternative or high-growth potential assets. It represents a balance: large enough to potentially impact overall portfolio returns if Bitcoin performs well, but small enough that a significant downturn in Bitcoin wouldn’t catastrophically damage the entire portfolio. This risk management aspect is key to understanding the rationale behind such a recommendation, especially when considering the volatility inherent in crypto investment . Think of portfolio allocation like building a sturdy house. You need a strong foundation (stable assets), solid walls (growth assets), and perhaps some unique architectural features (alternative assets like Bitcoin) that can add value and character, but aren’t so dominant that their failure brings down the whole structure. A 2% Bitcoin allocation fits into this ‘alternative feature’ category, offering exposure to a potentially high-reward asset without overexposing the portfolio to its unique risks. This specific percentage isn’t arbitrary. It likely comes from sophisticated modeling that considers factors like historical Bitcoin volatility, correlation with traditional assets, and potential upside scenarios. For many investors, particularly those new to crypto, starting with a small, defined allocation like 2% provides a manageable entry point to gain exposure and become comfortable with the asset class without betting the farm. Is Bitcoin Truly a Safe Haven Asset? Exploring the Argument Mitchnick’s mention of Bitcoin as a safe haven asset is perhaps the most intriguing part of his recommendation. Traditionally, assets considered ‘safe havens’ are those expected to retain or increase in value during times of market turbulence, economic uncertainty, or geopolitical stress. Gold has long been the classic example, often referred to as a store of value that holds up when fiat currencies or stock markets falter. The argument for Bitcoin as a safe haven rests on several pillars: Decentralization: Bitcoin operates outside the control of any single government or central bank. This makes it potentially resilient to the inflationary policies or economic instability of any one nation. Scarcity: The total supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million coins, making it a deflationary asset by design, unlike fiat currencies which can be printed infinitely. This scarcity can make it attractive during periods of high inflation. Portability and Divisibility: Bitcoin can be easily stored, transferred, and divided, offering advantages over physical assets like gold. Global Accessibility: It can be accessed and used anywhere in the world with internet access, providing an alternative store of value for people in countries experiencing currency crises or political instability. However, the concept of Bitcoin as a safe haven is still debated. Critics point to its high volatility, which makes it seem counterintuitive to label it as ‘safe’. Its price can fluctuate wildly based on market sentiment, regulatory news, and macroeconomic factors, sometimes behaving more like a risk-on growth asset than a traditional safe haven . Its relatively short history compared to gold also means it hasn’t been tested across multiple full economic cycles as a store of value. Perhaps a more nuanced view is that Bitcoin is an *emerging* or *digital* safe haven, offering different properties than traditional ones. Its lack of correlation with traditional assets (though this correlation can change over time) could make it a valuable diversifier, providing protection against risks specific to traditional financial systems. Mitchnick’s perspective, coming from BlackRock, suggests that large institutions are increasingly considering this potential, even if the traditional definition of a safe haven doesn’t perfectly fit Bitcoin’s current market behavior. Beyond the Safe Haven: Other Reasons for Bitcoin Allocation While the safe haven narrative is compelling, it’s not the only reason investors might consider a Bitcoin allocation . Other factors contributing to its appeal include: Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has shown tremendous long-term growth potential since its inception. Proponents believe that increasing adoption, network effects, and its fixed supply could drive significant future price appreciation. Diversification: As mentioned, Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional assets can be low, offering diversification benefits that can potentially reduce overall portfolio risk and improve risk-adjusted returns. Inflation Hedge: Its fixed supply makes it an attractive hedge against inflation, particularly relevant in an era of significant government spending and monetary expansion. Technological Innovation: Investing in Bitcoin is also, in part, an investment in the underlying blockchain technology, which has potential applications far beyond currency. Institutional Adoption: The increasing interest and investment from major financial institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and others is seen as a validation of the asset class and a potential catalyst for future price increases. Considering these factors alongside the potential safe haven properties paints a fuller picture of why a Bitcoin allocation is gaining traction among serious investors and institutions. Challenges and Risks of Crypto Investment It’s crucial to approach any crypto investment with eyes wide open to the inherent challenges and risks. While a 2% Bitcoin allocation is designed to be manageable, it doesn’t eliminate risk entirely. Key considerations include: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience rapid and significant swings, both up and down. Investors must be prepared for this volatility and avoid investing funds they cannot afford to lose. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still developing globally. New regulations could impact Bitcoin’s price, usability, and legality. Security Risks: Holding Bitcoin requires careful attention to security. Private keys must be protected from theft or loss. While ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT mitigate some of these risks by handling custody, direct ownership carries significant personal responsibility. Market Manipulation: The crypto market is still relatively smaller and less regulated than traditional markets, potentially making it more susceptible to manipulation. Technological Risks: While the Bitcoin protocol has proven robust, potential risks like quantum computing threats (long-term), software bugs, or network congestion exist, albeit considered low probability by many experts. Understanding and accepting these risks is paramount before making any crypto investment , including a Bitcoin allocation suggested by institutions like BlackRock. How to Approach a 2% Bitcoin Allocation: Actionable Insights If you’re considering incorporating a 2% Bitcoin allocation into your portfolio, here are some actionable steps and considerations: Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Even a small allocation to a volatile asset requires comfort with potential losses on that portion of your portfolio. Determine Your Investment Vehicle: You can gain exposure through various means: Spot Bitcoin ETFs (like BlackRock’s IBIT): Offers easy access through traditional brokerage accounts, professional management, and regulated custody. This is likely what Mitchnick’s recommendation points towards for many investors. Bitcoin Futures ETFs: Track futures contracts, which can behave differently than the spot price. Direct Ownership: Buying Bitcoin on an exchange and storing it yourself (in a hardware or software wallet). This gives you direct control but requires significant technical and security responsibility. Stocks of Crypto-Related Companies: Investing in companies that hold significant Bitcoin (like MicroStrategy) or are involved in the crypto industry (like exchanges or mining companies). This provides indirect exposure. Calculate 2% of Your Portfolio: Determine the exact dollar amount this represents based on your total investable assets. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing the entire 2% lump sum at once, consider investing smaller amounts regularly over time. This can help mitigate the risk of buying at a market peak due to Bitcoin’s volatility. Rebalance Periodically: If your Bitcoin allocation grows significantly due to price appreciation, it might exceed the initial 2%. Consider rebalancing by selling some Bitcoin to bring it back to your target allocation, or conversely, buying more if its value drops significantly. Stay Informed: The crypto market moves fast. Keep up with news, regulatory developments, and technological advancements. Consult a Financial Advisor: A qualified financial advisor can help you determine if a Bitcoin allocation is suitable for your specific financial situation, goals, and risk profile, integrating it within your broader portfolio allocation strategy. Remember that a recommendation from an executive, even from BlackRock, is not financial advice tailored to your personal circumstances. It’s a high-level strategic view from the perspective of large-scale asset management. The Broader Impact of Institutional Interest on Crypto Investment The fact that a senior BlackRock executive is publicly discussing specific Bitcoin allocation percentages underscores the profound shift happening in the financial world. Institutional acceptance brings several potential benefits to the crypto investment space: Increased Liquidity: Larger players bring more capital, increasing market depth and potentially reducing volatility over the long term (though short-term volatility remains). Enhanced Legitimacy: Institutional participation validates Bitcoin as a serious asset class, potentially attracting more retail and institutional investors. Improved Infrastructure: As institutions enter the space, they demand and help build more robust, secure, and regulated infrastructure for trading, custody, and management of digital assets. Greater Accessibility: Products like spot Bitcoin ETFs make it easier for traditional investors to gain exposure without navigating the complexities of crypto exchanges and private key management. While the path won’t be without bumps, the trend of increasing institutional engagement, highlighted by recommendations like the 2% Bitcoin allocation from BlackRock, suggests a future where digital assets play a more integrated role in global financial portfolios. Conclusion: Navigating Your Crypto Investment Journey Robert Mitchnick’s recommendation of a 2% portfolio allocation to BlackRock Bitcoin products or direct exposure is a significant data point for anyone considering crypto investment . It signals that even within the world’s largest financial institutions, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed not just as a speculative gamble, but as a legitimate asset class with potential roles as a growth driver, a diversifier, and even a digital safe haven . While the 2% figure provides a concrete starting point suggested by a major player, the decision to invest in Bitcoin, and how much to allocate, remains a personal one. It requires careful consideration of your own financial goals, risk tolerance, and understanding of the asset’s unique characteristics and risks. The increasing ease of access through products like ETFs, championed by firms like BlackRock, lowers the barrier to entry, but the fundamental principles of sound investing still apply: do your research, understand what you’re investing in, and only invest what you can afford to lose. The conversation around BlackRock Bitcoin and optimal Bitcoin allocation is just beginning, marking an exciting time for the intersection of traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets.

He believes the shift is already underway, and that the future will belong to tokenized, single-person companies. Speaking at the Bitcoin Conference 2025 in Las Vegas on Tuesday, Tenev said the next generation of entrepreneurs will rely on AI to create value with minimal human involvement. Tenev drew parallels to Satoshi Nakamoto, the elusive creator of Bitcoin , who famously introduced the digital currency in 2008 and then vanished, leaving behind a decentralized project now worth over $1 trillion. “That’s Bitcoin, in a sense, right? It’s the personal brand of Satoshi Nakamoto, backed by technology,” he said.

Many go far beyond simple peer-to-peer payments. Over time, blockchain technology has found broader use. For example, Walmart now uses it to track its food supply chain. Additionally, it powers digital art, gaming assets and more. Major banks have also started experimenting with tokenized financial products. AI, meanwhile, has been widely discussed as both a threat to jobs and a productivity booster. Tenev chose the optimistic view, emphasizing how automation is lowering the cost of creation and increasing access to new markets. “One of the things that AI is making possible is more and more value being created with fewer and fewer resources,” he said. Robinhood Pushes SEC to Recognize Digital Tokens as Traditional Assets Robinhood has aggressively expanded into crypto in recent years. As a result, it now offers a wide range of tokens, including popular meme coins. In the first quarter of this year, the platform’s revenue jumped 50% . This surge was largely fueled by increased cryptocurrency trading. Moreover, profits more than doubled, surpassing analyst expectations. Looking ahead, the company has submitted a detailed proposal to the US SEC, calling for a national framework for tokenized real-world assets . Robinhood argues that digital tokens representing assets like stocks or bonds should be treated as legal equivalents to their traditional forms.

2025-05-28T09:00:27.000Z,"Revolutionary Starknet Asset Runes Bring USDC to Bitcoin","BitcoinWorld Revolutionary Starknet Asset Runes Bring USDC to Bitcoin A significant development is unfolding at the intersection of two major blockchain ecosystems: Ethereum and Bitcoin. Starknet, a leading Ethereum Layer-2 network utilizing ZK-Rollup technology, has just unveiled a groundbreaking initiative aimed at bridging the gap and enhancing utility across chains. This announcement centers around the introduction of Starknet Asset Runes , a novel mechanism designed to bring the liquidity and utility of real-world tokens, starting with USDC, directly onto the Bitcoin network. What Exactly Are Starknet Asset Runes? Via an official announcement on their X account, Starknet introduced Starknet Asset Runes as a new class of assets specifically native to the Bitcoin network. The core concept is to represent non-Bitcoin assets on the Bitcoin blockchain in a 1:1 ratio. Think of them as Bitcoin-native tokens that mirror the value and quantity of assets held on the Starknet network. This isn’t just about creating new tokens; it’s about establishing a direct, verifiable link between assets on Starknet and their representation as Runes on Bitcoin. The initial focus is on bringing USDC on Bitcoin , a stablecoin widely used across the crypto ecosystem for its stability and liquidity. How Do USDC on Bitcoin Runes Work? The mechanics behind the initial launch with USDC are designed for simplicity and trust minimization: 1:1 Minting: Users can mint USDC Runes at a direct 1:1 ratio with their existing USDC holdings on Starknet. For every USDC locked on Starknet, one USDC Rune can be created on the Bitcoin network. Full Backing: These newly minted USDC Runes are fully backed by the corresponding USDC reserves held securely on Starknet. This ensures that each Rune genuinely represents an equivalent value on the Ethereum-linked network. Redemption Mechanism: The process isn’t one-way. USDC Runes minted on Bitcoin can be redeemed back for the underlying USDC on Starknet. This is facilitated via Starknet’s trust-minimized Starknet Bitcoin Bridge . This bridge is crucial as it handles the locking and unlocking of assets on both sides, ensuring the 1:1 peg is maintained without relying on a single point of trust. This system leverages the recently introduced Runes protocol on Bitcoin, which allows for the creation of fungible tokens directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, building upon its native structure. Why is Bringing USDC on Bitcoin Significant? The launch of Starknet Asset Runes and the initial focus on USDC has several profound implications: Expanding USDC Utility: USDC is a cornerstone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and trading on Ethereum and other networks. Bringing it to Bitcoin opens up possibilities for its use within the nascent Bitcoin ecosystem, potentially enabling trading pairs or other financial activities directly on Bitcoin. Accessing Non-Bitcoin Assets: For Bitcoin holders, this creates a pathway to interact with non-Bitcoin assets like stablecoins without necessarily needing to move their primary holdings off the Bitcoin network entirely or engage with complex cross-chain swaps. Enhancing Bitcoin’s Ecosystem: While Bitcoin is primarily known as a store of value, initiatives like Runes and efforts to bring external assets via bridges can potentially enrich its ecosystem, fostering new types of applications and interactions directly on Layer 1 or complementary Layer 2 solutions built on Bitcoin. Scalability and Efficiency: Leveraging Starknet’s Layer-2 technology for the backing and bridging mechanism potentially offers more efficient and cost-effective ways to manage the underlying assets compared to solely relying on Bitcoin’s Layer 1. This move is a clear indicator of the growing desire to interconnect different blockchain ecosystems and leverage the strengths of each. Exploring the Potential of Real-world Assets Bitcoin Integration While USDC is the starting point, the concept of Starknet Asset Runes is designed to facilitate 1:1 exposure to other Real-world assets Bitcoin integrations in the future. This could theoretically include tokenized commodities, stablecoins pegged to other fiat currencies, or even tokenized securities, represented as Runes on the Bitcoin network. This vision aligns with the broader trend of bringing real-world assets onto blockchains to unlock liquidity and create new financial primitives. Representing these assets as Bitcoin Runes could potentially tap into Bitcoin’s vast market capitalization and security guarantees, albeit through a bridged mechanism. The success and adoption of this initiative will heavily rely on the reliability and trust-minimization properties of the Starknet Bitcoin Bridge , as it is the critical link enabling the flow and redemption of assets between the two networks. What Challenges Might Starknet Asset Runes Face? Despite the exciting potential, the path forward isn’t without its hurdles: Adoption: Will Bitcoin users embrace this new way of holding and using non-Bitcoin assets? Education and ease of use will be key. Bridge Security: While described as trust-minimizing, any bridge introduces potential points of failure or complexity. The security and robustness of the Starknet Bitcoin Bridge will be under scrutiny. Ecosystem Development: The utility of USDC Runes on Bitcoin will depend on the development of applications and infrastructure within the Bitcoin ecosystem that can interact with these Runes. Regulatory Clarity: As with any novel crypto asset class, regulatory considerations surrounding real-world asset representation on a blockchain like Bitcoin could emerge. These are factors that the market will watch closely as Starknet Asset Runes roll out beyond the initial phase. Actionable Insights for the Community For those interested in this development, here are some takeaways: Monitor the Rollout: Keep an eye on Starknet’s official channels for detailed instructions on how to mint and redeem USDC Runes via the Starknet Bitcoin Bridge . Understand the Mechanics: Familiarize yourself with how the 1:1 backing and redemption process works to understand the risks and benefits. Observe Ecosystem Reaction: Watch how the Bitcoin and Starknet communities react and whether new applications emerge that leverage USDC Runes. Research Runes Protocol: Gaining a basic understanding of the underlying Bitcoin Runes protocol can provide context for how these assets function natively on Bitcoin. This development is a tangible step towards a more interconnected blockchain future. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards Interoperability Starknet’s launch of Starknet Asset Runes , beginning with the introduction of USDC on Bitcoin , marks a significant and potentially transformative step in cross-chain interoperability. By leveraging the Bitcoin Runes protocol and their own trust-minimizing Starknet Bitcoin Bridge , they are creating a pathway for the utility and liquidity of assets like USDC and potentially other Real-world assets Bitcoin representations to exist directly on the Bitcoin network. While challenges remain, this initiative highlights the ongoing innovation in the blockchain space, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible for asset representation and utility across different ecosystems. It’s a development worth watching closely as it could influence the future landscape of both the Bitcoin and broader crypto markets.

2025-05-28T08:51:54.000Z,"HTX Research: A Fresh Look at Bitcoin Amidst Macro Changes, Featuring HTX’s New Compliant Stablecoin Offerings","BitcoinWorld HTX Research: A Fresh Look at Bitcoin Amidst Macro Changes, Featuring HTX’s New Compliant Stablecoin Offerings SINGAPORE , May 28, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — HTX Research, the research arm of HTX, has just released a crucial new report: “ The New Macroeconomic Landscape and Bitcoin Outlook: An Analysis of Liquidity, Risk Appetite, Policy Dynamics, and Investment Strategy. “ This comprehensive analysis comes at a pivotal time, as the global macroeconomic landscape undergoes profound shifts and the cryptocurrency market, especially Bitcoin’s price movements, becomes increasingly influenced by this complex backdrop. The report offers investors valuable insights, a clear market outlook, and strategic investment guidance on how evolving macroeconomic conditions are shaping the Bitcoin market. Bitcoin Outlook in the Macro Environment: Liquidity & Market Risk Appetite The current global macro environment is complex. A combination of factors, including cooling expectations for Fed rate cuts, ongoing quantitative tightening (QT), the replenishment of the U.S. Treasury General Account (TGA), and anticipated rate hikes by the Bank of Japan , are collectively contributing to tighter short-term liquidity. Over the medium term (3–12 months), liquidity is expected to gradually improve. However, uncertainty surrounding market risk appetite presents both opportunities and challenges for the Bitcoin market. Policy Tug-of-War Signals Crypto-Friendly Shifts: A Loosening Grip on Stablecoin Regulation? The ongoing policy debate is having a significant impact on the crypto market. In a notable development, Hong Kong’s Legislative Council has passed the Stablecoin Bill, which establishes a comprehensive licensing regime for fiat-backed stablecoin issuers in Hong Kong . This legislation further refines the regulatory framework for virtual asset activities within the region, aiming to foster financial stability and consumer protection. The more profound and complex policy impacts are unfolding in the United States . The Trump administration’s “Big Beautiful Tax Plan”, aimed at reducing taxes by $5 trillion over the next decade, has boosted market sentiment in the short term. However, the growing fiscal deficit and debt ceiling issues could spark liquidity volatility. Regarding regulation, the U.S. Senate is making progress on stablecoin legislation. The GENIUS Act seeks to establish a standardized framework for the stablecoin market, mandating backing by 100% high-quality asset reserves. Negotiations have reportedly reached a consensus on approximately 90% of the terms, signaling a strong bipartisan push for regulatory clarity in this critical sector. Additionally, the accelerated exploration of tokenized U.S. equities is noteworthy, with the U.S. SEC is actively researching and evaluating this space, while major financial institutions (e.g., JPMorgan) are strategically positioning themselves in this emerging field. Furthermore, U.S. federal and state initiatives to legislate “strategic Bitcoin reserves,” such as New Hampshire’s H.B. 302 bill, are further elevating Bitcoin’s strategic importance and providing policy support for increased institutional participation. These developments collectively indicate a growing recognition and integration of digital assets within traditional financial and governmental structures. HTX Lists USD1 and Other Compliant Stablecoins, Introduces Zero-Fee Conversion With global policy easing on the horizon and a growing push for regulatory clarity, stablecoins are increasingly solidifying their role as the foundation of liquidity and value pegs within the crypto market. Recognizing this pivotal opportunity, HTX has recently launched a range of compliant stablecoins, including USD1 (World Liberty Financial USD), USDQ (Quantoz), EURQ (Quantoz), USDR (StablR), EURR (StablR),and AETHUSDT (Aave Ethereum USDT). This expansion is designed to meet diverse user investment preferences and boost capital efficiency. To celebrate the launch of USD1 and reduce barriers to user participation, HTX is offering a special zero-fee conversion service. From now until December 31, 2025 , at 15:59 (UTC), users can trade the USD1 /USDT spot pair with no trading fees. This initiative ensures users incur no additional costs during conversion, thereby maximizing their capital utilization. The report concludes that the Bitcoin market may encounter liquidity pressures and volatility risks in the short term. However, the medium to long term holds significant potential for a rebound. This optimistic outlook is largely supported by clearer regulatory policies and growing institutional adoption. HTX will continue to closely monitor market and regulatory trends to help users seize opportunities and achieve steady growth in the complex and evolving crypto landscape.

2025-05-28T08:50:55.000Z,"El Salvador added eight additional BTC, violating IMF terms","El Salvador has purchased eight additional Bitcoins despite warnings from the IMF. The IMF recently restricted the nation from adding more crypto to its reserves as part of a loan deal. Arkham Intelligence revealed the country had reached nearly 6,200 BTC worth over $674 million. According to Arkham Intelligence, El Salvador has bought over 6,200 BTC with a market value of over $674 million. El Salvador added eight more BTC to its reserves despite the IMF warning the nation not to purchase additional crypto. On Tuesday, the IMF pushed the nation to stop crypto acquisitions as part of the conditions of a $1.4 billion loan deal. The country has, on several occasions, defied the IMF restrictions. IMF wants El Salvador to wind down crypto acquisitions EL SALVADOR JUST BOUGHT MORE BITCOIN pic.twitter.com/HlEJMkFIOW — The Bitcoin Office (@bitcoinofficesv) May 28, 2025 The new BTC acquisition announcement came shortly after the IMF and El Salvador’s officials struck an agreement on the first evaluation of the 40-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF). The review, which focused on economic reforms, revealed that the nation had met most targets. The EFF review also praised the country for improving its macroeconomic stability. The IMF said it had achieved progress on structural benchmarks. The financial organization added that it had achieved significant milestones in inflation control in El Salvador. The global financial institution also said that implementing the fiscal reform plan remained critical in creating conditions for more sustainable growth. The IMF also warned that it would strive to ensure that the crypto held in government wallets did not go beyond the greed threshold. The El Salvador government formally paused direct acquisitions of Bitcoin to comply with the IMF’s loan deal terms. However, the country’s Bitcoin Office has continued to make regular purchases. Its official website stated that legal distinction allows the office to continue to make daily Bitcoin acquisitions without undermining performance criteria. Legal reforms in El Salvador stripped Bitcoin of compulsory legal tender status but maintained it as an option currency. The nation made the legal reforms in order to satisfy the terms set by the IMF. According to the IMF, the $1.4 billion loan package would be part of a broader arrangement under the EFF, which is expected to unlock extra financial support, potentially totaling over $3.5 billion. The loan facility would also help the nation manage its public debt load, which had hit 85 percent of El Salvador’s GDP last year. Rodrigo Valdes, the Director of the IMF Western Hemisphere Department, said El Salvador would continue to comply with the terms outlined by the global financial institution. Valdes added that the nation’s commitment to non-accumulation of crypto by the overall fiscal sector was the performance criterion they had in place. El Salvador’s President publicly mocks the IMF’s suggestions The President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, refuted the terms issued by the IMF under its December loan deal agreement. Bukele mocked the IMF’s suggestions just days after the global financial institution revealed new terms that seek to apply pressure on the nation. Bukele said the nation would not stop adding more BTC into its reserves. “This all stops in April.’ This all stops in June.’ This all stops in December.’ No, it’s not stopping.” Nayib Bukele, El Salvador President. The IMF’s new rules aimed to set up continuous quantitative performance criteria with a ‘ceiling of o’ on all government BTC purchases. The purchase of BTC using taxpayers’ money has previously put the nation under the scrutiny of the global financial watchdog. In 2022, the IMF urged the nation to strip Bitcoin of its legal tender status, citing risks to consumer protections and financial stability after it approved its use in 2021. In October last year, the IMF suggested narrowing the scope of El Salvador’s Bitcoin Law. The global financial institution said that limiting the reach of the country’s Bitcoin law would strengthen regulatory frameworks and limit public exposure to the digital asset. The IMF made these suggestions after the country suffered multiple credit rating downgrades by Fitch and Moody’s in 2022. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-05-28T08:48:01.000Z,"Bitcoin Surges Ahead as Strategy Stock Lags","Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this piece owns shares of Strategy (MSTR). Since the start of this month, a growing divergence has emerged between bitcoin BTC and bitcoin-HODLer Strategy (MSTR). While bitcoin has climbed approximately 13%, nearing the $110,000 mark, MSTR shares have slipped 3%, trading around $372. This performance gap has become more pronounced since mid-May and raises questions about market sentiment toward the company that pioneered the bitcoin treasury strategy for corporations. Despite playing a leading role in this movement, Strategy’s stock has not mirrored bitcoin’s latest rally. One key factor is the rapid increase in the number of public companies adopting similar bitcoin strategies. According to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net , over 113 public companies globally now hold bitcoin on their balance sheets, marking an increase of 11 new entrants over the past 30 days. Many appear to be following Strategy’s playbook, but the firm’s market premium is compressing, indicating that its early-mover advantage may be fading. Strategy’s multiple to net asset value (mNAV), which reflects how the market values the company relative to its bitcoin holdings, has dropped to 1.80 one of its lowest points over the past year. This figure is calculated by dividing the enterprise value (EV) by the market value of its bitcoin holdings. The EV includes MSTR’s current market cap, convertible debt, and preferred shares (such as STRK and STRF), minus the company’s most recent reported cash balance. A lower mNAV limits Strategy’s ability to issue new equity without significantly diluting existing shareholders, although it remains above 1x, preserving some headroom. Strategy’s recent 4,020 BTC purchase, its smallest since May 5, also reveals a significant change in funding structure. The acquisition was financed not only through common stock but also through preferred securities — 81.7% from common stock, 15.9% from STRK, and 2.4% from STRF, according to MSTR analyst Ben Werkman . This diversification indicates that the company is strategically tapping alternative instruments via its at-the-market (ATM) offering, possibly to mitigate shareholder dilution and optimize capital raising in a compressed mNAV environment.

2025-05-28T08:40:19.000Z,"Bitcoin ETF Inflows: US Spot BTC ETFs Witness Astonishing $386.77M Surge, Marking Ninth Straight Day","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETF Inflows: US Spot BTC ETFs Witness Astonishing $386.77M Surge, Marking Ninth Straight Day Are you tracking the pulse of the crypto market ? If so, you’ve likely noticed a significant trend emerging from the world of traditional finance converging with digital assets. US spot Bitcoin ETF products are currently experiencing a robust period of growth, highlighted by a notable streak of positive investment flows. What’s Driving the Latest Bitcoin ETF Inflows ? The recent data paints a compelling picture. On May 27th, US spot Bitcoin ETF products collectively saw a substantial net inflow totaling $386.77 million. This wasn’t a one-off event; it marked the ninth consecutive day that more money flowed into these investment vehicles than out. This consistent positive trend is a strong indicator of sustained investor interest and confidence in Bitcoin as an asset class accessible through regulated financial products. Let’s break down where these BTC ETF inflows are originating and which funds are leading the charge: BlackRock’s IBIT: Once again, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) dominated the inflows, pulling in a massive $410.72 million on May 27th alone. IBIT has consistently been a top performer since its launch. Grayscale’s mini BTC: The newly launched Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC) also saw positive movement, adding $36.03 million. This smaller fee product seems to be attracting capital. VanEck’s HODL: VanEck’s Bitcoin Trust (HODL) contributed positively with $7.77 million in inflows. Bitwise’s BITB: The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) recorded $1.79 million in net inflows. Valkyrie’s BRRR: Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR) rounded out the positive contributors with $0.47 million. While many funds enjoyed inflows, some experienced outflows on the same day: ARK Invest’s ARKB: The ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) saw $38.34 million exit the fund. Grayscale’s GBTC: The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which converted from a trust to an ETF, continued its trend of outflows, losing $26.87 million. This is often attributed to investors moving to lower-fee alternatives, including Grayscale’s own mini BTC. Fidelity’s FBTC: The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), another major player, experienced a modest outflow of $4.79 million. Other spot Bitcoin ETF products reported no change in their holdings for the day, indicating stable, albeit not growing, investor interest on May 27th. Why Do Consecutive BTC ETF Inflows Matter for the Crypto Market ? Nine consecutive days of net inflows is a significant streak for the US spot Bitcoin ETF market. Here’s why it’s important: Institutional Adoption: ETFs are a preferred investment vehicle for institutional investors, wealth managers, and traditional retail investors who may be hesitant to buy Bitcoin directly on crypto exchanges. Sustained inflows suggest growing adoption from these larger capital pools. Validation of Bitcoin: Consistent demand for spot Bitcoin ETF products serves as a form of validation for Bitcoin as a legitimate and desirable asset in traditional finance. Potential Price Impact: While not a direct one-to-one correlation, sustained inflows into ETFs increase the demand for underlying Bitcoin (as ETFs buy BTC to back their shares), which can contribute positively to Bitcoin’s price dynamics in the crypto market . Market Sentiment: A long streak of inflows builds positive sentiment around Bitcoin and the broader crypto space, potentially attracting more investors. The strong performance of funds like BlackRock’s IBIT highlights the competitive landscape and the success of established financial giants in capturing market share in the burgeoning Bitcoin ETF inflows sector. What’s Next for the Spot Bitcoin ETF Landscape? The current trend of positive Bitcoin ETF inflows suggests continued appetite for exposure to Bitcoin through regulated products. While daily flows can fluctuate, the sustained nine-day streak indicates underlying strength in demand. Investors and market watchers will be closely monitoring whether this trend continues and how it impacts the overall crypto market . The competition among issuers remains fierce, with fees and performance being key factors influencing investor choice. The emergence of Grayscale’s mini BTC as a fund attracting inflows, even as the larger GBTC sees outflows, demonstrates the market’s sensitivity to costs. In conclusion, the US spot Bitcoin ETF market is experiencing a period of significant positive momentum, marked by nearly $387 million in net inflows on May 27th and a remarkable nine-day streak of positive flows. This trend underscores growing institutional and retail interest, providing a bullish signal for the accessibility and adoption of Bitcoin within traditional finance and potentially influencing the broader crypto market dynamics.

2025-05-28T08:37:40.000Z,"Three arrested in New York for torturing Italian tourist in Bitcoin wallet robbery","Authorities in New York have arrested three individuals for kidnapping and torturing an Italian tourist in a failed attempt to steal his cryptocurrency holdings. According to a New York Times report , the third suspect, 33-year-old William Duplessie, surrendered to police on May 27 following days of negotiations and faces multiple charges, including kidnapping, assault, unlawful imprisonment, and criminal possession of a weapon, and was remanded without bail. Duplessie’s arrest came days after police detained 37-year-old crypto investor John Woeltz and 24-year-old Beatrice Folchi. Woeltz remains in custody on kidnapping and firearms charges, while Folchi was released shortly after her arrest with prosecution deferred, according to officials. The case came to light on May 24, when the victim, 28-year-old Italian tourist Michael Valentino Teofrasto Carturan, escaped from a luxury townhouse in Manhattan’s NoLIta neighborhood. Carturan was reportedly lured back to New York by Woeltz under false pretenses after the two fell out over financial disputes linked to a crypto hedge fund. On May 6, shortly after arriving at the Manhattan townhouse, Carturan was ambushed by Woeltz and Folchi, who allegedly sought access to a Bitcoin wallet said to hold millions. Over the next three weeks, he was subjected to repeated assaults while being held captive. According to prosecutors, he was bound with electrical cords, beaten with a firearm, and subjected to electric shocks while his feet were submerged in water. Investigators found extensive evidence inside the rental property, including photographs of the torture, weapons, a ballistic vest, chicken wire, broken furniture, and blood stains, particularly on the third floor. Carturan escaped barefoot, flagged down a traffic officer, and relayed the details of his captivity. Surveillance footage shows him in visible distress as he fled the property wearing athletic shorts and carrying a small black bag. Criminals target crypto investors The case has drawn fresh attention to a growing trend of violent crimes targeting cryptocurrency investors. Law enforcement agencies globally have begun to register a sharp rise in such cases , with attackers using increasingly sophisticated tactics to extract digital assets from victims. On the same day as Duplessie’s surrender, French police arrested over a dozen suspects, many of them minors, in connection with two attempted kidnappings in Paris. In one case, the father of a crypto entrepreneur was abducted and mutilated by a gang demanding a €5 to €7 million ransom in cryptocurrency. The assailants, disguised in a fake UPS van, severed the man’s finger to pressure his son. He was later rescued in a raid by the Brigade de Répression du Banditisme. In a separate incident in the French capital, three masked individuals tried to abduct the daughter of Paymium CEO Pierre Noizat in broad daylight. She managed to escape with help from bystanders. Authorities suspect the involvement of a larger criminal network. In response, France’s Interior Ministry has ramped up security for crypto executives and their families. Elsewhere in the US, three Florida teenagers were recently charged with kidnapping, robbery, and extortion after allegedly abducting a man and stealing $4 million in cryptocurrency and NFTs.

MetaMask previously provided access to networks other than Ethereum through plugins called “Snaps,” but this new update is the first to integrate the Solana network directly into MetaMask’s main interface. “Solana is just the beginning,” MetaMask said, adding that “we aim to add support for more non-EVM networks in the coming months, eliminating the hassle of users having to juggle multiple wallets.” Bitcoin Support Also On The Way In a statement made in February, it was stated that MetaMask would offer support not only for Solana but also for the Bitcoin network in the third quarter of 2025. These steps are seen as part of the platform’s strategy to expand multi-blockchain support. With an estimated 100 million annual users, MetaMask stands out as one of the world's largest non-custodial crypto wallets. MetaMask has long been speculated about the possibility of launching its own crypto token. Joseph Lubin, CEO of parent company Consensys, stated that the MetaMask token could contribute to making the platform more decentralized in 2022. MetaMask co-founder Dan Finlay said on the Crypto Beat Podcast earlier this month that the token launch was still “uncertain,” but acknowledged that the new regulatory environment for crypto in the U.S. offers more leeway for token launches. In February, the parties in an ongoing enforcement case between MetaMask and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that they had reached a settlement. This development comes after other similar lawsuits against major crypto companies such as Coinbase and Kraken were dropped. MetaMask’s integration with Solana is considered an important step towards simplifying the user experience across different blockchains. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-28T08:30:15.000Z,"US Government Explores SHOCKING Debt-Free Bitcoin Purchase Plan","BitcoinWorld US Government Explores SHOCKING Debt-Free Bitcoin Purchase Plan Imagine this: The United States government, the world’s largest economy, is reportedly looking into buying Bitcoin. But not just any purchase – they’re exploring ways to do it without adding a single cent to the national debt. This fascinating development, if true, signals a potentially massive shift in how major nations view and interact with digital assets. According to a report from South Korean news outlet Maeil Business Newspaper, the idea was discussed by David Sacks, identified as a White House crypto czar, at the Bitcoin Conference 2025 in Las Vegas. While Sacks is widely known as a prominent venture capitalist and tech entrepreneur, not an official government appointee, the report suggests discussions around official U.S. interest in Bitcoin are taking place at high levels. What is This US Government Bitcoin Exploration All About? At its core, the report details an exploration into acquiring Bitcoin for a national strategic reserve. This isn’t a new concept globally; many countries hold reserves of gold, oil, or foreign currencies for economic stability or strategic reasons. Applying this concept to Bitcoin is where things get particularly interesting for the US government Bitcoin strategy. The key phrase here is ‘debt-free’. The report indicates that the government is studying how to redirect surplus funds from other policies towards these Bitcoin acquisitions. This approach aims to avoid the need for borrowing or increasing the federal budget deficit, aligning with a potential requirement for a ‘budget-neutral’ system, as mentioned in relation to a hypothetical executive order from President Trump regarding a national strategic Bitcoin reserve. This suggests a creative approach to integrating digital assets into national strategy, leveraging existing financial flows rather than creating new debt obligations. The implications of the US government Bitcoin involvement are vast, potentially influencing global financial markets, regulatory approaches, and the perception of Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value and strategic asset. Why Would the US Need a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve? The concept of a strategic Bitcoin reserve opens up numerous possibilities regarding national strategy and economic policy. Why would a nation like the United States consider holding significant amounts of Bitcoin? Here are a few potential reasons: Economic Hedge: Bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Holding it could provide a layer of economic security against potential instability in traditional markets or the U.S. dollar itself. National Security: In an increasingly digital world, controlling or having access to significant digital assets could be crucial for national security. It could provide leverage in a digital economy or offer alternative financial rails in times of crisis. Technological Leadership: By actively participating in the digital asset space through direct holdings, the U.S. could signal its commitment to embracing future financial technologies and potentially influence global standards and adoption. Geopolitical Tool: Bitcoin operates outside traditional financial systems controlled by nation-states. A reserve could potentially be used in geopolitical maneuvering, although the specifics of how this would work are complex and speculative. Setting a Precedent: A move by the U.S. to hold Bitcoin would lend significant legitimacy to the asset class on a global stage, potentially encouraging other nations and institutions to follow suit. The idea of a strategic Bitcoin reserve is ambitious and would require significant political will and technical infrastructure. However, the reported exploration suggests these potential benefits are being seriously considered at high levels. How Could a Debt-Free Bitcoin Purchase Plan Actually Work? The notion of a debt-free Bitcoin purchase plan is perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this report. How could the U.S. government acquire a potentially large amount of a volatile asset like Bitcoin without incurring new debt? Based on the report’s mention of ‘surplus funds’ and ‘budget-neutral’ requirements, here are some potential mechanisms being explored: Redirecting Unspent Budget Allocations: Governments often have budget surpluses in certain departments or from specific policies. These funds, if not legally earmarked for other purposes, could theoretically be reallocated. Asset Sales: The government holds various assets, from real estate to seized assets from illicit activities. Selling non-strategic assets could generate funds for Bitcoin purchases without increasing debt. Tax Revenue Windfalls: Unexpected increases in tax revenue (e.g., from economic booms or specific industry taxes) could provide a pool of surplus funds. Seized Cryptocurrency Assets: The U.S. government has already seized significant amounts of cryptocurrency from criminal activities. These assets could potentially be held in a reserve rather than sold off immediately, effectively forming a ‘debt-free’ acquisition method, although the report specifically mentions ‘purchasing’ additional Bitcoin. Specific Legislation/Policy Changes: New laws could be enacted to create dedicated funding mechanisms for digital asset acquisition that are designed to be budget-neutral over time, perhaps through fees or specific revenue streams. Implementing a debt-free Bitcoin acquisition strategy would require careful planning and likely new legislative frameworks. It moves beyond theoretical discussion into the realm of practical, albeit complex, financial engineering on a national scale. Challenges and Considerations for a Bitcoin Purchase Plan While the potential benefits of a Bitcoin purchase plan for the U.S. are significant, the challenges are equally formidable. Any move by the government into holding substantial digital assets would face intense scrutiny and require navigating complex legal, regulatory, and political landscapes. Key challenges include: Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite increasing clarity, the regulatory status of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the U.S. is still evolving. A government holding would necessitate clear legal definitions and frameworks. Political Opposition: There are diverse views on cryptocurrency within the U.S. government and among the public. A plan to buy Bitcoin could face significant political hurdles and ideological opposition. Volatility Risk: Bitcoin is known for its price volatility. Holding a large reserve would expose the government to significant potential fluctuations in value, which could be politically sensitive. Security: Securing a national reserve of Bitcoin against hacks, theft, or loss would require state-of-the-art security protocols and infrastructure, the likes of which have not been implemented on this scale for digital assets by a government. Custody Solutions: Who would hold the keys? This is a critical question for any large Bitcoin holder, and for a government, the implications are immense. Secure, transparent, and accountable custody solutions would be paramount. Public Perception: The idea of the government buying a speculative asset like Bitcoin might not sit well with all taxpayers, potentially leading to public relations challenges. Impact on Markets: Significant purchases by the U.S. government could have a substantial impact on Bitcoin’s market price and liquidity, potentially creating unintended consequences. Addressing these challenges would be critical for any successful Bitcoin purchase plan . The exploration phase likely involves assessing how these hurdles could be overcome or mitigated. What Does This Mean for White House Crypto Strategy and Beyond? The mere fact that discussions around a White House crypto strategy could involve direct Bitcoin acquisition, even if through ‘debt-free’ methods, signifies a potential shift in official thinking. Historically, government focus has been more on regulation, taxation, and exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). This report suggests a more proactive approach, viewing Bitcoin not just as something to be regulated, but potentially as an asset with strategic value. It aligns with broader global trends where nations are increasingly considering the role of digital assets in the future financial landscape. While the specific details reported via the Maeil Business Newspaper and the attribution to David Sacks require careful consideration, the underlying idea – the U.S. exploring strategic, budget-neutral Bitcoin acquisition – is highly significant. It suggests that digital assets are moving from the fringes of policy discussion to potentially becoming components of national economic and security strategy. Actionable Insights for Readers: For investors and those interested in the crypto space, this report highlights the increasing potential for institutional and even sovereign adoption of Bitcoin. Key takeaways include: Stay Informed: Follow news and official statements regarding U.S. crypto policy closely. This area is evolving rapidly. Understand the ‘Why’: Recognize the potential strategic reasons governments might consider holding Bitcoin, which goes beyond simple investment. Assess Market Impact: While speculative, any confirmed government interest or purchase could significantly impact market dynamics. Consider the Long-Term View: Reports like this reinforce the idea that Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a long-term, potentially strategic asset by powerful entities. This development, if it progresses, could reshape perceptions and accelerate the integration of Bitcoin into the global financial system in ways previously thought improbable. Conclusion: A New Era for US Government and Bitcoin? The report suggesting the U.S. government is exploring debt-free methods to purchase Bitcoin for a strategic reserve is a landmark piece of news. While details are attributed to a specific source and context (Maeil Business Newspaper, David Sacks at Bitcoin Conference 2025), the core idea signals a potential monumental shift in how a major global power might engage with digital assets. The concept of a strategic Bitcoin reserve , funded without increasing national debt through mechanisms like surplus funds, presents both exciting possibilities and significant challenges. It speaks to Bitcoin’s growing recognition as a potential store of value, a hedge, and even a tool for national strategy in the digital age. Whether this exploration leads to concrete policy remains to be seen. However, the fact that such discussions are reportedly taking place at this level underscores the increasing importance of Bitcoin and digital assets in the global economic and political landscape. It’s a development that demands attention and could herald a new era for the relationship between sovereign nations and decentralized digital currencies.

2025-05-28T08:20:12.000Z,"Donald Trump Crypto Shift: How His Sons Sparked a Stunning Change","BitcoinWorld Donald Trump Crypto Shift: How His Sons Sparked a Stunning Change Imagine this: the former U.S. President, known for his focus on tangible assets like real estate, is now reportedly stepping into the digital asset space. This isn’t a sudden change of heart out of nowhere. According to Donald Trump Jr. at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, it was a deliberate effort by him and his brother Eric Trump to ‘orange-pill’ their father into the Donald Trump crypto world. Understanding the ‘Orange Pill’ Phenomenon What exactly does it mean to be ‘orange-pilled’? In the cryptocurrency community, getting ‘orange-pilled’ is a metaphor for someone deeply understanding and becoming convinced of the value and potential of Bitcoin, often leading to significant investment or advocacy. It’s not just about buying crypto; it’s about grasping the underlying principles of decentralization, scarcity, and resistance to traditional financial control. For the Trump family, whose wealth and business have historically been rooted in hard assets like real estate, Bitcoin initially seemed ‘a bit nebulous,’ as Don Jr. described it. This perspective is common among those accustomed to tangible wealth. The idea of value stored purely digitally can be a difficult concept to embrace at first. From Real Estate to the Crypto World: A Family’s Journey The Trump family’s traditional focus has always been on solid, physical assets. Real estate, in particular, has been central to their brand and fortune. This background provides a stark contrast to the intangible nature of digital currencies. However, their experiences after entering the political arena seem to have opened their eyes to the vulnerabilities within the existing system. Donald Trump Jr. highlighted that their family has faced challenges like debanking and de-insurance. These actions, stemming from political or other pressures, demonstrated how easily access to traditional financial services can be restricted or revoked. This personal experience served as a powerful lesson on the potential fragility of the traditional finance system, which many people take for granted. This vulnerability within traditional financial systems became a key factor in re-evaluating alternatives. While real estate remains a core asset, the inability to freely access banking or insurance services underscored the need for systems that are more resilient and less susceptible to centralized control or political pressure. Boosting Bitcoin Adoption: The Sons’ Influence It appears that Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump played a crucial role in bridging the gap between their father’s traditional asset mindset and the burgeoning crypto world . Don Jr. explicitly stated that he and Eric “definitely” influenced their father’s understanding of crypto and blockchain technology. This suggests a series of conversations, explanations, and perhaps even demonstrations to help the former President grasp the concepts. Their efforts likely focused on explaining not just how crypto works, but why it matters, especially in the context of the financial challenges their family encountered. Highlighting the decentralized nature of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, their resistance to censorship, and their potential as a store of value independent of traditional banking could have been persuasive points. This personal connection and trust likely made the ‘orange-pilling’ process more effective than general market trends or news reports. Implications for Bitcoin Adoption and Beyond The news of Donald Trump’s potential shift towards crypto, influenced by his sons, could have interesting implications. While it doesn’t automatically guarantee a specific policy stance if he were to return to office, it signals a growing awareness and potential acceptance of digital assets among influential figures. For the broader market, any positive sentiment or engagement from a high-profile individual like a former U.S. President can draw significant attention. Increased awareness among political figures could potentially lead to more informed discussions about crypto regulation and policy. Furthermore, if this leads to the Trump family publicly engaging more with digital assets, it could influence a segment of their supporters, potentially contributing to broader Bitcoin adoption among demographics that might not have previously considered cryptocurrency. This story underscores how personal experiences and trusted sources can be powerful drivers for understanding and adopting new technologies, even something as disruptive as cryptocurrency. Key Takeaways from the Trump Family’s Crypto Journey This anecdote from the Bitcoin 2025 conference offers several valuable insights: Personal Experience Matters: The challenges faced with traditional finance directly influenced their openness to alternatives. Education is Key: The sons played a vital role in educating their father about complex concepts. Shift in Perspective: Moving from tangible assets to understanding digital value requires a fundamental shift. Fragility of Centralized Systems: Debanking highlighted the risks associated with reliance on centralized financial institutions. Potential for Broader Adoption: High-profile individuals exploring crypto can increase mainstream curiosity and potentially accelerate Bitcoin adoption . While the extent of Donald Trump’s personal involvement or investment in crypto remains largely private, the revelation that his sons actively guided him into understanding this space is a significant data point. It shows that even individuals deeply rooted in traditional financial thinking can begin to explore and appreciate the potential of the crypto world , often spurred by direct experiences or trusted relationships. Summary: A Family’s Influence Sparks a Digital Interest The story shared by Donald Trump Jr. at the Bitcoin 2025 conference provides a fascinating glimpse into how personal influence and real-world financial challenges are shaping perspectives on cryptocurrency within the Trump family. From viewing Bitcoin as ‘nebulous’ to exploring its potential as a hedge against the vulnerabilities of traditional finance , the journey underscores a notable shift. The active role played by his sons in ‘orange-pilling’ the former President highlights the growing integration of digital assets into even the most traditional circles. This development could have interesting ripple effects on public perception and potentially contribute to the ongoing trend of Bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the overall crypto world .

2025-05-28T08:12:45.000Z,"Crypto Market Today: Nvidia Earnings and Fed Minutes Could Shift Bitcoin Price","The post Crypto Market Today: Nvidia Earnings and Fed Minutes Could Shift Bitcoin Price appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is entering a decisive week, with Bitcoin testing key support levels and traders closely monitoring Nvidia’s earnings and the Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes for potential catalysts. Alongside Bitcoin, XRP and Solana are also showing key technical setups. Bitcoin Holds at $108K Amid Profit-Taking Pressure Bitcoin is consolidating above $108,900, supported by a trendline in place since early April. Despite positive developments—including Circle’s IPO plans and news of a proposed $2.5 billion Bitcoin allocation by Trump Media —BTC has been unable to reclaim the $110K level. Glassnode data shows whales holding over 10,000 BTC have started to reduce positions, signaling light profit-taking. While broader sentiment remains positive, analysts caution that a drop below $104,000 could trigger a deeper correction toward the mid-$90,000s. Still, persistent ETF inflows continue to support Bitcoin’s long-term uptrend by absorbing market supply. Market Eyes Nvidia and Fed Minutes for Direction Investor focus is now on Nvidia’s earnings report and the Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes. Nvidia’s performance in the AI sector has historically correlated with broader risk asset trends, including crypto. A strong report could boost market sentiment and reignite upward momentum. Meanwhile, traders await the Fed’s tone on inflation and interest rates. While earlier concerns were tied to proposed tariff policies , recent delays may limit the impact of hawkish language—unless unexpected commentary emerges. XRP Holds Strong as XRPFi Ecosystem Gains Traction XRP is holding above its 200-day simple moving average, maintaining a bullish posture. Renewed interest is building around the emerging XRPFi ecosystem, powered by Ripple’s EVM-compatible sidechain and DeFi protocols like Strobe Finance. Glassnode highlights that over $2.15 billion worth of dormant XRP is held in inactive wallets. If this idle capital flows into XRPFi applications, it could stimulate growth on the XRP Ledger and lift XRP prices in the coming weeks. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Conference 2025: Winklevoss Twins Fuel $1M BTC Talk, Claim “Orange Is the New Gold” , Solana Aims for $220 If $180 Resistance Breaks Solana is gradually building upward momentum, recently testing the $187 level. According to analyst Pentoshi , SOL must convert the $180 resistance into support to target a move toward $220. The price action reflects growing confidence, but confirmation will require sustained trading above the breakout level, along with increasing user activity and on-chain adoption. Conclusion The crypto market stands at a key technical and macroeconomic crossroads. Bitcoin’s current consolidation, paired with influential external events like Nvidia’s earnings and the Fed minutes, could set the tone for short-term price direction. Meanwhile, assets like XRP and Solana show promising signs of breakout potential, supported by ecosystem growth and investor interest. As always, while long-term sentiment remains bullish, short-term volatility and policy risks should be carefully monitored. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-28T08:10:03.000Z,"KindlyMD Makes Bold Bitcoin Treasury Move, Acquires 21 BTC for $2.3M","BitcoinWorld KindlyMD Makes Bold Bitcoin Treasury Move, Acquires 21 BTC for $2.3M In a significant move signaling growing institutional interest in digital assets, KindlyMD, a U.S.-based healthcare data company, has announced a substantial investment in the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This acquisition is part of a strategic shift towards incorporating Bitcoin into its corporate treasury. What is the KindlyMD Bitcoin Acquisition? KindlyMD recently revealed its purchase of 21 Bitcoin (BTC) for approximately $2.3 million. The acquisition was made at a weighted average price of $109,027 per BTC. This investment represents a notable step for a healthcare data company entering the cryptocurrency space. The funding for this KindlyMD Bitcoin purchase came from the gross proceeds of a recent exercise of outstanding warrants. This exercise generated $8,748,370 and resulted in the issuance of 1,437,362 shares of common stock. Utilizing a portion of these funds for a Bitcoin acquisition underscores a deliberate decision by KindlyMD’s leadership. Implementing a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy The acquisition is explicitly linked to KindlyMD’s intention to implement a Bitcoin treasury strategy . This approach involves holding Bitcoin as a significant asset on the company’s balance sheet, similar to how traditional companies hold cash, gold, or other reserve assets. A Bitcoin treasury strategy can serve several purposes for a corporation: Inflation Hedge: Protecting corporate value against the potential devaluation of fiat currencies. Potential Appreciation: Gaining exposure to the potential long-term price growth of Bitcoin. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to traditional holdings. Signaling Innovation: Demonstrating forward-thinking and adaptability in a digital economy. KindlyMD’s adoption of this strategy aligns it with a growing list of public and private companies exploring or already holding Bitcoin. Why Corporate Bitcoin Adoption is on the Rise KindlyMD’s move is part of a broader trend of Corporate Bitcoin adoption . While still relatively nascent, companies across various sectors are beginning to view Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset but as a legitimate component of a modern corporate treasury. The pioneers in this space, like MicroStrategy, which holds tens of thousands of BTC, have paved the way and provided a framework for others to follow. Factors driving this trend include: Increasing macroeconomic uncertainty and inflation concerns. The maturing infrastructure surrounding Bitcoin (custody solutions, regulated exchanges). Growing acceptance and understanding of Bitcoin as a store of value. The potential for significant returns compared to low-yield traditional investments. KindlyMD, as a healthcare data company, adds an interesting dimension to the narrative of Corporate Bitcoin adoption , demonstrating that this strategy isn’t limited to tech or finance sectors. A Healthcare Company Embraces Bitcoin It’s particularly noteworthy that a Healthcare company Bitcoin purchase is making headlines. The healthcare sector is often perceived as more conservative regarding financial strategies. KindlyMD’s decision highlights a potential shift, where companies focused on data and technology within healthcare might be more open to innovative financial approaches. While the primary business of KindlyMD remains healthcare data, integrating Bitcoin into its treasury suggests a belief in the digital asset’s long-term value and its potential role in a future digital economy that may intersect with healthcare data management and transactions. The question arises: will other healthcare or data-intensive companies follow suit? KindlyMD’s move could serve as a case study for how a Healthcare company Bitcoin strategy can be implemented and managed. The Role of Nakamoto Holdings in the Merger This strategic Bitcoin acquisition is closely tied to KindlyMD’s proposed merger with Nakamoto Holdings . Nakamoto Holdings is described as a Bitcoin holding company founded by David Bailey. David Bailey is a well-known figure in the crypto space, particularly recognized for his role as a crypto advisor to U.S. President Donald Trump. His involvement and the nature of Nakamoto Holdings as a dedicated Bitcoin entity strongly suggest that the post-merger company will have a significant focus on Bitcoin, both operationally and strategically. The merger indicates a deliberate move by KindlyMD to align itself with a company deeply embedded in the Bitcoin ecosystem. This alignment likely provides expertise, resources, and a shared vision for a Bitcoin-centric future that KindlyMD might not have had independently. What Does This Mean for KindlyMD and the Market? For KindlyMD, this move solidifies its commitment to a digital asset future. It positions the company, post-merger with Nakamoto Holdings, as potentially one of the few publicly traded entities with significant exposure to both healthcare data and Bitcoin. For the broader market, this serves as another data point illustrating the increasing diversification of companies exploring or adopting Bitcoin for their balance sheets. While the 21 BTC purchase is modest compared to the holdings of major corporations, the fact that it’s a healthcare data company signals the expanding reach of Corporate Bitcoin adoption . Challenges and Considerations While the potential benefits of a Bitcoin treasury strategy are clear, companies adopting this approach also face challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile, potentially impacting the company’s balance sheet value in the short term. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Custody and Security: Securely storing significant amounts of Bitcoin requires specialized knowledge and infrastructure. Accounting Treatment: The accounting rules for holding digital assets can be complex. KindlyMD, especially through its proposed merger with Nakamoto Holdings , is likely preparing to navigate these challenges with expert guidance. Conclusion: A Strategic Step Forward KindlyMD’s acquisition of 21 BTC marks a significant strategic decision, positioning the healthcare data company at the intersection of traditional business and the digital asset economy. Fueled by proceeds from warrant exercises and anticipating a merger with Nakamoto Holdings , this move signals a firm commitment to a Bitcoin treasury strategy . As more companies explore Corporate Bitcoin adoption , KindlyMD’s example, particularly as a Healthcare company Bitcoin holder, provides a unique case study. It highlights the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate corporate asset and underscores the evolving financial strategies of businesses looking towards the future. This development is a testament to the growing maturity of the Bitcoin ecosystem and its potential to integrate with diverse industries.

2025-05-28T08:00:59.000Z,"Ethereum Ready For $3,000 Breakout? Analysts Say Sideways Action Is About To End","Following a notable performance over the past 24 hours, Ethereum (ETH) is attempting to reclaim a key level as support. Some analysts suggest a breakout toward the $3,000 mark could be coming if the $2,600 mark holds. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) To Continue Price Discovery Rally If It Holds These Levels – Analyst Ethereum Prepares For Massive Breakout On Tuesday, Ethereum surged to the $2,700 resistance after a 6.3% price jump in the daily timeframe. The cryptocurrency climbed from the $2,500 support zone toward the recent resistance level, hitting the $2,712 mark before retracing. ETH has been unable to cross this zone after recording its three-month high of $2,738 two weeks ago, halting its retest of higher horizontal levels. Notably, the King of Altcoins has surged over 50% in the past month and around 98% from April’s lows. Amid the May crypto market rally, which saw Bitcoin hit a new All-Time High (ATH) of $111,953 last week, Ethereum has traded sideways for most of the month, hovering between the $2,450-$2,600 price range. Nonetheless, ETH has outperformed Bitcoin so far during the second quarter, registering a 47.78% increase since April started. Analyst The Cryptonomist pointed out that Ethereum has broken above the $2,600 level, signaling that a reclaim of this level could conclude ETH’s sideways action between its current price range and propel its price toward the $3,400 mark. Similarly, Crypto Bullet affirmed that ETH is “about to break out and fill the big CME Gap.” According to the chart, the Altcoin appears to be forming a symmetrical triangle over the past few weeks, and is currently attempting to break out from the formation. A successful breakout and retest of the $2,700 level could send ETH’s price to the CME GAP levels, between $2,900 and $3,350, which other analysts also believe will be filled soon. ETH Dominance To Surge In June? Meanwhile, analyst Rekt Capital noted that Ethereum Dominance is “showcasing initial signs of trying to hold the ~9% level as support,” suggesting a potential bullish performance in June. As the analyst explained, ETH dominance has bounced since dropping to new All-Time Lows (ATL) last month, playing out “the full extent of its September 2019 upside.” Keeping this level as support could propel the cryptocurrency to a more market-dominant performance next month, resembling its 2019 playbook. Related Reading: Indecisive Close For Litecoin, But The Real Story Lies In BTC.D’s Next Move Market watcher Merlijn The Trader affirmed that Ethereum’s chart “is screaming bullish,” showing a multi-year base and “clean” bullish pennant pattern. To the trader, this setup could launch the cryptocurrency to a long-term target of $8,000 after breaking above the $3,000 mark. Additionally, ETH is preparing for the cycle’s “final pump,” according to Merlijn, based on its previous performances. He pointed out that Ethereum “goes vertical” after breaking its previous high every cycle. As of this writing, Ethereum trades at $2,686, an 8.8% increase in the weekly timeframe.

2025-05-28T08:00:10.000Z,"Bitcoin Multisig Pioneer Asigna Secures Crucial $3M Crypto Funding","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Multisig Pioneer Asigna Secures Crucial $3M Crypto Funding In the ever-evolving world of digital assets, the need for robust security solutions is paramount. For holders of Bitcoin, the original and most prominent cryptocurrency, protecting their holdings is a constant priority. This is where innovative approaches like Bitcoin Multisig come into play, offering enhanced layers of protection beyond standard single-signature wallets. A significant development in this space recently occurred with the announcement that Asigna, a platform focused on smart multisig vaults for Bitcoin and its layer-2 protocols, has successfully closed a substantial seed funding round. Understanding the Asigna Platform and its Importance At its core, the Asigna Platform is designed to provide a sophisticated, non-custodial solution for managing Bitcoin. Traditional Bitcoin wallets rely on a single private key to authorize transactions. If that key is compromised, lost, or stolen, the funds are at risk. Multisig, or multi-signature, wallets require multiple keys to authorize a transaction. For example, a 2-of-3 multisig wallet requires at least two out of three designated keys to sign off on a transaction. Asigna takes this concept further with its ‘smart’ multisig vault. While the specifics of their ‘smart’ features were not detailed in the initial announcement, this often implies additional capabilities built into the multisig script or associated tools. These could include: More flexible signing policies Time-locks or conditional spending rules Integration with identity or recovery mechanisms Enhanced scripting capabilities for complex use cases The platform is specifically built for Bitcoin and its growing ecosystem of layer-2 protocols, such as the Lightning Network or Liquid. This focus is crucial as layer-2 solutions gain traction for faster and cheaper transactions, but still require secure management of the underlying Bitcoin. By offering a dedicated, smart multisig solution for these layers, Asigna aims to fill a critical gap in the infrastructure needed for Bitcoin’s continued adoption and scalability. Fueling Growth: The $3M Crypto Funding Round The announcement that Asigna has raised Crypto Funding to the tune of $3 million in a seed round signals strong investor confidence in their approach and the market need for advanced Bitcoin security solutions. The round was notably led by prominent firms in the digital asset investment space, including Hivemind Capital and Tykhe Block Ventures. They were joined by other significant participants such as Sats Ventures and Trust Machines, among others. The involvement of investors like Trust Machines is particularly noteworthy. Trust Machines is a company focused on building on the Bitcoin network, highlighting a strategic interest in foundational infrastructure that enhances Bitcoin’s capabilities and security. The participation of such focused investors suggests that they see Asigna’s technology as a key component in the future development and secure use of Bitcoin and its layer-2 ecosystem. While the press release did not disclose the specific intended use of the funds, seed funding typically supports key areas essential for a startup’s growth: Expanding the engineering and development team to build out the platform’s features. Investing in security audits and infrastructure to ensure the vault’s integrity. Developing marketing and sales efforts to reach potential users (individuals, businesses, institutions). Exploring integrations with more layer-2 protocols and ecosystem partners. This capital infusion provides Asigna with the resources needed to accelerate its development roadmap and bring its smart multisig technology to a wider audience. Boosting Bitcoin Security for a Decentralized Future The core value proposition of Asigna lies in enhancing Bitcoin Security . For many users, managing a single private key is a significant responsibility and risk. Losing the key means losing access to funds permanently. A single point of failure also makes users vulnerable to hacking or theft if their key is compromised. Multisig significantly mitigates these risks. By requiring multiple keys, held by different individuals or stored in different locations, it becomes much harder for a single point of failure to result in loss. This is particularly valuable for: Joint Accounts: Families or partners can require multiple signatures for spending. Business Treasuries: Companies can require multiple executives to approve transactions, preventing single-person fraud or errors. Inheritance Planning: Keys can be distributed among trusted parties to ensure funds can be accessed if the primary owner is incapacitated or deceased. Decentralized Organizations (DAOs): Community members can collectively manage funds through multisig voting mechanisms. Asigna’s focus on ‘smart’ multisig suggests they are building features that go beyond basic multi-signature requirements, potentially automating certain processes or adding conditional logic that further strengthens security and control for these complex use cases. Integrating this technology with layer-2 solutions means that as more value and activity shift to these faster networks, the underlying security infrastructure is already in place. The Power of Non-Custodial Control A defining characteristic of the Asigna Platform is its commitment to being Non-Custodial . This is a critical concept in the cryptocurrency space and directly relates to security and user control. A custodial service is one where a third party holds your private keys on your behalf. Examples include centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. While convenient, this means you do not have direct control over your funds; you are trusting the custodian to keep your keys safe and allow you access when you request it. If the custodian is hacked, goes bankrupt, or freezes your account, your funds are at risk. In contrast, a Non-Custodial solution like Asigna ensures that the user retains control of their private keys at all times. Asigna provides the software and framework for setting up and managing the multisig vault, but they do not hold any of the keys required to spend the Bitcoin. This aligns with the core ethos of Bitcoin – empowering individuals with direct control over their financial assets without relying on intermediaries. The challenge with non-custodial solutions, especially multisig, has historically been complexity. Setting up and managing multiple keys, understanding the backup procedures, and coordinating signatures can be daunting for average users. Platforms like Asigna aim to simplify this process, making the benefits of non-custodial multisig more accessible while still preserving the user’s ultimate control over their keys and funds. This balance between security, control, and usability is key to driving broader adoption. What’s Next for Asigna? Navigating Challenges and Opportunities With the successful Crypto Funding round complete, Asigna is positioned to accelerate its development and market penetration. The capital infusion allows them to invest heavily in technology, talent, and user experience. Potential future developments could include expanding the range of supported layer-2 protocols, adding more advanced ‘smart’ features to the vaults, developing partnerships within the Bitcoin ecosystem, and enhancing the platform’s usability to onboard more users. However, challenges remain. Educating users about the importance and mechanics of multisig and non-custodial solutions is an ongoing effort. Ensuring the platform remains secure against sophisticated attacks is paramount. Furthermore, competition in the Bitcoin infrastructure space is growing, requiring Asigna to differentiate itself effectively. Despite these challenges, the opportunity is significant. As Bitcoin matures as an asset class, the demand for professional-grade, secure, and user-friendly management tools will only increase. Institutions, corporations, and high-net-worth individuals are increasingly looking for robust ways to hold Bitcoin securely, and solutions like Asigna’s smart multisig vaults are directly addressing this need. The focus on layer-2 also positions them well for the future growth of the Bitcoin network’s transaction capacity and utility. Conclusion: A Step Forward for Bitcoin Security Asigna’s successful $3 million seed funding round marks a notable step forward for the infrastructure supporting Bitcoin Security and management. By focusing on a non-custodial, smart Bitcoin Multisig vault for the base layer and layer-2 protocols, the Asigna Platform is tackling critical needs for enhanced control and protection of digital assets. The significant Crypto Funding secured from reputable investors underscores the perceived value and potential of their solution in the market. As the platform develops, it holds the promise of making advanced, secure Bitcoin management more accessible, contributing to the overall maturity and safety of the Bitcoin ecosystem for individuals and institutions alike.

Here Are the Details","Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev said at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas that artificial intelligence will bring about radical changes in company structures. Robinhood CEO: AI Will Transform Entrepreneurship, “One-Man Companies Like Satoshi” Are Coming According to Tenev, in the near future, “one-person companies” could become the norm thanks to artificial intelligence, just like Bitcoin’s mysterious inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto. Tenev likened this new AI-powered startup model to Nakamoto single-handedly creating Bitcoin. “We’re going to see more one-person companies. They’re going to be tokenized and traded on the blockchain, just like any other asset,” he said. “So it’s going to be possible to invest economically in a person or a project that that person is running.” “This is essentially like Bitcoin itself,” Tenev said, “Satoshi Nakamoto’s personal brand is powered by technology.” “Artificial intelligence will add more value with fewer resources” There have been suggestions for years that AI will simplify how companies operate. But Tenev focused on the opportunities it provides for entrepreneurs rather than its potential to replace the workforce. “One of the things that AI makes possible is that it produces more and more value with fewer and fewer resources,” he said. Bitcoin, which was founded with the technical document published by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, quickly produced a global digital economy. This adventure, which began with the mining of the first block in 2009, has today turned into a trillion-dollar crypto asset industry. Blockchain technology is now being used not only in financial transactions but also in many areas such as supply chain tracking, tokenization of digital artworks, and in-game assets. For example, Walmart is using blockchain to increase traceability in its supply chain. Robinhood is a trading platform where users can buy and sell stocks, commodities, and cryptocurrencies. The company has stepped up its crypto activities in recent years; its platform trades a variety of cryptocurrencies as well as memecoins. Tenev's statements strengthened expectations that artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies could combine to usher in a new era in entrepreneurship. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-28T07:55:13.000Z,"Week in GameFi: Bitcoin Hits All-Time High, But Web3 Gaming Misses the Momentum","Although Bitcoin grabbed the attention this week with a stunning surge past $112,000, there has been little fanfare for the GameFi sector. Despite an overall bullish sentiment now pulsating through the crypto markets, Web3 gaming assets have had a hard time keeping up. Trading volumes have tanked, and a couple of recent scandals have raised some eyebrows. All in all, the week was a pretty stark reminder of how up and down the GameFi world is right now. Bitcoin Breaks Records, GameFi Barely Reacts The broader cryptocurrency landscape could hardly have been more favorable. Waves of optimism washed around the digital asset space in the wake of Bitcoin’s all-time high close to $112K. Yet GameFi—a sector long associated with the speculative altcoin cycles—barely stirred in response to the recent Bitcoin rally. Ecosystem tokens across the Web3 gaming space saw only a modest 4 percent uptick, while worries mounted that trading volumes had plummeted by 22 percent—a sign, perhaps, that the lack of retail and institutional enthusiasm for gaming tokens might continue to hold the ecosystem back, even as capital floods into the broader market. Even the CMC Altcoin Index, a barometer of altcoin sector performance, crept up just a single point, moving from 27 to 28. The lack of movement illustrates a larger stagnation within the altcoin ecosystem, with GameFi especially struggling. DeFiLlama reports that GameFi has fallen in sector narrative rankings from 13th to 14th, which indicates that interest and influence in GameFi has continued to wane. Guild of Guardians Defies the Trend with Triple-Digit Gains Although most of the GameFi sector stayed gloomy, Guild of Guardians (GOG) pulled off an unbelievable feat. The token shot up a staggering 286 percent over the week, easily leaving its peers in the dust and obviously being the top performer in the gaming category. The surge has once more brought attention to GOG’s gameplay model and future roadmap, though one has to question whether it can keep delivering. A handful of other undertakings also eluded the prevailing pessimistic atmosphere: MASK: up to 40 percent OL: up 27 percent VIRTUALS: increased by 17 percent. Week in GameFi: Web3 Gaming Misses the BTC Boost BTC breaks $112K! But GameFi stays lukewarm! GOG soars 286%! Trading volumes plunge 22%! Let’s unpack what went down in the Web3 gaming world this week. pic.twitter.com/EhP4dHNO8m — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) May 26, 2025 Nevertheless, some were not so fortunate. Steering gains, NEXPACE, which led the previous week, reversed course and dropped 21 percent as traders rotated capital into newer opportunities. This signals and suggests for investors that GameFi is not as stable as it may seem. A lead kind of capital you can control like Grayscale won’t guarantee a rise in GameFi tokens. And that may indicate for investors that GameFi is not as stable a sector as one might have thought. These stark reversals and single-project supremacy showcase GameFi’s present vulnerability — where victories are dispersed, and overall industry sentiment is still lackluster. Scandals and Slow Rebuilds Undermine Confidence GameFi also received unwelcome press this week with the arrest of Vladimir Smerkis, co-founder of Blum, on charges stemming from large-scale financial fraud involving earlier ventures. Blum was quick to clarify that Smerkis does not work for them anymore, but the reputational hit is likely to stick. Whether potential investors or new users are thinking about the gaming aspect or the financial aspect of GameFi, news like this makes them question whether the whole thing is worth their time and money. In the meantime, platforms are busily restoring trust and engagement. WEMIX, a foremost GameFi project, took a significant step toward reactivating its user base and regaining momentum after a high-profile hack earlier this year by unveiling a new Mission System. In a different part of the Web3 world, BOXCAT announced not long ago that it would debut on Gate.io, giving an airdrop to holders of the exchange’s GT token—a modest but tokenomic effort to boost initial traction. These developments might not propel markets in overnight manners, but they do signal a rebuilding phase for GameFi. After the recent explosive growth and the speculative hype that accompanied it, many GameFi platforms seem to be returning to fundamentals. They are focusing on community engagement, platform security, and gradual ecosystem expansion. While Bitcoin’s command of the headlines and capital expressing itself in the GameFi domain, GameFi finds itself at a bit of a crossroads. The muted sector reaction to a record-breaking week in crypto amplifies the clarity of the situation: Challenges lie ahead, challenges that, if met successfully, lead to a destination called User Trust and Interest That is Not Just Hype. What the market wants to see now is proof that Web3 games can deliver actual lasting value. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-05-28T07:47:27.000Z,"Solana Leads in Capital Inflows Despite Declining Activity as Chain Competition Intensifies","May has been a month of mixed blessings for Solana . While the network saw a major inflow from centralized exchanges, to the tune of $1.1 billion—that’s the most since 2024; its on-chain transaction activity keep declining. Now, two key things here: 1. The inflow is a sign that investor interest is on the uptick, at least. 2. The fact that transaction activity on the chain is going down in spite of this inflow signals a divergence between investor interest and network utility that is rarely seen. BREAKING: @Solana saw an inflow of $1.1 billion from centralized exchanges in May alone, the largest monthly inflow since 2024. pic.twitter.com/Fh9eIZkBIx — SolanaFloor (@SolanaFloor) May 27, 2025 And from where I’m sitting, that ain’t great. Solana Sees Historic Inflows Amid Transaction Decline In May, Solana drew in an astonishing $1.1 billion in capital from centralized exchanges, cementing its status as a go-to blockchain for institutions and retail investors. This figure represents the highest monthly inflow recorded since 2024 and occurs during a period when the entire crypto sector seems to be favoring high-throughput, low-fee chains. Even with this strong indication, Solana’s transaction volumes tell another tale. Per the data of OKX Explorer covering May 18 to 24, Solana carried out 2.37 billion transactions, down 8.24 percent week-over-week. This was the third week in a row of Solana having less “activity.” Even though this statement does not carry a good connotation, it does not make Solana’s numbers look bad at all. In fact, the number of raw transactions that Solana handles is vastly greater than those of competing chains. And even with these “bad” numbers, Solana is still a blockchain that you would want to be a part of. This divergence raises some big issues. Is it the case that users are becoming less active at the same time that capital is rushing into the ecosystem? We could be looking at something totally normal and healthy, with all this new money speculating on the ecosystem, in anticipation of upcoming applications or market catalysts—rather than something that’s representative of any sort of growth in everyday usage of Solana right now. On the flip side, if this new money is representative of actual new use cases for Solana, then where are all these new users of upcoming applications participating in Solana’s ongoing speculative economy? Competitors Catching Up as Solana’s Grip Weakens While Solana’s on-chain activity is decreasing, other blockchain networks are getting more active. The standout is clearly BNB Chain, which saw 53 million transactions last week—up 5.36 percent from the prior week. This was its third consecutive week of positive growth, with transaction activity rising 54 percent, then 2 percent, and now another 5 percent. BNB’s Chains steady climb should be interpreted as a rise in user engagement, which might be driven by DeFi applications, token launches, or the still-growing number of Binance-led initiatives. Polygon also had a strong showing, amassing 24.7 million transactions and vaulting 9.31 percent over the week. That comes on the heels of a three-week run totaling an 18 percent increase, putting Polygon atop the mid-tier performer ranking. Top 8 Chains by Weekly Total Txn OKX Explorer | May 18-24 Weekly Trends: @solana : 2.37B (-8.24% WoW) — Drop for 3 consecutive weeks; dominance erodes further. @fractal_bitcoin : 91.8M (-7.82% WoW ) — Volatility spikes after +2% rebound last week, but still holding a… pic.twitter.com/ACzNJYSYPb — OKX Explorer (@okxexplorer) May 27, 2025 Its low fees, along with its compatibility with Ethereum-based tools, keep developers and users piling into the ecosystem, with that flood largely dominated by the gaming and NFT sectors. At the same time, Base—the Ethereum Layer 2 created by Coinbase—had 59.3 million transactions but a 5.95 percent drop. This marked the halt of a five-week growth streak and may have signaled the beginning of a short-term correction. Base is still new, and this is a relatively calm period for it, which is tied closely to the destiny of Coinbase and what it decides to integrate and do in the future. Broader Ecosystem Faces Volatility and Fluctuation Other notable chains experienced similar conditions. Fractal Bitcoin, a volume-driven but not particularly “run-of-the-mill” platform, executed 91.8 million trades—a 7.82 percent drop after a minor rebound the prior week that hardly deserves mentioning. Even with that close-to-static status, Fractal Bitcoin retained its total-ahead-of-totals status versus Solana by remaining a stricter rule-following platform. Thus, among second-tier platforms, Fractal Bitcoin seems the most likely candidate for a kind of “pause that refreshed” scenario. Sui Network and Aptos, two younger Layer 1 blockchains, both continued to have some headwinds. Sui dropped another 2.87 percent in weekly transaction count, bringing its three-week decline to 9 percent. Aptos remained mostly flat at 26 million transactions, offering very little indication of renewed momentum after a brief stabilization phase. Tron also saw a setback hit it, with its 24.7 million weekly transactions coming in at an 8.05 percent drop. This netted out the week-before gains, and in the end, it highlighted the erratic nature of user activity on old, high-throughput chains. Even though transaction activity is down, inflows to Solana are at an all-time high. This must mean that there is still confidence in the Solana network, and confidence in it as a long-term vehicle for value. Solana is up against some stiff competition, though. The performance of not just Solana but all Layer 1 networks will be closely scrutinized in the coming weeks to see if they can maintain their upswell of interest and not just be faddish at the Layer 1 level while Layer 2 is winning the competitive race.

2025-05-28T07:43:33.000Z,"Bitcoin cements its haven asset reputation. Is the “means of exchange” narrative still alive?","Bitcoin has always been compared to gold. As time went by, the safe haven reputation of Bitcoin only strengthened. However, Bitcoin was conceived as an alternative cash system, and Bitcoin enthusiasts still greet businesses that have started accepting bitcoins. What are the chances that Bitcoin will eventually become a regular means of exchange? Safe haven assets: Bitcoin and gold Gold has been recognized as a safe haven for a long time, meaning that it successfully preserves value in times of financial turbulence, serving as a strong hedge against inflation. Bitcoin, sometimes referred to as digital gold, is something new in this regard. Multiple investors and financial experts went so far as to call Bitcoin a better version of gold. Both assets are scarce and hard to produce. Gold is finite, and Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million, most of which is already in circulation and around three million are lost forever. As for the advantages of Bitcoin over gold, cryptocurrency is extremely easy to manage. Gold bars need special storage. Maintenance of gold bars is demanding and costly. More than that, gold needs space. Bitcoin is much more comfortable as you may always have it with you as long as you obtain a seed phrase of your wallet or private and public keys. Bitcoin can be stored in a trustless manner. For gold, you will probably have to trust professionals. Sending gold is way harder and more expensive than sending a Bitcoin transaction. Another characteristic that makes Bitcoin way different from gold is value dynamics. Bitcoin has an element of gambling to it, as its price is pretty volatile. However, as institutional investors and governments are joining the hunt for Bitcoin, the price stabilizes without losing its upward direction. Many say that this cycle will be different from the previous ones, meaning that major ups and downs of Bitcoin will probably become a thing of the past. Read more: 2025 is no longer about cycles — Bitcoin is reading something else entirely Gold has a long-term price appreciation, too, and does not have the volatility of Bitcoin. More than that, during the economic turmoil triggered by Donald Trump’s tariff policies, gold spiked immensely, not Bitcoin. It signals that investors trust gold more than Bitcoin. Gold slipped after Trump softened EU tariff threats — a reminder that its haven status now bends to politics. Meanwhile, $BTC held steady amid rising deficits, rating downgrades, and macro chaos (even touching new ATH's along the way) Is Bitcoin the new flight to safety? — Bitcoin.com News (@BTCTN) May 26, 2025 One of the reasons behind gold’s strength is that its price doesn’t correlate with the stock market movements but rather grows slowly and intensifies when people expect hard times. Bitcoin is tied to stock prices more clearly. Finally, gold is familiar to most people and leans to more established regulations. Uncertainty in Bitcoin regulation is turning some of the potential investors away. Bitcoin as a means of exchange While some insist that Bitcoin is not good for payments but great as a savings currency, many in the crypto community argue that Bitcoin derives its value from being used as a means of exchange. In 2021, Tesla made a revolutionary step when it announced that its vehicles could be purchased for Bitcoin. However, soon after, the company withdrew its decision, citing the environmental impact of Bitcoin as the reason. In the U.S., many big and small businesses accept Bitcoin. Notable examples are Apple, Microsoft, Starbucks, PayPal, Netflix, and many others. https://twitter.com/Sina_21st/status/1925639079380545849?t=l8gtykYOZT0FISuY3QYiEg&s=35 However, despite various advantages, Bitcoin’s use as a means of exchange is limited by a relatively small share of merchants accepting BTC. According to Bitdegree, Bitcoin is accepted by 15,000 businesses around the world, of which over 2,000 are based in the U.S. On top of that, the network capacity of Bitcoin is too small for a means of exchange used by the masses. It can process only up to seven transactions per second. For comparison, Visa is capable of processing over 65,000 transactions per second. It is accepted in over 46 million merchant locations. Nevertheless, the Bitcoin community was never going to get over it. For years, developers have been working on solutions to scale Bitcoin up for higher adoption as a means of exchange. The most well-known project aimed at solving Bitcoin’s scalability issues is Lightning Network. LN is a layer-2 protocol that enables fast and cheap transactions using off-chain transactions for this purpose. Surprisingly, even the name of the smallest denomination of Bitcoin became the battleground within the crypto community. Originally, the one hundred-millionth particle of Bitcoin was called Satoshi (or sats), after Satoshi Nakamoto, a mysterious creator of Bitcoin. A new proposal suggests that the name “bits” will fit better. Prepaid crypto debit cards are moving Bitcoin spending forward. They allow clients to hold BTC right on the banking card and spend it anywhere where the cards are accepted. Bitcoins are turned into fiat money automatically and exchanged. As prepaid cryptocurrency cards continue to occur and more businesses jump on the Bitcoin train, BTC will become an easier choice as a means of exchange. However, its role as capital or savings money will persist.

2025-05-28T07:40:30.000Z,"Two crypto investors charged with kidnapping and torturing a man for his Bitcoin password","Police have apprehended two crypto investors who were allegedly involved in the kidnapping and torturing of an Italian man in a Manhattan townhouse. The victim claimed his captors forced him to reveal his Bitcoin account password. According to a recent report by AP News, 32-year-old William Duplessie has surrendered to the police over the alleged kidnapping of a man who claimed he was tortured for weeks in a posh New York townhouse by crypto investors seeking to extort his Bitcoin ( BTC ) funds. Duplessie is the second alleged culprit to be apprehended by the police. He faces charges of kidnapping, assault, unlawful imprisonment and criminal possession of a weapon. His accomplice, fellow crypto investor John Woeltz, was taken into custody four days earlier after the victim managed to escape their grasp. Duplessie is known online as the co-founder and head of sourcing at Pangea Blockchain Fund and an avid investor in blockchain firms. While Woeltz has described himself as a blockchain investor who spent time in Silicon Valley before becoming involved in the crypto mining sector in Kentucky. On May 23, a 28-year-old Italian man found by a traffic agent at the side of the road. Bloodied and barefoot, the victim claimed to have been beaten, drugged, shocked with electricity and threatened with death for nearly three weeks in an eight-bedroom townhouse located in Soho, Manhattan. According to the police, the victim was lured to the townhouse by Duplessie and Woeltz on May 6. The two crypto investors allegedly attempted to extort the man to give up his Bitcoin account password.

Believing he would be killed soon if he did not comply to their demands, the victim agreed on Friday morning to reveal his Bitcoin account password to the captors. When the two men went to get the victim’s computer, the victim managed to escape from the home. He is currently hospitalized for his injuries that appeared consistent with the evidence authorities found in the Manhattan townhouse.

Five commissioners are supposed to make up the CFTC, and no more than three can be from the same political party.Goldsmith Romero said that during her tenure, all the commissioners had different perspectives and experiences that, when brought together, were “really helpful.”“So what happens if the CFTC gets down to one and gets new authority for crypto? It’s going to be really, really hard; you’re not going to have the same push and pull,” she said.The Trump administration has floated the idea of handing the reins of crypto regulation to the CFTC in the past. Congressional Republicans have also been drafting bills to give the CFTC greater oversight over the industry, Retail customer Definition should be CFTC priority In the future, Goldsmith Romero thinks the CFTC should work on defining a retail customer to ensure the influx of fresh investments in “crypto and some other products” has a similar retail customer protection regime to the Securities and Exchange Commission.Related: Crypto perp futures coming ‘very soon,’ says CFTC’s Mersinger“I came from the SEC with an investor protection regime, you want people to know their rights and risk if they take a risk and they lose that’s on them,” she said.“But you want to have some basic things like exchanges that are registered that have some basic requirements and have to follow the law and this is, I think, the main thing that needs to happen.”Goldsmith Romero said other “extremely basic” rules could include a ban against co-mingling a company’s assets with customer funds, and brokers, exchanges and clearing houses being required to register with the SEC, the CFTC or in some cases, both.Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/goldsmith-romero-cf-exodus-not-a-great-situation?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The legislative text is focused on putting forward a regulatory framework in which we can enforce actions to strengthen this broader market, in particular to the benefit of American consumers and innovation and development here.”Democratic Senator Marker Warner voiced a similar sentiment before the GENIUS Act passed on May 19, stating that the US couldn’t “afford to keep standing on the sidelines” while the crypto industry evolves.“We cannot allow that corruption to blind us to the broader reality: blockchain technology is here to stay,” Warner said. “If American lawmakers don’t shape it, others will — and not in ways that serve our interests or democratic values.”Steil credits DemocratsSteil acknowledged that Democratic lawmakers have made an effort to better understand the crypto industry’s gripes with how the Biden administration handled regulation and enforcement of the sector.He said the political landscape and nature of crypto-related negotiations “looked a little different,” but over 70 Democrats in the last Congress signaled the need for clear crypto rules when the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) passed the House in May 2024.Related: Trump supports bill to buy 1 million BTC — Senator Lummis“I think that was a great practice run,” said Steil.The FIT21 Act wasn’t enacted before the end of the last Congress However, House Agricultural and Financial Services Committee chairs Glenn Thompson and French Hill introduced a new crypto market structure bill on May 5 that aims to build on FIT21.If lawmakers pass those bills, they will have the opportunity to explore a lot of other “interesting, creative ideas” in the space, Steil said.Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside storyAdditional reporting by Turner Wright",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/steil-wants-lawmakers-restrain-adding-non-relevant-items-crypto-bills?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-28T02:11:48.000Z,"Real-world assets could revitalize dying NFT lending market: DappRadar","Real-world assets linking up with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is one of a few key catalysts that could reignite the waning NFT lending sector, which is suffering from a collapse in volumes and user activity, says blockchain analytics platform DappRadar.Volumes in the NFT lending market, which allows NFT holders to take out a loan against their token, have dropped 97% from a peak of around $1 billion in January 2024 to $50 million in May, DappRadar analyst Sara Gherghelas said in a May 27 report.Gherghelas said for NFT lending to “move beyond survival mode,” it needs “new catalysts” to reignite the sector, such as real-world asset NFTs, like tokenized real estate or yield-bearing assets that could unlock more stable, trusted collateral sources.“So far, 2025 has not delivered a compelling reason for NFT lending to bounce back,” she said. “While the infrastructure is still here and the platforms remain active, activity has slowed across the board.” Borrower and leading activity have taken a big hit in the NFT lending sector. Source: DappRadar“For now, the sector seems to be in a holding pattern, waiting either for market recovery or a new use case to reignite interest.”Gherghelas added that other catalysts that could rekindle NFT lending were tools that make it easier for NFT holders to borrow against their tokens, and that protocols should create “smart infrastructure” such as undercollateralized loans, credit scores and artificial intelligence risk matching.The report adds that since January last year, borrower activity has declined by 90% and those willing to lend have shrunk by 78%.The average NFT loan size has also taken a hit from a peak of $22,000 in 2022 to $4,000 in May, a 71% year-over-year drop.Gherghelas said this shift “shows that either users are borrowing against lower-value assets or simply becoming more conservative with leverage.”NFT lending overall trading volume and market activity have dropped off from the all-time highs of past years. Source: DappRadarThe average loan duration is also lower; after hitting an average of roughly 40 days in 2023, it’s been down to 31 days and has held steady throughout 2024 and into 2025.Gherghelas said this could indicate that “loans are being taken more frequently but for shorter periods, perhaps a sign of more tactical liquidity plays.”NFT ﻿market downturn also hurts lendingPart of the slowdown in NFT lending is connected to the overall NFT market decline, which has seen volumes drop 61% in the first quarter to $1.5 billion compared to $4.1 billion a year ago.“With collateral value collapsing, the lending activity naturally followed,” Gherghelas said. “There are a few exceptions that managed to hold or regain traction, but they’ve been outliers, not enough to lift the sector.”Related: AI decentralized apps are coming for the Web3 throne: DappRadarThe protocol landscape has also narrowed, and the number of active NFT lending apps is limited, with only eight protocols holding any meaningful share.“The flip-for-liquidity model that worked during bull markets isn’t built for a quieter, more risk-averse environment. But that doesn’t mean NFT lending is finished; it’s simply shifting focus,” Gherghelas said.“Platforms are diversifying, use cases are shifting, and collateral preferences are changing. If the next wave builds on utility, culture, and better design, NFT lending might just find its second wind — one built to last.”Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/real-world-assets-revitalize-dying-nft-lending-dappradar?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

SharpLink will invest $425 million to acquire 120,000 ETH. Ethereum futures open interest hits an all-time high of $36.1 billion, with ETH price climbing 4.5% on the daily chart. Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming (SBET) announced a $425 million private investment in public equity (PIPE), acquiring approximately 69.1 million shares at $6.15 each to establish the first Nasdaq-listed Ethereum (ETH) treasury company.Spearheaded by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, this move mirrors Strategy’s (MSTR) successful Bitcoin treasury strategy, which has yielded over $8.2 billion in gains in 2025, by leveraging stock and bond sales to acquire BTC.Former Ethereum core developer and contributor Eric Conner highlighted the bullish implications of SharpLink’s move, noting its potential to create a “public ETH proxy for funds that can’t hold tokens directly.” Conner emphasized that the acquisition of 120,000 ETH—likely to be staked—could lead to “supply compression” by removing tokens from circulation. The Ether proponent also pointed to the “new narrative fuel” this provides, positioning ETH as a “digital reserve collateral” and potentially driving its adoption on mainstream balance sheets through an equity wrapper like $SBET.However, crypto analyst VICTOR cautioned against over-enthusiasm, outlining the risk of leveraging gains from an altcoin still down 19% in 2025. In Q1 2025, Cointelegraph reported a sharp decline in Ethereum network fees, dropping to $605,000 from $2.5 million in just two weeks in March, alongside a noticeable decrease in decentralized app (DApp) activity.

The majority of these rallies—eight out of ten—resulted in negative returns, while one rally triggered a short squeeze, driving prices higher, and another displayed neutral price action.From a technical perspective, Ether’s price action on the daily chart posted a descending triangle, a bullish breakout pattern, which creates equal highs and higher lows, converging toward an imminent rally. The pattern is bordered by two trendlines, the upper resistance, currently around $2,700 and the ascending support line. A bullish breakout above $2,677 targets the pattern’s measured move, calculated by adding the triangle’s height to the breakout point.

Speaking at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, Sigel said the most viable path forward may involve inserting Bitcoin mining incentives into the congressional budget reconciliation process.According to Sigel, the most effective path to growing a US strategic Bitcoin reserve would be through targeted amendments to congressional budget legislation. These could include tax credits for mining companies that use methane gas and other incentives aimed at encouraging miners to share a portion of their mined BTC with the federal government. He argued that such an approach would allow the reserve to grow organically over time. Sigel also highlighted the limitations of executive actions in achieving this goal:\""The problem with executive action is that it's going to prompt lawsuits. And anything over $100 million is going to get sued by the Elizabeth Warrens of the world. So, I would say start with something maybe in the Exchange Stabilization Fund for $100 million.\""US President Donald Trump established the US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve through a March 7 executive order.

FalconX, a digital asset broker, said it secured a facility worth over $100 million as part of a “broader credit framework,” while Maple Finance reportedly closed the first tranche of an agreement with Cantor.The service allows companies holding Bitcoin to borrow funds and use the cryptocurrency as collateral, providing a way to unlock liquidity without selling their BTC holdings.

At the time, the company said Anchorage Digital and Copper would serve as custodians and collateral managers in the venture.Credit markets are a fundamental part of the financial system, allowing capital to flow between borrowers and lenders and supporting economic activity across sectors.

Bitcoin’s bullish momentum aligns with the favorable US financial conditions, as noted by Ecoinometrics. The macroeconomic-focused Bitcoin newsletter highlighted that the National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) shows a rapid shift to ultra-loose territory after a tightening phase in February 2025. The NFCI, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, tracks stress in the financial system by aggregating measures like credit spreads, leverage, and funding conditions. When the index moves into looser territory, it reflects easier access to capital and reduced market stress—conditions that typically encourage risk-taking behavior among investors. For high-beta assets like Bitcoin, such periods often coincide with price rallies as capital flows into speculative markets.US National Financial Conditions Index.

It’s tracking the same pattern we saw since 2023: easing conditions → capital rotation → risk-on.”With Bitcoin just 2% away from its all-time high price, data from CoinGlass indicates that the probability of a short-squeeze remains high due to significant sell-side liquidity.

2025-05-27T15:40:00.000Z,"93% of all Bitcoin is already mined. Here’s what that means","How much Bitcoin is left to mine?              Bitcoin’s total supply is hardcoded at 21 million BTC, a fixed upper limit that cannot be altered without a consensus-breaking change to the protocol. This finite cap is enforced at the protocol level and is central to Bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset.As of May 2025, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoin (BTC) have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created, and those remaining coins will be mined very slowly.The reason for this uneven distribution is Bitcoin’s exponential issuance schedule, governed by an event called the halving. When Bitcoin launched in 2009, the block reward was 50 BTC. Every 210,000 blocks — or approximately every four years — that reward is cut in half. Because the early rewards were so large, over 87% of the total supply was mined by the end of 2020. Each subsequent halving sharply reduces the rate of new issuance, meaning it will take over a century to mine the remaining 6.7%.According to current estimates, 99% of all Bitcoin will have been mined by 2035, but the final fraction — the last satoshis — won’t be produced until around the year 2140 due to the nature of geometric reward reduction.This engineered scarcity, combined with an immutable supply cap, is what draws comparisons between Bitcoin and physical commodities like gold. But Bitcoin is even more predictable: Gold’s supply grows at around 1.7% annually, whereas Bitcoin’s issuance rate is transparently declining.Did you know? Bitcoin’s supply curve is not terminal in the traditional sense. It follows an asymptotic trajectory — a kind of economic Zeno’s paradox — where rewards diminish indefinitely but never truly reach zero. Mining will continue until around 2140, by which point over 99.999% of the total 21 million BTC will have been issued.                  Beyond the supply cap: How lost coins make Bitcoin scarcer than you think              While over 93% of Bitcoin’s total supply has been mined, that doesn’t mean it’s all available. A significant portion is permanently out of circulation, lost due to forgotten passwords, misplaced wallets, destroyed hard drives or early adopters who never touched their coins again.Estimates from firms like Chainalysis and Glassnode suggest that between 3.0 million and 3.8 million BTC — roughly 14%-18% of the total supply — is likely gone for good. That includes high-profile dormant addresses like the one believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, which alone holds over 1.1 million BTC.This means Bitcoin’s true circulating supply may be closer to 16 million-17 million, not 21 million. And because Bitcoin is non-recoverable by design, any lost coins stay lost — permanently reducing supply over time.Now compare that to gold. Around 85% of the world’s total gold supply has been mined — approximately 216,265 metric tons, according to the World Gold Council — but nearly all of it remains in circulation or held in vaults, jewelry, ETFs and central banks. Gold can be remelted and reused; Bitcoin cannot be resurrected once access is lost.This distinction gives Bitcoin a kind of hardening scarcity, a supply that not only stops growing over time but quietly shrinks.As Bitcoin matures, it’s entering a monetary phase similar to gold: low issuance, high holder concentration and increasing demand-side sensitivity. But Bitcoin takes it further; its supply cap is hard, its loss rate is permanent, and its distribution is publicly auditable.This may lead to several outcomes:Increased price volatility as available supply becomes more limited and sensitive to market demandHigher long-term value concentration in the hands of those who remain active and secure in their key managementA premium on liquidity, where actually spendable BTC trades at a higher effective value than dormant supply.In extreme cases, this could produce a bifurcation between “circulating BTC” and “unreachable BTC,” with the former gaining greater economic significance, particularly in times of constrained exchange liquidity or macroeconomic stress.                  What happens when Bitcoin is fully mined?              There’s a popular assumption that as Bitcoin’s block rewards shrink, the network’s security will eventually suffer. But in practice, the mining economy is far more adaptive — and much more resilient — than that.Bitcoin’s mining incentives are governed by a self-correcting feedback loop: If mining becomes unprofitable, miners drop off the network, which in turn triggers a difficulty adjustment. Every 2,016 blocks (roughly every two weeks), the network recalibrates mining difficulty using a parameter known as nBits. The goal is to keep block times steady at around 10 minutes, regardless of how many miners are competing.So, if Bitcoin’s price drops, or the reward becomes too small relative to operating costs, inefficient miners simply exit. This causes difficulty to fall, lowering the cost for those who remain. The result is a system that continually rebalances itself, aligning network participation with available incentives.This mechanism has already been tested at scale. After China banned mining in mid-2021, Bitcoin’s global hashrate dropped by more than 50% in a matter of weeks. Yet the network continued to function without interruption, and within a few months, the hashrate fully recovered, as miners resumed operations in jurisdictions with lower energy costs and more favorable regulations.Critically, the idea that lower rewards will inherently threaten network security overlooks how mining is tied to profit margins, not nominal BTC amounts. As long as the market price supports the cost of hash power — even at 0.78125 BTC per block (post-2028 halving) or lower — miners will continue to secure the network.In other words, it’s not the absolute reward that matters, but whether mining remains profitable relative to costs. And thanks to Bitcoin’s built-in difficulty adjustment, it usually does.Even a century from now, when the block reward approaches zero, the network will likely still be protected by whatever combination of fees, base incentives and infrastructure efficiency exists at that time. But that’s a distant concern. In the meantime, the current system — hashrate adjusts, difficulty rebalances, miners adapt — remains one of the most robust elements of Bitcoin’s design.Did you know? On April 20, 2024, following the launch of the Runes protocol, Bitcoin miners earned over $80 million in transaction fees within a single day, surpassing the $26 million earned from block rewards. This marked the first time in Bitcoin’s history that transaction fees alone exceeded the block subsidy in daily miner revenue.                  The future of Bitcoin mining: Energy consumption              It’s a common misconception that rising Bitcoin prices will drive endless energy use. In reality, mining is constrained by profitability, not price alone.As block rewards shrink, miners are pushed toward thinner margins, and that means chasing the cheapest, cleanest energy available. Since China’s 2021 mining ban, hashrate has migrated to regions like North America and Northern Europe, where operators tap into surplus hydro, wind and underutilized grid energy.According to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, between 52% and 59% of Bitcoin mining now runs on renewables or low-emission sources. Regulations are reinforcing this trend, with several jurisdictions offering incentives for clean-powered mining or penalizing fossil-fuel operations.Moreover, the idea that higher BTC prices will always mean higher energy use misses how Bitcoin self-regulates: More miners raise difficulty, which compresses margins, capping energy expansion. Renewable-based mining brings its own challenges, but the dystopian future of endlessly expanding fossil-fueled hash power is increasingly unlikely.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/93-of-all-bitcoin-is-already-mined-heres-what-that-means?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T15:00:00.000Z,"ZKPs can prove I&#039;m old enough without telling you my age","Opinion by: Andre Omietanski, General Counsel, and Amal Ibraymi, Legal Counsel at Aztec LabsWhat if you could prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthday, name, or anything else at all? Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) make this hypothetical a reality and solve one of the key challenges online: verifying age without sacrificing privacy. The need for better age verification todayWe're witnessing an uptick in laws being proposed restricting minors' access to social media and the internet, including in Australia, Florida, and China. To protect minors from inappropriate adult content, platform owners and governments often walk a tightrope between inaction and overreach. For example, the state of Louisiana in the US recently enacted a law meant to block minors from viewing porn. Sites required users to upload an ID before viewing content. The Free Speech Coalition challenged the law as unconstitutional, making the case that it infringed on First Amendment rights. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed on procedural grounds. The reaction, however, highlights the dilemma facing policymakers and platforms: how to block minors without violating adults' rights or creating new privacy risks.Traditional age verification failsCurrent age verification tools are either ineffective or invasive. Self-declaration is meaningless, since users can simply lie about their age. ID-based verification is overly invasive. No one should be required to upload their most sensitive documents, putting themselves at risk of data breaches and identity theft. Biometric solutions like fingerprints and face scans are convenient for users but raise important ethical, privacy, and security concerns. Biometric systems are not always accurate and may generate false positives and negatives. The irreversible nature of the data, which can't be changed like a regular password can, is also less than ideal. Other methods, like behavioral tracking and AI-driven verification of browser patterns, are also problematic, using machine learning to analyze user interactions and identify patterns and anomalies, raising concerns of a surveillance culture.ZKPs as the privacy-preserving solutionZero-knowledge proofs present a compelling solution. Like a government ID provider, a trusted entity verifies the user's age and generates a cryptographic proof confirming they are over the required age. Websites only need to check the proof, not the excess personal data, ensuring privacy while keeping minors at the gates. No centralized data storage is required, alleviating the burden on platforms such as Google, Meta, and WhatsApp and eliminating the risk of data breaches. Recent: How zero-knowledge proofs can make AI fairerAdopting and enforcing ZKPs at scaleZKPs aren't a silver bullet. They can be complex to implement. The notion of \""don't trust, verify,\"" proven by indisputable mathematics, may cause some regulatory skepticism. Policymakers may hesitate to trust cryptographic proofs over visible ID verification. There are occasions when companies may need to disclose personal information to authorities, such as during an investigation into financial crimes or government inquiries. This would challenge ZKPs, whose very intention is for platforms not to hold this data in the first place.ZKPs also struggle with scalability and performance, being somewhat computationally intensive and tricky to program. Efficient implementation techniques are being explored, and breakthroughs, such as the Noir programming language, are making ZKPs more accessible to developers, driving the adoption of secure, privacy-first solutions. A safer, smarter future for age verificationGoogle's move to adopt ZKPs for age verification is a promising signal that mainstream platforms are beginning to embrace privacy-preserving technologies. But to fully realize the potential of ZKPs, we need more than isolated solutions locked into proprietary ecosystems. Crypto-native wallets can go further. Open-source and permissionless blockchain-based systems offer interoperability, composability, and programmable identity. With a single proof, users can access a range of services across the open web — no need to start from scratch every time, or trust a single provider (Google) with their credentials.ZKPs flip the script on online identity — proving what matters, without exposing anything else. They protect user privacy, help platforms stay compliant, and block minors from restricted content, all without creating new honeypots of sensitive data.Google's adoption of ZKPs shows mainstream momentum is building. But to truly transform digital identity, we must embrace crypto-native, decentralized systems that give users control over what they share and who they are online.In an era defined by surveillance, ZKPs offer a better path forward — one that's secure, private, and built for the future.Opinion by: Andre Omietanski, General Counsel, and Amal Ibraymi, Legal Counsel at Aztec Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-27T14:30:00.000Z,"What is a cryptocurrency mixer and how does it work?","Cryptocurrency mixers explained              A cryptocurrency mixer is a specialized service designed to increase the privacy and anonymity of blockchain transactions. Unlike traditional financial transactions, which are private by default, most cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) operate on public blockchains. This means every transaction is permanently recorded and accessible to anyone, making it possible for blockchain analysts or malicious actors to trace the flow of funds between wallets.A crypto mixer’s primary function is to break the link between the sender’s wallet and the recipient’s wallet. It does so by pooling together coins from many users and then redistributing them in a way that makes it difficult to track which coins went where. Think of it like a digital version of shuffling cards in a deck. After mixing, your cryptocurrency is returned to you or a recipient’s address, but it’s “cleaned” of any direct transaction history.This privacy-enhancing feature is why some people rely on mixers, especially those seeking to keep their financial activities confidential in an open-ledger world.                  How does a crypto mixer work?              To understand a crypto mixer, it’s useful to compare it to the concept of money laundering in traditional finance, albeit with legal and ethical nuances. The process of “mixing” is essentially designed to obscure the origin and destination of coins.Here’s a typical workflow of how a cryptocurrency mixer operates:Deposit: You send your cryptocurrency to the mixer’s wallet address. Multiple users do the same, creating a large pool of coins.Mixing/shuffling: The mixer’s system pools and shuffles these coins together, breaking any visible connection between deposited and withdrawn funds.Redistribution: After mixing, the service sends back an equivalent amount of coins to your specified address, but these aren’t the same coins you deposited. They come from the pooled coins of all participants.Fees: The mixer usually deducts a small fee, generally ranging from 1% to 3%, to cover operational costs.This process effectively disrupts blockchain analysis, making it extremely difficult for anyone to trace the coins back to their original owners.                  Types of cryptocurrency mixers              Not all mixers are created equal. They can broadly be divided into two categories: centralized and decentralized mixers.Centralized mixersCentralized mixers are the most common and operate similarly to traditional services. You send your coins to a company or entity that controls the mixing process, and then they send back “clean” coins after mixing. These services are relatively easy to use, often providing a simple user interface.However, centralized mixers require you to trust the service operator with your coins, at least temporarily. This introduces risks such as:The mixer could be a scam and disappear with your funds.It could be hacked, exposing users’ data and coins.The operator may keep logs that could compromise your privacy.Decentralized mixersDecentralized mixers use blockchain technology and smart contracts to automate the mixing process without a trusted third party. They rely on cryptographic methods such as zero-knowledge proofs to mix coins in a trustless environment. Users pool their coins into a smart contract, which then redistributes coins in a way that ensures privacy.Advantages of decentralized mixers include:No central point of failure or custody risk.Higher privacy because no single party controls the funds.Often more resistant to regulatory crackdowns.Did you know? The DOJ indicted four Russians for operating crypto mixers Blender.io and Sinbad.io, yet failed to show they knowingly laundered illicit funds. The indictment relies heavily on vague forum posts and lacks concrete evidence of criminal intent or ties to US commerce, raising serious doubts about its strength in court.                  Real-world cases involving mixers and scams              Unfortunately, the privacy offered by crypto mixers has also attracted criminals. The very anonymity that protects innocent users can also shield illicit activities, leading to widespread misuse.Crypto mixers have been linked to ransomware attacks, dark web marketplaces, fraud and drug trafficking. Criminals often use these services to “clean” proceeds from illegal transactions and hide their tracks from law enforcement.A notable example is ChipMixer, a service seized by Europol in 2023 for allegedly facilitating money laundering for dark web markets and ransomware groups. Authorities dismantled the platform’s infrastructure over alleged money laundering, seizing four servers, 1,909.4 BTC (about $210 million as of May 26, 2025) and seven TB of data across 55 transactions.Mixers have also been involved in laundering stolen funds from cryptocurrency exchange hacks. The complexity of these transactions makes it difficult for investigators to recover stolen assets.In February 2025, Bybit, a major cryptocurrency exchange, suffered a significant security breach resulting in the theft of about $1.5 billion worth of cryptocurrencies. The attackers, attributed to the Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking organization, employed various crypto mixers, including Wasabi, CryptoMixer, Railgun and Tornado Cash, to launder portions of the stolen assets. Despite efforts to trace the funds, a significant portion remains unaccounted for, highlighting the challenges posed by mixers in cybersecurity investigations.                  Are crypto mixers legal?              The legal status of cryptocurrency mixers depends largely on the jurisdiction and context of their use.Most governments impose strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing regulations on financial services, including digital currency services. Mixers, by their nature, complicate AML compliance because they obscure transaction trails.For instance,In the European Union, the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD) includes digital currency providers under its regulatory scope, requiring them to perform KYC checks and report suspicious activity.In the United States, FinCEN classifies cryptocurrency mixers as money transmitters, requiring registration and compliance with AML regulations. Unlicensed mixers can face severe penalties and criminal charges.Legal uses vs misuseUsing a mixer for privacy reasons is not inherently illegal. However, if mixers are used to launder proceeds from crimes, authorities will prosecute offenders. Similarly, operating a mixer without appropriate licenses or regulatory oversight can be illegal.If you choose to use a mixer, make sure you understand the legal implications in your country and avoid any activity that could be linked to money laundering or fraud.Did you know? Crypto mixer transactions are still taxable. Using a mixer doesn’t hide gains from tax authorities; failing to report them can trigger audits or penalties. Always keep records and understand your local tax obligations.                  How to stay safe and avoid scam-linked mixers              If you decide to use a cryptocurrency mixer, your safety and security should be paramount. Here are some essential tips to avoid scams and legal troubles:Choose reputable mixers: Conduct thorough research. Look for mixers with good reviews, transparent operations and clear compliance policies.Avoid unknown or suspicious services: Steer clear of mixers linked to scams, hacks or regulatory actions.Check for licensing and compliance: Prefer mixers that comply with AML/KYC regulations, especially if you are a business or high-value user.Understand fees and timelines: Be clear on the fees involved and the expected time for your funds to be returned after mixing.Use hardware wallets and strong security practices: Always safeguard your private keys and use hardware wallets to minimize risks.Stay updated on regulations: Laws surrounding crypto mixers evolve rapidly. Staying informed will help you avoid inadvertent legal violations.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-mixer-and-how-does-it-work?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T12:00:15.000Z,"StarkWare launches mobile-friendly zero-knowledge prover","Blockchain company StarkWare has unveiled zero-knowledge (ZK) prover STARK Two (S-two), enabling enhanced privacy and verification on everyday devices like phones, laptops and browsers. The company said the new ZK prover allows users to generate complex cryptographic proofs from the client side. This means users can generate ZK-proofs directly on their devices instead of relying on a server or cloud infrastructure, opening the door for faster and more private applications across the internet. “S-two will bring STARK proving to everyday devices, and open the door for new real-world proving use cases,” said Eli Ben-Sasson, StarkWare co-founder and CEO, adding that the tool could empower the next wave of ZK applications. The company said the ZK prover is now available in public alpha and is set to roll out on Starknet, its Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, later this year.  StarkWare says new ZK prover is 39 times faster than old solutions StarkWare said that benchmark tests for the S-two ZK prover showed that it was 39 times faster than previous solutions. The performance leap enables smoother experiences in privacy-enhancing applications. The upgrade also allows use cases in private transactions, ZK-based identity and verifiable artificial intelligence. StarkWare said S-two runs on CPUs, GPUs and will soon be on browsers. “For years we’ve called the prover our magic wand, a tool that transforms complex computation into a simple proof,” Ben-Sasson said. “Now, the wand has become a lightsaber in your pocket, something anyone can wield, instantly, from your own device.”According to StarkWare, developers can build with S-two, adding that its alpha release supports hardware targets. Furthermore, the company said ZK ecosystem participants like Kakarot, Nexus, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs have already adopted the technology. Kakarot uses S-two inside ETHProofs to generate Ethereum block proofs more efficiently, while Nexus is standardizing RISC-V traces to align with S-two’s architecture. Meanwhile, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs are adding GPU acceleration to push the prover’s performance even further.Use cases for S-two zero-knowledge proverStarkWare chief operating officer Oren Katz told Cointelegraph that S-two marks a shift in how ZK-proofs are used in daily lives. Generating validity proofs directly in devices will allow privacy-preserving features in messaging, payments and digital identity. “You can prove a payment was valid without showing your balance, or verify identity without revealing personal details,” Katz added. Katz said that even salary payments could be made onchain with full transparency and no exposure of sensitive information. He dubbed the development a “big step toward bringing zero-knowledge tech into the mainstream.”Beyond privacy, Katz said, local proof generation also unlocks use cases in other industries. The executive told Cointelegraph that it can allow gamers to play offline and later generate cryptographic proof of their achievements. “An operator, instead of running all logic onchain to prove integrity, can run it on their own servers and simply generate a proof that it was executed correctly,” Katz added.Related: Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden’s cashless-society rethinkNew ZK prover follows Ethereum’s privacy pushThe launch of StarWare’s upgraded ZK prover follows Ethereum’s push for better privacy.

Subscriptions to BGUSD can be made using either USDC (USDC) or USDt (USDT), and the asset is redeemable back to USDC on demand.The company said the yield is derived from a basket of tokenized instruments, including US Treasury bills and high-grade money-market funds. “These assets are managed via partnerships with regulated institutional tokenization providers such as Superstate,” Bitget CEO Gracy Chen told Cointelegraph.The product’s structure is designed to reduce exposure to crypto volatility while delivering returns through traditional financial instruments. Bitget to roll out third-party attestationsIn response to questions about transparency, Chen said that Bitget is preparing to roll out third-party attestations to provide visibility into BGUSD’s asset backing.“Transparency and accountability are core principles of BGUSD’s framework,” she said. “While independent attestations are in the works, our institutional partners are already subject to rigorous audit requirements and regulatory oversight.”Chen clarified how Bitget maintains liquidity for users who want to redeem BGUSD. The executive said Bitget directly manages the reserve pool, which includes stable, on-hand assets like USDC. According to Chen, BGUSD does not fall under the definitions of a stablecoin or a security and is not subject to specific licensing requirements. “It’s structured as a yield-bearing stable asset certificate that’s exclusive to the Bitget platform,” Chen told Cointelegraph.Chen added that Bitget will limit access to BGUSD in jurisdictions where digital asset restrictions apply.

2025-05-27T08:45:00.000Z,"How central banks are testing blockchain-based monetary policy","Why are central banks looking at blockchains?              Central banks are tiptoeing into the world of blockchain not because it is fashionable but because every part of the money-making machine, from settlement rails to asset custody, is slowly being rewritten as code.The financial industry is already tokenizing money-market funds, Treasurys and even bank deposits. According to the Atlantic Council, 134 jurisdictions are studying or piloting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), up from just 35 in 2020. Meanwhile, commercial banks have begun to warn that if they cannot move tokenized deposits across public blockchains such as Solana or private ledgers like R3 Corda, they risk being left behind.From a central bank’s vantage point, two questions matter:First, can traditional operations, such as open-market purchases, standing facilities and reserve remuneration still work if reserves and government bonds become smart tokens? Second, can monetary transmission improve when policy logic is hard-wired into code? These questions motivate pilots such as Project Pine, Project Guardian in Singapore, the Bank of England’s wholesale CBDC sandbox and Japan’s multiyear retail CBDC pilot.                  What is “tokenized” monetary policy?              Tokenized monetary policy means that the liabilities and assets a central bank uses to steer short-term interest rates exist as programmable tokens on a distributed-ledger platform. In such a token arrangement, what the BIS describes as an ecosystem where money and securities share a common ledger, monetary functions are executed by smart contracts, replacing the traditional batch file processes used in overnight real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems.In practice, each policy tool is expressed as code:Interest on reserves becomes an automated coupon that accrues to a wallet address once a block closes.Repo and reverse-repo agreements become conditional asset swaps that self-liquidate at maturity.Collateral haircuts are numeric parameters the central bank can toggle in real time, with changes propagating instantly to all counterparties.Project Pine demonstrated all three, using ERC-20 tokens for reserves and securities on a permissioned Ethereum-compatible chain.But how is tokenized monetary policy different from traditional monetary policy?Traditional policy operations rely on central bank systems such as Fedwire or the Bank of England’s RTGS. These systems close overnight, settle in discrete batches and require multiple human sign-offs. A tokenized system settles atomically in seconds, keeps an immutable audit trail and lets policy adjustments propagate without waiting for dealers to book trades. The BIS paper on tokenisation notes that combining assets and settlement on a single ledger can shrink operational risk and latency.Did you know? A repo is a short-term secured loan in which one party sells securities and agrees to repurchase them later at a higher price. In contrast, a reverse repo is the same transaction viewed from the counterparty’s perspective (buying the securities and later reselling them).                  What is Project Pine?              Project Pine is a research initiative led by the BIS Innovation Hub and the New York Fed that explores how central banks could run monetary policy in a future where money and government securities are digital tokens managed on blockchain-like systems.Launched in late 2024 and published in May 2025, the project built a working prototype, a “starter kit” for central banks, designed to test whether tools like interest on reserves, repo operations and asset purchases can be run using smart contracts.The project ran simulated financial scenarios, mimicking both calm and crisis conditions:Normal conditions: The smart contract automatically conducted a one-day reverse-repo, draining reserves by posting bids at a pre-set interest rate.Liquidity shock: When simulated market stress pushed interest rates too high, an emergency lending facility kicked in automatically, within seconds, helping stabilize rates.Asset-purchase program: The toolkit accepted bids, calculated allocations and settled trades between digital reserves and tokenized bonds instantly.These scenarios were run in a test environment with simulated commercial banks and a programmable blockchain platform. Everything from interest payments to collateral valuation was automated, providing a glimpse into how monetary policy might function in a 24/7, tokenized financial system.This was not an isolated experiment. Other central banks are running parallel pilots that explore similar ground with their distinct approaches:Although temporarily offline as of May 24, 2025, MAS news releases show that Singapore’s Project Guardian has tested tokenized deposits and government bonds in live repo transactions, proving that interbank settlement can occur on a shared DLT without sending payments through Swift.Meanwhile, the Bank of England has taken a dual-rail approach. A July 2024 discussion paper stresses that wholesale tokenized money could sit alongside RTGS balances, letting commercial banks pick whichever rail meets their liquidity needs. Governor Andrew Bailey has warned that if tokenized deposits stall, the Bank “must continue to prepare for a wholesale CBDC.”On the retail front, Japan’s multi-year programme has entered a live “pilot” phase, constructing an end-to-end infrastructure, from smartphone wallets to a central ledger, capable of handling tens of thousands of transactions per second. The pilot also explores privacy-enhancing overlays, reflecting consumer expectations for cash-like anonymity.Taken together, these pilots confirm that key features like programmability, real-time visibility, and atomic settlement are no longer theoretical — they work. They don’t yet answer the more challenging question: How do central banks transition an entire financial system to such rails without disrupting credit creation and intermediation?Did you know? Project Pine’s digital monetary system is built like a three-layer cake: The bottom layer is a programmable blockchain (Besu), the middle is packed with tokenized money and assets (like ERC-20 reserves) and the top layer runs the smart contracts that carry out monetary policy actions.                  Why is Project Pine important?              Project Pine is the first of its kind to show that core central bank tools could be rebuilt using smart contracts. It proves that:Policy tools can be deployed faster, possibly within seconds.Facilities like repo or asset purchases can adapt automatically to changing market conditions.Tokenization could streamline operations, reduce friction and offer greater flexibility.Who was involved in Project Pine experiments?Seven major central banks, including those of Australia, Canada, England, Mexico, Switzerland, the EU and the US, collaborated on shaping the toolkit and defining test requirements. The findings don’t commit any of these banks to adopt such systems, but they provide a solid foundation for future research and policymaking.What did Project Pine test?To see how well the system works, Project Pine ran tests based on real-world situations, such as raising interest rates or a government debt crisis. They tried short and long periods, small and large financial systems, tight and loose money conditions and different ways of lending (like bank loans or corporate bonds). This helped check if the system could handle all kinds of economic ups and downs.Did you know? In Project Pine, central bank operations like paying interest on reserves or managing collateral aren’t done manually; they're handled by smart contracts coded directly into the top “protocol layer” of the blockchain stack.                  Practical design challenges in tokenized monetary policy              As central banks explore moving policy tools onto blockchains, they face several significant design hurdles. These aren’t just technical. They’re legal, operational and even philosophical. Here are the key ones:Interoperability: Can different blockchains talk to each other? Today’s financial system is like a highway with shared rules. However, blockchain ecosystems are more like separate islands, each with its own rules and roads. Public networks like Solana, private ones like Corda, or permissioned platforms like Besu don’t always “talk” to each other smoothly. This can cause issues like payment delays or funds getting stuck between platforms. Experts also warn that if too many users gather around one dominant blockchain, it could create unhealthy concentration, making the whole system more fragile.Legal finality: Does blockchain data legally count? Many countries still treat blockchain records as transaction evidence, not legally binding proof of ownership. So, even if a tokenized treasury bond moves onchain, the law might still require a separate “golden record” kept offchain by a trusted authority. Until legal systems catch up, this split could limit how far tokenized finance can go.Cyber resilience: What happens when something goes wrong? Blockchain systems run on code, and that code can have bugs. In a traditional setup, if something breaks, humans can step in. But with smart contracts, “code is law.” That’s why countries like Japan are building complete backup plans into their pilots. They’re testing how to respond to cyberattacks, technical failures or even smart contract glitches because in a digital money system, even a small error could have significant consequences.Privacy vs transparency: How much should be visible? Banks and regulators need transparency to monitor financial risks and prevent crime. But regular people want privacy, especially when using money for everyday purchases. Balancing those two needs is tricky. Policymakers are now experimenting with ideas like tiered disclosure (more visibility for big transactions), zero-knowledge proofs (which let you prove something without revealing all details), and even “anonymity vouchers” that let users make some transactions without being tracked.These challenges aren’t deal-breakers, but they do show that making money programmable isn’t as simple as flipping a switch. Central banks must work closely with lawmakers, cybersecurity experts and the financial industry to ensure tokenized monetary systems are safe, fair and reliable.                  The road ahead              The future of tokenized monetary policy will likely unfold in carefully staged phases, balancing innovation with financial stability.The BIS Innovation Hub lists more than a dozen ongoing tokenization projects from Australia’s Project Dunbar (multi-CBDC bridge) to Switzerland’s Project Helvetia (DLT-based repo). Commercial banks, meanwhile, are shifting rails: HSBC settled its first tokenized-deposit payment in April 2025, and Euroclear is piloting blockchain settlement for tokenized bonds.Central banks face a coordination game: Go slow and risk private standards hardening around them; go too fast and upend the funding model of commercial banks. The likeliest path is a phased approach:Stage 1: Limited-scope wholesale CBDC sandboxes plus tokenized collateral for central-bank counterparties.Stage 2: Dual-rail environments where RTGS balances and tokenized reserves interoperate via synchronization layers.Stage 3: Full adoption of smart-contract-based policy tools, possibly including real-time fiscal transfers.Just as earlier shifts like the rollout of RTGS systems or inflation-targeting regimes were introduced gradually to test and refine their impact, tokenized systems will be phased in through pilots, sandboxes and hybrid models before full-scale adoption.Whether it ultimately reshapes how central banks manage the economy remains to be seen.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-central-banks-are-testing-blockchain-based-monetary-policy?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Balland was subsequently rescued by the French police days later.Security measures beefed upFrance’s Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau increased security measures for crypto entrepreneurs and their family members residing in France earlier this month after the series of high-profile attacks.Related:  Another suspect to surrender in NYC crypto torture caseA GitHub page created by Jameson Lopp, a cypherpunk and co-founder of self-custodial firm Casa, indicates that six incidents of criminal activity demanding crypto ransom have taken place in France so far this year, with half of the incidents taking place in Paris.Further, industry executives are bolstering their security by hiring professional bodyguards in a bid to deter malicious actors.Magazine: Crypto scam hub expose stunt goes viral, Kakao detects 70K scam apps",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/france-arrests-suspects-linked-crypto-kidnappings-report?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

As its price broke $109,000, another $88 million in longs were wiped out in the second wave.However, as short-term traders faced margin calls and forced selling, long-term holders (LTH) responded very differently and increased their accumulation.This caused the long-term holder realized capitalization to surge past $28 billion, a level not seen since April. Realized cap is a measure of the value of each Bitcoin based on the last time it was moved, rather than the current market price.Long-term investors are using this period of forced selling to increase their exposure and accumulate more Bitcoin for the long run, Amr Taha noted. “This strategic accumulation during moments of market stress reflects the deep conviction of LTHs.”“Rather than being shaken out by short-term volatility, they [LTH] see these liquidation-driven dips as prime opportunities to strengthen their positions, reinforcing the foundation for future price appreciation.”BTC short-term holders (red) and long-term holders (green) net realized cap.

Antpool CEO Andy Chow said:\""Antpool has become the bridge operator for Bitlayer to support Bitcoin innovation and protect miners’ interests.”BitVM (Bitcoin Virtual Machine) is a framework that enables complex smart contracts to be deployed on the Bitcoin blockchain without changing the base protocol. The idea was introduced by Robin Linux in 2023, and allows for the complex computation involved in smart contract systems to be verified onchain and executed offchain in a way resembling optimistic rollups.Related: Here’s how Bitcoin is transforming into Web3’s backboneA BitVM implementationBitlayer is a BitVM implementation, aiming to allow Bitcoin to flow through decentralized finance (DeFi) systems and layer-2 networks. According to Chow, the implementation might lead to heightened activity in Bitcoin’s network and generate revenue for miners:“This expansion of Bitcoin’s use cases will drive more network activity, generating additional transaction fees and revenue opportunities for miners. As block rewards decrease over time, growing fee markets are critical for miners’ sustainable income.“Mining pools such as Chow’s Antpool play a critical role in the adoption of BitVM implementations because they directly determine the inclusion and validation of new types of transactions and scripts at the consensus layer.BitVM requires miners to include custom Taproot-based transactions that encode interactive verification logic. Mining pools must agree to include these non-standard or computationally intensive scripts in blocks, otherwise the protocol would simply not function.Related: StarkWare researchers propose smart contracts for Bitcoin with ColliderVMMining pool supportAccording to Hashrate Index data, Antpool controls 17.2% of Bitcoin’s hashrate as of May 26, while F2Pool controls 8.2% and Spiderpool 6.1%. This results in a total supporting hashrate of  31.5%.Bitcoin hashrate distribution between mining pools. Source: Hash Rate IndexThis is enough to secure transaction inclusion in under one in every three blocks. This is presumably enough for testing, prototyping and early-stage applications.With this percentage of supporting hashrate, developers can build functional systems with the assumption that, despite some latency, BitVM transactions will be processed. So while it is hard to view this hashrate as allowing a fully functional deployment, it is likely enough for the early phases of BitVM development.A Bitlayer representative told Cointelegraph that “should collective hashrate support weaken or policy shifts occur within Bitcoin Core, we have a multi-layered contingency plan.” This plan includes the “expanded mining pool partnerships,” referring to the company’s intention to keep onboarding more mining pools.Magazine: ZK-proofs are bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin — BitcoinOS and Starknet",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitlayer-secures-40-of-bitcoin-s-hashrate-to-bring-smart-contracts-to-btc?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
