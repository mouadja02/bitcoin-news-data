Norwegian digital asset company K33 became the latest firm to join the Bitcoin (BTC) train. On Wednesday, May 28, the company announced it secured 60 million Swedish krona, worth about $5.6 million, for its Bitcoin treasury. To fund the acquisition, the Oslo-headquartered company, which is listed on Nasdaq First North in Stockholm, issued 150.56 million new shares worth 15 million SEK. K33 also issued 301.12 million free warrants valued at 45 million SEK. According to the company, the capital comes from insiders and aligned investors, including Klein Group and Modiola AS. Free warrants are zero-interest instruments that investors can later convert into equity at the same price. If converted before March 2026, investors are entitled to additional free warrants at the same conversion rate. If fully exercised, the warrants would allow K33 to raise an additional 75 million SEK, approximately $7.1 million.

2025-05-28T15:42:20.000Z,"Users question XRP's decentralized nature","Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse has asked Bitcoin and other blockchain technologies to set their differences aside and work together to move the industry forward as they grow more popular. This statement follows Ripple’s gift of the skull of Satoshi to the Bitcoin community. Garlinghouse said , “ I hope this gesture continues to remind folks that we (BTC, XRP, and other crypto communities) have more in common than we think.” Special guest at Bitcoin 2025 – the Skull of Satoshi, donated by @Ripple to the Bitcoin community. The Skull will now have a permanent home at the Bitcoin Museum in Nashville. pic.twitter.com/Eo3kNqRvGp — The Bitcoin Conference (@TheBitcoinConf) May 28, 2025 For a long time, Garlinghouse has viewed XRP as a competitor of Bitcoin. His excuse for not overtaking BTC was the SEC case, especially under Biden’s administration. Early this year, he was against the SBR, citing that other crypto coins should also be considered. He said, “Maximalism remains the enemy of crypto progress, and I’m very glad to see fewer and fewer folks ascribe to this outdated and misinformed thinking.” Luckily for him, Trump has considered XRP a digital stockpile. However, BTC is at the very front with a market cap of over $2 trillion, while XRP is at the fourth position with a market cap of over $130 billion. Garlinghous asserts he owns the three big crypto assets, including Bitcoin. Meanwhile, the BTC conference has quickly become one of the year’s defining events for the crypto industry. It hosted over 30,000 attendees, 300 exhibitors, and a packed lineup of speakers. Garlinghouse calls for attention to blockchain energy usage Garlinghouse said, “ The Skull of Satoshi was originally built to call attention to blockchain energy usage, and today it’s a symbol and reminder of Bitcoin’s incredible staying power to many around the world (including me!).” The statement sounds sarcastic because, in recent years, Bitcoin has used around 57.09 billion kWh per year. This is comparable to electricity usage in countries like Argentina or the Netherlands. On the other hand, XRP uses 474,000 kWh, a fraction of the energy used by Bitcoin. Compared to Bitcoin, XRP’s energy consumption is 100,000 times smaller than Bitcoin’s per transaction. Meanwhile, BTQ and Quandela have agreed to look into how photonic quantum computing can be used for BTQ’s Quantum Sampling Proof-of-Work (QSPoW). It is an alternative to Bitcoin’s standard safe mining model that uses less energy. Users question XRP’s decentralized nature The public nature of the payments firm has raised an interlinked question of Ripple’s centralized leadership and XRP’s supposed decentralized model. A user asked on X why Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is the face of XRP, given XRP’s claim to being a decentralized crypto asset. “I don’t see the same arrangement with BTC,” they said. Chief Technology Officer of Ripple, David Schwartz, jumped in right away to calm people down and give a full explanation. Schwartz brought up the fact that Garlinghouse is the CEO of the company Ripple. But “XRP has no issuer,” adding that all XRP tokens were made when the XRP Ledger first came out. The CTO of the payments company also talked about decentralization, which is one of the most important ideas in the crypto world. Schwartz also said that people worried about XRP Ledger’s decentralized model should focus less on meanings and more on what they want from decentralization.

Berachain ( BERA ) price dropped to $2.689, down 70% from its highest level this year. This steep decline has reduced its market cap from over $920 million in March to $339 million. Activity on Berachain’s network continues to decline. According to Nansen data, it had only 104,000 active addresses over the past seven days, trailing behind other top chains like Sui ( SUI ) and Base. Berachain’s transactions fell more than 40% in the last seven days to 4.245 million, making it the worst-performing chain tracked by Nansen. Fees on the network also dropped 37% to $5,200 over the same period.

PayPal USD supply on Berachain has dropped 42% in the last 30 days to $105 million, while Honey has fallen 68% to $87 million. Berachain stablecoin supply has dropped | Source: DeFi Llama Worse, Berachain has had outflows of US dollars into its ecosystem for all days since March 27. The total value locked in its platform has dropped by 50% in the last 30 days to $2.92 billion. These figures indicate that Berachain is rapidly losing traction, marking one of the steepest downfalls in the crypto industry this year. BERA price technical analysis Berachain price chart | Source: crypto.news Berachain has been in a strong downtrend since hitting its post-airdrop high of $9.1823 on March 2. The eight-hour chart shows that BERA price is hovering near its all-time low of $2.70, forming a double-bottom pattern. A double bottom is one of the most bullish reversal signs in technical analysis. However, BERA remains below its 50-period and 100-period moving averages. While the double-bottom pattern may suggest a potential relief rally, a drop below $2.7021 would invalidate the bullish case and could open the door to further downside, potentially targeting the psychological level of $2.50.

2025-05-28T15:35:19.000Z,"Crypto Whale James Wynn’s $87M Portfolio Wiped Out in 5 Days: A Detailed Recap","TL;DR James Wynn – an industry participant known across the digital asset space for his high-risk leverage trades – became the latest rock star of crypto by making some jaw-dropping trades before the latest Lookonchain update revealed a total wipe-out. In a twist, an anonymous trader profited $5.6M in three days by consistently taking the opposite side of his trades. The Adventures of Wynn Earlier this month, he entered a long BTC position with roughly $390 million. The bet initially had a liquidation price of $96,600 and a margin of just south of $10 million. In the following days, Wynn increased the position to a whopping $1.25 billion with 40x leverage. At one point, the trader was at the crest of the wave, standing at the staggering $87 million in unrealized profit due to BTC’s price rally above $110,000. However, towards the end of last week, the asset’s valuation (and the entire cryptocurrency market) retraced following Donald Trump’s threat to impose tariffs of 50% on the European Union, effective from June 1. Logically, the downtrend wiped out a significant chunk of Wynn’s gains. He then flipped bearish on the asset, opening a short position of 1,038 BTC at $107,711 with a liquidation price of $149,100. Eventually, the trader called it quits , closing all contracts with a profit of $25 million. The whale’s actions were praised by many X users, with some calling him a “legend.” Others, though, have not been so kind, wishing to see him in the red. Wynn prepared a special post for those stating: For all my haters out there who so very much loved to see my portfolio swing down by $60,000,000. Just know, now you get to see it swing BACK UP INTO THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS. I repeat HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS. Money that haters like you can’t even dream of having because… pic.twitter.com/VnFo6i5bhT — James Wynn (@JamesWynnReal) May 27, 2025 The blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain revealed that just a few hours after announcing the profit, the trader “was back in the casino” and continued to long BTC with 40x leverage. “The portion size reaches 684 BTC ($75.34M), and the liquidation price is $103,120,” the entity stated on May 26. Subsequently, Wynn increased his long position to 5,676 BTC, with a liquidation price of $108,010. Besides interacting with BTC, Wynn is known as a proponent of PEPE and opened several positions involving the asset. Back in the day, he spent $182,000 to purchase 7.2 trillion tokens. He sold 6.76 trillion PEPE for almost $34 million and left 443.7 billion PEPE (worth over $6 million at current rates). Lookonchain revealed that Wynn had been actively trading the meme coin on Hyperquid lately, making four profitable trades that netted $25.4 million. The platform later estimated that the whale deposited 240 billion PEPE into Binance, raising the question of whether he was preparing to cash out. Shortly after, the entity disclosed that it seemed like Wynn had sold the stash to fund his long BTC position and informed that he deposited the remainder of his PEPE holdings into the exchange. Betting Against Wynn and Big Loss The whale executed his whopping long and short positions on the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid, and these trades were visible to other market participants. Lookonchain revealed the case of one savvy trader who bet against Wynn’s actions and, in just three days, made $5.6 million. Specifically, they shorted BTC every time Wynn went long and vice versa. On May 24, trader 0x2258 opened a short position in BTC and ETH and closed it the following day, realizing a profit of $1.36 million. Then, Wynn opened a BTC short position, while the other trader went long on BTC and ETH, only to make a profit of $2.54 million on May 26. Finally, the unknown industry participant opened short positions on the two cryptocurrencies, generating a profit of $1.7 million ( at least on paper). Some speculated that the mysterious trader might be Wynn operating from another account to hedge his bets. However, the whale rejected the rumors, saying : “Not happy with this post at all. Whoever trader 0x2258 is, it is not me and have no clue who it is . I only trade on one HL account and that’s public. Don’t start spreading fake news with zero proof.” The most recent Lookonchain update, though, paints a painful picture for the whale. It reads that it took him 70 days to build the aforementioned $87 million portfolio (at its peak) but only five days to lose almost all of it. James Wynn( @JamesWynnReal ) has wiped out almost all his profits on #Hyperliquid . It took him 70 days to go from 0 to $87M+ in profit, and only 5 days to lose almost all the $87M+ in profit. https://t.co/IUTpCuzoSB pic.twitter.com/n2p3nftZ3G — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) May 28, 2025 The post Crypto Whale James Wynn’s $87M Portfolio Wiped Out in 5 Days: A Detailed Recap appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-whale-james-wynns-87m-portfolio-wiped-out-in-5-days-a-detailed-recap/,"BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|ZRX|PEPE","BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|PEPE",cryptocompare

2025-05-28T15:23:14.000Z,"Expert Sets Bullish Price Target, Says XRP Will Pump Without Warning","The XRP community is once again charged with excitement following a bold price prediction from prominent crypto analyst JackTheRippler. In a recent post on X, JackTheRippler shared a chart forecasting that XRP could surge dramatically, reaching between $28 and $30 by October 2025. His message was clear and emphatic: XRP is going to pump without any warning. This assertion has captured the attention of both seasoned investors and new entrants in the crypto space, reigniting debates about XRP’s long-term potential and its readiness to break free from years of regulatory headwinds and price stagnation. But what’s fueling this sudden wave of optimism, and how realistic is this bullish projection? #XRP IS GOING TO PUMP WITHOUT ANY WARNING! pic.twitter.com/Nd6UVBqYv9 — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) May 28, 2025 Decoding the Bullish Sentiment Around XRP JackTheRippler’s forecast isn’t appearing in a vacuum. The bullish sentiment surrounding XRP has been gradually building, especially with recent developments around the Ripple-SEC lawsuit. The legal clarity has enabled Ripple to ramp up its operations, focusing on regions with crypto-friendly regulatory frameworks. At the same time, institutional interest in Ripple’s payment solutions — particularly its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service — has been expanding across global corridors, including Latin America, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. These developments position XRP not just as a speculative asset but as a key player in the evolving global payments infrastructure. The Road to $28–$30: Can XRP Realistically Hit These Targets? JackTheRippler’s price target of $28–$30 is undeniably ambitious. At current valuations, such a surge would represent an astronomical increase, placing XRP’s market cap into territory usually reserved for the very top echelon of global assets. For context, XRP has historically hovered in the $0.50 to $1.50 range over the past few years, even during periods of heightened market activity. However, the crypto markets are no strangers to explosive, seemingly unpredictable rallies. Assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum have repeatedly defied expectations, posting massive gains during bullish cycles that were once thought impossible. For XRP, several catalysts could propel it toward JackTheRippler’s bold target: the mass adoption of Ripple’s payment solutions, deeper institutional integration, increased regulatory clarity, and the possibility of major partnerships or even central bank digital currency (CBDC) collaborations built on the XRP Ledger. Importantly, the phrase “without warning” underscores the often volatile and sudden nature of crypto market movements. Although fundamentals are important, the crypto market has repeatedly demonstrated that sentiment, hype, and speculation can propel prices to astonishing heights, particularly when limited supply meets rapid demand growth. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Reaction and Market Dynamics Within the XRP community, JackTheRippler’s prediction has sparked both excitement and caution. His supporters highlight his proven track record of accurate analysis, citing his technical charts that frequently identify crucial resistance and breakout points. Skeptics, however, caution that such dramatic targets should be taken with a grain of salt, emphasizing the importance of measured, long-term investment strategies over hype-fueled chasing. Regardless of where one stands, it’s clear that XRP is entering a phase of renewed attention. Investors are closely monitoring macroeconomic trends, regulatory developments, and Ripple’s business moves, as these factors could impact XRP’s future performance. With Bitcoin’s next halving cycle already setting the stage for a broader crypto bull run, XRP could well be poised to ride the wave, potentially validating JackTheRippler’s bold claim that the pump will come swiftly and without warning. JackTheRippler’s latest bullish call on XRP has injected fresh energy into the market, with his prediction of a $28–$30 price target by October 2025 igniting both enthusiasm and debate. While such projections are certainly ambitious, they reflect the persistent belief among XRP advocates that the asset’s true potential has yet to be unlocked. As Ripple continues to expand its global reach and XRP gains further utility in cross-border payments, a sudden and dramatic price surge remains a possibility. Whether or not XRP hits JackTheRippler’s lofty target, one thing is certain: in the fast-moving world of crypto, transformative moments often arrive when least expected — and XRP investors are watching closely.

Analyst Evaluates!","Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new ATH after its rally last week, but then entered a consolidation period. While analysts generally expect the uptrend to continue, one analyst noted that Bitcoin could retest the $94,000 support amid market consolidation. Keith Alan, co-founder of trading resource Material Indicators, said in his latest analysis that Bitcoin has correction potential and could test $94,000. Keith Alan said that whales continue to accumulate and Bitcoin consolidates above $100,000. Stating that this situation supports the bullish outlook in BTC, Alan said that there is also a possibility of correction. If sellers temporarily regain control, the downside target could be around the 21-week moving average of $94,000, the analyst said. “We are in a bull market and the trend is upward, but in trading it is not always bullish. Only going up is a myth. Consecutive green candles of 7 and above are rare. If this occurs, this green period is usually followed by periods of consolidation or correction. Currently, BTC is consolidating above $100,000 and whales are accumulating. While the outlook is bullish, there is a possibility that Bitcoin could face a correction. If a correction does occur, Bitcoin would face support at $94,000, which currently coincides with the 21-Week Moving Average. So, in case of a BTC correction, I expect a test of $94,000.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Is Bitcoin Next for a New Record or a Correction?

Daily Crypto News Digest","In crypto news today: Crypto market is red today RedStone and Securitize Bring BlackRock-Linked RWAs to Solana GSR and Polygon-Incubated Katana Blockchain Goes Live Veterans-Backed Fintech Velocity Launches with $10M Pre-Seed for Stablecoin Infra __________ Crypto market is red today Over the past 24 hours, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization has decreased by 2.6% to $3.55 trillion. At the time of writing, the daily crypto trading volume is $109 billion. Of the top 10 coins per market capitalization, only Ethereum (ETH) saw its price rise today. It appreciated just 0.4%, meaning it’s mostly unchanged over the past day. It’s now changing hands at $2,671. At the same time, Bitcoin (BTC) decreased by 1.4%, now trading at $108,551. The highest drop is Dogecoin (DOGE)’s 3.1% to $0.2231. Of the top 100 coins, 20 recorded price increases today. Toncoin (TON) and Tokenize Xchange (TKX) saw double-digit increases of 14.1% and 10.3% to $3.45 and $38.9, respectively. Monero (XMR) fell the most in this category. It’s down 9.2% to the price of $353. RedStone and Securitize Bring BlackRock-Linked RWAs to Solana RedStone , a blockchain oracle provider, has said in an announcement that real-world assets (RWAs) like tokenized credit and US Treasuries are coming to Solana . With that, the company announced the launch on the Solana network, in partnership with Securitize . Per the press release shared with Cryptonews , this will unlock institutional-grade RWAs such as Apollo’s ACRED and BlackRock’s BUIDL for decentralized finance applications. Also, it will give Solana developers direct access to price feeds for both traditional and crypto assets. This is “a significant step toward making RWA-powered DeFi a reality across high-performance chains,” the teams said. 1/ This integration connects Solana developers with secure, composable price feeds for traditional and crypto assets, making RWA-powered DeFi possible on Solana for the very first time.

2025-05-28T15:00:38.000Z,"Sen. Lummis Gears Up To Present 1 Million Bitcoin Acquisition Bill To The Senate Next Week","At the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas on Tuesday, Senator Cynthia Lummis, a staunch advocate for BTC and cryptocurrencies, announced that President Donald Trump supports the upcoming Bitcoin Act, which aims to facilitate the purchase of 1 million BTC and is expected to be introduced to Congress next week. Long-Term Bitcoin Investment Strategy Originally proposed by Lummis on July 31, 2024, the legislation seeks to establish a strategic BTC reserve for the US government, serving as an additional store of value to strengthen the nation’s balance sheet. The bill outlines a BTC Purchase Program designed to acquire approximately 5% of the total Bitcoin supply over a five-year period, mirroring the scale of US gold reserves. The BTC acquired would be held for a minimum of 20 years, ensuring a long-term investment strategy. Following challenges faced by the previous administration under President Joe Biden, Lummis reintroduced the bill in March of this year, emphasizing the importance of institutional support for Bitcoin. A number of crypto industry leaders have also suggested innovative ways to implement this executive order, including proposals to use BTC for refinancing national debt. US Government May Hold 200,000 BTC One notable suggestion comes from the Bitcoin Policy Institute, which proposed the introduction of “ BitBonds .” These would be structured US Treasury bonds that allocate 90% of the proceeds to traditional funding operations, while 10% would go toward BTC acquisition. The Institute estimates that, assuming a scale of $2 trillion in BitBonds, this initiative could generate annual interest savings of approximately $700 billion over a decade. Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, echoed this proposal during the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Summit on April 15. VanEck’s plan also includes a similar 90%-10% bond structure, offering investors potential BTC gains with a cap of 4.5% annual yield. Any gains exceeding this threshold would be split equally between the government and bondholders . While Lummis is enthusiastic about advancing the Bitcoin Act, the path to full Congressional approval remains uncertain. The success of the bill will depend on garnering support from her Senate colleagues, critical for increasing the nation’s Bitcoin holdings. Fox journalist Eleanor Terret reported on X (formerly Twitter) that Lummis indicated the US government currently holds around 200,000 BTC. However, she noted that the information is not fully transparent due to classification following a mandated audit from the White House. When writing, the market’s leading cryptocurrency trades at $108,975, recording a slight retrace of 0.5% in the 24-hour time frame and 2.5% when compared to its record high of $111,800 reached last week.

2025-05-28T15:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the industry’s most overlooked asset","Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin Depot A new proposal to install Bitcoin ATMs in federal buildings highlights an important question: Can crypto truly go mainstream without a stronger physical presence? For years, the industry has focused on software and decentralization, but its reluctance to invest in real-world infrastructure is starting to show. Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be. Everyone loves to talk about decentralization. There’s a good reason behind this. It defines the movement, shapes the technology, and supports the vision of a better financial system . While the industry focuses on code and algorithms, it lacks something basic. A decentralized system that exists only online is not genuinely decentralized. Physical infrastructure is the missing link Bitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the missing link. Without tools like ATMs, kiosks and access points at traditional retail locations, crypto remains out of reach for millions. Decentralization is not just about removing intermediaries. True decentralization requires expanding access. Without real-world touchpoints, even the most advanced network becomes limited to a closed circle of insiders. Recent: Arizona governor kills two crypto bills, cracks down on Bitcoin ATMs For crypto to become mainstream, it must be easy to reach digitally and physically. That means showing up in places people already go and seamlessly integrating into people’s lives. Many groups in the American population still rely on cash or don’t have access to traditional banks. According to the latest Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation report , around 5.6 million American households don’t have a bank or savings account. Bitcoin ATMs give these users access without needing an app, a bank account or a crash course in blockchain. Most crypto tools today assume a level of financial fluency and infrastructure that millions simply do not have. The result is a digital-only ecosystem that locks out newcomers and widens the divide between early adopters and everyone else. User-friendly screen in the right place Physical infrastructure helps address this issue. A Bitcoin ATM in a grocery store or gas station is not just a convenience but a bridge to financial inclusion. It is an invitation to someone who has never bought crypto, telling them they can participate. No bank, no broker, just a user-friendly screen in a familiar place. These machines also generate new economic activity. Local businesses benefit from increased foot traffic as the kiosks create passive revenue. For many communities, they provide access to a parallel financial system that was previously out of reach. This is a tangible example of crypto’s real-world utility. It is already happening, and it is measurable. The crypto industry’s blind spot The industry often treats physical infrastructure like an afterthought. The obsession with building new digital solutions has created a blind spot. Innovation without usability builds systems that serve the few but exclude the many. If someone can buy Bitcoin ( BTC ) at the same place they buy their morning coffee, that is when crypto stops feeling like an obscure digital asset and starts becoming part of everyday life. As governments increase regulation, trusted and transparent interfaces will become more important. When operated within regulatory frameworks, Bitcoin ATMs offer a way to provide access between traditional finance and digital assets. They are familiar, easy to monitor and offer a more approachable entry point for the general public. Like any financial tool, Bitcoin ATMs have drawn scrutiny, particularly in cases where bad actors use them. Rather than dismissing the machines themselves, we should focus on investing in better oversight, stronger consumer education and smarter regulation. The overwhelming majority of people who use Bitcoin ATMs do so for legitimate reasons: to send remittances, to move money securely or to access digital assets without traditional banking barriers. Building trust does not mean avoiding or dismantling physical access, but improving it. The first time someone uses Bitcoin should not involve reading a white paper or navigating a tutorial. It should be as familiar as using an ATM or tapping a payment terminal. This is not an argument against innovation. Software and protocols will continue to evolve and play an important role. Physical infrastructure provides something those tools cannot: trust through presence. When people can see and use crypto in their neighborhood, at a store they already visit or in a format they already understand, it changes how they think about crypto and who it is for. According to Coin ATM Radar , there are over 30,000 Bitcoin ATMs in the US. It’s a meaningful start, but still only a small step toward widespread access. Crypto’s long-term success will depend not just on innovation but also on inclusion. That means building more than networks; it means building presence. When people can interact with crypto in the physical world, it stops being abstract and becomes usable. That is how digital finance becomes everyday finance.

2025-05-28T14:45:54.000Z,"ZachXBT knocks back James Wynn’s denial of coordinated token launches in his name","Blockchain detective ZachXBT refuted James Wynn’s claim that a conspiracy group is launching tokens in his name and scamming users at price peaks. He argued that Wynn has run the same type of memecoin scams on his followers over the past few years. James Wynn is known in crypto for his high-leverage contract trading and meme coin investments. He has also faced criticism over his promotion of low-cap tokens. Star Platinum showed that the crypto trader promoted tokens like WLON and WYNN, which were supposedly tied to him. Wynn denies pumping and dumping meme coins 🚨 WARNING 🚨 SCAM ALERT 🚨 you literally pumped and dumped the same kind of meme coin scams on your followers over the past few years. https://t.co/aqxuMW3WJY — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) May 28, 2025 In July 2024, Dylan accused Wynn of receiving 2% of the Babypepe supply and gradually dumping it after inflating the price. He faced backlash for not only dumping the tokens that the CTO team worked hard to acquire, but he also sold them to his followers, profiting $68,000. James Wynn was also linked to the recent controversy around the Solana meme coin MOONPIG. The trader allegedly purchased about 3% of the digital asset’s total supply, helped pump its price to a peak, and then sold off his holdings, which some in the community argued caused the sharp price drop. Wynn denied the accusations and any wrongdoing, arguing that he was only an investor and not involved in developing or manipulating the coin. He claimed that the top wallet was never his, and he doesn’t usually entertain such FUD. Alongside his high-profile rise, there are controversies and doubts around his type of digital asset investments, marked with significant losses and allegations of questionable practices. Wynn’s trading activity can be tracked from as early as December 2020. Pseudonymous user Star Platinum revealed that the trader reportedly received $6,000 in Ethereum from the now-defunct firm linked to Sam Bankman-Fried, Alameda Research. He started to attract more attention to his trades a few years later. Wynn notes in his X bio that he was one of the early investors of PEPE, a token inspired by the globally recognized ‘Pepe the Frog’ meme. The crypto trader bet on the digital asset when its total market value was $600,000. Wynn later predicted in April 2023 that PEPE would reach a $4.2 billion market cap, an unorthodox call made when the coin was just at a $4.2 million market cap. The trader’s bet turned lucrative, following PEPE’s success, which made his early investments into millions. After success with meme coins, Wynn shifted focus to leveraged trading and joined Hyperliquid. Lookonchain noted that he has been actively trading on the platform since March 13, racking up $46.5 million in profit in under 2 months. James Wynn records losses and gains on his crypto trades On-chain data from Hyperdash revealed that the trader has executed a total of 39 trades, with 17 of them resulting in profits. The firm also showed he has reduced his BTC long position, now valued at $200M, with a floating loss of ~$800K. The analytics firm also noted that Wynn’s PNL rose from $5.7M to $87M from May 5 to May 23 but currently stands at $1.91M. The crypto trader has lost around $55.3M in less than a week. On-chain data showed that Wynn’s most profitable trades include a long position in PEPE, which garnered $25.19 million in profit, followed by a long position in Bitcoin, with $6.83 million generated. Lookonchain data also highlighted that Wynn has benefited from Hyperliquid, paying the platform approximately $2.31 million in trading fees. James Wynn suffered his largest loss on May 25, around $15.86 million on a short Bitcoin position. He has also previously lost other trades, including around $3.69 million on a long Ethereum trade, approximately $1.59 million on a long Sui position, and $976,635 lost on a long BTC trade.

2025-05-28T14:44:41.000Z,"ChatGPT picks two cryptos to turn $100 into $1,000 by 2026","With the second half of 2025 fast approaching, Finbold probed OpenAI’s ChatGPT to uncover which cryptocurrencies it believes could deliver outsized returns in the year ahead. The brief was ambitious but clear: identify assets that could realistically turn a $100 investment into $1,000 by 2026. While a 900% return in 8 months is a high bar, and naturally involves considerable risk, ChatGPT narrowed its picks to two altcoins it believes offer the strongest blend of narrative, adoption potential, and real-world catalysts. The AI’s reasoning leaned on macro trends, upcoming regulatory shifts, and ongoing institutional interest, especially in areas with growing infrastructure and enterprise-grade use cases. XRP is pick number 1 The first pick is XRP , currently trading at $2.31. ChatGPT pointed to XRP’s continued traction with international financial institutions and the potential for a U.S.-based spot ETF approval as major upside drivers. A $50 investment today buys approximately 21.6 XRP tokens, and the model suggests a plausible target of around $11.50 by 2026, a fivefold increase. This would value that initial $50 stake at $250. The bullish case rests on a scenario where regulatory clarity boosts institutional inflows, particularly in payments infrastructure. The AI emphasized that XRP has already been integrated into cross-border transactions and settlement pipelines globally, positioning it as a “realistic, strong catalyst” pick. Avalanche is pick number 2 The second pick is Avalanche ( AVAX ) , a smart contract platform and Ethereum competitor known for its high transaction throughput and modular subnetwork architecture. At a current price of $23.59, a $50 allocation nets about 2.12 AVAX. If the token reaches $118, that investment could grow to $250. ChatGPT highlighted Avalanche’s rapidly expanding DeFi ecosystem and corporate partnerships as reasons why the coin has “moderate risk but high-growth potential.” With a much lower market cap relative to competitors like Solana, ChatGPT sees AVAX as well-positioned for strong upside if momentum turns bullish through 2025. ChatGPT picks to cryptocurrencies. Source: ChatGPT The model was also asked why it excluded more obvious candidates like Bitcoin, Solana, or meme coins like Pepe. It noted that while Bitcoin remains a foundational asset ($109,000 at press time), expecting a 5x move in under a year, to over half a million dollars, would require a major global shock, not just bullish momentum. Solana, trading around $174, would need to climb to approximately $870 for the same return, which, while not impossible, is a much steeper hill compared to AVAX’s lower base. Pepe, on the other hand, was dismissed as being more driven by hype cycles than by fundamentals, making it an unreliable 5x target.

2025-05-28T14:41:15.000Z,"Coinbase: The Winner Of Bitcoin's Institutional Adoption (Initiate With Buy)","Summary Coinbase became the first crypto-native company in the S&P 500, signaling broader institutional acceptance of digital assets. COIN dominates crypto custody, holding keys for 90% of Bitcoin ETF assets as well as keys for the US Marshals Service. The investment case hinges on retail trading growth and institutional Bitcoin adoption. Subscription & services revenue is the signal in its Q1 results, and transaction revenues are noise. As crypto adoption spreads, Coinbase is positioned as the trusted infrastructure provider for sovereigns and corporations. In a landmark decision, Coinbase Global ( COIN ) became the first crypto-native company to be added to the S&P 500. Millions of 401k's across the United States now have exposure to a company with Bitcoin (BTC-USD) in its corporate treasury. Many average Americans now have exposure to Bitcoin by proxy. Beyond the headline, though, Coinbase has quietly positioned itself to be a dominant player in cryptocurrency for years to come. As this nascent industry continues to take shape, there is a very high likelihood that Coinbase will continue to grow alongside it. Coinbase is uniquely positioned to benefit from two bullish tailwinds currently: speculative retail trading and institutional Bitcoin adoption. These are two meaningful growth levers in a volatile industry. As a trusted custodian and dominant exchange, it stands to benefit regardless of who enters the market; be they retail traders, corporations, or sovereigns. I rate the stock a Buy. Company Overview Coinbase facilitates the trading and custody of cryptocurrency. The company offers exchange services; allowing users to buy crypto with USD, swap cryptocurrencies with each other, stake crypto, and earn interest on cash with stablecoins. The Custodian of Choice Coinbase is by far the largest Bitcoin custodian for Bitcoin ETFs, holding the keys for 8 of the 11 major Bitcoin ETFs. It custodies 90% of the Bitcoin held in ETFs. On top of that, Coinbase is deeply embedded within the US government, as it custodies the crypto assets that are seized by the U.S. Marshals Service . The company earns a small fee on assets under custody (\""AUC\""), which varies by entity. Enterprise and sovereign interest in holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset is still a relatively niche concept, but Coinbase has put the infrastructure in place to facilitate the mass adoption of such. Investment Case The investment case in Coinbase is quite simple. It hinges on two key factors: 1) an increase in retail speculation and 2) an increase in institutional adoption. Retail trading volume is directly linked to market volatility. During the crypto winter of 2022, brought on by the collapse of FTX (a key Coinbase competitor), Coinbase trading volumes plummeted, and the stock value fell in concert. We are a long way from that crypto winter. Bitcoin recently eclipsed the $100k threshold again for the first time since February. The regulatory environment has become much warmer. The crypto market is rampaging forward. Retail speculation typically spikes in periods like this. Further, the trend toward institutional and governmental adoption is clear. Three states have started strategic Bitcoin reserves, and the New York City mayor hosted the first-ever Crypto Summit this month. There are more institutions now than ever before accumulating Bitcoin. This trend seems certain to continue. As more companies begin accumulating Bitcoin, Coinbase stands to benefit disproportionately compared to the companies that currently hold Bitcoin. The initial institutions that adopted Bitcoin are tech fanatics like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) ( MSTR ) or crypto-native companies like MARA Holdings ( MARA ) or Block ( XYZ ), so they don't rely on custodian partners like Coinbase. They self-custody their keys. As more non-crypto native companies seek to simply participate in the upside of Bitcoin without worrying about key maintenance, Coinbase's custody services are the best choice. The company is the largest and most well-regarded, as illustrated by its partnership with ETFs and the US government. This holds true for sovereigns as well, who need not bother with key maintenance. They simply desire a reserve asset, and Bitcoin is increasingly being considered as such. Many governments will likely opt for a custodian partner. Coinbase already has a vote of confidence from the most influential government in the world. It's a very privileged position to be in. In short, the two core underlying factors that will drive positive stock returns for Coinbase are looking extremely bullish. As these trends continue throughout 2025, I expect the stock to significantly outperform the major indices. Q1 Earnings Coinbase generated $2b in total revenue, split between $1.3b in transaction revenues and $698m in subscription and services growth. The 10% sequential decline in revenues was driven by a sharp 19% decline in transaction revenue in the quarter. The subscription and services segment, which includes custodian fees, stablecoin revenue (Coinbase shares USDC interest revenues with Circle), and Coinbase One subscriptions, grew 9% QoQ. The company suffered from the relative weakness of the crypto market in Q1. The crypto market is horribly volatile, as any crypto trader or onlooker is well aware, and this volatility hits Coinbase quite hard. This underpins the importance of the durable subscription & services line items. The company expects this to drop marginally next quarter to $600m-$680m, but management is focused on growing this line item over time. Coinbase's long-term value creation hinges far more on subscription & services growth rather than retail trading volume. The crypto market is basically the stock market on steroids. The fickle nature of retail equity traders is amplified in crypto trading because a much larger share of the overall crypto trading volume is comprised of retail funds. As bear markets take hold, volumes plummet. And vice versa. This makes Coinbase's trading revenue a very volatile metric and not one that should be relied upon for long-term investment returns. The subscription & services segment is the signal in Coin's Q1 report, transactions revenue bumpiness is noise. The company is set to compound subscription & services revenues quite well. The growth in sovereign and enterprise adoption will lead to durable growth in the company's custodial business, while the returns from a bull market should lead to increasing USDC balances. I believe the market broadly has bottomed for 2025 and considering crypto as an asset class is very high beta, I see a lot of upside. This will mostly be powered by Bitcoin, which is the leading indicator for all crypto returns. I've written on Bitcoin several times, most recently explaining why the seminal cryptocurrency benefits from President Trump's tariff gambit . Bitcoin has several other bullish tailwinds, namely the increasingly fervent pace of institutional adoption, the financialization of Bitcoin, and more regulatory clarity. With rising government and enterprise adoption of Bitcoin, Coinbase will enjoy a twofold benefit. First, I expect the ensuing supply shock in Bitcoin to send the price much higher in the coming months. This will pull the overall crypto market up along with it and increase transaction revenues for Coinbase. Second, Coinbase is likely to be the custodian of choice for many of these large entities, providing durable growth for subscription and services. The stock has a lot of upside potential in the coming months. This upside potential is why I believe that, despite the premium valuation , Coinbase presents quite a compelling opportunity right now. The company trades at a hefty 43x forward non-GAAP earnings, 9x forward sales, and 27x forward EV/EBIT. These are high for a company with bumpy growth, but we're at a favorable point in the cycle. The volatility of crypto deserves a premium. Bitcoin is wavering around all-time highs, and more institutions than ever are piling in. The regulatory environment is clearing up. It's highly likely the flagship cryptocurrency will go much higher before it goes lower, so I find it very likely that Coinbase will exceed expectations in trading revenues 2025. An upside surprise in transaction revenues justifies a premium multiple for now, but as previously stated, this cannot be relied on for long-term returns. What will drive long-term returns is the company's institutional business, which benefits enormously from the recent spate of companies (like GameStop and DJT media) buying Bitcoin. This trend allows Coinbase to diversify its revenue base and shield it from the worst of crypto's downside volatility. The company's position as the leading institutional partner absolutely justifies a premium valuation, and at the moment, I see further upside due to my expectation of a surprise beat in transaction revenues this year. Risks Of course, half of my investment thesis here hinges on the crypto bull market continuing on through the remainder of 2025. This is anything but certain. Sentiment in crypto turns to despair just as quickly as euphoria takes hold. A lot of Bitcoin's current bullish price action hinges on institutional adoption driving a strong supply shortage. Should there be hiccups in this road; major institutions selling their Bitcoin, ETFs shuttering, or Bitcoin whales taking profits en masse, the crypto market could quickly tumble into a bear market. To me, this seems unlikely. But it is far from impossible. Further, much of the recent euphoria in crypto markets stems from an increasingly favorable regulatory environment. US President Donald Trump has cozied up to cryptocurrency, New York City is taking steps to become the 'crypto capital of the world', and several states are considering strategic Bitcoin reserves. Bitcoin price action front-ran many of these announcements, and should the regulatory environment take longer to adjust favorably for crypto, we could see material downside in Coinbase's trading revenues. Investor Takeaway Coinbase is a rare source of transparency in a trustless environment. The company recently encountered a data breach , and CEO Brian Armstrong took to X (formerly Twitter) to report on the issue . This is the type of transparency that will keep Coinbase relevant for years to come. This is what the crypto industry desperately needs. This is what has allowed the company to become the custodial partner of the largest financial institutions in the world. It is what will allow the company to continue innovating and compounding in an industry widely criticized for its lack of utility and value destruction. Coinbase isn't betting on crypto's future success. It's building the infrastructure to define and facilitate that success. I rate the company a Buy.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4790480-coinbase-winner-bitcoin-institutional-adoption-initiate-with-buy?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","COIN",cryptocompare

Technical indicators signal surged accumulation accompanying the alt’s recovery. For instance, the Chaikin Money Flow has climbed from -0.04 in mid-May to +0.06 at press time. Source – TradingView Such trends confirm continued asset purchases, indicating organic demand behind SPX6900’s ongoing recovery. Moreover, Coinalyze data shows buyers accumulated 1.27 million tokens in the past day, with 506,000 positive Delta. The dynamic shift in exchange activity also supports the changing trend. SPX’s earlier recoveries halted as sellers dominated trading platforms with positive net flow. Now, exchange net flows have been in the negative region for three successive days, reading -$620 at press time, indicating outflows outpacing inflows. That signals heightened demand as withdrawals from the market outshine deposits. Coinglass statistics support the upside bias. SPX’s Open Interest jumped 35% to $69.41 million. That shows traders executing new long positions as they anticipated extended gains. Amplified spot demand, exchange outflows, and dominant long positions confirm stable price actions, not hype-driven recoveries. The bullish crossover between the SPX price and the Relative Strength Index demonstrates buyer resurgence. SPX’s current price action The alt trades at $1.01 with a massive upside momentum supported by organic demand. Chart by Coinmarketcap SPX6900 has validated its recovery catalysts in the past 24 hours. Continued demand will help SPX hold above $1 and target $1.3. That would translate to a nearly 30% surge from the altcoin’s current market price. Such trends could propel SPX6900 to the January 19 peak of $1.8. Nevertheless, SPX hovers at a key juncture. It has gained over 70% this month after stable uptrends from the 8 May low of $04824. The massive returns will likely attract profit-taking. That could postpone SPX6900’s anticipated surges in the near term. The Relative Strength Index reads 70, highlighting overbought conditions. Possible profit booking could catalyze corrections to $0.9073. Losing the $0.8 barrier will invalidate SPX’s short-term recoveries. Broad market developments will also shape SPX6900’s trajectory in the upcoming sessions. Bitcoin hovers at $108,359 and should close above $110K for continued gains in the short term. Renowned analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that Bitcoin hasn’t topped, suggesting more gains. He stated: Bitcoin (BTC) traders are currently sitting on 27% average profits. Historically, things start to look toppy once profits exceed 40%. Source – Ali on X Thus, Bitcoin could rally further before potential profit-taking materializes. Such trends will support SPX6900’s anticipated surges.

Despite being already flush with cash, the company offered debt in March to raise the funds for BTC acquisitions in a strategic shift to include crypto in its financial strategy. GameStop Acquires 4,710 Bitcoin According to a Form 8-K filing , the Grapevine, Texas-headquartered firm purchased 4,710 BTC after completing a $1.5 billion convertible notes offering in early April. https://twitter.com/gamestop/status/1927679297252364502 The Bitcoin investment follows GameStop’s move to diversify its balance sheet. Rumors about GameStop’s interest in Bitcoin began to circulate in February after GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen posted an uncaptioned photo of himself with Michael Saylor, Strategy Executive Chairman and a vocal advocate for corporate Bitcoin treasury reserves. The rumors intensified days later after a CNBC report days later revealed that the favorite meme stock of the pandemic era was considering investments in alternative assets, including BTC. Then, in March, the company’s board unanimously greenlit a plan to adopt the benchmark crypto as a treasury reserve asset. Following The Strategy Bitcoin Playbook Saylor’s Strategy has issued billions of dollars of convertible senior notes, raising capital to purchase more Bitcoin than it could otherwise. GameStop now joins a slew of other companies like Tokyo-listed Metaplanet that have added Bitcoin to their balance sheet in a playbook popularized by Strategy. According to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net, over 210 firms worldwide hold BTC, with Strategy remaining the largest corporate holder of the apex crypto. At press time, Strategy holds 580,250 BTC, or just over $45 billion worth, since it began buying Bitcoin in 2020.

2025-05-28T14:30:40.000Z,"Wells Fargo Raises Price Target for One US Financial Stock That’s Up 48% Since Liberation Day-Induced Crash: Report","Wells Fargo is updating its outlook on Ares Management Corporation (ARES), reportedly issuing a bullish forecast for the $52 billion global alternative investment manager. Wells Fargo analyst Michael Brown is raising Ares’s price target from $182 to $189, while reiterating an overweight rating, reports Insider Monkey. Brown says the firm’s ongoing performance and future prospects remain strong. Ares Management reported $1.04 billion in the first quarter of the year, a 38.21% increase. The firm is also well-positioned to perform well despite the market volatility caused by US President Donald Trump’s announced tariffs on April 2nd, so-called “Liberation Day,” and other geopolitical events, which has led to a decline in liquid credit and equity markets due to traditional capital providers shifting to a risk-off position, according to the report. Ares plummeted to a low of about $110 on April 4th, but has since surged about 48% since then. According to the analysis, Ares’ business model allows it to avoid having to sell assets amid market uncertainty due “to its management fee-centric approach, low balance sheet leverage and reliance on long-dated and locked-up third-party capital.” Over 72% of Ares’s total assets under management are in credit-related products. Also in the first quarter of the year, Ares raised over $20 billion in gross new capital commitments, the company’s highest Q1 fundraising on record. ARES is trading for $164.60 at time of writing, up more than 2% in the last 24 hours.

El Salvador Plays Defiant Game With IMF Bitcoin Rules The new Bitcoin acquisition, announced by El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office, came shortly after IMF staff and El Salvadoran authorities reached a staff-level agreement on the first review of the 40-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF). EL SALVADOR JUST BOUGHT MORE BITCOIN pic.twitter.com/HlEJMkFIOW — The Bitcoin Office (@bitcoinofficesv) May 28, 2025 In March, El Salvador signed a deal with the IMF to receive a $3.5 billion loan package. Bitcoin was stripped of its mandatory legal tender status, meaning merchants no longer need to accept the currency on a mandatory basis. As part of the agreement, El Salvador must fulfill its previous obligations regarding limiting further government involvement in Bitcoin, and it will have to wind down public sector involvement with the Chivo wallet by the end of July. “On Bitcoin, efforts will continue to ensure that the total amount of Bitcoin held across all government-owned wallets remains unchanged,” the IMF stated. Moreover, the deal prohibited the “voluntary accumulation of the premier crypto by the public sector,” meaning that El Salvador wouldn’t be allowed to keep stockpiling BTC if it wanted to keep complying with the loan package. Despite earlier commitments to limit state involvement in crypto activities, the country’s Bitcoin Office has continued to boost its reserves with frequent purchases. Nayib Bukele’s government now holds roughly 6,190 BTC, a sum worth approximately $673 million, according to Arkham Intelligence. President Bukele, who has made Bitcoin the star of his global image, has asserted that his government will continue to acquire one BTC every day as part of the country’s Bitcoin treasury strategy. Bukele recently revealed in a post on the X social media site that the country’s Bitcoin stash is sitting at an unrealized profit of $386 million, an over 130% gain on its total Bitcoin investment.

2025-05-28T14:27:08.000Z,"Will Ethereum (ETH) Make the Expected Attack and Exceed $3,000? Analyst Answered!","The largest altcoin, Ethereum (ETH), which has been performing poorly against Bitcoin (BTC) for a long time, has made a big attack in recent weeks and rose from $ 1,800 levels to $ 2,700 levels. As ETH enters a consolidation period, the market expects the price to exceed $ 3,000 in the short term. While there is curiosity about whether Ethereum will make a big attack again, market analyst Omkar Godbole evaluated the possibility of ETH exceeding $ 3,000. Accordingly, the analyst argued that Ethereum has formed an ascending triangle pattern that points to a potential increase above $3,000. Stating that the ETH chart has formed an ascending triangle pattern, the analyst said that it seems ready to exceed $3,000. The ascending triangle forms a pattern that repeatedly limits upward sloping movements with a resistance line. The ascending triangle formation is generally considered a bullish formation, and after the break of the horizontal resistance line, a rise as high as a flagpole is usually expected. At this point, the analyst noted that Ethereum has faced resistance at $2,735 several times in the last two weeks, and said that ETH has formed higher lows, indicating an ascending triangle. Stating that higher lows indicate increasing buying pressure, the analyst stated that this pressure increases the potential for ETH to rise above $3,000. “An expected upward breakout of the ascending triangle pattern would signal that ETH has resumed its rally from the lows seen in April at $1,390 and open the door for a move above $3,000.” The analyst also noted that the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) is very close to breaking above the 100-day SMA, which he said supports the bullish case. Finally, the analyst also warned that a downward breakout of the triangle formation on the Ethereum chart could invalidate the bull case and cause stronger selling pressure. *This is not investment advice.

XRP is now down by 2% in a week and by 12% in the past fortnight, although the fourth-biggest coin in the market keeps an impressive 330% increase in the last 12 months. The token’s moves over the past few weeks have followed a sharp decline in active XRP Ledger addresses , indicating a pronounced decline in interest among traders. Yet this isn’t likely to continue for much longer, with the approach of XRP ETFs later in the year signalling very good things for the long-term XRP price prediction . XRP Price Prediction: Onchain Activity Flashes Danger – Big Drop Possible? If we look at CryptoQuant’s active addresses chart for XRP, we see that addresses have declined from a peak of 108,000 on December 2 to a six-month low of 23,000 today. Source: CryptoQuant This is an 80% decline, which is far in excess of the 30.5% drop in price XRP has suffered since the coin reached a seven-year high of $3.31 on January 18. This arguably signals a big drop in interest, yet one positive is that active addresses are still higher now than they were for much of the two-year period prior to the Trump rally beginning in November 2024. As such, it would be rash to assume that this decline predicts a big incoming drop in the XRP price, especially when inactive addresses can indicate longer term holding. But if we look at the XRP chart today, we see that its indicators have been weakening over the past couple of days, signalling more losses (although not necessarily steep losses) in the near term. Its RSI (purple) has dropped from 70 in early May to just under 50 today, and it could continue to fall over the next few days. Source: TradingView Based on such factors, it would be reasonable to predict that the XRP price could drop back to $2.20 or a bit lower this week or the next. But XRP’s strong fundamentals would point to a fairly quick rebound, potentially to $2.50 or higher by the end of July. In 2024 BTC ETFs launched, BTC went from $35K – $99K. In 2025 XRP ETFs will launch. Can you guess how much XRP price would be by 12/31/25?

New Presale Tokens Could Rally Soon As strong as XRP remains, one way of boosting your exposure to potential gains is to diversify into smaller tokens, which during their initial growth spurts can vastly outpace the market. This would include presale tokens, with the biggest sales sometimes leading to big rallies when the corresponding tokens list for the first time. The biggest presale happening right now belongs to Solaxy (SOLX), a Solana-based token that has now raised a whopping $41.5 million in its offering. $SOLX reigns supreme. 41M Raised! pic.twitter.com/uEUXlekkL0 — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) May 27, 2025 This is an impressive sum, with Solaxy also boasting an X account with 77,000 followers , another early sign of its potential future popularity. And what’s giving Solaxy so much potential is the fact that it’s launching a layer-two network for Solana, one which promises to make the Solana ecosystem more efficient for traders. Its L2 will provide ultra-low transaction fees and confirmation times, while also enabling instant bridging between itself and Solana. The project is also in the process of developing its own DEX , with Solaxy aiming to become an important hub for meme tokens and DeFi. And given that SOLX will be necessary to pay Solaxy’s transaction fees, the token could become very sought-after very soon. Solaxy’s presale will end in 19 days, but you can still join it by going to its official website . SOLX is selling at its final presale price of $0.001738, and will list soon after the sale ends.

2025-05-28T14:15:00.000Z,"Elderly crypto investors are getting scammed: Teach them these key safety tips","Why are seniors being targeted in crypto scams? Scammers prey on seniors because they view them as financially secure, trusting and less familiar with rapidly evolving technology. Let’s understand why seniors are key targets. Perception of wealth: Many older adults have retirement savings or pensions, making them lucrative targets. Lower tech fluency: Navigating crypto wallets , private keys and blockchain concepts can be intimidating, something scammers exploit. Embarrassment prevents reporting: Victims often feel ashamed, making them less likely to report the crime. Crypto is irreversible: Once funds are sent via Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, there’s no reversing the transaction. That’s a dream scenario for scammers. According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), seniors report growing losses linked to cryptocurrency investment fraud , romance scams and government impersonation. In South Carolina’s Beaufort County alone, seniors reported over $3.1 million in crypto scam losses in 2024. And these scams are becoming more sophisticated. AI tools can now clone voices, spoof caller IDs and create fake websites that mimic legitimate exchanges or financial institutions to steal from unsuspecting seniors. Examples of crypto scams targeting older adults From crypto romance fraud in Cambodia targeting British pensioners to ATM scams in Minnesota and impersonation schemes across the US, scammers have stolen millions by preying on older adults’ trust and unfamiliarity with digital assets. 1. Cambodian scam compounds exploiting British pensioners In Bavet, Cambodia, scam compounds operated by networks linked to the Chinese mafia have been uncovered. These operations enslave trafficked workers, forcing them to participate in romance and cryptocurrency fraud . British pensioners have been prime targets, suffering significant losses.. One victim from the West Midlands lost over 250,000 British pounds ($340,000). These scams often employ “pig-butchering” tactics , cultivating trust online before executing large-scale financial fraud. 2. Crypto ATM scams in Minnesota In Minnesota, over 5,500 incidents involving cryptocurrency kiosks led to losses exceeding $189 million in 2023. Seniors were the most vulnerable victims, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the stolen funds. Scammers often direct victims to transfer funds using QR codes tied to fraudulent accounts. Cities like Stillwater have implemented bans on crypto ATMs to protect residents. 3. Romance scam targeting a disabled woman in the UK Lisa Nock, a 44-year-old woman from Staffordshire with autism and mobility issues, fell victim to a romance scam after being targeted on Instagram by someone impersonating Australian TV vet Dr. Chris Brown. Over 18 months, the scammer manipulated her into transferring £11,000 in cryptocurrency, claiming the funds were for flights, visas and hiring a substitute vet. Lisa eventually realized the deceit and reported the fraud to authorities. 4. Government or bank impersonators demanding crypto payments Scammers may impersonate the IRS, Social Security Administration, Medicare or local law enforcement. Their script is simple: You’re in legal trouble or owe back taxes, and the only way to avoid arrest or penalties is to pay in Bitcoin. This tactic has been used across the US. In South Carolina, a retired healthcare worker named Marianne was told she missed jury duty and owed $7,500. Following fake sheriff’s instructions, she fed the cash into a Coinstar crypto ATM, which instantly converted her money to Bitcoin and sent it straight to scammers. 5. Ohio woman loses life savings in cryptocurrency investment scam An Ohio woman lost her life savings in a cryptocurrency investment scam that defrauded victims of about $4.9 million. The scheme involved 33 identified victims nationwide, with five more accounts under FBI investigation. Did you know? A $243 million Bitcoin heist involving a fake Google call spiraled into a real-world kidnapping plot straight out of a Netflix thriller. 7 Key safety tips every elderly crypto investor should know Elderly investors should follow key safety steps like never sending crypto to strangers, verifying suspicious contacts, enabling two-factor authentication, avoiding public WiFi and discussing large transactions with trusted family before acting. Here are the key safety tips every elderly crypto investor should be aware of: Never send crypto to strangers: If someone you’ve never met in person asks for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, it’s almost certainly a scam. This includes social media , messages on Facebook, emails from supposed tech support or even someone you’ve been chatting with on a dating site. No legitimate person or organization will randomly ask for crypto. If you’re being told, “Send me $500 and I’ll send back $1,000,” you’re being conned. Always assume unsolicited crypto requests are fraudulent. Double-check all contacts: If you get a call, email, or text from a bank, the IRS or even a family member in crisis, don’t respond immediately. Call the official number on your bank card or government website to verify. Use trusted wallets and exchanges only: Stick to platforms with strong security and regulation like Coinbase, Kraken and Binance.US . Avoid apps from unknown websites or links in emails. Watch for pressure tactics: Scammers thrive on urgency; you only have two hours to pay; act now to claim your prize. Real financial institutions do not use this kind of pressure. Set up two-factor authentication (2FA): All crypto wallets and exchange accounts should have 2FA enabled. This adds a second layer of protection even if a password is stolen. Avoid public WiFi for crypto transactions: Never send crypto or log in to financial apps over public WiFi at coffee shops, airports or hotels. These networks are often unsecured and can be intercepted by hackers. Use your home WiFi or mobile data instead, and ensure your device has up-to-date antivirus protection. Talk to family before big transactions: Before sending large amounts of crypto or any money, have a quick conversation with someone you trust. Scammers often isolate victims and make them feel they must act alone. Encourage seniors to adopt a simple rule: If it’s more than $100, talk to someone first. A five-minute phone call could prevent a five-figure mistake. Think grandma got scammed? Here’s what to do immediately If you’ve been scammed, act fast: Report it to the crypto exchange (they might freeze the funds ), file a fraud report with the FTC or Chainabuse and contact elder support services for guidance and protection. 1. Report the scam to the exchange If the funds were sent through Coinbase, Binance or another exchange, contact them right away. Some may be able to freeze accounts if action is taken quickly. 2. File a report with law enforcement and the FTC Call your local police department. Report fraud to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov. You can also report crypto fraud at Chainabuse.com, a trusted crypto crime reporting platform. 3. Contact elder support resources ElderCare Locator (USA): Connects older adults and families to local services, including Adult Protective Services for financial exploitation cases. Action Fraud (UK): The UK’s national fraud reporting center for scams, including those involving crypto. Scamwatch, ACCC (Australia): Provides scam alerts and allows reporting of cryptocurrency and financial scams affecting seniors. Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (Canada): A national agency for reporting and tracking fraud, including crypto scams targeting older adults. National Council on Aging – NCOA (US): Offers educational resources and scam prevention tools for seniors and caregivers. Age UK (UK): Provides advice and support for older people facing financial abuse, including online and crypto scams. Did you know? Hackers have been caught selling counterfeit smartphones infected with the Triada Trojan, malware that steals crypto and sensitive data by deeply embedding itself in the device’s system. Is crypto safe for seniors? Yes, but only with proper education and safeguards. Cryptocurrency can be empowering, offering independence and investment opportunities. However, seniors can become easy targets without a strong awareness of the risks. Scammers increasingly target seniors through sophisticated tactics like fake investment platforms, romance scams and impersonation of government or tech support personnel. These schemes often involve urgent demands, emotional manipulation or unfamiliar technologies like crypto ATMs. To minimize risk, seniors should be educated on the basics of cryptocurrency, recognize common fraud tactics, use reputable platforms and involve trusted family or advisers before making transactions. Awareness and vigilance are essential to protect both assets and peace of mind in the digital age. As crypto continues to go mainstream, scammers are adapting fast. Don’t let your loved ones get rug-pulled or emotionally manipulated into losing everything. Share these tips. Stay involved. And when in doubt, always verify before sending funds.",cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/elderly-crypto-investors-are-getting-scammed-teach-them-these-key-safety-tips?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION","investors",cryptocompare

Tariffs and geopolitical concerns remain top of investors’ minds, a scenario that has stocks looking to knit together another winning streak. Ahead of Nvidia’s (NVDA) highly anticipated earnings release after the bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened 56 points higher, while the S&P 500 rose 0.2% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.26%. Stocks traded largely unchanged from Tuesday levels, as investor sentiment was influenced by trade dynamics, U.S. economic data, and the global geopolitical outlook. Adding to the caution is the market’s close attention to what the global chipmaker reveals in its upcoming earnings report. Wall Street is expected to use Nvidia’s results and guidance as a gauge for the current tariff landscape and to assess how Big Tech is preparing for potential economic impacts. If Nvidia delivers better-than-expected numbers, the broader market could respond with a sharp upside move.

Stockton shared her outlook in an interview with CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ on Wednesday. Other than focus on Nvidia, investors will be keen on minutes from May 2025’s Federal Reserve’s meeting.

Her response hints at a deeper concern around Bitcoin’s long-term security, government actions, and rising unease. A Symbol of Unity — Or a Sign of Trouble? In a recent tweet post, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse talked about the famous Skull of Satoshi, a sculpture that started as a symbol of criticism toward Bitcoin’s energy usage. But over time, it has become a sign of Bitcoin’s endurance. Garlinghouse said that as blockchain technology matures, it’s time for different crypto communities — like BTC, XRP, and others — to work together.

2025-05-28T14:10:21.000Z,"Bitcoin Price: Crucial Support Levels Emerge Amid Consolidation","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price: Crucial Support Levels Emerge Amid Consolidation The cryptocurrency market is currently witnessing a fascinating phase for the king of digital assets, Bitcoin (BTC). After a significant run-up, the Bitcoin price is now consolidating, hovering above the psychological $100,000 mark. This period of sideways movement often precedes a larger move, making it a critical time for investors and traders to understand the underlying dynamics. Understanding the Current BTC Price Action Consolidation is a market phase where the asset’s price trades within a relatively narrow range, indicating a balance between buying and selling pressure. For BTC price , this period above $100,000 suggests that despite reaching a major milestone, the market is taking a breath, digesting recent gains, and perhaps accumulating energy for the next directional move. This is a stark contrast to rapid parabolic rises or sharp corrections, pointing towards a more mature market structure developing around these higher price levels. Several factors contribute to this consolidation: Profit-Taking: Some investors who bought at lower prices are likely taking profits. New Entrants: Buyers are stepping in at the $100,000+ level, seeing it as a potential new floor. Market Uncertainty: Global macroeconomic factors and regulatory news can cause hesitation. Whale Activity: Large holders (whales) often play a significant role during consolidation phases, either accumulating or distributing. Observing how long this consolidation phase lasts and the volume associated with it can offer clues about the market’s conviction for the next move. Identifying Key Bitcoin Support Levels In any market, identifying reliable support levels is crucial for understanding where price declines might pause or reverse. According to analysis highlighted by Cointelegraph and insights from analysts like Keith Alan, a significant Bitcoin support level is potentially forming around the $94,000 area. This level isn’t arbitrary; it aligns closely with a key technical indicator: the 21-week moving average. The 21-week moving average is often watched by long-term investors and traders as it can represent a dynamic support or resistance line over medium-term trends. A retest of this level, should a correction occur from the current consolidation range, would be a key test for the bullish structure. Holding this level would reinforce its significance as a strong floor, potentially providing a springboard for future price appreciation. Why is $94,000 important? Alignment with 21-Week MA: This technical indicator is a widely followed benchmark for trend health. Previous Price Action: Often, round numbers or previous resistance levels can turn into support. Psychological Importance: While not a round number like $100K, $94K represents a notable dip that might attract buyers looking for a discount. While $94,000 is a prominent level, traders should also be aware of potential minor support zones within the current consolidation range, which could offer temporary bounces even if the price heads towards the 21-week MA. Navigating Bitcoin Resistance Levels Just as support levels indicate potential floors, resistance levels highlight areas where selling pressure is expected to be strong, potentially capping upward price movement. For the current market structure, the analysis points to the $112,000 level as holding the highest concentration of selling pressure. This means that as the Bitcoin price approaches this mark, a significant number of market participants are likely placing sell orders, either to take profits or enter short positions. Breaking through a strong resistance level like $112,000 typically requires substantial buying volume and market conviction. A failed attempt to break resistance can lead to a price pullback, potentially back towards the consolidation range or even towards the identified support levels. Key Resistance Points: $112,000: Identified as a major hurdle due to high selling pressure. Above $112,000: Subsequent resistance could be found at historical highs or based on Fibonacci extension levels. Psychological Levels: Round numbers above $112K (e.g., $120K, $125K) can also act as minor resistance. Successfully clearing the $112,000 resistance would be a strong bullish signal, potentially opening the door for a move towards new all-time highs. The Influence of BTC Whales on Market Dynamics The actions of large holders, often referred to as ‘whales’, have a disproportionate impact on the cryptocurrency market due to their sheer volume of assets. The observation that whales are increasing their holdings during this consolidation phase is a noteworthy point from the Cointelegraph report. This accumulation could be interpreted as a bullish sign, suggesting that these large players anticipate higher prices in the future and are using the current sideways movement to build their positions without causing significant price spikes. However, whale activity is a double-edged sword. While accumulation can signal confidence, whales can also quickly sell large portions of their holdings, leading to sharp price drops. Furthermore, leveraged trades by large entities, like those mentioned regarding James Wynn, can amplify market movements. High leverage means even small price changes can lead to liquidations, which can cascade and trigger larger volatility events. Understanding whale behavior is a key component of effective Bitcoin market analysis . On-chain data analysis tools often track the movements of wallets holding significant amounts of BTC, providing insights into whether these large players are primarily in accumulation or distribution mode. Actionable Insights from Bitcoin Market Analysis Given the current market structure and the factors at play, what are the actionable insights for those involved in the Bitcoin market? Monitor Key Levels: Keep a close watch on the $100,000 consolidation range, the $94,000 potential support, and the $112,000 resistance. Price action around these levels will be highly informative. Understand Consolidation: Recognize that consolidation can resolve in either direction. It’s a period of indecision before a potential breakout or breakdown. Consider Whale Activity: While not a guaranteed predictor, whale accumulation during consolidation can be a positive sign. However, remain cautious of potential volatility from large trades. Use Risk Management: Given the potential for sharp moves out of consolidation, employing strategies like stop-loss orders is crucial to protect capital. Stay Informed: Keep up with fundamental news, macroeconomic trends, and technical analysis updates that could influence the market. This period requires patience and careful observation rather than impulsive trading based on minor price fluctuations within the range. Challenges and Considerations Despite the potential for identifying clear support and resistance, the crypto market is inherently volatile. Unexpected news events, shifts in global sentiment, or large liquidation cascades triggered by leveraged positions can cause rapid deviations from expected price movements. Therefore, relying solely on technical levels without considering the broader market context and risk management principles is not advisable. Conclusion: What’s Next for Bitcoin? The current phase of consolidation above $100,000 is a pivotal moment for the Bitcoin price . The presence of significant potential support around $94,000, near the 21-week moving average, offers a key level to watch should a pullback occur. Conversely, the $112,000 level represents a major resistance hurdle that needs to be overcome for the uptrend to continue with conviction. The backdrop of whale accumulation adds an intriguing layer to the Bitcoin market analysis , potentially signaling underlying strength, but the risk of volatility from large players and leveraged positions remains. Ultimately, the resolution of this consolidation phase will likely dictate Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory. Whether it’s a bullish breakout above $112,000 or a retest of the crucial $94,000 support, staying informed and prepared for volatility is key in this exciting market.

2025-05-28T14:00:32.000Z,"Russia peddles Europe-sanctioned excess energy to crypto miners","Russian crypto miners can use natural gas, in excess since Europe started cutting energy purchases from Russia, to mint digital coins, a government official has suggested. The proposal comes after the presentation of a roadmap in Brussels meant to steer the European Union away from Russian gas, oil and nuclear fuel imports in the coming years. Natural gas should power crypto mining in the Far East, minister says Natural gas, of which Russia has surplus quantities since it started losing European markets, can be utilized to power cryptocurrency mining operations, according to Aleksey Chekunkov, head of Russia’s Ministry for the Development of the Far East and the Arctic. Quoted by the Tass news agency, Chekunkov insisted mining farms should not tap into the electricity distributed to businesses and households. Speaking to reporters in the city of Khabarovsk, administrative center of the Far Eastern Federal District, the minister elaborated: “You can mine using your own resources, using gas. We have a lot of gas that we used to sell to Europe. Now it’s in the ground. Please, install power plants and mine.” The expanding crypto mining industry, which Moscow legalized and regulated last year, has been blamed for energy shortages in a number of Russian regions, including Russia’s “ mining capital ,” Irkutsk Oblast. A ban on mining in parts of the country, which began as a seasonal measure during the cold winter months, has grown into a permanent prohibition in about a dozen territories, including the Russian republics in the Caucasus and the occupied lands of Ukraine. On June 4, a government commission will consider proposals to introduce a year-round mining ban in another five regions facing power deficits – Transbaikal, Buryatia, northern Karelia, the Penza region, and parts of Khakassia. Meanwhile, Russian Deputy Minister of Energy Evgeny Grabchak revealed last week that the federal government may ask crypto miners to move to the north of the country. The idea is to utilize currently idle generation capacities and transmission infrastructure, including at depleted oil fields. Europe speeds up plan to end dependence on Russian energy The proposal to power Bitcoin mining farms with excess natural gas in Russia comes after the recent adoption of a roadmap in Brussels to completely eliminate the EU’s dependency on Russian energy within a couple of years. The document was presented on May 6, around the third anniversary of the approval of a plan to phase out Russian fossil fuels. The latter was published just two weeks after Russian forces invaded Ukraine in February 2022. War-related sanctions have led to a significant reduction in energy imports from the Russian Federation over the course of the past three years, Euronews noted in a report this week. The broadcaster detailed: “Oil fell from 27% in 2022 to 3% in 2025, gas fell from 45% to 19% in the same period and coal, which at the time accounted for 50% of EU consumption, stopped entering the EU altogether.” However, the European Commission admitted that “despite the significant progress achieved under the REPowerEU plan , and via 16 sanction packages introduced since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the EU saw a rebound in Russian gas imports in 2024.” Its new REPowerEU roadmap now pushes for a “coordinated, secure and gradual phase out of Russian gas, oil and nuclear energy imports.” It sets a clear target – to end Russian gas imports to the European Union by 2027 and requires member states to submit national plans to reach the goal. Last year, 10 EU countries imported 52 billion cubic meters of Russian natural gas, three bought 13 million tonnes of oil and seven member states acquired 2,800 tonnes of enriched uranium and nuclear fuel, the Commission’s stats show. Russian energy exports to the EU returned €23 billion to Moscow in 2024. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

2025-05-28T14:00:00.000Z,"How to mine Bitcoin at home in 2025","Key takeaways Lottery mining is cheap and fun, but don’t count on hitting a block. Solo ASIC mining gives you complete control, but it’s a long-odds game. Pool mining is the most practical way to earn steady payouts at home. Cloud mining saves you the hassle but usually isn’t worth the cost. Bitcoin is rapidly gaining legitimacy, and you couldn’t be blamed for wanting to peek behind the curtain to see how it’s made. Throughout 2024 and into 2025, you've seen a whirlwind of institutional investment from companies like Strategy , which continues to aggressively accumulate Bitcoin ( BTC ), and Metaplanet, Japan’s listed company that recently adopted BTC as a treasury reserve asset. Moreover, on the regulatory front, the return of a US President Donald Trump administration signals a friendlier stance toward crypto, with talk of rolling back SEC overreach and possibly supporting US-based mining . Across the Atlantic, the MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation has gone into effect in the EU, offering clearer guidelines and reducing regulatory uncertainty for retail investors and miners alike. Then there's the price. Bitcoin finally broke the long-anticipated $100,000 resistance level in early 2025, following a post-halving supply shock and increased ETF-driven demand. As institutions pour in and supply tightens, more individuals are re-evaluating how to get involved. Whatever your motivation, one thing’s certain: You want to mine from the comfort of your home. This article will explain four realistic ways to mine Bitcoin at home in 2025, what gear you’ll need, how much it might cost, and what kind of returns you can expect. Did you know? Bitcoin mining has developed into a sizable industry, with revenues growing by over 6,700% from 2021 to 2025. Option 1: Lottery mining – Low power, high risk, rare rewards If you’re working with a limited budget but still want to try Bitcoin mining, lottery mining offers an interesting — if highly unpredictable — way. In July 2024, a solo miner using just three TH/s of hash power — roughly what you’d get from two small USB devices — successfully mined an entire Bitcoin block. The reward was 3.192 BTC, worth over $200,000 at the time. Statistically, that kind of result should take thousands of years. But with some luck and help from the Solo CKPool platform, it actually happened. These wins are extremely rare, but they do happen. And that’s what keeps some people interested. Most lottery miners use small, low-power devices like the Bitaxe HEX, an open-source miner built with actual Antminer chips. It runs at around three TH/s, costs about $600 and pairs easily with a Raspberry Pi. Another popular option is the GekkoScience R909, a USB miner running at 1.5 TH/s and a favorite among hobbyists. These devices aren’t built for steady income. They’re closer to digital slot machines, but ones that still contribute to securing the Bitcoin network . So why do people do it? Three main reasons: Running an independent node supports the health and resilience of the Bitcoin network. It’s a good way to get familiar with how mining works . A single successful block can be worth a lot, and it’s all yours if it happens. For most, it’s not about making money. It’s about the challenge and the curiosity, like building a custom PC or restoring a vintage radio. And yes, it also looks great plugged in on a shelf, blinking quietly under a glowing Bitcoin lamp. Next up: ASICs, the heavy-duty hardware of serious miners. Did you know? Solo CKPool is designed for independent miners who want to submit their shares directly to the Bitcoin network. Unlike traditional mining pools, if you’re successful here, the entire reward goes to you (minus a small pool fee). There’s no revenue sharing, no splitting blocks. Option 2: ASIC mining – Solo mining with real hardware If lottery mining is like buying a single ticket and hoping for a lucky break, solo mining with an ASIC is showing up with a small stack. Your chances improve, but it’s still a long shot. ASICs — application-specific integrated circuits — are purpose-built for Bitcoin mining. In 2025, high-end models like the Antminer S21 Hydro deliver impressive performances, reaching around 400 terahashes per second with improved energy efficiency over previous generations. Let’s look at the numbers. The Bitcoin network currently runs at around 500 exahashes per second. With one S21 Hydro, you’d control roughly 0.00008% of the total hashrate . That gives you odds of about one in 8.6 billion of finding a block on any given day. It's still extremely unlikely, but it's far better than what you’d get with low-power USB miners. To meaningfully improve your chances, you’d need to scale up. Running 20 ASICs could put you past eight petahashes per second, enough, in theory, to find a block about once a year. But that setup requires significant capital, proper ventilation or immersion cooling and a reliable energy supply. Even then, outcomes are unpredictable. The Bitcoin network might find several blocks in an hour or none at all. Still, some miners go this route. The appeal is simple: If you do find a block on your own, you keep the entire reward , currently over three BTC, plus transaction fees . There is no need to split the payout with anyone else. But for most people, even those with top-tier ASICs, solo mining remains a high-risk approach with uncertain rewards. Did you know? The cost of the latest mining equipment has significantly decreased, with prices around $16 per terahash in 2025, compared to $80 per terahash in 2022, enhancing mining efficiency. That’s why many home miners eventually turn to a more consistent and scalable model: Joining a mining pool. Option 3: Pool mining – Strength in numbers If solo mining is a long shot, pool mining is the practical alternative. It’s how most home miners approach Bitcoin mining in 2025 – and with good reason. By joining a mining pool , you combine your hashrate with thousands of other participants. When the pool successfully mines a block, the reward is split based on each miner’s contribution. You’re no longer chasing a rare solo win, but earning smaller, steady payouts. It’s more predictable, less risky and not so dependent on luck. For example, if you’re running an Antminer S21 Hydro at 400 TH/s, that hash power earns you a proportional share of the pool’s rewards. You’ll likely see consistent daily income tied directly to your contribution. The largest pools today — Foundry USA, Antpool, ViaBTC, F2Pool — handle thousands of blocks every month. Many offer FPPS (Full Pay Per Share) models, where you’re paid for every valid share you submit, regardless of whether a block is found that day. Others use PPLNS (Pay Per Last N Shares), which only pays out when a block is discovered, but can result in slightly higher returns over time. The choice depends on how much payout fluctuation you're comfortable with. Setting things up is straightforward: Create an account with your chosen pool. Point your ASIC miner to the pool’s server. Add your Bitcoin payout address. Monitor your stats from the pool’s web dashboard. The returns won’t be massive, but they’ll be consistent, and for many miners, that’s exactly the goal. But what if you want to skip the hardware, the setup and the electricity costs altogether? What if you want exposure to mining without running a machine? That’s where cloud mining comes in. Option 4: Cloud mining – Mining without the machines Cloud mining lets you rent hash power from a remote provider, who runs the hardware on your behalf. You don’t have to manage equipment, deal with heat or noise, or worry about electricity costs. You simply buy a contract, and if all goes well, you will receive a portion of the mining rewards. On paper, it sounds straightforward. You select a provider, choose how much hash power you want to rent, and pay either upfront or through a subscription. The provider takes care of the infrastructure, including maintenance and cooling. In return, you earn a share of the Bitcoin mined, proportional to your rented power. But there are trade-offs – and risks. Cloud mining has gained a mixed reputation. Over the years, the space has been flooded with questionable operators, unrealistic return promises and outright scams. Many contracts turn out to be unprofitable once you factor in service fees, maintenance costs and the increasing difficulty of mining . You're effectively trusting a third party to operate machines you'll never see. That said, there are a few reputable providers. Platforms like NiceHash, BitDeer and ECOS have remained active in the space and offer flexible, transparent options. Some let you choose specific coins or pools. Still, even with these more established names, margins tend to be very thin, especially during bear markets or when global hashrates spike. Cloud mining may be worth considering if: You have limited access to cheap electricity or space for equipment. You’re looking for a low-effort way to get exposure to mining. You view it more as a speculative bet than a reliable income stream. However, if your goal is consistent returns or hands-on experience, then running your own gear or just buying and holding Bitcoin is likely a better use of resources. The bottom line There’s no single right way to mine Bitcoin at home in 2025. It comes down to what you’re after. Lottery mining is fun and cheap, but the odds are long. Going solo with an ASIC gives you full control and full risk. Mining pools are the go-to for steady, reliable payouts. Cloud mining offers convenience but not much certainty. If you're in it for the learning, the experience, or to slowly stack sats over time, there’s a setup that’ll fit. Just know what you’re getting into and why you’re doing it.",cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-mine-bitcoin-at-home?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","Mine bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-05-28T15:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the industry’s most overlooked asset","Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin DepotA new proposal to install Bitcoin ATMs in federal buildings highlights an important question: Can crypto truly go mainstream without a stronger physical presence? For years, the industry has focused on software and decentralization, but its reluctance to invest in real-world infrastructure is starting to show. Without physical access points, crypto risks becoming an exclusive, insiders-only system, rather than the open alternative it sets out to be.Everyone loves to talk about decentralization. There’s a good reason behind this. It defines the movement, shapes the technology, and supports the vision of a better financial system. While the industry focuses on code and algorithms, it lacks something basic. A decentralized system that exists only online is not genuinely decentralized.Physical infrastructure is the missing linkBitcoin’s physical infrastructure is the missing link. Without tools like ATMs, kiosks and access points at traditional retail locations, crypto remains out of reach for millions. Decentralization is not just about removing intermediaries. True decentralization requires expanding access. Without real-world touchpoints, even the most advanced network becomes limited to a closed circle of insiders.Recent: Arizona governor kills two crypto bills, cracks down on Bitcoin ATMsFor crypto to become mainstream, it must be easy to reach digitally and physically. That means showing up in places people already go and seamlessly integrating into people’s lives. Many groups in the American population still rely on cash or don’t have access to traditional banks. According to the latest Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation report, around 5.6 million American households don’t have a bank or savings account. Bitcoin ATMs give these users access without needing an app, a bank account or a crash course in blockchain. Most crypto tools today assume a level of financial fluency and infrastructure that millions simply do not have. The result is a digital-only ecosystem that locks out newcomers and widens the divide between early adopters and everyone else.User-friendly screen in the right placePhysical infrastructure helps address this issue. A Bitcoin ATM in a grocery store or gas station is not just a convenience but a bridge to financial inclusion. It is an invitation to someone who has never bought crypto, telling them they can participate. No bank, no broker, just a user-friendly screen in a familiar place.These machines also generate new economic activity. Local businesses benefit from increased foot traffic as the kiosks create passive revenue. For many communities, they provide access to a parallel financial system that was previously out of reach. This is a tangible example of crypto’s real-world utility. It is already happening, and it is measurable.The crypto industry’s blind spotThe industry often treats physical infrastructure like an afterthought. The obsession with building new digital solutions has created a blind spot. Innovation without usability builds systems that serve the few but exclude the many. If someone can buy Bitcoin (BTC) at the same place they buy their morning coffee, that is when crypto stops feeling like an obscure digital asset and starts becoming part of everyday life.As governments increase regulation, trusted and transparent interfaces will become more important. When operated within regulatory frameworks, Bitcoin ATMs offer a way to provide access between traditional finance and digital assets. They are familiar, easy to monitor and offer a more approachable entry point for the general public.Like any financial tool, Bitcoin ATMs have drawn scrutiny, particularly in cases where bad actors use them. Rather than dismissing the machines themselves, we should focus on investing in better oversight, stronger consumer education and smarter regulation. The overwhelming majority of people who use Bitcoin ATMs do so for legitimate reasons: to send remittances, to move money securely or to access digital assets without traditional banking barriers. Building trust does not mean avoiding or dismantling physical access, but improving it.The first time someone uses Bitcoin should not involve reading a white paper or navigating a tutorial. It should be as familiar as using an ATM or tapping a payment terminal. This is not an argument against innovation. Software and protocols will continue to evolve and play an important role. Physical infrastructure provides something those tools cannot: trust through presence. When people can see and use crypto in their neighborhood, at a store they already visit or in a format they already understand, it changes how they think about crypto and who it is for. According to Coin ATM Radar, there are over 30,000 Bitcoin ATMs in the US. It’s a meaningful start, but still only a small step toward widespread access. Crypto’s long-term success will depend not just on innovation but also on inclusion. That means building more than networks; it means building presence. When people can interact with crypto in the physical world, it stops being abstract and becomes usable. That is how digital finance becomes everyday finance.Opinion by: Scott Buchanan, chief operating officer of Bitcoin Depot.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-28T15:00:00.000Z,"Polygon-backed, high-yield blockchain launches for institutional adoption","The Katana Foundation, a nonprofit focused on decentralized finance (DeFi) development, is launching its private mainnet, aiming to unlock greater crypto asset productivity via deeper liquidity and higher yields for users.The Katana Foundation launched a DeFi-optimized, private blockchain, Katana, on May 28, incubated by GSR Markets and Polygon Labs, with the public mainnet launch set for June.The new blockchain will enable users to earn higher yields and explore DeFi in a “unique, optimized yield environment” that unlocks latent value through an ecosystem that makes every digital asset “work harder,” according to an announcement shared with Cointelegraph.“DeFi users deserve ecosystems that prioritize sustainable liquidity and consistent ‘real’ yields,” wrote Marc Boiron, the CEO of Polygon Labs and core contributor at Katana, adding: “Katana’s user-centric model turns inefficiencies into advantages, establishing a truly positive-sum environment for builders and participants alike.\""Source: KatanaKatana aims to solve the crypto industry’s liquidity fragmentation issue, which can cause significant price slippage, as one of the main barriers limiting institutional DeFi participationRelated: Here’s how abstraction minimizes fragmentation in DeFi, making it more fluidTo reduce the value slippage in DeFi, Katana’s blockchain concentrates the liquidity from numerous protocols and collects yields on all potential sources to create an ecosystem with deeper liquidity and more predictable lending and borrowing rates.2025 Institutional Investor Digital Assets Survey. Source: EY-ParthenonInstitutional participation in DeFi is set to triple over the next two years to 75% from 24% of 350 surveyed institutional investors, according to management consulting firm EY-Parthenon.To tackle the growing institutional liquidity needs, Katana’s liquidity pool is composed of multiple protocols, including lending protocol Morpho, decentralized exchange (DEX) Sushi and perpetual DEX Vertex, enabling users to trade “blue-chip assets” without needing crosschain transfers.Katana has also incorporated Conduit’s sequences and Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network.Related: Polygon CEO: DeFi must ditch hype for sustainable liquidityKatana to compound DeFi yield from “Ethereum-based opportunities”Katana aims to boost sustainable yield by building a cohesive DeFi ecosystem. For instance, VaultBridge deploys bridged assets into overcollateralized, curated lending strategies on Ethereum via Mopho to earn yield, which is routed back and compounded on Katana.The protocol will reinvest network fees and a portion of application revenue back into its ecosystem.“This reduces reliance on short-term incentives, generates consistent yield, and as it grows, acts as an increasingly stable backstop during periods of volatility and liquidity shocks,” Polygon Labs’ Boiron told Cointelegraph, adding:“Yield is distributed pro-rata to each chain using VaultBridge protocol based on their share of total deposits into VaultBridge.”“So if Katana supplies 20% of the total vault deposits, it receives 20% of the yield back,” he added.Katana will subsequently allocate its share of yield to users through boosted DeFi incentives across “core apps” such as Sushi, Morpho or Vertex. The yield is generated from “Ethereum-based opportunities and then enhanced through Katana’s core applications,” said Boiron.Polygon Labs’ CEO previously criticized DeFi protocols for fueling a cycle of “mercenary capital” by offering sky-high annual percentage yields (APYs) through token emissions. Beyond infrastructure-related limitations, regulatory uncertainty remains another significant barrier to institutional DeFi adoption.2025 Institutional Investor Digital Assets Survey.

2025-05-28T14:15:00.000Z,"Elderly crypto investors are getting scammed: Teach them these key safety tips","Why are seniors being targeted in crypto scams?              Scammers prey on seniors because they view them as financially secure, trusting and less familiar with rapidly evolving technology.Let’s understand why seniors are key targets.Perception of wealth: Many older adults have retirement savings or pensions, making them lucrative targets.Lower tech fluency: Navigating crypto wallets, private keys and blockchain concepts can be intimidating, something scammers exploit.Embarrassment prevents reporting: Victims often feel ashamed, making them less likely to report the crime.Crypto is irreversible: Once funds are sent via Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency, there’s no reversing the transaction. That’s a dream scenario for scammers.According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), seniors report growing losses linked to cryptocurrency investment fraud, romance scams and government impersonation. In South Carolina’s Beaufort County alone, seniors reported over $3.1 million in crypto scam losses in 2024.And these scams are becoming more sophisticated. AI tools can now clone voices, spoof caller IDs and create fake websites that mimic legitimate exchanges or financial institutions to steal from unsuspecting seniors.                  Examples of crypto scams targeting older adults              From crypto romance fraud in Cambodia targeting British pensioners to ATM scams in Minnesota and impersonation schemes across the US, scammers have stolen millions by preying on older adults’ trust and unfamiliarity with digital assets.1. Cambodian scam compounds exploiting British pensionersIn Bavet, Cambodia, scam compounds operated by networks linked to the Chinese mafia have been uncovered. These operations enslave trafficked workers, forcing them to participate in romance and cryptocurrency fraud. British pensioners have been prime targets, suffering significant losses.. One victim from the West Midlands lost over 250,000 British pounds ($340,000). These scams often employ “pig-butchering” tactics, cultivating trust online before executing large-scale financial fraud.2. Crypto ATM scams in MinnesotaIn Minnesota, over 5,500 incidents involving cryptocurrency kiosks led to losses exceeding $189 million in 2023. Seniors were the most vulnerable victims, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the stolen funds. Scammers often direct victims to transfer funds using QR codes tied to fraudulent accounts. Cities like Stillwater have implemented bans on crypto ATMs to protect residents.3. Romance scam targeting a disabled woman in the UKLisa Nock, a 44-year-old woman from Staffordshire with autism and mobility issues, fell victim to a romance scam after being targeted on Instagram by someone impersonating Australian TV vet Dr. Chris Brown. Over 18 months, the scammer manipulated her into transferring £11,000 in cryptocurrency, claiming the funds were for flights, visas and hiring a substitute vet. Lisa eventually realized the deceit and reported the fraud to authorities.4. Government or bank impersonators demanding crypto paymentsScammers may impersonate the IRS, Social Security Administration, Medicare or local law enforcement. Their script is simple: You’re in legal trouble or owe back taxes, and the only way to avoid arrest or penalties is to pay in Bitcoin.This tactic has been used across the US. In South Carolina, a retired healthcare worker named Marianne was told she missed jury duty and owed $7,500. Following fake sheriff’s instructions, she fed the cash into a Coinstar crypto ATM, which instantly converted her money to Bitcoin and sent it straight to scammers.5. Ohio woman loses life savings in cryptocurrency investment scam An Ohio woman lost her life savings in a cryptocurrency investment scam that defrauded victims of about $4.9 million. The scheme involved 33 identified victims nationwide, with five more accounts under FBI investigation.Did you know? A $243 million Bitcoin heist involving a fake Google call spiraled into a real-world kidnapping plot straight out of a Netflix thriller.                  7 Key safety tips every elderly crypto investor should know              Elderly investors should follow key safety steps like never sending crypto to strangers, verifying suspicious contacts, enabling two-factor authentication, avoiding public WiFi and discussing large transactions with trusted family before acting.Here are the key safety tips every elderly crypto investor should be aware of:Never send crypto to strangers: If someone you’ve never met in person asks for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies,  it’s almost certainly a scam. This includes social media, messages on Facebook, emails from supposed tech support or even someone you’ve been chatting with on a dating site. No legitimate person or organization will randomly ask for crypto. If you’re being told, “Send me $500 and I’ll send back $1,000,” you’re being conned. Always assume unsolicited crypto requests are fraudulent.Double-check all contacts: If you get a call, email, or text from a bank, the IRS or even a family member in crisis, don’t respond immediately. Call the official number on your bank card or government website to verify.Use trusted wallets and exchanges only: Stick to platforms with strong security and regulation like Coinbase, Kraken and Binance.US. Avoid apps from unknown websites or links in emails.Watch for pressure tactics: Scammers thrive on urgency; you only have two hours to pay; act now to claim your prize. Real financial institutions do not use this kind of pressure.Set up two-factor authentication (2FA): All crypto wallets and exchange accounts should have 2FA enabled. This adds a second layer of protection even if a password is stolen.Avoid public WiFi for crypto transactions: Never send crypto or log in to financial apps over public WiFi at coffee shops, airports or hotels. These networks are often unsecured and can be intercepted by hackers. Use your home WiFi or mobile data instead, and ensure your device has up-to-date antivirus protection.Talk to family before big transactions: Before sending large amounts of crypto or any money, have a quick conversation with someone you trust. Scammers often isolate victims and make them feel they must act alone. Encourage seniors to adopt a simple rule: If it’s more than $100, talk to someone first. A five-minute phone call could prevent a five-figure mistake.                  Think grandma got scammed? Here’s what to do immediately              If you’ve been scammed, act fast: Report it to the crypto exchange (they might freeze the funds), file a fraud report with the FTC or Chainabuse and contact elder support services for guidance and protection.1. Report the scam to the exchangeIf the funds were sent through Coinbase, Binance or another exchange, contact them right away. Some may be able to freeze accounts if action is taken quickly.2. File a report with law enforcement and the FTCCall your local police department.Report fraud to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.You can also report crypto fraud at Chainabuse.com, a trusted crypto crime reporting platform.3. Contact elder support resourcesElderCare Locator (USA): Connects older adults and families to local services, including Adult Protective Services for financial exploitation cases.Action Fraud (UK): The UK’s national fraud reporting center for scams, including those involving crypto.Scamwatch, ACCC (Australia): Provides scam alerts and allows reporting of cryptocurrency and financial scams affecting seniors.Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (Canada): A national agency for reporting and tracking fraud, including crypto scams targeting older adults.National Council on Aging – NCOA (US): Offers educational resources and scam prevention tools for seniors and caregivers.Age UK (UK): Provides advice and support for older people facing financial abuse, including online and crypto scams.Did you know? Hackers have been caught selling counterfeit smartphones infected with the Triada Trojan, malware that steals crypto and sensitive data by deeply embedding itself in the device’s system.                  Is crypto safe for seniors?              Yes, but only with proper education and safeguards. Cryptocurrency can be empowering, offering independence and investment opportunities. However, seniors can become easy targets without a strong awareness of the risks.Scammers increasingly target seniors through sophisticated tactics like fake investment platforms, romance scams and impersonation of government or tech support personnel. These schemes often involve urgent demands, emotional manipulation or unfamiliar technologies like crypto ATMs.To minimize risk, seniors should be educated on the basics of cryptocurrency, recognize common fraud tactics, use reputable platforms and involve trusted family or advisers before making transactions. Awareness and vigilance are essential to protect both assets and peace of mind in the digital age.As crypto continues to go mainstream, scammers are adapting fast. Don’t let your loved ones get rug-pulled or emotionally manipulated into losing everything. Share these tips. Stay involved. And when in doubt, always verify before sending funds.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/elderly-crypto-investors-are-getting-scammed-teach-them-these-key-safety-tips?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-28T13:00:00.000Z,"Former Chainlink, Two Sigma execs build ‘Moirai’ to uncover crypto gems","Metalayer Ventures, a crypto-focused venture capital firm led by former executives from Chainlink and Two Sigma, has launched a $25 million fund to invest in early-stage blockchain projects with a focus on stablecoins, tokenization and cryptocurrency infrastructure. Metalayer’s fund has already backed seven companies, the company disclosed to Cointelegraph on May 28. These include AnchorZero, a platform helping crypto founders use Roth IRAs for tax advantages, and Spark Capital, a new venture focused on stablecoin infrastructure.Other portfolio companies include Ethena, ClearToken, Crossover Markets, Station70 and Theo — an onchain trading infrastructure project that recently raised $20 million from 17 different VC firms.The company plans to eventually back up to 30 companies with early-stage rounds ranging from $500,000 to $1 million.Metalayer was co-founded by Chainlink Labs’ former head of growth, Mickey Graham, and former Two Sigma executives Andy Kangpan and David Winton.Winton developed a proprietary data platform called Moirai to help Metalayer analyze developer activity, protocol engagement and blockchain transaction patterns to uncover promising projects. “Moirai is our internal sourcing engine for identifying early-stage crypto startups,” Graham told Cointelegraph in a written statement. “The platform is designed to help us systematically surface high-quality startups, and it evaluates opportunities across several key dimensions,” he said.Related: VC Roundup: 8-figure funding deals suggest crypto bull market far from overCrypto VC deals on the rise, but there’s a catchCrypto venture capital activity saw a notable uptick in the first quarter, with increases in both total funding and deal volume, according to data from Galaxy Digital. VC funding reached $4.9 billion during the quarter, though nearly half came from a single deal — Binance, which raised $2 billion from MGX, an investment firm backed by a United Arab Emirates sovereign wealth fund.Despite the outsized impact of the Binance deal, overall market activity showed signs of improving. A total of 446 crypto funding deals were recorded in Q1, marking a 7% increase from the previous quarter.Crypto VC deals remain considerably lower than the peak of the previous bull market. Source: GalaxyNevertheless, venture capital investors remain cautious about making fresh commitments to the sector, according to Robert Lee, a senior analyst at PitchBook. The first quarter was a challenging market environment as a sharp correction in crypto prices compounded investor reluctance.In an interview with Bloomberg last month, Lee noted that many venture capital firms are still on the sidelines. “[M]any of the funds from the last cycle have yet to deliver meaningful DPI,” he said, referring to the private equity metric Distributed to Paid-In Capital, which measures how much capital has been returned to investors relative to what they invested.Metalayer’s Mickey Graham believes that at least some of this drop-off is due to a much-needed transition happening beneath the surface:“We believe the crypto industry has crossed the chasm from an early market defined by infrastructure-building to a mainstream technology sector characterized by the deployment of blockchain technology throughout the global economy.”Although VC activity remains subdued compared to past bull cycles, Kadan Stadelmann, the chief technology officer of the Komodo Platform, told Cointelegraph that the industry has seen an “uptick in mergers and acquisitions, suggesting market maturation.”Stadelmann indicated that pro-crypto regulations in the United States and European Union, “have given large institutions confidence to continue making investments into crypto firms.”At a geographic level, the US accounted for more than a third of total crypto VC deals in 2024 — a trend expected to continue this year.

Could this technical setup, coupled with the SEC’s review of a spot XRP ETF application by WisdomTree, signal the start of a rally to $3.40 and higher?XRP falling wedge pattern targets $3.40From a technical perspective, XRP (XRP) price could gain significant momentum if it breaks out of this falling wedge pattern.In technical analysis, a falling wedge is a bullish reversal chart pattern that comprises two converging trend lines that connect lower highs and lower lows. This convergence indicates a weakening downward momentum. XRP price is currently retesting the resistance provided by the upper trendline of the wedge at $2.42. A break above this level will likely trigger a quick rise in price, with the bulls targeting the technical target of the wedge at $3.40, a 48% increase from current prices.XRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe relative strength index (RSI) has climbed to 47 from 31 on April 8, indicating that bullish momentum is building up.However, to sustain the ongoing recovery, XRP’s price has to first hold the support at $2.20 and then overcome the resistance between $2.60 and $2.80.Several analysts are optimistic about a rebound higher, with pseudonymous trader Cryptowzrd saying that a validation of a falling wedge could see XRP break out toward $2.90.“$XRP closed indecisively and is still maintaining a falling wedge formation,” the trader wrote in a May 28 post on X, adding: “A breakout of this wedge will push markets toward the $2.80 resistance.

2025-05-28T09:59:06.000Z,"Fungible cryptos in secondary sales are not securities, Ripple tells SEC","Ripple, the blockchain company behind XRP, argued that fungible cryptocurrencies are not securities when transferred in secondary transactions in a recent letter sent to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).In its May 27 letter, Ripple cited US attorney and crypto law thought leader Lewis Cohen to support its claim. In his widely cited 2022 paper, “The Ineluctable Modality of Securities Law: Why Fungible Crypto Assets Are Not Securities,” he wrote:“[T]here is no current basis in the law relating to ‘investment contracts’ to classify most fungible crypto assets as ‘securities’ when transferred in secondary transactions.”In his paper, Cohen explained that in secondary transactions, an investment contract transaction is generally not present. He further claimed that fungible cryptocurrencies “neither create nor represent the necessary cognizable legal relationship between” a legal entity and the holder that is the “hallmark of a security.”Related: Banking groups ask SEC to drop cybersecurity incident disclosure ruleSEC’s “new paradigm”Ripple also referenced SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce's May 19 “new paradigm” speech. She said she’d been voicing her dissent with the regulator’s approach to crypto, adding:“Having emerged from the crypto dissent years, I am glad to be able speak to you today as the head of the Commission’s Crypto Task Force about a rational and coherent path forward and a new paradigm at the SEC.”Peirce said that the SEC’s “approach to crypto in recent years has evaded sound regulatory practice and must be corrected.” She also said that most cryptocurrencies are not securities, adding:“Most currently existing crypto assets in the market are not [securities]. My supplemental answer is that economic realities matter and non-security crypto assets may be distributed as part of an investment contract, which is a type of security.”Ripple’s long fight with the SECThe SEC had viewed a large portion of digital assets as securities, with the regulator’s former chair, Gary Gensler, stating in 2023 that most of the crypto market falls under the securities bracket. This stance led to a protracted legal battle between the SEC and Ripple.The lawsuit first began at the end of 2020, when the SEC took action against Ripple and its executives, claiming that XRP sales constituted unregistered security offerings. Still, after the government’s stance on crypto changed with the election of current US President Donald Trump, Ripple has mostly won the battle, with the SEC recently dropping its appeal against a ruling favorable to the company.In its recent letter to the SEC, Ripple also cited a ruling in the case noting that “the court held that certain of Ripple’s historical institutional sales of XRP were investment contracts,” while the secondary sales were not. Furthermore, the judge “determined that XRP itself is not a security.”Magazine: XRP win leaves Ripple and industry with no crypto legal precedent set",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ripple-sec-letter-crypto-not-securities?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

It’s going to be really, really hard; you’re not going to have the same push and pull,” she said.The Trump administration has floated the idea of handing the reins of crypto regulation to the CFTC in the past.

Source: DappRadar“For now, the sector seems to be in a holding pattern, waiting either for market recovery or a new use case to reignite interest.”Gherghelas added that other catalysts that could rekindle NFT lending were tools that make it easier for NFT holders to borrow against their tokens, and that protocols should create “smart infrastructure” such as undercollateralized loans, credit scores and artificial intelligence risk matching.The report adds that since January last year, borrower activity has declined by 90% and those willing to lend have shrunk by 78%.The average NFT loan size has also taken a hit from a peak of $22,000 in 2022 to $4,000 in May, a 71% year-over-year drop.Gherghelas said this shift “shows that either users are borrowing against lower-value assets or simply becoming more conservative with leverage.”NFT lending overall trading volume and market activity have dropped off from the all-time highs of past years. Source: DappRadarThe average loan duration is also lower; after hitting an average of roughly 40 days in 2023, it’s been down to 31 days and has held steady throughout 2024 and into 2025.Gherghelas said this could indicate that “loans are being taken more frequently but for shorter periods, perhaps a sign of more tactical liquidity plays.”NFT ﻿market downturn also hurts lendingPart of the slowdown in NFT lending is connected to the overall NFT market decline, which has seen volumes drop 61% in the first quarter to $1.5 billion compared to $4.1 billion a year ago.“With collateral value collapsing, the lending activity naturally followed,” Gherghelas said. “There are a few exceptions that managed to hold or regain traction, but they’ve been outliers, not enough to lift the sector.”Related: AI decentralized apps are coming for the Web3 throne: DappRadarThe protocol landscape has also narrowed, and the number of active NFT lending apps is limited, with only eight protocols holding any meaningful share.“The flip-for-liquidity model that worked during bull markets isn’t built for a quieter, more risk-averse environment.

SharpLink will invest $425 million to acquire 120,000 ETH. Ethereum futures open interest hits an all-time high of $36.1 billion, with ETH price climbing 4.5% on the daily chart. Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming (SBET) announced a $425 million private investment in public equity (PIPE), acquiring approximately 69.1 million shares at $6.15 each to establish the first Nasdaq-listed Ethereum (ETH) treasury company.Spearheaded by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, this move mirrors Strategy’s (MSTR) successful Bitcoin treasury strategy, which has yielded over $8.2 billion in gains in 2025, by leveraging stock and bond sales to acquire BTC.Former Ethereum core developer and contributor Eric Conner highlighted the bullish implications of SharpLink’s move, noting its potential to create a “public ETH proxy for funds that can’t hold tokens directly.” Conner emphasized that the acquisition of 120,000 ETH—likely to be staked—could lead to “supply compression” by removing tokens from circulation. The Ether proponent also pointed to the “new narrative fuel” this provides, positioning ETH as a “digital reserve collateral” and potentially driving its adoption on mainstream balance sheets through an equity wrapper like $SBET.However, crypto analyst VICTOR cautioned against over-enthusiasm, outlining the risk of leveraging gains from an altcoin still down 19% in 2025. In Q1 2025, Cointelegraph reported a sharp decline in Ethereum network fees, dropping to $605,000 from $2.5 million in just two weeks in March, alongside a noticeable decrease in decentralized app (DApp) activity. Although average daily fees on the Ethereum chain have stayed above $1 million since May 9, 2025, fees remain significantly lower compared to Q1 2024, as highlighted in the chart.Ethereum total value locked (TVL) and chain fees.

The majority of these rallies—eight out of ten—resulted in negative returns, while one rally triggered a short squeeze, driving prices higher, and another displayed neutral price action.From a technical perspective, Ether’s price action on the daily chart posted a descending triangle, a bullish breakout pattern, which creates equal highs and higher lows, converging toward an imminent rally. The pattern is bordered by two trendlines, the upper resistance, currently around $2,700 and the ascending support line. A bullish breakout above $2,677 targets the pattern’s measured move, calculated by adding the triangle’s height to the breakout point. This projects a target range of $3,100–$3,200, aligning with prior resistance levels around $3,100 and $3,400.Ethereum 1-day chart.

Speaking at Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas, Sigel said the most viable path forward may involve inserting Bitcoin mining incentives into the congressional budget reconciliation process.According to Sigel, the most effective path to growing a US strategic Bitcoin reserve would be through targeted amendments to congressional budget legislation. These could include tax credits for mining companies that use methane gas and other incentives aimed at encouraging miners to share a portion of their mined BTC with the federal government. He argued that such an approach would allow the reserve to grow organically over time. Sigel also highlighted the limitations of executive actions in achieving this goal:\""The problem with executive action is that it's going to prompt lawsuits. And anything over $100 million is going to get sued by the Elizabeth Warrens of the world. So, I would say start with something maybe in the Exchange Stabilization Fund for $100 million.\""US President Donald Trump established the US Bitcoin Strategic Reserve through a March 7 executive order.

FalconX, a digital asset broker, said it secured a facility worth over $100 million as part of a “broader credit framework,” while Maple Finance reportedly closed the first tranche of an agreement with Cantor.The service allows companies holding Bitcoin to borrow funds and use the cryptocurrency as collateral, providing a way to unlock liquidity without selling their BTC holdings. Cantor announced its Bitcoin financing business with an initial capital of $2 billion in July 2024, targeting institutional investors seeking to leverage their Bitcoin. At the time, the company said Anchorage Digital and Copper would serve as custodians and collateral managers in the venture.Credit markets are a fundamental part of the financial system, allowing capital to flow between borrowers and lenders and supporting economic activity across sectors. Their central role also means they can contribute to financial distress when risks are mismanaged. While mirroring some functions of traditional finance, crypto credit markets have been operating with less regulatory oversight.Digital asset crisis of 2022 This dynamic was evident during the 2022 crisis in the digital asset sector. Celsius Network, once a leading crypto lending platform, collapsed after engaging in risky financial practices and facing allegations of fraud. Similarly, BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2022 following significant exposure to the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.  According to a report from Galaxy, the total crypto lending market, including crypto-backed collateralized debt positions (CDPs) tied to stablecoins, stood at $36.5 billion in the last quarter of 2024, marking a 43% decline from its all-time high of $64.4 billion in 2021. Despite the broader contraction, onchain lending platforms have seen a dramatic rebound, with open borrowed positions surging to $19.1 billion by Q4 2024, a 959% increase over two years.

However, in this context, it also suggests potential liquidity injections from the Fed, given the unfavorable US fiscal outlook, where government spending exceeds revenue capacity.US President Donald Trump has called for lower interest rates, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell remains cautious due to a strong labor market and rising inflation pressures, whether driven by tariffs or easy credit conditions. This tension helps explain why the S&P 500 has struggled to retake its February all-time high of 6,147 and why Bitcoin’s upside has also been limited.Bitcoin’s current market capitalization of $2.2 trillion now exceeds that of Google and Meta, which partially explains the $112,000 resistance level. Still, it would be inaccurate to suggest Bitcoin has decoupled from traditional markets; its 30-day correlation with the S&P 500 has remained above 70% over the past four weeks.

Bitcoin’s bullish momentum aligns with the favorable US financial conditions, as noted by Ecoinometrics. The macroeconomic-focused Bitcoin newsletter highlighted that the National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) shows a rapid shift to ultra-loose territory after a tightening phase in February 2025. The NFCI, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, tracks stress in the financial system by aggregating measures like credit spreads, leverage, and funding conditions. When the index moves into looser territory, it reflects easier access to capital and reduced market stress—conditions that typically encourage risk-taking behavior among investors. For high-beta assets like Bitcoin, such periods often coincide with price rallies as capital flows into speculative markets.US National Financial Conditions Index.

The newsletter noted, “That’s the kind of macro backdrop where Bitcoin thrives. Bitcoin’s rally to new highs didn’t come out of nowhere. It’s tracking the same pattern we saw since 2023: easing conditions → capital rotation → risk-on.”With Bitcoin just 2% away from its all-time high price, data from CoinGlass indicates that the probability of a short-squeeze remains high due to significant sell-side liquidity.

2025-05-27T15:40:00.000Z,"93% of all Bitcoin is already mined. Here’s what that means","How much Bitcoin is left to mine?              Bitcoin’s total supply is hardcoded at 21 million BTC, a fixed upper limit that cannot be altered without a consensus-breaking change to the protocol. This finite cap is enforced at the protocol level and is central to Bitcoin’s value proposition as a deflationary asset.As of May 2025, approximately 19.6 million Bitcoin (BTC) have been mined, or about 93.3% of the total supply. That leaves roughly 1.4 million BTC yet to be created, and those remaining coins will be mined very slowly.The reason for this uneven distribution is Bitcoin’s exponential issuance schedule, governed by an event called the halving. When Bitcoin launched in 2009, the block reward was 50 BTC. Every 210,000 blocks — or approximately every four years — that reward is cut in half. Because the early rewards were so large, over 87% of the total supply was mined by the end of 2020. Each subsequent halving sharply reduces the rate of new issuance, meaning it will take over a century to mine the remaining 6.7%.According to current estimates, 99% of all Bitcoin will have been mined by 2035, but the final fraction — the last satoshis — won’t be produced until around the year 2140 due to the nature of geometric reward reduction.This engineered scarcity, combined with an immutable supply cap, is what draws comparisons between Bitcoin and physical commodities like gold. But Bitcoin is even more predictable: Gold’s supply grows at around 1.7% annually, whereas Bitcoin’s issuance rate is transparently declining.Did you know? Bitcoin’s supply curve is not terminal in the traditional sense. It follows an asymptotic trajectory — a kind of economic Zeno’s paradox — where rewards diminish indefinitely but never truly reach zero. Mining will continue until around 2140, by which point over 99.999% of the total 21 million BTC will have been issued.                  Beyond the supply cap: How lost coins make Bitcoin scarcer than you think              While over 93% of Bitcoin’s total supply has been mined, that doesn’t mean it’s all available. A significant portion is permanently out of circulation, lost due to forgotten passwords, misplaced wallets, destroyed hard drives or early adopters who never touched their coins again.Estimates from firms like Chainalysis and Glassnode suggest that between 3.0 million and 3.8 million BTC — roughly 14%-18% of the total supply — is likely gone for good. That includes high-profile dormant addresses like the one believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, which alone holds over 1.1 million BTC.This means Bitcoin’s true circulating supply may be closer to 16 million-17 million, not 21 million. And because Bitcoin is non-recoverable by design, any lost coins stay lost — permanently reducing supply over time.Now compare that to gold. Around 85% of the world’s total gold supply has been mined — approximately 216,265 metric tons, according to the World Gold Council — but nearly all of it remains in circulation or held in vaults, jewelry, ETFs and central banks. Gold can be remelted and reused; Bitcoin cannot be resurrected once access is lost.This distinction gives Bitcoin a kind of hardening scarcity, a supply that not only stops growing over time but quietly shrinks.As Bitcoin matures, it’s entering a monetary phase similar to gold: low issuance, high holder concentration and increasing demand-side sensitivity. But Bitcoin takes it further; its supply cap is hard, its loss rate is permanent, and its distribution is publicly auditable.This may lead to several outcomes:Increased price volatility as available supply becomes more limited and sensitive to market demandHigher long-term value concentration in the hands of those who remain active and secure in their key managementA premium on liquidity, where actually spendable BTC trades at a higher effective value than dormant supply.In extreme cases, this could produce a bifurcation between “circulating BTC” and “unreachable BTC,” with the former gaining greater economic significance, particularly in times of constrained exchange liquidity or macroeconomic stress.                  What happens when Bitcoin is fully mined?              There’s a popular assumption that as Bitcoin’s block rewards shrink, the network’s security will eventually suffer. But in practice, the mining economy is far more adaptive — and much more resilient — than that.Bitcoin’s mining incentives are governed by a self-correcting feedback loop: If mining becomes unprofitable, miners drop off the network, which in turn triggers a difficulty adjustment. Every 2,016 blocks (roughly every two weeks), the network recalibrates mining difficulty using a parameter known as nBits. The goal is to keep block times steady at around 10 minutes, regardless of how many miners are competing.So, if Bitcoin’s price drops, or the reward becomes too small relative to operating costs, inefficient miners simply exit. This causes difficulty to fall, lowering the cost for those who remain. The result is a system that continually rebalances itself, aligning network participation with available incentives.This mechanism has already been tested at scale. After China banned mining in mid-2021, Bitcoin’s global hashrate dropped by more than 50% in a matter of weeks. Yet the network continued to function without interruption, and within a few months, the hashrate fully recovered, as miners resumed operations in jurisdictions with lower energy costs and more favorable regulations.Critically, the idea that lower rewards will inherently threaten network security overlooks how mining is tied to profit margins, not nominal BTC amounts. As long as the market price supports the cost of hash power — even at 0.78125 BTC per block (post-2028 halving) or lower — miners will continue to secure the network.In other words, it’s not the absolute reward that matters, but whether mining remains profitable relative to costs. And thanks to Bitcoin’s built-in difficulty adjustment, it usually does.Even a century from now, when the block reward approaches zero, the network will likely still be protected by whatever combination of fees, base incentives and infrastructure efficiency exists at that time. But that’s a distant concern. In the meantime, the current system — hashrate adjusts, difficulty rebalances, miners adapt — remains one of the most robust elements of Bitcoin’s design.Did you know? On April 20, 2024, following the launch of the Runes protocol, Bitcoin miners earned over $80 million in transaction fees within a single day, surpassing the $26 million earned from block rewards. This marked the first time in Bitcoin’s history that transaction fees alone exceeded the block subsidy in daily miner revenue.                  The future of Bitcoin mining: Energy consumption              It’s a common misconception that rising Bitcoin prices will drive endless energy use. In reality, mining is constrained by profitability, not price alone.As block rewards shrink, miners are pushed toward thinner margins, and that means chasing the cheapest, cleanest energy available. Since China’s 2021 mining ban, hashrate has migrated to regions like North America and Northern Europe, where operators tap into surplus hydro, wind and underutilized grid energy.According to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, between 52% and 59% of Bitcoin mining now runs on renewables or low-emission sources. Regulations are reinforcing this trend, with several jurisdictions offering incentives for clean-powered mining or penalizing fossil-fuel operations.Moreover, the idea that higher BTC prices will always mean higher energy use misses how Bitcoin self-regulates: More miners raise difficulty, which compresses margins, capping energy expansion. Renewable-based mining brings its own challenges, but the dystopian future of endlessly expanding fossil-fueled hash power is increasingly unlikely.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/93-of-all-bitcoin-is-already-mined-heres-what-that-means?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-27T15:00:00.000Z,"ZKPs can prove I&#039;m old enough without telling you my age","Opinion by: Andre Omietanski, General Counsel, and Amal Ibraymi, Legal Counsel at Aztec LabsWhat if you could prove you're over 18, without revealing your birthday, name, or anything else at all? Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) make this hypothetical a reality and solve one of the key challenges online: verifying age without sacrificing privacy. The need for better age verification todayWe're witnessing an uptick in laws being proposed restricting minors' access to social media and the internet, including in Australia, Florida, and China. To protect minors from inappropriate adult content, platform owners and governments often walk a tightrope between inaction and overreach. For example, the state of Louisiana in the US recently enacted a law meant to block minors from viewing porn. Sites required users to upload an ID before viewing content. The Free Speech Coalition challenged the law as unconstitutional, making the case that it infringed on First Amendment rights. The lawsuit was eventually dismissed on procedural grounds. The reaction, however, highlights the dilemma facing policymakers and platforms: how to block minors without violating adults' rights or creating new privacy risks.Traditional age verification failsCurrent age verification tools are either ineffective or invasive. Self-declaration is meaningless, since users can simply lie about their age. ID-based verification is overly invasive. No one should be required to upload their most sensitive documents, putting themselves at risk of data breaches and identity theft. Biometric solutions like fingerprints and face scans are convenient for users but raise important ethical, privacy, and security concerns. Biometric systems are not always accurate and may generate false positives and negatives. The irreversible nature of the data, which can't be changed like a regular password can, is also less than ideal. Other methods, like behavioral tracking and AI-driven verification of browser patterns, are also problematic, using machine learning to analyze user interactions and identify patterns and anomalies, raising concerns of a surveillance culture.ZKPs as the privacy-preserving solutionZero-knowledge proofs present a compelling solution. Like a government ID provider, a trusted entity verifies the user's age and generates a cryptographic proof confirming they are over the required age. Websites only need to check the proof, not the excess personal data, ensuring privacy while keeping minors at the gates. No centralized data storage is required, alleviating the burden on platforms such as Google, Meta, and WhatsApp and eliminating the risk of data breaches. Recent: How zero-knowledge proofs can make AI fairerAdopting and enforcing ZKPs at scaleZKPs aren't a silver bullet. They can be complex to implement. The notion of \""don't trust, verify,\"" proven by indisputable mathematics, may cause some regulatory skepticism. Policymakers may hesitate to trust cryptographic proofs over visible ID verification. There are occasions when companies may need to disclose personal information to authorities, such as during an investigation into financial crimes or government inquiries. This would challenge ZKPs, whose very intention is for platforms not to hold this data in the first place.ZKPs also struggle with scalability and performance, being somewhat computationally intensive and tricky to program. Efficient implementation techniques are being explored, and breakthroughs, such as the Noir programming language, are making ZKPs more accessible to developers, driving the adoption of secure, privacy-first solutions. A safer, smarter future for age verificationGoogle's move to adopt ZKPs for age verification is a promising signal that mainstream platforms are beginning to embrace privacy-preserving technologies. But to fully realize the potential of ZKPs, we need more than isolated solutions locked into proprietary ecosystems. Crypto-native wallets can go further. Open-source and permissionless blockchain-based systems offer interoperability, composability, and programmable identity. With a single proof, users can access a range of services across the open web — no need to start from scratch every time, or trust a single provider (Google) with their credentials.ZKPs flip the script on online identity — proving what matters, without exposing anything else. They protect user privacy, help platforms stay compliant, and block minors from restricted content, all without creating new honeypots of sensitive data.Google's adoption of ZKPs shows mainstream momentum is building. But to truly transform digital identity, we must embrace crypto-native, decentralized systems that give users control over what they share and who they are online.In an era defined by surveillance, ZKPs offer a better path forward — one that's secure, private, and built for the future.Opinion by: Andre Omietanski, General Counsel, and Amal Ibraymi, Legal Counsel at Aztec Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-27T14:30:00.000Z,"What is a cryptocurrency mixer and how does it work?","Cryptocurrency mixers explained              A cryptocurrency mixer is a specialized service designed to increase the privacy and anonymity of blockchain transactions. Unlike traditional financial transactions, which are private by default, most cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) operate on public blockchains. This means every transaction is permanently recorded and accessible to anyone, making it possible for blockchain analysts or malicious actors to trace the flow of funds between wallets.A crypto mixer’s primary function is to break the link between the sender’s wallet and the recipient’s wallet. It does so by pooling together coins from many users and then redistributing them in a way that makes it difficult to track which coins went where. Think of it like a digital version of shuffling cards in a deck. After mixing, your cryptocurrency is returned to you or a recipient’s address, but it’s “cleaned” of any direct transaction history.This privacy-enhancing feature is why some people rely on mixers, especially those seeking to keep their financial activities confidential in an open-ledger world.                  How does a crypto mixer work?              To understand a crypto mixer, it’s useful to compare it to the concept of money laundering in traditional finance, albeit with legal and ethical nuances. The process of “mixing” is essentially designed to obscure the origin and destination of coins.Here’s a typical workflow of how a cryptocurrency mixer operates:Deposit: You send your cryptocurrency to the mixer’s wallet address. Multiple users do the same, creating a large pool of coins.Mixing/shuffling: The mixer’s system pools and shuffles these coins together, breaking any visible connection between deposited and withdrawn funds.Redistribution: After mixing, the service sends back an equivalent amount of coins to your specified address, but these aren’t the same coins you deposited. They come from the pooled coins of all participants.Fees: The mixer usually deducts a small fee, generally ranging from 1% to 3%, to cover operational costs.This process effectively disrupts blockchain analysis, making it extremely difficult for anyone to trace the coins back to their original owners.                  Types of cryptocurrency mixers              Not all mixers are created equal. They can broadly be divided into two categories: centralized and decentralized mixers.Centralized mixersCentralized mixers are the most common and operate similarly to traditional services. You send your coins to a company or entity that controls the mixing process, and then they send back “clean” coins after mixing. These services are relatively easy to use, often providing a simple user interface.However, centralized mixers require you to trust the service operator with your coins, at least temporarily. This introduces risks such as:The mixer could be a scam and disappear with your funds.It could be hacked, exposing users’ data and coins.The operator may keep logs that could compromise your privacy.Decentralized mixersDecentralized mixers use blockchain technology and smart contracts to automate the mixing process without a trusted third party. They rely on cryptographic methods such as zero-knowledge proofs to mix coins in a trustless environment. Users pool their coins into a smart contract, which then redistributes coins in a way that ensures privacy.Advantages of decentralized mixers include:No central point of failure or custody risk.Higher privacy because no single party controls the funds.Often more resistant to regulatory crackdowns.Did you know? The DOJ indicted four Russians for operating crypto mixers Blender.io and Sinbad.io, yet failed to show they knowingly laundered illicit funds. The indictment relies heavily on vague forum posts and lacks concrete evidence of criminal intent or ties to US commerce, raising serious doubts about its strength in court.                  Real-world cases involving mixers and scams              Unfortunately, the privacy offered by crypto mixers has also attracted criminals. The very anonymity that protects innocent users can also shield illicit activities, leading to widespread misuse.Crypto mixers have been linked to ransomware attacks, dark web marketplaces, fraud and drug trafficking. Criminals often use these services to “clean” proceeds from illegal transactions and hide their tracks from law enforcement.A notable example is ChipMixer, a service seized by Europol in 2023 for allegedly facilitating money laundering for dark web markets and ransomware groups. Authorities dismantled the platform’s infrastructure over alleged money laundering, seizing four servers, 1,909.4 BTC (about $210 million as of May 26, 2025) and seven TB of data across 55 transactions.Mixers have also been involved in laundering stolen funds from cryptocurrency exchange hacks. The complexity of these transactions makes it difficult for investigators to recover stolen assets.In February 2025, Bybit, a major cryptocurrency exchange, suffered a significant security breach resulting in the theft of about $1.5 billion worth of cryptocurrencies. The attackers, attributed to the Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking organization, employed various crypto mixers, including Wasabi, CryptoMixer, Railgun and Tornado Cash, to launder portions of the stolen assets. Despite efforts to trace the funds, a significant portion remains unaccounted for, highlighting the challenges posed by mixers in cybersecurity investigations.                  Are crypto mixers legal?              The legal status of cryptocurrency mixers depends largely on the jurisdiction and context of their use.Most governments impose strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing regulations on financial services, including digital currency services. Mixers, by their nature, complicate AML compliance because they obscure transaction trails.For instance,In the European Union, the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD) includes digital currency providers under its regulatory scope, requiring them to perform KYC checks and report suspicious activity.In the United States, FinCEN classifies cryptocurrency mixers as money transmitters, requiring registration and compliance with AML regulations. Unlicensed mixers can face severe penalties and criminal charges.Legal uses vs misuseUsing a mixer for privacy reasons is not inherently illegal. However, if mixers are used to launder proceeds from crimes, authorities will prosecute offenders. Similarly, operating a mixer without appropriate licenses or regulatory oversight can be illegal.If you choose to use a mixer, make sure you understand the legal implications in your country and avoid any activity that could be linked to money laundering or fraud.Did you know? Crypto mixer transactions are still taxable. Using a mixer doesn’t hide gains from tax authorities; failing to report them can trigger audits or penalties. Always keep records and understand your local tax obligations.                  How to stay safe and avoid scam-linked mixers              If you decide to use a cryptocurrency mixer, your safety and security should be paramount. Here are some essential tips to avoid scams and legal troubles:Choose reputable mixers: Conduct thorough research. Look for mixers with good reviews, transparent operations and clear compliance policies.Avoid unknown or suspicious services: Steer clear of mixers linked to scams, hacks or regulatory actions.Check for licensing and compliance: Prefer mixers that comply with AML/KYC regulations, especially if you are a business or high-value user.Understand fees and timelines: Be clear on the fees involved and the expected time for your funds to be returned after mixing.Use hardware wallets and strong security practices: Always safeguard your private keys and use hardware wallets to minimize risks.Stay updated on regulations: Laws surrounding crypto mixers evolve rapidly.

2025-05-27T12:00:15.000Z,"StarkWare launches mobile-friendly zero-knowledge prover","Blockchain company StarkWare has unveiled zero-knowledge (ZK) prover STARK Two (S-two), enabling enhanced privacy and verification on everyday devices like phones, laptops and browsers. The company said the new ZK prover allows users to generate complex cryptographic proofs from the client side. This means users can generate ZK-proofs directly on their devices instead of relying on a server or cloud infrastructure, opening the door for faster and more private applications across the internet. “S-two will bring STARK proving to everyday devices, and open the door for new real-world proving use cases,” said Eli Ben-Sasson, StarkWare co-founder and CEO, adding that the tool could empower the next wave of ZK applications. The company said the ZK prover is now available in public alpha and is set to roll out on Starknet, its Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, later this year.  StarkWare says new ZK prover is 39 times faster than old solutions StarkWare said that benchmark tests for the S-two ZK prover showed that it was 39 times faster than previous solutions. The performance leap enables smoother experiences in privacy-enhancing applications. The upgrade also allows use cases in private transactions, ZK-based identity and verifiable artificial intelligence. StarkWare said S-two runs on CPUs, GPUs and will soon be on browsers. “For years we’ve called the prover our magic wand, a tool that transforms complex computation into a simple proof,” Ben-Sasson said. “Now, the wand has become a lightsaber in your pocket, something anyone can wield, instantly, from your own device.”According to StarkWare, developers can build with S-two, adding that its alpha release supports hardware targets. Furthermore, the company said ZK ecosystem participants like Kakarot, Nexus, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs have already adopted the technology. Kakarot uses S-two inside ETHProofs to generate Ethereum block proofs more efficiently, while Nexus is standardizing RISC-V traces to align with S-two’s architecture. Meanwhile, ZAN and AntChain OpenLabs are adding GPU acceleration to push the prover’s performance even further.Use cases for S-two zero-knowledge proverStarkWare chief operating officer Oren Katz told Cointelegraph that S-two marks a shift in how ZK-proofs are used in daily lives. Generating validity proofs directly in devices will allow privacy-preserving features in messaging, payments and digital identity. “You can prove a payment was valid without showing your balance, or verify identity without revealing personal details,” Katz added. Katz said that even salary payments could be made onchain with full transparency and no exposure of sensitive information. He dubbed the development a “big step toward bringing zero-knowledge tech into the mainstream.”Beyond privacy, Katz said, local proof generation also unlocks use cases in other industries. The executive told Cointelegraph that it can allow gamers to play offline and later generate cryptographic proof of their achievements. “An operator, instead of running all logic onchain to prove integrity, can run it on their own servers and simply generate a proof that it was executed correctly,” Katz added.Related: Ethereum co-founder responds to Sweden’s cashless-society rethinkNew ZK prover follows Ethereum’s privacy pushThe launch of StarWare’s upgraded ZK prover follows Ethereum’s push for better privacy. On April 11, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin published a roadmap that addressed privacy enhancements for wallets, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and infrastructure. Buterin advocated implementing privacy-enhancing norms and features across the Ethereum ecosystem, including adding privacy tools in ETH wallets. Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/starkware-unveils-s-two-client-side-zk-prover?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
