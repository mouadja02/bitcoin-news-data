2025-06-21T17:36:52,"Ordinals price prediction 2025 – 2031: Can ORDI surge 100X?","Key Takeaways: Our Ordinals price prediction anticipates a high of $29.81 in 2025. In 2027, it will range between $50.88 and $59.50, with an average price of $52.31. In 2030, it will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. In December 2023, ORDI became the first BRC-20 token to breach $1 billion in market capitalization. Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation. The Ordinals protocol allows data to be embedded directly on Bitcoin’s smallest unit—the Satoshi. ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins. Currently trading at the $48 mark, investors can’t help but speculate on Ordi’s price trajectory. How high will ORDI go? Can ORDI surge 100x? What will the price of ORDI be in 2030? Let’s explore the ORDI price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ordinals Symbol ORDI Current price $6.99 Market cap $146.85M 24-hour trading volume $40.89M Circulating supply 21M All-time high $96.17 on Mar 5, 2024 All-time low $2.86 on Sep 11, 2023 24-hour high $7.41 24-hour low $6.93 ORDI price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility (30-day variation) 12.70% 50-day SMA $9.29 200-day SMA $16.99 Sentiment Bearish Green days 14/30 (47%) ORDI price analysis On the day of writing (June 21), ORDI’s price dropped by 4.48% in 24 hours and 33.30% in the last thirty days. Its trading volume rose by 54.04% in 24 hours, as more traders positioned themselves in the bear market. ORDI/USD 1-day chart ORDI/USD 1-day price chart. Source TradingView The Ordinal daily chart shows that ORDI trades below the William alligator trendlines, signaling a bearish market sentiment. The move comes as Bitcoin pulls back from $104,000. The signal and MACD lines of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator are below zero, with the histograms in negative territory signaling a bearish market. At the same time, the relative strength index shows that the price is in neutral territory at 35.46. It is oversold when it drops below 30. ORDI/USD 4-hour chart ORDI/USD 4-hour chart.

ORDI is bearish at current levels, with the fear and greed index showing greed among investors. On the charts, it is falling further as it corrects from the month’s high. Recent news: Ordinals can now bridge to Cardano Cardano has continued to advance as a venue for Bitcoin Defi, facilitating a transfer of Ordinals to its mainnet. The transaction between Bitcoin and Cardano was facilitated by BitVMX, an interoperability protocol built using the BitVM programming language and unveiled at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Why is ORDI down? ORDI is in a bear run this year. The drop in the ORDI value could be attributed to the market’s correction from the bull run in the last quarter of 2024. Will ORDI recover? ORDI is trading at its lowest this year and is ripe for a reversal. It should recover in the coming months. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will get to $1,000 before 2030. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030? According to the 2030 Ordinals price prediction, they will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. What is the Sats ordinal price prediction for 2050? When we extrapolate Ordi’s price predictions, we find that it is likely to reach a high of $421 in 2050. Does ORDI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ORDI will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is ORDI a good investment? ORDI had the first-mover advantage on the Ordinals protocol. ORDI, like Bitcoin, has a capped supply of 21 million coins and should, therefore, become scarce over time. Our Cryptopolitan Price Prediction shows how the coin will gain value in the years to come.

Source: CoinStats According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $8 in May.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ordinals-price-prediction/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|ORDI","Crypto Price Predictions|ORDI",cryptocompare

2025-06-21T17:30:44,"XRP Is Quietly Coiling Like a Spring, Expert Says Coming Breakout Will be Fast","While Bitcoin dominates headlines and market sentiment, crypto expert Ripple Van Winkle has drawn attention to a less obvious but potentially explosive setup: XRP is coiling like a spring, and when it finally releases, the move could be swift, sharp, and unforgiving to those on the sidelines. According to Van Winkle’s recent post on X, XRP’s chart is forming a classic symmetrical triangle—a pattern typically associated with periods of tightening price consolidation before a decisive breakout. He writes, “Everyone’s staring at BTC like it’s the only show in town… Meanwhile, XRP is quietly coiling like a spring on the macro.” His message is clear: most eyes are missing the buildup, but when XRP erupts, it won’t be gradual. “It’ll be violent,” he warns. “And the sidelines? They’ll be begging for entries that never come back.” Everyone’s staring at $BTC like it’s the only show in town… Meanwhile, $XRP is quietly coiling like a spring on the macro. When this thing erupts, it won’t be slow. It’ll be violent. And the sidelines? They’ll be begging for entries that never come back. Chart’s not lying —… — Ripple Van Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) June 20, 2025 The Technical Picture XRP has been trading in a narrowing range, with higher lows and lower highs compressing price action into a tightening wedge . This technical pattern typically signals an imminent breakout. Traders often watch for a strong volume surge and a break above resistance as confirmation of the move. Currently, XRP hovers around $2.12, with a daily range between $2.09 and $2.14. Market analysts suggest that if XRP can push above the $2.35–$2.40 resistance zone, the move could extend quickly to $2.60, then potentially to $3.00. Van Winkle, based on macro chart projections, sees a much larger breakout target of around $5.30 if the full height of the triangle pattern plays out to completion. Quiet Accumulation Signals Institutional Confidence While public attention remains fixed on Bitcoin and Ethereum, blockchain data reveals increasing XRP accumulation among large holders. T hese “whales” have been steadily adding to their positions during the current consolidation , signaling a high-conviction bet on future price appreciation. This behavior supports the idea that insiders are preparing for a significant move, rather than exiting positions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Adding to the momentum is growing optimism around possible XRP-related ETF products. While nothing has been confirmed, speculation that XRP could be included in future exchange-traded offerings has helped to renew investor interest. Any official announcement or regulatory green light on this front would likely act as a major catalyst, driving volume and demand. Chart Timing and Market Psychology Van Winkle’s post touches on something that goes beyond technical patterns—timing and market psychology. Markets tend to reward those who position early. By the time price breaks out and headlines catch up, the best entries are often gone. That’s why he cautions that “time is” the truth-teller in this setup, not just the chart itself. The coiling motion visible on the XRP chart reflects both consolidation and indecision. But as the pattern nears its apex, that indecision is likely to resolve in one direction. And given the context—rising accumulation, broader crypto optimism, and potential ETF tailwinds—the probability leans bullish. Final Thoughts XRP may not be the flashiest token in the market right now, but as Ripple Van Winkle emphasizes, that’s exactly what makes it so dangerous to ignore. Beneath the surface, the technicals are aligning, smart money is accumulating, and a breakout setup is taking shape. If the coiled spring does snap, it won’t be slow or forgiving—and those waiting too long might miss the chance to act. In a market where timing is everything, XRP’s moment may be closer than most realize. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-06-21T17:10:04,"Rumours about Ripple teaming up with SWIFT surge","Ripple’s legal counsel has denied growing speculation that the U.S. government is planning to seize XRP tokens currently held in escrow by the blockchain firm. The denial comes amid a flurry of social media posts suggesting Ripple’s XRP holdings could be used to back a future government-backed digital reserve. Bill Morgan, a prominent lawyer closely associated with the blockchain company, dismissed the claims outright in a post on X (formerly Twitter), stating simply, “No, it won’t,” in response to a widely circulated tweet alleging imminent U.S. government seizure of Ripple’s XRP escrow. Morgan stopped the speculation that social media activist John Squire raised concerns about the U.S. government’s approach to crypto reserves. By addressing the rumors head-on, Morgan has helped temper the narrative that Ripple’s escrow could be subject to federal intervention—a notion widely dismissed by legal and blockchain experts. High-profile X voices, like Pumpius, have also been linked to rumours and reports about the U.S. government’s move on XRP. He stated that while the rumors of XRP escrow were hard to believe, it could possibly be true. Pumpius compared Bitcoin ETFs to the situation. According to him, BTC ETFs seemed impossible initially, but eventually came true, saying that crypto can pull off surprise feats. According to credible sources, these rumors have been ignited by the announcement that the blockchain company has released 1 billion XRP from its escrow. The tokens were sent in three separate transactions: 500 million, 300 million, and 200 million XRP, worth over $2.2 billion. Interestingly, this is not the first rumor concerning the company and the U.S. government. Following reports in March, there were rumors that Ripple was offering the U.S. government 45% of its XRP to get access. According to the speculations, Ripple was discussing a strategic settlement—potentially through an arrangement of the use of XRP, rather than a cash payment—to close out its legal dispute with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Rumours about Ripple teaming up with SWIFT surge Another rumor was about Ripple’s XRP Ledger being integrated into the massive global interbank system SWIFT. However, many of the claims about SWIFT’s interest were grossly exaggerated. Ripple had successfully teamed up with several big banks for cross-border payments, but the rumors about SWIFT were mostly just speculation and not based on real facts. Still, if it worked out, the partnership would be a significant achievement for blockchain and TradFi integration. Additionally, when the SEC indicated that it would dismiss its lengthy lawsuit against Ripple, the company pushed to incorporate its unique blockchain technology into traditional financial institutions. Most notably, Ripple bought global prime brokerage platform Hidden Road for $1.25 billion. It also released its own stablecoin, RLUSD. With this further foray into TradFi, the SWIFT partnership rumors surged once again. Squire pointed out that several prominent figures have hinted at an impending announcement from SWIFT. According to him, this announcement could potentially confirm the integration of XRP, via Ripple, into SWIFT’s global payment network , used by over 11,000 financial institutions worldwide. These are among the rumours about XRP. As speculation concerning XRP grows, many of these claims have been met with skepticism from many in the crypto space. Therefore, analysts have called for proof to address these claims and prevent further rumors concerning XRP in the future.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency climbed above $105,000 for the second time this week. At press time, it was trading at nearly $104,000, up 0.50% over the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears Climax, But A Twist Awaits—Analyst Reveals Key Insight Historical RSI Breakouts Could Signal New Push According to the charts shared by Moustache, Bitcoin’s monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI) tends to surge into overbought territory just before major rallies. Back in July 2013, Bitcoin sat at $66, then jumped to nearly $1,120 by November as the RSI hit high levels. A similar spike happened in May 2017, when BTC rose from about $1,300 to $19,700 by December. On April 1, 2021, Bitcoin reached $64,800 while the RSI again climbed beyond its usual range. In 2024, those RSI peaks came on March 1 at $73,800 and again in November when it cleared $100,000. #Bitcoin$BTC monthly RSI is so close to entering overbought territory.

In past runs, Bitcoin often paused or pulled back for days or even weeks before the real rally got underway. Sometimes the RSI stayed elevated while prices drifted sideways. In 2017, for example, a correction followed the high RSI but the broader uptrend kept going. Today’s RSI is near those same levels—and could linger there for a while.

That's the message from an options-based strategy called 25-delta risk reversal, which involves the simultaneous purchase of a put option and sale of a call, or vice versa. At the time of writing, risk reversals based on Deribit -listed bitcoin and ether options indicated that investors were positioning for downside volatility over the summer. BTC's 25-delta risk reversals for June, July, and August tenors were negative, indicating a preference for put options, which offer downside protection, over calls or bullish bets, according to data source Amberdata . In ETH's case, puts were pricier out to the July end expiry. Traders typically buy put options to hedge their long positions in the spot and futures markets, protecting themselves from potential price declines. ""Risk reversals in both BTC and ETH continue to show a preference for downside protection across June and September tenors. This suggests that long holders are actively hedging spot exposure and preparing for potential drawdowns,"" Singapore-based QCP Capital said in a market note. The nervousness is evident from the over-the-counter liquidity platform Paradigm, where the top five BTC trades for the week include a put spread and a bearish risk reversal. Meanwhile, in ETH's case, a long position in the $2,450 put crossed the tape alongside a short strangle (volatility) trade. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has spent over 40 days trading back and forth above $100,000, according to CoinDesk data. According to analysts , profit-taking by long-term holders and miner selling have counteracted the strong uptake for spot ETFs, leaving prices directionless. ""Bitcoin has recently tracked sideways, suggesting its current price may be too high for many retail investors. Open interest in BTC options has risen, with a positive and rising 25 delta put-call skew on 30-day contracts, which may imply that market participants are seeking short-term protection through put options,"" Coinbase Institutional's weekly report noted. On Friday, BTC closed (UTC) below the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) to trade below the key support for the first time since mid-April. The breakdown may lead to more chart-driven selling, potentially resulting in a drop below $100,000. Some observers, however, expect a rally to new record highs. According to market observer Cas Abbé , BTC's on-balance volume continues to indicate strong buying pressure, suggesting that prices could rise to $130,000-$135,000 by the end of the third quarter.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/21/what-are-savvy-bitcoin-and-ether-traders-preparing-for-as-summer-approaches,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|Options|Deribit|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-21T16:55:54,"Federal Reserve Governor Says Interest Rate Cuts Could Materialize As Early as July","Rate cuts could materialize earlier than consensus expectations, according to Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller. In a new interview with CNBC, Waller says the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) could slash the federal funds rate as soon as July. “Any tariff inflation we should see, and I’ve been given various estimates, and I don’t think it’s going to be that big, and we should just look through it in terms of setting policy and look at the underlying trend of inflation. And right now, the data the last few months is showing that trend inflation is looking pretty good, even on a 12-month basis, so I’ve labeled these ‘good news rate cuts,’ if inflation comes down to target, we can actually bring rates down. I’ve been saying this since around November of ’23. So I think we’re in that position that we could do this as early as July.” Waller does say that’s just his view and acknowledges the FOMC might not share that opinion. The FOMC announced on Wednesday that it planned to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4.25-4.5%, arguing that it was the most suitable level to achieve both maximum employment and controlled inflation. The Fed has held interest rates steady since December, when it cut the rate by 0.25%. CME Fed Watch tool indicates there’s only a 14.5% chance of a rate cut in July but a 61.8% chance of one at the FOMC’s meeting in September.

He says he followed the thieves’ instructions after seeing text messages and banking details that appeared to support their claims. “I couldn’t even believe how sophisticated it was.” Leahy, who had been saving up for years in hopes of starting a family with his wife, says the fraudsters drained his entire life savings, $32,000, from his account. “I had literally never felt like the wind had been taken out of my sails before. I’d never really felt like I was going to pass out before, but it really felt like the end of the world for me.” When JPMorgan Chase learned of the incident, the bank decided to send Leahy $2,000 – just 6.25% of the money that he lost. According to the banking giant, Leahy’s case does not qualify for fraud protection, leaving him to shoulder most of the losses. In a statement to WFAA, JPMorgan Chase draws a distinction between scams and fraud. “Fraud on a bank account involves someone illegally accessing someone else’s account and making withdrawals, transfers, or purchases without the account holder’s permission. [A scam] is a deceptive scheme or trick used to cheat someone out of their money or other valuable assets. Scammers often use false promises, misleading information, or deceptive activities to manipulate victims into giving up something of value. Scams can take many forms, including counterfeit or non-existent products sold on social media marketplaces, phishing emails, fake websites, spoofed Caller IDs on mobile phones, fake profiles on dating sites, fake jobs on job boards, among others.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-21T16:32:43,"Making Wealth Fairer: TUIMAX Breaks Financial Barriers with Blockchain","The traditional financial system has evolved for over a century, yet fair access to financial services remains an unfulfilled promise. According to the World Bank, more than 1.7 billion adults around the world still lack access to a bank account, and hundreds of millions more are excluded from even the most basic financial tools. In response, TUIMAX is leveraging blockchain and crypto assets to build a more inclusive global financial system. TUIMAX is a crypto asset platform driven by a vision of “inclusive finance.” Headquartered in Singapore and licensed by FinCEN with a U.S. MSB registration, TUIMAX has remained committed to the principle of “technology for good” since its inception. The platform aims to use blockchain technology to connect marginalized communities and dismantle the geographic and systemic barriers imposed by traditional finance. TUIMAX’s mission is carried out through three main initiatives: 1. Creating Accessible Financial Accounts Unlike traditional banks that require cumbersome paperwork and charge high fees, TUIMAX allows users to register in just 10 seconds and begin managing assets within 5 minutes. The platform provides a free basic digital wallet supporting stablecoins and major assets like USDT, BTC, and ETH, making it easy even for first-time crypto users to get started. 2. Delivering Tailored Education for Emerging Markets TUIMAX has launched multilingual crypto literacy programs in collaboration with local universities and nonprofits in countries such as the Philippines, Nigeria, and India. These include in-person courses and an online learning platform focused on introductory crypto finance. Every user also receives a simplified “Beginner’s Investment Guide” and access to one-on-one customer support. 3. Empowering Users Through Community Governance TUIMAX has implemented an “On-Chain Community Points System” that rewards users for participating in project voting, submitting suggestions, referring others, or completing learning tasks. Points can be redeemed for tokens, fee discounts, or early access to project testing. This mechanism encourages users to evolve from passive participants into active contributors and co-builders of the ecosystem. “We’re not just here to offer trading tools,” said the TUIMAX co-founder, “we’re here to build a truly decentralized financial ecosystem that’s based on trust, accessibility, and usability.” Looking ahead, TUIMAX plans to further strengthen its local presence in underbanked regions and roll out new modules such as an “On-Chain Identity System” and “Mobile Banking Solutions,” giving more people the right to financial freedom in the digital age.

2025-06-21T16:25:42,"ZachXBT Accuses Garden Finance For Laundering  Bybit Hack Funds","The post ZachXBT Accuses Garden Finance For Laundering Bybit Hack Funds appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Recent data from the Dune Analytics reveals that Garden Finance has experienced a remarkable growth in its platform which is witnessed by charts of BTC swaps, user interactions, and total fees collected during Q2 of 2025 compared to Q1. Notably, as the platform displayed the Garden Finance has facilitated a total BTC volume of 24,984 BTC, translating to over $1.5 billion across 40,571 atomic swaps. Also, it has accumulated 40.11 BTC in fees, with the largest single swap on its platform reaching 10 BTC. The data has positioned them as “the fastest Bitcoin bridge,” Garden Finance’s impressive growth in the first half of 2025 is clearly illustrated in the Dune Analytics charts . However, this surge has not gone unnoticed. ZachXBT has raised suspicions, even accusing Garden Finance of enabling the laundering of funds associated with crypto thefts, including the notorious $1.4 billion Bybit hack . Kee reading to understand the whole story. ZachXBT Allegation On Garden Finance The recent allegations against Garden Finance has emerged in a surprising twist which is followed by a post by Jaz Gulati, the platform’s founder. In the prior post he highlighted its success by sharing an image of the fees collected in the first week of June. Interestingly, a known name in the crypto sector, ZachXBT, has come to light. As he accused the protocol of generating over 80% of its recent fees through the laundering of funds, allegedly with the assistance of Chinese launderers connected to the Lazarus Group. This claim by the onchain investigator, made on X earlier today at the end of the third week of June, has sparked significant interest within the crypto community. As this is raising severe and urgent questions about the trustworthiness of decentralized platforms. Garden Finance Founder Denies Allegations & Considers Baseless Following the ZachXBT’s allegations, Jaz Gulati, the founder of Garden Finance, responded by referencing a previous post where he stated that they had received 30 BTC well before the Bybit hack occurred. He attached a screenshot of this post from Q4 2024 to support his claim. Despite Gulati’s defense, ZachXBT doubled down, pointing to other hacks related to the DPRK, including the WazirX incident, which took place prior to the Bybit hack. He further questioned the legitimacy of Garden Finance, labeling it a “fake decentralized bridge.” In response, Gulati dismissed this characterization as misinformation, calling the “fake decentralized” label unfounded. ""fake decentralized"", again with the misinformation — Jaz (@jzgulati) June 21, 2025 In a subsequent comment, ZachXBT alleged that a single actor has been consistently topping up cbBTC’s liquidity from Coinbase for Chinese launderers while they moved the stolen funds from Bybit. However, Gulati has yet to respond to this specific accusation, despite his earlier quick replies. A New member Joins The Exchange After three hours of silence from Gulati, another user, James Scaur, joined the discussion, seemingly in support of Gulati. Scaur suggested that a Pareto distribution might apply, where a small number of liquidity providers (LPs) contribute the majority of liquidity. He noted that this doesn’t necessarily imply centralization; it could simply mean that only one LP was able to meet the demand at that time. On the topic of blocking swaps from hacked sources, Scaur acknowledged that it is a complex issue that remains difficult to resolve. More recently, ZachXBT delivered a blow to James Scaur’s support for the platform, as he once again criticized Garden Finance for its lack of decentralization, noting that since the cap for large swaps was raised to 10 cbBTC, only one entity has been fulfilling orders for weeks. He highlighted that outside of Bybit funds, the platform has minimal activity, making it easy to spot illicit transactions in the mempool. With Bybit-related transactions flooding in since April 2025, he pointed out that the team had been warned about this issue. Since the cap was raised for large swaps allowing up to 10 cbBTC it’s only been one single entity fulfilling orders for several weeks. Idk how you can call that decentralized… Outside of Bybit funds Garden has minimal activity thus it’s extremely easy to catch the illicit… — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) June 21, 2025 He suggested that if they cannot block these transactions, they should return the generated fees and disable larger swaps, rather than boasting about their fees while knowing their origins. Additionally, he mentioned that the 30 BTC in fees is largely due to an airdrop farming campaign from early 2024. The heated exchange of replies on X has since escalated into a public spat, but the allegation seems strong coming from ZachXBT’s findings. If the exchange continues then it could even prompt legal scrutiny for Garden finance. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-21T16:20:46,"Bitcoin Crash Coming Next Week? James Wynn’s $70M Short Position Says So","The post Bitcoin Crash Coming Next Week? James Wynn’s $70M Short Position Says So appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News With Bitcoin hovering around $103,500, well-known crypto trader James Wynn has made a bold prediction: the crypto market is about to crash hard . Wynn, who holds a $70 million short position on Bitcoin, warned on X (formerly Twitter) that rising tensions between Iran and Israel could spark a global crisis — possibly even World War 3 — if the U.S. gets involved. “If the USA gets involved, that is a declaration of a world war. Markets will nuke,” Wynn wrote . Crypto on the Edge The crypto market is already under pressure . In the past 24 hours, more than $481 million worth of trades have been liquidated, according to Coinglass. Bitcoin dropped 2%, now around $103,896. Ethereum (ETH) fell over 4.5%. Wynn says this weakness is caused by a mix of global tension, low liquidity, and fading investor confidence. “Lower Before Higher,” Says Wynn Despite the panic, Wynn remains confident that crypto will bounce back — but only after a major drop. He believes upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and money printing will push crypto into a new bull run later this year. “Crypto will win. But lower, before higher,” he stated. Still, for now, he’s doubling down on his bearish bet, increasing his $70 million short position. Investors Divided Wynn’s decision has sparked major debate. Some see it as a smart hedge during uncertain times, while others think it may miss the mark if the market recovers quickly. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is sending mixed signals — with one official hinting at rate cuts by July, while Fed Chair Jerome Powell advises caution. A Turning Point for Crypto? With global tensions rising and crypto already facing massive liquidations, the market could be on the brink of a major move.

2025-06-21T16:15:25,"Bitcoin price prediction 2025-2031: Will BTC hit $150k soon?","Key takeaways: Bitcoin price faces volatility around $104K. Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $103,507 (-0.5%) Market cap $2.11 Trillion Trading volume (24-hour) $42.13 Billion (+18.9%) Circulating supply 19.87 Million BTC All-time high $111,970; May 22, 2025 All-time low $0.04865; Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $104,616.96 24-hour low $102,372.44 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $103,507 Price Prediction $113,766 (+6.2%) Fear & Greed Index 61 (Greed) Sentiment Bullish Price Volatility 2.03% Green Days 17/30 (57%) 50-Day SMA $103,763 200-Day SMA $87,537 14-Day RSI 52.96 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin triggered a bearish pressure toward $103K. Resistance for BTC is at $107,869 Support for BTC/USD is at $102,703 The BTC price analysis for 21 June confirms that BTC faces a surge in volatility as the price first declined toward $103K. However, buyers are aiming for a surge as buying pressure recovers. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin price holds below $104K Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that Bitcoin faced strong bearish pressure as it dropped toward $103K. Sellers are strongly dominating the price chart, defending any sudden bullish reversals. The 24-hour volume has dropped to $1.16 billion, showing a decline in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $103,507, declining by over 0.5% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin shows mixed volatility : 1-day chart The RSI-14 trend line has dropped from its previous level and trades below the midline at 44.65, hinting that further bearish correction is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bearish domination rises around EMA trend lines The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bulls are strengthening their position to hold the price above the EMA trend lines. However, sellers are aiming for a trend continuation below $104K. Bitcoin aims for bearish volatility The BoP indicator trades in a negative region at 0.53, showing that short-term sellers are taking a chance to accelerate a downward trend. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $107,869, it will fuel a bullish rally to $109,561. Bitcoin Price Chart If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $102,703, beginning a bearish trend to $100,298. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin down today? Bitcoin faced a surge in bearish pressure as sellers defended further surges. This plunged the BTC price below $104K. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price recently broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $100K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Following the US, Pakistan announced its first government-backed strategic bitcoin reserve, marking a notable step towards adding crypto assets into its financial strategy. Bitcoin price prediction June 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance was notably weak, with a 12.5% loss, as per CoinGlass data, marking the worst first quarter since 2018. However, it made a strong comeback in Q2 as in the last few weeks of May, the price of Bitcoin made a new ATH at $111,970. Will Bitcoin continue its upward rally in June? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $113,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $97,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 $97,000 $105,000 $113,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970.

2025-06-21T16:10:02,"Bloomberg Analysts Bump Crypto ETF Approval Odds To 90%","Analysts at Bloomberg have recently released new updates that suggest that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is getting closer to approving more spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These ETFs allow people to invest in cryptocurrencies like XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano through regular stock markets. With these crypto funds, investors will not need to buy the tokens. Analysts now believe that these ETFs will be approved by the end of 2025. Bloomberg Analysts Raise Crypto ETFs Approval Odds to 90% In a recent X post , Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said he and his colleague Eric Balchunas now expect most spot crypto ETF applications to be approved. They believe the chances are 90% or higher. According to Seyffart, the recent engagement between the SEC and ETF applicants is a strong and positive signal. Just two weeks ago, the analysts had given lower chances for approval. Back then, they believed spot ETFs for XRP, Dogecoin, and Cardano had less than a 90% chance of being approved. Now, those coins are grouped with other popular cryptocurrencies like Solana, Litecoin, Polkadot, and Avalanche. They are all seen as having a 90% or higher chance of SEC approval. SEC Signals New Attitude Under New Chairman This growing confidence comes after a leadership change at the SEC. In April, Paul Atkins became the new chairman of the regulatory agency. Since then, he has shared plans for a more open and supportive approach to digital assets. Earlier this month, the SEC asked companies applying for spot Solana ETFs to update their S-1 forms. This request indicates that the SEC is preparing to move forward with approvals. Analysts and industry experts see this as a clear shift in how the agency deals with crypto products. Only Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are Approved In the U.S. Until now, the U.S. SEC has only approved spot crypto ETFs for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). These ETFs have become very popular and have brought in tens of billions of dollars from investors. They let people invest in crypto prices through traditional financial platforms without needing to hold the digital coins themselves. If the SEC approves more altcoin ETFs, it could make it easier and safer for more people to invest in crypto. Meanwhile, countries like Brazil and Canada have already approved an XRP ETF , while the U.S. is still hesitant to decide.

2025-06-21T16:08:24,"Sei price prediction: here’s why it has surged despite crypto crash","Sei price has bounced back in the past few days, even as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have plunged. The token rose to a high of $0.2200, its highest point since May 29, and 37% above the lowest point this year. Let’s explore why SEI crypto has soared and what to expect. Sei is becoming a major player in gaming The first main reason why Sei price has surged is that it has slowly become a major player in the gaming industry. Some of the top games leveraging its technology are Astro Karts, Celestial Flutters, and Dragon Land. DappRadar shows that Sei’s gaming unique active addresses have surged by 82% in the last 30 days to over 8.1 million. The number of gaming dApps in the network rose by 6, while transactions surged by 68% to $30 million. Sei’s numbers are much higher than the other chains like BSC Chain, Skale Network, WAX, Immutable, and Ronin. It means that it has more room to grow in the coming months as more games join. Read more: Sei price prediction: what next as SEI jumps 15%? Network growth is continuing The other main reason why the Sei price has jumped is that the network has become one of the fastest chains in the industry. Data shows that the number of transactions in the network jumped by 141% in the last 30 days to over 36 million. More users are joining the network, too. The number of active addresses on Sei has jumped bu 90% in the last 30 days to 7.8 million. Its addresses are higher thn that of popular chains like Ethereum, which had 6.9 million. More data shows that Sei’s total value locked (TVL) has jumped to $576 million, a few points below the all-time high of $608 million. It has jumped from a low of $220 million earlier this year. The biggest parts of Sei’s DeFi network are Yei Finance, Sailor, Takara Lend, and Pit Finance. Stablecoin growth and DEX volume While DeFi TVL is a good number, a better one is the stablecoin supply in the network. Its stablecoin market cap has jumped by over 7% in the last seven days to over $220 million. Sei started the year with less than $1 million in stablecoins. Its stablecoin supply is more than other popular chains, especially Cardano, which has just $30 million. Another notable metric is the DEX volume in its decentralized exchanges. Higher volume signals that investors are actively trading tokens generated using its network. Sei had a DEX volume of over $570 million in the last 30 days and $50 million in the last 24 hours. Sei token surged after it was shortlisted by the Wyoming Stable Token Commission to provide the blockchain for the WYST stablecoin. It will be the first of its kind issued by a US state. Sei price technical analysis SEI price chart | Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that the Sei price has been in a strong bearish trend in the past few weeks. It has formed a descending channel and has now moved above the 50-day moving average. Sei token has moved above the upper side of the descending channel. Further, the two lines of the MACD have formed a bullish crossover, a bullish sign. Therefore, Sei price will likely continue rising as bulls target the key resistance level at $0.2745, its highest point in May. A move above that level will point to more gains, potentially to $0.50.

2025-06-21T16:00:33,"Dogecoin Faces Pressure, Cardano Shifts Strategy, and Cold Wallet Gains as Best Crypto Coin to Buy","Three different moves in the crypto market are shaping investor focus. Dogecoin (DOGE) is testing the $0.17 level again as interest in meme-coins cools. Cardano (ADA) is planning a $100 million shift from its treasury into stablecoins and Bitcoin to help grow its slow DeFi sector. However, Cold Wallet (CWT) is showing a different kind of progress. It offers cold-storage security with a simple, chat-style layout and is already usable. At a presale price of $0.00906, it is positioning itself as the best crypto coin to buy for users who value strong privacy and real control. Dogecoin Nears Key Level: Can $0.17 Hold This Time? Dogecoin (DOGE) recently dropped under $0.20, raising new questions about its short-term support. The $0.17 zone is now being tested, and the overall trend in meme coins is adding more pressure. Some analysts view the dip below $0.20 as a possible entry point, with a chance for a bounce if enough buying returns around $0.17 to $0.18. But if that support breaks, deeper losses could follow. A quick rebound off $0.17 might trigger a strong rally as sentiment shifts. Dogecoin still has a large user base, and public attention can change fast. For those open to risk, this moment may offer short-term upside if price action holds. Can Cardano’s $100M Liquidity Plan Spark DeFi Growth? Cardano is preparing to shift $100 million in ADA from its treasury into Bitcoin and stablecoins. The goal is to strengthen its DeFi sector and improve stablecoin access on the network. At present, only about 10% of Cardano’s DeFi total value is held in stablecoins, well behind Ethereum and Solana. Supporters say this move could help grow liquidity and bring returns to the treasury without inflating ADA’s supply. The transition would be done in phases, using tools like time-weighted average pricing and private trades. Some warn this could pressure ADA’s price, but Charles Hoskinson believes the market can absorb the impact. For those watching Cardano’s DeFi space, this plan could mark an important step. A stronger link to stablecoins and Bitcoin may improve adoption and bring more use to its network. Cold Wallet Builds a New Way to Manage Crypto with Privacy in Mind Most crypto wallets are built for desktops and full dashboards, but many users are on mobile and want simplicity. Instead of tabs, charts, and extra plugins, Cold Wallet offers a layout that feels like a chat app. Behind that simple interface is cold storage-grade encryption. Every action is on-chain, encrypted, and kept away from central servers. There’s no need to jump between apps or use browser extensions. With Cold Wallet, users type a command, and it processes securely. The layout is simple, but the tech behind it is strong. There is no data tracking and no exposure of private keys. For those who care about privacy but do not want complex apps, Cold Wallet offers a direct option. At a presale price of $0.00906 in stage 14, it could be the right time to look closer. Cold Wallet is not just another crypto tool. It’s a new way to think about safe and easy crypto access on mobile. Comparing Cold Wallet to DOGE and ADA for 2025 Utility and Strength Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing weak support levels. Cardano (ADA) is working on rebuilding its DeFi presence through a large liquidity plan. Cold Wallet (CWT), by contrast, is not waiting on market trends or upgrades. It already functions with strong privacy and a mobile-first layout that focuses on ease of use. Cold Wallet blends high-level encryption with an interface that feels familiar and easy to manage. It is the first wallet that connects strong protection with a layout designed for comfort. As other crypto assets face uncertainty, CWT offers something already working. With the stage 14 presale price set at $0.00906, the timing may be important. For users focused on practical tools and data privacy, Cold Wallet stands out. It may be the best crypto coin to buy for those who value function over hype in 2025.

2025-06-21T16:00:02,"US Treasury Secretary Predicts 15x Stablecoin Growth — Bitcoin ‘Super Cycle’ To Follow?","Over the past week, the cryptocurrency sector achieved a major milestone after the United States Senate passed the GENIUS Act. This l andmark bill establishes the first federal standards for stablecoins, marking a significant victory for the digital asset sector and possibly the Bitcoin market. In response to this significant breakthrough, US Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent highlighted that stablecoins could grow into a $3.7 trillion industry by the end of the decade, especially with the introduction of the GENIUS Act. “A thriving stablecoin ecosystem will drive demand from the private sector for US Treasuries, which back stablecoins,” Bessent said. Besides the potential impact of a stablecoin market boom on the traditional sectors, there is also the significant effect such an amount of liquidity would have on the crypto market, especially Bitcoin. A renowned crypto journalist has come forward with how the Bitcoin price would react to a soaring stablecoin market value. Could BTC Price Go On A Super Rally? In a June 20 post on the X platform, crypto journalist Rafaela Romano shared an insightful analysis of the Bitcoin price performance in relation to a potential stablecoin market boom following recent legislative breakthroughs. This analysis is based on the “super” relationship between liquidity in stablecoins and the price of BTC. In the post on X, Romano highlighted the Stablecoin Ratio Channel (SRC) that indicates sustained bullish or bearish conditions based on changes in stablecoin supply. This metric suggests that shifts in stablecoin supply could precipitate significant market movement over extended periods. The SRC (Long-Term) removes short-term noise by applying a 90-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) to the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) oscillator and smoothing it with a 7-day EMA. For context, SSR is calculated as the ratio between the Bitcoin supply and the supply of stablecoins. Hence, a falling SRC metric suggests that the stablecoin supply is growing faster than the Bitcoin supply. As shown in the chart below, when the SRC reaches the green line, it indicates an oversold market condition for the premier cryptocurrency — a typical precedent for prolonged price rallies . Hence, if the stablecoin market capitalization sees a 15x growth over the coming years, it means that the value of the SRC would likely plummet beneath the green line. Ultimately, Romano believes that this could mean a “super multiple” for the price of Bitcoin .

2025-06-21T15:59:47,"Here Are Predicted Timelines for $10K in XRP to Turn $1 Million","Several experts in the crypto space have teased a future where XRP holders become millionaires from modest investments. XRP has held the $2 price level for the past six months. While this marks a massive 336% increase from its earlier $0.50 range, many believe XRP is still far from its ""destined"" valuation.Popular price forecasts place XRP’s potential between $10 and $100, with some ambitious projections even suggesting the $1,000 price level. Amid widespread optimism about XRP, this analysis explores how and when a $10,000 investment in XRP today could grow to make holders millionaires.How $10K in XRP Can Reach $1 MillionAt the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.10. A $10,000 investment would purchase approximately 4,762 XRP tokens. For this portfolio to reach $1 million in value, XRP would need to increase by 9,900%.This would require XRP’s unit price to hit $210. Accordingly, anyone holding at least 4,762 tokens would see their portfolio enter the million-dollar range.While the journey to $210 seems formidable, XRP delivered an even more dramatic surge during the 2017–2018 cycle, rising by over 700 times its value.However, XRP’s market capitalization has expanded significantly since then, and a full repeat of that historic performance in a single cycle is highly debated. For context, at a $210 price point, XRP’s market cap would exceed $12.3 trillion. This would surpass the combined valuations of major tech firms like Apple, Google, and NVIDIA. As a result, market watchers have varying opinions on when such a scenario might materialize.When XRP Price Could Reach $200+: Five Distinct TimelinesLast year, analyst Javon Marks suggested that XRP’s breakout from its largest-ever coil pattern indicated a potential run to $200. According to Marks, XRP’s seven-year consolidation from 2017 to 2024 mirrors a 2014–2017 pattern that preceded a rally to $3.84.While he slightly revised his expectations for 2025, he maintains a triple-digit price outlook for XRP this cycle. If this scenario holds, a $10K investment in XRP could approach $1 million. Other commentators in the XRP community share this perspective, with some projecting even higher prices, such as $305. However, research-based predictions from platforms like Telegaon and Changelly suggest XRP may take several years to reach the $200 price point required to turn $10K into $1 million.Specifically, Telegaon projects that XRP may not reach $236 until 2050, 25 years from now. Changelly offers a more optimistic timeline, estimating XRP could reach the $200 level between 2034 and 2040, up to 15 years from now.Many in the crypto community reject these longer timelines, dismissing them as pessimistic. Some suggest they likely originate from ""Bitcoin maxis"" unwilling to acknowledge XRP’s potential.Meanwhile, XRP enthusiasts take solace in a prediction by prominent analyst BarriC. He forecasts that XRP could reach $200 between 2032 and 2033.Interestingly, Matthew Brienen, COO of CryptoGuard, argues that XRP could reach $1,000 as early as 2035. This implies that he expects XRP to hit $200 much earlier.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/21/here-are-predicted-timelines-for-10k-in-xrp-to-turn-1-million/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=here-are-predicted-timelines-for-10k-in-xrp-to-turn-1-million,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction",cryptocompare
2025-06-21T15:58:25,"Here’s XRP Price If XRP ETFs Get 35% of Bitcoin ETF Flows, as Bloomberg Now Pegs Approval Odds at 95%","XRP might be looking at a massive price rally if spot XRP ETFs pull in even a slice of the capital that has poured into Bitcoin ETF products. Most recently, Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart confirmed that they have updated the chances of an XRP ETF approval to 95%. This has further triggered excitement about what that could mean for XRP's price.XRP Price if XRP ETFs Attract 35% of Bitcoin ETF InflowsNotably, if XRP ETFs attract a small fraction, say 35% of the net flows that Bitcoin ETFs have pulled in since launching in January 2024, our calculations indicate that XRP price could reach nearly $30. To put things into perspective, Bitcoin ETFs have seen $46.66 billion in net inflows since their launch. If XRP manages to pull in 35% of that, it will record about $16.331 billion in netflows. Such a development would have a tremendous impact on prices.Importantly, in market valuations, price doesn't rise one-for-one with capital inflows. Instead, traders use multipliers to estimate how inflows affect market cap. Some past multipliers reached 674x .However, for the sake of achieving a conservative estimate, we leveraged a more modest 100x multiplier, which gives a clearer picture without overhyping. At that rate, $16.331 billion in ETF inflows would add $1.633 trillion to XRP's value.Right now, XRP has a market cap of $125.87 billion and trades at $2.13, with a circulating supply of 58.93 billion tokens. If you add $1.633 trillion to its current market cap, the total jumps to $1.759 trillion. That puts XRP's projected price at $29.89 per token, nearly $30, considering the current circulating supply.Updates Surrounding XRP ETFsNotably, this scenario feels more realistic now that expectations around XRP ETF approvals have jumped. Bloomberg's Seyffart and Balchunas recently pointed to ongoing engagement from the U.S. SEC and said they believe approval will come; it's just a matter of time. Traders also show strong confidence on prediction platforms like Polymarket, where odds of an XRP ETF approval in 2025 have jumped to around 88%. XRP ETFs Approval Odds Polymarket XRP ETFs Approval Odds | Polymarket Institutional interest has also picked up. At press time, 2025, several major players, including Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, and Bitwise, have already filed applications for spot XRP ETFs, and those filings now sit under SEC review.Franklin Templeton's proposal has drawn the most attention. The firm filed in March 2025, and while the SEC recently delayed its decision again, the move followed standard procedure. The agency also opened a public comment window, giving investors until late July to weigh in on proposed rule changes.Meanwhile, Canada has already moved ahead . This week, the Toronto Stock Exchange rolled out three spot XRP ETFs, showing that global demand for regulated XRP investment products is real and growing.If U.S. regulators follow Canada's lead and XRP ETFs pick up just part of the traction Bitcoin ETFs have seen, XRP could be in for one of the biggest moves in its history.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/21/heres-xrp-price-if-xrp-etfs-get-35-of-bitcoin-etf-flows-as-bloomberg-now-pegs-approval-odds-at-95/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-xrp-price-if-xrp-etfs-get-35-of-bitcoin-etf-flows-as-bloomberg-now-pegs-approval-odds-at-95,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP","Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|Latest XRP ETF News Market Insights|XRP Price Prediction",cryptocompare

2025-06-21T15:30:13,"Bitcoin Price Breakdown Spurs Sell-Offs, Analyst Reveals What Will Happen If BTC Hits 92,800","The Bitcoin price crashed from as high as $106,000 to $102,000 on June 20, sparking sell-offs among investors. Now, crypto analyst Colin has indicated that the flagship crypto could still drop to as low as $92,800 and revealed what will happen if BTC gets there. The Current Bitcoin Price Action And What To Expect In an X post, Colin said that it looks increasingly likely that the Bitcoin price will see a retest of at least 100,800 as the first major level of support. The analyst made this statement as BTC dropped out of a bullish pennant for a second time. The measured target for this bull pennant is $150,000. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Could Rise 3x To $300,000 As AVIV Levels Resemble Previous Bull Cycles However, with the most recent breakdown, the Bitcoin price threatens to decline further before any potential move to the upside. Colin stated that the next major levels below $100,800 are $97,600 and $92,800. He opined that BTC is likely to quickly rebound from these support levels if it gets there. The crypto analyst remarked that this Bitcoin price movement is all possible within the confines of the right shoulder of the larger inverse Head-and-Shoulders pattern. He added that this can make the right shoulder more complete, basically on the same level as the left shoulder. This analysis comes just a day after Colin revealed that BTC has deviated from the global M2 money supply. However, he suggested that the BTC bull market is far from over. The analyst noted that the deviation happens 20% of the time and doesn’t invalidate the macro trend. Basically, the Bitcoin price is primed to rally higher at some point and possibly reach the $150,000 measured target. Market expert Raoul Pal also commented on BTC’s correlation with the money supply, stating that it shows that there is no need to worry about the current price action. Bulls Need To Step In For BTC In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto stated that the Bulls need to step in now for the Bitcoin price. He noted that BTC is facing a key test, having just been rejected at the Fair Value Gap at around $106,000. The analyst added that the flagship crypto is now retesting the lower boundary of the symmetrical triangle. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Could Rise 3x To $300,000 As AVIV Levels Resemble Previous Bull Cycles Titan of Crypto stated that if this lower boundary at around $104,000 fails, then the next level would be the previous weekly low at $102,679. If the Bitcoin price fails to hold that level, it could further drop to the liquidity pocket near $100,300.

2025-06-21T15:28:22,"Companies Are Racing to Build Bitcoin Treasuries","Several non-crypto companies are emulating MicroStrategy by buying and storing bitcoin, driving a dramatic 170% rise in corporate-held BTC. Altogether, around 130 public companies now own roughly 3.2% of bitcoin’s total supply. • MicroStrategy (now “Strategy”): Founder Michael Saylor set the trend in August 2020 when his firm started selling shares to buy bitcoin. Their market cap soared beyond the value of their holdings. Now with 592,100 BTC, they continue issuing equity and debt—$42 billion planned over three years—to accumulate more, confident they can weather even a 90% drop. • Twenty One Capital: This new firm emerged in May via a SPAC merger, backed by Tether and SoftBank. With about 37,230 BTC (worth nearly $3.9 billion), it aims to rival Strategy as the leading listed bitcoin accumulation vehicle. • Tesla: Elon Musk’s company first bought $1.5 billion in bitcoin in 2021, briefly sold most of it in 2022, and has since restocked. Tesla recorded a $600 million accounting gain last year thanks to crypto valuation rules. • Metaplanet: Originally a hotel developer, this Tokyo firm pivoted in 2024 to follow Strategy’s model. With 10,000 BTC now, it plans to reach 210,000 by 2027. Eric Trump even advises the company. • Block (formerly Square): Under Jack Dorsey, Block began buying BTC in October 2020. Now the company invests 10% of monthly gross profits from its bitcoin services back into holdings, aiming to solidify bitcoin’s role as the “internet’s native currency.” • Next Technology Holding: The Chinese AI software company jumped from 833 BTC late last year to 5,833 BTC in Q1 2025 after issuing shares and warrants to fund their crypto acquisition strategy. Nasdaq even warned about delisting before the move. • GameStop: The memestock-stock icon entered the bitcoin space in late May, purchasing 4,710 BTC via a $512 million convertible bond offering. Despite initial share-price drops, it's already preparing a second $2.25 billion bond issue. • Semler Scientific: This US healthcare-tech firm replaced its cash reserves with bitcoin starting in May 2024. With 4,449 BTC bought via cash, equity issuance, and $100 million in bonds, Semler’s share price hasn’t soared—but it's holding steady at a valuation close to its bitcoin assets. • Trump Media & Technology Group: Though currently holding no bitcoin, Trump’s media firm aims to build a treasury portfolio worth $2.5 billion. No purchases are scheduled yet, but a pro-crypto regulatory push is expected under his influence.

Schiff called the US dollar a “flawed fiat currency,” emphasizing the need for a gold-backed stablecoin instead. “I get Bitcoin, but not U.S. dollar stablecoins,” Schiff opined in a Friday post on X. “If you’re going to introduce a third-party custodian, why settle for a token backed by a flawed fiat currency like the dollar, when you can own one backed by gold? You get the same liquidity, but you also get a real store of value.” A stablecoin is a crypto token whose price is pegged to a stable currency, mostly the U.S. dollar. This is normally done by holding a reserve of dollars and other assets that cover the cost of the issued stablecoins. Crypto traders use stablecoins to enter and exit positions without having to access fiat currencies directly, particularly in markets where U.S. dollars are prohibited or unreachable. These assets can also be used to make payments or send remittances abroad in real-time and at much lower costs compared to traditional rails. When one X user urged Schiff to introduce a gold-backed stablecoin, Schiff noted that such a coin already exists and added that he plans to launch his own. The stablecoin market is currently dominated by U.S. dollar-backed tokens like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. Stablecoins Are Poised To Explode Schiff’s comments come as the U.S. Senate passed the GENIUS Act to regulate the fast-growing stablecoin industry. The legislation now heads to the House, and President Donald Trump expects to sign it into law by August. As previously covered by ZyCrypto , retail giants Amazon and Walmart, and other multinational companies are considering launching their own stablecoins. The stablecoin market has grown to over $260 billion, with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent predicting that it could become a $3.7 trillion asset class by the end of the decade, especially with the passage of the GENIUS Act.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/peter-schiff-claims-he-gets-bitcoin-but-not-dollar-pegged-stablecoins-plans-to-launch-gold-backed-alternative/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Peter Schiff|Stablecoins",cryptocompare
2025-06-21T15:20:57,"Top crypto price predictions: Grass, Uniswap, Virtuals Protocol","Bitcoin and most altcoins crashed on Saturday, continuing the recent plunge. BTC dropped below $104,000, after falling by over 6.5% from its highest point this month. This article looks at some top altcoins like Grass (GRASS), Uniswap (UNI), and Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL). Grass price forecast GRASS token chart | Source: TradingView Grass is a top artificial intelligence token that creates a win-win situation to its users. Users download and install the application and earn tokens, which they can convert into fiat during the airdrop. Grass price has been in a freefal, and has now plunged to its lowest level since March. It has dropped in the last six consecutive days, and has fallen by over 55% from its highest level in June. Grass token has moved below the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swing since February 7 this year. Moving below that level confirmed the descending momentum. Grass price has dropped below the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and other oscillators have all pointed downwards. The Average Directional Index (ADX) has continued rising, a sign that the trend is strengthening. Therefore, the token will likely continue falling, with the next point to watch being at $1. A move below that support will point to more downside, potentially to the all-time low of $0.9118.

The token dropped below the important support level at $7.5410, its highest point in May. UNI has moved below the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level at $8. The two lines of the MACD indicator have formed a bearish crossover pattern, signaling more downside ahead. On the positive side, Uniswap price remains above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average. The most likely scenario is where Uniswap price continues falling as sellers target the next key support level at $4.8252, its lowest point on May 7 this year. A move above the resistance at $8.68 will invalidate the bearish view. Virtuals Protocol price forecast VIRTUAL price chart | Source: TradingView The VIRTUAL token has crashed in the past few months, moving from a high of $1.8050 on May 27 to the current $1.40. The eight-hour chart shows that it has dropped below the 50-period Exponential Moving Average. Most importantly, it has formed a head-and-shoulders pattern, a popular bearish continuation sign. It has now moved below this pattern’s neckline, a sign that bears have prevailed. Therefore, the token will likely continue falling as sellers target the next key support at $1. This price is both a psychological point and also the H&S target. The target of a H&S is established by measuring the distance between the head and the neckline and the same one from the neckline.

Investors are worried about the US getting involved in the conflict after President Trump warned Iran about not signing a deal. The flagship cryptocurrency plunged from an intraday high of $106,513 on Friday as markets turned bearish. It fell to a low of $102,446 before settling at $103,388, ultimately registering a drop of 1.19%. BTC is down nearly 2% over the past 24 hours, trading around $103,495. Semler Scientific Discloses Ambitious Bitcoin Strategy Healthcare technology firm Semler Scientific has announced an ambitious Bitcoin accumulation plan to expand its Bitcoin holdings aggressively. The company also announced the appointment of Joe Burnett as the Director of Bitcoin Strategy. Semler Scientific plans to increase its Bitcoin holdings to 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025, 42,000 BTC by the end of 2026, and 105,000 by the end of 2027. It plans to use proceeds from equity and debt financing and cash flows from operations to fund the purchases. “Semler Scientific also announced that it plans to hold 10,000 bitcoins by year-end 2025, 42,000 by year-end 2026, and 105,000 by year-end 2027, using proceeds from equity and debt financings and cash flows from operations.” Burnett stated that Semler Scientific is committed to expanding its Bitcoin reserves in a way that could benefit shareholders who believe Bitcoin is the ultimate long-term asset. Semler Scientific was optimistic about Burnett’s appointment as its Director of Bitcoin Strategy, stating, “We are excited to have Joe join our Bitcoin strategy team and help drive our three-year plan to own 105,000 bitcoins. Joe is an analytical thought leader on Bitcoin and Bitcoin treasury companies. His expertise will be instrumental as we pursue our bitcoin treasury strategy and aim to deliver long-term value to our stockholders.” Worries About A Post-Trump Bitcoin Eric Semler, the chairman of healthcare firm Semler Scientific Inc., has revealed that many hedge fund executives are skeptical and worried about Bitcoin’s prospects once President Trump leaves office. Semler stated in an interview with Natalie Brunell, “I think that they think it is a fly-by-night concept and that it is probably going to, after the Trump administration, go back down a lot.” Semler, also the founder of TCS Capital Management, made the comments amid growing skepticism within the crypto industry about how long the support for crypto will last once President Trump exits office. Some prominent figures, like Jan3 founder Samson Mow, are concerned that support for crypto could vanish under a future president. However, Semler has doubled down on Bitcoin , with Semler Scientific becoming the second publicly traded company in the US to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy. The company has announced an aggressive Bitcoin acquisition plan to take its holdings to 105,000 BTC . “When you’re making a bet on something that the majority doesn’t believe in, and you’re right, you make so much more money. I think we got great opportunities to show people that basically they’re missing out on a great opportunity.” Hedge Funds Turning To Bitcoin A survey by the Alternative Investment Management Association and PwC in October 2024 revealed that 47% of hedge fund managers are exposed to crypto. This is up from 29% in 2023. Meanwhile, 37% of the respondents said they had no exposure to crypto in 2022. In 2021, Intertrust surveyed chief financial officers from 100 hedge funds about plans to purchase crypto assets, including Bitcoin. 98% of them responded that they expect hedge funds to invest at least 7% of their assets in crypto by 2026. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) registered an alarming slump on Friday as market sentiment worsened thanks to escalating geopolitical tensions. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency dropped from an intraday high of $106,513 to $102,446 before reclaiming $103,000 and settling at $103,388. Markets have been under tremendous pressure thanks to macroeconomic factors and geopolitical uncertainty. This led to the crypto market falling nearly 1.50% on June 21, wiping out $240 billion in value. One of the biggest triggers for BTC and the crypto market’s decline is the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Investors and market watchers are worried about the US getting involved in the conflict after President Trump adopted a hardline stance and issued a veiled threat to Iran’s supreme leader. Trump has also warned Iran over not signing a deal when it had the opportunity. Bitcoin whales are also selling their holdings as they lock their profits, putting more pressure on the price. According to data from Glassnode, wallets that held BTC for 6-12 months sold over $900 million of the asset in recent weeks as they began cashing out. Long-term Bitcoin holders took home $1.2 billion in profits in early June. Liquidations have also put pressure on the price, as many traders using leverage were wiped out thanks to BTC’s recent price action. Over the past 24 hours, over $500 million in crypto positions were liquidated, affecting over 134,000 traders. BTC started the previous week in positive territory, surging over 4% to cross the 20-day SMA and $110,000 to settle at $110,247. The price fell to an intraday low of $108,325 on Tuesday before recovering to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,258. BTC lost momentum on Wednesday, falling 1.43% to $108,686. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price plunged nearly 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,826. BTC fell to an intraday low of $102,854 on Friday as selling pressure persisted. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase, reclaim $106,000, and settle at $106,106. Source: TradingView Sellers regained control on Saturday as BTC fell 0.59% to $105,482 before registering a marginal increase on Sunday and settling at $105,561. BTC started the week on a bullish note, surging to an intraday high of $108,939 before settling at $106,808, ultimately registering an increase of $106,808. Price action turned negative on Tuesday as BTC fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $105,000 to $104,519. The flagship cryptocurrency faced volatility on Wednesday but registered a marginal increase and moved to $104,884. It was back in the red on Thursday, dropping 0.24% to $104,631. BTC raced to an intraday high of $106,513 but lost momentum after reaching this level, eventually falling below the 20-day SMA and settling at $103,388. The current session sees the price marginally up, trading around $103,781. Buyers will look to maintain control and push BTC beyond $105,000.

2025-06-21T14:40:27,"Ethereum spot ETF Flows See Crucial Shift as Outflows Hit $11.3M","BitcoinWorld Ethereum spot ETF Flows See Crucial Shift as Outflows Hit $11.3M The nascent U.S. Ethereum spot ETF market experienced a notable shift on June 20, recording its first day of net outflows after a promising four-day streak of positive inflows. This development has caught the attention of investors closely watching the impact of these new investment vehicles on the broader crypto market . Understanding Recent ETH ETF Flows After kicking off trading with significant interest, the various U.S. ETH ETF products saw cumulative inflows exceeding $100 million in the days leading up to June 20. However, the latest data indicates a reversal in this trend, with a net outflow of $11.3 million recorded on Thursday. Breaking down the numbers provides a clearer picture of which funds saw movement: BlackRock’s ETHA: This fund, which had previously seen strong inflows, experienced the largest single outflow on June 20, totaling $19.7 million. Grayscale’s ETH: In contrast to BlackRock, Grayscale’s fund recorded a net inflow of $6.6 million. Grayscale’s product typically sees different flow dynamics due to its conversion from a trust structure. Other Funds: Several other issuers also saw minor inflows or outflows, contributing to the overall net figure. Here’s a quick look at the key movements on June 20: ETF Ticker Issuer Net Flow (June 20) ETHA BlackRock -$19.7M ETH Grayscale +$6.6M (Aggregated Others) Various +$1.8M Total Net Flow -$11.3M What Does This Shift in ETF Flows Mean? While an $11.3 million outflow might seem small compared to the billions seen in Bitcoin ETFs, it’s a significant event for the newly launched Ethereum spot ETF market. This outflow ends the initial positive momentum and could signal a period of volatility or caution among investors. Several factors could contribute to this shift: Profit Taking: Some investors might be taking profits after the initial excitement and price movements following the ETF launches. Market Uncertainty: Broader economic concerns or shifts in the overall crypto market sentiment can influence investment decisions in specific assets like Ethereum. Rebalancing: Institutional investors might be rebalancing their portfolios, leading to temporary outflows from certain positions. Initial Volatility: New ETF products often experience choppy ETF flows in their early trading days as market participants find equilibrium. Analyzing the Impact on Ethereum Price The relationship between ETF flows and asset prices is complex. While large inflows are generally seen as bullish indicators, and outflows as bearish, the impact on Ethereum price isn’t always immediate or direct. Ethereum’s price is influenced by a multitude of factors, including network activity, regulatory news, and overall market sentiment. This initial outflow, while a change in trend, is relatively small in the context of Ethereum’s overall market capitalization and daily trading volume. Therefore, predicting a major price drop based solely on this single day’s data would be speculative. However, sustained outflows over a longer period could put downward pressure on the price, just as sustained inflows could drive it up. Key Takeaways and Actionable Insights Monitor Flows Closely: While one day doesn’t make a trend, watching subsequent days’ ETH ETF flow data will be crucial to understand if this is a temporary blip or the start of a new pattern. Context is Key: Compare Ethereum ETF flows to Bitcoin ETF flows and the broader crypto market performance to gain perspective. Long-Term View: The introduction of the Ethereum spot ETF is a long-term development aimed at providing traditional investors easier access to ETH. Short-term flow volatility is expected. Diversify Information Sources: Don’t rely solely on ETF flow data. Keep track of other fundamental and technical indicators for Ethereum. The end of the four-day inflow streak for U.S. Ethereum spot ETF s with an $11.3 million net outflow on June 20 marks a moment of pause in the initial enthusiasm. While the amount is modest, the reversal in trend highlights the dynamic nature of ETF flows in nascent markets. Investors should continue to monitor these flows alongside other market indicators to gauge the potential impact on the Ethereum price and the overall health of the crypto market . This is just the beginning for Ethereum ETFs, and their journey will likely involve periods of both inflows and outflows as the market matures.

A court has issued the preliminary approval of a deal that awards a total of $2.3 million to the more than 71,000 victims impacted by a cybersecurity attack at Sysco, a major food distribution company. The funds are for “all individuals who reside in the United States to whom Sysco sent notice of the cybersecurity event in or around May 2023.” The data breach compromised personal information, including names, Social Security numbers, account numbers and other personal information that Sysco had for payroll purposes, such as phone numbers, addresses and email addresses. Under the terms of the deal, the victims are entitled to up to $5,000 in documented losses due to the data breach, including costs to combat identity theft or as a result of identity theft, as well as an additional payment estimated to be between $100 and $200 but up to $599. The lawsuit, filed by Sysco truck driver Joseph Trottier, accuses the company of failing “to take and implement adequate and reasonable measures to ensure that the PII (personally identifiable information) of Plaintiff and Class Members was safeguarded, failing to take available steps to prevent an unauthorized disclosure of data, and failing to follow applicable, required and appropriate protocols, policies and procedures regarding the encryption of data, even for internal use.” The lawsuit says the stolen personal info “can be sold on the Dark Web.” “Hackers can access and then offer for sale the unencrypted, un-redacted PII to criminals. Plaintiff and Class Members now face a lifetime risk of (i) identity theft, which is heightened here by the loss of Social Security numbers, and (ii) the sharing and detrimental use of their sensitive information.” In a notice sent to the victims, Sysco had said that it learned in March 2023 that a “threat actor gained access to our systems without authorization and claimed to have acquired certain data.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Texas resident Gary Cunningham is suing PlainsCapital Bank and Pathward N.A. after $20,000 was fraudulently transferred from his account, reports Fox 26. The fraud happened after criminals hacked Cunningham’s email and used AI to clone his voice and convince his accountant to transfer $20,000 to a Pathward Financial account instead of the usual Chase account. At the time, his accountant was being deceived, Cunningham was traveling. The 76-year-old, who is representing himself in court, says the institutions should have better protections against AI-initiated fraud. I believe I have enough information here to force the banks to do something different because they were negligent – grossly negligent. “[The accountant] was convinced it was me talking to her – but I didn’t – I was on a plane to Chicago. There’s no way that was me.” While Cunningham is not a trained lawyer, he tells Fox 26 he learned the court process from his late wife and was also guided by a couple of friends who are lawyers. The lawsuit comes at a time when financial fraud against elderly Americans is on the rise. Annually, elderly Americans are losing over $3 billion per year to fraud, according to the FBI.

2025-06-21T14:25:34,"Bitcoin Whales Withdraw from Binance, New Best Presale Contender Attracts Huge Investor Surge","Bitcoin Whales Trigger Crypto Market Shift The recent swings in the Bitcoin market have sent waves of caution through crypto communities. Big withdrawals from centralized platforms like Binance are showing that whales—big Bitcoin holders—might be repositioning or reducing their Bitcoin exposure amid apparent regulatory uncertainty and security issues. As these influential players make big moves, more and more retail investors are also making a shift, looking to find and fund decentralized and transparent opportunities that they see as safer. Within this context, the Neo Pepe Presale is now over $1.3 million funded, doing quite well in what is currently a not-so-bullish presale crypto market. They are in stage four of their presale, with some of the tokens selling for $0.08, on their way, we presume, to some steep token price increases after the presale is over. How Bitcoin Whale Movements Impact Market Moves Bitcoin whale movements are more usual indicators than instigators, frequently shining a light on larger shifts in the market’s feel. Recent outflows from Binance, however, are simply raising too many eyebrows and seem to be prompting a lot of second-guessing and rethinking. Investors who are not in full-blown panic mode are at least nudged closer to that realm when they consider 1. the total amounts being withdrawn; 2. the percentage of Binance’s total in/out flow that these withdrawals and the associated market making and money moving back and forth seem to indicate; and 3. the apparent internal/external governance problems at Binance and its affiliated companies that these withdrawals call into question. As speculative investigation begins to cause investor panic, one of the only ways out is seemingly through Neo Pepe Coin and the governance problems it solves. These features mark it as one of the surefire best crypto presale contenders of the year. Transparent Presale Structure Builds Investor Confidence Neo Pepe has emerged as a top pepe coin thanks to its robust presale strategy. That strategy is fully transparent and verifiable through on-chain activity. How is the presale so transparent? Because, unlike opaque projects that have a presale, Neo Pepe operates under a model called decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). And that presale, ladies and gentlemen, has a multisig approach to overseeing what goes where and with whom concerning your tokens and treasury. Now, young whales and old codgers might ask: ""Why care about transparency during the presale? Centralized projects are centralized for a reason. Do I have to eliminate de facto centralization to achieve this level of transparency?"" In the face of market manipulation from massive movement of whales, there’s your answer. You might want to pick up a little Neo Pepe as its early-stage pricing gives you considerable incentives for seeking presale opportunities. $NEOP’s Unique Positioning in Crypto’s Future Investor demand for transparency in cryptocurrency markets changed from something that some might characterize as a luxury to an overall requirement in 2025. Neo Pepe meets this demand through what could best be described as a trustless, open-source operation. Much of the trust that investors might have in a presale is built on the mechanisms that are employed to release the tokens in a manner that doesn't put too much downward pressure on the market. Neo Pepe's presale ostensibly employs such mechanisms. Yet, there's much more to Neo Pepe than just operating in a trustless fashion that makes the presale investor-friendly. There are also the automatic trust assurances that come with the kind of open-source operation that provides mechanism transparency. How Neo Pepe is Enhancing Decentralized Finance Participating in decentralized finance (DeFi) is not enough for Neo Pepe—it is actively enriching this part of the crypto universe through innovations in governance and financial security. Neo Pepe sharply reduces several familiar risks associated with traditional crypto investments. By decentralizing treasury control and establishing clear, auditable processes, it reduces the kind of uncertainty that can lead to catastrophic losses. Its smart contract outlines the process for managing treasury funds far too well for anyone to mistake it for the kind of secretive operation that led to the collapse of FTX. This active participation model is particularly appealing in an era where investors seek more meaningful control and less exposure to centralized financial pitfalls. Neo Pepe's Big Moment—Youtuber Asks Is This Coin Really Crypto’s Future? Crypto analyst Gems Booster examines this upcoming top pepe coin presale, with a sharp eye and sharper commentary, the presale of Neo Pepe. They unpack what sets this ambitious meme coin apart and what might hold it back. Their conclusion is that the presale is indeed carefully crafted and innovative, with layered strategy that escalates excitement through clearly defined pricing stages. Yet, even as they laud the sophistication (and, more importantly, the practicality) of Neo Pepe's auto-liquidity protocol, they remain lightly skeptical. After all, as Gems Booster points out, a truly innovative project with bold ideas is not always a sure bet in the current crypto market. They offer a set of potential obstacles that could stand in Neo Pepe's way and provide some vivid, honest commentary. You won't find more straightforward coverage around. 3 Key Reasons to Participate in Neo Pepe Coin’s Presale Full On-Chain Transparency – Every action is visible on the blockchain, ensuring accountability and fostering trust among early investors.

2025-06-21T14:07:36,"Russia ramps up search for ‘black miners’ implicated in 1.3 trillion-ruble loss","Russian grid operator Rosseti has set out to hunt down what it calls “black miners,” or those mining cryptocurrencies on stolen electricity worth billions of rubles. The power company, one of the largest in the world, announced it’s now working with Russian telecoms to expand its toolkit for identifying illegal crypto mining farms across the vast country. Rosseti to catch illegal crypto miners by analyzing internet traffic State-controlled Rosseti, the energy giant uniting regional grid operators in Russia, is elaborating a new mechanism to pinpoint illegal mining facilities, its head told journalists on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum ( SPIEF ). Andrei Ryumin, who chairs Rosseti’s management board and serves as its director general, revealed that the company is currently working with Russian mobile operators Rostelecom and Mobile TeleSystems (MTS) on the matter, the business news portal RBC reported. The group hopes they can identify mining farms by following internet traffic. Ryumin explained: “For example, if data is transferred in large volumes, then this is mining. We are currently interacting with them so that they can locate such facilities and help us understand if they are legal.” The technology to do that is there, the official added. Meanwhile, MTS confirmed it has already provided Rosseti with access to its EnergyTool, an AI-based solution that analyzes not only internet traffic but also a number of other indicators, such as data from smart electricity meters. “Areas with abnormal traffic are indicated on the map, which helps energy workers find illegal cryptocurrency mining more effectively,” said Oleg Aldoshin, vice president of corporate business at MTS, the largest telecommunications firm and mobile network operator in Russia. According to its stats, the number of mining farms in the Russian Federation has increased by 9% in the first five months of 2025. Mining, as an industry, has been growing since its legalization in the country last year. To mine legally, companies and individual entrepreneurs are required to register with the Federal Tax Service (FNS) and pay their taxes . However, according to the authority, less than a third of active miners have so far done so. ‘Black miners’ caused $16.5 million in damages in 2024 According to Rosseti’s calculations, the so-called “black miners,” who tap into electricity networks illegally to mint digital coins, caused financial damages of more than 1.3 billion rubles ($16.5 million) last year alone. In reality, the losses are much higher than the estimate, Andrei Ryumin is convinced. He also noted: “We identify only part of the black mining.” The differential tariff for electricity distributed to the population, which was introduced in early 2025, is only good for combating “gray miners,” the executive also remarked. In Russia’s terminology, small miners who mine at their homes are often called “gray” as they are not required to register as mining enterprises with the FNS if their consumption does not exceed 6,000 kWh of electricity monthly. Differential rates allow Russian utilities to keep their consumption in check as they are charged more than regular households for the larger amounts of electricity powering improvised mining rigs in basements and garages. At the same time, “black” miners are those who burn energy completely outside the law by illegally connecting their hardware to public grids. “And the more expensive bitcoin is, the more of them there are,” the head of Rosseti pointed out. The power giant is also keeping track of the geographical distribution of illegal mining activities. According to the company’s estimates, Dagestan, along with other Russian republics in the North Caucasus, has the largest concentration of black miners, followed by some parts of Siberia . So far, mining has been banned in almost a dozen energy-deficient regions of the country, but critics say the restrictive measures mostly affect legal mining businesses.

2025-06-21T14:00:25,"Ethereum Charts Signal Potential Bottom – All Eyes On Next Move","Ethereum is once again trading at critical demand levels, testing the lower boundary of a six-week range that began forming in early May. After briefly climbing toward $2,800 earlier this month, ETH has retraced back to the $2,400 zone, reigniting debate about whether this is a healthy consolidation or a sign of further downside to come. Despite the pressure, Ethereum has not broken below this range, signaling that buyers continue to step in at these levels. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Sees $123 And $116 As Mid-Zone Support Levels – Here’s Why This extended consolidation period suggests a decisive move is nearing. Breakouts from tight ranges like this one often lead to strong directional momentum, and ETH’s current price structure could act as a launchpad—if bulls regain control. According to top analyst M-log1, Ethereum may have already bottomed during its most recent retrace, with the current action reflecting accumulation rather than weakness. The ETH/BTC ratio, another critical chart watched by traders, is also hovering near support levels, implying that a rotation back into altcoins may be imminent if Ethereum holds or pushes higher. For now, the market watches closely, as ETH’s next move could set the tone for broader altcoin performance in the weeks ahead. Ethereum Holds Range As Market Awaits Decisive Break Ethereum continues to trade within a tight consolidation range that began in early May, showing resilience despite growing global tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty. The price has hovered between $2,360 and $2,700, forming a narrow channel as buyers and sellers remain locked in a standoff. With conflicts in the Middle East intensifying and financial markets reacting to high interest rates and rising Treasury yields, crypto assets are under pressure, and Ethereum is no exception. The long-anticipated altseason has yet to materialize, and Ethereum is widely seen as the key to unlocking that next phase. ETH’s dominance in the smart contract and DeFi space gives it a central role in leading altcoin market momentum. Traders and analysts are closely monitoring its current range, especially after M-log1 shared analysis suggesting the recent low at $2,360 could mark a local bottom. According to M-log1, Ethereum is now consolidating just below the $2,450 level, and this zone could serve as a bullish trigger if reclaimed with strength. A decisive move in either direction will likely set the tone for the broader crypto market, with a breakout above $2,500 potentially igniting the next leg upward. Until then, market participants are watching closely. If ETH fails to hold these demand levels, the range could break to the downside, delaying any altseason rally further. But if bulls regain control and push above key resistance, it could signal the start of a much-anticipated upward move. In this environment of uncertainty, Ethereum’s next breakout-or breakdown—could prove pivotal for market sentiment heading into the second half of the year. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For A Decisive Move: ETH/BTC Setup Could Trigger Altseason ETH Tests Key Support As Price Retraces Ethereum is currently trading at $2,405, down 4.17% in the last session, after testing a low of $2,367. The chart reveals that ETH has retraced back to the lower boundary of a six-week range, confirming strong demand in the $2,360–$2,400 area. This zone has acted as a critical support level multiple times, with bulls stepping in each time to defend it. The price remains trapped below the 200-day moving average ($2,774), which has proven to be a strong resistance. Meanwhile, both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages are trending below price, currently sitting at $2,287 and $2,640, respectively, tightening the range even more. This compression typically leads to high volatility once a breakout occurs. Related Reading: Ethereum Mirrors Bitcoin 2017-2021 Pattern – $4,000 Is The Trigger Point Volume has remained elevated during recent sessions, suggesting that buyers and sellers are actively competing for control. A decisive close below $2,360 could trigger a cascade toward $2,100 or lower. Conversely, if bulls manage to reclaim $2,500 and sustain momentum toward the $2,700–$2,800 resistance band, it may set the stage for a breakout.
