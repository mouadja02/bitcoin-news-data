Altcoins to Drop 50–80%, Bitcoin to Face 45% Crash appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is down 3% today, bringing the total market cap to $3 trillion. Bitcoin has dropped to $103,000, down 1.1%. Major altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP are also down by up to 3%, while memecoins such as Dogecoin, Litecoin, and others continue to slide. Top analyst Crypto Capo had recently issued a strong warning saying, “We haven’t seen anything yet.” He warns that altcoins are already dropping hard, even though Bitcoin is still above $100K. Altcoins Could Drop 50–70%, Memecoins To Face 80% Wipeout He identifies two key support levels for Bitcoin: first at $93,000 and then the main support zone between $60K and $ 70 K. This would be a 35-45% decline from the current prices. In a full-blown capitulation or a Black Swan scenario, the analyst says Ethereum could drop 45-55% and reach the $1000-$1200 range. Altcoins are expected to drop 50-70% on average, while memecoins could be hit the hardest. They could crash by up to 60-80%, as per the analyst. He expects the real drop to begin once Bitcoin breaks the $100,000 level. That is when bearish momentum could accelerate sharply. He also shared a few examples of coins that are already collapsing before Bitcoin’s drawdown. Charts Point to Memecoin Meltdown Crypto Capo’s charts show memecoins are on the edge of major breakdowns. FARTCOIN is at risk of dropping 61% to the first support zone around $0.38, and possibly 82% drop to $0.17 if it falls further. RETARDIO is stuck below resistance and showing weakness. Despite several bounces, it’s stuck in a lower range, showing signs of exhaustion. PEPE has triggered a bearish Head and Shoulders pattern, with an expected 70% drop ahead. Slow Bleed Continues CryptoQuant data also shows that altcoins are still deep in a slump. Altcoin Sherpa notes that the top gainers like Fartcoin, SPX, and $HYPE are pulling back the hardest, while the rest of the market is in a slow, steady bleed. He also expects coins like POPCAT to continue drifting lower, with no major liquidations or panic selling so far. Most altcoins look weak, and the analyst sees no strong buy signals at the moment. I still expect coins like $POPCAT to continue to bleed a bit lower, this has been a slow controlled sell off w. no huge liquidations or anything. just endless stairs down. pic.twitter.com/xgNspITj3r — Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) June 21, 2025 Calm Before the Altcoin Storm? However, analyst Michaël van de Poppe says that altcoins have been flat for the past three months, simply retesting lows.

2025-06-21T07:50:55,"Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong: Why the World Desperately Needs Crypto Now","BitcoinWorld Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong: Why the World Desperately Needs Crypto Now In a recent and impactful statement, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong took to social media to share a powerful message resonating with many in the digital asset space: the World needs crypto , perhaps now more than at any point in recent history. This isn’t just a bold claim from a figurehead in the industry; it’s a perspective rooted in observing significant global economic trends that he believes cryptocurrency is uniquely positioned to address. Why Does Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong Believe Crypto is Essential? Brian Armstrong’s assertion stems from several critical global economic challenges. He specifically highlighted three major concerns driving his conviction: Exponentially Growing Debt Levels: Across nations, both public and private debt continues to balloon. This unsustainable growth raises questions about future economic stability and the potential for currency devaluation as governments potentially resort to printing more money to service debt. Widespread Inflation: Many countries are grappling with persistent inflation, eroding purchasing power and making it harder for individuals and families to save and maintain their standard of living. Traditional financial systems often struggle to contain this, leaving citizens vulnerable. Erosion of Economic Freedom: Armstrong argues that economic freedom is being chipped away globally. This can manifest in various ways, from capital controls and censorship of transactions to limited access to financial services for large portions of the world’s population. According to the Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong , these intertwined issues create a pressing need for alternative financial systems that are more resilient, accessible, and permissionless than traditional finance. He sees crypto as that necessary alternative. Exploring the Core Crypto Benefits Armstrong Highlights When we talk about why the World needs crypto , we’re really talking about the fundamental advantages that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology offer in the face of the challenges Armstrong outlined. The crypto benefits that stand out include: Decentralization: Unlike traditional currencies controlled by central banks, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin operate on decentralized networks. This removes single points of control and potential failure, offering a degree of independence from government fiscal policies that can lead to inflation or debt crises. Permissionless Access: Anyone with an internet connection can access and use cryptocurrencies. This is a massive step towards global financial inclusion, particularly for the estimated 1.7 billion adults worldwide who remain unbanked but may have mobile phones. This directly combats the erosion of economic freedom by providing financial tools to everyone. Transparency and Security: Transactions on public blockchains are transparent (though parties can be pseudonymous) and secured by cryptographic principles. This contrasts with opaque traditional financial systems and offers a level of security against censorship or arbitrary seizure. Potential Hedge Against Inflation: While volatile, some cryptocurrencies, particularly those with capped supplies like Bitcoin, are viewed by proponents as a potential store of value and a hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies caused by inflation and excessive money printing. Understanding crypto and inflation dynamics is crucial for many seeking alternatives to traditional savings methods. These inherent features form the bedrock of Armstrong’s argument that crypto is not just a speculative asset class, but a vital tool for navigating the current global economic landscape. How Does Crypto Offer Economic Freedom Crypto? The concept of Economic freedom crypto is central to Brian Armstrong’s vision. What does this truly mean in practice? It means giving individuals greater autonomy over their finances. Consider a few scenarios: An individual in a country experiencing hyperinflation can hold value in a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or a stablecoin, preserving their wealth better than holding the rapidly devaluing local currency. A freelancer working for international clients can receive payments quickly and cheaply using crypto, bypassing slow and expensive traditional cross-border transfer systems that often involve multiple intermediaries and fees. People living under authoritarian regimes or in areas with underdeveloped banking infrastructure can access financial services, store value, and transact without needing permission from a bank or government entity. This ability to transact, save, and invest without intermediaries or geographic limitations is the essence of the Economic freedom crypto promises. It empowers individuals and reduces reliance on potentially unstable or restrictive traditional financial systems. Addressing Crypto and Inflation Concerns One of the most discussed aspects of why the World needs crypto , according to Armstrong, is its role in combating inflation. The relationship between Crypto and inflation is complex, but the core idea is that assets with limited supply, like Bitcoin (capped at 21 million coins), are inherently deflationary or disinflationary by design, contrasting sharply with fiat currencies which can be printed indefinitely by central banks. While the crypto market is known for its volatility, many investors see assets like Bitcoin as a form of ‘digital gold’ – a store of value that holds its purchasing power over the long term, especially as traditional currencies lose value due to inflationary pressures. This perspective is gaining traction as global inflation persists. What Does This Mean for the Average Person? Brian Armstrong’s message isn’t just for economists or crypto enthusiasts. It has implications for everyone. As global debt rises and inflation eats away at savings, understanding alternatives becomes increasingly important. The crypto benefits discussed aren’t just theoretical; they offer practical ways for individuals to protect their wealth, participate in the global economy, and gain a degree of financial independence. Whether it’s exploring cryptocurrencies as a small part of a diversified savings strategy or using crypto for faster, cheaper international remittances, the opportunities presented by this technology are becoming harder to ignore in the current economic climate. Conclusion: Crypto’s Growing Role in a Challenging World Brian Armstrong’s statement serves as a potent reminder of the foundational problems that cryptocurrency was created to address. In a world grappling with mounting debt, persistent inflation, and concerns about economic freedom, the case for why the World needs crypto becomes compelling. The unique features of decentralization, permissionless access, and transparency offer tangible crypto benefits that can empower individuals and provide alternatives to traditional financial systems facing significant stress. As the global economic landscape continues to evolve, the role of Economic freedom crypto enables, and the potential of Crypto and inflation hedging will likely become even more significant, validating the perspective shared by the Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong .

2025-06-21T07:49:20,"Solana Price Analysis: Analysts Say SOL ETF Approval Is “Near-Lock” – What Does This Mean for the $200 Target?","Solana (SOL) is back in the spotlight as Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas now estimate a 90% chance of a Solana spot ETF being approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before year-end. According to their June 21 research note, the question is no longer “if,” but “when.” The momentum behind crypto ETFs has surged since Bitcoin and Ethereum funds made their debut on Wall Street. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust alone gathered over $70 billion in assets under management, faster than any ETF in history. NEW: @EricBalchunas & I are raising our odds for the vast majority of the spot crypto ETF filings to 90% or higher. Engagement from the SEC is a very positive sign in our opinion pic.twitter.com/5dh8G8rK6Y — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 20, 2025 With crypto legitimacy rising in D.C., the SEC has shown a willingness to engage with altcoin ETF filings, including updated S-1 forms from Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, and VanEck. Solana is seen as a frontrunner due to its market depth, developer traction, and now, staking-enabled ETF proposals. If approved, these ETFs wouldn’t just track SOL, they’d also stake held tokens, generating additional yield for investors. What a Solana ETF Could Mean for Price Institutional investors gaining direct access to Solana could dramatically shift market dynamics. According to Brian Rudick, Chief Strategy Officer at Solana-focused Upexi, top-tier altcoin ETFs, such as SOL, are likely to see strong inflows post-launch, similar to Bitcoin’s explosive run after its ETF debut. “Spot ETFs were the main reason Bitcoin more than doubled after BlackRock filed in mid-2023,” Rudick said. A comparable demand shock for Solana could ignite a similar rally. If history repeats itself, ETF-driven inflows could propel SOL toward the $200 mark, especially if market sentiment and macroeconomic tailwinds align. Analysts also point to the CFTC’s futures approval for SOL as another positive signal, which reinforces market maturity and regulatory openness toward the asset. Price Faces Technical Hurdles Before Breakout Despite ETF optimism, Solana’s short-term technicals remain bearish. At $140.40, SOL is struggling below the key resistance zone between $144.49 and $145.49, aligned with a descending trendline and the 50-period EMA. SOL is stuck below key resistance at $144.49–$145.49, with a bearish engulfing candle and MACD in the red. If $138.39 support breaks, eyes on $135.74 and $132.57 next. #Solana #Crypto #SOL #TechnicalAnalysis pic.twitter.com/UTWYK9JnOA — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) June 21, 2025 A bearish engulfing candle followed the last failed breakout attempt, sending the token into a consolidation phase just above support at $138.39. The MACD indicator remains in bearish territory, suggesting continued downside risk unless SOL reclaims the $145 zone. Should support at $138.39 give way, price could drop toward $135.74 or even $132.57. Solana Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Key Takeaways: Bloomberg pegs SOL ETF approval odds at 95% ETF issuers include Grayscale, Fidelity, VanEck Staking-enabled ETFs could boost investor yield SOL must break $145.49 to regain bullish momentum Downside levels to watch: $138.39, $135.74, $132.57 Outlook: ETF approval is a long-term catalyst ; however, for short-term Solana price prediction , traders should watch for a confirmed breakout above $145 to signal a bullish continuation. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.2M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers In addition to Solana, with BTC trading near $104K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,249,360 out of its $8,290,897 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.00257 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 58% APY staking pool holding over 1.81 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income. With just hours left and the hard cap nearly reached, momentum is building fast. BTCBULL ’s blend of Bitcoin-linked value, scarcity mechanics, and flexible staking is fueling strong demand. Early buyers have a limited time to enter before the next pricing tier activates.

2025-06-21T07:36:17,"Elon Musk Is Building a DEX on Twitter—What This Means for Crypto","The post Elon Musk Is Building a DEX on Twitter—What This Means for Crypto appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Elon Musk is making his boldest move yet in finance. The visionary billionaire behind Tesla and SpaceX is now transforming X —formerly Twitter—into a decentralized finance powerhouse. If successful, Musk could deliver the Western version of WeChat, combining social media, investing, payments, and crypto all in one app. X to Launch Its Own Decentralized Exchange (DEX) According to a recent post on X by crypto researcher Atlas , the platform is quietly developing into a full-fledged financial ecosystem. Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, confirmed that in-app investing, tipping, and payments are already in the pipeline. These features will be part of X Money , a new digital finance platform currently in limited beta testing, with a broader rollout expected in 2025. One major highlight? Visa is now an official partner of X’s upcoming DEX. Why Musk’s Super App Vision Could Be a Game-Changer Musk’s ultimate goal is to replicate WeChat’s super app model—but in the West. WeChat dominates in China by combining messaging, payments, e-commerce, and even government services into one platform. By integrating a decentralized exchange, Musk gives users: Full control over their funds Censorship resistance Lower transaction fees Enhanced financial privacy Other tech giants are taking note: Meta is exploring in-app payments TikTok is pushing into e-commerce Telegram has already launched P2P crypto trading and tipping But X’s existing scale and Musk’s crypto-friendly stance could give it a major first-mover advantage. Could X Disrupt Coinbase, Robinhood, and Revolut? Atlas warns that this move could shake up the entire fintech and crypto exchange landscape. With in-app trading of stablecoins , BTC, ETH, and tokenized assets, X could replace the need for separate apps like Coinbase, Robinhood, and Revolut. While centralized exchanges like Binance, Bybit, Coinbase, OKX, and Upbit still handle more than 85% of crypto spot volume, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are rapidly growing. Top DEXs by volume today include: PancakeSwap (v2 & v3) Uniswap v2 Raydium Curve Finance The Future of Finance Will Be Cultural, Not Technical Atlas emphasizes that mass adoption won’t come from whitepapers or technical jargon—it will come from entertainment, virality, and seamless finance integration. With X already a cultural hub, Musk may be the one to trigger the next wave of crypto adoption —not with a whitepaper, but with a viral tweet. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-21T07:27:05,"Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP Prices are Down Today?","The post Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP Prices are Down Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market today is feeling the weight of macroeconomic and geopolitical risks. Successively, the valuation of the industry has dropped to $3.2 trillion, with a 1.10% decline in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the 24-hour trading volume has surged over 42% to hit $114.74 billion, signaling heightened volatility and possibly panic-led sell-offs. Amidst the ruckus, the Fear & Greed Index has moved to 43, placing the market in the neutral zone. Rising tensions in the Middle East and uncertainties around the potential restoration of Trump-era trade policies are spooking both traditional and digital asset investors. Let’s take a closer look at how this is impacting Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction: Can It Hold Above $102k? Bitcoin price today is at $103,491, down 0.94% in the past 24 hours. The daily low sits at $102,372, suggesting that the price is hovering dangerously close to key support levels. The 38% uptick in 24-hour volume to $50.25B indicates aggressive intraday trading, but not necessarily bullish accumulation. If BTC fails to maintain support at $102,000, a further slide toward $100,000 or even $98,500 is highly likely. However, if the market finds temporary relief and BTC reclaims $105,000, a short-term recovery toward $107,000–$108,000 may be on the cards. Curious about BTC’s year-end target? Read our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction: $2,400 or $2,300 First? Ethereum is bearing the brunt of today’s drop, plunging 3.59% to $2,423.62. The altcoin has seen its daily trading volume crash by over 76%, now at $21.59 billion. With a daily low of $2,371, ETH is testing a crucial demand zone. If it breaks below $2,370, the next key support lies around $2,300, followed by $2,200. It is worth noting that to initiate a recovery, ETH must climb back above $2,500. That being said, a push beyond $2,570 could invalidate short-term bearish setups and open a route toward $2,650. Hodling ETH? Check out our Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 Now! XRP Price Prediction: Is a Drop Below $2 Next? XRP price has slipped 1.16% over the past 24 hours to trade at $2.12, with a low of $2.09. Despite the modest drop compared to ETH, the volume has surged 45.9% to $2.49 billion, which I believe, that larger holders are offloading positions. If bearish pressure intensifies, XRP may retest $2.00, a support that could give way to a drop toward $1.90. Contrarily, reclaiming $2.18 could spark a minor relief rally toward $2.30. Curious about XRP’s future returns? Read our Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 Now! FAQs Why is the Bitcoin price falling today? Bitcoin is reacting to macroeconomic uncertainty, including tensions in the Middle East and fears surrounding potential Trump-era policy rollbacks. Will Ethereum fall below $2,300? Given the sharp volume decline and price weakness, Ethereum could test the $2,300–$2,200 range if the bulls don’t step in soon. Is XRP expected to drop below $2? If current bearish momentum continues, XRP could slide below $2, targeting $1.90 as the next major support.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-ethereum-xrp-prices-going-low-today/,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare

2025-06-21T07:24:06,"This Altcoin-Related Company Could Sign a Major Deal with Reddit, One of the Largest Social Media Platforms","Reddit, one of the largest social media platforms in the world, may open a new page in its user verification processes. It has emerged that the company is considering using the eye-scan-based World ID system developed by Tools for Humanity, co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. This is also a system that is linked to the World (WLD) altcoin. The ongoing talks between Reddit and Tools for Humanity could pave the way for users on the platform to both remain anonymous and prove they are human, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The talks have gained momentum amid the rise of fake content generated by artificial intelligence online and the emergence of age-verification laws for social media in several countries. Related News: Two Companies Announce Bitcoin Purchase Strategy - Here's How Much They Plan to Buy Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said last month that due to AI-based threats and age verification regulations, the company will have to determine whether users are human and of a certain age. Huffman said that they will work with third-party providers to avoid collecting user data: “We will work to preserve both the humanity and anonymity of Reddit.” The World ID is created with unique biometric data obtained from a user’s iris. This data is fragmented and stored on secret servers in different parts of the world. The system allows users to prove that they are a unique individual without revealing their identity. The identity verification process is completed with a World ID stored encrypted on the user’s phone. As a reward, users are given WLD tokens. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-21T07:04:27,"16,000,000,000 Passwords Leaked in Historic Data Breach – Apple, Facebook and Google Users Affected: Report","Cybersecurity researchers have reportedly uncovered what is likely the biggest data breach in history, affecting billions of people who use Apple, Facebook, Google and other services. Since the beginning of the year, researchers at Cybernews have been thumbing through “supermassive datasets” that contain at least 16 billion records of login information for social media, VPNs, developer portals, corporate platforms and much more. The researchers say “no stone was left unturned.” “This is not just a leak – it’s a blueprint for mass exploitation. With over 16 billion login records exposed, cybercriminals now have unprecedented access to personal credentials that can be used for account takeover, identity theft, and highly targeted phishing. What’s especially concerning is the structure and recency of these datasets – these aren’t just old breaches being recycled. This is fresh, weaponizable intelligence at scale.” The experts say that some of the datasets were labeled with vague names like “logins” or “credentials,” not giving much of a hint as to what was inside the files. However, other datasets were more specific with their labeling. According to the researchers, one dataset’s name suggested it was linked to the Russian Federation and had over 455 million records inside. Another was named after Telegram, the encrypted messaging app. “The inclusion of both old and recent infostealer logs – often with tokens, cookies, and metadata – makes this data particularly dangerous for organizations lacking multi-factor authentication or credential hygiene practices,” Bob Diachenko, a cybersecurity researcher and a contributor to Cybernews, is responsible for the discovery. Diachenko clarified that there was “no centralized data breach” of the aforementioned tech companies. Rather, the information was likely extracted using infostealers and then leaked onto the dark web. Researcher Aras Nazarovas said that the discovery might be evidence that cybercriminals have abandoned their old techniques of stealing data, and moving onto more sophisticated methods. “The increased number of exposed infostealer datasets in the form of centralized, traditional databases, like the ones found by the Cybernews research team, may be a sign, that cybercriminals are actively shifting from previously popular alternatives such as Telegram groups, which were previously the go-to place for obtaining data collected by infostealer malware.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-21T06:40:24,"Governor Abbott signed House Bill 4488 to protect Bitcoin reserves.","Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed House Bill 4488, ensuring that state funds — including any Bitcoin Reserve held outside the state treasury — are shielded from being redirected into general revenue. This paves the way for Texas to formalize a strategic Bitcoin investment program . Still , Governor Abbott has yet to weigh in on SB21, a bill permitting state investment in cryptocurrencies with at least a market capitalization of $500 billion. So far, only Bitcoin meets the criteria. Texas Governor Abbott has yet to approve or reject the SB21 bill The House Bill 4488 protects the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, the Texas Advanced Nuclear Development Fund, and the Gulf Coast Protection Account. That means the funds will remain established or maintained as distinct entities within or outside the state treasury, as defined by their enabling laws. However, creating the state’s Bitcoin Reserve hinges on signing SB21 or a comparable bill. If the legislation is signed, then the fund would fall under the legal protections outlined in HB4488. SB21 was submitted to the governor on June 1, giving him until June 22 to sign or veto it. If he takes no action by then, the bill will automatically become law. New Hampshire and Arizona approved their Bitcoin Reserve bills New Hampshire , Arizona, and Texas are among the first states to approve state-level Bitcoin Reserves. Although several other states introduced similar bills in recent months, most failed to advance due to lawmakers’ reluctance over concerns of Bitcoin’s volatility and long-term viability as a reserve asset. Arizona’s Senate also recently passed HB 2324 in a 16-14 vote, a bill that could see the expansion of the state’s crypto infrastructure. The bill is now back in the House for a final decision. If passed, the bill would amend Arizona’s forfeiture laws to permit the state to treat abandoned digital assets as unclaimed property. Arizona’s House also passed Senate Bill 1025 (SB1025), which stipulated that seized funds could be invested in Bitcoin. However, Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed it. She wrote: The Arizona State Retirement System is one of the strongest in the nation because it makes sound and informed investments. Arizonans’ retirement funds are not the place for the state to try untested investments like virtual currencу. Governor Katie Hobbs Michigan also introduced four new pro-crypto bills. The first would permit the state’s retirement fund to hold Bitcoin, while the second bill targets CBDCs, calling for a statewide ban and enhanced financial privacy protections. The other two bills are centered on BTC mining, including benefits for those operating on abandoned oil and gas wells. New Hampshire passed HB 302 into law, allowing the state treasurer to purchase Bitcoin and other digital assets with a market cap above $500 billion. The state also maintains a 5% cap on Bitcoin and digital assets to ensure crypto remains complementary.

2025-06-21T06:30:34,"Consolidation Takes Its Toll: Bitcoin Investors No Longer Greedy","Data shows the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has returned back to the neutral territory, a sign that investors are losing optimism. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Has Reset Back To Neutral The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment present among the traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: Dogecoin Gears Up For 60% Move—Will It Be Up Or Down? The index makes use of the data of these five factors in order to determine the trader mentality: trading volume, market cap dominance, volatility, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. The indicator represents the calculated sentiment as a score lying between zero and hundred. Values above the 54 mark correspond to the dominance of greed in the market, while those below 46 to presence of fear among the investors. All values lying between these cutoffs correlate to a net neutral sentiment. Now, here is how the mood in the Bitcoin market is like right now according to the Fear & Greed Index: As is visible above, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has a value of 54 at the moment, which suggests the investors hold a neutral sentiment, although one that’s right on the edge of turning into greed. The recent neutral mentality in the sector has come following a phase of greed among the traders, as the below chart shows. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index spiked to a high of 72 earlier in the month as the asset’s price gave investors hope that its consolidation phase might be coming to an end. As the recovery rally has fizzled out and the coin has returned to its range, however, optimism among the investors has predictably faded. If history is to go by, though, this development may not actually be so bad for the cryptocurrency. Generally, digital asset markets tend to move in a way that goes contrary to the expectations of the majority. The probability of such an opposite move taking place goes up the more extreme the crowd opinion becomes. Besides the three core sentiments, there are two special regions known as the extreme fear (under 25) and extreme greed (above 75). These zones are where the likelihood of a contrary move has been the strongest in the past, with tops and bottoms often taking form. Although the market sentiment has recently only seen a reset to the neutral territory, the fact that the investors are no longer greedy could still be a positive for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. There have been many instances in the past where a dip into the neutral zone was enough for the bull run to regain momentum.

2025-06-21T06:30:15,"Solana and BTC Investors Are Placing Big Bets on MAGACOIN FINANCE","As June 2025 unfolds, investors from the Solana (SOL) and Bitcoin (BTC) communities are making bold moves by placing significant bets on MAGACOIN FINANCE. While XRP, Ethereum (ETH), TRON (TRX), and Sei (SEI) remain in the spotlight for their own developments, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as the top speculative play, drawing attention for its explosive upside potential and strategic positioning in the current market cycle. Powerhouse Performance: MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Early Investment Surge MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly establishing itself as a leading force in the altcoin pre-sale space, gaining momentum through exclusivity and growing investor enthusiasm. Its transparent token distribution, capped supply, and upcoming staking functionality are central to its long-term appeal. Backed by strong analyst sentiment, the project is positioned for compelling performance following its public launch. Project Highlights: Transparent and capped tokenomics Strategic bonuses supporting both community and institutional engagement, including a 100% bonus for larger contributors using PATRIOTS100X . Solana (SOL): Bullish Outlook and Institutional Interest Solana is trading near $149, with bullish analysts forecasting a surge to $380–$500 by year-end, driven by institutional adoption and DeFi/NFT growth. Despite past network outages, high transaction speeds and low fees keep SOL at the forefront. As Solana’s ecosystem expands, some investors are rotating profits into MAGACOIN FINANCE, seeking sharper early-stage returns. Bitcoin (BTC): Market Anchor and Sentiment Driver Bitcoin remains structurally sound, though recent price hesitancy and macroeconomic concerns have led to cautious sentiment. Still, BTC’s leadership continues to set the tone for the broader market. As BTC consolidates, many traders are diversifying into high-upside plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Awaiting Major Catalysts XRP is trading near $2.20–$2.31, with investors closely watching the June 16 Ripple lawsuit decision and ETF speculation. While whale accumulation signals long-term confidence, many are also hedging with MAGACOIN FINANCE for higher-multiple potential as regulatory clarity remains elusive. Ethereum (ETH): Bullish Momentum Builds ETH is trading around $2,690, up 8% daily, as the Pectra upgrade and institutional inflows fuel optimism. With resistance near $2,700–$2,900, some ETH holders are diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture early-stage momentum before the next leg up. TRON (TRX): Bullish Trend and Price Targets TRON is holding above $0.28, with June forecasts targeting $0.31 and a bullish outlook for 2025. As TRX maintains its uptrend, some traders are allocating to MAGACOIN FINANCE for its high-upside potential. Sei (SEI): Growth Forecasts for 2025 SEI is expected to show solid growth, with forecasts suggesting a rise to around €0.77 ($0.83) by December 2025. As SEI’s ecosystem expands, MAGACOIN FINANCE is also benefiting from renewed interest in innovative altcoins. Final Thoughts With Solana and Bitcoin investors leading the charge, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the breakout story of June 2025. As XRP, ETH, TRX, and SEI hold steady, the boldest upside may belong to those moving early on MAGACOIN FINANCE.

2025-06-21T06:00:14,"Why Bitcoin Whales Are Quietly Buying Into MAGACOIN FINANCE","While the broader crypto market digests June’s volatility, a new trend is emerging beneath the surface. Large Bitcoin holders — often known for their early positioning — are quietly rotating capital into MAGACOIN FINANCE. At the same time, more visible assets like Chainlink, Polkadot, Polygon, and Cardano are grappling with resistance levels and investor hesitation. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Quiet Moves, Clear Intent As legacy tokens fight to maintain momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction where it matters — among smart money. Bitcoin whales are steadily buying in, not for flash, but for fundamentals. With a hard supply cap of 170 billion tokens, staking already operational, and a fully audited smart contract via HashEx, this project offers a rare alignment of security, utility, and upside potential.This is the type of asset Bitcoin whales accumulate early — before it makes headlines. Why top investors are entering now: Capped Supply: No risk of inflation or stealth minting Staking Rewards: Passive income model already running Verified Code: Full audit completed for trust assurance Decentralized Control: No VC manipulation, all community-led On-Chain Patterns: Low churn, growing wallet concentration Bonus Active: PATRIOTS100X giving early entrants added leverage Chainlink (LINK) Eyes Continuation Above $16 Chainlink recently bounced back, surging to $15.30 and currently trading near $15.80–$16.50. The move came after strong integration news involving SWIFT and JPMorgan, pushing bullish forecasts toward $20–$25 if momentum sustains. Still, with LINK approaching key resistance, some short-term traders are locking in gains and reallocating to smaller-cap assets with higher near-term upside. Polkadot (DOT) Rises on Elastic Scaling Buzz Polkadot is testing the $4.40–$4.80 range following a 16% weekly gain, driven by anticipation around its June 2025 Elastic Scaling rollout. If DOT breaks above $5.00, analysts believe it could reach $8–$10 by year-end. For now, the token is showing strength but hasn’t fully confirmed a longer-term breakout, leading cautious capital to diversify elsewhere. Polygon (MATIC) Rebounds During PoS Transition Polygon is currently trading between $0.21 and $0.28 amid major structural changes, including the transition from MATIC to POL. With Polygon 2.0 and AggLayer v3.0 aiming for massive TPS boosts and better cross-chain liquidity, long-term interest remains strong. However, the short-term price has yet to reflect those changes, keeping speculative capital on standby. Cardano (ADA) Drifts Amid Governance Uncertainty Cardano is hovering around $0.63 following a 26% year-to-date decline. The treasury debate over reallocating 140 million ADA has caused unease within the community. While the Chang hard fork and Hydra upgrade offer long-term promise, ADA’s price action is subdued, and many traders are looking toward more active growth opportunities. Final Thoughts With Chainlink, Polkadot, Polygon, and Cardano navigating technical hurdles, the quiet accumulation of MAGACOIN FINANCE by large holders may signal where the next breakout truly begins.

Without this law, these funds might have been forced to be sold off in 2025. Now, they’re safe and won’t be treated like regular government money. This shows that Texas is serious about using and protecting cryptocurrency as part of its official financial plans. Update: Texas has passed a law securing off-treasury $BTC reserves, with a key decision on SB21 potentially allowing the state to buy #Bitcoin , set for June 22. #CoinPedia #CryptoNews #Blockchain #CryptoMarket pic.twitter.com/jS0eJluyH9 — Coinpedia (@CoinpediaNews) June 21, 2025 Bitcoin Investment Bill Awaits Abbott’s Decision While HB 4488 is now law, all eyes are on Senate Bill 21 (SB21) , which proposes allowing Texas to invest directly in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with market caps over $500 billion. At present, only Bitcoin qualifies, making it the prime candidate for state investment. Governor Abbott has until June 22 to sign or veto SB21. If he takes no action, the bill will become law automatically. SB21 would mark a major milestone in crypto adoption at the state level, aligning Texas with a growing number of institutions that view Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Institutional Momentum Builds Around Bitcoin Governor Abbott’s steps mirror a broader institutional trend. Hedge fund manager Eric Semler, who chairs healthcare firm Semler Scientific, has been vocal in his support of Bitcoin as a long-term investment . Semler’s firm recently increased its Bitcoin holdings, reinforcing the view that crypto is gaining ground as a store of value. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Crypto Market Is Down Today? $240B Wiped Out Amid Israel-Iran Tensions , His popular approach, investing in what most don’t, has paid off historically, especially in turbulent markets.

Texas is Sending a Message The passage of HB 4488 shows that Texas is serious about protecting its crypto reserves. If SB21 follows, the state could become one of the first to officially invest in Bitcoin. Together, these two bills reflect a calculated but forward-looking approach. For investors and institutions watching from the sidelines, Texas might be the place where crypto meets government policy and gets taken seriously. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

SB21 is highly likely to become law as Governor Abbott’s deadline is June 22, 2025, and inaction means automatic passage. It would enable Texas to directly invest in Bitcoin, creating a state-managed reserve. What are the potential risks of Texas holding Bitcoin as a strategic reserve outside traditional assets? Potential risks include Bitcoin’s high volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and cybersecurity threats. Critics also question whether government involvement in speculative assets aligns with prudent fiscal policy. Why is only Bitcoin currently qualifying for Texas’s proposed investment bill and could Ethereum join later? Only Bitcoin currently qualifies because SB21 requires a minimum 12-month average market capitalization of $500 billion. Ethereum could join later if its market cap consistently meets this threshold. What impact might Texas’s crypto policies have on institutional interest in Bitcoin? Texas’s proactive crypto policies could significantly boost institutional interest in Bitcoin by legitimizing it as a reserve asset, potentially encouraging other states and large entities to follow suit.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/texas-protects-its-bitcoin-holdings-with-new-law/,"ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Reserve",cryptocompare
2025-06-21T05:30:55,"Bitcoin ‘Rainbow Chart’ Signals Buying Opportunity, But Weak Demand Raises Concerns","According to a recent post on X by crypto analyst Crypto Rover, the Bitcoin (BTC) Rainbow Chart is flashing a buy signal, suggesting that the leading cryptocurrency may be on the cusp of a significant upward move. However, weak market demand could pose a risk to this bullish momentum. Bitcoin Rainbow Chart Flashes Buy Signal After hitting a new all-time high (ATH) on May 22, BTC has spent nearly a month consolidating between the $100,000 and $110,000 range, without showing a clear directional bias. Now, one of the most well-known indicators – the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart – is pointing toward potential upside for the top digital asset. Crypto Rover shared the following chart, showing BTC currently trading in the light green, or “buy”, zone of the Rainbow pattern. Historically, Bitcoin has often entered this zone shortly after each four-year halving, signalling potential growth ahead. For the uninitiated, the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart is a long-term valuation tool that uses a logarithmic growth curve with color bands to show where Bitcoin’s price stands relative to historical trends. Each color band suggests a different market sentiment, helping investors identify potential overvaluation or undervaluation zones. While the Rainbow Chart’s buy signal is promising, the broader demand for BTC appears lackluster. In a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post, contributor Darkfost pointed out that sluggish demand is limiting Bitcoin’s ability to break out. Darkfost shared the following chart, which compares new BTC supply to coins held inactive for over a year – used to gauge apparent demand. When the ratio moves above zero, it typically indicates strong market demand. Since the last local top in May, this apparent demand metric has been gradually declining, though it remains sufficient to absorb current selling pressure. In essence, while BTC is managing to stay above the $100,000 level, demand is fading – a potential headwind. However, some encouraging signs remain. In a separate X post, crypto trader Merlijn The Trader noted that the buy/sell pressure delta is showing an oversold signal, implying that short-term sellers could be nearing exhaustion . BTC Wyckoff Accumulation Nearing End? Crypto market commentator Ted Pillows added that BTC may be in the final stage of the Wyckoff Accumulation pattern. According to Ted, a decisive breakout above $110,000 could send Bitcoin surging to $130,000 “in no time.” Overall, Bitcoin continues to demonstrate a healthy technical structure, maintaining support at the $104,000 level. The market also saw notable deleveraging following yesterday’s US Federal Reserve meeting. That said, Bitcoin exchange activity is starting to show signs of fatigue, while retail investors continue to stay on the sidelines. At press time, BTC trades at $104,128, up 0.2% in the past 24 hours.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-rainbow-chart-signals-buying-opportunity-but-weak-demand-raises-concerns/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Apparent Demand|btc|BTCUSDT|buy/sell pressure delta|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|Rainbow Chart|wykcoff accumulation",cryptocompare
2025-06-21T05:01:45,"Why Crypto Market Is Down Today? $240B Wiped Out Amid Israel-Iran Tensions","The post Why Crypto Market Is Down Today? $240B Wiped Out Amid Israel-Iran Tensions appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market has been under immense pressure over the past week, primarily due to growing geopolitical risks. On June 21, the total cryptocurrency market dropped by 1.26% to $3.21 trillion, wiping out nearly $240 billion in value. Bitcoin led the fall, slipping to a low of $103,127, down 2% in just seven days. Altcoins were hit even harder—Ethereum dropped to $2,456, losing 10% during the same time. But what exactly is causing this crypto market crash? Let’s break down! Israel-Iran War & U.S. Involvement Fears The biggest trigger has been the rising conflict between Israel and Iran. Crypto investors are now worried that the U.S. might step into the war, as Trump has already warned Iran over not signing a deal. As a result, Bitcoin fell from $108,000 to $103,000 in a week, while Ethereum, Solana & Dogecoin also dropped over 10%. Whale Sell-Offs Taking Profits Whales are starting to sell huge amounts of Bitcoin and moving off altcoin on the exchange. According to Glassnode data , wallets that held BTC for 6–12 months sold over $900 million recently. Even those who’ve held Bitcoin for over a year have started cashing out. In early June, long-term holders took home $1.2 billion in profits, one of the biggest profit-taking waves this year. Massive Liquidations Add Pressure As prices dropped, many traders using leverage got wiped out. In the past 24 hours alone, over $503 million in crypto positions were liquidated, with 134,000 traders affected. Most of these losses happened on Ethereum, which saw $183 million in liquidations. The largest single loss was seen by a Bitcoin trade worth $8 million on the Bybit exchange. Altcoins Hit Harder Than Bitcoin While Bitcoin dropped about 2%, most altcoins dropped even more. Ethereum is down 10% for the week, Solana fell over 11%, and XRP lost 1.4%. The Altcoin Index has dropped to 22, showing Bitcoin is dominating the market. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In the past 24 hours, $503 million in crypto was liquidated. Bybit saw the most with $191.19 million, followed by Binance ($115.60 million) and Gate ($73.07 million). How much BTC, ETH, and XRP were liquidated in the past 24 hours? In the past 24 hours, over $503 million in crypto positions were liquidated overall. Specifically, Ethereum saw $183 million in liquidations, and XRP lost 1.4%. Bitcoin had a single $8 million liquidation. Is this crypto dip a buying opportunity or a signal to get out? This dip presents a complex situation. While historical patterns suggest Bitcoin often rebounds after geopolitical events, ongoing whale sell-offs and liquidations add risk, making careful research and risk assessment crucial for any investment decision. Will the market rebound quickly, or is this the start of a deeper correction? The market’s immediate future is uncertain. While some historical trends suggest a potential rebound after geopolitical shocks, the extent of whale selling and mass liquidations indicates that a deeper correction is possible if these pressures persist.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-crypto-market-is-down-today-240b-wiped-out-amid-israel-iran-tensions/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-21T05:00:58,"Bitcoin Sees Modest Gains, But Demand Weakness Limits Breakout Potential","Bitcoin has resumed a slow climb upward after a recent period of consolidation, briefly breaking back above the $106,000 mark earlier today. At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $105,383, reflecting a 0.8% increase over the past 24 hours. While this upward move has not sparked a major breakout, analysts are paying close attention to on-chain and market structure indicators that suggest a cautiously balanced environment. Related Reading: Analyst Warns Of Bitcoin Breakdown—’If This Continues, It Snaps’ On-Chain Data Points to Equilibrium, But Demand Wanes According to CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost, the market currently lacks extreme signals of profit-taking or panic. In a recent analysis, Darkfost explained that realized profits over a seven-day moving average remain below $1 billion. This is in line with figures observed during the market correction in late 2024 and significantly below peaks seen in early 2025. The analyst suggests that the current realized profit levels point to a market that is not under pressure from large-scale investor exits, supporting the ongoing consolidation. In the same report, Darkfost also discussed how a decline in demand may be limiting further upward momentum. By analyzing the ratio of new supply to the supply held inactive for over a year, the study observed that while demand remains positive, it has been weakening since Bitcoin’s local high in May. This suggests that although the market is absorbing existing selling pressure, fresh buying interest is not strong enough to trigger a new rally. As a result, the market appears to be in a state of temporary equilibrium, a phase where both sellers and buyers are relatively inactive. Bitcoin Traders Brace for Volatility in a Crowded Range Another CryptoQuant analyst, BorisVest, echoed the sentiment of a tightly contested market by analyzing Binance order flow and position data. He noted that Bitcoin has traded within a range of $100,000 to $110,000 for nearly a month. Within this band, both long and short positions have been building, and traders are watching the extremes of this zone closely. According to BorisVest, any breakout beyond $110,000 or drop below $100,000 could set the tone for the next significant price movement. The $100K–$110K price range has become a battleground for both bulls and bears. BorisVest observed that short positions are currently increasing, indicating that a significant portion of market participants expect a downward correction.

2025-06-21T03:58:54,"Semler Scientific Unveils Plan to Accumulate 105,000 BTC by 2027","Nasdaq-listed healthcare technology company, Semler Scientific, has outlined a bold multi-year plan to significantly expand its Bitcoin holdings. The company aims to hold 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025 as an initial milestone. Building on this, it plans to increase its holdings to 42,000 BTC by the end of 2026. By the close of 2027, Semler intends to reach a total of 105,000 BTC. Semler Reports 287% Bitcoin Yield to Date According to the official press release, the company said it will fund these purchases using a mix of equity and debt financing, as well as operational cash flows. Semler, which in May 2024 became the second US public company to adopt Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset, has since emerged as a significant corporate Bitcoin holder. As of June 3, 2025, the firm reported a 287% yield on its Bitcoin investment and a $177 million unrealized gain. In a move to strengthen its new approach, Semler has appointed Joe Burnett as Director of Bitcoin Strategy. Burnett, formerly Director of Market Research at Unchained, brings more than seven years of experience in Bitcoin advocacy and research. In a statement, Eric Semler, chairman of Semler Scientific, said, “We are excited to have Joe join our Bitcoin strategy team and help drive our three-year-plan to own 105,000 Bitcoins. Joe is an analytical thought leader on Bitcoin and Bitcoin treasury companies. His expertise will be instrumental as we pursue our Bitcoin treasury strategy and aim to deliver long-term value to our stockholders.” Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Grow An increasing number of public companies are deepening their involvement with the largest cryptocurrency. For instance, Genius Group, an AI-driven education company, recently increased its corporate Bitcoin reserves from 66 BTC to 100 BTC, after acquiring an additional 34 BTC valued at approximately $3.42 million. The company resumed its Bitcoin purchases on May 22, following a May 6 US Court of Appeals ruling that lifted previous legal restrictions stemming from a dispute related to its merger with FatBrain AI. CEO Roger Hamilton described reaching 100 BTC as a milestone in their broader plan to accumulate 1,000 BTC. Earlier this month, New York-based Mercurity Fintech Holding announced it would raise $800 million to build a Bitcoin treasury reserve. The company plans to integrate staking and tokenized finance tools, using secure blockchain custody infrastructure to reshape its treasury operations and boost capital efficiency through yield generation.

2025-06-21T03:30:19,"Bitcoin May Surprise Bears: $100K–$110K Range Shows Rising Short Interest","While Bitcoin (BTC) has remained range-bound – trading between $100,000 and $110,000 for about a month – both short and long positions have been building within this range, with short positions rising at a faster pace. Bitcoin Long Positions Slightly Ahead But Shorts Catching Up After reaching a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,814 last month, BTC has consolidated within the $100,000–$110,000 range for nearly a month, offering little clarity on its next directional move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Strong Despite Israel-Iran Tensions – Weekly Resistance Begins To Crack According to a new CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor BorisVest, fresh data from Binance crypto exchange suggests that long positions currently hold a slight edge in this range. Historical data reveals a pattern – when short positions rise, short squeezes tend to follow. Similarly, a buildup in long positions has often led to long squeezes. A decisive breakout from either end of the current range will likely determine Bitcoin’s next major move. That said, Binance data indicates that while long positions are marginally ahead, the ratio of longs to shorts remains relatively balanced. The funding rate hovering near neutral levels supports this view, reflecting a closely contested standoff between bulls and bears. However, such balance usually signals uncertainty in the market. While long interest has stabilized, short positions continue to climb – likely driven by expectations of further downside amid escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. BorisVest noted: This shows that most market participants believe the rally may not continue. When Bitcoin’s price starts to fall, and funding rates turn negative, it means shorts are piling in quickly. All of this points to this range being a highly sensitive zone. He further noted that with most traders leaning toward short positions, the setup could be ripe for a surprise move in the opposite direction – possibly fuelled by quiet accumulation from larger market participants. Is BTC Preparing For A Big Move? Despite BTC trading within the $100,000 – $110,000 range for the better part of the previous month, several analysts posit that the flagship cryptocurrency is preparing for a major move in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates as Realized Profits Stay Low – No Signs Of Major Sell-Off Yet Most analysts are leaning toward a move to the upside. For instance, crypto trader Josh Olszewics remarked that if liquidity holds, then BTC may eye a move toward the $150,000 level. From a technical standpoint, the outlook is encouraging. Crypto analyst Mister Crypto recently pointed out that BTC is forming a bullish inverse head & shoulders pattern on the 3-day chart. However, latest on-chain data shows that Bitcoin Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Golden Cross recently moved into an overpriced zone, warranting caution.

With the altcoin market heating up and investors seeking the next big winner, tokens like Polkadot (DOT), Kaspa (KAS), and Aptos (APT) remain in focus—but it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that’s capturing the most attention for its early-stage momentum and breakout potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Frontrunner in 2025’s Crypto Presale Landscape MAGACOIN FINANCE has swiftly established itself as a frontrunner in the 2025 crypto presale landscape, raising over $10 million in a matter of weeks. The project’s official website offers limited access, with a bonus of 100% on investments using PATRIOTS100X. Its innovative staking platform and capped supply are appealing to both retail and institutional investors. Its contracts have been verified by HashEx, one of the most trusted names in smart contract auditing. The unique blend of meme appeal and utility is expected to drive continued growth. Solana (SOL): Bullish Structure and Institutional Support Solana is trading between $150 and $195, with analysts eyeing a breakout above $165 as a trigger for further gains. Institutional interest and ecosystem expansion continue to fuel optimism, and as SOL consolidates, many traders are allocating profits into MAGACOIN FINANCE for higher-upside exposure. Polkadot (DOT): Consistent Growth, Steady Outlook Polkadot is forecasted to trade between $3.67 and $3.68 in June, with longer-term projections pointing to steady but moderate gains. As DOT’s growth moderates, investors seeking sharper returns are increasingly looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE. Kaspa (KAS): Range-Bound but on Watchlists Kaspa is trading near $0.08, with technicals suggesting a range-bound summer. While KAS offers stability, it lacks the explosive upside now drawing capital to MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale. Aptos (APT): Bullish Forecasts and Ecosystem Growth Aptos is projected to trade between $4.44 and $4.48 in June, with bullish sentiment for 2025 as the ecosystem expands. As APT builds, some holders are diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture early-stage gains. Final Thoughts With XRP, Solana, and Bitcoin followers all zoning in, MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting the pace for June 2025’s altcoin market. As DOT, KAS, and APT hold steady, the boldest opportunities may belong to those who move early on MAGACOIN FINANCE.

Trading has thinned out this week, and Dogecoin has slipped almost 3% over the past seven days. Based on reports, investors are moving carefully as volume dropped 30% to about $678 million. Related Reading: Iran’s Top Crypto Hub Loses $82 Million To Hackers With Israeli Links—Details Trading Volume Drop Signals Caution According to on‑chain data, the slump in daily volume shows fewer traders are stepping in. That 34% slide in activity suggests a loss of momentum. Some market watchers say low volume often leads to whipsaws. When fewer coins change hands, even modest buys or sells can push prices sharply in either direction. #Dogecoin $DOGE looks prime for a 60% price move!

Prices have carved lower highs and higher lows as trendlines converge. Data from crypto analyst Ali shows, this narrowing range often precedes a major move. He notes the tip of the triangle is due by June 2025, which puts a deadline on when volatility should pick up. DOGE Bulls Eye Breakout According to Ali’s analysis, a daily close above $0.22 likely signals a bullish breakout. If that happens, he sees Dogecoin reaching roughly $0.35 or $0.36—about 60% higher than current levels. On the flip side, a drop below $0.16 could spark a sell‑off toward $0.10. Investors are watching those exact levels to decide whether to join buyers or cut losses. DOGE Price Forecast Digital Coin Price is on the optimistic end. They predict Dogecoin could go past $0.37 before year‑end and even test its old high of $0.74 again. Market Catalysts Could Tip The Scales Dogecoin’s swings often mirror the wider crypto space or follow social media buzz. A surge in Bitcoin or Ethereum prices could carry DOGE higher, while a broader sell‑off would magnify losses. Some traders also keep an eye on endorsements from well‑known figures and major exchange listings. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears Climax, But A Twist Awaits—Analyst Reveals Key Insight For now, patience may pay off. Traders will look for volume to confirm any move past $0.22 or under $0.16.

If volume steps back in, Dogecoin could pick a clear direction—either a strong rally or a deeper correction.

2025-06-21T01:30:18,"MAGACOIN FINANCE Joins Bitcoin and Solana in Top 2025 Bullish Picks","The 2025 crypto bull run is in full swing, and a new wave of top picks is emerging as investors look beyond the usual giants. Bitcoin (BTC) continues to set the pace with record institutional inflows, while Solana (SOL) is drawing bullish forecasts from experts. Now, MAGACOIN FINANCE is joining this elite group, rapidly gaining traction as one of the most promising altcoins for the year. With Cardano (ADA), NEAR Protocol (NEAR), Kaspa (KAS), and Arbitrum (ARB) also in focus, the market is primed for dynamic moves. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Setting New Standards for Altcoin Launches MAGACOIN FINANCE is making waves in 2025 after raising over $10 million in its limited-access pre-sale. With a capped supply, bold branding, and a full audit by HashEx, the project is gaining serious traction. Investors can double their holdings using promo code PATRIOTS100X—analysts expect major upside ahead of its public launch. Momentum is building fast across social platforms, with growing interest from both retail and early-stage backers. Many now view MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the year’s most compelling altcoin opportunities. Bitcoin (BTC): Institutional Inflows and New Highs Bitcoin is riding a wave of institutional adoption and record spot ETF inflows, with leading analysts forecasting a 2025 top between $180,000 and $250,000. As BTC continues to break new ground, it remains the market’s anchor and a key benchmark for bullish sentiment. Solana (SOL): Bullish Patterns and Expert Forecasts Solana is working on a bullish cup and handle pattern, with seven reputable experts predicting 2025 highs ranging from $220 to $1,000 and an average target of $515. Ecosystem expansion and the potential for ETF approval are driving optimism, keeping SOL among the top bullish picks. Cardano (ADA): DeFi Growth and Layer-2 Upgrades Cardano is forecasted to reach as high as $5.66 in 2025, supported by DeFi adoption, scaling solutions like Hydra, and growing institutional interest. ADA’s innovative approach and network upgrades are drawing attention from both retail and professional investors. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): Steady Growth Outlook NEAR Protocol is projected to reach $2.91 by the end of 2025, with a cumulative ROI of +18% and a long-term outlook for continued ecosystem development. As NEAR’s fundamentals strengthen, it remains a steady pick for diversified portfolios. Kaspa (KAS): Volatility and High Potential Kaspa’s price could range from $0.08 to $0.65 in 2025, with some analysts predicting up to 620% gains if bullish momentum holds. Its unique consensus mechanism and growing adoption keep KAS on the radar for high-risk, high-reward traders. Arbitrum (ARB): Layer-2 Leadership Arbitrum continues to lead Layer-2 solutions for Ethereum, with ongoing upgrades and ecosystem growth supporting its long-term value proposition. As ARB’s adoption expands, it remains a favorite among DeFi-focused investors.

2025-06-21T01:19:43,"XRP Price Prediction: Analyst Declares ‘Only Two Paths Remain’ as XRP Tightens to Breaking Point","The XRP price has inched up to $2.17 today , with this consolidation happening as the crypto market loses 1.5% in the past 24 hours. The altcoin is now up by 1.5% in a week but down by 8% in a month, following weeks of escalating tension in the Middle East and little progress with regards to international tariffs. That said, XRP retains a strong 335% increase in the past year, while analysts are beginning to suggest that the coin nearing a pivotal tipping point. This could be in either direction, however, although XRP’s fundamentals have become increasingly strong in recent weeks, pointing to a very positive long-term price prediction . XRP Price Prediction: Analyst Declares ‘Only Two Paths Remain’ as XRP Tightens to Breaking Point Posting on X, analyst CasiTrades wrote that XRP’s “consolidation has finally reached its apex and something big is coming next.” Unfortunately, she suggested that a big dive is more or less as likely as a breakout, so traders may need to tread very carefully in deciding whether to buy or sell. The market is officially out of time! After months of tightening, the #XRP consolidation has finally reached its apex and something big is coming next. There are only two paths from here: either the explosive breakout we've been waiting for begins now, or we see one final… pic.twitter.com/xGRyaevRxX — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) June 18, 2025 The main point of her analysis was that, if XRP struggles to break through $2.25 for much longer, it could slide to lower levels, to $2.00 or “even $1.55.” However, she may have invalidated her analysis to some degree by suggesting, a reply to her own post , that to “be clear, I do think we’ll get that drop to support today or tomorrow.” This did not happen, with the XRP price hanging around the same $2.15 level it had on the day (Wednesday) she made these predictions. If we look at XRP’s chart today, we see that the coin’s resistance (red) and support (green) are indeed converging to a point where a big move may arrive. As for the other indicators, they suggest that the altcoin remains in an oversold position, which would imply a strong rebound. Source: TradingView Its RSI (purple) has been below 50 for much of the time since February, while its moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is also in an oversold space. So given that XRP remains one of the strongest coins in the market in terms of fundamentals, it should pick up again strongly soon, assuming that t he Israel-Iran conflict doesn’t escalate further . With listed firms buying up XRP , with XRP ETFs on the way, and with Ripple expanding its business , the XRP price could easily reach $2.50 by the end of July and $3 by September. Bitcoin Hyper Gains Momentum with $1.4 Million Presale: Next 100x Coin? XRP continues to be a very strong altcoin, but traders should always consider diversifying into newer tokens, allocating a small percentage of their portfolios to coins that may show strong volatility. This should include presale tokens, which can often rally big when they list for the first time, especially if they’ve had successful raises. And one sale gaining steam right now belongs to Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), an Ethereum- and Solana-based tokensed that has raised just over $1.4 million in its ICO. Bitcoin Hyper is quickly gaining momentum because of its exciting plans to launch a layer-two network for Bitcoin, providing the latter with a big boost in speed and scalability. It will make use of zero-knowledge proofs to provide greater efficiency and security, while it will also harness Ethereum and Solana virtual machines to achieve its greater throughput. On top of this, it’s planning to provide a platform for DEXes and DeFi applications, so that a thriving DeFi ecosystem can build on top of the Bitcoin base layer. Its native token HYPER will be necessary to pay for transactions, meaning that demand for the token will grow in step with the platform’s growth. Holders will also be able to stake it for a passive income, with investors able to buy it now by going to the Bitcoin Hyper website . It’s currently selling for $0.01195, although this will rise again later today.

2025-06-21T01:00:26,"Analyst Warns Of XRP Trap — „You’re Being Played”","CryptoInsightUK’s latest market briefing arrives with the sound of literal hammer blows next door, an accidental soundtrack to the pounding he expects traders to take before the next rally. In a thirteen–minute walkthrough of XRP, Bitcoin and Ethereum liquidity maps, the British analyst argues that the market is staging what he calls “a deliberate trap” designed to flush out weak hands, harvest stop-loss orders and maximise upside leverage for larger players—leaving retail participants “screaming, ‘Yay, we’re going to the upside,’ … only to find out they’ve been played.” The Trap Is Set, Warns XRP Trader He begins with XRP’s five-month down-channel that started at the New-Year peak, noting that price continues to hug the underside of a descending trend line. “We’re stuck below that trend line basically looking to see if this liquidity is going to get taken below us. My obvious opinion is that it is,” he says, underscoring the conviction that a sweep of resting bids below remains the path of least resistance. The flush, he contends, would “make our journey to the upside much better and much easier to navigate,” because it would reset funding, scare out late longs and reload the order book for what he still calls the next “parabolic expansion probably up towards the $8 to $12 region.” Related Reading: ‘Out of Time’: XRP Consolidation Hits Final Moment, Analyst Alerts The trap, however, may not be a straightforward vertical collapse. Charts, he reminds viewers, “love doing something like” an initial breakout that rallies 15-20%, convinces traders the bear-phase is finished, and then abruptly reverses into the deep liquidity pocket below. “That’s exactly how higher-highs-and-higher-lows type situations are supposed to get you frustrated,” he says, openly conceding that the pattern looks engineered. The phrase he never uses—manipulation—hovers unspoken over the analysis, but his rhetoric leaves little doubt: “This is how they test everybody.” Bitcoin, in his narrative, may serve as the decoy that sets the trap. The benchmark asset has already slipped out of its own wedge-like consolidation and, he observes, “does like to do this sort of thing” by staging premature upside breaks. He sketches a possible march toward $115,000 that would “delay the inevitable” and then give way to a liquidity hunt of its own. Even so, his mid-cycle price band for Bitcoin remains $150,000 to $220,000. That upside, he argues, justifies dollar-cost-averaging into altcoins even while keeping “a tiny bit of dry powder” in reserve for the washout he expects. Related Reading: XRP 5-Wave Count Shows When The Price Will Hit All-Time Highs Above $5 A more elaborate scenario involves a temporary dominance surge in Bitcoin to the 66 to 74% range. As Bitcoin siphons capital, alts such as XRP would “bleed out,” take the downside liquidity target, and only then reverse as cash rotates back into their order books. He illustrates the dance on twin TradingView panels—Bitcoin on the left, XRP on the right—before concluding that the rotational setup is “not highly likely” because it requires several macro-scale dominoes to fall in sequence. Still, he refuses to dismiss it, pointing to the strategic reserve bill in Washington as the sort of narrative catalyst that could spark a temporary Bitcoin-only rally and demoralise alt-holders. Macro-risk flickers through the commentary—wars that could “shove us down” in the near term—but he treats geopolitical stress as a catalyst for final capitulation rather than a thesis-killer. “The upside is so large it almost can’t be ignored,” he insists, framing the present chop as a high-volatility pause before a structural up-leg. Whether that leg begins only after a full flush or emerges from yet another fake-out remains uncertain, but the analyst’s message is unmistakable: traders who chase breakouts without accounting for hidden hands risk being liquidated first, spectators to the parabola they hoped to ride. For now he is content to wait “for the market to do its worst trick,” believing that the final shakeout will announce itself through a sudden, depth-piercing wick. “You’re being played,” he warns. The admonition is stark: if the playbook unfolds as expected, the pain will be quick. “If we get these levels, that’s where I’m putting the last bit of my dry powder in. It’s $1.80-ish, $1.90 maybe.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.16.

2025-06-21T01:00:17,"Bitcoin Takes a Breather While MAGACOIN FINANCE and Solana Shine Brighter","Intro: Market Rotations Put New Altcoins in Focus As Bitcoin steadies after a high-volatility run, traders are beginning to reallocate their attention — and capital — into newer, higher-potential altcoins. While legacy assets like XRP, Cardano, TRON, and Litecoin maintain their positions, it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE and Solana that are emerging as leaders in this new wave of market momentum. Bitcoin (BTC) Cools After Recent Rally Bitcoin has taken a step back this week, consolidating after weeks of bullish action. Without a strong macroeconomic catalyst or breakout headline, BTC appears to be in a pause phase. Many investors are holding long-term, but traders looking for faster ROI are rotating out of Bitcoin and into assets showing more immediate traction and structural benefits. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Where Smart Traders Are Moving Now While older assets tread water, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining strong traction — and doing so with substance behind the hype. Here’s why it’s drawing capital quickly: 170B Fixed Supply: No future dilution or inflation. Staking Is Live: Traders can lock in passive rewards while holding. HashEx-Audited: The project has cleared a full security audit. No VC Control: Community-driven, with zero centralized ownership traps. On-Chain Strength: Wallet growth and long-hold behaviors continue to rise. Bonus Offer Active: The PATRIOTS100X bonus gives early buyers extra leverage before listings arrive. As the broader market steadies, MAGACOIN FINANCE is proving it has more than potential — it has the behavior, structure, and timing that typically precede breakout runs. Solana (SOL) Sustains Ecosystem Leadership Solana continues to rank among the most active blockchains by daily transactions and user activity. Its thriving ecosystem across NFTs, gaming, and decentralized apps has helped it remain relevant even in market lulls. While SOL hasn’t posted a dramatic price jump recently, its steady technical strength keeps it high on the list for altcoin exposure. XRP Eyes Resolution But Moves Cautiously XRP is still waiting on regulatory clarity, with the joint motion to release $125 million from escrow signaling that the SEC case may soon reach its conclusion. While this has sparked optimism, traders remain cautious due to the token’s sensitivity to legal headlines. The potential for an ETF or integration with SWIFT remains, but timing remains uncertain, prompting some capital outflow into earlier-stage coins. Cardano (ADA) Faces Community Confidence, Price Hesitation Cardano continues to build through its developer community, with founder Charles Hoskinson maintaining visibility. Still, ADA’s price remains closely tied to the overall market and has not generated its own breakout narrative in this cycle. It remains a long-term favorite, but in the short term, its momentum is flat, causing some traders to explore alternatives. TRON (TRX) Keeps Stability But Lacks Excitement TRON remains a strong network for stablecoins and high-frequency transactions, and Justin Sun continues to push updates and global partnerships. However, TRX hasn’t seen much volatility or growth this month. It is viewed as a stable layer, but traders looking for explosive upside are rotating to assets with more dynamic incentive models. Litecoin (LTC) Struggles for Relevance Litecoin has historically been called the silver to Bitcoin’s gold, but recent market activity has left LTC in the background. Without new technical developments or major ecosystem updates, it’s seen largely as a legacy hold — not a growth vehicle — and traders are beginning to overlook it during active rotation cycles. Final Thoughts Bitcoin is taking a well-earned pause, and while Solana maintains strong traction, it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that is turning heads for those chasing early-entry upside. Meanwhile, XRP, Cardano, TRON, and Litecoin continue to hold their lanes — but lack the same urgency or structure that’s driving attention toward this new contender.
