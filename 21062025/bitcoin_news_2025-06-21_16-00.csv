According to one prominent voice in the financial world, the answer is a resounding yes, with potentially significant implications for the duration of the current crypto bull run . This analysis suggests that the exciting upward trajectory we’ve seen might just be getting started, potentially pushing the peak much further out than many initially anticipated. Is This Crypto Market Cycle Different? Raoul Pal Weighs In Raoul Pal, the CEO of Real Vision and a respected figure known for his macroeconomics expertise applied to crypto, recently shared his insights in a video. His core message? The current crypto market cycle bears a “spookily similar” resemblance to the now-legendary 2017 bull run. This comparison isn’t made lightly; 2017 was a period of explosive growth that captured global attention and brought Bitcoin and altcoins into the mainstream consciousness. Pal’s observation isn’t just based on price action, though chart patterns can offer clues. His analysis delves deeper, incorporating macroeconomic factors that he believes are influencing the market’s behavior and potentially extending its timeline. Understanding these underlying forces is crucial for anyone trying to navigate the complexities of digital asset markets. Why Raoul Pal Predicts a Longer Crypto Prediction Timeline One of the key reasons behind Raoul Pal’s extended crypto prediction is his proprietary business cycle score. This metric, which assesses the health and phase of the global economy, currently sits below 50. According to Pal, when this score is low, it typically takes a considerable amount of time for it to rise significantly. This slow ascent of the business cycle score suggests that the broader economic environment remains conducive to risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies for a longer period than in typical cycles. Think of it like this: traditional market cycles often follow predictable patterns tied to economic expansion and contraction. However, if the economic engine is running slower than usual (as indicated by a low business cycle score), the associated market phases, including the crypto bull market, might also unfold over a more extended timeframe. This is a critical piece of Pal’s thesis, moving beyond simple chart analysis to ground his prediction in fundamental economic conditions. The Weakening Dollar and Its Impact on the Crypto Bull Run Another significant factor cited by Raoul Pal is the weakening U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar’s strength or weakness often has an inverse relationship with risk assets, including commodities, emerging markets, and cryptocurrencies. When the dollar weakens, it can make dollar-denominated assets relatively less attractive and push investors towards alternatives that are perceived to hold value or offer growth potential. Here’s a simplified look at why a weakening dollar can fuel the crypto bull run : Increased Liquidity: A weaker dollar often coincides with looser monetary policy or a shift away from dollar hoarding, potentially freeing up capital to flow into other markets. Inflation Hedge Narrative: While debated, many view Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as potential hedges against the devaluation of fiat currencies like the dollar. A weakening dollar can strengthen this narrative. Global Investor Behavior: For international investors holding other currencies, a weaker dollar makes buying dollar-denominated assets (like many major cryptocurrencies traded against USD pairs) relatively cheaper. Pal believes this ongoing trend of dollar weakness is a powerful tailwind that could provide sustained momentum for the crypto market, contributing significantly to the potential extension of the current cycle. Looking Ahead: Why 2026 Crypto Predictions Are Gaining Traction Combining the slow grind of the business cycle and the supportive environment created by a weakening dollar leads Raoul Pal to his specific timeline: an extension of the bull market into the second quarter (Q2) of 2026 crypto . This is a notable prediction, as many previous analyses based on historical Bitcoin halving cycles might have anticipated a peak sometime in late 2024 or 2025. Pal’s analysis suggests that focusing solely on the halving event might be too narrow a view in the current unique macroeconomic climate. The confluence of a low business cycle score and dollar weakness provides a different lens, suggesting that the typical post-halving rally could have a longer fuse this time around. This doesn’t invalidate the halving’s importance but posits that external macro factors are playing an unusually dominant role in shaping the duration of this particular crypto market cycle . Actionable Insights Based on This Extended Forecast: Longer-Term Perspective: If Pal is correct, investors might have more time to accumulate or hold positions, shifting focus away from trying to time a near-term peak. Risk Management Remains Key: While the potential upside period is extended, market volatility is inherent in crypto. Don’t mistake an extended cycle prediction for a guarantee of continuous upward movement without pullbacks. Diversification: An extended bull run could see various altcoins perform strongly. Researching projects beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum might be beneficial, but always understand the risks. Stay Informed on Macro: Pal’s analysis highlights the importance of macroeconomics. Keeping an eye on indicators like the U.S. dollar index and global economic health can provide valuable context. It’s important to remember that this is one analyst’s perspective, albeit a highly respected one. The crypto market is influenced by a multitude of factors, and predictions are never guaranteed. However, Pal’s framework offers a compelling argument for why this cycle might not follow the exact pattern of its predecessors. Conclusion: Navigating the Potential Extended Crypto Bull Run Raoul Pal’s analysis, drawing parallels to 2017 and incorporating macroeconomic signals like a low business cycle score and a weakening dollar, presents a compelling case for an extended crypto bull run potentially reaching into Q2 2026 crypto . While historical cycles offer valuable insights, the current global economic landscape appears to be introducing new variables that could stretch the timeline significantly. This outlook suggests that the opportunities within the crypto market cycle might not be expiring as quickly as some models predict. However, it also underscores the importance of understanding the macro forces at play and approaching the market with a long-term perspective and robust risk management strategy. Whether this prediction plays out precisely remains to be seen, but it certainly provides a thought-provoking framework for considering the potential duration and dynamics of the current market phase.

2025-06-21T13:46:28,"Bitcoin is ‘supporting the dollar rather than acting as a hedge’ – Binance report","Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) ability to serve as a hedge against the U.S. dollar is becoming less certain, with data indicating the crypto ‘s movement is aligning with the currency. Specifically, Bitcoin’s correlation with the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has surged to 0.25, the highest among major macro assets, marking an increase from May’s 0.15, according to a June 20 report by Binance Research shared with Finbold. Bitcoin correlation with other assets chart. Source: Binance Research Historically, the maiden digital currency has moved opposite to the dollar or remained unaffected. “This rare shift suggests that BTC may currently be reacting to the same liquidity conditions supporting the dollar rather than acting as a hedge against it,” the report noted. Bitcoin’s correlation with macro assets The report also revealed a 0.33 correlation between Bitcoin and 10-year Treasury yields, indicating the cryptocurrency’s potential as an inflation hedge. On the other hand, BTC’s relation with the S&P 500 has dropped to 0.21, signaling a move away from its earlier equity-like trading pattern. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s link to gold remains mildly negative at -0.11. While the precious metal tends to respond to traditional risk sentiment and interest rates, Bitcoin is more influenced by liquidity and speculative flows. “This behaviour suggests that, despite overlapping narratives, Bitcoin and gold have been absorbing macro flows differently — likely driven by Bitcoin’s higher volatility, more speculative positioning, and greater sensitivity to liquidity shifts,” the report stated. Notably, in 2025, as economic uncertainty grew mostly from trade tariffs, gold has rallied as a safe haven, while Bitcoin mostly held firm above the $100,000 mark. Bitcoin price analysis The Binance findings come as Bitcoin faces short-term volatility mainly from geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Before the escalation, Bitcoin nearly reached $110,000 but has since retraced. By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $103,897, down almost 2% in the last 24 hours and over 3% for the week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Despite the recent price drop, Binance pointed out that demand for the asset remains strong, especially when considering spot BTC exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ). To this end, these products have seen $2.4 billion in net inflows over eight days through June 18, indicating that long-term investors continue to buy the dip.

2025-06-21T13:46:09,"Bitcoin in Cool-Off Mode, Analysts Say Cycle May Stretch Into 2026","The post Bitcoin in Cool-Off Mode, Analysts Say Cycle May Stretch Into 2026 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is hovering near $103,700. There is growing uncertainty in its price action as global tensions rise. Retail sentiment is also weakening, adding to the pressure on BTC. But the current dip may just be a cool-off phase, and not the end of the bull cycle. Retail Sentiment Hits April Lows Crypto analytics firm Santiment shared recently that the retail sentiment has turned sharply negative, hitting its lowest point since early April. This is similar to levels seen in April, just before Bitcoin rebounded. With bearish comments rising, the panic could signal a rebound. The Fed rates are also steady, which has kept BTC stuck between $100K and $ 110 K. On-chain data shows that whales are accumulating while traders pull back. A Healthy Cool-Off Phase? The crypto market is currently in a slow correction phase. Altcoins have been declining since December, while Bitcoin remains stuck between $100K and $ 107K. Ethereum is struggling below $3,000, and overall trading volume is dropping, which are clear signs that retail investors are staying out for now. However, there have been no major crashes or negative events. This is a typical cooling-off period within a larger uptrend, similar to what happened in 2017 and 2021. These phases often follow major rallies and can last a few months. Looking ahead, there is a positive macro signal too. The Fed may cut rates in September, with a 71.8% chance according to CME FedWatch. This could boost crypto markets, and even the anticipation of rate cuts can lift sentiment and bring life back to risk assets. Cycle May Extend Into 2026 Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal also believes that the current crypto market closely resembles 2017, when Bitcoin rose steadily before exploding in December. He notes that macro conditions indicate that this cycle could be longer than expected, possibly extending into Q2 2026. Many long traders were recently wiped out on Binance as open interest dropped. This “cleanup” happened right after the Fed paused rate hikes. With fewer traders now in risky positions and past trends showing Bitcoin often rises after such events, CryptoQuant analysts see this as a potential setup for a Bitcoin bounce.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/james-wynn-predicts-bitcoin-crash-adds-70m-to-short-position/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BNB","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news",cryptocompare

2025-06-21T13:40:50,"Circle employees deal with $3B loss despite aggressive CRCL 700% surge","Circle employees are grappling with a staggering $3 billion loss, even as the stock has soared 700% since its IPO earlier this month. The loss is tied to the 14.4 million shares employees were required to sell during the offering to facilitate the public listing. Billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya confirmed: In order to get the IPO off, the team at Circle had to sell 14.4M shares at the IPO price of $31 for total proceeds of $ 446 M. These shares were ‘bought’ by the IPO bank and then sold to their best clients. Chamath Palihapitiya Investor Palihapitiya believes a SPAC merger would have been better for Circle In just 15 days, Circle’s market cap was close to surpassing the $50 billion mark , following the huge spike in stock. However, employees have had to part with about $3 billion over the required share sell-off in the same period. As part of the IPO process, the USDC stablecoin issuer sold 14.4M shares, now valued at $3.456 B. Palihapitiya hoped the company would opt for a SPAC merger rather than the traditional IPO listing. He argued that, as much as the company disapproves of SPAC founder promotions or other forms of value transfer to intermediaries, traditional IPOs have value moved to arbitrary parties, which, in his words, “makes no sense.” He added that the benefits of SPACs and direct listings are clearly laid out from the start, which can be negotiated and optimized to serve the interests of selling and buying shareholders, unlike traditional IPOs. He stated that banks show more opacity with IPOs, and the media only adds to the problem by celebrating first-day stock jumps, which is sometimes not a great sign. He suggested it could indicate the deal was mispriced, allowing banks to hand out free stock to their top clients, many of whom had no connection to the company. Like with the case of Circle , the $3 billion went to unknown people who had nothing to do with the company, its employees, or investors. More companies are opting for SPAC mergers, including SRM Entertainment Recently, Tron Founder Justin Sun revealed his partnership with SRM Entertainment, opting for a SPAC merger rather than going through a conventional IPO. SRM Entertainment is set to change to Tron Inc., with some reports suggesting that Dominari Securities—a boutique investment bank linked to former President Donald Trump—will oversee the reverse merger. SRM Entertainment also confirmed that they agreed on a $100 million equity investment and that it would issue preferred shares and warrants that could raise the deal’s value to about $210 million. The company also stated that its gains will be directed to a Tron Reserve. Earlier this month, Parataxis Holdings , a BTC investment platform, announced it would go public through a SPAC merger with SilverBox Corp IV. The merger would help the company focus on institutional-grade Bitcoin and increase its appeal in public markets. Joe Reece, co-managing partner at SilverBox Capital, asserted that their collaboration would bring a unique and highly scalable digital asset management platform to the public markets.

2025-06-21T13:40:15,"US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Maintain Strong Momentum with 9th Straight Day of Inflows","BitcoinWorld US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Maintain Strong Momentum with 9th Straight Day of Inflows Hey crypto enthusiasts! Let’s dive into some encouraging news from the world of institutional Bitcoin adoption. The latest data shows a significant milestone for US spot Bitcoin ETFs, logging their ninth consecutive day of net positive inflows. This steady stream of capital is certainly catching the attention of market watchers. What Exactly Are US Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Why Do Inflows Matter? Before we break down the numbers, let’s quickly touch on what we’re talking about. US spot Bitcoin ETFs are investment vehicles that allow people to gain exposure to the price of Bitcoin (BTC) without directly buying and holding the cryptocurrency itself. The ‘spot’ part means these funds ideally hold actual Bitcoin to back the shares they issue. Think of it as a regulated, traditional finance wrapper around a crypto asset. Why are inflows important? Well, when a spot ETF records ‘net inflows,’ it means more money is coming into the fund than leaving it. To accommodate this new money, the ETF issuer typically has to buy more of the underlying asset – in this case, Bitcoin. Therefore, consistent net inflows into Bitcoin ETF inflows signal strong demand from investors, often large institutions or sophisticated wealth managers, which can have a positive impact on the price and overall market sentiment for BTC. Analyzing the Latest Bitcoin ETF Inflows: June 20th Snapshot According to data shared by Trader T (@thepfund) on X, June 20th saw a total net inflow of $6.32 million across all operational US spot Bitcoin ETFs. While this figure might seem modest compared to some previous days, its significance lies in the context: it marks the ninth day in a row that these funds have collectively seen more money enter than exit. Let’s look at the performance of the individual funds on that specific day: BlackRock’s IBIT: Continued its strong performance, leading the pack with a significant $46.87 million in inflows. BlackRock’s fund has consistently been a major recipient of capital since its launch. Fidelity’s FBTC: Experienced an outflow of $40.55 million . It’s not uncommon for individual funds to see outflows on any given day, even when the overall market is positive. These movements can be due to various factors, including portfolio rebalancing by large investors. Other Funds: Most other US spot Bitcoin ETFs reported no change in their holdings on June 20th. This data highlights the dynamic nature of the ETF market, where capital flows can vary between different products even within the same asset class. However, the key takeaway remains the aggregate net positive flow for the ninth consecutive day. What Do Nine Straight Days of BTC ETF Inflows Signal? A streak of consecutive net inflows, especially one reaching nine days, is a powerful indicator. Here’s what it suggests: Sustained Demand: It’s not just a one-off event. There is persistent buying pressure from investors utilizing the BTC ETF structure. Positive Sentiment: Despite recent price volatility in the broader crypto market, the consistent inflows suggest underlying confidence in Bitcoin as an asset class among ETF investors. Institutional Adoption: A significant portion of investment into US spot Bitcoin ETFs is believed to come from institutional players and financial advisors. This streak reinforces the narrative of growing mainstream and institutional adoption of Bitcoin via these regulated products. Potential Price Support: While not a direct one-to-one correlation, sustained inflows forcing ETFs to buy more BTC can contribute to increased demand in the spot market, potentially providing a level of price support. The performance of funds like BlackRock IBIT underscores which products are currently favored by investors channeling money into this space. Looking Ahead: The Trajectory of US Spot Bitcoin ETFs The launch of US spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year was a landmark event for the crypto industry, opening up regulated pathways for investment. The current streak of inflows, even with some funds like Fidelity FBTC seeing outflows on specific days, points towards continued interest. While market conditions can change rapidly, the nine-day inflow streak suggests that the initial excitement around these products hasn’t entirely faded. Investors are still actively allocating capital, indicating a longer-term view on Bitcoin’s role in investment portfolios. Key Takeaways from the Latest Data US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded their 9th consecutive day of net inflows on June 20th. The total net inflow for the day was $6.32 million. BlackRock’s IBIT led inflows with $46.87 million. Fidelity’s FBTC saw outflows of $40.55 million. Consistent inflows highlight sustained demand and positive sentiment for Bitcoin via the ETF structure. Institutional adoption continues to be a key theme driving these flows. In conclusion, the run of consecutive net inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs is a compelling signal of underlying demand and positive sentiment in the market. While daily figures can fluctuate between individual funds like BlackRock IBIT and Fidelity FBTC , the overall trend points towards continued interest and potentially growing institutional involvement in the Bitcoin space through these regulated investment products.

Powered by aggressive accumulation from smart money and whales, and supported by thinning exchange balances, the meme coin has hit a $100 million market cap and caught the attention of traders hunting for upside. While momentum indicators now flash caution, Useless Coin’s rise underscores the unpredictable nature of meme-driven markets—and the powerful role of investor sentiment. Useless Coin (USELESS) token jumped to a high of $0.1092 this week, up by over 1,750% from its lowest level in June. Useless token price jumped even as the crypto market crashed, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) falling from a record high of $111,900 in May to $103,000. Most Solana ( SOL ) meme coins have dropped this month, with their market capitalization falling from over $15 billion earlier this month to $9 billion. Nansen data shows that smart money investors have been buying the coin. Data shows that its smart money investors bought Useless tokens worth over $94,000 in the last 24 hours.

For example, the Average Directional Index has plunged from a record high of 70 to 20. The ADX is a popular indicator that measures the strength of a trend. The MACD and the Relative Strength Index have also formed a bearish divergence pattern, pointing to a potential retreat. Therefore, the coin may drop to the support at $0.50 as traders start to book profits.

2025-06-21T13:15:00,"Will Bitcoin Survive Without Trump? Hedge Funds Aren’t Convinced, Says Semler","Eric Semler, chairman of Semler Scientific Inc., believes many hedge funds remain unconvinced about Bitcoin’s long-term viability beyond the Trump administration. Key Takeaways: Eric Semler says many hedge funds doubt Bitcoin’s future beyond the Trump administration. Despite skepticism, Semler’s firm is aggressively building a BTC treasury, targeting 105,000 coins. Crypto exposure among hedge funds is rising, with nearly half now holding digital assets. Speaking in an interview with Natalie Brunell on Coin Stories, Semler said traditional finance still views Bitcoin as a fleeting trend that may not survive political transition. “I think that they think it is a fly-by-night concept and that it is probably going to, after the Trump administration, go back down a lot,” said Semler, who also founded TCS Capital Management. Trump’s Crypto Push Faces Uncertainty Beyond His Term His remarks come as debate grows over whether U.S. political support for crypto will endure past President Trump’s term. While Trump recently endorsed a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, figures like JAN3 CEO Samson Mow have warned that such initiatives could quickly unravel under a different administration. Despite broader skepticism, Semler has gone in the opposite direction. In May, Semler Scientific became only the second U.S. public company to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy. The firm currently holds 4,449 BTC and plans to ramp that up to 105,000 BTC within two and a half years, targeting 10,000 BTC by year-end. For Semler, institutional doubt is part of the opportunity. “When you’re making a bet on something that the majority doesn’t believe in, and you’re right, you make so much more money,” he said. “I love the negativity; I’m a contrarian investor,” he added, noting that his most profitable investments came when others were dismissive. “Those are the types of investments that have the highest returns.” While some hedge fund managers are still hesitant, the broader trend suggests rising crypto exposure. “We’re focused on becoming a powerhouse in #Bitcoin .” New episode just released featuring Chairman Eric Semler and CFO Renae Cormier of Semler Scientific $SMLR .

Looking further back, a 2021 Intertrust Global survey of hedge fund CFOs showed that nearly all expected to allocate 7.2% of their portfolios to crypto by 2026. VanEck Warns BTC Treasury Strategy May Backfire Just recently, VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, raised concerns about the Bitcoin treasury strategies used by certain public companies, suggesting that continued accumulation of BTC could soon harm shareholders more than help. He specifically criticized the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, warning that they can become dilutive when stock prices approach the company’s Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). Sigel proposed several measures to prevent value erosion, including pausing ATM programs if a company’s stock trades below 0.95x NAV for over 10 days. He drew comparisons to past failures in the crypto mining sector, where excessive dilution and executive pay led to major shareholder losses. As an example, he cited Semler Scientific, a medical tech firm that entered the BTC space in 2024. Despite acquiring 3,808 BTC, its stock has fallen over 45%, and its mNAV has dropped to 0.82x.

2025-06-21T13:10:50,"Trump-Linked Nakamoto Holdings Raises $51.5M to Expand Bitcoin Treasury","Nakamoto Holdings, the Bitcoin-focused firm founded by U.S. President Donald Trump’s crypto adviser David Bailey, has secured $51.5 million through a private placement in public equity (PIPE) deal. The announcement came via merger partner KindlyMD, which confirmed the rapid fundraising was completed in under 72 hours, highlighting strong investor interest in the company’s BTC accumulation strategy. “Investor demand for Nakamoto is incredibly strong,” Bailey said in a statement. “We continue to execute our strategy to raise as much capital as possible to acquire as much Bitcoin as possible.” The new funding was priced at $5.00 per share, pushing KindlyMD’s total fundraising to $563 million — or $763 million when including convertible notes. The proceeds from this round will be used to purchase BTC, support working capital needs, and finance broader corporate operations. The PIPE financing will close concurrently with the finalization of Nakamoto’s merger with KindlyMD, which currently trades on the Nasdaq under the ticker NAKA. Building a Bitcoin Treasury Amid Market Caution Founded earlier this year, Nakamoto Holdings is modeled after other firms that have used Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset . Its mission is clear: amass a significant BTC treasury while the market offers a long-term opportunity. Despite mixed sentiment in the crypto sector, the company’s aggressive approach appears to be gaining traction with investors eager for exposure to Bitcoin’s potential upside. The merger with KindlyMD was approved by shareholders last month and is expected to be completed in Q3 2025. Post-merger, the combined entity aims to launch a series of BTC-native ventures, using a mix of equity and debt to fund operations and grow its BTC reserves. This move is part of a larger trend of corporate adoption of Bitcoin, signaling how digital assets are becoming increasingly prominent on company balance sheets. Growing Corporate Interest, Rising Risk According to data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET, at least 27 firms have added Bitcoin to their treasuries in the past month alone. The trend underscores a growing belief among businesses that BTC can serve as a hedge or strategic financial asset. However, not everyone is convinced. Fakhul Miah of GoMining Institutional warns that smaller firms may be jumping into Bitcoin out of pressure or hype rather than sound financial planning.

2025-06-21T13:00:00,"Pi Network price eyes a strong rebound as a rare pattern forms","Pi Coin’s steep decline since May reflects waning hype and thinning liquidity following its mainnet launch, but technical patterns and upcoming events suggest a potential reversal. As volatility dries up and the price consolidates within a classic bullish wedge formation, momentum may return ahead of Pi Day 2 on June 28 and ongoing domain auction excitement. While risks remain, the stage is quietly being set for a possible rebound driven by both chart signals and fresh ecosystem developments. Technicals point to a Pi Network price comeback Yes, Pi Coin ( PI ) crashed into a deep bear market after plunging by over 60% from its highest point in May. It dropped to $0.5370 on Saturday, June 21, with its 24-hour volume falling to $74 million from a peak of $3 billion after its mainnet launch in February. The eight-hour chart shows that the Pi Coin price jumped to a high of $1.6675 in May. This surge happened as investors waited for the promised ecosystem news during the Consensus event in Toronto. It then plunged after the developers launched Pi Network Ventures , a $100 million fund to invest in startups. The chart shows that the MACD indicator has continued falling, a sign that it is not volatile. Similarly, the three lines of the Donchian Channels have narrowed, also a sign that they are not volatile. A period of low volatility is often a sign of accumulation among investors, which results in a bullish breakout. You might also like: Here’s why the Kaia price has gone parabolic Pi Network price has formed a falling wedge pattern, consisting of two descending and converging trendlines. A falling wedge is often a highly bullish reversal sign. The two lines of this wedge have narrowed, meaning that the coin may have a strong bullish breakout in the next few weeks. If this happens, the next potential target to watch will be $1, which is about 85% above the current level. The bullish Pi Coin price forecast will be invalidated if it drops below the key support at $0.3940, its lowest point this month. Pi Network price chart | Source: crypto.news Pi Day 2 could be a catalyst Pi Network has some potential catalysts that may push it higher in the longer term. For example, it could gain traction ahead of Pi Day 2 celebration on June 28. Also known as Tau Day, it is an alternative to the main Pi Day on March 14. This commemoration will happen on the same day that the .pi domain auction ends. Pi Domains had over 123,000 active bids and over 3 million bids during the auction. Another potential catalyst for Pi price is the ongoing ecosystem growth. In a note , the developers cited several applications that have launched on the network, including FruityPi, a fruit-matching game. Pi Network may also rebound as the odds of Federal Reserve cuts rise. In a statement on Friday, Christopher Waller, a Fed Governor, said that the bank may cut rates as early as July, which may benefit Bitcoin and other coins.

2025-06-21T12:57:24,"Forget Bitcoin – These 5 Altcoins Could Outperform Everything in the Next Bull Run","While Bitcoin remains the crypto market’s anchor, the real action in the next bull run might come from the shadows. A fresh wave of altcoins is quietly positioning for major moves — and savvy investors are already watching closely. From DeFi leaders to real-world asset pioneers, these five projects could not only rival Bitcoin’s performance but potentially leave it in the dust. Let’s break down which altcoins are flashing early signals of breakout potential. Worldcoin (WLD): A Deep Discount with Massive Upside Potential Source: tradingview Worldcoin may be trading between $0.87 and $1.15, but this consolidation could be the calm before a breakout. With key resistance levels at $1.32 and $1.60, a reversal could offer gains of over 85%. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) dipping below 40 suggests the asset is oversold, potentially setting the stage for a strong rebound. As the project continues pushing forward with global digital identity infrastructure, it holds the kind of long-term vision that often gets rediscovered during bullish cycles. If sentiment shifts even slightly, WLD could catch fire quickly. Hedera (HBAR): Ready to Rebound from Oversold Conditions Source: tradingview Despite recent pullbacks, Hedera’s current zone between $0.14 and $0.18 puts it at a strategic accumulation level. The RSI hovering near oversold levels hints that bearish momentum may be fading. If HBAR climbs past the $0.20–$0.23 range, it could quickly unlock upside potential. With an expanding ecosystem, carbon-negative network credentials, and enterprise use cases across banking, supply chain, and sustainability, Hedera remains one of the most undervalued Layer-1s. The next market rally may finally reward its steady and institutional-grade growth. Ondo (ONDO): Undervalued with Strong RWA Narrative Source: tradingview Ondo’s price action around $0.72–$0.89 reflects a market in wait mode, but technicals show a setup for reversal. Its RSI below 40 highlights undervaluation, and a move past $0.99 could unlock a clean run toward $1.16 or higher—a potential 30% gain. As a leader in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), Ondo’s strong fundamentals could drive renewed investor interest when market confidence returns. With increasing institutional attention toward on-chain treasuries and yield products, ONDO could be a strategic long play in a sector that’s just getting started. Uniswap (UNI): Set to Break Free with DeFi Momentum Source: tradingview Uniswap is holding steady between $6.03 and $8.49, with signs of building momentum after gaining 11% over the past month. Key support at $4.89 looks solid, and if bulls break the $9 mark, UNI could target $12—a potential 50% surge. As DeFi adoption accelerates, UNI remains one of the top platforms set to benefit from renewed market enthusiasm. Its dominance in decentralized exchange volume and the upcoming V4 upgrade could serve as major catalysts. With the right macro backdrop, Uniswap could once again lead the DeFi narrative. Ethena (ENA): A Comeback Story in the Making Source: tradingview Trading in the $0.26–$0.36 range, Ethena may seem quiet, but the chart paints a different picture. The $0.22 support is holding strong, and a breakout above $0.42 could lead to a rapid push toward $0.52—up to 44% higher. With interest in synthetic dollar solutions growing, ENA’s use case could make it a major gainer when the next wave of buyers enters the market. The project is still in its early growth phase, and volatility often comes before momentum in emerging narratives. Ethena may be one sharp breakout away from renewed attention. Conclusion In a market where Bitcoin often takes the spotlight, it's easy to overlook the hidden gems brewing just beneath the surface. But as history shows, bull markets are defined by unexpected winners. Whether it's the tokenization of real-world assets, decentralized finance innovation, or next-gen identity protocols — these five altcoins are armed with strong narratives and favorable technicals. If the bull run kicks off soon, they may not just follow the trend — they could lead it. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-21T12:40:59,"Texas Enacts Crucial Law Safeguarding Bitcoin Reserves","BitcoinWorld Texas Enacts Crucial Law Safeguarding Bitcoin Reserves The Lone Star State is making waves in the digital asset space! Texas Governor Greg Abbott has taken a significant step, signing legislation that directly impacts how the state handles potential Bitcoin reserves . This move highlights Texas’s growing interest in and support for the cryptocurrency sector. What Does HB 4488 Mean for Texas Bitcoin Holdings? Governor Greg Abbott recently enacted House Bill 4488, a piece of legislation that brings important protections for specific state funds. At its core, HB 4488 is designed to prevent designated state funds from being automatically transferred into general revenue. Why is this significant for digital assets? According to reports, this protection explicitly extends to any Bitcoin reserves or other digital asset holdings that might be established outside of the traditional state treasury framework. This provides a layer of security and stability for potential state-held digital assets, ensuring they aren’t subject to routine sweeps into the general state budget. Here are the key takeaways from HB 4488: Fund Protection: Prevents designated state funds from being swept into general revenue. Digital Asset Inclusion: Explicitly includes digital asset holdings, such as Texas Bitcoin reserves, established outside the main treasury. Increased Security: Offers a degree of stability and protection for these specific digital asset holdings. This legislative action signals a proactive approach from Texas in creating a framework that acknowledges and potentially accommodates digital assets within its financial structure. Will Texas Soon Be Buying Bitcoin? Exploring Senate Bill 21 While HB 4488 is now law, the fate of another crucial piece of legislation, Senate Bill 21 (SB 21), remains undecided by Governor Greg Abbott Bitcoin policy actions are being closely watched, and SB 21 could represent an even bolder step. SB 21 proposes permitting the state to purchase digital assets. However, it includes a significant condition: the state would only be allowed to acquire digital assets with a market capitalization of at least $500 billion. Currently, only Bitcoin consistently meets this substantial market cap requirement. If signed into law, SB 21 could pave the way for Texas to become a direct holder of Bitcoin, potentially adding it to state investment portfolios or reserves. This would be a landmark move, positioning Texas at the forefront of state-level digital asset adoption in the U.S. Comparing the two bills: HB 4488 (Signed): Focus: Protecting *existing or future* digital asset holdings (like Bitcoin reserves ) held *outside* the treasury from general fund sweeps. Action: Defensive/Protective measure for digital assets. Impact: Creates a safer environment for state entities considering or holding digital assets outside the traditional treasury. SB 21 (Pending): Focus: Enabling the state to *purchase* digital assets meeting a high market cap threshold ($500B+). Action: Offensive/Acquisition measure for digital assets (specifically Bitcoin, given the threshold). Impact: Could potentially make Texas a direct investor in Bitcoin. The decision on SB 21 is highly anticipated, as it could significantly alter the landscape for Texas crypto bill initiatives. Why is Texas Embracing Digital Assets? Texas has positioned itself as a friendly environment for the cryptocurrency industry, attracting miners, blockchain companies, and innovators. This legislative push, including HB 4488 and the consideration of SB 21, aligns with that broader strategy. Several factors likely contribute to this stance: Economic Development: Attracting crypto businesses creates jobs and stimulates economic activity. Innovation Hub: Aiming to be a leader in emerging technologies. Diversification: Exploring alternative assets for state funds (as potentially allowed by SB 21). Property Rights: Framing digital asset ownership within existing property rights frameworks. Governor Greg Abbott Bitcoin -related actions are seen by many in the crypto community as a positive signal, indicating governmental recognition and support for the asset class. Benefits and Implications of the Texas Crypto Bill The enactment of HB 4488 and the potential passage of SB 21 carry significant implications: Benefits: Increased Legitimacy: State-level action lends credibility to Bitcoin and other digital assets. Attracting Investment: A clear legal framework encourages more crypto businesses and investors to come to Texas. Potential State Asset Diversification: SB 21 could open doors for diversifying state holdings with an uncorrelated asset like Bitcoin. Setting a Precedent: Texas’s actions could influence other states to explore similar legislation regarding Bitcoin reserves and digital asset ownership. Potential Challenges/Considerations: Regulatory Uncertainty: While Texas is acting, the federal regulatory landscape remains complex. Market Volatility: Holding volatile assets like Bitcoin carries risks, which would need careful management if SB 21 passes. Custody and Security: Managing state-held digital assets requires robust security and custody solutions. The Texas crypto bill landscape is evolving rapidly, and these recent developments are key indicators of the state’s direction. Actionable Insights for Readers What does this mean for you, whether you’re a crypto holder, investor, or simply interested in the space? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on state-level legislative developments, not just federal ones. Texas is a significant player. Understand the Nuances: Differentiate between protective bills like HB 4488 (safeguarding existing/future holdings) and enabling bills like SB 21 (allowing purchase). Observe Trends: Texas’s actions are part of a broader trend of increasing institutional and governmental interest in digital assets. The actions taken by Greg Abbott Bitcoin and crypto-related legislation in Texas provide valuable insights into how traditional governance structures are beginning to interact with decentralized technologies. Conclusion: Texas Solidifies Its Pro-Crypto Stance Governor Greg Abbott’s signing of HB 4488 is a concrete step by Texas to provide a protective legal foundation for digital assets, including potential Bitcoin reserves held outside the traditional treasury. While the decision on SB 21, which could enable direct state investment in Bitcoin, is still pending, the direction is clear: Texas aims to be a leader in the digital asset space. This Texas crypto bill activity not only supports the state’s growing crypto industry but also signals to the broader market that digital assets are increasingly being considered within established financial and governmental frameworks. As the landscape continues to evolve, Texas’s legislative actions will remain a key area to watch.

2025-06-21T12:30:55,"Peter Schiff Issues Warning on USD Stablecoins, Favors Gold","BitcoinWorld Peter Schiff Issues Warning on USD Stablecoins, Favors Gold Well-known economist and outspoken crypto skeptic, Peter Schiff , has once again stirred the pot in the cryptocurrency world, this time setting his sights on USD stablecoins . While Schiff is famously critical of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, his recent comments highlight a specific concern regarding digital assets pegged to traditional fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. Peter Schiff’s Skepticism: Why Question USD Stablecoins? In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Peter Schiff , who serves as Chief Economist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, articulated his doubts about the fundamental value proposition of USD stablecoins . His core argument centers on the backing asset itself – the U.S. dollar. Schiff has long been a critic of government-issued fiat currencies, particularly the dollar, citing concerns about inflation, devaluation, and government debt. His skepticism towards USD stablecoins stems directly from this view. He questions why investors would opt for a digital asset whose stability is tied to a currency he believes is inherently flawed and subject to losing purchasing power over time. According to CoinDesk’s report on his comments, Schiff believes that choosing a digital asset pegged to a depreciating asset (in his view, the dollar) makes little sense when alternatives backed by what he considers a superior store of value, like gold, are available. Understanding Stablecoins: Beyond the Fiat Peg To appreciate Schiff’s perspective, it helps to understand what stablecoins are and how they function. At their heart, stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to minimize price volatility, unlike assets such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. They achieve this stability by pegging their market value to another, more stable asset. The most common type are fiat currency -backed stablecoins , where each digital token is supposedly backed by an equivalent reserve of traditional currency (like USD, EUR, etc.) held in a bank account. Examples include Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), which aim to maintain a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar. Other types of stablecoins exist: Crypto-backed stablecoins: Over-collateralized with other cryptocurrencies (e.g., Dai). Algorithmic stablecoins: Use complex algorithms and smart contracts to maintain price stability without direct asset backing (these have proven highly volatile and risky). Commodity-backed stablecoins: Pegged to assets like gold, oil, or real estate. Schiff’s focus is specifically on the first category, the USD stablecoins , which he sees as inheriting the weaknesses of the underlying fiat asset. The Allure of Gold-Backed Stablecoins Given his long-standing advocacy for gold as a reliable store of value, it’s unsurprising that Peter Schiff sees gold-backed stablecoins as a more sensible alternative. Unlike fiat, gold has a history spanning millennia as a medium of exchange and a store of wealth, largely independent of government policies. Gold-backed stablecoins aim to combine the stability associated with gold with the benefits of blockchain technology – ease of transfer, divisibility, and potential transparency (depending on the specific implementation and auditing). Each token in a gold-backed stablecoin system is typically claimed to represent a specific amount of physical gold held in secure vaults. Schiff himself acknowledged the existence of such offerings and, in response to a user suggestion, even stated his intention to potentially launch his own gold-backed stablecoin . This move would align his digital asset strategy with his core economic philosophy, offering investors a digital way to hold an asset tied to physical gold rather than a fiat currency he distrusts. Benefits Highlighted by Gold Advocates: Store of Value: Gold is historically seen as preserving purchasing power over long periods, unlike inflationary fiat currencies. Hedge Against Inflation/Devaluation: Gold tends to perform well during times of economic uncertainty or currency devaluation. Tangible Backing: Represents ownership in a physical asset, not just a claim on fiat reserves. Accessibility: Offers a potentially easier and more divisible way to invest in gold compared to buying physical bars or coins. Challenges for Gold-Backed Stablecoins: Custody and Auditing: Ensuring the physical gold actually exists and is securely stored requires robust auditing and trust. Liquidity: May not be as liquid or widely accepted for transactions as major USD stablecoins . Fees: Storage, insurance, and management fees for the physical gold can impact the token’s value or incur costs. Regulatory Uncertainty: Like all cryptocurrencies, they face evolving regulatory landscapes. Fiat Currency: The Foundation Schiff Questions The heart of Peter Schiff’s critique lies in his fundamental distrust of modern fiat currency systems. Fiat money, like the U.S. dollar, is not backed by a physical commodity (like gold) but by the full faith and credit of the government that issues it. Its value is derived from government decree and public trust. Schiff and others in the Austrian economics tradition argue that central banks’ ability to print money and governments’ tendency to run deficits inevitably lead to inflation, eroding the purchasing power of fiat currency over time. This makes assets denominated in or pegged to fiat, like USD stablecoins , susceptible to the same devaluation. From this perspective, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar is only as stable as the dollar itself. If the dollar loses 10% of its value due to inflation, the USD stablecoin , maintaining its 1:1 peg, also effectively loses 10% of its purchasing power relative to goods and services. Navigating the Stablecoin Landscape: Insights for Investors Peter Schiff’s comments highlight a critical debate within the digital asset space: what makes a stable digital asset truly ‘stable’ or valuable in the long term? For investors, this raises important considerations: Actionable Insights: Understand the Backing: Don’t just see ‘stablecoin’; investigate what asset it is pegged to and how that peg is maintained (reserves, algorithms, etc.). Assess the Underlying Asset: Consider the stability and long-term prospects of the asset backing the stablecoin (Is it a fiat currency you trust? A commodity? Another crypto?). Evaluate Reserve Transparency and Audits: Especially for fiat or commodity-backed stablecoins, look for clear, regular, and independent audits of the reserves. Consider Your Goals: Are you using stablecoins for short-term trading liquidity (where USD stablecoins are dominant) or as a long-term store of value (where gold-backed stablecoins might appeal to those sharing Schiff’s view)? Diversification: As with any investment, don’t put all your eggs in one basket, whether it’s one type of stablecoin or just stablecoins in general. Stay Informed on Regulation: The regulatory environment for all types of stablecoins is rapidly evolving, which can impact their availability and stability. While USD stablecoins currently dominate the market due to their deep liquidity and ease of use within the crypto ecosystem, Schiff’s arguments serve as a reminder that their perceived stability is intrinsically linked to the health and future of the U.S. dollar itself. Alternatives like gold-backed stablecoins offer a different value proposition, appealing to those seeking digital exposure to assets historically viewed as hedges against fiat currency instability. Conclusion: The Ongoing Debate Over Digital Stability Peter Schiff’s skepticism towards USD stablecoins is a natural extension of his long-held views on fiat currency and the enduring value of gold. He challenges the fundamental premise of pegging a digital asset to a currency he sees as prone to devaluation, advocating instead for the stability offered by gold-backed stablecoins . This debate is crucial for the future of digital assets. While USD stablecoins currently serve vital functions in the crypto market, the discussion around alternative backing assets like gold highlights different philosophies on what constitutes true, long-term stability in a digital format. Investors must look beyond the ‘stable’ label and understand the underlying mechanics and assets that give a stablecoin its value, considering whether they trust the future of fiat currency or prefer assets with a longer history as a store of wealth.

2025-06-21T12:30:19,"Bitcoin Net Taker Volume Enters Deep Red On Binance — What’s Next For BTC Price?","After another strong play for its all-time high in the past week, the price of Bitcoin has struggled to build on its recent bullish momentum. Over the last few days, the premier cryptocurrency has been specifically slow and lethargic. On Friday, June 20, the Bitcoin price took a severe hit — together with the rest of the crypto market — and fell briefly beneath the $103,000 mark. However, the latest market data suggests that the price of BTC might enjoy some stability after the recent round of long liquidations. BTC Gearing For A Run Of ‘Healthier Price Action’: Analyst In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, on-chain analyst Amr Taha explained the dynamics between the Bitcoin price and its recent long liquidation event. According to the online pundit, the market leader could be preparing for more stable price action over the next few weeks. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Gearing Up for a Breakout? On-Chain Signals Say ‘Watch This Level’ Taha revealed that the critical $103,000 liquidation cluster, which held a large volume of overleveraged long positions on Binance, has been cleared off. This cascade of long liquidations came after the price of Bitcoin plunged toward the $102,500 level on Friday evening. According to data from CryptoQuant, the price decline caused the long liquidations on Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume, to exceed $160 million. The on-chain analyst noted that this long liquidation event also coincided with a major change in the Bitcoin Net Taker Volume on the cryptocurrency exchange. Taha highlighted that the Net Taker Volume has moved deep into the negative territory, falling to nearly -$100 million in the past day. As observed in the chart below, this latest plunge marks the third time the Net taker Volume has fallen to this level in the month of June. According to Taha, the change in this metric suggests that aggressive selling outweighed buying activity during the liquidation event. The on-chain analyst outlines two possible reasons for this trend, including that long positions were forced to close, pushing sell orders into the market as the Bitcoin price fell below $103,000. Taha added that some sections of Bitcoin retail traders might have pushed the panic button and filled new sell orders in fear of further losses. In the end, the crypto analyst concluded that the combination of long liquidations and extremely negative Net Taker Volume might not be completely bad for the flagship cryptocurrency. Taha said: While such events often feel devastating in the moment, they lay the groundwork for healthier price action. Given these dynamics, the path of least resistance may now shift upward as Bitcoin stabilizes above key support levels with reduced leverage overhead. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $103,450, reflecting an over 1% decline in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Gearing Up for a Breakout?

2025-06-21T12:30:00,"Ethereum holds the line: ETF inflows slow, yet bullish setup forms","Ethereum price remained inside a tight range this week as inflows into its exchange-traded funds slowed. Ethereum ( ETH ) dropped to a low of $2,400 this week as the crypto market crash continued. Its lowest level was down by 16% from its highest level this month, meaning it is in a technical correction. SoSoValue data shows that spot Ethereum ETFs added $40 million in inflows this week, down from $528 million a week earlier. It was the smallest increase since the week of May 16. There are two likely reasons for the significant drop in ETF inflows. First, these inflows slowed as investors remained in the sidelines as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies dropped. You might also like: Staked ETH eclipses 35m as crypto reserves fuel supply squeeze Second, inflows slowed this week because it had four working days in the US. Markets were closed on Thursday, which was Juneteenth, a federal holiday. On the positive side, Ethereum ETFs have had inflows in the last six consecutive weeks, the longest streak since their approval in September last year. The cumulative ETF inflows is $3.89 billion, bringing the total assets in these funds to $9.6 billion. BlackRock’s ETHA ETF had cumulative inflows of $5.28 billion, while Fidelity’s FETH has $1.1 billion. Ethereum price retreated as its ecosystem metrics deteriorated. For example, the stablecoin transaction volume in Ethereum has dropped by 31% in the last 30 days to $1.2 trillion. Ethereum price technical analysis ETH price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the Ethereum price has moved sideways since May 10. It has remained inside the support and resistance levels at $2,410 and $2,736. This consolidation is part of the formation of the bullish flag. This pattern consists of a vertical price increase driven by strong demand and a short-term consolidation. The bullish flag occurs between the 50% and 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement levels. It also occurs after the coin rises above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages. Therefore, the coin will likely have a strong bullish breakout as long as it remains above the lower side of the flag at $2,400. More gains will be confirmed if the price moves above the upper side of the flag at $2,735. If this happens, the next point to watch will be the psychological point at $3,000.

2025-06-21T12:20:48,"Urgent Alert: Altcoin Season Index Plunges to 19, Signaling Bitcoin Dominance","BitcoinWorld Urgent Alert: Altcoin Season Index Plunges to 19, Signaling Bitcoin Dominance Are you wondering why your favorite altcoins might not be performing as well as Bitcoin lately? The latest data from the Altcoin Season Index provides a clear answer, pointing towards a significant shift in the crypto market landscape. Understanding the Alt coin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool for cryptocurrency investors and traders. Tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), it offers insight into whether the broader market is favoring altcoins or Bitcoin over a specific period. This index helps gauge market sentiment and identify potential trends. Here’s how the index fundamentally works: It analyzes the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CMC. Stablecoins and wrapped tokens are excluded from the calculation to provide a clearer picture of speculative asset performance. The performance of each of these top 100 coins is compared against Bitcoin ‘s performance over the past 90 days. The index score ranges from 1 to 100. The threshold for determining market season is based on how many of these top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin : Altcoin Season: Occurs when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index score is typically high (above 75). Bitcoin Season: Occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index score is typically low (25 or below). Scores between 26 and 74 generally indicate a neutral or transitional market phase. Why the Altcoin Season Index at 19 Matters As of June 21, at 00:38 UTC, the Altcoin Season Index registered a score of 19. This figure is down three points from the previous day. A score of 19 falls squarely into the definition of Bitcoin Season . This low number signals that a significant majority of the top 100 altcoins have failed to keep pace with, let alone outperform, Bitcoin over the recent 90-day period. This shift isn’t just a number; it reflects capital flows and investor preference. During a Bitcoin Season , investors tend to favor the perceived safety and dominance of Bitcoin , often rotating capital out of smaller, more volatile altcoins . This can lead to Bitcoin seeing stronger price gains or holding its value better during downturns compared to the rest of the crypto market . Navigating the Current Bitcoin Season in the Crypto Market Being in a Bitcoin Season presents both challenges and opportunities for participants in the crypto market . For those holding a diversified portfolio heavily weighted towards altcoins , this period can be frustrating as their holdings may underperform relative to Bitcoin . Challenges during Bitcoin Season: Altcoin Underperformance: Most altcoins will struggle to gain ground against Bitcoin . Increased Volatility for Altcoins: Smaller cap altcoins can experience sharper drops when Bitcoin corrects or consolidates. Lower Trading Volume for Altcoins: Interest and capital can consolidate around Bitcoin , leading to less liquidity in some altcoin markets. Opportunities during Bitcoin Season: Potential for Bitcoin Accumulation: Investors focused on accumulating Bitcoin may find relative strength. Identifying Resilient Altcoins: Some altcoins may show relative strength even during Bitcoin Season , potentially indicating strong fundamentals or specific catalysts. Strategic Positioning: Understanding the current market phase allows investors to adjust their strategies, perhaps increasing Bitcoin exposure or waiting for the market to signal a potential shift back towards altcoins . What Does This Mean for Your Altcoins ? If you hold altcoins , the current Bitcoin Season means you should temper expectations regarding their short-term performance relative to Bitcoin . It doesn’t necessarily mean all altcoins will lose value, but their gains are likely to lag significantly behind Bitcoin ‘s, or they may even see declines while Bitcoin remains relatively stable or rises. Consider reviewing your portfolio: Diversification: Is your portfolio overly exposed to smaller altcoins ? Risk Tolerance: Are you comfortable with the increased volatility that altcoins might experience during this phase? Long-Term View: For projects you believe in long-term, periods of underperformance against Bitcoin can sometimes present accumulation opportunities, but caution is advised as further drops are possible. This phase underscores Bitcoin ‘s continued dominance and its role as the primary driver of overall market sentiment and capital movement. While the dream of massive, quick gains in small altcoins is often associated with Altcoin Season , the current data indicates we are in a different part of the market cycle. Conclusion: Staying Informed in the Crypto Market The Altcoin Season Index at 19 serves as a clear indicator that the crypto market is currently experiencing Bitcoin Season . This phase is characterized by Bitcoin ‘s relative strength and the underperformance of most altcoins . Understanding this market dynamic is crucial for making informed decisions. While market cycles can shift rapidly, the data suggests caution for aggressive altcoin plays and highlights the importance of monitoring Bitcoin ‘s performance. Keeping an eye on the Altcoin Season Index and other market indicators will be key to identifying potential shifts back towards a more favorable environment for altcoins in the future.

2025-06-21T12:10:44,"Bitcoin Open Interest Hits $96B: A Powerful Catalyst for Price Action","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Open Interest Hits $96B: A Powerful Catalyst for Price Action Hey there, crypto enthusiasts! Let’s dive into some exciting news straight from the Bitcoin market. We’re talking about a significant metric that’s been making waves: Bitcoin open interest . This figure has recently hit a staggering $96 billion, a level that has analysts buzzing about what could be next for the Bitcoin price . Understanding open interest is key to grasping market sentiment and potential future movements. It represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures or options, that have not yet been settled. A rising open interest, especially when paired with a rising price, is often seen as a bullish signal, indicating fresh money entering the market and increased conviction among traders. What’s Driving This Record Bitcoin Open Interest? According to insights shared by Cointelegraph and data from Glassnode, a major catalyst behind this surge is the introduction of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. These exchange-traded funds have opened up a new avenue for both institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. This influx of capital into the ecosystem naturally translates to higher activity in related derivatives markets, pushing open interest figures to new heights. Think of it this way: as more large players and traditional investors enter the space via ETFs, they often use derivatives for hedging, speculation, or complex trading strategies. This increased participation adds to the total number of open contracts, inflating the overall open interest number we’re seeing today. Exploring the Realized Cap Leverage Ratio Beyond just the raw open interest number, another crucial metric is the realized cap leverage ratio. Glassnode data indicates this ratio has climbed to 10.2%. Now, what does that mean in plain English? The realized cap leverage ratio compares the total open interest to the realized capitalization of Bitcoin. Realized cap values each Bitcoin at the price it was last moved on-chain. It’s often seen as a more accurate measure of the network’s true value held by long-term holders compared to market capitalization, which uses the current price for all coins. A higher realized cap leverage ratio suggests that the amount of capital tied up in derivatives is significant relative to the underlying ‘realized’ value of Bitcoin held by investors. The current level of 10.2% places it in the top 10.8% of trading days since 2018. This historical context is important – it tells us that while not unprecedented, the current level of leverage in the system is relatively high compared to most periods over the last six years. Why Does High Leverage Matter for the Bitcoin Price? High crypto leverage can be a double-edged sword: Bullish Potential: When the market is moving upwards, high leverage amplifies gains. Traders with leveraged long positions profit significantly from small price increases, potentially adding fuel to the rally as positions stay open or are added to. The large pool of open interest can act as potential buying pressure if these leveraged long positions are confident and maintain their exposure. Increased Risk: This is where the other edge cuts. High leverage means positions are more sensitive to price swings. A sudden downturn can quickly lead to margin calls and forced liquidations. The Shadow of Liquidation Risk While high open interest and leverage can certainly boost upside potential for the Bitcoin price , they also significantly heighten the risk of cascading liquidations. This is a critical challenge to consider in the current market environment. Here’s how liquidation risk works: Traders open leveraged positions (e.g., betting on the price going up using borrowed funds). If the price moves against their position (e.g., starts to fall), their margin (collateral) can become insufficient to cover potential losses. Exchanges automatically close these positions to prevent losses exceeding the margin. This forced selling is a ‘liquidation’. A large number of liquidations happening rapidly can create a domino effect, pushing the price down further, triggering more liquidations, and leading to sharp, rapid declines – often called a ‘long squeeze’ if it’s primarily leveraged long positions being closed. Given the current high leverage levels, the market is arguably more susceptible to such a cascade event. A relatively modest price drop could potentially trigger a wave of selling pressure from forced liquidations, accelerating the decline. Putting It All Together: What Does This Mean for the Market? The surge in Bitcoin open interest to $96 billion, supported by the structural shift brought by Bitcoin ETFs and reflected in a high realized cap leverage ratio, paints a complex picture for the Bitcoin market . Key Insights: Increased Market Participation: The high open interest signals strong engagement from traders, likely fueled by new capital entering through ETFs. Potential for Volatility: The high leverage means that while upward movements could be amplified, the risk of sharp downward corrections due to liquidations is also elevated. Historical Context: While leverage is high relative to recent years, it’s important to compare it to previous market cycle peaks. Are we at levels seen just before major corrections, or is this a new paradigm driven by institutional entry? This requires careful analysis. Bullish Fuel vs. Bearish Trigger: The large pool of open contracts can act as potential buying power on dips or add momentum to rallies. However, it simultaneously represents a large pool of potentially vulnerable positions that could trigger a sell-off if the market turns. Actionable Insights: Manage Risk: Traders using leverage should be acutely aware of the increased liquidation risk . Setting stop-losses and managing position sizes are more critical than ever. Monitor Funding Rates: Positive funding rates in perpetual futures often indicate a bias towards long positions, which can increase the risk of a long squeeze if sentiment shifts. Watch for Price Catalysts: Given the coiled spring nature of a highly leveraged market, positive or negative news events could have amplified effects on the Bitcoin price . Long-Term View: For investors with a longer time horizon, short-term volatility driven by leverage might present buying opportunities, but understanding the potential for sharp drops is crucial. Comparing Leverage Levels: Is This Unprecedented? While the 10.2% realized cap leverage ratio is in the top 10.8% of trading days since 2018, it’s worth looking at historical peaks to gauge the potential impact. Previous periods of extremely high leverage have sometimes preceded significant price corrections. However, the market structure has also evolved significantly with the advent of spot ETFs and increased institutional participation. This makes direct comparisons challenging, but the historical data serves as a warning about the inherent risks of high leverage in any market. A table illustrating historical leverage peaks vs. current levels could be useful here, though creating a precise, dynamic table without live data is difficult. Conceptually, imagine columns for ‘Date’, ‘Realized Cap Leverage Ratio’, and ‘Subsequent Price Action (e.g., % change in next 30 days)’. This would visually highlight the correlation between high leverage and potential volatility. The Role of Bitcoin ETFs in Shaping Open Interest The launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs didn’t just bring new direct investment; it also integrated Bitcoin more deeply into traditional financial structures. This integration often involves the use of derivatives for various purposes, including: Hedging: Institutions holding physical Bitcoin (or equivalents via ETFs) might use futures or options to hedge against potential price drops. Arbitrage: Traders might exploit small price differences between the spot ETF price and futures prices using leveraged positions. Structured Products: The creation of more complex financial products built around Bitcoin can also contribute to derivative activity and open interest. This structural change suggests that a higher baseline of Bitcoin open interest might be the new normal compared to pre-ETF days, but the risks associated with high leverage still apply. Concluding Thoughts: Navigating the Leveraged Landscape The current state of Bitcoin open interest , sitting near record highs at $96 billion and accompanied by elevated crypto leverage , presents a fascinating and potentially volatile market scenario. The bullish narrative is strong, fueled by continued ETF inflows and positive sentiment, suggesting the potential for further upward movement in the Bitcoin price . However, the significant level of leverage simultaneously introduces substantial liquidation risk . A sudden market shock could trigger a rapid unwinding of positions, leading to a sharp price decline. For participants in the Bitcoin market , this environment demands careful attention to risk management. While the potential rewards are significant if the market continues its upward trajectory, the potential for rapid downside moves should not be underestimated. Keeping a close eye on market structure, funding rates, and overall sentiment is crucial for navigating this highly leveraged landscape successfully.

2025-06-21T12:05:08,"Raoul Pal Says Current Crypto Market Echoes 2017, Eyes Extended Bull Cycle into 2026","Crypto markets may be in the early stages of a longer-than-expected bull cycle, according to Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal. In a video released Thursday, Pal compared the current market structure to that of 2017, when Bitcoin steadily climbed throughout the year before exploding in value by December. He noted that while the pattern is “spookily similar,” macroeconomic factors suggest this cycle could extend further — potentially into 2026. Pal bases his forecast on his “business cycle score,” a macroeconomic model used to assess where the global economy stands. Currently, the score remains below 50, indicating that economic momentum is still building. “It generally takes a while to climb up,” he explained, adding that this delay could stretch the crypto bull market timeline. Weakening Dollar Points to Longer Crypto Upside Potential One of the major indicators supporting Pal’s outlook is the weakening U.S. dollar. Since January 1, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has dropped nearly 9%, now hovering around 98.77. Given the inverse correlation between crypto and the dollar , a continued decline in the greenback could further bolster Bitcoin’s appeal as both a speculative asset and a hedge against fiat devaluation. Bitcoin’s historical price data from 2017 supports Pal’s analogy. Starting the year at around $1,044, it reached $2,187 by the end of May and closed the year at $14,156 — a gain of over 1,200%. This pattern of gradual growth followed by an explosive Q4 rally mirrors what Pal sees in today’s market, although macro conditions may push the peak further out. He also noted that this cycle may resemble 2020 more than 2021, suggesting the current phase is still early in its growth curve. “The whole cycle got shifted because rates didn’t get adjusted, and the dollar moved sideways for a while,” Pal added. Middle East Bets Big on AI and Blockchain Another promising signal for the future of crypto, Pal said, comes from institutional interest in the Middle East. On a recent trip to the region, he spoke with Sovereign Wealth Funds and reported a strong, unified mandate across countries like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, and Bahrain. “The mandate is AI and blockchain,” Pal said. He emphasized that these nations are not only interested in holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset but are also planning to build government infrastructure using blockchain technology .

2025-06-21T11:57:28,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Volatility Surges – What Technical Price Levels Are Traders Watching?","Bitcoin (BTC) is back under pressure, sliding beneath a critical support zone at $104,000 as short-term technical indicators signal a potential bearish continuation. At the time of writing, BTC trades around $103,829, down over 2% in the last 24 hours. With 24-hour volume surging to $46.6 billion, volatility has returned, but price action remains indecisive. On the 2-hour chart, Bitcoin is trapped beneath a descending trendline and has failed to hold the 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $104,657. A bearish engulfing candle near the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement at $104,028 was quickly followed by a drop to the $103,000 range. MACD momentum has turned negative, with widening divergence between signal and MACD lines, suggesting a deepening selloff. Key Technical Levels: Resistance: $104,657 (EMA), $105,238 (Fib 0.5) Support: $103,000, then $102,499 and $101,437 MACD: Bearish crossover confirmed A bearish Bitcoin price prediction could occur if BTC closes below $103K with high volume, potentially leading to further declines toward $100,451. Semler’s 105K Bitcoin Bet Shows Institutional Confidence While short-term price action remains cautious, institutional confidence in Bitcoin appears to be strengthening. Semler Scientific announced plans to expand its Bitcoin holdings from 4,449 to 105,000 by 2027, and appointed BTC strategist Joe Burnett to oversee the effort. BIG MOVE: Semler Scientific is going all-in on $BTC , planning to boost its holdings from 3,808 to a whopping 105,000 BTC by 2027! They aim for 10,000 BTC by year-end and 42,000 by 2026. With a 287% yield, they’re riding the corporate Bitcoin wave! #Bitcoin #Crypto — ChainGPT AI Agent (@ChainGPTAI) June 20, 2025 Even amid Friday’s broader crypto pullback, Semler’s stock jumped 14%, underscoring investor enthusiasm for long-term accumulation strategies. According to the firm, their goal is to hold 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025, setting the tone for more corporate treasuries to follow. Although BTC remained largely unmoved by the announcement, these longer-term signals of demand may lay the groundwork for future price stability above $100,000. Regulation Looms as Fraud Spurs ATM Crackdown And then there was the Bitcoin ATM news in Texas where a sheriff took $32,000 from a crypto machine to help recover $25,000 stolen in a government impersonation scam. The story went viral, and now everyone’s talking about whether this will lead to stricter regulations on Bitcoin ATMs. Jasper County sheriff recovers $32K from Bitcoin ATM after local scam, sparking debate over crypto privacy and enforcement methods. #BitcoinATM #LawEnforcement https://t.co/iqtiwD9xZH — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 20, 2025 In 2024 alone, crypto ATM fraud has resulted in $246 million in losses. While this doesn’t mean Bitcoin is the problem, tighter oversight could limit retail crypto access and slow down transaction volume for a bit. At the macro level, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said interest rate cuts could come as early as July if labor markets get weaker. Lower rates are good for risk assets like Bitcoin, but so far, BTC is waiting for more confirmation. Summary: BTC trades near $103.8K as MACD turns bearish Semler Scientific plans to accumulate 105,000 BTC Texas Bitcoin ATM raid triggers debate over retail access Fed rate cut speculation builds, but BTC holds steady As volatility climbs, traders are closely watching $103,000. A break below could set the stage for retests of $101,437 or even $100,451.

2025-06-21T11:49:20,"Nakamoto Holdings Raises $51.5M in 72 Hours to Buy More Bitcoin!","The post Nakamoto Holdings Raises $51.5M in 72 Hours to Buy More Bitcoin! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Backed by Trump’s crypto advisor David Bailey, Nakamoto Holdings has secured $51.5 million in lightning-fast funding—fueling its bold Bitcoin treasury ambitions. Investor Frenzy Sends Bitcoin Treasury Play into Overdrive Nakamoto Holdings, a rising Bitcoin treasury firm led by U.S. President Trump’s crypto advisor David Bailey, has raised $51.5 million via a PIPE (private investment in public equity) round. The deal was confirmed by merger partner KindlyMD and priced at $5.00 per share, completed in under 72 hours. “Investor interest in Nakamoto is exceptionally high,” said Bailey . “We’re staying focused on raising capital to buy as much Bitcoin as possible.” This latest round brings KindlyMD’s total funding to $563 million, and with convertible notes, the merged entity now commands $763 million in capital—setting the stage for Nakamoto’s aggressive BTC buying spree. Building a Bitcoin Treasury Powerhouse Nakamoto Holdings aims to rival giants like MicroStrategy and Europe’s Blockchain Group, which recently added $20 million in Bitcoin to its $170 million stash. The newly raised funds will primarily go toward Bitcoin acquisitions, with the remainder covering business operations. The move aligns with Nakamoto’s pending merger with Nasdaq-listed KindlyMD, set to close in Q3 2025. Merger Unlocks Bitcoin-Native Financial Innovation Following shareholder approval last month, KindlyMD’s merger with Nakamoto will give rise to a Bitcoin-focused financial entity—designed to build Bitcoin-native businesses through equity, debt instruments, and strategic investments. The momentum comes as 27 companies added BTC to their balance sheets, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET—signaling a wave of corporate Bitcoin adoption . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Demand Momentum Shows Bears Are Giving Up – Price Reversal Ahead? , Risks Remain in a Volatile Market Despite the bullish narrative, not all analysts are convinced.

Bollinger Bands are narrowing, hinting at a potential breakout. RSI at 44.5 suggests mild bearish pressure but also a chance for reversal. According to our Ethereum short-term price prediction, if ETH reclaims the 20-day SMA at $2,563, it could target $2,750. However, a drop below $2,357 may drag it to $2,200. For June 2025, ETH is likely to range between $2,400 and $2,600 , with a bullish bias on reclaiming key levels. High Price : $2,750 Low Price : $2,200 Average Price : $2,450 Ethereum Price Prediction 2025 Ethereum price has been trading in a symmetric triangle pattern since early 2021, a breakout could lead to the ETH coin price smashing the $5k mark and hitting a new all-time high of $5,925.

2025-06-21T11:30:49,"Pundit Claims BlackRock Has Two Special Dates For XRP Holders, Legal Expert Reacts","A recent claim by crypto influencer Bale has reignited speculative chatter within the XRP community after he alleged that a contact at BlackRock privately shared two key dates tied to XRP’s future. While the post was vague and lacked verifiable detail, it prompted immediate attention and skepticism from XRP holders and legal experts alike. Bale’s Bold Claim Sparks Buzz Bale’s post read: “So I met my guy from BlackRock in NYC for a coffee. He gave me 2 new XRP dates to watch. Adoption is coming.” Though not the first time the influencer has made such insinuations, this latest statement comes at a sensitive time for XRP, with heightened expectations surrounding institutional interest and regulatory clarity. The reference to “two new XRP dates” sparked a flurry of speculation among retail investors, many of whom remain hopeful that financial giants like BlackRock could eventually integrate XRP into their digital asset strategies. However, Bale offered no evidence, context, or timeline, fueling doubt about the authenticity of his claim. Only after he swore you to the code of silence surely? https://t.co/rVk43Rrw4F — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 21, 2025 Bill Morgan Responds with Sarcasm Legal expert Bill Morgan, widely respected in the XRP community for his grounded analysis of the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit, swiftly weighed in on the post. In a sardonic response, Morgan wrote, “Only after he swore you to the code of silence, surely?”—a pointed jab at the cryptic nature of Bale’s message. Morgan’s reply wasn’t merely humorous; it highlighted a recurring issue in crypto circles—unsubstantiated claims from influencers that lack transparency or factual grounding. As someone who has consistently advocated for legal accuracy over hype, Morgan’s tone reflected the increasing frustration among informed XRP supporters. Community Reactions: Support for Morgan, Scrutiny for Bale The XRP community, often dubbed the “XRP Army” reacted swiftly, with many praising Morgan’s stance. One user, xrp-dan, noted: “He’s posted this a few times.” Morgan, in agreement, replied: “Few too many times,” signaling a broader concern over repetitive, baseless claims. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another user, Mars0634, applauded Morgan for calling out misinformation, saying: “Brilliant Bill pulling up the many lies posted on X about XRP by these so-called influencers. Love it, keep it up.” Meanwhile, Guy Schiefelbein offered a more neutral perspective: “Arr you got to give it to Bale for being consistent.” The overall sentiment leaned toward skepticism, with many users reinforcing the need for credible updates rather than recycled promises. No Evidence of BlackRock Involvement with XRP Despite Bale’s assertion, there is no public record or official statement linking BlackRock to any direct interest in XRP. While BlackRock has explored tokenization, launched a Bitcoin ETF, and shown broader interest in digital assets, it has not announced any XRP-specific initiatives. In the absence of concrete evidence, such speculative posts serve only to inflate expectations and mislead new investors. Ripple vs. SEC: The Real Dates to Watch As XRP’s price and adoption outlook remain closely tied to regulatory outcomes, the most significant dates for the community right now lie within the courtroom. A decision on the final remedies, potentially including fines and injunctive relief, is expected soon. This outcome may directly affect Ripple’s business operations and the standing of XRP in the U.S. market. Until then, legal clarity, not influencer speculation, remains the most reliable signal for XRP’s institutional trajectory.

2025-06-21T11:30:36,"XRP Profit-Taking From 300% Green Whales Has Paused—But For How Long?","On-chain data shows the XRP investors with more than 300% in profits took part in a significant amount of selling earlier in the month. XRP Whales With Over 300% Gains Are Calm For Now In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the trend in the Realized Profit for a specific part of the Bitcoin network. The “ Realized Profit ” refers to a metric that measures, as its name already implies, the total amount of profit that the BTC investors as a whole are realizing through their selling. The indicator works by going through the transaction history of each token being sold on the blockchain to see what price it was moved at prior to this. If this previous selling price for any coin is less than the spot price that it’s now being sold at, then that particular token’s sale is leading to a realization of some net profit equal to the difference between the two values. The Realized Profit takes this difference for all profit-taking transactions and calculates their total sum to determine the situation for the network as a whole. Another indicator known as the Realized Loss tracks the sales of the opposite type. In the context of the current topic, the Realized Loss for the entire market isn’t of interest, but rather that of only a very specific portion of it: the XRP investors carrying gains of more than 300%. The only holders who would be in a profit of this level are those that bought the cryptocurrency prior to the asset’s explosion in November 2024. Thus, the Realized Profit of the cohort tells us about the level of profit-taking that these early buyers are participating in. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the indicator over the last couple of years: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP Realized Profit associated with investors carrying a profit margin of more than 300% saw a very sharp spike just after the initial price rally. This suggests that many of these early buyers didn’t wait too much to harvest their gains. Profit-taking from the group continued in early parts of 2025, although the spikes that the indicator witnessed were of a significantly smaller scale. After March, though, selling from these investors finally calmed down. From the chart, it’s apparent that this calm continued until this month, but the cohort ended up breaking its silence. “In early June, they began realizing profits at a pace of $68.8M per day (7D-SMA), signaling a wave of distribution by early holders,” notes Glassnode. So far since this selling spree, things have calmed down for the XRP Realized Profit of the cohort once more, but considering that these holders have taken part in selling on a few occasions already, it’s uncertain whether this means selling pressure has become exhausted or not. XRP Price XRP has faced a drop of more than 2% in the last 24 hours that has brought its price back to the $2.1 level.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-profit-taking-300-green-whales-paused-how-long/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","XRP|XRP Profit Taking|XRP Profits|XRP Whales|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare

For those tracking the pulse of the Crypto Market , understanding such macroeconomic discussions is crucial, as they often provide insights into the potential flow of capital and investor sentiment. Let’s break down Trump’s statement and explore its possible implications for the broader US Economy and digital assets. What Did Trump Say About Interest Rates ? In a post on Truth Social, Donald Trump asserted that if Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell were to lower benchmark Interest Rates to a range of 1% to 2%, the United States government could realize annual savings of up to $1 trillion. This bold claim ties the direct cost of government borrowing to the Fed’s monetary policy decisions. Trump also used the statement as an opportunity to criticize the current administration, attributing what he sees as high costs to the policies enacted under President Biden. His remarks position the lowering of Interest Rates not just as an economic adjustment but as a significant fiscal maneuver with substantial savings potential. How Do the Federal Reserve’s Actions Influence the US Economy ? The Federal Reserve , often referred to as the ‘Fed’, is the central banking system of the United States. Its primary tool for influencing the US Economy is setting the target range for the federal funds rate – the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight borrowing. This rate serves as a benchmark that influences other interest rates throughout the economy, including: Rates on mortgages and car loans Interest earned on savings accounts and bonds Borrowing costs for businesses The cost of government debt When the Fed lowers Interest Rates , it typically aims to stimulate economic activity by making borrowing cheaper, encouraging spending and investment. Conversely, raising rates is intended to cool down an overheating economy and combat inflation by making borrowing more expensive. Trump’s argument centers on the government’s own borrowing costs. The U.S. government issues Treasury bonds and other debt instruments to finance its operations and existing debt. The interest paid on this debt is a significant government expense. Lowering market Interest Rates generally leads to lower yields on newly issued government debt, potentially reducing the government’s annual interest payments, which is the basis for Trump’s $1 trillion savings claim. Could Lower Interest Rates Really Save $1 Trillion? The potential savings figure cited by Trump is substantial and depends on several factors, including the total amount of outstanding government debt, the average maturity of that debt, and the speed at which lower rates would translate into lower borrowing costs for new or refinanced debt. Here’s a simplified look at the concept: The U.S. national debt is currently in the tens of trillions of dollars. A portion of this debt matures regularly and must be refinanced by issuing new debt. If the prevailing Interest Rates are lower when new debt is issued, the interest payments on that new debt will be lower. Over time, as more high-interest debt matures and is replaced by lower-interest debt, the total annual interest expense could decrease significantly. However, reaching a $1 trillion annual saving depends on a rapid and sustained drop in borrowing costs across a vast amount of debt. Economists have varying estimates on the potential savings from lower rates, and $1 trillion is generally considered to be at the higher end of projections, potentially requiring a more significant and prolonged rate reduction than the 1-2% target range mentioned by Trump, or assuming a very rapid turnover of existing debt. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve’s decisions are based on its dual mandate: achieving maximum employment and stable prices (controlling inflation). While the impact on government borrowing costs is a consideration, it is not the primary driver of monetary policy. The Fed must weigh the potential benefits of lower rates (like reduced government interest expense and economic stimulation) against the risks, particularly the risk of fueling inflation, which could ultimately harm the US Economy . What is the Potential Crypto Market Impact? Discussions around Interest Rates and the US Economy are closely watched by participants in the Crypto Market . Here’s why: Risk-On Sentiment: Lower interest rates typically make traditional, safer investments like bonds less attractive due to lower yields. This can encourage investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets, including stocks and cryptocurrencies. This is often referred to as a ‘risk-on’ environment. Liquidity: When the Fed lowers rates or engages in quantitative easing (another monetary tool), it generally increases the overall liquidity in the financial system. More money flowing through the economy can find its way into various asset classes, including crypto. Inflation Hedges: While the Fed’s goal with higher rates has been to combat inflation, some investors view assets like Bitcoin as a potential hedge against currency devaluation, especially if expansive monetary policies (like very low rates) are pursued over long periods. Comparison to Traditional Finance: As interest rates rise, the cost of capital increases for businesses, potentially slowing growth. For speculative assets like many cryptocurrencies, a lower-rate environment can make their potential future value more appealing compared to the lower returns offered elsewhere. If the Federal Reserve were to significantly lower Interest Rates towards the 1-2% range suggested by Trump , many analysts would anticipate this being a bullish signal for the Crypto Market , assuming other economic factors remain stable. Cheaper borrowing could also potentially free up capital for institutional or individual investors to allocate to digital assets. Navigating Economic Statements: Actionable Insights For those involved in the Crypto Market , keeping an eye on macroeconomic indicators and political commentary is important, but it’s crucial to approach them with a critical perspective. Distinguish Policy from Proposal: Trump’s statement is a proposal and a critique, not current Fed policy. The Fed operates independently and makes decisions based on complex economic data, not political directives. Understand the ‘Why’: Consider the context and potential motivations behind political statements on the economy. Focus on Fed Communication: Pay closer attention to official statements and minutes from the Federal Reserve ‘s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings for actual policy direction. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: While a significant shift in Interest Rates could have long-term implications for the Crypto Market , short-term market movements are influenced by a vast array of factors, including regulation, technological developments, and market sentiment specific to crypto. Do Your Own Research: Economic forecasts and the impact of policy are complex and subject to change. Rely on diverse sources of information and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions based on macroeconomic predictions. While the prospect of $1 trillion in savings is a headline-grabbing figure, the path to achieving it through significantly lower Interest Rates involves intricate economic trade-offs that the Federal Reserve must navigate carefully to ensure the long-term health of the US Economy . The reaction of the Crypto Market to any such policy shift would be just one piece of the larger economic puzzle. Summary Donald Trump has put forward the idea that lowering Federal Reserve Interest Rates to 1-2% could save the US Economy $1 trillion annually, while also criticizing current policy. While lower rates can indeed reduce government borrowing costs and historically tend to favor risk-on assets like those in the Crypto Market , the Fed’s decisions are driven by broader economic mandates like employment and inflation control. The potential savings figure is significant but depends on many variables. For crypto enthusiasts, this serves as a reminder that macroeconomic policy is a key factor to monitor, but official Fed actions and a comprehensive understanding of economic dynamics are more reliable indicators than political statements alone.

2025-06-21T11:19:59,"Wall Street Is Missing Coinbase's Leverage To The Next Supercycle (Rating Upgrade)","Summary Coinbase's stablecoin revenue has grown considerably in recent years. With institutional adoption on the horizon, the stock has considerable exposure to a new kind of institutional investment cycle, one focused on crypto's payment rails. Trading at only 18x Adjusted EBITDA, (as a run-rate) we think the stock appears quite reasonably priced. We're upgrading COIN to a 'Strong Buy'. Over the last few years, we've put out a number of articles on Coinbase ( COIN ), consistently calling the stock a ' Buy ': Seeking Alpha This is due to the fact that we see the crypto space growing in importance over the next decade, as the ecosystem's overall size, functionality, and accessibility begin to rival the traditional financial system. In the past, part of our bullish thesis has centered around Coinbase’s exposure to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Bitcoin trading volumes, which have historically made up a large portion of the firm's revenues. It shouldn’t be a surprise, then, that the stock has correlated strongly with Bitcoin's price since IPO: TradingView However, as stablecoin legislation makes its way through US Congress, and we see increased interest from 'traditional' companies in the space, we think the next crypto cycle is already taking shape. In the past, we’ve seen speculative frenzies dominated by meme coins, NFTs, and a fixation on both Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), perhaps to the exclusion of all else. Now, as decentralized finance apps and stablecoins begin to offer the world new payment rails for stable value exchange, we think COIN's services revenue will begin generating a majority of appreciation for shareholders going forward. Over the last few years, Coinbase has done an excellent job at cutting costs and diversifying its revenue base. Now, with the potential for massively increased institutional adoption, we think COIN's non-transaction revenues will power the stock's next leg higher. It’s true that COIN is expensive on some metrics, but when you break it down, we actually think the market is asking a reasonable price from investors. Today , we'll dive into the company's recent results, explain why we think COIN's diversified revenue should bolster margins and growth, and reiterate the case that we think Coinbase is 'one to own' for the years ahead. Sound good? Let’s dive in. Financials Our last coverage of Coinbase was in October of last year, and so before we dive into the recent updates that have reinforced our bullish view, it’s probably worth covering some of the recent numbers, just to get a sense of where the stock currently sits. In Q4 of 2024, Coinbase reported revenues of $2.27 billion, which represented 138% year-over-year growth. Similarly, the company reported earnings per share of ~$4.68, which came in well above analyst estimates. By all counts, this was a strong corner. In Q1 of 2025, results were a bit weaker, with revenue actually down sequentially, although still up 24% YoY. EPS also missed by quite a large margin: Seeking Alpha However, when you zoom out, much of this EPS volatility has to do with the company's 'Fair Value' mark of its crypto holdings. If you look at Coinbase from a cash perspective, the firm appears to be in a much stronger operating position. Once you strip out depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and gains and losses from the crypto portfolio, adjusted EBITDA for Q1 of this year was down only very slightly YoY, from $1.02 billion to $930 million: 10Q This reflects gaining momentum in the company's EBITDA, which has now — for several quarters — earned at roughly a $1 billion run rate. Annualize this, and Coinbase as a firm — subject to some volatility and trading revenues — is producing roughly $4 billion a year in adjusted EBITDA. Not bad! With some stocks, using adjusted EBITDA can be a tricky measure, but given that the majority of Coinbase's adjustments are correcting for crypto portfolio fluctuations, we think it’s actually a relatively fair representation of what’s going on, 'on the ground'. Frankly, when we first started covering the stock back in May 2023, Coinbase was just turning the corner on revenue diversification and cost-cutting. Now, two years on, the firm is pumping out solid, consistent adjusted EBITDA off the back of a diversified revenue base at the center of the regulated crypto ecosystem. We expect the company to continue making gains as institutional adoption increases. Recently, we’ve seen a number of headlines that bolster our view that increased institutional adoption is on the way. This week, the US Senate recently voted for and passed a bill giving much stronger legal footing to the stablecoin market. This is a big deal, especially considering the bill's bipartisan support. Now, with the stroke of a pen, Donald Trump could turn whatever final bill lands on his desk into a cohesive outline for how modern businesses can actually use crypto payment rails and free themselves from oppressive credit card fees. Additionally, as this legislation has advanced, we’ve seen comments from major retailers like Walmart ( WMT ) and Amazon ( AMZN ) that they’re looking into using crypto payment rails and stablecoins to reduce payment friction and increase profitability. CFOs at other companies may begin seeing the potential benefits of using stablecoins, and we expect Coinbase to garner a majority of this business. Revenue-wise, Coinbase is well-prepared to monetize this opportunity. The company is known for its retail and institutional trading platforms and brokerage capability, but COIN's revenue streams have now diversified to the point that in Q1 of this year, 35% of revenue came from stablecoins, blockchain rewards, interest, and subscription revenues from programs like 'Coinbase One': Seeking Alpha As we see it, COIN has numerous levers to grow from both traditional routes and increased institutional crypto adoption, and the stock should move beyond how many currently on Wall Street see it — as an underperforming Bitcoin wrapper. Valuation So, COIN's financials have improved, and we think the firm has considerable upside in the event of increased crypto adoption through its service offerings. Why does the stock look so expensive? In short, by some metrics, COIN is trading at a heightened multiple. You can see this in the stock's price-to-sales ratio, which stands at around 11x: TradingView There’s no doubt that this is high, both relative to the past , and nominally vs. the market . However, if you look at the company, Coinbase sports considerable operating margins—at least once you strip out the net income fluctuations from the crypto portfolio. In Q1, the firm produced $2 billion in revenue and $930 million in adjusted EBITDA. This is a nearly 50% cash margin. Not only that, but COIN is now producing roughly $4 billion in adjusted EBITDA, with a market cap of $75.2 billion. Broken down like this, the stock is actually trading at an 18x multiple. This appears MUCH more reasonable. We would argue that for a company that has so much potential upside, to such a large potential shift in the way this financial system works, paying 18x adjusted EBITDA appears like an incredibly fair price. Again, if you look at Seeking Alpha's valuation grade of Coinbase, you’ll find the stock's multiples look quite high versus the financial sector: Seeking Alpha In fact, the stock earns an 'F' rating. That said, many of these numbers are skewed dramatically by the 'Fair Value' fluctuations. Additionally, the company's lumpy results and uncertain growth catalyst timings make the stock look expensive. If Coinbase manages to continue growing EBITDA into the future, we think a purchase today at under $300 per share could be incredibly advantageous for investors. When you add up COIN's significant leverage to the next potential crypto cycle along with the diversity of revenue sources, high margins, and relatively attractive price point, we think the stock looks like a 'Strong Buy'. Risks Of course, when it comes to Coinbase, there are some risks to consider. First and foremost, many of COIN's revenues come from transaction fees from retail users. These still make up the lion's share of revenue. This means that a protracted lack of interest in the crypto ecosystem would also likely have a negative impact on Coinbase's revenue picture. This is what we saw in 2021. However, management has — as we mentioned — taken steps to reduce reliance on trading revenues, which, we think, makes the stock appear more well-prepared for an inevitable future slowdown. Additionally, many of the assets that trade on Coinbase’s platform remain without a regulatory framework. This presents a considerable regulatory risk for Coinbase. The stablecoin news is welcome but make no mistake — regulatory risk remains as Coinbase continues to offer altcoins that have (frankly) questionable status as securities. Management has done an excellent job navigating the regulatory storm in the past, but we think that’s possible that risks here could flare back up. This would likely ding the stock, at least in the short term. Summary Overall, though, we think COIN is incredibly well-prepared to capitalize on the next crypto cycle in a way that it hasn’t been able to before. With increased exposure to stablecoin revenues, reduced regulatory risk, and continued EBITDA margin strength, we think Coinbase's organic performance has a great trajectory. Coupled with a multiple that we think appears very reasonable, it’s hard to see the stock as anything other than a ' Strong Buy '. Thus, our rating.

The claims came after co-founder Jaz Gulati posted a snapshot of Garden’s Dune Analytics dashboard on X, boasting that it had collected $300,000 in fees over 12 days. ZachXBT responded to the post, bashing Garden of supporting Chinese-based laundering operations that helped move funds stolen in the Bybit hack by the Lazarus Group. “ You conveniently left out >80% of your fees came from Chinese launderers moving Lazarus Group funds from the Bybit hack ,” he reckoned. “ Who are you building for again? ” Crypto security analyst questions dashboard data According to the Dune dashboard, as of June 19, Garden Finance had processed 24,984 BTC in total volume, equal to approximately $1.5 billion in USD value, through over 40,000 atomic swaps. The platform’s largest swap to date was 10 BTC, while total reported fees collected stood at 40.11 BTC. Responding to ZachXBT’s claims, Gulati argued that “30 BTC fees came before the hack even happened,” attaching a Discord screenshot dated October 24, 2024, showing roughly 30 BTC in fees. this is great analysis since 30 BTC fees came before the hack even happened pic.twitter.com/C6A5F3BLsd — Jaz 🌸 (@jzgulati) June 21, 2025 The on-chain sleuth noted that he hadn’t even mentioned funds from “other DPRK hacks yet, like WazirX,” bashing the DeFi protocol for failing to flag the hackers’ transactions. Bybit’s hack, which occurred on February 21, 2025, involved a breach of the exchange’s cold wallet. Nearly $1.5 billion in Ethereum was siphoned from user accounts after attackers compromised a developer working on SAFE Wallet, a platform used by Bybit customers, five days ahead of the exploit. Several analysts, including ZachXBT, traced the stolen funds to laundering networks operating through DeFi bridges to the Lazarus Group . Gulati lambasted the blockchain security analyst by saying he was speaking from a point of “misinformation.” ZachXBT then asked : “ Explain how it is ‘decentralized’ when I watched in real time for multiple days as a single entity kept topping up liquidity from Coinbase for the Chinese launderers as they continued moving Bybit funds? ” explain how it is “decentralized” when I watched in real time for multiple days as a single entity kept topping up cbBTC liquidity from Coinbase for the Chinese launderers as they continued moving Bybit funds? — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) June 21, 2025 The developer is yet to respond to the question. Who helped Lazarus in the $230 million WazirX hack? In his accusations against Gulati, ZachXBT talked about the attack on WazirX , an Indian crypto exchange, where the Lazarus Group reportedly stole more than $230 million in crypto. That hack, which took place on July 18, 2024, was executed through forged smart contract signatures used to bypass WazirX’s multisig wallet protections. Hackers drained funds within an hour of gaining access. Similar to the Bybit case, investigators traced the exploit to North Korea’s Lazarus Group. Authorities in Japan, the United States, and South Korea later issued a joint cybersecurity alert identifying similar tactics used across both attacks. The group reportedly used social engineering, phishing, TraderTraitor and AppleJeus malware to target developer workstations and compromise their infrastructure. Crypto stolen in both hacks was subsequently laundered across decentralized platforms, often using mixers to obscure transaction trails. Garden Finance’s dashboard shows there was a spike in Bitcoin swaps between May and June 2025, with individual daily volumes peaking near 90 transactions in wrapped Bitcoin assets. The chart lists swaps by chain-token combinations such as base-cbBTC, ethereum-WBTC, and arbitrum-WBTC, with base-cbBTC recording the highest usage statistics. cbBTC, a wrapped Bitcoin asset pegged to Coinbase BTC, was mentioned by ZachXBT in his attack on Garden Finance, propounding that the platform was party to the untraceable movements of illicit funds from DPRK hackers .

2025-06-21T10:48:28,"Raoul Pal says the current crypto cycle is like 2017","Crypto research platform Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal has said the current crypto cycle is very similar to the one that was witnessed in 2017. According to Pal, Bitcoin posted a steady uptrend all through the year before skyrocketing towards the end of the year. The Real Vision CEO gave his verdict via a video, where he said, “It’s spookily similar to 2017.” Pal also said he is beginning to see a longer crypto cycle, forecasting that it might take a while this time around given the business cycle score. The business cycle score, according to Pal, is a macroeconomic model he uses to track the position of the global economy in the broader cycle. He added that it is still below 50 and it generally “takes a while to climb up.” Raoul Pal sees similarities in the current and 2017 crypto market cycle According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin started trading around $1,044 at the beginning of 2017, before rising to around $2,187 by May 31. The premier digital asset went on to close the year at $14,156, signifying a massive rise of 1,255% from the price at the beginning of the year. While Pal predicts the same movement, he acknowledges that a weaker US dollar could indicate a slower crypto cycle, which means it will take time before it reaches its peak. “With the dollar breaking down even today, it’s starting to suggest this may go into Q2 2026,” he said. Since the beginning of the year, the US Dollar Index has been down 8.995, sitting at 98.77 at the time of writing, according to data from TradingView. Bitcoin and DXY are inversely correlated. This means that when the dollar weakens, Bitcoin becomes more attractive not just as a speculative investment but as an alternative currency. Pal also added that macroeconomic data has been a primary reason why the crypto cycle has always shifted further back. “It’s like the whole cycle got shifted cause rates didn’t get adjusted; the dollar was sideways for some time,” he said. He also said that the current market may show signs of looking like the market in 2020 more than the one in 2021, suggesting that it could be at an earlier growth phase than many are predicting. Bitcoin began 2020 at $7,174, but dropped by 27% in March to $5,227. The asset then rebounded 129% to hit $11,990 in August, before witnessing a 304% increase, ending the year at $28,993. Pal added that the market needs to continue expanding to attract big players. He discussed his recent trip to the Middle East where he met with Sovereign Wealth Funds, adding that most of them were bullish on crypto. “The mandate across the entire region, from Saudi to Abu Dhabi to Dubai to Bahrain to Qatar, is AI and blockchain,” he said. He also added that things should evolve past just seeing Bitcoin as a reserve asset, noting that nations need to start building their entire government infrastructure on blockchain. Global governments have been making moves in the crypto sector since the beginning of the year. A typical example is Pakistan, with the country looking for ways to create a draft bill that could be passed in the near future to regulate digital assets. In addition, the country plans to formulate regulations that will protect its investors and attract global players into its digital asset hub.

Public companies now hold over 777,000 BTC—worth nearly $80.6 billion—and South Korea is jumping in. Parataxis Holdings has officially announced plans to create South Korea’s first publicly traded Bitcoin treasury company, signaling a bold shift in corporate crypto adoption across Asia. Parataxis Acquires Bridge Bio to Launch BTC Treasury Arm In a strategic move, Parataxis Holdings will acquire a controlling stake in biotech firm Bridge Bio for $18.5 million, according to the latest reports. After the acquisition, Bridge Bio will be renamed Parataxis Korea and will function as a Bitcoin-focused treasury company. The company confirmed the plan via press release , marking a historic first for South Korea. Inspired by MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Playbook Parataxis is following the path blazed by MicroStrategy , the most prominent public company holding Bitcoin. The firm, led by Michael Saylor, holds 592,100 BTC—valued at over $61.4 billion. Parataxis partner Andrew Kim revealed that the move is inspired by success stories like MicroStrategy and Asia’s Metaplanet, which holds 10,000 BTC. Kim emphasized Bitcoin’s long-term potential for shareholders and national economic value. Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Gains Steam in Korea Despite South Korea’s strict crypto regulations —such as the ban on spot Bitcoin ETFs —momentum for corporate adoption is building: A 2025 pilot program allows 3,500 companies to open verified crypto accounts. Lawmakers are pushing for spot crypto ETFs and won-backed stablecoins by next year. Parataxis CEO Edward Chin said the Bitcoin strategy is designed to benefit both investors and the nation. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Demand Momentum Shows Bears Are Giving Up – Price Reversal Ahead? , Top Public Companies Holding Bitcoin Here are the top public companies by BTC holdings: MicroStrategy – 592,100 BTC (~$61.4B) Marathon Digital – 16,930 BTC Riot Platforms – 8,872 BTC Metaplanet (Japan) – 10,000 BTC Boyaa Interactive (Hong Kong) and DDC Enterprise (China) also hold significant Bitcoin reserves.

2025-06-21T10:30:29,"Spot Crypto ETF Approval: Analyst Predicts Massive 90%+ Chance","BitcoinWorld Spot Crypto ETF Approval: Analyst Predicts Massive 90%+ Chance Exciting news is circulating in the cryptocurrency world, suggesting that a significant breakthrough for mainstream adoption might be just around the corner. A prominent voice in financial analysis has weighed in on the likelihood of a spot crypto ETF finally making its way to market, and their outlook is overwhelmingly positive. This development could pave the way for easier access to digital assets for both institutional and retail investors. What Are the Current ETF Approval Odds ? According to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart , the chances of seeing most spot crypto ETF applications receive the green light are remarkably high. Seyffart recently took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to share his analysis, asserting a confidence level exceeding 90% for the approval of these products. This figure represents a significant shift in sentiment compared to past years when such approvals seemed like a distant possibility. The analyst’s assessment provides a strong indicator of the growing maturity of the crypto market and the increasing inevitability of regulated investment products. Why Is Increased Communication with the SEC Approval a Positive Sign? A key factor contributing to Seyffart’s optimistic forecast is the noticeable increase in communication between asset managers applying for the ETFs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Historically, the SEC has been cautious, citing concerns around market manipulation, investor protection, and the nascent nature of the crypto markets. However, the recent engagement suggests a more constructive dialogue is taking place. This enhanced communication indicates that the SEC may be actively working through the concerns and technical details necessary for approving these complex financial products. It signals progress towards finding common ground and establishing the necessary regulatory frameworks. Navigating the Path to Crypto ETF Approval The journey towards crypto ETF approval in the United States has been a long and often frustrating one. While futures-based Bitcoin ETFs have been approved and are trading, a spot ETF, which holds the underlying asset directly, has remained elusive. Many believe a spot ETF offers a more direct and potentially less complex investment vehicle for investors. The SEC’s previous rejections have often centered on surveillance-sharing agreements and concerns about the unregulated nature of underlying crypto exchanges. The increased communication noted by James Seyffart likely involves addressing these specific regulatory hurdles and establishing robust investor safeguards. Insights from James Seyffart on Timing While the probability of approval is high, the exact timing remains uncertain, according to James Seyffart . He stated, “Could be something we’re talking about in the next month or two. Or it could be something that waits until October or later. Matter of when not if.” This perspective suggests that while the regulatory wheels are turning, the process still involves significant steps and potential delays. Investors and market participants should prepare for potential outcomes ranging from near-term approvals to those happening later in the year. The focus, as Seyffart highlights, should be on the strong likelihood of approval rather than fixating on a precise date. Understanding the Potential Impact of a Spot Crypto ETF The approval of a spot crypto ETF is widely seen as a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency market. Here are some potential impacts: Increased Institutional Investment: ETFs provide a familiar, regulated, and easily accessible structure for large financial institutions, pension funds, and wealth managers to gain exposure to crypto without directly holding the assets. Enhanced Retail Access: Investing in crypto through a traditional brokerage account via an ETF is simpler for many retail investors than setting up crypto exchange accounts and managing private keys. Market Legitimacy: Regulatory approval from the SEC lends significant credibility to the crypto asset class, potentially attracting more conservative investors. Potential Price Impact: Increased demand from new investor classes could positively impact the price of the underlying cryptocurrencies. Improved Liquidity: A successful ETF can add significant trading volume and liquidity to the market. However, potential challenges exist, including market volatility, concentration risk in specific assets, and the influence of large fund flows on price dynamics. Conclusion: High Probability, Uncertain Timeline The analysis shared by Bloomberg’s James Seyffart offers a compelling outlook for the future of cryptocurrency investments. The assertion of a 90%+ chance for widespread crypto ETF approval , driven by improved dialogue with the SEC, paints a picture of regulatory acceptance becoming a reality. While the specific timeline for these approvals remains fluid, the message is clear: it appears to be a question of ‘when,’ not ‘if.’ This development holds the potential to unlock significant new capital and mainstream participation in the crypto market, marking a pivotal moment for the industry.

2025-06-21T10:23:59,"Crypto Dip As Trump Says Iran’s Leader An ‘Easy Target’ But This DeFi Token Is Defying Odds","The post Crypto Dip As Trump Says Iran’s Leader An ‘Easy Target’ But This DeFi Token Is Defying Odds appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is reeling after President Donald Trump’s provocative claim that Iran’s leader is an “easy target,” sparking a sharp decline in major coins. Bitcoin dropped from $104,310 to $103,553 within an hour, while Ether and XRP fell 1.3% each. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index slid to “Neutral,” reflecting shaken investor confidence. Geopolitical tensions, intensified by recent Israel-Iran clashes, fuel this uncertainty. Yet, amidst this turmoil, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is defying odds, drawing attention as a promising defi crypto. Its presale, now in phase 5, has raised $10,900,000, with over 560 million tokens sold to 12,300 holders. Investors are flocking to this rising star. Bitcoin’s Stumble Amid Tensions Trump’s bold statement on Truth Social, hinting at Iran’s supreme leader’s vulnerability, sent shockwaves through crypto prices. Bitcoin, hovering above $105,000, briefly dipped below $104,000 before recovering slightly. Analysts warn it may test the $100,000 mark soon, with some predicting a drop to $93,000. The crypto fear and greed index, now at 52, signals caution among traders. This isn’t Trump’s first market jolt; his tariff policies earlier in 2025 also rattled investors. Consequently, many are questioning if crypto investment remains viable. Despite this, one project stands resilient, offering hope in a turbulent market. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing investor focus with its phase 5 presale underway at $0.03 per token, a 200% rise from phase one’s $0.01. The project has secured $10,900,000, with 12,300 holders owning over 560 million tokens. Phase 6 looms, bringing a 16.7% price hike to $0.035. At launch, MUTM will list at $0.06, guaranteeing a 100% return for current buyers. Moreover, analysts project a post-launch value of $2.50, suggesting an 8,233% gain from today’s price. This defi crypto’s momentum is undeniable, fueled by its innovative lending platform. Investors are taking note of its potential. Innovative Lending Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) redefines crypto investing with its dual lending system. Its Peer-to-Contract model lets users deposit stablecoins into smart contracts, earning passive income while enabling instant borrowing.

2025-06-21T10:23:58,"Crypto Bull Run Alert: Altcoins Set for 10x to 20x Gains in Q3","The post Crypto Bull Run Alert: Altcoins Set for 10x to 20x Gains in Q3 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The entire crypto market is tumbling under rising geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty, pulling its valuation down to $3.2 trillion with a modest 1.10% dip in the past day. A sudden 42% spike in trading volume hints at panic moves, while the Fear & Greed Index sits at 43, marking a neutral but uneasy mood. Bitcoin is trading at $103,491, down 0.94% with a daily low of $102,372. Moreover, a 38% spike in volume to $50.25B signals heavy trading, but not clear bullish momentum. Despite the bearish clouds, a popular analyst, Nathan from Investing Made Simple, says the Bitcoin bull market is far from done, and the best is yet to come. In his latest video , he laid out three distinct models that all point to one target: a parabolic move to $200,000 or more by the end of 2025. Three Data-Backed Models Point $200K Target The analyst first broke down Bitcoin’s historical cycle returns, noting that after every bear market low, BTC typically experiences exponential growth . From the 2022 bottom of $15,500, a 10–15x return places the top somewhere between $140,000 and $210,000, in line with previous cycles, though slightly more conservative due to market maturity. The second method used Bitcoin’s last all-time high of $69,000 as a baseline, applying the common bull market pattern of 2–3x gains from that peak. Again, this results in a target range of $140,000 to $210,000. Finally, he introduced the Power Law Model, which tracks Bitcoin’s price trajectory against time using logarithmic growth. This model not only suggests a peak around $210,000 but also forecasts the final blow-off phase to occur between October and December 2025, similar to what we’ve seen in past cycles. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Demand Momentum Shows Bears Are Giving Up – Price Reversal Ahead? , Altcoins Could See Explosive Gains in Q3 While Bitcoin price may grab the headlines, the analyst emphasized that altcoins could be the real winners in the final leg of the bull market. Historically, the last quarter of a cycle, when Bitcoin enters its parabolic phase, is when altcoins truly explode, often outperforming BTC by several multiples. The analyst also hinted that top-tier altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche could deliver massive returns, especially if money flows from Bitcoin into more speculative assets, as it typically does near cycle tops. Even mid- and low-cap coins could rally 10x to 20x, but the analyst warns this phase is usually short-lived, sometimes lasting just a few weeks. He added that timing will be key, and investors sitting on the sidelines too long may miss out on the most profitable window of the entire cycle. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!
