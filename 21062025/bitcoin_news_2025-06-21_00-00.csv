2025-06-20T22:30:23,"Bitcoin Open Interest Drops 3.5% – More Pain Ahead?","Bitcoin has remained above the critical $100,000 level since early June, suggesting that the market may be establishing a new price equilibrium. Despite holding this psychological threshold, the bullish momentum has stalled as BTC struggles to break above its all-time high near $112,000. This consolidation phase is marked by indecision, with traders weighing macroeconomic uncertainty, global conflict, and the fading post-halving hype. Data from CryptoQuant provides deeper context into market dynamics, particularly in the derivatives sector. According to the firm, previous deep drawdowns in open interest (OI) — between 20% and 25% — typically accompanied local price corrections of 7% to 21% throughout 2024 and 2025. These sharp drops in OI often signal broad market repositioning or liquidation events that trigger downside volatility. Currently, the OI change stands at –3.5%, indicating only a moderate outflow of leveraged positions. While this does not raise immediate red flags, it does highlight cautious sentiment among futures traders. The muted drop in OI suggests that investors are trimming exposure but not exiting the market entirely — a sign that the current range-bound price action could persist until a more decisive catalyst emerges. Bitcoin Momentum Wanes As Open Interest Hints At Potential Risk Bitcoin is currently trading 6% below its all-time high of $112,000, showing impressive resilience amid global uncertainty but lacking the momentum needed to enter full price discovery. The market has held relatively stable above the $100,000 level, yet the inability to push higher reflects hesitation from both institutional and retail investors. Macro headwinds — including rising US Treasury yields, the Federal Reserve’s decision to hold interest rates, and escalating tensions in the Middle East — continue to influence risk sentiment and stall bullish continuation. According to top analyst Axel Adler , futures market data is beginning to signal cautious repositioning. In the 2024–2025 cycle, deep drawdowns in open interest (OI) between –20% and –25% consistently coincided with local Bitcoin corrections ranging from 7% to 21%. While current OI sits at just –3.5%, suggesting only a moderate reduction in positions, any repeat of the historical pattern could imply a potential BTC price correction of 5–15%. With BTC stuck between major resistance at $112K and key support near $103K, traders are watching derivatives activity closely. For now, the market remains balanced — but not immune to a sharp move if pressure builds. BTC Price Holds Tight Between Key Levels As Market Awaits Breakout Bitcoin is currently trading around $105,910, following a modest bounce within a tight consolidation range. This 3-day chart shows BTC caught between the $109,300 resistance zone and the $103,600 support level, which has now been tested multiple times since early June. Despite a slight uptick in volume, price action remains largely indecisive, reflecting market caution. The chart also highlights the significance of the 50-day (blue), 100-day (green), and 200-day (red) simple moving averages. All three trend indicators are sloping upward, with price consistently holding above them — a bullish structural signal. Notably, the 50-day SMA is currently acting as dynamic support near the $100K–$102K range. As long as BTC remains within this range, traders will look for a breakout above $109,300 to signal renewed bullish momentum and a potential push into price discovery. On the downside, a breakdown below $103,600 could open the door for a retest of the $95K–$98K region, where the 100-day SMA currently aligns.

2025-06-20T22:30:20,"Bitcoin Bullish Divergence That Appeared Before The May ATH Has Returned Again","Bitcoin is currently hovering in a tightly compressed price range after failing multiple times to break above $110,000 earlier this month. The past few days have been characterized by the leading cryptocurrency trading around $105,000, with neither bulls nor bears taking control. Despite the overall consolidation, a subtle yet significant signal is starting to flash beneath the surface, particularly on the 4-hour chart, that might send Bitcoin to a new all-time high soon. Return Of Rare Divergence Pattern On Bitcoin’s 4H Chart Crypto analyst Luca (@CrypticTrades_) took to social media platform X to share a chart that highlights an important technical development on Bitcoin’s 4-hour timeframe: the return of a bullish divergence. This signal, which previously appeared in early April, preceded the massive rally that catapulted Bitcoin to its May 22 all-time high of $111,800. The same divergence is forming once again and another Bitcoin price breakout may be very close. Related Reading: Why The Bitcoin Price Could See Another 70%-170% Jump From Here As shown in the 4-hour candlestick timeframe chart below, the divergence is clearly illustrated between price action and the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Price has been forming lower lows, while the RSI has been printing higher lows. This mismatch serves as an early indicator that selling momentum is fading, and a reversal to the upside could follow. The previous instance of this pattern directly preceded a sharp move from a $74,000 low in early April to above $111,000 in just a few weeks. What Does This Divergence Mean For Bitcoin’s Price? Bullish divergences on mid-timeframe charts like the 4-hour have a reputation for being the first reversal signals when supported by rising volume. In Bitcoin’s current case, the appearance of this pattern again could mean that the recent retracement from $111,800 has run its course. With RSI now trending upward even as price presses slightly lower, Bitcoin may be witnessing another hidden accumulation phase before its next leg higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Trend Above $100,000: The Good News And The Bad News If the pattern holds true to its previous performance in April, the leading cryptocurrency could be setting up for another push toward new all-time high levels. Bitcoin is currently not far off from a new all-time high, as it is only about 5.5% away from its price peak. Based on this, another strong breakout could easily aim beyond the previous $111,800 high. Although Bitcoin’s price is relatively stagnant for now, the presence of this bullish divergence is a reminder of how quickly things can change. The previous bullish divergence ended up with a 50% price surge. A similar performance from the current price level would translate to another target above $160,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,700, up by 1.4% in the past 24 hours, already showing signs of the bullish divergence signal coming into action.

2025-06-20T22:00:17,"ChatGPT’s 42-Signal AI ETH Price Forecast Suggests Consolidation with Breakout Potential","ChatGPT’s o3 Pro AI model digested 42 live indicators and yielded a focused Ethereum price forecast as ETH hovers near $2,419.57 amid short-term consolidation and longer-term bullish cues. With the RSI near 43 and MACD showing bearish momentum, Ethereum trades between immediate support around $2,485 and resistance near $2,557 . Volume remains moderate at roughly $20.15 billion daily. Source: Cryptonews After oscillating in a $2,480 – $2,547 range today, longer-term EMAs indicate underlying strength as the price sits above the 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs yet below the 20-day EMA. The following analysis was conducted using one of ChatGPT’s AI models, the new o3 pro. The predictions were then reanalyzed and edited together for enhanced readability while maintaining analytical precision. Technical Pulse: Neutral Consolidation Amid Longer-Term Strength Ethereum’s daily chart on Binance reveals a market in a holding pattern. As of June 20, 2025 , ETH trades around $2,432.47 , having opened near $2,523 and swung between a high of $2,547.5 and a low of $2,368.68 . This tight band reflects short-term consolidation after prior moves, with RSI at 43.12 hovering just below neutral and MACD displaying a negative histogram around 45.35 , indicating mild bearish momentum without decisive breakdown. Volatility remains moderate, with daily price swings staying within roughly $180 – $201 , consistent with ATR levels implied by today’s high-low range. Source: Cryptonews Moving averages convey a mixed but overall bullish medium-term structure. The 20-day EMA sits slightly above the price at $2,557 , suggesting short-term resistance and consolidation pressure. In contrast, the 50-day EMA at $2,438 , the 100-day EMA near $2,372 , and the 200-day EMA around $2,476 lie below the current price, indicating that on medium and longer timeframes, the trend retains a bullish orientation. Source: TradingView Price holding above those EMAs argues that dips near $2,438–$2,485 could attract buyers defending the uptrend, while reclaiming the 20-day EMA would signal a resumption of upward momentum toward higher resistance zones. Volume remains moderate at approximately 204,000 ETH traded daily, reflecting steady institutional and retail participation but not yet a surge. Trading within the $2,485–$2,547 range shows a balanced tug-of-war, with sellers cap rallies near the 20-day EMA, while buyers step in near the 50-day EMA or intraday lows. This kind of balance often sets up a breakout once a catalyst appears. For now, the short-term mood is neutral to slightly bearish, yet the broader medium-term uptrend means any drop below immediate support will likely be brief and shallow. Any successful reclaiming of the 20-day EMA could quickly attract momentum traders. Support & Resistance: Defining the Key Zones Immediate support emerges at today’s low around $2,485 . Should that level fail on heavier volume, the next anchor lies near the 50-day EMA ( ~$2,438 ), a zone where buyers may re-enter if the broader uptrend remains intact. Source: TradingView Beneath that, psychological and structural support around $2,400 coincides with a stop-loss region that many traders reference, but a sustained break below the 50-day EMA would shift focus toward deeper corrective territory closer to major support zones around $1,800–$1,900 , though such a move would likely require major negative catalysts given Ethereum’s longer-term strength. On the upside, immediate resistance resides at the 20-day EMA near $2,557 , a hurdle that price has struggled to clear. Beyond this, today’s high at $2,547 marks the short-term ceiling; clearing that area convincingly on strong volume could open a path toward the next major resistance zone between $2,700 and $2,800 , where prior swing highs reside. Above that, strong resistance lies in the $3,200–$3,400 range, levels reached in previous bullish runs but requiring robust catalysts and sustained bullish conviction to revisit. Within the current consolidation, the interplay between support near $2,438–$2,485 and resistance near $2,557 shapes trading dynamics. Traders watching daily closes above $2,557 look for confirmation of renewed upside, while breaches below $2,485 , especially with volume pickup, indicate potential deeper tests of the 50-day EMA. Given moderate volatility, breakout or breakdown beyond these pivot points could occur quickly once momentum shifts, with daily ranges of roughly $60–$70 broadening if ATR expands. Liquidity & Market Depth: Assessing Fuel for Moves Ethereum’s market cap is around $293.41 billion , and daily trading volume exceeds $21.91 billion , which shows deep liquidity across major venues. Binance order-book depth typically absorbs sizable orders with manageable slippage, a necessary condition for sizable moves when volume surges. Institutional participation appears average, with stablecoin flows and on-chain activity reflecting continued usage. Order-book clusters often form around support zones near $2,480–$2,500 , offering a buffer against light sell-offs, while resting asks near $2,550–$2,580 can absorb minor rallies until a catalyst drives stronger buying. Monitoring volume-weighted moving averages in tandem with order-book snapshots can reveal subtle accumulation. If volume-weighted metrics trend upward while price lingers below the 20-day EMA, selective accumulation may be underway despite short-term consolidation. Given deep liquidity, a meaningful breakout above $2,557 would likely require noticeable volume expansion, indicating a shift in conviction. Conversely, a breach of $2,485 supported by higher sell volume could lead to a swift move toward the 50-day EMA at $2,438 . On-Chain Insights: Usage Trends and Network Health Ethereum’s on-chain metrics continue to illustrate robust ecosystem engagement. Source: Etherscan Active address counts and transaction volumes across layer-1 and layer-2 networks reflect ongoing usage. Nearly 1% of circulating ETH is held as a reserve asset on layer-2 networks, while whales are accumulating at rates unseen since 2017 . These behaviors suggest a demand baseline beyond mere speculation, as participants lock up ETH for staking, layer-2 activity, DeFi participation, and reserve strategies. Statements from Ethereum co-founders emphasize Ethereum’s vision as a “master ledger for the world,” underpinned by layer-2 expansion and ecosystem growth. Ethereum Layer 1 will be the master ledger for the . Permissionless to inspect, use and add data or functionality to. Credibly neutral. Censorship resistant. Tamper resistant and tamper evident (via slashing and transparency). Incessantly progressively decentralizing… https://t.co/jMaHHpK2na — Joseph Lubin (@ethereumJoseph) June 19, 2025 Rising stablecoin supply on Ethereum and surges in layer-2 usage indicate that transaction demand may persist or increase, supporting fee-related demand for ETH. At the same time, staking yields and burning mechanisms under EIP-1559 continue to reduce net supply , providing a deflationary tilt that underlies longer-term bullish narratives. However, token unlock schedules or large whale movements warrant attention, as large accumulation by whales can bolster price floors if buying outpaces selling. Yet, any large-scale sell-offs could stress support zones. Overall, on-chain metrics point to a healthy network with sustained usage and structural supply factors that favor longer-term strength, even as short-term price consolidates. Social Sentiment: Gauging Community and Market Mood LunarCrush data for Ethereum reveals a broadly constructive but cautious sentiment environment. A Galaxy Score around 41 suggests a mildly bullish bias, while an AltRank near 380 indicates high engagement relative to other assets. Engagement metrics totaled billions of interactions, and mentions remain elevated in the tens of thousands, with creators numbering nearly 37,570 voices shaping narratives. Sentiment sits around 83% positive or neutral-positive, indicating prevailing optimism tempered by awareness of broader market uncertainty. Social dominance near 13.35% indicates Ethereum’s outsized share of crypto chatter, meaning major news or shifts can drive swift sentiment swings. THE $ETH SETUP IS IDENTICAL TO $BTC IN 2020 Same structure. Same retrace. Same disbelief. Bitcoin went 11x. If Ethereum does the same… you know the number. pic.twitter.com/isvpngSw4K — Merlijn The Trader (@MerlijnTrader) June 19, 2025 Recent commentary points out themes such as Ethereum’s evolving role as layer-1 backbone, strong technical setups compared to historical BTC patterns, and potential breakout scenarios following consolidation in the $2,170–$2,480 zone. In sum, social sentiment reflects confidence in Ethereum’s fundamentals and network potential, but traders remain watchful for confirmation cues. Macro & Ecosystem Catalysts: Potential Triggers Ethereum’s price trajectory will hinge on a mix of ecosystem developments and broader market forces over the coming months. Major catalysts include progress on layer-2 rollouts, prominent DeFi or additional stablecoins launches driving transaction spikes, and announcements around protocol upgrades that enhance scalability or interoperability. Stablecoin supply on $ETH is skyrocketing! pic.twitter.com/uh3TOLv5zn — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) June 19, 2025 Broader crypto sentiment, influenced by macro liquidity conditions, regulatory clarity around digital assets, and institutional adoption (e.g., ETFs, corporate treasury allocations), also heavily affects Ethereum’s outlook. Given its central role in decentralized finance, geopolitical events influencing risk appetite may also prompt rotations away from or back into Ethereum. Ecosystem dynamics, such as shifts in gas fee economics or competition from other layer-1s, factor into longer-term narratives but are less likely to drive abrupt short-term moves unless tied to concrete network performance data or notable project launches. Three-Month ETH Price Forecast Scenarios Over the next 90 days, Ethereum’s price will likely follow one of three broad paths, shaped by the interplay between technical conditions, on-chain trends, social mood, and macro catalysts. Range-Bound Consolidation (Base Case) In the absence of a decisive catalyst, ETH may trade within approximately $2,400–$2,600. Short-term momentum remains neutral-to-slightly bearish below the 20-day EMA, but medium-term trend stays bullish as price holds above the 50-, 100-, and 200-day EMAs. On-chain usage continues steadily, and social sentiment retains modest optimism without euphoria. Source: TradingView Volume and volatility remain moderate, yielding choppy swings that savvy traders can exploit between support near $2,365–$2,461 and resistance near $2,557–$2,600. Longer-term holders may await clearer directional signals before adding exposure. Bullish Breakout Toward $3,000+ (Bull Case) A convergence of positive factors, such as a sustained surge in layer-2 activity, a major upgrade announcement, or a broad crypto rally fueled by macro liquidity or ETF news, could lift ETH above the 20-day EMA near $2,557. Confirmation requires robust volume expansion pushing price through $2,600 and toward the $2,700–$2,800 zone, where prior resistance resides. On-chain metrics would need to register spikes in transaction volume or staking inflows, while social sentiment (Galaxy Score rising above 60 , engagement uptick) reinforces confidence. Source: TradingView Upon clearing $2,800 , the path to $3,000 and beyond becomes feasible, potentially revisiting multi-month highs if market conditions remain constructive. Traders should manage risk with trailing stops and watch for profit-taking near key resistance zones to guard against sharp pullbacks. Deeper Correction Toward $2,200–$2,300 (Bear Case) Should negative catalysts emerge, such as disappointing ecosystem news, regulatory headwinds, or broader risk-off driving crypto-wide declines, ETH could breach near-term support around $2,485 and test the 50-day EMA near $2,438. Confirmation of deeper weakness would involve volume-backed breakdown below $2,438 , accompanied by RSI falling below 45 and MACD deepening negative. Source: TradingView On-chain signs might show slowed transaction growth or unwind of staking positions, while social sentiment shifts toward caution or fear. In this scenario, the price may retest zones at around $2,300–$2,200 , reflecting deeper consolidation territories. A breach below those could invite further selling pressure toward $2,000 or lower. However, given Ethereum’s structural strength, such moves would likely be met with increased buying interest at perceived value levels. Risk management via stop-loss placement and hedging strategies becomes paramount. ETH Price Forecast: Balancing Technicals, On-Chain Health, and Sentiment Ethereum’s current consolidation reflects a market balancing short-term caution against medium-term bullish undercurrents. Price wedged between roughly $2,485 support and $2,557 resistance underlines a waiting game: will on-chain usage or macro-driven optimism tip momentum upward, or will external headwinds trigger a test of deeper support? Participants should treat each swing as a diagnostic: does price hold near $2,485 on steady or rising transaction volumes? Does reclaiming the 20-day EMA coincide with an uptick in layer-2 activity or a surge in staking inflows? Conversely, does a breach of $2,438 align with waning on-chain metrics or broader crypto weakness? Breakout or Consolidation? Ethereum’s current range between roughly $2,485 support and $2,557 resistance reflects a market where short-term momentum leans neutral to slightly bearish under the 20-day EMA. Yet, the medium-term structure remains bullish as the price is above 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs. Over the next 90 days, the interplay of on-chain usage trends, social sentiment shifts, ecosystem milestones, and macro dynamics will determine whether ETH breaks higher toward $3,000+ or undergoes a deeper correction toward $2,200–$2,300. Traders should watch for daily closes above $2,557 to validate bullish continuation or breakdowns below $2,485–$2,438 to signal caution. At the same time, watching layer-2 activity, staking trends, user engagement, and wider market indicators can either back up or challenge recent price action.

2025-06-20T21:55:12,"Former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky waive rights to bankruptcy distributions from the defunct firm","Former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky and three related entities waived rights to bankruptcy distributions from the defunct crypto lender. The waiver cemented Mashinsky’s position as the party responsible for the collapse of Celsius. It also distanced him from making amends to the victims who lost funds. The agreement filed on Monday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York prohibited Mashinsky, AM Ventures Holdings Inc., Koala1 LLC, and Koala3 LLC from receiving any bankruptcy proceeds. The court document stipulated that all of Mashinsky’s claims submitted or scheduled on his behalf be “withdrawn, disallowed, and shall receive no distribution” under the bankruptcy plan. Mashinsky and the entities related to him were permanently barred from receiving any recovery in the Celsius bankruptcy, allowing those reserved assets to be redistributed to other creditors. However, even as Mashinsky claimed to have agreed to forfeit the assets that the government traced directly to the proceeds of his crimes, his wife asserted that she had a superior claim to the property. Her assertions would reduce what the government seized and returned to Mashinsky’s victims if credited. Attorney Clayton says America’s investors deserve better U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Jay Clayton, said the Celsius founder targeted retail investors with false promises, used their funds to place risky bets, and profited tens of millions of dollars (~$48M). At the same time, his customers lost billions (~$4.7B). Crypto influencer Tiffany Fong lost 3.1 BTC and 11.6 ETH to Celsius (over $300K at today’s prices). However, Clayton believes that America’s investors deserve better. The waiver agreement, therefore, stipulated that since the court had disallowed claims from Mashinsky and related parties, all the money and assets (crypto and company shares) that were being held for them could be released for distribution to other creditors who were owed under the bankruptcy payout plan. Mashinsky was ordered by the bankruptcy court to pay a $50K fine and forfeit $48.3 million. However, despite this specific ruling, the order clarified that it did not affect other claims, counterclaims, or defenses that the Plaintiffs, Mashinsky, AMV, Koala1, and Koala3 might have in other legal proceedings, whether in the main case or other lawsuits. Celsius has made progress in returning value to affected users, distributing over $2.5 billion to more than 251K creditors as of August 2024. However, despite the progress, reports indicated that over $1 billion in claims from ~121K creditors were filed this year alone, highlighting the scale of the liabilities Celsius faced and the number of individuals and entities impacted. Clayton also pointed out that validating and categorizing claims remained a monumental task. Mashinsky admits to giving Celsius customers ‘false comfort’ In court, Mashinsky admitted to giving Celsius customers “false comfort” by giving an interview in 2021 in which he said Celsius had received approval from regulators for its “Earn” program, which it had not. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan also said the former CEO misled Celsius’ customers to persuade them to invest, and artificially inflated the value of his company’s proprietary crypto token. He also failed to disclose that he had been selling his CEL holdings. However, Mashinsky owned up to his wrongdoings and vowed to do whatever it took to atone for his mistakes. Attorney Clayton claimed that Mashinsky marketed Celsius as the safest place for crypto, and encouraged customers to “unbank” themselves by transferring crypto assets to the platform. He repeatedly misrepresented key aspects of Celsius’s business and finances throughout his tenure to attract customers and retain their assets. His false claims covered the safety of Celsius’s yield-generating activities, its profitability, the sustainability of high reward rates, and the risks associated with depositing crypto assets on the platform. Mashinsky and others orchestrated a years-long scheme to mislead customers about the CEL token. They manipulated CEL’s price by spending hundreds of millions purchasing it on the open market to artificially inflate its value. They sometimes used customer deposits to fund these market purchases, without disclosing that to customers. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

According to SoSoValue, this is the most consistent interest Ethereum ETFs have seen since they started trading. The same products that were being called zombie funds earlier this year are suddenly alive and pulling in real money. This renewed appetite comes as the second-largest crypto by market cap finds itself back in the middle of regulatory actions in the US. Traders are also paying attention again, thanks to new progress around stablecoins, which mostly run on the Ethereum network. Source: SoSo Value A key event was the IPO of Circle, the company behind the second-largest stablecoin. That, combined with a leadership shake-up at the Ethereum Foundation, is drawing institutions back in. Institutions quietly re-enter as arbitrage opportunities grow Ben Kurland, CEO of research firm DYOR, said big players have been changing strategy. “What we’re seeing is institutional recalibration,” Ben said. “After the initial ETH ETF approval fizzled without a price pop, smart money started quietly building positions. They’re betting not on price momentum but on positioning ahead of utility unlocks like staking access, options listings, and eventually inflows from retirement platforms.” So far, Ethereum ETF inflows have reached around $3.9 billion. That’s tiny compared to bitcoin ETFs, which pulled in $36 billion in their first year. But Ethereum is starting to catch up. Chris Rhine, who heads liquid active strategies at Galaxy Digital, pointed to one reason why. “With increasing acceptance of crypto on Wall Street, especially now as a means for payments and remittances, investors are being drawn to ETH ETFs,” Chris said. The arbitrage window is also helping. Right now, the CME basis on Ethereum—the gap between futures and spot prices—is wider than Bitcoin’s. This gives traders a chance to go long on Ethereum ETFs and short on futures, squeezing out profits. That strategy is simple and repeatable. It’s also one of the forces behind the steady ETF inflows we’re seeing now. Even though the money is flowing into ETFs, the price of Ethereum itself hasn’t moved. It’s down this month. Over the past month, it’s basically flat. For the year, it’s fallen 25%. That’s not a small drop. Ethereum has struggled with its identity. Since its last major upgrade, revenue is down. Solana is gaining ground. Traders aren’t sure what Ethereum’s long-term value looks like anymore. There’s also macro pressure. This year has been full of geopolitical noise, and that has kept volatility high across crypto. In March, Standard Chartered cut its Ethereum price target by more than half. Even then, the bank said there’s still a chance the coin recovers by the end of the year. The recent ETF inflow spike already slowed down, but it hasn’t reversed. Bitcoin momentum adds fuel to Ethereum demand While Ethereum plays catch-up, Bitcoin is doing what it always does; moving the market. After hitting an all-time high in May, Bitcoin fell 10% over the next nine days. Now it’s almost fully recovered. The rebound is powered by institutions, policy, and market structure. The IBIT ETF has already hit $70 billion in assets in just 341 days. That’s more than five times faster than SPDR Gold ETF’s record. There’s also a clear setup on the charts. The weekly chart of bitcoin futures has been climbing since late 2022. One key metric, the Average Percent True Range (APTR), shows how much the price moves over time, in percentage terms. Right now, the 10-week APTR is at 8.5%. That’s low, and it usually happens just before a breakout. Every time APTR dropped to around 9% or 7%, Bitcoin launched higher. On the daily chart, APTR is hovering between 3% and 4% over the past 10 trading sessions. That’s another low reading. Bitcoin is testing the $110,000 resistance level for the third time. Some traders are calling for a breakout, with a Fibonacci target set at $135,000.

It was announced that the event, previously planned for June 25, has been moved to mid-July. According to sources familiar with the matter, Pumpfun’s token issuance and auction plan was first floated late last year. However, the event has been postponed several times since then. The project’s token auction is expected to reach a valuation of around $4 billion. The Pumpfun team is also continuing to sell token allocations to various crypto funds. However, this latest delay is not a surprise. The company has postponed its launch plans multiple times since 2024. While there has been no clear statement from Pump.fun regarding the delay, it is noteworthy that the delay coincides with serious legal issues. Related News: Two Companies Announce Bitcoin Purchase Strategy - Here's How Much They Plan to Buy Pump.fun is currently facing heavy legal pressure.

2025-06-20T20:00:31,"Bitcoin Price: Glassnode Unveils Critical Support Zone Near $97K","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price: Glassnode Unveils Critical Support Zone Near $97K Are you watching the Bitcoin price ? If so, you know how crucial identifying key levels is for navigating the volatile crypto market . On-chain analysis firm Glassnode , a trusted source for deep market insights, recently highlighted a particularly significant area that could dictate Bitcoin’s next major move. Understanding this zone is vital for anyone tracking BTC. Glassnode’s Insight: Pinpointing Key Bitcoin Support According to recent findings shared by Glassnode on X (formerly Twitter), a substantial cluster of Bitcoin supply currently sits concentrated between the $95,500 and $97,000 price levels. This isn’t just a random number; this cluster represents a significant volume of BTC that last moved within this range, often indicating areas where many holders acquired their coins. Think of it like a historical battleground on the price chart. When the price revisits such an area, these holders’ conviction is tested. Will they sell (adding supply) or hold/buy more (adding demand)? This concentration of supply often acts as a natural support level, a floor where buying pressure might emerge. Why is this specific range so important right now? Glassnode points out that this large supply cluster is located just below a critical on-chain metric: the short-term holder cost basis. Understanding the Short-Term Holder Cost Basis The short-term holder (STH) cost basis is an average price at which Bitcoin moved on-chain relatively recently. Glassnode typically defines short-term holders as entities holding BTC for less than approximately 155 days. Their cost basis represents the aggregate price they paid for their coins. Currently, the short-term holder cost basis is identified around the $98,000 mark. This level is significant because when the Bitcoin price is above the STH cost basis, this group of holders is, on average, in profit. This can sometimes lead to selling pressure as they realize gains. Conversely, when the price drops below their cost basis, they are, on average, at a loss, which can sometimes lead to panic selling or, alternatively, strong conviction holding depending on market sentiment. The fact that the large supply cluster ($95.5K-$97K) sits just below the STH cost basis ($98K) creates a layered support structure. It suggests that not only is there a historical concentration of supply in that lower zone, but the current average purchase price of recent buyers is also just above it, creating a potentially robust area of interest for market participants. Bullish vs. Bearish Scenarios: What These Levels Tell Us The on-chain analysis from Glassnode provides clear potential scenarios based on how the Bitcoin price interacts with these identified levels: Sustained Hold Above $97,000: If Bitcoin manages to consistently trade and close above the upper bound of the supply cluster ($97,000) and especially above the STH cost basis ($98,000), it would signal strong buying pressure and conviction among holders. This scenario supports the continuation of the current bullish momentum, potentially paving the way for further price appreciation. Holding above $98,000 would mean the average short-term holder is back in profit, reducing the immediate pressure to sell at a loss and potentially encouraging renewed buying. This is a key indicator for the health of the current uptrend in the crypto market . Drop Below $95,500: Conversely, a decisive drop below the lower bound of the significant supply cluster ($95,500) would be a bearish signal. Breaking below this level suggests that the historical support from the concentrated supply is failing. It could indicate that holders who acquired coins in this range are now selling, potentially triggering a cascade effect. Furthermore, if the price drops significantly below the STH cost basis ($98,000), a large portion of short-term holders would be underwater, increasing the risk of capitulation or forced selling, which could accelerate a downward price movement. Here’s a quick look at the key levels identified by Glassnode: Level/Zone Significance Potential Implication $98,000 Short-Term Holder Cost Basis Above = STH in profit (bullish); Below = STH in loss (bearish pressure) $95,500 – $97,000 Large Supply Cluster Historical area of significant acquisition, acts as potential support Why On-Chain Analysis Matters for Bitcoin Price While technical analysis focuses on price patterns and trading volume on exchanges, on-chain analysis delves into the underlying blockchain data. It tracks the movement of coins, identifies accumulation or distribution trends, and provides insights into the behavior of different groups of market participants (like short-term vs. long-term holders). Glassnode is a leader in this field, providing metrics derived directly from the Bitcoin blockchain. Their analysis of supply clusters and holder cost bases offers a unique perspective on potential support and resistance levels, complementing traditional technical analysis and providing a more fundamental view of market structure. Challenges and Considerations It’s important to remember that even strong on-chain support levels are not guaranteed floors. Market sentiment, macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, and large institutional moves can all impact the Bitcoin price and potentially override on-chain signals. Volatility is inherent in the crypto market . Furthermore, while Glassnode provides invaluable data, interpreting on-chain metrics requires expertise. The definitions of holder groups and the significance of various metrics can evolve, and these insights should be used as part of a broader analysis framework, not in isolation. Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors Based on this on-chain analysis : Monitor the $95.5K – $97K Zone: Pay close attention to price action if Bitcoin approaches this range. Look for signs of buying pressure or a bounce, which could confirm it as support. Watch the $98K Level: A move and sustained hold above $98,000 would be a strong indication of renewed bullish momentum, as it puts the average short-term holder back into profit. Identify Potential Risk: A clear break and close below $95,500 should be viewed as a significant bearish signal, potentially indicating further downside is likely. Combine Analysis: Use these on-chain insights alongside technical analysis (chart patterns, moving averages) and fundamental analysis (news, adoption trends) for a more comprehensive view of the crypto market . Conclusion: Navigating Bitcoin’s Critical Juncture Glassnode’s latest update provides a compelling look at key structural support levels for the Bitcoin price . The confluence of a large supply cluster between $95,500 and $97,000, positioned just below the short-term holder cost basis at $98,000, creates a fascinating and critical zone for the market. Holding above these levels, particularly the $98,000 mark, would reinforce the bullish narrative and suggest underlying strength from recent buyers. Conversely, a failure to hold and a break below $95,500 could signal weakness and potentially trigger a bearish phase.

Santiment says the ratio of bullish king crypto sentiment to bearish sentiment from retail traders has reached a two-month low. A low ratio of the metric is “typically a bullish sign,” according to the analytics firm. “With crypto in a bit of a lull, traders are showing signs of impatience and bearish sentiment. There are just 1.03 bullish comments for every 1 bearish comment, which hasn’t happened since peak fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) during initial tariff reactions on April 6th… …Markets historically move in the opposite direction of retail’s expectations. A prime example was the optimal buy time during the early April fear from other traders.” Source: Santiment/X Santiment further says that the Middle East conflict involving Israel and Iran will “likely continue to cause volatile and unpredictable price action” for the crypto market. “Despite the initial panic, Bitcoin has remained in the $104,000 – $105,000 range, aided by consistent exchange-traded funds (ETF) inflows and a lack of follow-through in military actions, mirroring the typical ‘risk-off, then stabilize’ pattern seen in previous geopolitical crises.” Source: Santiment/X Bitcoin is trading at $104,431 at time of writing.

In a new interview with CNBC Television, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino says that if the firm were a nation of its own, it would be the 18th-largest holder of US Treasuries in the world. “Well, Tether in 2024 was the fifth-largest purchaser of US treasuries. And if we were a country, right, I mean, we compare ourselves to countries now, and as an overall statistic, Tether is the 18th-largest holder of US treasuries.

They are considered low-risk investments due to being backed by the government. Ardoino goes on to note that the US dollar is still the safest currency in the world, adding that USDT will bring over 400 million people access to it. “By far, the US dollar is the safest fiat currency in the world… Between Bitcoin and stablecoins, they will make America stronger, and I think that is the main point of the [current] Administration.

2025-06-20T19:55:07,"CEO of Coinbase Brian Armstrong says that the world needs crypto now more than ever","The world is at crossroads, with debt growing exponentially, inflation crippling nations, and economic freedom declining. Amidst this uncertainty, the CEO of Coinbase, Brian Armstrong, is sounding an alarm that crypto can be a game-changer. Since Trump became President, markets have been unstable because of fears over the US Fed debt, inflation, and the added tariff menace. POTUS and the Fed’s chairman have been back and forth about the economy. Other than the US, other nations like Russia have reported slower economies and are also trying to fight inflation. It's no coincidence Bitcoin prices are at all-time highs. People are turning to Bitcoin as a refuge from inflation and deficit spending. It will ultimately be a check and balance on this activity. If this continues, Bitcoin could become the next world reserve currency. pic.twitter.com/Gr0hJDrWaN — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) June 20, 2025 Amidst all this, the crypto industry has thrived in most parts. In fact, the biggest coin, Bitcoin , has managed to maintain the 100k price for more than 40 days. Armstrong said, “ it’s no coincidence Bitcoin prices are at all-time highs. People are turning to Bitcoin as a refuge from inflation and deficit spending. The world needs crypto, now more than ever. “ BTC will soon grow to be the reserve currency – Armstrong According to Armstrong, the crypto industry is functioning in a way that, while Bitcoin is a store of value, stablecoins are the medium of exchange. He believes that holistic crypto adoption will take 10 to 15 years. Stablecoin legislation is navigating its way through the government. And Circle’s (CRCL) IPO was met with resounding enthusiasm. Armstrong said, “The stablecoin market cap is up 50%+ year-over-year, uncorrelated with crypto trading volume. […] This is crypto’s next daily use case, and it’s just the beginning. ” On the other hand, the Trump administration has moved to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve, though its framework remains to be determined. US companies such as GameStop (GME) and Strategy (MSTR) have been big buyers of Bitcoin to diversify their cash holdings. Trump Media & Technology (DJT) recently announced a plan to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin. Armstrong also said that he wants the US to remain in the reserve currency status. However, if the debt situation doesn’t get fixed eventually, Bitcoin will have to become the reserve currency for better or worse. He said that the Chinese RMB has no chance of becoming the reserve currency because they have their own debt problems. According to Statista, China’s total national debt is estimated at around $14.83 trillion in 2023. Coinbase strategies dedicated to Crypto Coinbase’s CEO said that they are focused on driving crypto adoption and growing the total addressable market. Their first strategy was directed towards Bitcoin, listing more assets, and now seeing real-world asset tokenization. Last year, RWA tokenization was up over 200x, with $20 billion now on-chain. He said that Coinbase is partnering with companies like Shopify to bring crypto payments to millions of merchants, further expanding the use of crypto in everyday transactions. Coinbase has created a Credit Card, powered by American Express, with up to 4% cashback paid in BTC. He added, “We’re not just putting a new UI on old rails. We’re building a new financial system from the ground up: new rails, new money, and new services like Bitcoin-backed loans using DeFi and stablecoin payments.” In addition, he said that the company is building a platform for the next generation of internet applications. According to him, the future of internet applications will be built on-chain. This allows value to flow directly to creators without intermediaries and platforms capturing most of the value. Meanwhile, the company’s first-quarter sales fell 24% from the prior year amid a slowdown in trading activity. Worthington rates Coinbase shares as Neutral with a $215 price target, suggesting 16% downside from current levels.

2025-06-20T19:50:36,"Bitcoin Price: Urgent Update as BTC Falls Below $104,000","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price: Urgent Update as BTC Falls Below $104,000 Hey crypto enthusiasts! The digital asset world is buzzing today, and not necessarily for the reasons many investors hoped. The Bitcoin price has experienced a notable dip, falling below the significant $104,000 mark. According to real-time market monitoring, the BTC price is currently trading around $103,909.99 on major exchanges like the Binance USDT market. Understanding the Latest Bitcoin Price Drop This recent Bitcoin drop below $104,000 is a key development that warrants close attention. While volatility is a hallmark of the crypto market, breaching specific price levels can trigger technical sell-offs or shift market sentiment. The $104,000 level may have been viewed by some traders as a support point, and its failure to hold could signal further downward potential in the short term. Several factors can contribute to sudden price movements in Bitcoin. Let’s explore some potential influences: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic uncertainty, inflation data, interest rate decisions by central banks, and geopolitical events can all impact investor risk appetite, leading to shifts away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Regulatory News: Announcements or rumors regarding stricter regulations on cryptocurrencies in major economies can create fear and uncertainty, prompting sell-offs. Large Liquidations: Significant liquidations of leveraged trading positions on exchanges can cascade, forcing more selling and accelerating a price decline. Market Sentiment Shifts: News cycles, social media trends, and overall investor confidence play a huge role. Negative sentiment can quickly spread, leading to panic selling. Technical Chart Patterns: Traders analyze charts for patterns and support/resistance levels. Breaking a key support level like $104,000 can trigger automated trading strategies designed to sell. What Factors Influence the BTC Price? Understanding the drivers behind the BTC price is crucial for anyone participating in the crypto market. It’s not just about supply and demand; it’s a complex interplay of global forces, technological developments, and human psychology. Here are some ongoing factors: Factor Influence on BTC Price Supply & Halvings Reduced new supply over time tends to be bullish long-term. Adoption Rates Increasing use by individuals, institutions, and businesses is bullish. Regulatory Landscape Clear, favorable regulations are bullish; restrictive ones are bearish. Technological Development Improvements to the network (e.g., scalability) can be bullish. Global Liquidity Availability of capital in the financial system can flow into crypto. While the current Bitcoin drop is concerning for some, it’s important to view it within the context of these broader factors and Bitcoin’s historical volatility. Navigating Crypto Market Volatility Price swings like the current Bitcoin drop are a stark reminder of the volatility inherent in the crypto market. For investors, this presents both challenges and potential opportunities. Challenges: Emotional stress and potential panic selling. Risk of significant losses, especially with leveraged positions. Difficulty in timing market entries and exits perfectly. Actionable Insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand the assets you invest in. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders. Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Long-Term Perspective: Many long-term investors focus on the fundamental technology and adoption rather than short-term price fluctuations. Stay Informed: Follow reliable cryptocurrency news sources to understand market drivers. This moment could be seen as a challenge for short-term traders, but for those with a long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s future, price dips can sometimes be viewed as potential accumulation opportunities. Staying Informed: The Importance of Cryptocurrency News In a fast-moving environment like the crypto market, staying updated through reliable cryptocurrency news is paramount. Knowing about regulatory shifts, technological updates, macroeconomic indicators, and significant on-chain movements can provide valuable context for price action, including the recent Bitcoin drop. Timely information helps investors make more informed decisions, avoid impulsive reactions based on fear or hype, and better understand the potential catalysts for future Bitcoin price movements. Conclusion: What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? The dip in Bitcoin price below $104,000 is a significant event for the market today. It highlights the inherent volatility and the influence of various global factors on digital asset valuations. While the immediate future price action remains uncertain, understanding the potential reasons behind this Bitcoin drop and adopting sound investment strategies are key for navigating these turbulent times.

2025-06-20T19:31:57,"CZ Highlights AI Deepfake Dangers as Hackers Target Trusted Link","Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has sounded a fresh alarm on the growing threat of AI-powered deepfakes, after a chilling real-life hack compromised Japanese crypto advocate Mai Fujimoto during a routine video call. The incident has renewed calls for stricter security habits as criminals wield advanced AI to breach even trusted communication channels. A Case Study in Modern Hacking On June 20, Fujimoto, better known online as Miss Bitcoin, narrated how she fell victim to a deepfake after being tricked into a Zoom call with an acquaintance whose Telegram account had already been compromised. According to her, the person on the video link was familiar, causing her to let down her guard. “For about 10 minutes in the online meeting, I saw her face but had no clue it was a deepfake,” Fujimoto recounted. However, there were audio issues with the call, prompting the deepfake impersonator to send a link supposedly meant to fix the problem. After clicking the link, Fujimoto unknowingly installed malware that compromised her Telegram and MetaMask. Her main X account was also hijacked, forcing her to plead with followers to report it as impersonation. She also warned users of the social platform not to click any links sent from the account. “If I had known about this kind of attack, I might not have clicked the link,” the crypto enthusiast lamented, urging widespread awareness. Her ordeal struck a chord across the crypto community, with influencers and security experts flooding X with stern reminders that in the age of AI, trust must be verified through multiple channels. CZ weighed in, too, warning his 10 million followers of the rampant use of artificial intelligence in new kinds of deepfake hackings. “Even a video call verification will soon be out of the window,” he cautioned, suggesting AI-generated impersonations will become harder to detect as the technology improves. The former Binance head urged users never to install software from unofficial links, even if they appear to come from friends. The Rise of AI-Powered Fraud The attack on Fujimoto is hardly isolated. A major report released by Bitget only days ago revealed that deepfake technology had played a role in nearly 40% of all high-value crypto frauds in 2024, contributing to at least $4.6 billion lost to scams. The study documented criminals using AI to create convincing fake videos of public figures like Elon Musk promoting scams, simulating customer service chats, and crucially, weaponizing video conferencing tools like Zoom with malicious links. Additionally, a different publication by Chainalysis noted that lawbreakers were increasingly using AI tools, including deepfakes, to bypass KYC measures and automate fraud, making crypto cons “increasingly difficult to detect.” In one such instance, Hong Kong police arrested 31 individuals linked to a syndicate that stole $34 million using AI-generated videos of crypto executives. Terrifyingly, the report warned that AI-driven swindles are poised to grow significantly.

2025-06-20T19:30:22,"Solana Analyst Sees $123 And $116 As Mid-Zone Support Levels – Here’s Why","Solana is currently testing a critical demand zone near the $150 level after enduring weeks of persistent selling pressure and a broader shift in market sentiment. The asset is now trading roughly 20% below its May high of $185, with recent attempts at recovery facing strong resistance. Despite holding above major support for now, the overall structure suggests that downside risk remains if market conditions don’t improve soon. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Eyes High Timeframe Close – Range Break Above $2,800 Could Be Violent Top analyst Efloud shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting the importance of tracking Solana’s response to broader Bitcoin dynamics. He noted that if Bitcoin (BTC) continues to consolidate sideways while Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) rises, altcoins like SOL may struggle. In that case, Solana could continue retracing to find stronger support at mid-zones, particularly around the $123 and $116 levels. These price zones have previously acted as solid support/resistance areas and could serve as key inflection points should bearish momentum persist. A breakdown toward these targets would likely coincide with increasing BTC.D and continued investor caution in the altcoin market. Until then, SOL remains vulnerable within a fragile technical structure, and traders will closely watch for either a rebound or deeper correction in the coming days. Solana Holds Key Support As Analysts Eye Bullish Scenarios Solana is currently trading about 50% down from its all-time highs, with the explosive momentum seen at the end of 2024 now replaced by more subdued price action. The asset’s underperformance has left investors cautious, but many analysts remain optimistic about Solana’s potential once a new altcoin rally begins. For now, the focus is on holding critical demand zones that could determine whether SOL is gearing up for a recovery or further downside. According to Efloud, if Bitcoin continues consolidating sideways while Bitcoin dominance rises, Solana may find support at several mid-zones, particularly around $123 and $116. The $140 region has historically acted as a strong support/resistance flip, and a deviation around this level—losing it briefly before regaining it with strength—could present a short-term buying opportunity. Efloud notes that this scenario doesn’t necessarily imply that SOL must drop to those levels, but current market conditions—aside from Bitcoin—lack strong pair structures. If SOL can decisively break above the $168 resistance, a new leg upward could be triggered, with $230 potentially acting as the next major resistance zone. On the SOL/BTC pair, Efloud is watching for a reclaim of the 0.0015 level or a pullback toward 0.00115 for confirmation. Another key support sits at 0.000988 sats. Despite the current cooling, the structure may still offer solid opportunities for new entrants. If these levels hold and macro conditions improve, SOL could be setting the stage for a sustainable rally, ultimately leading to new all-time highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Mirrors Bitcoin 2017-2021 Pattern – $4,000 Is The Trigger Point Weekly Chart Analysis – Holding the Line Near Key Support Solana is currently trading at $148.33 on the weekly timeframe, showing a 3% decline over the past seven days. The price has dropped roughly 20% from its May high of around $185 and is now testing the critical $140–$150 support zone. This level has repeatedly acted as a pivot point in the past and could define SOL’s short-term trajectory. The chart shows that Solana has been unable to reclaim the 50-week moving average (currently near $170), which now acts as key resistance. A decisive weekly close above this level would open the door for a bullish continuation toward $185 and possibly $200. However, failure to hold above the 100-week moving average around $132 could lead to further downside pressure, with $123 and $116 as the next demand zones to watch—levels identified by analyst Efloud in his mid-zone scenario. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates as Realized Profits Stay Low – No Signs Of Major Sell-Off Yet Volume has declined steadily over the past three weeks, signaling reduced participation, but also suggesting that aggressive selling is fading. If bulls manage to reclaim $160 with conviction, the structure remains favorable.

2025-06-20T19:20:06,"Project Eleven Raises $6M to Guard Bitcoin From Quantum Hacks","Project Eleven, a post-quantum cryptography startup, has raised $6 million from Variant Fund, Quantonation, and top crypto VCs to develop the tools and standards needed to protect Bitcoin and the broader digital asset ecosystem from future quantum computing attacks. With over $600 billion in BTC potentially exposed, the project’s roadmap is now at the center of crypto’s security conversation. Why Quantum Threats Matter for Bitcoin—And Why Now Quantum computers are rapidly advancing, and experts warn that within a decade, machines could emerge that can break Bitcoin’s elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) using Shor’s algorithm. According to Project Eleven and YCharts, more than 10 million Bitcoin addresses with non-zero balances have already exposed their public keys, putting over 6 million BTC—worth about $648 billion—at theoretical risk if quantum computers reach “Q-Day” capabilities. “As quantum computing capabilities advance, the threat to systems like Bitcoin is no longer theoretical, it’s imminent. This funding allows us to stay ahead of that curve, building the tools, standards, and ecosystem required to ensure digital assets remain secure in a post-quantum world.” — Alex Pruden, CEO, Project Eleven Yellowpages and Migration Without a Hard Fork Project Eleven’s flagship product, Yellowpages , is a cryptographic registry designed to let users proactively secure their Bitcoin against quantum threats—without waiting for a network-wide protocol upgrade. Here’s how it works: Users generate a new, quantum-resistant key pair using post-quantum cryptography (such as lattice-based algorithms). They create a cryptographic proof linking their current Bitcoin address to the new quantum-safe address, without exposing sensitive information or moving funds on-chain. This proof is timestamped and registered in Yellowpages, an off-chain, publicly verifiable registry that acts as a fallback if quantum computers ever compromise Bitcoin’s existing keys. Yellowpages has already been audited by Cure 53, and Project Eleven is in discussions with Bitcoin Core developers about integrating post-quantum migration tools into future wallet software. Unlike proposals like QRAMP, which would require a hard fork and broad consensus, Yellowpages offers a way for users and institutions to migrate at their own pace—potentially sidestepping years of governance gridlock. What Miners, Wallets, and Exchanges Must Do The migration to post-quantum security is not just a technical challenge—it’s a community-wide coordination problem. Miners and exchanges will need to: Update wallet infrastructure to support quantum-resistant key generation and proof registration. Educate users about the risks of exposed public keys and the steps needed to secure their assets. Monitor for “Q-Day” signals and be ready to accelerate migration if quantum breakthroughs occur. Wallet providers, especially those serving institutions and high-net-worth clients, are expected to be the first to integrate Yellowpages and related tools. Exchanges may also require proof of quantum-safe migration for large withdrawals or cold storage. The $1 BTC Bounty and the Race to Q-Day To benchmark the quantum threat, Project Eleven has launched the Q-Day Prize —offering 1 BTC to the first team that can break a toy version of Bitcoin’s cryptography using Shor’s algorithm on a quantum computer. This challenge, running through April 2026, aims to provide real-world data on how close the quantum threat truly is and to incentivize researchers to stress-test existing defenses. What’s Next for Quantum-Resistant Crypto With $6 million in new funding, Project Eleven plans to expand its team, accelerate Yellowpages adoption, and develop additional standards for post-quantum security across digital assets. The company is also exploring quantum-resistant applications for secure messaging and decentralized communications. The broader crypto industry is watching closely. As quantum hardware advances, the pressure to migrate will only intensify. The next 2–5 years will be critical: those who prepare now could weather the quantum storm, while those who wait may find themselves locked out of their own wallets. The Bottom Line Project Eleven’s $6 million war chest marks a turning point in Bitcoin’s defense against quantum threats. With user-friendly migration tools, open-source audits, and a pragmatic approach to community adoption, the path to a quantum-resistant Bitcoin is finally coming into focus. The question is: will the ecosystem move fast enough?",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9647/project-eleven-raises-6-m-to-guard-bitcoin-from-quantum-hacks,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|FORKS","News|Legal",cryptocompare
2025-06-20T19:15:20,"Arizona Edges Closer To Building Bitcoin Reserve From Seized Crypto As Revived Bill Passes In Senate","Arizona lawmakers revived and voted to advance House Bill 2324 (HB 2324), a proposed legislation to create a state-managed reserves fund for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies seized through criminal forfeiture. The bill, which is now cleared to head to the House for the final vote, passed the Senate on Thursday in a narrow 16-14 vote. The legislation failed a final vote in the House in May and was returned to the Senate for revisions. If passed, the bill would authorize the State Treasurer to create the Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund to manage crypto assets seized through criminal asset forfeiture. The fund would allow the state government to invest funds in crypto assets or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) holding digital assets. Under the proposed distribution structure, the first $300,000 from seized digital asset sales would go to the Anti-Racketeering Revolving Fund. If the sale surpasses that amount, the remaining balance would be split, with 50% going to the Attorney General, 25% to the state general fund, and 25% to the new Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund. The bill modifies Arizona’s forfeiture laws to include procedures for securing lawfully confiscated crypto assets. It requires authorities to either obtain credentials like private keys or seed phrases or move them to a state-approved digital wallet. HB 2324 will need to secure a majority vote from the 60 Arizona House members, 33 of whom are Republicans, for approval to send it to Governor Katie Hobbs’ desk. Arizona is one of many states that have introduced crypto-related legislation since President Donald Trump’s return to office, inspired by a broader national push to establish digital asset frameworks at the state level. New Hampshire is the only state to have successfully completed the legislative process for establishing a BTC reserve. Notably, a bill in Texas, like Arizona, is also in its final stages . Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate recently passed the landmark GENIUS stablecoin bill , which is now headed to the House for further consideration. President Trump urged the House to pass the GENIUS Act as soon as possible so he can officially sign it into law, calling it essential to securing America’s standing as the “undisputed leader” in crypto assets.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/arizona-edges-closer-to-building-bitcoin-reserve-from-seized-crypto-as-revived-bill-passes-in-senate/,"BTC|FIAT|REGULATION","Cryptocurrency|News|arizona|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

The latest $51.5 million PIPE round proves investors are all-in on the crypto pivot, even as skeptics question the long-term play. KindlyMD and Nakamoto Holdings, the Bitcoin ( BTC )-focused investment firm founded by David Bailey, announced on June 20 that they have secured an additional $51.5 million in PIPE financing, bringing their total committed capital for Bitcoin treasury accumulation to $763 million. The latest round, priced at $5 per share in KindlyMD stock, was fully subscribed in under 72 hours, signaling strong institutional interest despite broader market uncertainty. “Investor demand for Nakamoto is incredibly strong. This additional financing was raised in under 72 hours, adding the option for more working capital in addition to acquiring bitcoin. We continue to execute our strategy to raise as much capital as possible to acquire as much bitcoin as possible,” David Bailey, Founder and CEO of Nakamoto, said. You might also like: Solana, Aptos tie for top spot in Wyoming’s hunt for WYST stablecoin partner According to the statement, KindlyMD will use the funds to purchase Bitcoin and bolster working capital once its expected merger with Nakamoto closes following shareholder approval. Nakamoto’s latest capital raise is part of a broader trend: corporations are stockpiling Bitcoin at an unprecedented pace. The number of companies executing formal Bitcoin treasury strategies now exceeds 220, according to public filings and data from BitcoinTreasuries.net. That list includes Strategy, the Michael Saylor-led firm that pioneered corporate BTC accumulation during the pandemic, as well as relative newcomers like Semler Scientific and Metaplanet, which are deploying capital into BTC as both a treasury reserve and a long-term hedge against inflation and currency debasement. However, while institutional investor appetite for Bitcoin continues to rise, analysts warn that BTC-focused corporate treasuries pose various risks, including liquidity concerns, regulatory uncertainties and crypto market’s notorious volatility, which can force firms to sell at a loss in bear markets.

2025-06-20T19:00:29,"KindlyMD Secures $51.5M to Boost Bitcoin Treasury Ahead of Strategic Nakamoto Merger","BitcoinWorld KindlyMD Secures $51.5M to Boost Bitcoin Treasury Ahead of Strategic Nakamoto Merger In a significant move signaling a growing convergence between traditional markets and the digital asset space, KindlyMD (NASDAQ: NAKA), a company poised to merge with the Bitcoin-native firm Nakamoto Holdings , has announced a substantial capital raise. The company has successfully secured an additional $51.5 million through Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE) financing. This funding is earmarked primarily to bolster its Bitcoin treasury , a strategic decision that aligns closely with the vision of its future merger partner. This latest infusion of capital adds to KindlyMD’s already impressive fundraising efforts. According to reports, the company has now raised a total of $563 million specifically through PIPE deals, with the overall funds raised, including convertible notes, reaching a staggering $763 million. These funds are intended to support a two-pronged strategy: significant Bitcoin purchases to build out the treasury and financing general operational needs. The company anticipates that this financing round will officially close concurrently with the completion of the planned crypto merger with Nakamoto Holdings. What Does This $51.5M PIPE Financing Mean for KindlyMD? The announcement of a $51.5 million raise through PIPE financing is a critical development for KindlyMD . PIPE stands for Private Investment in Public Equity. It’s a way for a publicly traded company to raise capital by selling stock directly to private investors, such as hedge funds, mutual funds, or other large accredited investors. Unlike a traditional follow-on public offering, PIPE deals are often negotiated directly between the company and the investors, allowing for faster execution and potentially more favorable terms, although they can sometimes involve selling shares at a discount to the market price. For KindlyMD, this specific PIPE round is noteworthy for several reasons: Targeted Use: A significant portion is explicitly designated for building a Bitcoin treasury , demonstrating a clear strategic intent towards digital assets. Scale of Funding: The $51.5 million is part of a much larger fundraising effort, bringing the total PIPE funds to $563 million and overall funds to $763 million. This indicates strong investor confidence in the company’s future direction, including the planned merger and Bitcoin strategy. Merger Alignment: The timing of the financing closing alongside the merger underscores the integral role this capital plays in the post-merger entity’s strategy, particularly concerning its digital asset holdings. This capital infusion provides KindlyMD with the financial muscle needed not only for day-to-day operations but, more importantly, to execute its strategic pivot towards becoming a company with a significant Bitcoin presence on its balance sheet, heavily influenced by the impending merger with Nakamoto Holdings . Why Build a Bitcoin Treasury? The Strategic Logic The decision by KindlyMD to allocate substantial funds towards building a Bitcoin treasury is a strategic move that reflects a growing trend among forward-thinking companies. Holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset goes beyond simply investing; it’s a statement about a company’s view on macroeconomic trends, monetary policy, and the future of finance. Here are some key strategic rationales: Inflation Hedge: With its fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is often seen as a potential hedge against inflation and the devaluation of fiat currencies. Companies holding large cash reserves in traditional currencies face erosion of purchasing power over time. Digital Gold Narrative: Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as ‘digital gold’ – a scarce, portable, divisible, and censorship-resistant store of value in the digital age. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding Bitcoin provides diversification away from traditional assets like cash, bonds, and real estate, which may face different risk profiles. Attracting Talent and Investors: For certain companies, particularly those in tech or finance, having a Bitcoin treasury can signal innovation and attract employees and investors who are bullish on the digital asset space. This is particularly relevant for KindlyMD given the nature of its merger partner, Nakamoto Holdings . Alignment with Future Business: For companies whose business models may involve or interact with blockchain technology or cryptocurrencies, holding Bitcoin on the balance sheet provides closer alignment with their operational focus. This is clearly the case for KindlyMD’s planned crypto merger . While the potential benefits are significant, it’s crucial to acknowledge the risks, primarily the inherent price volatility of Bitcoin. However, for companies with a long-term view and a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s future, building a treasury can be a powerful strategic play. Nakamoto Holdings: The Bitcoin-Native Partner in This Crypto Merger The context of this significant PIPE financing and the drive to build a Bitcoin treasury is inseparable from KindlyMD’s planned merger with Nakamoto Holdings . While details about Nakamoto Holdings in the provided snippet are brief (‘Bitcoin-native firm’), this description is highly informative. A ‘Bitcoin-native firm’ typically means a company whose core business or philosophy is deeply rooted in the Bitcoin ecosystem. This could involve: Bitcoin mining operations Developing infrastructure or services for the Bitcoin network Providing financial services centered around Bitcoin Holding substantial Bitcoin on its balance sheet as a primary asset The merger with such a firm suggests that the post-merger entity will have a strong strategic focus on Bitcoin. This explains why KindlyMD is proactively building its Bitcoin holdings ahead of the completion of the crypto merger . The combined entity is likely positioning itself to be a significant player with a substantial digital asset base and potentially business operations tied directly to the Bitcoin network. The synergy here is clear: KindlyMD brings public market access and significant capital-raising ability (evidenced by the $763 million total raise), while Nakamoto Holdings brings expertise, infrastructure, or existing assets within the Bitcoin native space. The formation of a robust Bitcoin treasury appears to be a foundational element of this combined strategy, funded significantly by the recent PIPE financing rounds. Benefits and Challenges of a Corporate Bitcoin Treasury Embarking on the path of building a corporate Bitcoin treasury , as KindlyMD is doing ahead of its Nakamoto Holdings merger, comes with a distinct set of potential benefits and significant challenges that companies must carefully navigate. Potential Benefits: Capital Appreciation Potential: If Bitcoin’s price increases over time, the value of the company’s treasury holdings grows, potentially boosting its balance sheet strength. Macroeconomic Hedge: Provides a potential hedge against currency devaluation, inflation, and economic instability in traditional markets. Signaling Innovation: Demonstrates a forward-thinking approach and willingness to embrace new financial technologies, which can resonate with investors and customers in the tech-savvy world. Liquidity (with Caveats): Bitcoin is a globally traded asset with deep liquidity, meaning it can generally be bought or sold relatively easily (though large trades can impact price). Attracting Specific Investor Base: Can attract investors who are specifically looking for exposure to Bitcoin through equity markets, potentially increasing stock demand. Significant Challenges: Extreme Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile. Holdings can experience rapid and significant drops in value, leading to potential impairment losses on the balance sheet under current accounting rules (like GAAP). Accounting Treatment: Under current accounting standards (like U.S. GAAP), Bitcoin is typically treated as an indefinite-lived intangible asset. This means companies must record impairment losses if the market value drops below their cost basis, but they cannot record gains until the asset is sold. This can create volatile earnings reports. (Note: Potential changes to accounting rules are being discussed). Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions, which could impact the legal status, trading, or holding of Bitcoin. Security Risks: Holding significant amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures (custody solutions, private key management) to protect against theft or loss. Public Perception and Scrutiny: Holding Bitcoin can attract scrutiny from analysts, regulators, and the public, requiring clear communication of the strategy and risks. KindlyMD, especially post-merger with Nakamoto Holdings , will need to expertly manage these challenges while aiming to capitalize on the potential benefits of its expanding Bitcoin treasury , funded in part by the recent PIPE financing . Learning from Others: Examples of Companies with Bitcoin Treasuries While KindlyMD ‘s move to build a Bitcoin treasury ahead of its Nakamoto Holdings merger is significant, it’s not entirely unprecedented. Several other publicly traded companies have famously added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, providing valuable case studies. Understanding their motivations and experiences can offer insights into KindlyMD’s strategy following this major PIPE financing . Prominent examples include: MicroStrategy (MSTR): Perhaps the most well-known corporate Bitcoin holder. Led by Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy began aggressively accumulating Bitcoin in 2020, viewing it as a superior store of value compared to holding cash. They have continued to acquire Bitcoin through various means, including convertible debt offerings, making it a core part of their corporate strategy. Their holdings are now substantial, and their stock price is often seen as a proxy for Bitcoin exposure. Tesla (TSLA): In early 2021, Tesla announced a $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin and briefly accepted it as payment for vehicles. While they later sold a significant portion of their holdings, citing the need for cash liquidity, their initial move highlighted the potential for even mainstream tech giants to explore digital assets for their treasury. Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) & Riot Platforms (RIOT): As large-scale Bitcoin mining companies, these firms naturally accumulate Bitcoin through their operations and often hold a significant portion of it on their balance sheets. Their business models are directly tied to the Bitcoin network’s success. These examples demonstrate varying degrees of commitment and different rationales for holding Bitcoin. MicroStrategy represents a deep, long-term conviction play, while Tesla’s move was more opportunistic and later partially reversed. KindlyMD’s approach, influenced by its merger with a ‘Bitcoin-native’ firm like Nakamoto Holdings and funded significantly by PIPE financing , appears to lean towards a strategic, integrated approach where Bitcoin is likely central to the future identity and operations of the combined company. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Investors? The news of KindlyMD raising $51.5 million specifically to fund a Bitcoin treasury ahead of its merger with Nakamoto Holdings provides several key takeaways for investors and market watchers interested in the intersection of traditional finance and cryptocurrency. This significant PIPE financing deal is more than just a capital raise; it’s a signal. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor the Merger: The completion of the merger with Nakamoto Holdings is crucial. The structure and strategy of the combined entity will heavily influence how the Bitcoin treasury is managed and integrated into the business. Keep an eye on regulatory approvals and closing timelines. Assess the Post-Merger Strategy: Understand how the combined KindlyMD/Nakamoto entity plans to utilize its Bitcoin treasury. Will it be purely a passive holding, or will it be leveraged in some way related to the ‘Bitcoin-native’ business operations? This will impact the company’s risk profile and growth potential. Evaluate Bitcoin Exposure: For investors interested in gaining exposure to Bitcoin through equity, the merged entity could become an option, similar to how MicroStrategy is viewed. However, assess the company’s primary business alongside its Bitcoin holdings to understand the full investment picture. Understand the Risks: Be fully aware of the volatility risk associated with a large Bitcoin treasury. Changes in Bitcoin’s price will likely impact the company’s balance sheet and potentially its stock price. Also, consider the accounting implications (impairment losses). Watch for Further Institutional Adoption: This move by KindlyMD and Nakamoto Holdings could be indicative of a broader trend. Observe if other companies, particularly those merging or undergoing strategic shifts, also begin to explore adding Bitcoin or other digital assets to their treasuries, potentially spurred by successful PIPE financing rounds like this one. This development underscores the increasing importance of digital assets in corporate finance and strategy. Investors need to adapt their analysis to include these new factors when evaluating companies like KindlyMD post-merger. Summary: A Bold Step Towards a Bitcoin-Centric Future The announcement that KindlyMD has successfully raised an additional $51.5 million through PIPE financing , specifically earmarked for building a robust Bitcoin treasury , marks a pivotal moment for the company as it prepares for its strategic crypto merger with Nakamoto Holdings . This latest raise contributes to a significant total of $563 million from PIPE deals and $763 million overall, demonstrating strong investor confidence in the company’s future direction. The decision to heavily invest in Bitcoin as a treasury asset aligns perfectly with the ‘Bitcoin-native’ identity of Nakamoto Holdings, signaling a clear strategic intent for the combined entity. While building a corporate Bitcoin treasury presents potential benefits such as acting as an inflation hedge and offering diversification, it also comes with significant challenges, primarily the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market and complex accounting treatments. By funding this initiative through substantial PIPE financing and timing its closure with the merger, KindlyMD and Nakamoto Holdings are positioning themselves as a potentially significant player at the intersection of traditional finance and the burgeoning Bitcoin ecosystem. This move provides valuable insights for investors watching the space, highlighting the increasing institutional interest in digital assets and the strategic considerations involved in integrating them into corporate balance sheets and business models.

2025-06-20T18:59:25,"Norway Plans 2025 Ban on Power-Hungry Crypto Mining Centers – Industry on Edge","Norway is preparing to impose a temporary ban on the establishment of new cryptocurrency mining data centers that use the most power-intensive technologies. The move is part of a broader effort to conserve electricity for other sectors of the economy, according to a statement released by the government on Friday. The proposal is expected to take effect in autumn 2025 and would make Norway the first country in Europe to introduce targeted restrictions on crypto mining through data center regulation. Norway to Ban New Power-Hungry Crypto Mining Centers According to Reuters, Digitalization Minister Karianne Tung said the government is determined to clamp down on what it sees as unsustainable use of energy. “The Labour Party government has a clear intention to limit the mining of cryptocurrency in Norway as much as possible,” she said. JUST IN: Norway to BAN Bitcoin mining facilities. Digitalization Minister Karianne Tung says Bitcoin mining uses significant electricity with minimal local economic benefits. — Jacob King (@JacobKinge) June 20, 2025 Energy Minister Terje Aasland echoed that position, noting the environmental challenges posed by the industry. The government considers crypto mining incompatible with its climate goals, especially due to its high electricity consumption and limited value in terms of jobs or long-term investment. The decision builds on earlier measures. In 2022, the government proposed ending reduced electricity tax rates for data centers, which would have forced mining operations to pay standard energy costs. Finance Minister Trygve Slagsvold Vedum backed the measure, emphasizing the need to prioritize electricity for broader societal benefit. “Cryptocurrency mining is very power-intensive and generates little in the way of jobs and income for the local community,” Tung added. Norway’s abundance of cheap, renewable electricity, mainly from hydropower, has made it an attractive destination for crypto mining firms. In 2021, hydropower accounted for 92% of the country’s electricity, with wind power contributing another 7%. According to data from Cambridge University’s Bitcoin Mining Map in early 2022, Norwegian miners made up about 0.74% of Bitcoin’s global hash rate. Other estimates have put the figure closer to 2%. The government is also moving ahead with legislation introduced in April that seeks to regulate data centers more broadly. Operators would be required to register with local authorities and disclose ownership and the nature of services provided. This push for regulation reflects growing concern in Norway about how electricity is used, particularly as other industries face rising costs and pressure to meet sustainability goals. While the crypto sector has benefited from the country’s low-cost energy, officials now question its long-term benefits. As the global conversation around crypto mining and energy usage continues, Norway’s latest move marks a shift toward stricter control over how digital infrastructure is allowed to grow. Norwegian Town Faces Higher Power Bills After Bitcoin Mining Ban—A Pricey Victory? As Norway intensifies efforts to curb energy consumption with a nationwide ban on new crypto mining data centers, the local fallout is already being felt. In September 2024, a Bitcoin mining center in Hadsel municipality shut down following years of noise complaints and political pressure. While the closure ended a long-running dispute, it came with an unexpected consequence: a 20% spike in residents’ electricity bills . The mining plant consumed about 80 GWh annually, equivalent to the energy use of 3,200 households, according to the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK). Its constant fan noise had caused serious disturbance, with a 2022 report describing locals as “distraught.” Despite this, the operating company maintained it had stayed within national noise limits. Hadsel Mayor Kjell-Børge Freiberg celebrated the shutdown, calling the plant “a nuisance for the past three years.” But the loss of the facility, which contributed 20% of local grid operator Noranett’s income, has left residents footing the difference. Noranett’s network manager, Robin Jakobsen, said households could now pay NOK 2,500–3,000 more annually (around $235–$280). As the municipality seeks new industrial partners to absorb the surplus energy, the incident illustrates the complex trade-offs in regulating crypto mining . While the goal is to reduce environmental strain, the economic ripple effects are unavoidable. Norway’s regulatory stance echoes broader international trends. Russia, for instance, has also imposed a mining ban across ten regions, set to begin in 2025, citing energy conservation. As governments tighten crypto mining policies, the tension between environmental responsibility and economic impact becomes increasingly apparent.
