2025-06-20T23:30:14,"Holding 2,000 XRP Today Could Make You a Millionaire in 2040. Check the Simple Math","As interest in long-term cryptocurrency investments continues to grow, one question among XRP holders has attracted significant attention: Can a modest portfolio of 2,000 XRP tokens reach a valuation of $1 million by the year 2040? While the idea may seem ambitious given current market conditions, a range of experts and analysts have weighed in on its feasibility. Evaluating the Entry Cost and Portfolio Range At XRP’s current price of approximately $2.16, acquiring 2,000 tokens would cost around $4,320. Wallets holding this amount fall into the mid-tier bracket on the XRP Rich List , which groups accounts with holdings between 1,000 and 5,000 tokens. Data shows that approximately 8.25% of on-chain wallets fall within this category. To reach a portfolio value of $1 million, the price of XRP would need to increase substantially. Specifically, the token would have to reach $500, representing a 23,048% increase from its present value. Whether such growth is achievable over the next 15 years remains the primary point of debate. Realistic Assessment of Market Capitalization Achieving a $500 valuation would place XRP’s market capitalization at nearly $29.5 trillion, assuming its circulating supply remains at about 59 billion tokens. For context, this figure would far surpass the current total global cryptocurrency market cap of roughly $3.27 trillion and even exceed the estimated value of the global gold market, which is approximately $23.18 trillion. These comparisons underscore the magnitude of the challenge ahead. Analyst Predictions for XRP by 2040 Despite these challenges, multiple forecasting platforms have offered optimistic projections. Forecasts from AI platforms like Grok and Gemini suggest a highly optimistic outlook for XRP by 2040. Grok predicted that XRP could trade between $1,160 and $1,450 by then. If accurate, this would push the value of a 2,000 XRP portfolio well beyond $1 million. Gemini provided a wider price range, estimating XRP could rise between $76 and $1,868, depending on positive regulatory shifts, adoption by financial institutions, and overall market conditions. At the upper end of this forecast, 2,000 XRP could be valued at over $3.7 million. Crypto trading platform Changelly has also released long-term estimates. It anticipates that XRP will be priced between $647 and $810 by 2040. At these levels, a 2,000-token portfolio could be worth between $1.29 million and $1.62 million. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, not all analysts are as bullish. Telegaon offers a more conservative outlook, suggesting XRP could reach a high of $160 by 2040, with a minimum estimate of $119. Even at its projected peak, this would place a 2,000-token portfolio at $320,000, far short of the millionaire benchmark. Community Sentiment and Influencer Insights The community continues to speculate on the long-term potential of the asset. Influencers like Austin Hilton have emphasized the importance of increasing token holdings over time and maintaining long-term patience. Edward Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy, has noted that early adopters may one day share stories of success rooted in high-risk bets. Coach JV, a well-known market analyst, believes that Bitcoin reaching $1 million could create favourable conditions for significant XRP gains as well. While the possibility of turning a 2,000 XRP investment into $1 million exists in theory, it depends on a combination of optimistic scenarios, including massive price appreciation, market expansion, and regulatory clarity. Most predictions acknowledge the growth potential, but few see the $500 per token mark as a realistic outcome in the current climate. Investors should remain cautious, informed, and grounded when evaluating such long-term projections. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-06-20T23:00:15,"Traders Are Rotating Into MAGACOINFINANCE Over Legacy Coins Like XRP and BTC","Intro: From Legacy Leaders to Strategic Starters Traders are making moves this month — and not in the direction you might expect. Instead of doubling down on market giants like Bitcoin and XRP, many are shifting toward emerging plays with higher upside potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a clear beneficiary of this shift, as early investors seek asymmetric returns before mainstream exposure kicks in. Bitcoin (BTC) Loses Momentum to Emerging Tokens Bitcoin remains the dominant force in the crypto market, but its price action has cooled. Following several weeks of volatility, BTC is consolidating while traders reassess risk appetite. As momentum fades, many short-term investors are pulling capital from Bitcoin in search of assets with sharper growth trajectories and more aggressive token incentives. XRP Holds Institutional Hopes Amid Uncertainty XRP continues to garner institutional interest, especially with the Ripple vs. SEC case nearing closure. The recent motion to release $125 million from escrow has improved sentiment, and speculation around an XRP ETF remains alive. Still, traders are cautious — split between long-term optimism and short-term uncertainty. This has opened the door for new capital rotation into earlier-phase projects like MAGACOINFINANCE. MAGACOINFINANCE: Where Trader Sentiment Is Converging While Bitcoin and XRP consolidate, MAGACOINFINANCE is quietly gaining market share in trading circles — and it’s doing so by offering something most new projects lack: real structure. With a 170 billion token cap, a fully audited smart contract (verified by HashEx), and live staking incentives, the fundamentals are solid. But what’s especially driving rotation is the behavior on-chain — early buyers aren’t exiting. They’re staking, holding, and accumulating. This isn’t just about tokenomics — it’s about timing. The promo PATRIOTS100X adds a compelling bonus to early purchases, reinforcing the idea that even modest entries could deliver outsize results in 2025. As larger-cap assets stall, MAGACOINFINANCE’s tailored setup is making it a standout pick among risk-aware yet reward-seeking investors. Other Coins Holding Position Without Breakout Power Polygon (MATIC) remains a respected name in scaling and enterprise adoption but hasn’t seen a breakout this cycle. VeChain (VET) continues building in the supply chain space, though it hasn’t gained traction in trading volumes recently. Injective (INJ) is maintaining relevance in decentralized finance circles but lacks momentum. Polkadot (DOT) is making ecosystem progress, yet the token’s performance hasn’t aligned with its roadmap, pushing traders to reconsider their positions. Final Thoughts As capital rotates out of high-profile but slow-moving assets like Bitcoin and XRP, the hunt for stronger ROI leads directly to MAGACOINFINANCE . Its combination of staking, locked supply, credible auditing, and community ownership offers traders something rare — structure and excitement in one place.

2025-06-20T23:00:00,"Whales Watch From Afar as Lightchain AI Attracts the Kind of Grassroots Movement That Top 10 Coins Can’t","While whales watch cautiously from afar, Lightchain AI is quietly igniting a grassroots movement that top 10 cryptocurrencies struggle to replicate. With $20.9 million raised in its presale and tokens priced steadily at $0.007, Lightchain AI is attracting a diverse base of retail investors and builders who believe in its intelligent, scalable infrastructure. Unlike established giants weighed down by large holders and slow adoption, Lightchain AI’s momentum is powered by active community engagement and consistent buyer interest. This organic growth signals a shift in market dynamics—where real innovation and grassroots support may outperform sheer market cap and hype in the evolving crypto landscape. Top 10 Coins Hold Value but Struggle With Community Engagement Despite holding contrary positions from the market, most popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Binance Coin (BNB) experience difficulty in maintaining active community participation. Even as these assets draw in institutional money and volume, their communities often don’t have the buzz of the latest hot new project. Take Bitcoin and Ethereum, for example—what became of the grassroots efforts surrounding those two? Even though both fulfilled their role of providing the footings from which to build, it was a long time before we saw any real discussion outside of price talk. By contrast, newer tokens, such as Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX), have built-up active communities by offering developer grants and interactive arena, promoting more user participation. This contradiction emphasizes the need of community participation to maintain motivation and innovation in the cryptocurrency space in the long term. Lightchain AI Builds Momentum Through Organic, Grassroots Support Lightchain AI is building momentum not through aggressive marketing, but through genuine, grassroots support across crypto circles. As Stage 15 closes and the Bonus Round begins, its fixed pricing and transparent vision are resonating with early adopters who value real utility. Much of this support stems from its decentralized infrastructure—highlighting tokenomics designed for long-term health and builder incentives over insider gains. The full reallocation of the 5% Team Allocation toward developer grants has further fueled its community-first perception. Traders, developers, and researchers are engaging with the protocol for what it delivers: a purpose-built AI blockchain with scalable workflows, privacy-preserving data handling, and gas-optimized execution. Lightchain AI’s rise is quiet—but it’s rooted in credibility. Lightchain AI- Powering the Future, One Block at Time Lightchain AI is sparking a revolution, built on scalable AI infrastructure and decentralized collaboration. With advanced gas optimization slashing costs for AI tasks, it’s never been easier—or more efficient—to innovate. In a bold move, the original 5% team allocation was completely removed and redirected into growth initiatives like developer grants, ecosystem incentives, and core protocol development. This builder-first approach is turning heads, drawing in retail traders and dedicated ecosystem contributors alike. The future of AI is here, and it’s powered by Lightchain AI . https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/whales-watch-from-afar-as-lightchain-ai-attracts-the-kind-of-grassroots-movement-that-top-10-coins-cant/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|SOL","Press Release",cryptocompare
2025-06-20T22:59:27,"On-chain Wealth Turns Deadly: Crypto Kidnapping in Paris Forces Victim to Hand Over Ledger Wallet","A 23-year-old man was reportedly kidnapped in Maisons-Alfort, a suburb of Paris, in what marks the latest in a growing number of violent incidents linked to cryptocurrency. According to a Thursday report by Le Parisien, the victim was abducted earlier this week and held for several hours as his captors demanded access to both cash and his Ledger wallet. The attackers reportedly targeted the victim and his partner, forcing them into a situation that French police are now investigating as kidnapping and unlawful confinement by an organized gang. Paris Suburb Sees Another Crypto-Linked Kidnapping as Attacks Escalate The incident began on Tuesday morning when the young couple left their home by car. They had set out on errands. When the driver couldn’t find parking, his partner got out while he circled the neighborhood. A 23 year old man was kidnapped Tuesday while out shopping in Maisons-Alfort, France. The attackers called his partner and demanded his Ledger and 5,000 EUR in cash. She complied & he was released. This is the 10th wrench attack this year in France! https://t.co/ZE7WK8vtcQ — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) June 20, 2025 Minutes later, she received a message from her partner claiming he had an urgent work issue. Unaware of the real situation, she returned home. That’s when the event quickly escalated. Her phone rang. It was a video call. On the screen wasn’t her partner, but another man. The person on the call demanded that she gather €5,000 in cash and a Ledger hardware wallet and place them in a bag. “Violence was used to make him talk,” a source told Le Parisien, indicating the kidnappers had knowledge of the man’s crypto holdings. The woman, following the instructions, waited outside her home with the bag. A third person arrived and collected it. By 5 p.m., the victim called his partner. He had been released in the nearby town of Créteil and was on his way back. French authorities have not disclosed any details about the man’s identity or the exact amount of crypto involved. Police from Val-de-Marne are now handling the case. A source confirmed that the woman has been handed over to the judicial police. “This is a sensitive case,” a police official said. The Anti-Banditism Brigade has reportedly made several arrests in connection with a series of recent kidnappings targeting crypto holders. Tuesday’s attack is the tenth such case to surface in France in recent months, raising alarm among local crypto users and law enforcement. Investigators believe the victim was carefully selected and that the perpetrators had detailed information about his assets and routines. Surge in Violent Crypto Kidnappings Sparks Security Concerns Across Europe and Beyond The recent wrench attack in a Paris suburb is just the latest in a chilling trend of violent crimes targeting crypto holders in 2025. According to data compiled by Bitcoin security advocate Jameson Lopp, at least 32 wrench attacks have occurred globally this year, nearly one-third in France alone, putting 2025 on track to surpass the previous record of 36 incidents in 2021. The assaults are becoming more brutal and calculated. Early this month, a crypto influencer in Essonne was kidnapped and beaten after attackers demanded €50,000 in crypto. They released him after discovering his wallet was nearly empty. In January, David Balland, co-founder of Ledger, and his wife were kidnapped in rural France . Balland also had a finger cut off as part of a ransom attempt. Twelve suspects were later arrested . David Balland, co-founder of French cryptocurrency hardware wallet manufacturer @Ledger was kidnapped alongside his wife in a shocking incident that left him with severe injuries to one of his hands. #Ledger #CryptoCrime https://t.co/IvCjWeovS6 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 24, 2025 In one of the most harrowing cases this year, the father of a young poker player-turned-crypto trader was abducted by men posing as delivery workers . The kidnappers demanded up to €7 million and sent a video of the victim’s finger being severed. He was later rescued by police in a dramatic operation. French police freed the kidnapped father of a #crypto entrepreneur in a nighttime raid on Sunday after he was held hostage – and mutilated – for two days. https://t.co/9THKJ3UMMw — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 5, 2025 Other attacks have similarly targeted families of crypto executives. In May, Pierre Noizat, CEO of Paymium, narrowly avoided tragedy when a group attempted to kidnap his daughter and grandson . That same month, authorities charged 25 suspects linked to a broader kidnapping ring across Paris. The violence hasn’t been confined to France. In the U.S., victims in New York and Las Vegas were kidnapped at gunpoint , one of them was driven over 70 miles into the Arizona desert by assailants seeking access to his wallet. Security experts say the increase in ransom demands, mutilation, and family targeting reflects a new phase in crypto-related crime. Private firms like Amsterdam-based Infinite Risks International report a surge in demand from crypto executives seeking 24/7 protection .

2025-06-20T22:30:20,"Bitcoin Bullish Divergence That Appeared Before The May ATH Has Returned Again","Bitcoin is currently hovering in a tightly compressed price range after failing multiple times to break above $110,000 earlier this month. The past few days have been characterized by the leading cryptocurrency trading around $105,000, with neither bulls nor bears taking control. Despite the overall consolidation, a subtle yet significant signal is starting to flash beneath the surface, particularly on the 4-hour chart, that might send Bitcoin to a new all-time high soon. Return Of Rare Divergence Pattern On Bitcoin’s 4H Chart Crypto analyst Luca (@CrypticTrades_) took to social media platform X to share a chart that highlights an important technical development on Bitcoin’s 4-hour timeframe: the return of a bullish divergence. This signal, which previously appeared in early April, preceded the massive rally that catapulted Bitcoin to its May 22 all-time high of $111,800. The same divergence is forming once again and another Bitcoin price breakout may be very close. Related Reading: Why The Bitcoin Price Could See Another 70%-170% Jump From Here As shown in the 4-hour candlestick timeframe chart below, the divergence is clearly illustrated between price action and the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Price has been forming lower lows, while the RSI has been printing higher lows. This mismatch serves as an early indicator that selling momentum is fading, and a reversal to the upside could follow. The previous instance of this pattern directly preceded a sharp move from a $74,000 low in early April to above $111,000 in just a few weeks. What Does This Divergence Mean For Bitcoin’s Price? Bullish divergences on mid-timeframe charts like the 4-hour have a reputation for being the first reversal signals when supported by rising volume. In Bitcoin’s current case, the appearance of this pattern again could mean that the recent retracement from $111,800 has run its course. With RSI now trending upward even as price presses slightly lower, Bitcoin may be witnessing another hidden accumulation phase before its next leg higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Trend Above $100,000: The Good News And The Bad News If the pattern holds true to its previous performance in April, the leading cryptocurrency could be setting up for another push toward new all-time high levels. Bitcoin is currently not far off from a new all-time high, as it is only about 5.5% away from its price peak. Based on this, another strong breakout could easily aim beyond the previous $111,800 high. Although Bitcoin’s price is relatively stagnant for now, the presence of this bullish divergence is a reminder of how quickly things can change. The previous bullish divergence ended up with a 50% price surge. A similar performance from the current price level would translate to another target above $160,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,700, up by 1.4% in the past 24 hours, already showing signs of the bullish divergence signal coming into action.

2025-06-20T22:00:17,"ChatGPT’s 42-Signal AI ETH Price Forecast Suggests Consolidation with Breakout Potential","ChatGPT’s o3 Pro AI model digested 42 live indicators and yielded a focused Ethereum price forecast as ETH hovers near $2,419.57 amid short-term consolidation and longer-term bullish cues. With the RSI near 43 and MACD showing bearish momentum, Ethereum trades between immediate support around $2,485 and resistance near $2,557 . Volume remains moderate at roughly $20.15 billion daily. Source: Cryptonews After oscillating in a $2,480 – $2,547 range today, longer-term EMAs indicate underlying strength as the price sits above the 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs yet below the 20-day EMA. The following analysis was conducted using one of ChatGPT’s AI models, the new o3 pro. The predictions were then reanalyzed and edited together for enhanced readability while maintaining analytical precision. Technical Pulse: Neutral Consolidation Amid Longer-Term Strength Ethereum’s daily chart on Binance reveals a market in a holding pattern. As of June 20, 2025 , ETH trades around $2,432.47 , having opened near $2,523 and swung between a high of $2,547.5 and a low of $2,368.68 . This tight band reflects short-term consolidation after prior moves, with RSI at 43.12 hovering just below neutral and MACD displaying a negative histogram around 45.35 , indicating mild bearish momentum without decisive breakdown. Volatility remains moderate, with daily price swings staying within roughly $180 – $201 , consistent with ATR levels implied by today’s high-low range. Source: Cryptonews Moving averages convey a mixed but overall bullish medium-term structure. The 20-day EMA sits slightly above the price at $2,557 , suggesting short-term resistance and consolidation pressure. In contrast, the 50-day EMA at $2,438 , the 100-day EMA near $2,372 , and the 200-day EMA around $2,476 lie below the current price, indicating that on medium and longer timeframes, the trend retains a bullish orientation. Source: TradingView Price holding above those EMAs argues that dips near $2,438–$2,485 could attract buyers defending the uptrend, while reclaiming the 20-day EMA would signal a resumption of upward momentum toward higher resistance zones. Volume remains moderate at approximately 204,000 ETH traded daily, reflecting steady institutional and retail participation but not yet a surge. Trading within the $2,485–$2,547 range shows a balanced tug-of-war, with sellers cap rallies near the 20-day EMA, while buyers step in near the 50-day EMA or intraday lows. This kind of balance often sets up a breakout once a catalyst appears. For now, the short-term mood is neutral to slightly bearish, yet the broader medium-term uptrend means any drop below immediate support will likely be brief and shallow. Any successful reclaiming of the 20-day EMA could quickly attract momentum traders. Support & Resistance: Defining the Key Zones Immediate support emerges at today’s low around $2,485 . Should that level fail on heavier volume, the next anchor lies near the 50-day EMA ( ~$2,438 ), a zone where buyers may re-enter if the broader uptrend remains intact. Source: TradingView Beneath that, psychological and structural support around $2,400 coincides with a stop-loss region that many traders reference, but a sustained break below the 50-day EMA would shift focus toward deeper corrective territory closer to major support zones around $1,800–$1,900 , though such a move would likely require major negative catalysts given Ethereum’s longer-term strength. On the upside, immediate resistance resides at the 20-day EMA near $2,557 , a hurdle that price has struggled to clear. Beyond this, today’s high at $2,547 marks the short-term ceiling; clearing that area convincingly on strong volume could open a path toward the next major resistance zone between $2,700 and $2,800 , where prior swing highs reside. Above that, strong resistance lies in the $3,200–$3,400 range, levels reached in previous bullish runs but requiring robust catalysts and sustained bullish conviction to revisit. Within the current consolidation, the interplay between support near $2,438–$2,485 and resistance near $2,557 shapes trading dynamics. Traders watching daily closes above $2,557 look for confirmation of renewed upside, while breaches below $2,485 , especially with volume pickup, indicate potential deeper tests of the 50-day EMA. Given moderate volatility, breakout or breakdown beyond these pivot points could occur quickly once momentum shifts, with daily ranges of roughly $60–$70 broadening if ATR expands. Liquidity & Market Depth: Assessing Fuel for Moves Ethereum’s market cap is around $293.41 billion , and daily trading volume exceeds $21.91 billion , which shows deep liquidity across major venues. Binance order-book depth typically absorbs sizable orders with manageable slippage, a necessary condition for sizable moves when volume surges. Institutional participation appears average, with stablecoin flows and on-chain activity reflecting continued usage. Order-book clusters often form around support zones near $2,480–$2,500 , offering a buffer against light sell-offs, while resting asks near $2,550–$2,580 can absorb minor rallies until a catalyst drives stronger buying. Monitoring volume-weighted moving averages in tandem with order-book snapshots can reveal subtle accumulation. If volume-weighted metrics trend upward while price lingers below the 20-day EMA, selective accumulation may be underway despite short-term consolidation. Given deep liquidity, a meaningful breakout above $2,557 would likely require noticeable volume expansion, indicating a shift in conviction. Conversely, a breach of $2,485 supported by higher sell volume could lead to a swift move toward the 50-day EMA at $2,438 . On-Chain Insights: Usage Trends and Network Health Ethereum’s on-chain metrics continue to illustrate robust ecosystem engagement. Source: Etherscan Active address counts and transaction volumes across layer-1 and layer-2 networks reflect ongoing usage. Nearly 1% of circulating ETH is held as a reserve asset on layer-2 networks, while whales are accumulating at rates unseen since 2017 . These behaviors suggest a demand baseline beyond mere speculation, as participants lock up ETH for staking, layer-2 activity, DeFi participation, and reserve strategies. Statements from Ethereum co-founders emphasize Ethereum’s vision as a “master ledger for the world,” underpinned by layer-2 expansion and ecosystem growth. Ethereum Layer 1 will be the master ledger for the . Permissionless to inspect, use and add data or functionality to. Credibly neutral. Censorship resistant. Tamper resistant and tamper evident (via slashing and transparency). Incessantly progressively decentralizing… https://t.co/jMaHHpK2na — Joseph Lubin (@ethereumJoseph) June 19, 2025 Rising stablecoin supply on Ethereum and surges in layer-2 usage indicate that transaction demand may persist or increase, supporting fee-related demand for ETH. At the same time, staking yields and burning mechanisms under EIP-1559 continue to reduce net supply , providing a deflationary tilt that underlies longer-term bullish narratives. However, token unlock schedules or large whale movements warrant attention, as large accumulation by whales can bolster price floors if buying outpaces selling. Yet, any large-scale sell-offs could stress support zones. Overall, on-chain metrics point to a healthy network with sustained usage and structural supply factors that favor longer-term strength, even as short-term price consolidates. Social Sentiment: Gauging Community and Market Mood LunarCrush data for Ethereum reveals a broadly constructive but cautious sentiment environment. A Galaxy Score around 41 suggests a mildly bullish bias, while an AltRank near 380 indicates high engagement relative to other assets. Engagement metrics totaled billions of interactions, and mentions remain elevated in the tens of thousands, with creators numbering nearly 37,570 voices shaping narratives. Sentiment sits around 83% positive or neutral-positive, indicating prevailing optimism tempered by awareness of broader market uncertainty. Social dominance near 13.35% indicates Ethereum’s outsized share of crypto chatter, meaning major news or shifts can drive swift sentiment swings. THE $ETH SETUP IS IDENTICAL TO $BTC IN 2020 Same structure. Same retrace. Same disbelief. Bitcoin went 11x. If Ethereum does the same… you know the number. pic.twitter.com/isvpngSw4K — Merlijn The Trader (@MerlijnTrader) June 19, 2025 Recent commentary points out themes such as Ethereum’s evolving role as layer-1 backbone, strong technical setups compared to historical BTC patterns, and potential breakout scenarios following consolidation in the $2,170–$2,480 zone. In sum, social sentiment reflects confidence in Ethereum’s fundamentals and network potential, but traders remain watchful for confirmation cues. Macro & Ecosystem Catalysts: Potential Triggers Ethereum’s price trajectory will hinge on a mix of ecosystem developments and broader market forces over the coming months. Major catalysts include progress on layer-2 rollouts, prominent DeFi or additional stablecoins launches driving transaction spikes, and announcements around protocol upgrades that enhance scalability or interoperability. Stablecoin supply on $ETH is skyrocketing! pic.twitter.com/uh3TOLv5zn — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) June 19, 2025 Broader crypto sentiment, influenced by macro liquidity conditions, regulatory clarity around digital assets, and institutional adoption (e.g., ETFs, corporate treasury allocations), also heavily affects Ethereum’s outlook. Given its central role in decentralized finance, geopolitical events influencing risk appetite may also prompt rotations away from or back into Ethereum. Ecosystem dynamics, such as shifts in gas fee economics or competition from other layer-1s, factor into longer-term narratives but are less likely to drive abrupt short-term moves unless tied to concrete network performance data or notable project launches. Three-Month ETH Price Forecast Scenarios Over the next 90 days, Ethereum’s price will likely follow one of three broad paths, shaped by the interplay between technical conditions, on-chain trends, social mood, and macro catalysts. Range-Bound Consolidation (Base Case) In the absence of a decisive catalyst, ETH may trade within approximately $2,400–$2,600. Short-term momentum remains neutral-to-slightly bearish below the 20-day EMA, but medium-term trend stays bullish as price holds above the 50-, 100-, and 200-day EMAs. On-chain usage continues steadily, and social sentiment retains modest optimism without euphoria. Source: TradingView Volume and volatility remain moderate, yielding choppy swings that savvy traders can exploit between support near $2,365–$2,461 and resistance near $2,557–$2,600. Longer-term holders may await clearer directional signals before adding exposure. Bullish Breakout Toward $3,000+ (Bull Case) A convergence of positive factors, such as a sustained surge in layer-2 activity, a major upgrade announcement, or a broad crypto rally fueled by macro liquidity or ETF news, could lift ETH above the 20-day EMA near $2,557. Confirmation requires robust volume expansion pushing price through $2,600 and toward the $2,700–$2,800 zone, where prior resistance resides. On-chain metrics would need to register spikes in transaction volume or staking inflows, while social sentiment (Galaxy Score rising above 60 , engagement uptick) reinforces confidence. Source: TradingView Upon clearing $2,800 , the path to $3,000 and beyond becomes feasible, potentially revisiting multi-month highs if market conditions remain constructive. Traders should manage risk with trailing stops and watch for profit-taking near key resistance zones to guard against sharp pullbacks. Deeper Correction Toward $2,200–$2,300 (Bear Case) Should negative catalysts emerge, such as disappointing ecosystem news, regulatory headwinds, or broader risk-off driving crypto-wide declines, ETH could breach near-term support around $2,485 and test the 50-day EMA near $2,438. Confirmation of deeper weakness would involve volume-backed breakdown below $2,438 , accompanied by RSI falling below 45 and MACD deepening negative. Source: TradingView On-chain signs might show slowed transaction growth or unwind of staking positions, while social sentiment shifts toward caution or fear. In this scenario, the price may retest zones at around $2,300–$2,200 , reflecting deeper consolidation territories. A breach below those could invite further selling pressure toward $2,000 or lower. However, given Ethereum’s structural strength, such moves would likely be met with increased buying interest at perceived value levels. Risk management via stop-loss placement and hedging strategies becomes paramount. ETH Price Forecast: Balancing Technicals, On-Chain Health, and Sentiment Ethereum’s current consolidation reflects a market balancing short-term caution against medium-term bullish undercurrents. Price wedged between roughly $2,485 support and $2,557 resistance underlines a waiting game: will on-chain usage or macro-driven optimism tip momentum upward, or will external headwinds trigger a test of deeper support? Participants should treat each swing as a diagnostic: does price hold near $2,485 on steady or rising transaction volumes? Does reclaiming the 20-day EMA coincide with an uptick in layer-2 activity or a surge in staking inflows? Conversely, does a breach of $2,438 align with waning on-chain metrics or broader crypto weakness? Breakout or Consolidation? Ethereum’s current range between roughly $2,485 support and $2,557 resistance reflects a market where short-term momentum leans neutral to slightly bearish under the 20-day EMA. Yet, the medium-term structure remains bullish as the price is above 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs. Over the next 90 days, the interplay of on-chain usage trends, social sentiment shifts, ecosystem milestones, and macro dynamics will determine whether ETH breaks higher toward $3,000+ or undergoes a deeper correction toward $2,200–$2,300. Traders should watch for daily closes above $2,557 to validate bullish continuation or breakdowns below $2,485–$2,438 to signal caution. At the same time, watching layer-2 activity, staking trends, user engagement, and wider market indicators can either back up or challenge recent price action.

2025-06-20T21:55:12,"Former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky waive rights to bankruptcy distributions from the defunct firm","Former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky and three related entities waived rights to bankruptcy distributions from the defunct crypto lender. The waiver cemented Mashinsky’s position as the party responsible for the collapse of Celsius. It also distanced him from making amends to the victims who lost funds. The agreement filed on Monday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York prohibited Mashinsky, AM Ventures Holdings Inc., Koala1 LLC, and Koala3 LLC from receiving any bankruptcy proceeds. The court document stipulated that all of Mashinsky’s claims submitted or scheduled on his behalf be “withdrawn, disallowed, and shall receive no distribution” under the bankruptcy plan. Mashinsky and the entities related to him were permanently barred from receiving any recovery in the Celsius bankruptcy, allowing those reserved assets to be redistributed to other creditors. However, even as Mashinsky claimed to have agreed to forfeit the assets that the government traced directly to the proceeds of his crimes, his wife asserted that she had a superior claim to the property. Her assertions would reduce what the government seized and returned to Mashinsky’s victims if credited. Attorney Clayton says America’s investors deserve better U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Jay Clayton, said the Celsius founder targeted retail investors with false promises, used their funds to place risky bets, and profited tens of millions of dollars (~$48M). At the same time, his customers lost billions (~$4.7B). Crypto influencer Tiffany Fong lost 3.1 BTC and 11.6 ETH to Celsius (over $300K at today’s prices). However, Clayton believes that America’s investors deserve better. The waiver agreement, therefore, stipulated that since the court had disallowed claims from Mashinsky and related parties, all the money and assets (crypto and company shares) that were being held for them could be released for distribution to other creditors who were owed under the bankruptcy payout plan. Mashinsky was ordered by the bankruptcy court to pay a $50K fine and forfeit $48.3 million. However, despite this specific ruling, the order clarified that it did not affect other claims, counterclaims, or defenses that the Plaintiffs, Mashinsky, AMV, Koala1, and Koala3 might have in other legal proceedings, whether in the main case or other lawsuits. Celsius has made progress in returning value to affected users, distributing over $2.5 billion to more than 251K creditors as of August 2024. However, despite the progress, reports indicated that over $1 billion in claims from ~121K creditors were filed this year alone, highlighting the scale of the liabilities Celsius faced and the number of individuals and entities impacted. Clayton also pointed out that validating and categorizing claims remained a monumental task. Mashinsky admits to giving Celsius customers ‘false comfort’ In court, Mashinsky admitted to giving Celsius customers “false comfort” by giving an interview in 2021 in which he said Celsius had received approval from regulators for its “Earn” program, which it had not. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan also said the former CEO misled Celsius’ customers to persuade them to invest, and artificially inflated the value of his company’s proprietary crypto token. He also failed to disclose that he had been selling his CEL holdings. However, Mashinsky owned up to his wrongdoings and vowed to do whatever it took to atone for his mistakes. Attorney Clayton claimed that Mashinsky marketed Celsius as the safest place for crypto, and encouraged customers to “unbank” themselves by transferring crypto assets to the platform. He repeatedly misrepresented key aspects of Celsius’s business and finances throughout his tenure to attract customers and retain their assets. His false claims covered the safety of Celsius’s yield-generating activities, its profitability, the sustainability of high reward rates, and the risks associated with depositing crypto assets on the platform. Mashinsky and others orchestrated a years-long scheme to mislead customers about the CEL token. They manipulated CEL’s price by spending hundreds of millions purchasing it on the open market to artificially inflate its value. They sometimes used customer deposits to fund these market purchases, without disclosing that to customers. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-06-20T21:00:52,"Analyst Says To Expect Dogecoin Price At $5 This Cycle","A bold new forecast is calling for Dogecoin to reach an astonishing $5 price level this market cycle. The claim, shared on the social media platform X, is backed by a visual chart analysis that illustrates a repeating pattern of consolidation and breakout phases in Dogecoin’s price movements since its launch. Drawing from the price action in past cycles, the analyst argues that the memecoin is once again preparing for an explosive price action that could see it surging well above the $1 price level. Repetitive Patterns Say Breakout Is Brewing For Dogecoin According to crypto analyst CryptoELITES, Dogecoin’s price chart has a repeating structure of symmetrical triangle formations, each followed by vertical price surges. The chart, which plots Dogecoin’s historical rallies from its early price history to the present day, highlights three distinct triangle breakouts that led to interesting price peaks. Each rally began with a symmetrical triangle consolidation phase that was followed by a breakout to the upside. The first of these patterns ended with a price spike to around $0.002. The second triangle formed over a longer period and eventually drove Dogecoin to roughly $0.013. At the time, the rally laid the groundwork for retail interest in the meme coin niche. The third breakout, however, was the most iconic. Following months of sideways movement within a tightening symmetrical triangle, DOGE exploded upwards and peaked at $0.7316 in May 2021. That rally was on the back of social media hype and a FOMO that transformed Dogecoin from a meme cryptocurrency into one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. This peak at $0.73 was followed by a bear phase of consolidations in another symmetrical triangle that eventually broke to the upside last year. Interestingly, the breakout has stalled and has led to a correction in recent months, but this is all part of a similar playout in previous cycle breakouts. Keeping the possibility of a continuation in mind, crypto analyst CryptoElites projected a similar run to the 2021 bull rally. Particularly, the analyst drew a bold projection arrow extending from the current price action to the $5 mark. According to the analyst, “If you’re not expecting $5, you probably don’t know anything.” $5 Price Target For DOGE Reaching $5 per Dogecoin would be nothing short of monumental for the cryptocurrency. Based on Dogecoin’s circulating supply of approximately 149 billion tokens, a $5 price target would imply a market capitalization above $720 billion. That figure would place Dogecoin just behind Bitcoin in terms of market cap, overtaking Ethereum’s current market cap by a wide margin. Such a Dogecoin valuation would require a high level of participation from both retail and institutional investors. Although this price target may appear ambitious, DOGE has defied expectations before. Its 36,000% rally in the 2020 to 2021 bull cycle serves as a reminder of the explosive force of retail momentum. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.168 after breaking below $0.17 again in the past 24 hours.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-to-5-this-cycle/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Dogecoin|CryptoELITES|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Ethereum|fomo|meme coin|Symmetrical Triangle Pattern",cryptocompare

2025-06-20T20:55:30,"Ethereum ETF inflows have surged for six straight weeks","Ethereum ETFs are finally waking up after months of being ignored. After launching in July 2024 with barely any excitement, these funds are now pulling in cash for the sixth straight week, and have booked inflows in eight of the last nine weeks. According to SoSoValue, this is the most consistent interest Ethereum ETFs have seen since they started trading. The same products that were being called zombie funds earlier this year are suddenly alive and pulling in real money. This renewed appetite comes as the second-largest crypto by market cap finds itself back in the middle of regulatory actions in the US. Traders are also paying attention again, thanks to new progress around stablecoins, which mostly run on the Ethereum network. Source: SoSo Value A key event was the IPO of Circle, the company behind the second-largest stablecoin. That, combined with a leadership shake-up at the Ethereum Foundation, is drawing institutions back in. Institutions quietly re-enter as arbitrage opportunities grow Ben Kurland, CEO of research firm DYOR, said big players have been changing strategy. “What we’re seeing is institutional recalibration,” Ben said. “After the initial ETH ETF approval fizzled without a price pop, smart money started quietly building positions. They’re betting not on price momentum but on positioning ahead of utility unlocks like staking access, options listings, and eventually inflows from retirement platforms.” So far, Ethereum ETF inflows have reached around $3.9 billion. That’s tiny compared to bitcoin ETFs, which pulled in $36 billion in their first year. But Ethereum is starting to catch up. Chris Rhine, who heads liquid active strategies at Galaxy Digital, pointed to one reason why. “With increasing acceptance of crypto on Wall Street, especially now as a means for payments and remittances, investors are being drawn to ETH ETFs,” Chris said. The arbitrage window is also helping. Right now, the CME basis on Ethereum—the gap between futures and spot prices—is wider than Bitcoin’s. This gives traders a chance to go long on Ethereum ETFs and short on futures, squeezing out profits. That strategy is simple and repeatable. It’s also one of the forces behind the steady ETF inflows we’re seeing now. Even though the money is flowing into ETFs, the price of Ethereum itself hasn’t moved. It’s down this month. Over the past month, it’s basically flat. For the year, it’s fallen 25%. That’s not a small drop. Ethereum has struggled with its identity. Since its last major upgrade, revenue is down. Solana is gaining ground. Traders aren’t sure what Ethereum’s long-term value looks like anymore. There’s also macro pressure. This year has been full of geopolitical noise, and that has kept volatility high across crypto. In March, Standard Chartered cut its Ethereum price target by more than half. Even then, the bank said there’s still a chance the coin recovers by the end of the year. The recent ETF inflow spike already slowed down, but it hasn’t reversed. Bitcoin momentum adds fuel to Ethereum demand While Ethereum plays catch-up, Bitcoin is doing what it always does; moving the market. After hitting an all-time high in May, Bitcoin fell 10% over the next nine days. Now it’s almost fully recovered. The rebound is powered by institutions, policy, and market structure. The IBIT ETF has already hit $70 billion in assets in just 341 days. That’s more than five times faster than SPDR Gold ETF’s record. There’s also a clear setup on the charts. The weekly chart of bitcoin futures has been climbing since late 2022. One key metric, the Average Percent True Range (APTR), shows how much the price moves over time, in percentage terms. Right now, the 10-week APTR is at 8.5%. That’s low, and it usually happens just before a breakout. Every time APTR dropped to around 9% or 7%, Bitcoin launched higher. On the daily chart, APTR is hovering between 3% and 4% over the past 10 trading sessions. That’s another low reading. Bitcoin is testing the $110,000 resistance level for the third time. Some traders are calling for a breakout, with a Fibonacci target set at $135,000.

It was announced that the event, previously planned for June 25, has been moved to mid-July. According to sources familiar with the matter, Pumpfun’s token issuance and auction plan was first floated late last year. However, the event has been postponed several times since then. The project’s token auction is expected to reach a valuation of around $4 billion. The Pumpfun team is also continuing to sell token allocations to various crypto funds. However, this latest delay is not a surprise. The company has postponed its launch plans multiple times since 2024. While there has been no clear statement from Pump.fun regarding the delay, it is noteworthy that the delay coincides with serious legal issues.

2025-06-20T20:00:31,"Bitcoin Price: Glassnode Unveils Critical Support Zone Near $97K","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price: Glassnode Unveils Critical Support Zone Near $97K Are you watching the Bitcoin price ? If so, you know how crucial identifying key levels is for navigating the volatile crypto market . On-chain analysis firm Glassnode , a trusted source for deep market insights, recently highlighted a particularly significant area that could dictate Bitcoin’s next major move. Understanding this zone is vital for anyone tracking BTC. Glassnode’s Insight: Pinpointing Key Bitcoin Support According to recent findings shared by Glassnode on X (formerly Twitter), a substantial cluster of Bitcoin supply currently sits concentrated between the $95,500 and $97,000 price levels. This isn’t just a random number; this cluster represents a significant volume of BTC that last moved within this range, often indicating areas where many holders acquired their coins. Think of it like a historical battleground on the price chart. When the price revisits such an area, these holders’ conviction is tested. Will they sell (adding supply) or hold/buy more (adding demand)? This concentration of supply often acts as a natural support level, a floor where buying pressure might emerge. Why is this specific range so important right now? Glassnode points out that this large supply cluster is located just below a critical on-chain metric: the short-term holder cost basis. Understanding the Short-Term Holder Cost Basis The short-term holder (STH) cost basis is an average price at which Bitcoin moved on-chain relatively recently. Glassnode typically defines short-term holders as entities holding BTC for less than approximately 155 days. Their cost basis represents the aggregate price they paid for their coins. Currently, the short-term holder cost basis is identified around the $98,000 mark. This level is significant because when the Bitcoin price is above the STH cost basis, this group of holders is, on average, in profit. This can sometimes lead to selling pressure as they realize gains. Conversely, when the price drops below their cost basis, they are, on average, at a loss, which can sometimes lead to panic selling or, alternatively, strong conviction holding depending on market sentiment. The fact that the large supply cluster ($95.5K-$97K) sits just below the STH cost basis ($98K) creates a layered support structure. It suggests that not only is there a historical concentration of supply in that lower zone, but the current average purchase price of recent buyers is also just above it, creating a potentially robust area of interest for market participants. Bullish vs. Bearish Scenarios: What These Levels Tell Us The on-chain analysis from Glassnode provides clear potential scenarios based on how the Bitcoin price interacts with these identified levels: Sustained Hold Above $97,000: If Bitcoin manages to consistently trade and close above the upper bound of the supply cluster ($97,000) and especially above the STH cost basis ($98,000), it would signal strong buying pressure and conviction among holders. This scenario supports the continuation of the current bullish momentum, potentially paving the way for further price appreciation. Holding above $98,000 would mean the average short-term holder is back in profit, reducing the immediate pressure to sell at a loss and potentially encouraging renewed buying. This is a key indicator for the health of the current uptrend in the crypto market . Drop Below $95,500: Conversely, a decisive drop below the lower bound of the significant supply cluster ($95,500) would be a bearish signal. Breaking below this level suggests that the historical support from the concentrated supply is failing. It could indicate that holders who acquired coins in this range are now selling, potentially triggering a cascade effect. Furthermore, if the price drops significantly below the STH cost basis ($98,000), a large portion of short-term holders would be underwater, increasing the risk of capitulation or forced selling, which could accelerate a downward price movement. Here’s a quick look at the key levels identified by Glassnode: Level/Zone Significance Potential Implication $98,000 Short-Term Holder Cost Basis Above = STH in profit (bullish); Below = STH in loss (bearish pressure) $95,500 – $97,000 Large Supply Cluster Historical area of significant acquisition, acts as potential support Why On-Chain Analysis Matters for Bitcoin Price While technical analysis focuses on price patterns and trading volume on exchanges, on-chain analysis delves into the underlying blockchain data. It tracks the movement of coins, identifies accumulation or distribution trends, and provides insights into the behavior of different groups of market participants (like short-term vs. long-term holders). Glassnode is a leader in this field, providing metrics derived directly from the Bitcoin blockchain. Their analysis of supply clusters and holder cost bases offers a unique perspective on potential support and resistance levels, complementing traditional technical analysis and providing a more fundamental view of market structure. Challenges and Considerations It’s important to remember that even strong on-chain support levels are not guaranteed floors. Market sentiment, macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, and large institutional moves can all impact the Bitcoin price and potentially override on-chain signals. Volatility is inherent in the crypto market . Furthermore, while Glassnode provides invaluable data, interpreting on-chain metrics requires expertise. The definitions of holder groups and the significance of various metrics can evolve, and these insights should be used as part of a broader analysis framework, not in isolation. Actionable Insights for Traders and Investors Based on this on-chain analysis : Monitor the $95.5K – $97K Zone: Pay close attention to price action if Bitcoin approaches this range. Look for signs of buying pressure or a bounce, which could confirm it as support. Watch the $98K Level: A move and sustained hold above $98,000 would be a strong indication of renewed bullish momentum, as it puts the average short-term holder back into profit. Identify Potential Risk: A clear break and close below $95,500 should be viewed as a significant bearish signal, potentially indicating further downside is likely.

2025-06-20T20:00:23,"This Metric Is Flashing a ‘Typically’ Bullish Signal for Bitcoin, According to Crypto Analytics Platform Santiment","Analytics firm Santiment is highlighting one metric that usually precedes a rally for Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other crypto assets. Santiment says the ratio of bullish king crypto sentiment to bearish sentiment from retail traders has reached a two-month low. A low ratio of the metric is “typically a bullish sign,” according to the analytics firm. “With crypto in a bit of a lull, traders are showing signs of impatience and bearish sentiment. There are just 1.03 bullish comments for every 1 bearish comment, which hasn’t happened since peak fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) during initial tariff reactions on April 6th… …Markets historically move in the opposite direction of retail’s expectations. A prime example was the optimal buy time during the early April fear from other traders.” Source: Santiment/X Santiment further says that the Middle East conflict involving Israel and Iran will “likely continue to cause volatile and unpredictable price action” for the crypto market. “Despite the initial panic, Bitcoin has remained in the $104,000 – $105,000 range, aided by consistent exchange-traded funds (ETF) inflows and a lack of follow-through in military actions, mirroring the typical ‘risk-off, then stabilize’ pattern seen in previous geopolitical crises.” Source: Santiment/X Bitcoin is trading at $104,431 at time of writing.

In a new interview with CNBC Television, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino says that if the firm were a nation of its own, it would be the 18th-largest holder of US Treasuries in the world. “Well, Tether in 2024 was the fifth-largest purchaser of US treasuries. And if we were a country, right, I mean, we compare ourselves to countries now, and as an overall statistic, Tether is the 18th-largest holder of US treasuries. We have around $125 billion in US treasuries. We are acquiring, that portion of our reserve is increasing… We think the trajectory is also in line with the GENIUS Act so we are very excited to see a stablecoin bill that provides clear guidance.” US Treasuries are debt obligations backed by the US Department of the Treasury that vary in maturation dates and pay interest every six months. They are considered low-risk investments due to being backed by the government. Ardoino goes on to note that the US dollar is still the safest currency in the world, adding that USDT will bring over 400 million people access to it. “By far, the US dollar is the safest fiat currency in the world… Between Bitcoin and stablecoins, they will make America stronger, and I think that is the main point of the [current] Administration.

2025-06-20T19:55:07,"CEO of Coinbase Brian Armstrong says that the world needs crypto now more than ever","The world is at crossroads, with debt growing exponentially, inflation crippling nations, and economic freedom declining. Amidst this uncertainty, the CEO of Coinbase, Brian Armstrong, is sounding an alarm that crypto can be a game-changer. Since Trump became President, markets have been unstable because of fears over the US Fed debt, inflation, and the added tariff menace. POTUS and the Fed’s chairman have been back and forth about the economy. Other than the US, other nations like Russia have reported slower economies and are also trying to fight inflation. It's no coincidence Bitcoin prices are at all-time highs. People are turning to Bitcoin as a refuge from inflation and deficit spending. It will ultimately be a check and balance on this activity. If this continues, Bitcoin could become the next world reserve currency. pic.twitter.com/Gr0hJDrWaN — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) June 20, 2025 Amidst all this, the crypto industry has thrived in most parts. In fact, the biggest coin, Bitcoin , has managed to maintain the 100k price for more than 40 days. Armstrong said, “ it’s no coincidence Bitcoin prices are at all-time highs. People are turning to Bitcoin as a refuge from inflation and deficit spending. The world needs crypto, now more than ever. “ BTC will soon grow to be the reserve currency – Armstrong According to Armstrong, the crypto industry is functioning in a way that, while Bitcoin is a store of value, stablecoins are the medium of exchange. He believes that holistic crypto adoption will take 10 to 15 years. Stablecoin legislation is navigating its way through the government. And Circle’s (CRCL) IPO was met with resounding enthusiasm. Armstrong said, “The stablecoin market cap is up 50%+ year-over-year, uncorrelated with crypto trading volume. […] This is crypto’s next daily use case, and it’s just the beginning. ” On the other hand, the Trump administration has moved to create a Bitcoin strategic reserve, though its framework remains to be determined. US companies such as GameStop (GME) and Strategy (MSTR) have been big buyers of Bitcoin to diversify their cash holdings. Trump Media & Technology (DJT) recently announced a plan to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin. Armstrong also said that he wants the US to remain in the reserve currency status. However, if the debt situation doesn’t get fixed eventually, Bitcoin will have to become the reserve currency for better or worse. He said that the Chinese RMB has no chance of becoming the reserve currency because they have their own debt problems. According to Statista, China’s total national debt is estimated at around $14.83 trillion in 2023. Coinbase strategies dedicated to Crypto Coinbase’s CEO said that they are focused on driving crypto adoption and growing the total addressable market. Their first strategy was directed towards Bitcoin, listing more assets, and now seeing real-world asset tokenization. Last year, RWA tokenization was up over 200x, with $20 billion now on-chain. He said that Coinbase is partnering with companies like Shopify to bring crypto payments to millions of merchants, further expanding the use of crypto in everyday transactions. Coinbase has created a Credit Card, powered by American Express, with up to 4% cashback paid in BTC. He added, “We’re not just putting a new UI on old rails. We’re building a new financial system from the ground up: new rails, new money, and new services like Bitcoin-backed loans using DeFi and stablecoin payments.” In addition, he said that the company is building a platform for the next generation of internet applications. According to him, the future of internet applications will be built on-chain. This allows value to flow directly to creators without intermediaries and platforms capturing most of the value. Meanwhile, the company’s first-quarter sales fell 24% from the prior year amid a slowdown in trading activity. Worthington rates Coinbase shares as Neutral with a $215 price target, suggesting 16% downside from current levels.

2025-06-20T19:50:36,"Bitcoin Price: Urgent Update as BTC Falls Below $104,000","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price: Urgent Update as BTC Falls Below $104,000 Hey crypto enthusiasts! The digital asset world is buzzing today, and not necessarily for the reasons many investors hoped. The Bitcoin price has experienced a notable dip, falling below the significant $104,000 mark. According to real-time market monitoring, the BTC price is currently trading around $103,909.99 on major exchanges like the Binance USDT market. Understanding the Latest Bitcoin Price Drop This recent Bitcoin drop below $104,000 is a key development that warrants close attention. While volatility is a hallmark of the crypto market, breaching specific price levels can trigger technical sell-offs or shift market sentiment. The $104,000 level may have been viewed by some traders as a support point, and its failure to hold could signal further downward potential in the short term. Several factors can contribute to sudden price movements in Bitcoin. Let’s explore some potential influences: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic uncertainty, inflation data, interest rate decisions by central banks, and geopolitical events can all impact investor risk appetite, leading to shifts away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Regulatory News: Announcements or rumors regarding stricter regulations on cryptocurrencies in major economies can create fear and uncertainty, prompting sell-offs. Large Liquidations: Significant liquidations of leveraged trading positions on exchanges can cascade, forcing more selling and accelerating a price decline. Market Sentiment Shifts: News cycles, social media trends, and overall investor confidence play a huge role. Negative sentiment can quickly spread, leading to panic selling. Technical Chart Patterns: Traders analyze charts for patterns and support/resistance levels. Breaking a key support level like $104,000 can trigger automated trading strategies designed to sell. What Factors Influence the BTC Price? Understanding the drivers behind the BTC price is crucial for anyone participating in the crypto market. It’s not just about supply and demand; it’s a complex interplay of global forces, technological developments, and human psychology. Here are some ongoing factors: Factor Influence on BTC Price Supply & Halvings Reduced new supply over time tends to be bullish long-term. Adoption Rates Increasing use by individuals, institutions, and businesses is bullish. Regulatory Landscape Clear, favorable regulations are bullish; restrictive ones are bearish. Technological Development Improvements to the network (e.g., scalability) can be bullish. Global Liquidity Availability of capital in the financial system can flow into crypto. While the current Bitcoin drop is concerning for some, it’s important to view it within the context of these broader factors and Bitcoin’s historical volatility. Navigating Crypto Market Volatility Price swings like the current Bitcoin drop are a stark reminder of the volatility inherent in the crypto market. For investors, this presents both challenges and potential opportunities. Challenges: Emotional stress and potential panic selling. Risk of significant losses, especially with leveraged positions. Difficulty in timing market entries and exits perfectly. Actionable Insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand the assets you invest in. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders. Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Long-Term Perspective: Many long-term investors focus on the fundamental technology and adoption rather than short-term price fluctuations. Stay Informed: Follow reliable cryptocurrency news sources to understand market drivers. This moment could be seen as a challenge for short-term traders, but for those with a long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s future, price dips can sometimes be viewed as potential accumulation opportunities. Staying Informed: The Importance of Cryptocurrency News In a fast-moving environment like the crypto market, staying updated through reliable cryptocurrency news is paramount. Knowing about regulatory shifts, technological updates, macroeconomic indicators, and significant on-chain movements can provide valuable context for price action, including the recent Bitcoin drop. Timely information helps investors make more informed decisions, avoid impulsive reactions based on fear or hype, and better understand the potential catalysts for future Bitcoin price movements. Conclusion: What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? The dip in Bitcoin price below $104,000 is a significant event for the market today. It highlights the inherent volatility and the influence of various global factors on digital asset valuations. While the immediate future price action remains uncertain, understanding the potential reasons behind this Bitcoin drop and adopting sound investment strategies are key for navigating these turbulent times. The crypto market continues to evolve, and price movements like this are a natural part of its growth trajectory.

2025-06-20T19:31:57,"CZ Highlights AI Deepfake Dangers as Hackers Target Trusted Link","Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has sounded a fresh alarm on the growing threat of AI-powered deepfakes, after a chilling real-life hack compromised Japanese crypto advocate Mai Fujimoto during a routine video call. The incident has renewed calls for stricter security habits as criminals wield advanced AI to breach even trusted communication channels. A Case Study in Modern Hacking On June 20, Fujimoto, better known online as Miss Bitcoin, narrated how she fell victim to a deepfake after being tricked into a Zoom call with an acquaintance whose Telegram account had already been compromised. According to her, the person on the video link was familiar, causing her to let down her guard. “For about 10 minutes in the online meeting, I saw her face but had no clue it was a deepfake,” Fujimoto recounted. However, there were audio issues with the call, prompting the deepfake impersonator to send a link supposedly meant to fix the problem. After clicking the link, Fujimoto unknowingly installed malware that compromised her Telegram and MetaMask. Her main X account was also hijacked, forcing her to plead with followers to report it as impersonation. She also warned users of the social platform not to click any links sent from the account. “If I had known about this kind of attack, I might not have clicked the link,” the crypto enthusiast lamented, urging widespread awareness. Her ordeal struck a chord across the crypto community, with influencers and security experts flooding X with stern reminders that in the age of AI, trust must be verified through multiple channels. CZ weighed in, too, warning his 10 million followers of the rampant use of artificial intelligence in new kinds of deepfake hackings. “Even a video call verification will soon be out of the window,” he cautioned, suggesting AI-generated impersonations will become harder to detect as the technology improves. The former Binance head urged users never to install software from unofficial links, even if they appear to come from friends. The Rise of AI-Powered Fraud The attack on Fujimoto is hardly isolated. A major report released by Bitget only days ago revealed that deepfake technology had played a role in nearly 40% of all high-value crypto frauds in 2024, contributing to at least $4.6 billion lost to scams. The study documented criminals using AI to create convincing fake videos of public figures like Elon Musk promoting scams, simulating customer service chats, and crucially, weaponizing video conferencing tools like Zoom with malicious links. Additionally, a different publication by Chainalysis noted that lawbreakers were increasingly using AI tools, including deepfakes, to bypass KYC measures and automate fraud, making crypto cons “increasingly difficult to detect.” In one such instance, Hong Kong police arrested 31 individuals linked to a syndicate that stole $34 million using AI-generated videos of crypto executives. Terrifyingly, the report warned that AI-driven swindles are poised to grow significantly.

Crypto Analyst Warns Of Bitcoin (BTC) Volatility As Swing Failure Patterns Emerge An analyst has pointed out a striking pattern on the Bitcoin (BTC) weekly chart, highlighting multiple Swing Failure Patterns. This visual analysis reveals each Swing Failure Pattern for Bitcoin (BTC) marked key inflection points, often signaling incoming rallies or deep corrections. Following a week of Bitcoin (BTC) drift, the price is stuck in a tight range. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading around $104,811. The chart’s projection implies that heightened volatility for Bitcoin (BTC) could be around the corner, with long-term downside potential not off the table. Chart Watch: Analyst Flags Hidden Divergence In Dogecoin (DOGE) An analyst has identified a hidden bullish divergence forming on Dogecoin’s (DOGE) daily chart. While the price of Dogecoin (DOGE) continues forming higher lows, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is printing lower lows, which often signals a potential continuation of an uptrend. Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently hovering around $0.1687, trading near a key support zone. With both regular and hidden divergences shown in past instances leading to significant upward moves, the latest signal could hint at an incoming bounce. Charting The Comeback: FLOKI’s (FLOKI) Bullish Wedge Signals Explosive Potential An analyst has noted a potentially bullish setup forming in the FLOKI (FLOKI) chart, drawing attention to a familiar pattern repeating itself. Previously, FLOKI (FLOKI) experienced a strong 174% bounce, and a similar structure appears to be unfolding again. Currently trading around $0.00007412, FLOKI (FLOKI) shows signs of another potential breakout as the price forms a descending wedge while RSI echoes the previous divergence.

2025-06-20T19:30:22,"Solana Analyst Sees $123 And $116 As Mid-Zone Support Levels – Here’s Why","Solana is currently testing a critical demand zone near the $150 level after enduring weeks of persistent selling pressure and a broader shift in market sentiment. The asset is now trading roughly 20% below its May high of $185, with recent attempts at recovery facing strong resistance. Despite holding above major support for now, the overall structure suggests that downside risk remains if market conditions don’t improve soon. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Eyes High Timeframe Close – Range Break Above $2,800 Could Be Violent Top analyst Efloud shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting the importance of tracking Solana’s response to broader Bitcoin dynamics. He noted that if Bitcoin (BTC) continues to consolidate sideways while Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) rises, altcoins like SOL may struggle. In that case, Solana could continue retracing to find stronger support at mid-zones, particularly around the $123 and $116 levels. These price zones have previously acted as solid support/resistance areas and could serve as key inflection points should bearish momentum persist. A breakdown toward these targets would likely coincide with increasing BTC.D and continued investor caution in the altcoin market. Until then, SOL remains vulnerable within a fragile technical structure, and traders will closely watch for either a rebound or deeper correction in the coming days. Solana Holds Key Support As Analysts Eye Bullish Scenarios Solana is currently trading about 50% down from its all-time highs, with the explosive momentum seen at the end of 2024 now replaced by more subdued price action. The asset’s underperformance has left investors cautious, but many analysts remain optimistic about Solana’s potential once a new altcoin rally begins. For now, the focus is on holding critical demand zones that could determine whether SOL is gearing up for a recovery or further downside. According to Efloud, if Bitcoin continues consolidating sideways while Bitcoin dominance rises, Solana may find support at several mid-zones, particularly around $123 and $116. The $140 region has historically acted as a strong support/resistance flip, and a deviation around this level—losing it briefly before regaining it with strength—could present a short-term buying opportunity. Efloud notes that this scenario doesn’t necessarily imply that SOL must drop to those levels, but current market conditions—aside from Bitcoin—lack strong pair structures. If SOL can decisively break above the $168 resistance, a new leg upward could be triggered, with $230 potentially acting as the next major resistance zone. On the SOL/BTC pair, Efloud is watching for a reclaim of the 0.0015 level or a pullback toward 0.00115 for confirmation. Another key support sits at 0.000988 sats. Despite the current cooling, the structure may still offer solid opportunities for new entrants. If these levels hold and macro conditions improve, SOL could be setting the stage for a sustainable rally, ultimately leading to new all-time highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Mirrors Bitcoin 2017-2021 Pattern – $4,000 Is The Trigger Point Weekly Chart Analysis – Holding the Line Near Key Support Solana is currently trading at $148.33 on the weekly timeframe, showing a 3% decline over the past seven days. The price has dropped roughly 20% from its May high of around $185 and is now testing the critical $140–$150 support zone. This level has repeatedly acted as a pivot point in the past and could define SOL’s short-term trajectory. The chart shows that Solana has been unable to reclaim the 50-week moving average (currently near $170), which now acts as key resistance. A decisive weekly close above this level would open the door for a bullish continuation toward $185 and possibly $200. However, failure to hold above the 100-week moving average around $132 could lead to further downside pressure, with $123 and $116 as the next demand zones to watch—levels identified by analyst Efloud in his mid-zone scenario. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates as Realized Profits Stay Low – No Signs Of Major Sell-Off Yet Volume has declined steadily over the past three weeks, signaling reduced participation, but also suggesting that aggressive selling is fading. If bulls manage to reclaim $160 with conviction, the structure remains favorable. For now, SOL remains in a consolidation phase, awaiting either a breakout or further correction as broader crypto market conditions unfold.

2025-06-20T19:20:06,"Project Eleven Raises $6M to Guard Bitcoin From Quantum Hacks","Project Eleven, a post-quantum cryptography startup, has raised $6 million from Variant Fund, Quantonation, and top crypto VCs to develop the tools and standards needed to protect Bitcoin and the broader digital asset ecosystem from future quantum computing attacks. With over $600 billion in BTC potentially exposed, the project’s roadmap is now at the center of crypto’s security conversation. Why Quantum Threats Matter for Bitcoin—And Why Now Quantum computers are rapidly advancing, and experts warn that within a decade, machines could emerge that can break Bitcoin’s elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) using Shor’s algorithm. According to Project Eleven and YCharts, more than 10 million Bitcoin addresses with non-zero balances have already exposed their public keys, putting over 6 million BTC—worth about $648 billion—at theoretical risk if quantum computers reach “Q-Day” capabilities. “As quantum computing capabilities advance, the threat to systems like Bitcoin is no longer theoretical, it’s imminent. This funding allows us to stay ahead of that curve, building the tools, standards, and ecosystem required to ensure digital assets remain secure in a post-quantum world.” — Alex Pruden, CEO, Project Eleven Yellowpages and Migration Without a Hard Fork Project Eleven’s flagship product, Yellowpages , is a cryptographic registry designed to let users proactively secure their Bitcoin against quantum threats—without waiting for a network-wide protocol upgrade. Here’s how it works: Users generate a new, quantum-resistant key pair using post-quantum cryptography (such as lattice-based algorithms). They create a cryptographic proof linking their current Bitcoin address to the new quantum-safe address, without exposing sensitive information or moving funds on-chain. This proof is timestamped and registered in Yellowpages, an off-chain, publicly verifiable registry that acts as a fallback if quantum computers ever compromise Bitcoin’s existing keys. Yellowpages has already been audited by Cure 53, and Project Eleven is in discussions with Bitcoin Core developers about integrating post-quantum migration tools into future wallet software. Unlike proposals like QRAMP, which would require a hard fork and broad consensus, Yellowpages offers a way for users and institutions to migrate at their own pace—potentially sidestepping years of governance gridlock. What Miners, Wallets, and Exchanges Must Do The migration to post-quantum security is not just a technical challenge—it’s a community-wide coordination problem. Miners and exchanges will need to: Update wallet infrastructure to support quantum-resistant key generation and proof registration. Educate users about the risks of exposed public keys and the steps needed to secure their assets. Monitor for “Q-Day” signals and be ready to accelerate migration if quantum breakthroughs occur. Wallet providers, especially those serving institutions and high-net-worth clients, are expected to be the first to integrate Yellowpages and related tools. Exchanges may also require proof of quantum-safe migration for large withdrawals or cold storage. The $1 BTC Bounty and the Race to Q-Day To benchmark the quantum threat, Project Eleven has launched the Q-Day Prize —offering 1 BTC to the first team that can break a toy version of Bitcoin’s cryptography using Shor’s algorithm on a quantum computer. This challenge, running through April 2026, aims to provide real-world data on how close the quantum threat truly is and to incentivize researchers to stress-test existing defenses. What’s Next for Quantum-Resistant Crypto With $6 million in new funding, Project Eleven plans to expand its team, accelerate Yellowpages adoption, and develop additional standards for post-quantum security across digital assets. The company is also exploring quantum-resistant applications for secure messaging and decentralized communications. The broader crypto industry is watching closely. As quantum hardware advances, the pressure to migrate will only intensify. The next 2–5 years will be critical: those who prepare now could weather the quantum storm, while those who wait may find themselves locked out of their own wallets. The Bottom Line Project Eleven’s $6 million war chest marks a turning point in Bitcoin’s defense against quantum threats. With user-friendly migration tools, open-source audits, and a pragmatic approach to community adoption, the path to a quantum-resistant Bitcoin is finally coming into focus. The question is: will the ecosystem move fast enough?",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9647/project-eleven-raises-6-m-to-guard-bitcoin-from-quantum-hacks,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|FORKS","News|Legal",cryptocompare
2025-06-20T19:15:20,"Arizona Edges Closer To Building Bitcoin Reserve From Seized Crypto As Revived Bill Passes In Senate","Arizona lawmakers revived and voted to advance House Bill 2324 (HB 2324), a proposed legislation to create a state-managed reserves fund for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies seized through criminal forfeiture. The bill, which is now cleared to head to the House for the final vote, passed the Senate on Thursday in a narrow 16-14 vote. The legislation failed a final vote in the House in May and was returned to the Senate for revisions. If passed, the bill would authorize the State Treasurer to create the Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund to manage crypto assets seized through criminal asset forfeiture. The fund would allow the state government to invest funds in crypto assets or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) holding digital assets. Under the proposed distribution structure, the first $300,000 from seized digital asset sales would go to the Anti-Racketeering Revolving Fund. If the sale surpasses that amount, the remaining balance would be split, with 50% going to the Attorney General, 25% to the state general fund, and 25% to the new Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund. The bill modifies Arizona’s forfeiture laws to include procedures for securing lawfully confiscated crypto assets. It requires authorities to either obtain credentials like private keys or seed phrases or move them to a state-approved digital wallet. HB 2324 will need to secure a majority vote from the 60 Arizona House members, 33 of whom are Republicans, for approval to send it to Governor Katie Hobbs’ desk. Arizona is one of many states that have introduced crypto-related legislation since President Donald Trump’s return to office, inspired by a broader national push to establish digital asset frameworks at the state level. New Hampshire is the only state to have successfully completed the legislative process for establishing a BTC reserve. Notably, a bill in Texas, like Arizona, is also in its final stages . Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate recently passed the landmark GENIUS stablecoin bill , which is now headed to the House for further consideration. President Trump urged the House to pass the GENIUS Act as soon as possible so he can officially sign it into law, calling it essential to securing America’s standing as the “undisputed leader” in crypto assets.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/arizona-edges-closer-to-building-bitcoin-reserve-from-seized-crypto-as-revived-bill-passes-in-senate/,"BTC|FIAT|REGULATION","Cryptocurrency|News|arizona|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

The latest $51.5 million PIPE round proves investors are all-in on the crypto pivot, even as skeptics question the long-term play. KindlyMD and Nakamoto Holdings, the Bitcoin ( BTC )-focused investment firm founded by David Bailey, announced on June 20 that they have secured an additional $51.5 million in PIPE financing, bringing their total committed capital for Bitcoin treasury accumulation to $763 million. The latest round, priced at $5 per share in KindlyMD stock, was fully subscribed in under 72 hours, signaling strong institutional interest despite broader market uncertainty. “Investor demand for Nakamoto is incredibly strong. This additional financing was raised in under 72 hours, adding the option for more working capital in addition to acquiring bitcoin. We continue to execute our strategy to raise as much capital as possible to acquire as much bitcoin as possible,” David Bailey, Founder and CEO of Nakamoto, said. You might also like: Solana, Aptos tie for top spot in Wyoming’s hunt for WYST stablecoin partner According to the statement, KindlyMD will use the funds to purchase Bitcoin and bolster working capital once its expected merger with Nakamoto closes following shareholder approval. Nakamoto’s latest capital raise is part of a broader trend: corporations are stockpiling Bitcoin at an unprecedented pace. The number of companies executing formal Bitcoin treasury strategies now exceeds 220, according to public filings and data from BitcoinTreasuries.net. That list includes Strategy, the Michael Saylor-led firm that pioneered corporate BTC accumulation during the pandemic, as well as relative newcomers like Semler Scientific and Metaplanet, which are deploying capital into BTC as both a treasury reserve and a long-term hedge against inflation and currency debasement. However, while institutional investor appetite for Bitcoin continues to rise, analysts warn that BTC-focused corporate treasuries pose various risks, including liquidity concerns, regulatory uncertainties and crypto market’s notorious volatility, which can force firms to sell at a loss in bear markets.
