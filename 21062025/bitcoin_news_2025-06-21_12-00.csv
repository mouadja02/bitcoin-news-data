2025-06-21T09:58:47,"Norway Considers Temporary Ban on Crypto Mining to Address Energy Strain","The Norwegian government is weighing a temporary ban on cryptocurrency mining, citing concerns over electricity consumption, network capacity, and land use. In a notice issued Friday, officials announced that a formal investigation will be conducted in the autumn to evaluate the potential impact of mining operations. The outcome could lead to a temporary halt on such activities, aimed at redirecting resources toward more essential public and industrial needs. The potential ban would be under Norway’s Planning and Building Act, a legislative tool that allows the government to allocate energy usage and infrastructure. “It is uncertain how big a problem crypto mining will become in Norway in the future,” the government said, adding that newly introduced data center regulations requiring registration will help clarify the scope and footprint of crypto-related facilities. Rising Electricity Costs Norwegian households, like many across Europe, have seen a sharp increase in electricity prices over the past two years, largely driven by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent disruption in oil and gas supplies. This has added urgency to national efforts to prioritize energy allocation and limit non-essential power consumption . Local communities have also voiced frustrations over the noise generated by crypto mining farms, with several petitions calling for shutdowns of such operations. While mining may bring in revenue and investment, many argue it offers little social benefit and places an unnecessary burden on already strained infrastructure. Norway to Ban Mining? Norway’s proposal echoes similar moves in other regions. Earlier this year, Russia imposed mining bans across 10 regions to prevent power outages and reduce energy stress. China, once the global leader in Bitcoin mining, implemented a blanket ban in 2021, pushing many miners to relocate to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions like Texas in the United States. Despite ongoing environmental concerns, crypto mining remains legal across most of the U.S., where it continues to contribute significantly to the global Bitcoin hashrate. Lawmakers have raised questions about sustainability, but regulatory action has been sporadic and state-specific. For now, Norway’s move signals a growing shift among European nations toward reevaluating the energy-intensive nature of crypto mining.

2025-06-21T09:48:56,"Bitcoin Falls Below $104K as Retail Investor Sentiment Returns to Liberation Day Levels","Bitcoin (BTC) BTC continues to struggle for direction amid mounting macroeconomic pressures and a notable deterioration in retail investor sentiment. The asset is hovering near $103,700 following a volatile 24-hour stretch, in which it briefly dropped below $103,400 before staging a modest recovery, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. This price behavior reflects an uneasy market backdrop, shaped by both geopolitical tensions and uncertain monetary policy. According to an X post by crypto analytics firm Santiment on Thursday, sentiment among retail investors has turned sharply negative. The firm reported that the ratio of bullish to bearish commentary has fallen to just 1.03 to 1 — the lowest since early April, when the President Donald Trump unveiled his so-called Liberation Day tariffs, triggering peak market fear at the time. Santiment emphasized that this current wave of retail pessimism is unusually intense and, based on past patterns, may mark a contrarian signal for a price rebound. They specifically noted that back in April, Bitcoin rallied shortly after similar fear levels surfaced, suggesting large investors often use periods of retail capitulation to accumulate at favorable prices. Adding to the pressure is the Federal Reserve's recent decision to hold interest rates steady, which has kept btcoin trading in a relatively tight $100,000 to $110,000 range over the past month. Meanwhile, on-chain metrics show declining open interest on Binance, pointing to continued deleveraging among derivatives traders. At the same time, whale wallets have shown steady accumulation since 2023 — an indication that large holders are continuing to build their positions despite the short-term uncertainty. Technical Analysis Highlights BTC-USD traded in a 24-hour range between $106,552.98 and $102,411.01, a 3.89% swing as volatility spiked midday. A sharp drop occurred between 14:00 and 17:00 UTC, pushing price below $104,000 and forming strong resistance near $106,000 on above-average volume. Support emerged between $103,000 and $103,500, where price consolidated on declining volume during the final eight hours of the analysis period. A V-shaped rebound developed late in the session, with BTC rising from $103,363 to $103,618 and establishing a local floor near $103,500. Short-term momentum indicators showed mild recovery as the session closed near intraday highs, but follow-through remained limited.

Long-term forecasts suggest potential highs of $35.60 by 2030. Worldcoin made waves in early 2024 when its token WLD nearly hit $12, but since then, it has struggled to break past key resistance levels, even during bullish market events. With price action losing steam and investor interest fading, many wonder if the project is losing its shine. As it is backed by Sam Altman and focused on decentralized identity, Worldcoin is quietly building in the background. working hard in silence, maybe with the ongoing AI crypto bull run gaining momentum, Sam Altman’s brainchild, Worldcoin, could possibly create a significant buzz. As AI narratives gain traction, many are intrigued to know, “What does the future hold for Worldcoin?” or “Could WLD stage a comeback?” Let’s delve into the anticipated Worldcoin price predictions for 2025 to 2030 and the years to come Table of contents Overview CoinPedia’s WLD Price Prediction Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025 WLD Price Forecast 2026 – 2030 Worldcoin Price Forecast 2026 WLD Price Prediction 202 7 Worldcoin Price Forecast 2028 WLD AI Token Price Forecast 2029 Worldcoin AI Token Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency WorldCoin WDC Token WDC Price $ 0.00349731 -10.28% Market Cap $ 0.00 Circulating Supply 0.00 Trading Volume $ 5.1958 All-time High $11.82 on 10th March 2024 All-time Low $0.9758 on 13th September 2023 CoinPedia’s WLD Price Prediction As per Coinpedia’s Worldcoin Price Prediction, marketers’ optimism and the involvement of high-profile figures could significantly boost Worldcoin’s potential value. Further, this credibility and backing, combined with a potential increase in trading volume, could drive the price of WLD Coin to an impressive $5.89 by the end of 2025. If the market faces external pressures, then it could potentially drive the price down to a low of $1.61 . Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2025 1.61 3.25 5.89 Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025 The Q2 2025 price action for Worldcoin (WLD) clearly showed signs of exhaustion before it could push higher. Despite recent optimism, its inability to establish a sustained, long-term bullish trend remains evident. Looking at its historical performance, the recent Q2’s gains appear modest, like a mere bucket of water from a deep well. Since early 2024, WLD is still down over 80% from its highs, even with the latest price surge. The entire weekly price action on the Binance exchange resembles a converging price action structure in a falling channel. This pattern occurrence highlights the odds of future good returns remaining high. When a catalyst activates, it will shoot a breakout from this range. Many are now asking: What could truly push Worldcoin higher? As seen time and again in the crypto space, social sentiment is often the key driver. Renewed marketing efforts and the involvement of high-profile figures could significantly enhance Worldcoin’s value. If, in the coming sessions, optimistic momentum builds up, then WLD must achieve a Change of Character (ChoCh) in its current price structure by breaking above the $2.12 level in June or July. Once this level is cleared and a ChoCh is confirmed, Worldcoin could break out of its bearish pattern and potentially retest the $4.18 level by the end of 2025. However, if WLD fails to maintain a bullish trajectory this year, its price could drop as low as $0.70.

2025-06-21T09:32:13,"Bitcoin Demand Momentum Shows Bears Are Giving Up – Price Reversal Ahead?","The post Bitcoin Demand Momentum Shows Bears Are Giving Up – Price Reversal Ahead? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News June 21, 2025 – Bitcoin might be gearing up for a massive breakout—and it’s not just about technical patterns or ETF news this time. A sharp shift in demand momentum and rising Global Liquidity Index (GLI) has caught the eye of veteran analyst Crypto Rover. Let’s break down what the latest signals are telling us. Bears Are Backing Off, Bulls Taking Over According to a chart shared by Crypto Rover, Bitcoin’s demand momentum has plunged deep into negative territory. In simple words, short-term sellers are pulling back, while long-term holders are stepping in. Historically, this kind of shift tends to happen near market bottoms, often just before big price rallies. The bears are capitulating. Bitcoin demand momentum is deep in the red. A reversal is imminent! pic.twitter.com/3Nf0GmTJDH — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) June 21, 2025 At the same time, Bitcoin’s trading volume jumped 20% in the past 24 hours, reaching $47 billion . The spike in volume reflects a mix of panic selling and opportunistic buying, a classic sign of bear capitulation. Adding to the bullish signs, major players are placing bold bets. One whale, in particular, is holding a massive 20x long position on Bitcoin , valued at over $364.35 million, reflecting a growing confidence in BTC. Liquidity and Bitcoin in Sync Interestingly, Rover also compared recent Bitcoin’s price to global liquidity trends. Historically, when global liquidity rises, Bitcoin tends to follow suit, sometimes with explosive results. Notably, the current Global Liquidity Index (GLI) level mirrors the period when Bitcoin was trading around $100,000, implying that if the pattern holds, Bitcoin could soon revisit or even surpass this price point. Bitcoin will explode. Just like the global liquidity did. Watch this chart closely! pic.twitter.com/E5PRD48R3S — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) June 21, 2025 What Should Traders Watch Next? Volume Trends: Sustained high trading volumes could confirm that the capitulation phase is ending, signaling that selling pressure is subsiding. Support Levels: The $103,400 level remains a critical support zone. Holding above this threshold is essential for a bullish reversal. Technical Indicators: Watch for bullish crossovers in the MACD and RSI moving out of oversold territory, currently at 45 . As of now, Bitcoin is trading around $103.693, reflecting a drop of 2.2% seen in the last 24 hours, with a market cap hitting $2.06 trillion.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-demand-momentum-shows-bears-are-giving-up-reversal-ahead/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-21T09:30:17,"XRP Price Crash Tests Critical Support At $2.1, Will It Break?","After the market crash that sent the Bitcoin price falling toward $100,000, the XRP price also saw a notable decline, and this crash has brought it toward an important level. While the digital asset continues to hold above the $2.1 level, it remains critical support and a break below this could be negative for the price. This is outlined by crypto analyst The Alchemist Trader, who has shown what direction the XRP price could be headed in depending on what happens here. XRP Price Threatens Major Support Level After the almost 4.5% decline that ravaged the XRP price over the last week, it has been pushed down toward the next major support level, lying just above $2.09. So far, the bulls have defended this level, but the multiple tests suggest that a breakdown at this level could be in view. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts 20% Ethereum Price Crash Below $2,000, Here’s Why The analyst explains that the reason this level is so important is that it actually includes the value area low recorded in previous declines. Additionally, it is the 200-day moving average (MA) for the cryptocurrency, and also now serves as a key daily support/resistance flip. This means either camp of the bulls and bears can pull it in their direction, making it incredibly important for what happens to the XRP price in the short term. Given the importance of this level, whether it holds or breaks will carry serious implications for the XRP price. In the bearish scenario, the crypto analyst explains that a break below this support would trigger a liquidity sweep as the price dumps lower. The possibility of a break is even higher now, given that this level has already been tested multiple times. The Alchemist explains that each test weakens the level, putting it at risk of a breakdown. However, with long consolidation so far above this level, there is a bullish scenario that is rising. As bulls continue to maintain this support, further strength here could erode the possibility of a decline. If properly defended with a notable uptick in volume, in addition to a move upward into the recent local highs at $2.4, then it is likely that the XRP price continues to move up. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Wave Towards ATH Coming? Here Are The Targets “For bulls, a clean defense of this level with volume and a move back above recent local highs would indicate a potential rotation toward the next resistance,” the analysis read. “For bears, a breakdown without a reclaim increases the likelihood of continuation to the downside.” As for how to play the current trend, the analyst advises investors to exercise caution and wait for confirmation before taking positions. The confirmation here would either be a break below the support or a strong upward rally away from it, signaling a clear direction.

2025-06-21T09:15:50,"Litecoin, XRP and Solana ETF Applications Have 95% Chance of Approval This Year: Bloomberg Analysts","Litecoin ( LTC ), XRP and Solana ( SOL ) exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications all have overwhelming odds of approval this year, according to Bloomberg ETF analysts. James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas now say on the social media platform X that those three altcoins have a 95% chance of securing ETFs in 2025. They also give potential Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Cardano ( ADA ), Polkadot ( DOT ), Hedera ( HBAR ) and Avalanche ( AVAX ) ETFs a 90% chance of approval. A Sui ( SUI ) ETF application from the crypto asset manager Canary Capital has slightly lower odds, at 60%, and a Canary Tron ( TRX ) bid doesn’t have any chance in 2025, according to the analysts. Source: James Seyffart/X Seyffart also notes that Ethereum ( ETH ) staking ETFs are also “extremely likely” to be approved in 2025. Numerous other ETF applications have been filed for potential funds based on Axelar ( AXL ), BNB , Aptos ( APT ), Chainlink ( LINK ), Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ), Official Trump ( TRUMP ), Melania ( MELANIA ) and Bonk ( BONK ). Other potential new ETFs are tied to a basket of currencies, and a few are based on Bitcoin ( BTC ) and/or Ethereum, assets that have already been approved for inclusion in other spot ETFs. The SEC greenlit the first spot market Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, bringing in billions of dollars worth of inflows to the top digital asset by market cap. The regulator subsequently approved Ethereum ETFs for trading last July.

2025-06-21T09:08:55,"Bitcoin’s plunge triggered $495 million in liquidations","Bitcoin (BTC) plummeted to its lowest point this week, triggering almost half a billion worth of liquidations and rattling the crypto market as geopolitical tensions and heavy selling pressure spooked traders. The BTC price slipped back to the $102k zone before regaining the crucial $103k mark. The global digital assets market cap dropped by 2% over the past 24 hours to stand at $3.2 trillion. Its 24-hour trading volume surged by 40% to hit $112 billion, suggesting that traders are moving their funds quickly amid surging uncertainties. However, the fear and greed index flashes “neutral” sentiment among the investors. Liquidations soar to $500M The day that began with Bitcoin hitting $106K saw it dropping below $103,000 in a matter of hours. The pullback wasn’t limited to BTC as Ethereum (ETH) plunged by as much as 4.5% in just a couple of hours. ETH price fell to a low of $2,375 as its trading volumes spiked by 89% to hit $22 billion. Ether is trading at an average price of $2,425 with a marginal recovery. Solana, Cardano, and the biggest meme crypto, Dogecoin, were also swept up in the selloff. Their price dropped between 3% and 5% during the same session. Meanwhile, Sei has turned out to be the biggest gainer among the top 100 crypto. Sei price is up by 10% in the last 24 hours and is trading around $0.22 at press time. The sell-off has triggered widespread liquidations across the crypto derivatives market. CoinGlass data shows that 127k traders got liquidated over the last 24 hours, as the liquidations went on to hit $495 million. The single largest liquidation order of BTC/USD valued at $8 million happened on Bybit. Source: CoinGlass Around $413 million worth of liquidated positions (84%) turn out to be long bets. This suggests that traders were hoping that bullish momentum would continue ahead, but the cumulative crypto market printed red indexes. Ethereum liquidations outpaced Bitcoin’s, totaling $177 million compared to Bitcoin’s $122 million. Bitcoin is trading at an average price of $103,485 at press time, which traders have been watching closely for a while. Its 24-hour trading volume is up by 34% to stand at $48.8 billion. Bitcoin’s overheating zone cleared? According to CryptoQuant data , the heatmap chart tells the story that the $103K liquidation cluster, which previously acted as a concentration point for overleveraged long positions, was completely dismantled. As Bitcoin broke through this key level, a sharp wick pushed prices below $102,500, flushing out traders who had entered long positions with insufficient margin or poor risk management. Binance’s liquidation delta chart corroborates this move, showing a pronounced spike of over $160 million in long liquidations within minutes of the breakdown. Simultaneously, Binance’s Net Taker Volume, smoothed over a seven-hour moving average. It plunged deeply into negative territory, hitting nearly negative $100 million. It’s the third time this month the metric has nosedived to such extremes. The metric showed that the sell-off may have felt brutal in the moment, but events like these can ultimately be constructive. Aggressive liquidations and deep negative taker volumes typically signal that speculative excess has been flushed from the system. It suggests that the removal of weak-handed leverage can make the way for more stable price action.

2025-06-21T09:08:31,"Bitcoin Hyper Presale Heats Up Ahead of Fed Rate Cut","Bitcoin has been comfortably cruising in six-figure territory for a while now. And the next big milestone on everyone’s radar is $120K. With fresh rate-cut rumors swirling around the Federal Reserve, the setup for a continued rally is starting to look eerily perfect. Rate cuts have historically pumped risk assets, and Bitcoin loves nothing more than a dovish Fed. Add global trade tensions and war-related uncertainty into the mix, and the pressure on the Fed to act is growing. But while Bitcoin steals the spotlight, the real hidden gem might be quietly building in the background. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a lightning-fast, Solana-compatible Layer-2 designed to scale $BTC – and it might just be the infrastructure play of this bull run. A Bullish Setup, Thanks to the Fed There’s a storm of macro news brewing – and surprisingly, it’s bullish for crypto. The Federal Reserve, after months of playing hardball on inflation, may finally be loosening its grip. Recent comments from Fed officials and fresh rate-cut speculation for July have markets buzzing. The reason? A double-whammy of war tensions and trade tariffs could drag down global growth, forcing the Fed to pivot. Historically, rate cuts weaken the dollar and light a fire under risk assets. And Bitcoin, being the king of risk-on trades, thrives on this kind of chaos. According to analysts, $BTC could ride this wave all the way to $120K if the Fed blinks. But what happens when Bitcoin actually starts running again? What Is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER)? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the Layer-2 solution that finally gives Bitcoin its long-overdue upgrade.Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), it’s not a sidechain or half-measure – it’s a fully operational blockchain engineered to scale Bitcoin in a way that actually works. For the first time, developers, degens, and builders can create lightning-fast, low-cost dApps directly on the Bitcoin ecosystem. Think of it like this: Bitcoin is the vault. Bitcoin Hyper is the high-speed highway connected to it – one that unlocks sub-second transaction speeds and near-zero gas fees. It’s the first real execution layer for Bitcoin, turning it from a passive store of value into an active financial playground. Now, Bitcoin can support payments, meme coins , NFTs, DAOs, and DeFi – all under one roof. And it’s all cross-chain from day one. Apps and assets can move across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana without friction. With SVM compatibility baked in, Bitcoin Hyper brings serious dev firepower and full compatibility with the Solana ecosystem. With the Fed hinting at a rate cut, the timing couldn’t be better. If Bitcoin surges, the infrastructure around it, especially one this fast and meme-ready, could take off even faster. Why $HYPER Buyers Could Win Big – But Only If They Move Now At just $0.011975, Bitcoin Hyper is still in presale, but it’s not going unnoticed. This new crypto project has already raised over $1.4M, and that early-stage window is closing fast. Analysts predict $HYPER could hit as high as $0.32 by the end of 2025. That’s a potential 2,570% increase from today’s presale price. Let’s do the math. Say you buy $1K worth of $HYPER at the current price. You’d get roughly 83,5K tokens. Bitcoin Hyper plans to offer staking with competitive APYs. Let’s go with a modest estimate of 20% APY. Stake those tokens for a year, and you’d earn an extra 16,7K tokens, bringing your total to 100,2K $HYPER. At today’s price, that’s still $1,2K. But if the price hits $0.32 by the end of 2025? You’re sitting on $32K – all from a $1K investment and one year of staking. And that’s not counting early access to token launches, staking pools, governance, and other utility perks presale buyers get. This is how early plays turn into power positions. With $BTC momentum climbing, $HYPER could be one of the best altcoins to ride this wave. The Bitcoin Boom Is Here – But the Real Opportunity Is Under the Hood With the Fed pivot in sight and Bitcoin heating up, the next bull run isn’t a matter of if – it’s when. But when the market takes off, it’s not just $BTC that flies. It’s the infrastructure around it. That’s where Bitcoin Hyper shines. It’s not trying to replace Bitcoin, it’s here to power the ecosystem with real speed, real apps, and real scalability. While others chase hype, $HYPER is laying the foundation. And when the market stampede begins, the ones who build the rails get there first. This article is for informational purposes and doesn’t constitute financial advice.

2025-06-21T08:55:12,"CoinMarketCap Hacked, Scrambles to Remove Malicious Wallet Verification Popup","CoinMarketCap was hacked on Friday after a malicious popup appeared on its website, urging users to “verify” their wallets. Key Takeaways: CoinMarketCap was hacked after a fake wallet verification popup appeared on its site, triggering phishing concerns. MetaMask and Phantom flagged the site as unsafe, warning users against connecting wallets. The breach has revived criticism of CoinMarketCap’s security, nearly four years after its major data leak. The phishing-style notification asked users to connect their wallets and approve ERC-20 token access, raising immediate red flags across the crypto community. Wallet providers like MetaMask and Phantom quickly flagged the site as unsafe, with Phantom displaying a browser warning against using the platform. CoinMarketCap Removes Malicious Popup In a Friday post on X , CoinMarketCap confirmed the removal of the malicious popup. “We’ve identified and removed the malicious code from our site,” the platform said. The company added that it is continuing to investigate the breach and is reinforcing its security measures to prevent similar incidents. Update: We've identified and removed the malicious code from our site. Our team is continuing to investigate and taking steps to strengthen our security. — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) June 21, 2025 The malicious prompt, which triggered warnings from wallet providers like MetaMask and Phantom, reportedly asked users to connect their wallets and approve access to ERC-20 tokens. Phantom’s browser extension even flagged CoinMarketCap as “unsafe to use,” raising concerns about the platform’s vulnerability. Reports of the phishing attempt began circulating across crypto social media, with several users alerting others not to interact with the prompt. Many suspected the attack was an attempt to steal wallet credentials through a fake interface mimicking a legitimate verification process. The incident has reignited concerns about CoinMarketCap’s security, coming nearly four years after a 2021 data breach exposed the email addresses of over 3.1 million users. That data was later discovered for sale on hacking forums, prompting criticism over the platform’s safeguards. SECURITY ALERT We're seeing reports that @CoinMarketCap 's front end has been compromised and is trying to trick people into linking their wallets, presumably to drain them. pic.twitter.com/a0JREDSPvS — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) June 20, 2025 CoinMarketCap, owned by Binance, remains one of the most widely used resources in the crypto space, making it a prime target for malicious actors looking to exploit its credibility. Users are urged to avoid connecting wallets to unsolicited prompts and to verify all interactions through official channels. The company has not disclosed the source of the breach but has committed to ongoing security reviews. Crypto Crime Turns Violent as Illicit Transactions Top $40B in 2024 Illicit cryptocurrency activity surged to at least $40.9 billion in 2024, according to Chainalysis, with the number likely to grow as more criminal-linked wallets are identified. Hacks alone accounted for $2.2 billion in stolen assets, a 21% increase from the previous year. North Korean-linked groups, including Lazarus and Tradetraitor, were behind over 60% of those thefts, with major incidents like the $300 million hack of Japan’s DMM Bitcoin exchange among their hits. But the threats go beyond online exploits. Criminal groups are using crypto to fund and conceal a wider range of crimes—from investment scams and AI-enhanced romance frauds to drug trafficking and even physical violence. In one alarming case on May 13, 2025, the daughter and grandson of Paymium’s CEO were nearly kidnapped in Paris by masked men.

The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Bitcoin: Pioneering a New Era of Digital Currency Bitcoin, often dubbed the world's first cryptocurrency, has revolutionized the way we think about money. Introduced by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, it offers a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that operates without a central authority. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin isn't printed or minted; it's a digital asset maintained by a distributed network of computers called nodes. Transactions are verified by miners through a process of solving complex puzzles, ensuring the integrity and security of the network. This innovative system removes the need for intermediaries like banks, making transactions faster and potentially more secure. As we navigate the current market cycle, Bitcoin's potential continues to spark interest. The network undergoes a ""halving"" approximately every four years, reducing the reward for miners by half. This process, designed to cap the total supply at 21 million bitcoins, can influence the network's stability and mining profitability. Compared to newer cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin remains the most established and widely recognized. Its limited supply and increasing adoption suggest a resilient future, though the market remains volatile. Whether Bitcoin is an attractive option now depends on individual perspectives, but its pioneering technology and growing role in the financial world are hard to ignore. ADA Coin: Cardano's Green Revolution in the Crypto World Cardano is shaking up the cryptocurrency scene. It's a platform built for smart contracts, making it easy to create apps, tokens, and games without middlemen. Its coin, ADA, competes with Ethereum's ETH. With ADA, users can store value, make payments, and help secure the network by staking. What makes Cardano special is its eco-friendly approach. It uses proof-of-stake, which is much more energy-efficient than the methods used by many other cryptocurrencies. In today's market, ADA shows great promise. Cardano's technology allows fast transactions, potentially handling up to a million per second. This speed comes from its unique two-layer system, separating transactions from smart contracts. Since 2021, Cardano's native tokens have made interactions with smart contracts safer and cheaper. As the crypto world moves towards sustainability and efficiency, ADA stands out. It's an attractive option for those interested in the future of cryptocurrency. Monero: Your Money, Your Business Monero (XMR) was launched in 2014 with a clear goal: to let people make private transactions. While many think Bitcoin hides their identity, it's actually easy to trace payments back because blockchains are open for all to see. Monero changes this by using advanced cryptography to hide both the sender and the receiver. The team behind Monero puts privacy and security first. They want everyone to have protection, no matter how tech-savvy they are. Monero aims to let payments happen quickly and cheaply, without fear of censorship. In a world where digital footprints are everywhere, Monero offers a way to keep your financial dealings to yourself. This makes it stand out from other cryptocurrencies that are less private. With growing concerns about data privacy, Monero's technology has big potential. In the current market, where regulations are tightening, a coin like Monero could become more attractive. It provides a level of anonymity that others don't. As more people seek privacy, Monero might see increased interest compared to more transparent coins. Chainlink: Bridging Blockchains with the Real World Chainlink is changing how smart contracts work. It connects them to real-world data, like prices and events. This makes them more useful and powerful. Chainlink uses a network of oracles to fetch and verify data. These oracles have a reputation score to ensure the data is accurate. The system combines on-chain and off-chain processes. On-chain, it manages data requests. Off-chain, it gathers the data. The LINK token powers this ecosystem. It rewards those who provide data and keeps the network secure through staking. In the current market, Chainlink stands out. Its ability to connect blockchains with external data fills a crucial gap. As more decentralized apps emerge, the need for reliable data grows. Unlike some coins that offer limited utility, LINK has a clear purpose. Its technology is mature compared to newer projects. With the increasing focus on DeFi and real-world asset tokenization, Chainlink's role becomes even more important. Investing in LINK could be attractive for those looking at long-term growth in the crypto space. Conclusion BTC, ADA, XMR, and LINK are strong options, but XYZVerse ($XYZ) stands out as the first sports memecoin, aiming for 20,000% growth with its unique blend of memes and sports.

2025-06-21T08:52:02,"Bitcoin Price Slides to $103K as Major Altcoins Crash (Weekend Watch)","The broader cryptocurrency market continues struggling amid mounting geopolitical and economic pressures. Bitcoin’s price has lost almost 3% on the day, while major altcoins such as Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and others chart even more considerable declines. Bitcoin Price Tumbles toward $103K Bitcoin is charting a near 3% loss in the past 24 hours in what seems to be a broader crypto market selloff. As seen in the chart below, the price tumbled from around $106,000 to an intraday low at $102,400 before bouncing and settling at where it current trades at the time of this writing. Source: TradingView As CryptoPotato reported, however, the common theme amongst the majority of cryptocurrency analysts and experts is that Bitcoin’s price trading at around $100,000 is indicative of institutional dominance and not retail FOMO. This suggests that it has much more staying power because institutions are a lot less likely to sell during temporary and sudden drawdowns like the current one. At the same time, however, the war between Israel and Iran continues , driving oil prices up and causing turmoil on stock markets as well. Altcoins Crash Harder than BTC The heatmap below paints a clear picture: most of the altcoins are trading in the red and are charting consiedrable losses. Namely, some of the larger-cap cryptocurrencies such as ETH, SOL, ADA, DOGE, HYPE, BCH, LINK, AVAX, and more, are declining for more than 3% during the past 24 hours. Interestingly enough, Bitcoin’s dominance – the metric, which tracks its share relative to that of the rest of the market is up by more than 1% during the same period. This shows that BTC is performing a lot better and altcoins are completely unable to capitalize on its drawdown. In fact, this seems to be the other theme of the current cycle.

HBAR Price. $ 0.14632256 -1.59% Market Cap. $ 6,180,659,233.0664 Trading Volume. $ 110,709,437.4819 Circulating Supply. 42,239,959,710.7310 All-time high. $0.5701 (September 16th, 2021). All-time low. $0.01001 (January 2nd, 2020). Hedera Price Projection 2025 Since peaking at $0.40 in mid-January 2025, the HBAR price has been on a steady decline. External factors dragged it into a falling wedge pattern, reaching a low of $0.125 in early April. However, from the second week of April, a broader crypto rally lifted HBAR as well. It broke out of the wedge, rebounding from a strong support zone, the same area that fueled the Q4 2024 rally. This zone, confirmed by the FRVP indicator, showed high buying interest and supported a sharp rebound. HBAR surged nearly 80%, climbing from $0.125 to $0.228 in April to mid-May. But the momentum didn’t hold. Over the last 40 days, HBAR dropped around 35%, with 21% of that loss occurring in just 10 days. Currently, HBAR is forming another falling wedge with its price trading near its lower boundary, and inching to retest the high-demand zone again. If bulls regain strength, at this zone, then in June or July, HBAR could retest the $0.19 resistance area. A breakout above this resistance area could follow, potentially reaching $0.27 in the upcoming Q3. Looking further ahead, a daily close above $0.27 could open the path to $0.40. If momentum continues, HBAR might even touch $0.75 by year-end. On the downside, failure to hold support may push the price down toward $0.072. Meanwhile, internal developments tell a different story. Hedera’s ecosystem continues to grow. In 2025, it launched its first native hardware wallet, Citadel , and an AI-based tool, the Hedera Agent Kit , making token creation more accessible. Another major project, HashSphere, is due in Q3 2025. It aims to offer a private, regulated blockchain for stablecoin-based payments and asset management. To streamline operations, Hedera also rebranded key entities on May 15. The HBAR Foundation is now the “Hedera Foundation,” and the Governing Council is the “Hedera Council.” In short, while external pressures weigh on price, Hedera’s internal progress remains strong. If macro conditions improve, 2025 could still bring a major turnaround.

2025-06-21T08:23:19,"Cardano’s Treasury Strategy Targets Bitcoin DeFi Boom","The post Cardano’s Treasury Strategy Targets Bitcoin DeFi Boom appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Cardano is making strategic moves to strengthen its DeFi ecosystem, backed by solid fundamentals and community support. With its treasury holding around 1.7 billion ADA, founder Charles Hoskinson has laid out plans to convert a portion into stablecoins to fuel liquidity and long-term growth. However this new proposal has ignited discussion in the Cardano ecosystem , suggesting a strategic deployment of the blockchain’s billion-dollar treasury to bring in both Bitcoin and stablecoin liquidity. Andrew Throuvalas, a researcher and Bitcoin advocate, believes Cardano is uniquely positioned to lead the next phase of Bitcoin DeFi, and the moment to act is now. CARDANO TREASURY DEBATE: BITCOIN AND STABLECOINS Here's my perspective as a Bitcoiner who a) has a majority BTC position, and b) wants to put it into DeFi. Cardano community should ABSOLUTELY deploy treasury funds toward intelligent efforts to bring both BTC and… pic.twitter.com/hWWaVtydew — Andrew | BitcoinOS (@AThrouvalas) June 20, 2025 Meanwhile, Cardano adoption is rising fast, with 110 million transactions and 22 billion ADA staked across 3,000 pools, showing strong community and growing DeFi activity. Built for Bitcoin DeFi but Missing Liquidity Cardano’s architecture shares key similarities with Bitcoin, and its DeFi infrastructure has proven secure and reliable over time. Projects like BitcoinOS and Charms are laying the foundation for bridgeless Bitcoin integration on Cardano, which could support what Throuvalas describes as a $2 trillion DeFi opportunity for Bitcoin. Loopholes? However, two major gaps remain. Cardano currently lacks deep stablecoin liquidity, making it difficult for institutions or large holders to operate at scale without experiencing slippage. In addition, competing ecosystems such as Arbitrum are rapidly building towards similar goals, while Cardano’s unique advantages remain underappreciated by the broader crypto market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Crash Coming! Altcoins to Drop 50–80%, Bitcoin to Face 45% Crash , Stablecoin Pools and BTC Incentives Proposed To close this gap, Throuvalas proposes allocating treasury funds to leading Cardano protocols such as Minswap, Liqwid Finance, and Indigo Protocol. By building large stablecoin pools, these platforms could offer Bitcoin holders the ability to borrow against their BTC more effectively, a critical use case for Bitcoin DeFi participants. He further suggests converting a portion of the ADA treasury into Bitcoin and using it to pay out yield directly in BTC. This would reward users who bring their Bitcoin to the Cardano network. As a precedent, Babylon has already attracted more than $4.5 billion in BTC with similar mechanisms, even though yields are paid in tokens rather than Bitcoin itself. A Timely Opportunity for Cardano Throuvalas believes this approach could significantly boost activity on Cardano and establish it as a long-term hub for Bitcoin DeFi. With its secure infrastructure and untapped treasury, the network could capture lasting value and demand for ADA if it moves quickly to attract Bitcoin liquidity. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

While the intent is to boost liquidity, converting a large ADA amount could create short-term selling pressure. However, proponents argue the market is deep enough to absorb it without significant price impact. What are the potential risks of converting ADA into stablecoins and Bitcoin now? Risks include potential short-term price volatility for ADA due to sales, and the stablecoin market itself carries inherent volatility and regulatory risks. It could also signal a lack of confidence in ADA’s long-term value to some. Could this move attract institutional investors, and if so, what additional infrastructure or compliance measures would be needed? Yes, increased stablecoin and Bitcoin liquidity could attract institutions. This would require robust institutional-grade compliance, security, and potentially tailored financial products like tokenized real-world assets.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/cardanos-treasury-strategy-targets-bitcoin-defi-boom/,"ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION","News|Altcoins",cryptocompare
2025-06-21T08:23:03,"Exploring the Next Wave of Potential Crypto Millionaires by December 2025","As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, certain digital tokens stand out for their potential to generate significant financial returns by December 2025. This article explores a range of coins, including meme tokens and established cryptocurrencies, that are poised for potential growth. Introduction to $XYZ: The Meme Coin Making Waves The crypto community has been buzzing about $XYZ, a meme coin that made an impressive debut by raising $14 million in its early stages. The meme coin, known for its rapid value increase from $0.0001 to $0.003333 during the presale, is now preparing for further growth. Its next target price is $0.005 in the upcoming presale stage. Once the presale concludes, $XYZ is slated for listing on both centralized and decentralized exchanges, promising more exposure and potentially higher value. The community around $XYZ is characterized by its dynamic and engaging nature, promising substantial rewards and incentives. These aspects are crucial for those looking to invest in the potential next big meme coin. Bitcoin: The Stalwart of Digital Currency Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, continues to be a robust choice for investors. It operates on a decentralized network, free from the confines of traditional financial institutions. Bitcoin's innovative technology and its scheduled ""halvings"" contribute to its appeal by potentially increasing its scarcity and value over time. Cardano (ADA): Pioneering Eco-Friendly Blockchain Solutions Cardano stands out in the crypto market with its proof-of-stake mechanism, which not only enhances transaction efficiency but also reduces environmental impact. ADA, Cardano's native token, is crucial for both network security through staking and as a means for transaction and smart contract facilitation. Monero: Championing Privacy Monero offers enhanced privacy, allowing users to conduct transactions without traces. This focus on security and anonymity is increasingly important in a digital age where privacy concerns are escalating. Chainlink: The Link Between Blockchains and Real-World Data Chainlink facilitates the integration of external data into blockchain networks, a critical feature for the functionality of smart contracts. This capability makes LINK an essential part of the growing decentralized finance sector.

Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Bitcoin: Pioneering a New Era of Digital Currency Bitcoin, often dubbed the world's first cryptocurrency, has revolutionized the way we think about money. Introduced by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, it offers a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that operates without a central authority. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin isn't printed or minted; it's a digital asset maintained by a distributed network of computers called nodes. Transactions are verified by miners through a process of solving complex puzzles, ensuring the integrity and security of the network. This innovative system removes the need for intermediaries like banks, making transactions faster and potentially more secure. As we navigate the current market cycle, Bitcoin's potential continues to spark interest. The network undergoes a ""halving"" approximately every four years, reducing the reward for miners by half. This process, designed to cap the total supply at 21 million bitcoins, can influence the network's stability and mining profitability. Compared to newer cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin remains the most established and widely recognized. Its limited supply and increasing adoption suggest a resilient future, though the market remains volatile. Whether Bitcoin is an attractive option now depends on individual perspectives, but its pioneering technology and growing role in the financial world are hard to ignore. ADA Coin: Cardano's Green Revolution in the Crypto World Cardano is shaking up the cryptocurrency scene. It's a platform built for smart contracts, making it easy to create apps, tokens, and games without middlemen. Its coin, ADA, competes with Ethereum's ETH. With ADA, users can store value, make payments, and help secure the network by staking. What makes Cardano special is its eco-friendly approach. It uses proof-of-stake, which is much more energy-efficient than the methods used by many other cryptocurrencies. In today's market, ADA shows great promise. Cardano's technology allows fast transactions, potentially handling up to a million per second. This speed comes from its unique two-layer system, separating transactions from smart contracts. Since 2021, Cardano's native tokens have made interactions with smart contracts safer and cheaper. As the crypto world moves towards sustainability and efficiency, ADA stands out. It's an attractive option for those interested in the future of cryptocurrency. Monero: Your Money, Your Business Monero (XMR) was launched in 2014 with a clear goal: to let people make private transactions. While many think Bitcoin hides their identity, it's actually easy to trace payments back because blockchains are open for all to see. Monero changes this by using advanced cryptography to hide both the sender and the receiver. The team behind Monero puts privacy and security first. They want everyone to have protection, no matter how tech-savvy they are. Monero aims to let payments happen quickly and cheaply, without fear of censorship. In a world where digital footprints are everywhere, Monero offers a way to keep your financial dealings to yourself. This makes it stand out from other cryptocurrencies that are less private. With growing concerns about data privacy, Monero's technology has big potential. In the current market, where regulations are tightening, a coin like Monero could become more attractive. It provides a level of anonymity that others don't. As more people seek privacy, Monero might see increased interest compared to more transparent coins. Chainlink: Bridging Blockchains with the Real World Chainlink is changing how smart contracts work. It connects them to real-world data, like prices and events. This makes them more useful and powerful. Chainlink uses a network of oracles to fetch and verify data. These oracles have a reputation score to ensure the data is accurate. The system combines on-chain and off-chain processes. On-chain, it manages data requests. Off-chain, it gathers the data. The LINK token powers this ecosystem. It rewards those who provide data and keeps the network secure through staking. In the current market, Chainlink stands out. Its ability to connect blockchains with external data fills a crucial gap. As more decentralized apps emerge, the need for reliable data grows. Unlike some coins that offer limited utility, LINK has a clear purpose. Its technology is mature compared to newer projects. With the increasing focus on DeFi and real-world asset tokenization, Chainlink's role becomes even more important. Investing in LINK could be attractive for those looking at long-term growth in the crypto space. Conclusion While BTC, ADA, XMR, and LINK are strong choices this quarter, XYZVerse ($XYZ) stands out as a pioneering sports memecoin aiming for remarkable growth.

2025-06-21T08:17:05,"Expert Makes Bullish $100 XRP Price Scenario","The Modern Investor, a popular voice in the cryptocurrency space, has argued that XRP’s price, hovering around $2.16, is a clear indication that the crypto market is still in its early stages. He made this statement in a recent video , where he compared XRP’s present value to Bitcoin’s current price of just over $104,000, emphasizing that both assets are still far below where many believe they are ultimately headed. According to him, the absence of a $100 XRP or a multi-million-dollar Bitcoin reinforces the idea that digital assets have significant ground left to cover. This view is not based on short-term trends but on long-term expectations shaped by earlier forecasts and multi-cycle price growth projections. Long-Term Growth Is Achievable Rather than dismiss the idea of XRP reaching $100 , The Modern Investor acknowledged its potential, even if the timeline remains uncertain. He referred to past predictions that estimated such growth might occur over several market cycles. While those forecasts were speculative, he argued they were not implausible. He noted that many retail participants often misunderstand the value of long-term strategy in crypto. Price appreciation does not usually occur overnight, but those who invest early and remain consistent have historically been rewarded. His message was intended to refocus investor attention on patience and steady accumulation. Cost Barriers for XRP Accumulation Rising Quickly A major point in his discussion centered on the growing difficulty of acquiring large quantities of XRP. He cited an often-mentioned target of holding 10,000 XRP, a benchmark introduced by analyst Edoardo Farina. Currently, this amount would require an investment of over $21,000. Both The Modern Investor and Farina agree that while this target was once accessible, it has become increasingly out of reach for most people. The original intention may have been to encourage early participation, but the numbers today no longer reflect a typical investor’s capacity. According to Farina, acquiring such a position may soon become impossible for nearly all retail participants. The Door Has Not Closed for Determined Buyers Despite rising costs, The Modern Investor believes the market still offers opportunity. He mentioned that many of his viewers began accumulating digital assets in small amounts several years ago and are now well-positioned, even if they never reached the 10,000 XRP mark. He also pointed to recent data showing that holding just over 11,000 XRP puts investors in the top 4% globally, showing how even modest portfolios can lead to significant standing in the ecosystem through regular market growth and passive income strategies like staking .

2025-06-21T08:16:10,"U.S. Policy Is Moving Slow—But Crypto Traders Aren’t Waiting!","The post U.S. Policy Is Moving Slow—But Crypto Traders Aren’t Waiting! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News While crypto investors often look to Washington for clues about the next big market move, it seems that public emotions and crowd behavior might be playing an even bigger role. With U.S. interest rates on hold, spending bills, and stablecoin rules, the crypto market often moves faster than the news itself. But the bigger question remains—are traders reacting to real changes or reacting to what they expect will happen? Fed Says ‘No Cut Yet’ When the Federal Reserve recently held rates steady at 4.25%–4.50% , nobody was surprised. But many crypto investors had secretly hoped for hints of future rate cuts. That didn’t happen. Fed Chair Jerome Powell played it safe, saying they’ll wait and watch inflation. This lack of clarity left crypto investors uncertain. Bitcoin, which had climbed as high as $112,000 the previous week, dropped 8% and hovered around $104,000. This shows that the market had likely “priced in” the Fed’s decision ahead of time. Interestingly, altcoins like Solana, XRP, and Cardano, which usually react more sharply to market news, remained relatively stable. According to Santiment’s on-chain data , traders appear to be following a pattern of “sell the rumor, buy the news,” reflecting indecision in a market waiting for a clearer direction. GENIUS Act Brings Hope and Worry to Stablecoin Another major update is the GENIUS Act, a bill passed by the U.S. Senate. It’s designed to bring clear rules to stablecoins like USDC and USDT. The bill says these tokens must be backed by real dollars and overseen by trusted financial regulators. If it becomes law, it’ll force companies like Circle and Coinbase to follow strict rules and hold real-dollar reserves. So far, social sentiment is bullish. But traders had already bought the rumor. If the House delays the bill, or nothing major follows, we could see prices cool off. Bitcoin and the ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ The U.S. government’s massive spending plan, dubbed the “Big Beautiful Bill,” has reignited Bitcoin’s inflation hedge story. With fears of more money printing, many are turning to BTC as a way to protect their savings. Our latest insight takes a look at the ongoing saga between Powell & Trump, the GENIUS Act, and the Big Beautiful Bill. These American fiscal decisions can have enormous impact on crypto's future. We explore. https://t.co/w3gvYollBL pic.twitter.com/CJQpp0N38j — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 21, 2025 There’s also fresh interest in privacy coins like Monero and DeFi platforms like MakerDAO.

2025-06-21T08:08:27,"Connecticut teen admits role in $245 million Bitcoin heist","A Connecticut man has pleaded guilty to participating in a theft of $245 million in Bitcoin. According to reports, the suspect, Veer Chetal, pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering conspiracy charges after his parents were kidnapped. According to court documents that were unsealed this week, 19-year-old Chetal from Danbury, Connecticut, has also agreed to testify against his co-defendants. The Connecticut native was one of three men charged in an online scam last August, stealing about 4,100 Bitcoins from their victim, a resident in Washington D.C. Reports claimed that the trio used the proceeds from the heist to live a luxury lifestyle, spending millions on cars, jewelry, rental mansions and nightclub parties. Connecticut native docked for Bitcoin theft after parents’ kidnap According to authorities, a week after Chetal and his co-conspirators carried out the crime, his parents were kidnapped and assaulted. Although the attack failed, authorities believed that the attacker had aimed to use the kidnap to coerce Chetal, who they believed had a large amount of digital assets, into using part of the funds to secure his parents’ release. Chetal’s parents were said to be in their new Lamborghini SUV when the attackers forced them out and assaulted them. Police, at the time, mentioned that after they were taken, the attackers bound them and forced them into their waiting van. Witnesses immediately called the police. The police were able to react quickly, arresting four men after they abandoned their vehicles and the van to flee on foot. Two other suspects were later arrested at a nearby home the group rented through an Airbnb, authorities said. During the hearing, one of the defendants, Michael Rivas, apologized for his actions. He said it was a dumb idea and he only did it to help one of the co-defendants who had a vendetta, although he did not elaborate. Meanwhile, his lawyer said that he only accepted to be a part of the gang in hopes of getting a share of the loot. At the time, there were reports of a Bitcoin theft where the assailants had been reportedly involved in a massive spending spree. Chetal agrees to testify against his co-defendants The criminal case involving the Connecticut native was unsealed on Monday in a Washington federal court, revealing his guilty plea in November and an agreement to cooperate with federal authorities investigating the Bitcoin theft. It also revealed the prosecutors are looking into new allegations that he was involved in about 50 other thefts where he stole more than $3 million from November 2023 to September 2024. Authorities also claimed that Chetal was also involved in a $2 million crypto theft that took place in October, but refused to tell them about it. Last September, federal agents with a search warrant raided the Connecticut native’s Brunswick, New Jersey apartment and his parent’s home in Danbury in connection to the Bitcoin theft. Investigators mentioned that they found more than $500,000 in cash, expensive jewelry and watches, and luxury clothes. Federal agents also added that Chetal had about $39 million worth of digital assets that he turned over to investigators. Authorities claimed that Chetal could face deportation as part of the criminal case. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Historically, Bitcoin dips again before rallying, possibly pulling XRP’s price lower. XRP’s RSI trendline recently broke, hinting at a big move ahead. The cryptocurrency market has been pretty dull lately, with both Bitcoin and XRP trading sideways. Prices aren’t going up or down in a big way, and traders are waiting for a breakout. However, this calm period is called an accumulation phase, where the price stays in a tight range before making a strong move. Crypto experts now have compared XRP’s current price movement to Bitcoin’s past market cycles. Similar patterns happened with Bitcoin in 2020 and even with the stock market. In both cases, prices hit a high, dropped about 50%, stayed flat for a while, and then broke out to much higher levels. Historically, Bitcoin often dips one more time before starting a new rally. If that happens again, XRP’s price could also drop, depending on how long Bitcoin takes to make its move.

Altcoins Could Drop 50–70%, Memecoins To Face 80% Wipeout He identifies two key support levels for Bitcoin: first at $93,000 and then the main support zone between $60K and $ 70 K. This would be a 35-45% decline from the current prices. In a full-blown capitulation or a Black Swan scenario, the analyst says Ethereum could drop 45-55% and reach the $1000-$1200 range. Altcoins are expected to drop 50-70% on average, while memecoins could be hit the hardest. They could crash by up to 60-80%, as per the analyst. He expects the real drop to begin once Bitcoin breaks the $100,000 level. That is when bearish momentum could accelerate sharply. He also shared a few examples of coins that are already collapsing before Bitcoin’s drawdown. Charts Point to Memecoin Meltdown Crypto Capo’s charts show memecoins are on the edge of major breakdowns. FARTCOIN is at risk of dropping 61% to the first support zone around $0.38, and possibly 82% drop to $0.17 if it falls further. RETARDIO is stuck below resistance and showing weakness. Despite several bounces, it’s stuck in a lower range, showing signs of exhaustion. PEPE has triggered a bearish Head and Shoulders pattern, with an expected 70% drop ahead. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP Prices are Down Today? , Slow Bleed Continues CryptoQuant data also shows that altcoins are still deep in a slump.

He also expects coins like POPCAT to continue drifting lower, with no major liquidations or panic selling so far. Most altcoins look weak, and the analyst sees no strong buy signals at the moment.

2025-06-21T07:50:55,"Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong: Why the World Desperately Needs Crypto Now","BitcoinWorld Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong: Why the World Desperately Needs Crypto Now In a recent and impactful statement, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong took to social media to share a powerful message resonating with many in the digital asset space: the World needs crypto , perhaps now more than at any point in recent history. This isn’t just a bold claim from a figurehead in the industry; it’s a perspective rooted in observing significant global economic trends that he believes cryptocurrency is uniquely positioned to address. Why Does Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong Believe Crypto is Essential? Brian Armstrong’s assertion stems from several critical global economic challenges. He specifically highlighted three major concerns driving his conviction: Exponentially Growing Debt Levels: Across nations, both public and private debt continues to balloon. This unsustainable growth raises questions about future economic stability and the potential for currency devaluation as governments potentially resort to printing more money to service debt. Widespread Inflation: Many countries are grappling with persistent inflation, eroding purchasing power and making it harder for individuals and families to save and maintain their standard of living. Traditional financial systems often struggle to contain this, leaving citizens vulnerable. Erosion of Economic Freedom: Armstrong argues that economic freedom is being chipped away globally. This can manifest in various ways, from capital controls and censorship of transactions to limited access to financial services for large portions of the world’s population. According to the Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong , these intertwined issues create a pressing need for alternative financial systems that are more resilient, accessible, and permissionless than traditional finance. He sees crypto as that necessary alternative. Exploring the Core Crypto Benefits Armstrong Highlights When we talk about why the World needs crypto , we’re really talking about the fundamental advantages that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology offer in the face of the challenges Armstrong outlined. The crypto benefits that stand out include: Decentralization: Unlike traditional currencies controlled by central banks, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin operate on decentralized networks. This removes single points of control and potential failure, offering a degree of independence from government fiscal policies that can lead to inflation or debt crises. Permissionless Access: Anyone with an internet connection can access and use cryptocurrencies. This is a massive step towards global financial inclusion, particularly for the estimated 1.7 billion adults worldwide who remain unbanked but may have mobile phones. This directly combats the erosion of economic freedom by providing financial tools to everyone. Transparency and Security: Transactions on public blockchains are transparent (though parties can be pseudonymous) and secured by cryptographic principles. This contrasts with opaque traditional financial systems and offers a level of security against censorship or arbitrary seizure. Potential Hedge Against Inflation: While volatile, some cryptocurrencies, particularly those with capped supplies like Bitcoin, are viewed by proponents as a potential store of value and a hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies caused by inflation and excessive money printing. Understanding crypto and inflation dynamics is crucial for many seeking alternatives to traditional savings methods. These inherent features form the bedrock of Armstrong’s argument that crypto is not just a speculative asset class, but a vital tool for navigating the current global economic landscape. How Does Crypto Offer Economic Freedom Crypto? The concept of Economic freedom crypto is central to Brian Armstrong’s vision. What does this truly mean in practice? It means giving individuals greater autonomy over their finances. Consider a few scenarios: An individual in a country experiencing hyperinflation can hold value in a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or a stablecoin, preserving their wealth better than holding the rapidly devaluing local currency. A freelancer working for international clients can receive payments quickly and cheaply using crypto, bypassing slow and expensive traditional cross-border transfer systems that often involve multiple intermediaries and fees. People living under authoritarian regimes or in areas with underdeveloped banking infrastructure can access financial services, store value, and transact without needing permission from a bank or government entity. This ability to transact, save, and invest without intermediaries or geographic limitations is the essence of the Economic freedom crypto promises. It empowers individuals and reduces reliance on potentially unstable or restrictive traditional financial systems. Addressing Crypto and Inflation Concerns One of the most discussed aspects of why the World needs crypto , according to Armstrong, is its role in combating inflation. The relationship between Crypto and inflation is complex, but the core idea is that assets with limited supply, like Bitcoin (capped at 21 million coins), are inherently deflationary or disinflationary by design, contrasting sharply with fiat currencies which can be printed indefinitely by central banks. While the crypto market is known for its volatility, many investors see assets like Bitcoin as a form of ‘digital gold’ – a store of value that holds its purchasing power over the long term, especially as traditional currencies lose value due to inflationary pressures. This perspective is gaining traction as global inflation persists. What Does This Mean for the Average Person? Brian Armstrong’s message isn’t just for economists or crypto enthusiasts. It has implications for everyone. As global debt rises and inflation eats away at savings, understanding alternatives becomes increasingly important. The crypto benefits discussed aren’t just theoretical; they offer practical ways for individuals to protect their wealth, participate in the global economy, and gain a degree of financial independence. Whether it’s exploring cryptocurrencies as a small part of a diversified savings strategy or using crypto for faster, cheaper international remittances, the opportunities presented by this technology are becoming harder to ignore in the current economic climate. Conclusion: Crypto’s Growing Role in a Challenging World Brian Armstrong’s statement serves as a potent reminder of the foundational problems that cryptocurrency was created to address. In a world grappling with mounting debt, persistent inflation, and concerns about economic freedom, the case for why the World needs crypto becomes compelling. The unique features of decentralization, permissionless access, and transparency offer tangible crypto benefits that can empower individuals and provide alternatives to traditional financial systems facing significant stress. As the global economic landscape continues to evolve, the role of Economic freedom crypto enables, and the potential of Crypto and inflation hedging will likely become even more significant, validating the perspective shared by the Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong .

2025-06-21T07:49:20,"Solana Price Analysis: Analysts Say SOL ETF Approval Is “Near-Lock” – What Does This Mean for the $200 Target?","Solana (SOL) is back in the spotlight as Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas now estimate a 90% chance of a Solana spot ETF being approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before year-end. According to their June 21 research note, the question is no longer “if,” but “when.” The momentum behind crypto ETFs has surged since Bitcoin and Ethereum funds made their debut on Wall Street. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust alone gathered over $70 billion in assets under management, faster than any ETF in history. NEW: @EricBalchunas & I are raising our odds for the vast majority of the spot crypto ETF filings to 90% or higher. Engagement from the SEC is a very positive sign in our opinion pic.twitter.com/5dh8G8rK6Y — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 20, 2025 With crypto legitimacy rising in D.C., the SEC has shown a willingness to engage with altcoin ETF filings, including updated S-1 forms from Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, and VanEck. Solana is seen as a frontrunner due to its market depth, developer traction, and now, staking-enabled ETF proposals. If approved, these ETFs wouldn’t just track SOL, they’d also stake held tokens, generating additional yield for investors. What a Solana ETF Could Mean for Price Institutional investors gaining direct access to Solana could dramatically shift market dynamics. According to Brian Rudick, Chief Strategy Officer at Solana-focused Upexi, top-tier altcoin ETFs, such as SOL, are likely to see strong inflows post-launch, similar to Bitcoin’s explosive run after its ETF debut. “Spot ETFs were the main reason Bitcoin more than doubled after BlackRock filed in mid-2023,” Rudick said. A comparable demand shock for Solana could ignite a similar rally. If history repeats itself, ETF-driven inflows could propel SOL toward the $200 mark, especially if market sentiment and macroeconomic tailwinds align. Analysts also point to the CFTC’s futures approval for SOL as another positive signal, which reinforces market maturity and regulatory openness toward the asset. Price Faces Technical Hurdles Before Breakout Despite ETF optimism, Solana’s short-term technicals remain bearish. At $140.40, SOL is struggling below the key resistance zone between $144.49 and $145.49, aligned with a descending trendline and the 50-period EMA. SOL is stuck below key resistance at $144.49–$145.49, with a bearish engulfing candle and MACD in the red. If $138.39 support breaks, eyes on $135.74 and $132.57 next. #Solana #Crypto #SOL #TechnicalAnalysis pic.twitter.com/UTWYK9JnOA — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) June 21, 2025 A bearish engulfing candle followed the last failed breakout attempt, sending the token into a consolidation phase just above support at $138.39. The MACD indicator remains in bearish territory, suggesting continued downside risk unless SOL reclaims the $145 zone. Should support at $138.39 give way, price could drop toward $135.74 or even $132.57. Solana Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Key Takeaways: Bloomberg pegs SOL ETF approval odds at 95% ETF issuers include Grayscale, Fidelity, VanEck Staking-enabled ETFs could boost investor yield SOL must break $145.49 to regain bullish momentum Downside levels to watch: $138.39, $135.74, $132.57 Outlook: ETF approval is a long-term catalyst ; however, for short-term Solana price prediction , traders should watch for a confirmed breakout above $145 to signal a bullish continuation. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.2M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers In addition to Solana, with BTC trading near $104K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,249,360 out of its $8,290,897 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.00257 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 58% APY staking pool holding over 1.81 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income. With just hours left and the hard cap nearly reached, momentum is building fast. BTCBULL ’s blend of Bitcoin-linked value, scarcity mechanics, and flexible staking is fueling strong demand. Early buyers have a limited time to enter before the next pricing tier activates.

2025-06-21T07:36:17,"Elon Musk Is Building a DEX on Twitter—What This Means for Crypto","The post Elon Musk Is Building a DEX on Twitter—What This Means for Crypto appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Elon Musk is making his boldest move yet in finance. The visionary billionaire behind Tesla and SpaceX is now transforming X —formerly Twitter—into a decentralized finance powerhouse. If successful, Musk could deliver the Western version of WeChat, combining social media, investing, payments, and crypto all in one app. X to Launch Its Own Decentralized Exchange (DEX) According to a recent post on X by crypto researcher Atlas , the platform is quietly developing into a full-fledged financial ecosystem. Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, confirmed that in-app investing, tipping, and payments are already in the pipeline. These features will be part of X Money , a new digital finance platform currently in limited beta testing, with a broader rollout expected in 2025. One major highlight? Visa is now an official partner of X’s upcoming DEX. Why Musk’s Super App Vision Could Be a Game-Changer Musk’s ultimate goal is to replicate WeChat’s super app model—but in the West. WeChat dominates in China by combining messaging, payments, e-commerce, and even government services into one platform. By integrating a decentralized exchange, Musk gives users: Full control over their funds Censorship resistance Lower transaction fees Enhanced financial privacy Other tech giants are taking note: Meta is exploring in-app payments TikTok is pushing into e-commerce Telegram has already launched P2P crypto trading and tipping But X’s existing scale and Musk’s crypto-friendly stance could give it a major first-mover advantage. Could X Disrupt Coinbase, Robinhood, and Revolut? Atlas warns that this move could shake up the entire fintech and crypto exchange landscape. With in-app trading of stablecoins , BTC, ETH, and tokenized assets, X could replace the need for separate apps like Coinbase, Robinhood, and Revolut. While centralized exchanges like Binance, Bybit, Coinbase, OKX, and Upbit still handle more than 85% of crypto spot volume, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are rapidly growing. Top DEXs by volume today include: PancakeSwap (v2 & v3) Uniswap v2 Raydium Curve Finance The Future of Finance Will Be Cultural, Not Technical Atlas emphasizes that mass adoption won’t come from whitepapers or technical jargon—it will come from entertainment, virality, and seamless finance integration. With X already a cultural hub, Musk may be the one to trigger the next wave of crypto adoption —not with a whitepaper, but with a viral tweet. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-21T07:27:05,"Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP Prices are Down Today?","The post Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP Prices are Down Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market today is feeling the weight of macroeconomic and geopolitical risks. Successively, the valuation of the industry has dropped to $3.2 trillion, with a 1.10% decline in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the 24-hour trading volume has surged over 42% to hit $114.74 billion, signaling heightened volatility and possibly panic-led sell-offs. Amidst the ruckus, the Fear & Greed Index has moved to 43, placing the market in the neutral zone. Rising tensions in the Middle East and uncertainties around the potential restoration of Trump-era trade policies are spooking both traditional and digital asset investors. Let’s take a closer look at how this is impacting Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction: Can It Hold Above $102k? Bitcoin price today is at $103,491, down 0.94% in the past 24 hours. The daily low sits at $102,372, suggesting that the price is hovering dangerously close to key support levels. The 38% uptick in 24-hour volume to $50.25B indicates aggressive intraday trading, but not necessarily bullish accumulation. If BTC fails to maintain support at $102,000, a further slide toward $100,000 or even $98,500 is highly likely. However, if the market finds temporary relief and BTC reclaims $105,000, a short-term recovery toward $107,000–$108,000 may be on the cards. Curious about BTC’s year-end target? Read our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction: $2,400 or $2,300 First? Ethereum is bearing the brunt of today’s drop, plunging 3.59% to $2,423.62. The altcoin has seen its daily trading volume crash by over 76%, now at $21.59 billion. With a daily low of $2,371, ETH is testing a crucial demand zone. If it breaks below $2,370, the next key support lies around $2,300, followed by $2,200. It is worth noting that to initiate a recovery, ETH must climb back above $2,500. That being said, a push beyond $2,570 could invalidate short-term bearish setups and open a route toward $2,650. Hodling ETH? Check out our Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 Now! XRP Price Prediction: Is a Drop Below $2 Next? XRP price has slipped 1.16% over the past 24 hours to trade at $2.12, with a low of $2.09. Despite the modest drop compared to ETH, the volume has surged 45.9% to $2.49 billion, which I believe, that larger holders are offloading positions. If bearish pressure intensifies, XRP may retest $2.00, a support that could give way to a drop toward $1.90. Contrarily, reclaiming $2.18 could spark a minor relief rally toward $2.30. Curious about XRP’s future returns? Read our Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 Now! FAQs Why is the Bitcoin price falling today? Bitcoin is reacting to macroeconomic uncertainty, including tensions in the Middle East and fears surrounding potential Trump-era policy rollbacks. Will Ethereum fall below $2,300? Given the sharp volume decline and price weakness, Ethereum could test the $2,300–$2,200 range if the bulls don’t step in soon. Is XRP expected to drop below $2? If current bearish momentum continues, XRP could slide below $2, targeting $1.90 as the next major support.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-ethereum-xrp-prices-going-low-today/,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare

It has emerged that the company is considering using the eye-scan-based World ID system developed by Tools for Humanity, co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. This is also a system that is linked to the World (WLD) altcoin. The ongoing talks between Reddit and Tools for Humanity could pave the way for users on the platform to both remain anonymous and prove they are human, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The talks have gained momentum amid the rise of fake content generated by artificial intelligence online and the emergence of age-verification laws for social media in several countries. Related News: Two Companies Announce Bitcoin Purchase Strategy - Here's How Much They Plan to Buy Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said last month that due to AI-based threats and age verification regulations, the company will have to determine whether users are human and of a certain age. Huffman said that they will work with third-party providers to avoid collecting user data: “We will work to preserve both the humanity and anonymity of Reddit.” The World ID is created with unique biometric data obtained from a user’s iris. This data is fragmented and stored on secret servers in different parts of the world. The system allows users to prove that they are a unique individual without revealing their identity. The identity verification process is completed with a World ID stored encrypted on the user’s phone. As a reward, users are given WLD tokens. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-21T07:04:27,"16,000,000,000 Passwords Leaked in Historic Data Breach – Apple, Facebook and Google Users Affected: Report","Cybersecurity researchers have reportedly uncovered what is likely the biggest data breach in history, affecting billions of people who use Apple, Facebook, Google and other services. Since the beginning of the year, researchers at Cybernews have been thumbing through “supermassive datasets” that contain at least 16 billion records of login information for social media, VPNs, developer portals, corporate platforms and much more. The researchers say “no stone was left unturned.” “This is not just a leak – it’s a blueprint for mass exploitation. With over 16 billion login records exposed, cybercriminals now have unprecedented access to personal credentials that can be used for account takeover, identity theft, and highly targeted phishing. What’s especially concerning is the structure and recency of these datasets – these aren’t just old breaches being recycled. This is fresh, weaponizable intelligence at scale.” The experts say that some of the datasets were labeled with vague names like “logins” or “credentials,” not giving much of a hint as to what was inside the files. However, other datasets were more specific with their labeling. According to the researchers, one dataset’s name suggested it was linked to the Russian Federation and had over 455 million records inside. Another was named after Telegram, the encrypted messaging app. “The inclusion of both old and recent infostealer logs – often with tokens, cookies, and metadata – makes this data particularly dangerous for organizations lacking multi-factor authentication or credential hygiene practices,” Bob Diachenko, a cybersecurity researcher and a contributor to Cybernews, is responsible for the discovery. Diachenko clarified that there was “no centralized data breach” of the aforementioned tech companies. Rather, the information was likely extracted using infostealers and then leaked onto the dark web. Researcher Aras Nazarovas said that the discovery might be evidence that cybercriminals have abandoned their old techniques of stealing data, and moving onto more sophisticated methods. “The increased number of exposed infostealer datasets in the form of centralized, traditional databases, like the ones found by the Cybernews research team, may be a sign, that cybercriminals are actively shifting from previously popular alternatives such as Telegram groups, which were previously the go-to place for obtaining data collected by infostealer malware.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-21T06:40:24,"Governor Abbott signed House Bill 4488 to protect Bitcoin reserves.","Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed House Bill 4488, ensuring that state funds — including any Bitcoin Reserve held outside the state treasury — are shielded from being redirected into general revenue. This paves the way for Texas to formalize a strategic Bitcoin investment program . Still , Governor Abbott has yet to weigh in on SB21, a bill permitting state investment in cryptocurrencies with at least a market capitalization of $500 billion. So far, only Bitcoin meets the criteria. Texas Governor Abbott has yet to approve or reject the SB21 bill The House Bill 4488 protects the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, the Texas Advanced Nuclear Development Fund, and the Gulf Coast Protection Account. That means the funds will remain established or maintained as distinct entities within or outside the state treasury, as defined by their enabling laws. However, creating the state’s Bitcoin Reserve hinges on signing SB21 or a comparable bill. If the legislation is signed, then the fund would fall under the legal protections outlined in HB4488. SB21 was submitted to the governor on June 1, giving him until June 22 to sign or veto it. If he takes no action by then, the bill will automatically become law. New Hampshire and Arizona approved their Bitcoin Reserve bills New Hampshire , Arizona, and Texas are among the first states to approve state-level Bitcoin Reserves. Although several other states introduced similar bills in recent months, most failed to advance due to lawmakers’ reluctance over concerns of Bitcoin’s volatility and long-term viability as a reserve asset. Arizona’s Senate also recently passed HB 2324 in a 16-14 vote, a bill that could see the expansion of the state’s crypto infrastructure. The bill is now back in the House for a final decision. If passed, the bill would amend Arizona’s forfeiture laws to permit the state to treat abandoned digital assets as unclaimed property. Arizona’s House also passed Senate Bill 1025 (SB1025), which stipulated that seized funds could be invested in Bitcoin. However, Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed it. She wrote: The Arizona State Retirement System is one of the strongest in the nation because it makes sound and informed investments. Arizonans’ retirement funds are not the place for the state to try untested investments like virtual currencу. Governor Katie Hobbs Michigan also introduced four new pro-crypto bills. The first would permit the state’s retirement fund to hold Bitcoin, while the second bill targets CBDCs, calling for a statewide ban and enhanced financial privacy protections. The other two bills are centered on BTC mining, including benefits for those operating on abandoned oil and gas wells. New Hampshire passed HB 302 into law, allowing the state treasurer to purchase Bitcoin and other digital assets with a market cap above $500 billion. The state also maintains a 5% cap on Bitcoin and digital assets to ensure crypto remains complementary.

2025-06-21T06:30:34,"Consolidation Takes Its Toll: Bitcoin Investors No Longer Greedy","Data shows the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has returned back to the neutral territory, a sign that investors are losing optimism. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Has Reset Back To Neutral The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment present among the traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: Dogecoin Gears Up For 60% Move—Will It Be Up Or Down? The index makes use of the data of these five factors in order to determine the trader mentality: trading volume, market cap dominance, volatility, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. The indicator represents the calculated sentiment as a score lying between zero and hundred. Values above the 54 mark correspond to the dominance of greed in the market, while those below 46 to presence of fear among the investors. All values lying between these cutoffs correlate to a net neutral sentiment. Now, here is how the mood in the Bitcoin market is like right now according to the Fear & Greed Index: As is visible above, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has a value of 54 at the moment, which suggests the investors hold a neutral sentiment, although one that’s right on the edge of turning into greed. The recent neutral mentality in the sector has come following a phase of greed among the traders, as the below chart shows. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index spiked to a high of 72 earlier in the month as the asset’s price gave investors hope that its consolidation phase might be coming to an end. As the recovery rally has fizzled out and the coin has returned to its range, however, optimism among the investors has predictably faded. If history is to go by, though, this development may not actually be so bad for the cryptocurrency. Generally, digital asset markets tend to move in a way that goes contrary to the expectations of the majority. The probability of such an opposite move taking place goes up the more extreme the crowd opinion becomes. Besides the three core sentiments, there are two special regions known as the extreme fear (under 25) and extreme greed (above 75). These zones are where the likelihood of a contrary move has been the strongest in the past, with tops and bottoms often taking form. Although the market sentiment has recently only seen a reset to the neutral territory, the fact that the investors are no longer greedy could still be a positive for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. There have been many instances in the past where a dip into the neutral zone was enough for the bull run to regain momentum.

2025-06-21T06:30:15,"Solana and BTC Investors Are Placing Big Bets on MAGACOIN FINANCE","As June 2025 unfolds, investors from the Solana (SOL) and Bitcoin (BTC) communities are making bold moves by placing significant bets on MAGACOIN FINANCE. While XRP, Ethereum (ETH), TRON (TRX), and Sei (SEI) remain in the spotlight for their own developments, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as the top speculative play, drawing attention for its explosive upside potential and strategic positioning in the current market cycle. Powerhouse Performance: MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Early Investment Surge MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly establishing itself as a leading force in the altcoin pre-sale space, gaining momentum through exclusivity and growing investor enthusiasm. Its transparent token distribution, capped supply, and upcoming staking functionality are central to its long-term appeal. Backed by strong analyst sentiment, the project is positioned for compelling performance following its public launch. Project Highlights: Transparent and capped tokenomics Strategic bonuses supporting both community and institutional engagement, including a 100% bonus for larger contributors using PATRIOTS100X . Solana (SOL): Bullish Outlook and Institutional Interest Solana is trading near $149, with bullish analysts forecasting a surge to $380–$500 by year-end, driven by institutional adoption and DeFi/NFT growth. Despite past network outages, high transaction speeds and low fees keep SOL at the forefront. As Solana’s ecosystem expands, some investors are rotating profits into MAGACOIN FINANCE, seeking sharper early-stage returns. Bitcoin (BTC): Market Anchor and Sentiment Driver Bitcoin remains structurally sound, though recent price hesitancy and macroeconomic concerns have led to cautious sentiment. Still, BTC’s leadership continues to set the tone for the broader market. As BTC consolidates, many traders are diversifying into high-upside plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Awaiting Major Catalysts XRP is trading near $2.20–$2.31, with investors closely watching the June 16 Ripple lawsuit decision and ETF speculation. While whale accumulation signals long-term confidence, many are also hedging with MAGACOIN FINANCE for higher-multiple potential as regulatory clarity remains elusive. Ethereum (ETH): Bullish Momentum Builds ETH is trading around $2,690, up 8% daily, as the Pectra upgrade and institutional inflows fuel optimism. With resistance near $2,700–$2,900, some ETH holders are diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture early-stage momentum before the next leg up. TRON (TRX): Bullish Trend and Price Targets TRON is holding above $0.28, with June forecasts targeting $0.31 and a bullish outlook for 2025. As TRX maintains its uptrend, some traders are allocating to MAGACOIN FINANCE for its high-upside potential. Sei (SEI): Growth Forecasts for 2025 SEI is expected to show solid growth, with forecasts suggesting a rise to around €0.77 ($0.83) by December 2025. As SEI’s ecosystem expands, MAGACOIN FINANCE is also benefiting from renewed interest in innovative altcoins. Final Thoughts With Solana and Bitcoin investors leading the charge, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the breakout story of June 2025. As XRP, ETH, TRX, and SEI hold steady, the boldest upside may belong to those moving early on MAGACOIN FINANCE.

2025-06-21T06:00:14,"Why Bitcoin Whales Are Quietly Buying Into MAGACOIN FINANCE","While the broader crypto market digests June’s volatility, a new trend is emerging beneath the surface. Large Bitcoin holders — often known for their early positioning — are quietly rotating capital into MAGACOIN FINANCE. At the same time, more visible assets like Chainlink, Polkadot, Polygon, and Cardano are grappling with resistance levels and investor hesitation. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Quiet Moves, Clear Intent As legacy tokens fight to maintain momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction where it matters — among smart money. Bitcoin whales are steadily buying in, not for flash, but for fundamentals. With a hard supply cap of 170 billion tokens, staking already operational, and a fully audited smart contract via HashEx, this project offers a rare alignment of security, utility, and upside potential.This is the type of asset Bitcoin whales accumulate early — before it makes headlines. Why top investors are entering now: Capped Supply: No risk of inflation or stealth minting Staking Rewards: Passive income model already running Verified Code: Full audit completed for trust assurance Decentralized Control: No VC manipulation, all community-led On-Chain Patterns: Low churn, growing wallet concentration Bonus Active: PATRIOTS100X giving early entrants added leverage Chainlink (LINK) Eyes Continuation Above $16 Chainlink recently bounced back, surging to $15.30 and currently trading near $15.80–$16.50. The move came after strong integration news involving SWIFT and JPMorgan, pushing bullish forecasts toward $20–$25 if momentum sustains. Still, with LINK approaching key resistance, some short-term traders are locking in gains and reallocating to smaller-cap assets with higher near-term upside. Polkadot (DOT) Rises on Elastic Scaling Buzz Polkadot is testing the $4.40–$4.80 range following a 16% weekly gain, driven by anticipation around its June 2025 Elastic Scaling rollout. If DOT breaks above $5.00, analysts believe it could reach $8–$10 by year-end. For now, the token is showing strength but hasn’t fully confirmed a longer-term breakout, leading cautious capital to diversify elsewhere. Polygon (MATIC) Rebounds During PoS Transition Polygon is currently trading between $0.21 and $0.28 amid major structural changes, including the transition from MATIC to POL. With Polygon 2.0 and AggLayer v3.0 aiming for massive TPS boosts and better cross-chain liquidity, long-term interest remains strong. However, the short-term price has yet to reflect those changes, keeping speculative capital on standby. Cardano (ADA) Drifts Amid Governance Uncertainty Cardano is hovering around $0.63 following a 26% year-to-date decline. The treasury debate over reallocating 140 million ADA has caused unease within the community. While the Chang hard fork and Hydra upgrade offer long-term promise, ADA’s price action is subdued, and many traders are looking toward more active growth opportunities. Final Thoughts With Chainlink, Polkadot, Polygon, and Cardano navigating technical hurdles, the quiet accumulation of MAGACOIN FINANCE by large holders may signal where the next breakout truly begins.
