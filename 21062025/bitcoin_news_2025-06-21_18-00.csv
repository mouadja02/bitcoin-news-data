2025-06-21T15:30:13,"Bitcoin Price Breakdown Spurs Sell-Offs, Analyst Reveals What Will Happen If BTC Hits 92,800","The Bitcoin price crashed from as high as $106,000 to $102,000 on June 20, sparking sell-offs among investors. Now, crypto analyst Colin has indicated that the flagship crypto could still drop to as low as $92,800 and revealed what will happen if BTC gets there. The Current Bitcoin Price Action And What To Expect In an X post, Colin said that it looks increasingly likely that the Bitcoin price will see a retest of at least 100,800 as the first major level of support. The analyst made this statement as BTC dropped out of a bullish pennant for a second time. The measured target for this bull pennant is $150,000. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Could Rise 3x To $300,000 As AVIV Levels Resemble Previous Bull Cycles However, with the most recent breakdown, the Bitcoin price threatens to decline further before any potential move to the upside. Colin stated that the next major levels below $100,800 are $97,600 and $92,800. He opined that BTC is likely to quickly rebound from these support levels if it gets there. The crypto analyst remarked that this Bitcoin price movement is all possible within the confines of the right shoulder of the larger inverse Head-and-Shoulders pattern. He added that this can make the right shoulder more complete, basically on the same level as the left shoulder. This analysis comes just a day after Colin revealed that BTC has deviated from the global M2 money supply. However, he suggested that the BTC bull market is far from over. The analyst noted that the deviation happens 20% of the time and doesn’t invalidate the macro trend. Basically, the Bitcoin price is primed to rally higher at some point and possibly reach the $150,000 measured target. Market expert Raoul Pal also commented on BTC’s correlation with the money supply, stating that it shows that there is no need to worry about the current price action. Bulls Need To Step In For BTC In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto stated that the Bulls need to step in now for the Bitcoin price. He noted that BTC is facing a key test, having just been rejected at the Fair Value Gap at around $106,000. The analyst added that the flagship crypto is now retesting the lower boundary of the symmetrical triangle. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Price Could Rise 3x To $300,000 As AVIV Levels Resemble Previous Bull Cycles Titan of Crypto stated that if this lower boundary at around $104,000 fails, then the next level would be the previous weekly low at $102,679. If the Bitcoin price fails to hold that level, it could further drop to the liquidity pocket near $100,300. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $103,500, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

2025-06-21T15:28:22,"Companies Are Racing to Build Bitcoin Treasuries","Several non-crypto companies are emulating MicroStrategy by buying and storing bitcoin, driving a dramatic 170% rise in corporate-held BTC. Altogether, around 130 public companies now own roughly 3.2% of bitcoin’s total supply. • MicroStrategy (now “Strategy”): Founder Michael Saylor set the trend in August 2020 when his firm started selling shares to buy bitcoin. Their market cap soared beyond the value of their holdings. Now with 592,100 BTC, they continue issuing equity and debt—$42 billion planned over three years—to accumulate more, confident they can weather even a 90% drop. • Twenty One Capital: This new firm emerged in May via a SPAC merger, backed by Tether and SoftBank. With about 37,230 BTC (worth nearly $3.9 billion), it aims to rival Strategy as the leading listed bitcoin accumulation vehicle. • Tesla: Elon Musk’s company first bought $1.5 billion in bitcoin in 2021, briefly sold most of it in 2022, and has since restocked. Tesla recorded a $600 million accounting gain last year thanks to crypto valuation rules. • Metaplanet: Originally a hotel developer, this Tokyo firm pivoted in 2024 to follow Strategy’s model. With 10,000 BTC now, it plans to reach 210,000 by 2027. Eric Trump even advises the company. • Block (formerly Square): Under Jack Dorsey, Block began buying BTC in October 2020. Now the company invests 10% of monthly gross profits from its bitcoin services back into holdings, aiming to solidify bitcoin’s role as the “internet’s native currency.” • Next Technology Holding: The Chinese AI software company jumped from 833 BTC late last year to 5,833 BTC in Q1 2025 after issuing shares and warrants to fund their crypto acquisition strategy. Nasdaq even warned about delisting before the move. • GameStop: The memestock-stock icon entered the bitcoin space in late May, purchasing 4,710 BTC via a $512 million convertible bond offering. Despite initial share-price drops, it's already preparing a second $2.25 billion bond issue. • Semler Scientific: This US healthcare-tech firm replaced its cash reserves with bitcoin starting in May 2024. With 4,449 BTC bought via cash, equity issuance, and $100 million in bonds, Semler’s share price hasn’t soared—but it's holding steady at a valuation close to its bitcoin assets. • Trump Media & Technology Group: Though currently holding no bitcoin, Trump’s media firm aims to build a treasury portfolio worth $2.5 billion. No purchases are scheduled yet, but a pro-crypto regulatory push is expected under his influence. Across the board, many of these firms are valued at a premium over their bitcoin holdings , reflecting investor confidence that they can continually issue new shares or bonds to fund purchases—a cycle dubbed the “infinite money glitch.” However, this strategy is untested in a sustained crypto downturn , and heavy debt could leave some companies vulnerable if bitcoin prices collapse.",coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/companies-are-racing-to-build-bitcoin-treasuries,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","",cryptocompare
2025-06-21T15:21:44,"Peter Schiff Claims He “Gets Bitcoin” But Not Dollar-Pegged Stablecoins, Plans To Launch Gold-Backed Alternative","Peter Schiff — a prominent gold advocate and Bitcoin critic — has slammed U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, as the assets enjoy a moment in U.S. policy circles after the Senate passed a landmark regulation bill with major bipartisan support. Schiff called the US dollar a “flawed fiat currency,” emphasizing the need for a gold-backed stablecoin instead. “I get Bitcoin, but not U.S. dollar stablecoins,” Schiff opined in a Friday post on X. “If you’re going to introduce a third-party custodian, why settle for a token backed by a flawed fiat currency like the dollar, when you can own one backed by gold? You get the same liquidity, but you also get a real store of value.” A stablecoin is a crypto token whose price is pegged to a stable currency, mostly the U.S. dollar. This is normally done by holding a reserve of dollars and other assets that cover the cost of the issued stablecoins. Crypto traders use stablecoins to enter and exit positions without having to access fiat currencies directly, particularly in markets where U.S. dollars are prohibited or unreachable. These assets can also be used to make payments or send remittances abroad in real-time and at much lower costs compared to traditional rails. When one X user urged Schiff to introduce a gold-backed stablecoin, Schiff noted that such a coin already exists and added that he plans to launch his own. The stablecoin market is currently dominated by U.S. dollar-backed tokens like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. Stablecoins Are Poised To Explode Schiff’s comments come as the U.S. Senate passed the GENIUS Act to regulate the fast-growing stablecoin industry. The legislation now heads to the House, and President Donald Trump expects to sign it into law by August. As previously covered by ZyCrypto , retail giants Amazon and Walmart, and other multinational companies are considering launching their own stablecoins. The stablecoin market has grown to over $260 billion, with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent predicting that it could become a $3.7 trillion asset class by the end of the decade, especially with the passage of the GENIUS Act.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/peter-schiff-claims-he-gets-bitcoin-but-not-dollar-pegged-stablecoins-plans-to-launch-gold-backed-alternative/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Peter Schiff|Stablecoins",cryptocompare

Investors are worried about the US getting involved in the conflict after President Trump warned Iran about not signing a deal. The flagship cryptocurrency plunged from an intraday high of $106,513 on Friday as markets turned bearish. It fell to a low of $102,446 before settling at $103,388, ultimately registering a drop of 1.19%. BTC is down nearly 2% over the past 24 hours, trading around $103,495. Semler Scientific Discloses Ambitious Bitcoin Strategy Healthcare technology firm Semler Scientific has announced an ambitious Bitcoin accumulation plan to expand its Bitcoin holdings aggressively. The company also announced the appointment of Joe Burnett as the Director of Bitcoin Strategy. Semler Scientific plans to increase its Bitcoin holdings to 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025, 42,000 BTC by the end of 2026, and 105,000 by the end of 2027. It plans to use proceeds from equity and debt financing and cash flows from operations to fund the purchases. “Semler Scientific also announced that it plans to hold 10,000 bitcoins by year-end 2025, 42,000 by year-end 2026, and 105,000 by year-end 2027, using proceeds from equity and debt financings and cash flows from operations.” Burnett stated that Semler Scientific is committed to expanding its Bitcoin reserves in a way that could benefit shareholders who believe Bitcoin is the ultimate long-term asset. Semler Scientific was optimistic about Burnett’s appointment as its Director of Bitcoin Strategy, stating, “We are excited to have Joe join our Bitcoin strategy team and help drive our three-year plan to own 105,000 bitcoins. Joe is an analytical thought leader on Bitcoin and Bitcoin treasury companies. His expertise will be instrumental as we pursue our bitcoin treasury strategy and aim to deliver long-term value to our stockholders.” Worries About A Post-Trump Bitcoin Eric Semler, the chairman of healthcare firm Semler Scientific Inc., has revealed that many hedge fund executives are skeptical and worried about Bitcoin’s prospects once President Trump leaves office. Semler stated in an interview with Natalie Brunell, “I think that they think it is a fly-by-night concept and that it is probably going to, after the Trump administration, go back down a lot.” Semler, also the founder of TCS Capital Management, made the comments amid growing skepticism within the crypto industry about how long the support for crypto will last once President Trump exits office. Some prominent figures, like Jan3 founder Samson Mow, are concerned that support for crypto could vanish under a future president. However, Semler has doubled down on Bitcoin , with Semler Scientific becoming the second publicly traded company in the US to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy. The company has announced an aggressive Bitcoin acquisition plan to take its holdings to 105,000 BTC . “When you’re making a bet on something that the majority doesn’t believe in, and you’re right, you make so much more money. I think we got great opportunities to show people that basically they’re missing out on a great opportunity.” Hedge Funds Turning To Bitcoin A survey by the Alternative Investment Management Association and PwC in October 2024 revealed that 47% of hedge fund managers are exposed to crypto. This is up from 29% in 2023. Meanwhile, 37% of the respondents said they had no exposure to crypto in 2022. In 2021, Intertrust surveyed chief financial officers from 100 hedge funds about plans to purchase crypto assets, including Bitcoin. 98% of them responded that they expect hedge funds to invest at least 7% of their assets in crypto by 2026. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) registered an alarming slump on Friday as market sentiment worsened thanks to escalating geopolitical tensions. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency dropped from an intraday high of $106,513 to $102,446 before reclaiming $103,000 and settling at $103,388. Markets have been under tremendous pressure thanks to macroeconomic factors and geopolitical uncertainty. This led to the crypto market falling nearly 1.50% on June 21, wiping out $240 billion in value. One of the biggest triggers for BTC and the crypto market’s decline is the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Investors and market watchers are worried about the US getting involved in the conflict after President Trump adopted a hardline stance and issued a veiled threat to Iran’s supreme leader. Trump has also warned Iran over not signing a deal when it had the opportunity. Bitcoin whales are also selling their holdings as they lock their profits, putting more pressure on the price. According to data from Glassnode, wallets that held BTC for 6-12 months sold over $900 million of the asset in recent weeks as they began cashing out. Long-term Bitcoin holders took home $1.2 billion in profits in early June. Liquidations have also put pressure on the price, as many traders using leverage were wiped out thanks to BTC’s recent price action. Over the past 24 hours, over $500 million in crypto positions were liquidated, affecting over 134,000 traders. BTC started the previous week in positive territory, surging over 4% to cross the 20-day SMA and $110,000 to settle at $110,247. The price fell to an intraday low of $108,325 on Tuesday before recovering to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,258. BTC lost momentum on Wednesday, falling 1.43% to $108,686. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price plunged nearly 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,826. BTC fell to an intraday low of $102,854 on Friday as selling pressure persisted. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase, reclaim $106,000, and settle at $106,106. Source: TradingView Sellers regained control on Saturday as BTC fell 0.59% to $105,482 before registering a marginal increase on Sunday and settling at $105,561. BTC started the week on a bullish note, surging to an intraday high of $108,939 before settling at $106,808, ultimately registering an increase of $106,808. Price action turned negative on Tuesday as BTC fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $105,000 to $104,519. The flagship cryptocurrency faced volatility on Wednesday but registered a marginal increase and moved to $104,884. It was back in the red on Thursday, dropping 0.24% to $104,631. BTC raced to an intraday high of $106,513 but lost momentum after reaching this level, eventually falling below the 20-day SMA and settling at $103,388. The current session sees the price marginally up, trading around $103,781. Buyers will look to maintain control and push BTC beyond $105,000.

2025-06-21T14:40:27,"Ethereum spot ETF Flows See Crucial Shift as Outflows Hit $11.3M","BitcoinWorld Ethereum spot ETF Flows See Crucial Shift as Outflows Hit $11.3M The nascent U.S. Ethereum spot ETF market experienced a notable shift on June 20, recording its first day of net outflows after a promising four-day streak of positive inflows. This development has caught the attention of investors closely watching the impact of these new investment vehicles on the broader crypto market . Understanding Recent ETH ETF Flows After kicking off trading with significant interest, the various U.S. ETH ETF products saw cumulative inflows exceeding $100 million in the days leading up to June 20. However, the latest data indicates a reversal in this trend, with a net outflow of $11.3 million recorded on Thursday. Breaking down the numbers provides a clearer picture of which funds saw movement: BlackRock’s ETHA: This fund, which had previously seen strong inflows, experienced the largest single outflow on June 20, totaling $19.7 million. Grayscale’s ETH: In contrast to BlackRock, Grayscale’s fund recorded a net inflow of $6.6 million. Grayscale’s product typically sees different flow dynamics due to its conversion from a trust structure. Other Funds: Several other issuers also saw minor inflows or outflows, contributing to the overall net figure. Here’s a quick look at the key movements on June 20: ETF Ticker Issuer Net Flow (June 20) ETHA BlackRock -$19.7M ETH Grayscale +$6.6M (Aggregated Others) Various +$1.8M Total Net Flow -$11.3M What Does This Shift in ETF Flows Mean? While an $11.3 million outflow might seem small compared to the billions seen in Bitcoin ETFs, it’s a significant event for the newly launched Ethereum spot ETF market. This outflow ends the initial positive momentum and could signal a period of volatility or caution among investors. Several factors could contribute to this shift: Profit Taking: Some investors might be taking profits after the initial excitement and price movements following the ETF launches. Market Uncertainty: Broader economic concerns or shifts in the overall crypto market sentiment can influence investment decisions in specific assets like Ethereum. Rebalancing: Institutional investors might be rebalancing their portfolios, leading to temporary outflows from certain positions. Initial Volatility: New ETF products often experience choppy ETF flows in their early trading days as market participants find equilibrium. Analyzing the Impact on Ethereum Price The relationship between ETF flows and asset prices is complex. While large inflows are generally seen as bullish indicators, and outflows as bearish, the impact on Ethereum price isn’t always immediate or direct. Ethereum’s price is influenced by a multitude of factors, including network activity, regulatory news, and overall market sentiment. This initial outflow, while a change in trend, is relatively small in the context of Ethereum’s overall market capitalization and daily trading volume. Therefore, predicting a major price drop based solely on this single day’s data would be speculative. However, sustained outflows over a longer period could put downward pressure on the price, just as sustained inflows could drive it up. Key Takeaways and Actionable Insights Monitor Flows Closely: While one day doesn’t make a trend, watching subsequent days’ ETH ETF flow data will be crucial to understand if this is a temporary blip or the start of a new pattern. Context is Key: Compare Ethereum ETF flows to Bitcoin ETF flows and the broader crypto market performance to gain perspective. Long-Term View: The introduction of the Ethereum spot ETF is a long-term development aimed at providing traditional investors easier access to ETH. Short-term flow volatility is expected. Diversify Information Sources: Don’t rely solely on ETF flow data. Keep track of other fundamental and technical indicators for Ethereum. The end of the four-day inflow streak for U.S. Ethereum spot ETF s with an $11.3 million net outflow on June 20 marks a moment of pause in the initial enthusiasm. While the amount is modest, the reversal in trend highlights the dynamic nature of ETF flows in nascent markets. Investors should continue to monitor these flows alongside other market indicators to gauge the potential impact on the Ethereum price and the overall health of the crypto market . This is just the beginning for Ethereum ETFs, and their journey will likely involve periods of both inflows and outflows as the market matures.

A court has issued the preliminary approval of a deal that awards a total of $2.3 million to the more than 71,000 victims impacted by a cybersecurity attack at Sysco, a major food distribution company. The funds are for “all individuals who reside in the United States to whom Sysco sent notice of the cybersecurity event in or around May 2023.” The data breach compromised personal information, including names, Social Security numbers, account numbers and other personal information that Sysco had for payroll purposes, such as phone numbers, addresses and email addresses. Under the terms of the deal, the victims are entitled to up to $5,000 in documented losses due to the data breach, including costs to combat identity theft or as a result of identity theft, as well as an additional payment estimated to be between $100 and $200 but up to $599. The lawsuit, filed by Sysco truck driver Joseph Trottier, accuses the company of failing “to take and implement adequate and reasonable measures to ensure that the PII (personally identifiable information) of Plaintiff and Class Members was safeguarded, failing to take available steps to prevent an unauthorized disclosure of data, and failing to follow applicable, required and appropriate protocols, policies and procedures regarding the encryption of data, even for internal use.” The lawsuit says the stolen personal info “can be sold on the Dark Web.” “Hackers can access and then offer for sale the unencrypted, un-redacted PII to criminals. Plaintiff and Class Members now face a lifetime risk of (i) identity theft, which is heightened here by the loss of Social Security numbers, and (ii) the sharing and detrimental use of their sensitive information.” In a notice sent to the victims, Sysco had said that it learned in March 2023 that a “threat actor gained access to our systems without authorization and claimed to have acquired certain data.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-21T14:30:57,"Bitcoin Enters Institutional Era: Just 216 Holders Control 30% Of Supply","Bitcoin saw a sharp retracement to $102,300 after briefly climbing to $106,500 earlier today, as bulls failed once again to break through critical resistance. Sellers are stepping in at key supply zones, pushing back against attempts to enter price discovery above the $112K all-time high. Despite this pressure, Bitcoin remains resilient above the psychologically significant $100K mark, where it has found support since early June. The latest on-chain data from Gemini and Glassnode reveals a noteworthy structural shift: over 30% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply is now held by just 216 centralized entities. These include exchanges, ETFs, funds, public and private companies, DeFi contracts, and even governments. Exchanges currently hold the largest share, while public companies represent the most numerous holders. This trend highlights the deepening custodial centralization of Bitcoin, raising both adoption optimism and decentralization concerns. As the macroeconomic backdrop remains volatile—with high US Treasury yields, the Fed holding interest rates, and geopolitical tensions intensifying— Bitcoin’s price action is becoming increasingly sensitive to shifts in sentiment and liquidity. Whether BTC can hold this key support or slide deeper into correction will depend on upcoming volume reactions and potential moves from these dominant custodial players. Centralization And Geopolitics Shape Bitcoin’s Next Move Bitcoin is currently down 8% from its $112K all-time high, hovering in a broad consolidation phase with no decisive breakout. The price action suggests that the market is at a critical juncture, with traders split between two possibilities: a deeper retracement toward the $94K level or a renewed push into price discovery. This indecision is amplified by ongoing geopolitical tensions, particularly the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Many analysts warn that if the United States steps in, it could trigger panic across global markets, creating spillover effects into the crypto space. Meanwhile, key insights from Glassnode and Gemini shed light on a growing trend in Bitcoin’s ownership structure. Over 30% of the circulating supply is now held by just 216 centralized entities. This reflects a dual narrative—on one hand, increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin as a reserve or investment asset, and on the other, rising custodial centralization that may undermine the network’s decentralized ethos. The largest holdings belong to crypto exchanges, ETFs, and funds, followed by public and private companies that have allocated BTC to their balance sheets. A notable portion is also locked in DeFi contracts, with some controlled by governments following seizures or strategic acquisitions. While this growing centralization may boost credibility and capital inflow, it also introduces new risks to liquidity and distribution. In such a fragile macro environment, Bitcoin’s next major move will depend not only on technical setups but also on the behavior of these key holders under pressure. BTC Price Analysis: Bulls Lose Momentum Bitcoin has retraced from its recent local high of $106,500 and is now trading around the $103,100 mark, testing a key support level highlighted in yellow on the chart—specifically the $103,600 zone. This level served as resistance earlier in the year and is now acting as a critical demand area during this consolidation phase. A daily or 3-day close below this threshold could signal further downside and open the door for a retest of the $100,000 psychological support. The chart shows lower highs forming since the $112,000 all-time high, which, if continued, may form a descending triangle structure—typically a bearish continuation pattern. Price rejection around $109,300 confirms that sellers remain in control at higher levels. Volume is slightly elevated on red candles, suggesting increased distribution. The 50 and 100 moving averages (at approximately $94,700 and $87,500, respectively) remain well below the current price, indicating room for further retracement if bearish momentum builds. Still, the broader uptrend remains intact unless price decisively breaks below the $100,000 level. Bulls need to reclaim $106,500 and close above $109,300 to signal strength. Until then, Bitcoin appears locked in a tightening range, with downside risk increasing in the short term.

2025-06-21T14:30:09,"US Banks Sued After Artificial Intelligence Sparks $20,000 Fraudulent Transfer: Report","Two billion-dollar banks are facing a lawsuit for allegedly failing to stop a huge transfer fueled by artificial intelligence. Texas resident Gary Cunningham is suing PlainsCapital Bank and Pathward N.A. after $20,000 was fraudulently transferred from his account, reports Fox 26. The fraud happened after criminals hacked Cunningham’s email and used AI to clone his voice and convince his accountant to transfer $20,000 to a Pathward Financial account instead of the usual Chase account. At the time, his accountant was being deceived, Cunningham was traveling. The 76-year-old, who is representing himself in court, says the institutions should have better protections against AI-initiated fraud. I believe I have enough information here to force the banks to do something different because they were negligent – grossly negligent. “[The accountant] was convinced it was me talking to her – but I didn’t – I was on a plane to Chicago. There’s no way that was me.” While Cunningham is not a trained lawyer, he tells Fox 26 he learned the court process from his late wife and was also guided by a couple of friends who are lawyers. The lawsuit comes at a time when financial fraud against elderly Americans is on the rise. Annually, elderly Americans are losing over $3 billion per year to fraud, according to the FBI.

2025-06-21T14:25:34,"Bitcoin Whales Withdraw from Binance, New Best Presale Contender Attracts Huge Investor Surge","Bitcoin Whales Trigger Crypto Market Shift The recent swings in the Bitcoin market have sent waves of caution through crypto communities. Big withdrawals from centralized platforms like Binance are showing that whales—big Bitcoin holders—might be repositioning or reducing their Bitcoin exposure amid apparent regulatory uncertainty and security issues. As these influential players make big moves, more and more retail investors are also making a shift, looking to find and fund decentralized and transparent opportunities that they see as safer. Within this context, the Neo Pepe Presale is now over $1.3 million funded, doing quite well in what is currently a not-so-bullish presale crypto market. They are in stage four of their presale, with some of the tokens selling for $0.08, on their way, we presume, to some steep token price increases after the presale is over. How Bitcoin Whale Movements Impact Market Moves Bitcoin whale movements are more usual indicators than instigators, frequently shining a light on larger shifts in the market’s feel. Recent outflows from Binance, however, are simply raising too many eyebrows and seem to be prompting a lot of second-guessing and rethinking. Investors who are not in full-blown panic mode are at least nudged closer to that realm when they consider 1. the total amounts being withdrawn; 2. the percentage of Binance’s total in/out flow that these withdrawals and the associated market making and money moving back and forth seem to indicate; and 3. the apparent internal/external governance problems at Binance and its affiliated companies that these withdrawals call into question. As speculative investigation begins to cause investor panic, one of the only ways out is seemingly through Neo Pepe Coin and the governance problems it solves. These features mark it as one of the surefire best crypto presale contenders of the year. Transparent Presale Structure Builds Investor Confidence Neo Pepe has emerged as a top pepe coin thanks to its robust presale strategy. That strategy is fully transparent and verifiable through on-chain activity. How is the presale so transparent? Because, unlike opaque projects that have a presale, Neo Pepe operates under a model called decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). And that presale, ladies and gentlemen, has a multisig approach to overseeing what goes where and with whom concerning your tokens and treasury. Now, young whales and old codgers might ask: ""Why care about transparency during the presale? Centralized projects are centralized for a reason. Do I have to eliminate de facto centralization to achieve this level of transparency?"" In the face of market manipulation from massive movement of whales, there’s your answer. You might want to pick up a little Neo Pepe as its early-stage pricing gives you considerable incentives for seeking presale opportunities. $NEOP’s Unique Positioning in Crypto’s Future Investor demand for transparency in cryptocurrency markets changed from something that some might characterize as a luxury to an overall requirement in 2025. Neo Pepe meets this demand through what could best be described as a trustless, open-source operation. Much of the trust that investors might have in a presale is built on the mechanisms that are employed to release the tokens in a manner that doesn't put too much downward pressure on the market. Neo Pepe's presale ostensibly employs such mechanisms. Yet, there's much more to Neo Pepe than just operating in a trustless fashion that makes the presale investor-friendly. There are also the automatic trust assurances that come with the kind of open-source operation that provides mechanism transparency. How Neo Pepe is Enhancing Decentralized Finance Participating in decentralized finance (DeFi) is not enough for Neo Pepe—it is actively enriching this part of the crypto universe through innovations in governance and financial security. Neo Pepe sharply reduces several familiar risks associated with traditional crypto investments. By decentralizing treasury control and establishing clear, auditable processes, it reduces the kind of uncertainty that can lead to catastrophic losses. Its smart contract outlines the process for managing treasury funds far too well for anyone to mistake it for the kind of secretive operation that led to the collapse of FTX. This active participation model is particularly appealing in an era where investors seek more meaningful control and less exposure to centralized financial pitfalls. Neo Pepe's Big Moment—Youtuber Asks Is This Coin Really Crypto’s Future? Crypto analyst Gems Booster examines this upcoming top pepe coin presale, with a sharp eye and sharper commentary, the presale of Neo Pepe. They unpack what sets this ambitious meme coin apart and what might hold it back. Their conclusion is that the presale is indeed carefully crafted and innovative, with layered strategy that escalates excitement through clearly defined pricing stages. Yet, even as they laud the sophistication (and, more importantly, the practicality) of Neo Pepe's auto-liquidity protocol, they remain lightly skeptical. After all, as Gems Booster points out, a truly innovative project with bold ideas is not always a sure bet in the current crypto market. They offer a set of potential obstacles that could stand in Neo Pepe's way and provide some vivid, honest commentary. You won't find more straightforward coverage around. 3 Key Reasons to Participate in Neo Pepe Coin’s Presale Full On-Chain Transparency – Every action is visible on the blockchain, ensuring accountability and fostering trust among early investors. Immutable Governance – No centralized control or hidden privileges, with all critical decisions executed by community consensus through the DAO. Staged Incentives – Early participation offers the best pricing opportunities, incentivizing swift action and rewarding early conviction. Why Retail Investors Prefer Neo Pepe Retail investors are gravitating toward Neo Pepe’s for several strategic reasons: Transparency and Trust: Retail investors prioritize visibility into the inner workings of their investments. Neo Pepe’s DAO structure and fully transparent tokenomics meet these requirements comprehensively. Community Control: Decisions are made collectively, reducing the risk of centralized manipulation or hidden agendas, empowering investors directly. Deflationary Mechanics: The automatic liquidity and burning of LP tokens ensure sustained value appreciation, a key aspect that appeals to both short-term speculators and long-term holders. Clear Roadmap: Neo Pepe’s clearly defined and ambitious roadmap includes robust milestones, each strategically planned to ensure incremental and sustainable growth.

2025-06-21T14:07:36,"Russia ramps up search for ‘black miners’ implicated in 1.3 trillion-ruble loss","Russian grid operator Rosseti has set out to hunt down what it calls “black miners,” or those mining cryptocurrencies on stolen electricity worth billions of rubles. The power company, one of the largest in the world, announced it’s now working with Russian telecoms to expand its toolkit for identifying illegal crypto mining farms across the vast country. Rosseti to catch illegal crypto miners by analyzing internet traffic State-controlled Rosseti, the energy giant uniting regional grid operators in Russia, is elaborating a new mechanism to pinpoint illegal mining facilities, its head told journalists on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum ( SPIEF ). Andrei Ryumin, who chairs Rosseti’s management board and serves as its director general, revealed that the company is currently working with Russian mobile operators Rostelecom and Mobile TeleSystems (MTS) on the matter, the business news portal RBC reported. The group hopes they can identify mining farms by following internet traffic. Ryumin explained: “For example, if data is transferred in large volumes, then this is mining. We are currently interacting with them so that they can locate such facilities and help us understand if they are legal.” The technology to do that is there, the official added. Meanwhile, MTS confirmed it has already provided Rosseti with access to its EnergyTool, an AI-based solution that analyzes not only internet traffic but also a number of other indicators, such as data from smart electricity meters. “Areas with abnormal traffic are indicated on the map, which helps energy workers find illegal cryptocurrency mining more effectively,” said Oleg Aldoshin, vice president of corporate business at MTS, the largest telecommunications firm and mobile network operator in Russia. According to its stats, the number of mining farms in the Russian Federation has increased by 9% in the first five months of 2025. Mining, as an industry, has been growing since its legalization in the country last year. To mine legally, companies and individual entrepreneurs are required to register with the Federal Tax Service (FNS) and pay their taxes . However, according to the authority, less than a third of active miners have so far done so. ‘Black miners’ caused $16.5 million in damages in 2024 According to Rosseti’s calculations, the so-called “black miners,” who tap into electricity networks illegally to mint digital coins, caused financial damages of more than 1.3 billion rubles ($16.5 million) last year alone. In reality, the losses are much higher than the estimate, Andrei Ryumin is convinced. He also noted: “We identify only part of the black mining.” The differential tariff for electricity distributed to the population, which was introduced in early 2025, is only good for combating “gray miners,” the executive also remarked. In Russia’s terminology, small miners who mine at their homes are often called “gray” as they are not required to register as mining enterprises with the FNS if their consumption does not exceed 6,000 kWh of electricity monthly. Differential rates allow Russian utilities to keep their consumption in check as they are charged more than regular households for the larger amounts of electricity powering improvised mining rigs in basements and garages. At the same time, “black” miners are those who burn energy completely outside the law by illegally connecting their hardware to public grids. “And the more expensive bitcoin is, the more of them there are,” the head of Rosseti pointed out. The power giant is also keeping track of the geographical distribution of illegal mining activities. According to the company’s estimates, Dagestan, along with other Russian republics in the North Caucasus, has the largest concentration of black miners, followed by some parts of Siberia . So far, mining has been banned in almost a dozen energy-deficient regions of the country, but critics say the restrictive measures mostly affect legal mining businesses.

2025-06-21T14:00:25,"Ethereum Charts Signal Potential Bottom – All Eyes On Next Move","Ethereum is once again trading at critical demand levels, testing the lower boundary of a six-week range that began forming in early May. After briefly climbing toward $2,800 earlier this month, ETH has retraced back to the $2,400 zone, reigniting debate about whether this is a healthy consolidation or a sign of further downside to come. Despite the pressure, Ethereum has not broken below this range, signaling that buyers continue to step in at these levels. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Sees $123 And $116 As Mid-Zone Support Levels – Here’s Why This extended consolidation period suggests a decisive move is nearing. Breakouts from tight ranges like this one often lead to strong directional momentum, and ETH’s current price structure could act as a launchpad—if bulls regain control. According to top analyst M-log1, Ethereum may have already bottomed during its most recent retrace, with the current action reflecting accumulation rather than weakness. The ETH/BTC ratio, another critical chart watched by traders, is also hovering near support levels, implying that a rotation back into altcoins may be imminent if Ethereum holds or pushes higher. For now, the market watches closely, as ETH’s next move could set the tone for broader altcoin performance in the weeks ahead. Ethereum Holds Range As Market Awaits Decisive Break Ethereum continues to trade within a tight consolidation range that began in early May, showing resilience despite growing global tensions and macroeconomic uncertainty. The price has hovered between $2,360 and $2,700, forming a narrow channel as buyers and sellers remain locked in a standoff. With conflicts in the Middle East intensifying and financial markets reacting to high interest rates and rising Treasury yields, crypto assets are under pressure, and Ethereum is no exception. The long-anticipated altseason has yet to materialize, and Ethereum is widely seen as the key to unlocking that next phase. ETH’s dominance in the smart contract and DeFi space gives it a central role in leading altcoin market momentum. Traders and analysts are closely monitoring its current range, especially after M-log1 shared analysis suggesting the recent low at $2,360 could mark a local bottom. According to M-log1, Ethereum is now consolidating just below the $2,450 level, and this zone could serve as a bullish trigger if reclaimed with strength. A decisive move in either direction will likely set the tone for the broader crypto market, with a breakout above $2,500 potentially igniting the next leg upward. Until then, market participants are watching closely. If ETH fails to hold these demand levels, the range could break to the downside, delaying any altseason rally further. But if bulls regain control and push above key resistance, it could signal the start of a much-anticipated upward move. In this environment of uncertainty, Ethereum’s next breakout-or breakdown—could prove pivotal for market sentiment heading into the second half of the year. Related Reading: Ethereum Prepares For A Decisive Move: ETH/BTC Setup Could Trigger Altseason ETH Tests Key Support As Price Retraces Ethereum is currently trading at $2,405, down 4.17% in the last session, after testing a low of $2,367. The chart reveals that ETH has retraced back to the lower boundary of a six-week range, confirming strong demand in the $2,360–$2,400 area. This zone has acted as a critical support level multiple times, with bulls stepping in each time to defend it. The price remains trapped below the 200-day moving average ($2,774), which has proven to be a strong resistance. Meanwhile, both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages are trending below price, currently sitting at $2,287 and $2,640, respectively, tightening the range even more. This compression typically leads to high volatility once a breakout occurs. Related Reading: Ethereum Mirrors Bitcoin 2017-2021 Pattern – $4,000 Is The Trigger Point Volume has remained elevated during recent sessions, suggesting that buyers and sellers are actively competing for control. A decisive close below $2,360 could trigger a cascade toward $2,100 or lower. Conversely, if bulls manage to reclaim $2,500 and sustain momentum toward the $2,700–$2,800 resistance band, it may set the stage for a breakout.

2025-06-21T13:50:51,"Raoul Pal Unveils Astonishing Crypto Bull Run Prediction Extending to 2026","BitcoinWorld Raoul Pal Unveils Astonishing Crypto Bull Run Prediction Extending to 2026 Are we currently witnessing a repeat of history in the cryptocurrency markets? According to one prominent voice in the financial world, the answer is a resounding yes, with potentially significant implications for the duration of the current crypto bull run . This analysis suggests that the exciting upward trajectory we’ve seen might just be getting started, potentially pushing the peak much further out than many initially anticipated. Is This Crypto Market Cycle Different? Raoul Pal Weighs In Raoul Pal, the CEO of Real Vision and a respected figure known for his macroeconomics expertise applied to crypto, recently shared his insights in a video. His core message? The current crypto market cycle bears a “spookily similar” resemblance to the now-legendary 2017 bull run. This comparison isn’t made lightly; 2017 was a period of explosive growth that captured global attention and brought Bitcoin and altcoins into the mainstream consciousness. Pal’s observation isn’t just based on price action, though chart patterns can offer clues. His analysis delves deeper, incorporating macroeconomic factors that he believes are influencing the market’s behavior and potentially extending its timeline. Understanding these underlying forces is crucial for anyone trying to navigate the complexities of digital asset markets. Why Raoul Pal Predicts a Longer Crypto Prediction Timeline One of the key reasons behind Raoul Pal’s extended crypto prediction is his proprietary business cycle score. This metric, which assesses the health and phase of the global economy, currently sits below 50. According to Pal, when this score is low, it typically takes a considerable amount of time for it to rise significantly. This slow ascent of the business cycle score suggests that the broader economic environment remains conducive to risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies for a longer period than in typical cycles. Think of it like this: traditional market cycles often follow predictable patterns tied to economic expansion and contraction. However, if the economic engine is running slower than usual (as indicated by a low business cycle score), the associated market phases, including the crypto bull market, might also unfold over a more extended timeframe. This is a critical piece of Pal’s thesis, moving beyond simple chart analysis to ground his prediction in fundamental economic conditions. The Weakening Dollar and Its Impact on the Crypto Bull Run Another significant factor cited by Raoul Pal is the weakening U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar’s strength or weakness often has an inverse relationship with risk assets, including commodities, emerging markets, and cryptocurrencies. When the dollar weakens, it can make dollar-denominated assets relatively less attractive and push investors towards alternatives that are perceived to hold value or offer growth potential. Here’s a simplified look at why a weakening dollar can fuel the crypto bull run : Increased Liquidity: A weaker dollar often coincides with looser monetary policy or a shift away from dollar hoarding, potentially freeing up capital to flow into other markets. Inflation Hedge Narrative: While debated, many view Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as potential hedges against the devaluation of fiat currencies like the dollar. A weakening dollar can strengthen this narrative. Global Investor Behavior: For international investors holding other currencies, a weaker dollar makes buying dollar-denominated assets (like many major cryptocurrencies traded against USD pairs) relatively cheaper. Pal believes this ongoing trend of dollar weakness is a powerful tailwind that could provide sustained momentum for the crypto market, contributing significantly to the potential extension of the current cycle. Looking Ahead: Why 2026 Crypto Predictions Are Gaining Traction Combining the slow grind of the business cycle and the supportive environment created by a weakening dollar leads Raoul Pal to his specific timeline: an extension of the bull market into the second quarter (Q2) of 2026 crypto . This is a notable prediction, as many previous analyses based on historical Bitcoin halving cycles might have anticipated a peak sometime in late 2024 or 2025. Pal’s analysis suggests that focusing solely on the halving event might be too narrow a view in the current unique macroeconomic climate. The confluence of a low business cycle score and dollar weakness provides a different lens, suggesting that the typical post-halving rally could have a longer fuse this time around. This doesn’t invalidate the halving’s importance but posits that external macro factors are playing an unusually dominant role in shaping the duration of this particular crypto market cycle . Actionable Insights Based on This Extended Forecast: Longer-Term Perspective: If Pal is correct, investors might have more time to accumulate or hold positions, shifting focus away from trying to time a near-term peak. Risk Management Remains Key: While the potential upside period is extended, market volatility is inherent in crypto. Don’t mistake an extended cycle prediction for a guarantee of continuous upward movement without pullbacks. Diversification: An extended bull run could see various altcoins perform strongly. Researching projects beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum might be beneficial, but always understand the risks. Stay Informed on Macro: Pal’s analysis highlights the importance of macroeconomics. Keeping an eye on indicators like the U.S. dollar index and global economic health can provide valuable context. It’s important to remember that this is one analyst’s perspective, albeit a highly respected one. The crypto market is influenced by a multitude of factors, and predictions are never guaranteed. However, Pal’s framework offers a compelling argument for why this cycle might not follow the exact pattern of its predecessors. Conclusion: Navigating the Potential Extended Crypto Bull Run Raoul Pal’s analysis, drawing parallels to 2017 and incorporating macroeconomic signals like a low business cycle score and a weakening dollar, presents a compelling case for an extended crypto bull run potentially reaching into Q2 2026 crypto . While historical cycles offer valuable insights, the current global economic landscape appears to be introducing new variables that could stretch the timeline significantly. This outlook suggests that the opportunities within the crypto market cycle might not be expiring as quickly as some models predict. However, it also underscores the importance of understanding the macro forces at play and approaching the market with a long-term perspective and robust risk management strategy. Whether this prediction plays out precisely remains to be seen, but it certainly provides a thought-provoking framework for considering the potential duration and dynamics of the current market phase.

2025-06-21T13:46:28,"Bitcoin is ‘supporting the dollar rather than acting as a hedge’ – Binance report","Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) ability to serve as a hedge against the U.S. dollar is becoming less certain, with data indicating the crypto ‘s movement is aligning with the currency. Specifically, Bitcoin’s correlation with the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has surged to 0.25, the highest among major macro assets, marking an increase from May’s 0.15, according to a June 20 report by Binance Research shared with Finbold. Bitcoin correlation with other assets chart. Source: Binance Research Historically, the maiden digital currency has moved opposite to the dollar or remained unaffected. “This rare shift suggests that BTC may currently be reacting to the same liquidity conditions supporting the dollar rather than acting as a hedge against it,” the report noted. Bitcoin’s correlation with macro assets The report also revealed a 0.33 correlation between Bitcoin and 10-year Treasury yields, indicating the cryptocurrency’s potential as an inflation hedge. On the other hand, BTC’s relation with the S&P 500 has dropped to 0.21, signaling a move away from its earlier equity-like trading pattern. Furthermore, Bitcoin’s link to gold remains mildly negative at -0.11. While the precious metal tends to respond to traditional risk sentiment and interest rates, Bitcoin is more influenced by liquidity and speculative flows. “This behaviour suggests that, despite overlapping narratives, Bitcoin and gold have been absorbing macro flows differently — likely driven by Bitcoin’s higher volatility, more speculative positioning, and greater sensitivity to liquidity shifts,” the report stated. Notably, in 2025, as economic uncertainty grew mostly from trade tariffs, gold has rallied as a safe haven, while Bitcoin mostly held firm above the $100,000 mark. Bitcoin price analysis The Binance findings come as Bitcoin faces short-term volatility mainly from geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Before the escalation, Bitcoin nearly reached $110,000 but has since retraced. By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $103,897, down almost 2% in the last 24 hours and over 3% for the week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Despite the recent price drop, Binance pointed out that demand for the asset remains strong, especially when considering spot BTC exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ). To this end, these products have seen $2.4 billion in net inflows over eight days through June 18, indicating that long-term investors continue to buy the dip.

2025-06-21T13:46:09,"Crypto Market Slows Down as Fed Rate Cut Expected in September","The post Crypto Market Slows Down as Fed Rate Cut Expected in September appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is hovering near $103,700. There is growing uncertainty in its price action as global tensions rise. Retail sentiment is also weakening, adding to the pressure on BTC. But the current dip may just be a cool-off phase, and not the end of the bull cycle. Retail Sentiment Hits April Lows Crypto analytics firm Santiment shared recently that the retail sentiment has turned sharply negative, hitting its lowest point since early April. This is similar to levels seen in April, just before Bitcoin rebounded. With bearish comments rising, the panic could signal a rebound. The Fed rates are also steady, which has kept BTC stuck between $100K and $ 110 K. On-chain data shows that whales are accumulating while traders pull back. A Healthy Cool-Off Phase? The crypto market is currently in a slow correction phase. Altcoins have been declining since December, while Bitcoin remains stuck between $100K and $ 107K. Ethereum is struggling below $3,000, and overall trading volume is dropping, which are clear signs that retail investors are staying out for now. However, there have been no major crashes or negative events. This is a typical cooling-off period within a larger uptrend, similar to what happened in 2017 and 2021. These phases often follow major rallies and can last a few months. Looking ahead, there is a positive macro signal too. The Fed may cut rates in September, with a 71.8% chance according to CME FedWatch. This could boost crypto markets, and even the anticipation of rate cuts can lift sentiment and bring life back to risk assets. Cycle May Extend Into 2026 Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal also believes that the current crypto market closely resembles 2017, when Bitcoin rose steadily before exploding in December. He notes that macro conditions indicate that this cycle could be longer than expected, possibly extending into Q2 2026. Many long traders were recently wiped out on Binance as open interest dropped. This “cleanup” happened right after the Fed paused rate hikes. With fewer traders now in risky positions and past trends showing Bitcoin often rises after such events, CryptoQuant analysts see this as a potential setup for a Bitcoin bounce.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/james-wynn-predicts-bitcoin-crash-adds-70m-to-short-position/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BNB","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news",cryptocompare

The loss is tied to the 14.4 million shares employees were required to sell during the offering to facilitate the public listing. Billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya confirmed: In order to get the IPO off, the team at Circle had to sell 14.4M shares at the IPO price of $31 for total proceeds of $ 446 M. These shares were ‘bought’ by the IPO bank and then sold to their best clients. Chamath Palihapitiya Investor Palihapitiya believes a SPAC merger would have been better for Circle In just 15 days, Circle’s market cap was close to surpassing the $50 billion mark , following the huge spike in stock. However, employees have had to part with about $3 billion over the required share sell-off in the same period. As part of the IPO process, the USDC stablecoin issuer sold 14.4M shares, now valued at $3.456 B. Palihapitiya hoped the company would opt for a SPAC merger rather than the traditional IPO listing. He argued that, as much as the company disapproves of SPAC founder promotions or other forms of value transfer to intermediaries, traditional IPOs have value moved to arbitrary parties, which, in his words, “makes no sense.” He added that the benefits of SPACs and direct listings are clearly laid out from the start, which can be negotiated and optimized to serve the interests of selling and buying shareholders, unlike traditional IPOs. He stated that banks show more opacity with IPOs, and the media only adds to the problem by celebrating first-day stock jumps, which is sometimes not a great sign. He suggested it could indicate the deal was mispriced, allowing banks to hand out free stock to their top clients, many of whom had no connection to the company. Like with the case of Circle , the $3 billion went to unknown people who had nothing to do with the company, its employees, or investors. More companies are opting for SPAC mergers, including SRM Entertainment Recently, Tron Founder Justin Sun revealed his partnership with SRM Entertainment, opting for a SPAC merger rather than going through a conventional IPO. SRM Entertainment is set to change to Tron Inc., with some reports suggesting that Dominari Securities—a boutique investment bank linked to former President Donald Trump—will oversee the reverse merger. SRM Entertainment also confirmed that they agreed on a $100 million equity investment and that it would issue preferred shares and warrants that could raise the deal’s value to about $210 million. The company also stated that its gains will be directed to a Tron Reserve. Earlier this month, Parataxis Holdings , a BTC investment platform, announced it would go public through a SPAC merger with SilverBox Corp IV. The merger would help the company focus on institutional-grade Bitcoin and increase its appeal in public markets. Joe Reece, co-managing partner at SilverBox Capital, asserted that their collaboration would bring a unique and highly scalable digital asset management platform to the public markets.

2025-06-21T13:40:15,"US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Maintain Strong Momentum with 9th Straight Day of Inflows","BitcoinWorld US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Maintain Strong Momentum with 9th Straight Day of Inflows Hey crypto enthusiasts! Let’s dive into some encouraging news from the world of institutional Bitcoin adoption. The latest data shows a significant milestone for US spot Bitcoin ETFs, logging their ninth consecutive day of net positive inflows. This steady stream of capital is certainly catching the attention of market watchers. What Exactly Are US Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Why Do Inflows Matter? Before we break down the numbers, let’s quickly touch on what we’re talking about. US spot Bitcoin ETFs are investment vehicles that allow people to gain exposure to the price of Bitcoin (BTC) without directly buying and holding the cryptocurrency itself. The ‘spot’ part means these funds ideally hold actual Bitcoin to back the shares they issue. Think of it as a regulated, traditional finance wrapper around a crypto asset. Why are inflows important? Well, when a spot ETF records ‘net inflows,’ it means more money is coming into the fund than leaving it. To accommodate this new money, the ETF issuer typically has to buy more of the underlying asset – in this case, Bitcoin. Therefore, consistent net inflows into Bitcoin ETF inflows signal strong demand from investors, often large institutions or sophisticated wealth managers, which can have a positive impact on the price and overall market sentiment for BTC. Analyzing the Latest Bitcoin ETF Inflows: June 20th Snapshot According to data shared by Trader T (@thepfund) on X, June 20th saw a total net inflow of $6.32 million across all operational US spot Bitcoin ETFs. While this figure might seem modest compared to some previous days, its significance lies in the context: it marks the ninth day in a row that these funds have collectively seen more money enter than exit. Let’s look at the performance of the individual funds on that specific day: BlackRock’s IBIT: Continued its strong performance, leading the pack with a significant $46.87 million in inflows. BlackRock’s fund has consistently been a major recipient of capital since its launch. Fidelity’s FBTC: Experienced an outflow of $40.55 million . It’s not uncommon for individual funds to see outflows on any given day, even when the overall market is positive. These movements can be due to various factors, including portfolio rebalancing by large investors. Other Funds: Most other US spot Bitcoin ETFs reported no change in their holdings on June 20th. This data highlights the dynamic nature of the ETF market, where capital flows can vary between different products even within the same asset class. However, the key takeaway remains the aggregate net positive flow for the ninth consecutive day. What Do Nine Straight Days of BTC ETF Inflows Signal? A streak of consecutive net inflows, especially one reaching nine days, is a powerful indicator. Here’s what it suggests: Sustained Demand: It’s not just a one-off event. There is persistent buying pressure from investors utilizing the BTC ETF structure. Positive Sentiment: Despite recent price volatility in the broader crypto market, the consistent inflows suggest underlying confidence in Bitcoin as an asset class among ETF investors. Institutional Adoption: A significant portion of investment into US spot Bitcoin ETFs is believed to come from institutional players and financial advisors. This streak reinforces the narrative of growing mainstream and institutional adoption of Bitcoin via these regulated products. Potential Price Support: While not a direct one-to-one correlation, sustained inflows forcing ETFs to buy more BTC can contribute to increased demand in the spot market, potentially providing a level of price support. The performance of funds like BlackRock IBIT underscores which products are currently favored by investors channeling money into this space. Looking Ahead: The Trajectory of US Spot Bitcoin ETFs The launch of US spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year was a landmark event for the crypto industry, opening up regulated pathways for investment. The current streak of inflows, even with some funds like Fidelity FBTC seeing outflows on specific days, points towards continued interest. While market conditions can change rapidly, the nine-day inflow streak suggests that the initial excitement around these products hasn’t entirely faded. Investors are still actively allocating capital, indicating a longer-term view on Bitcoin’s role in investment portfolios. Key Takeaways from the Latest Data US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded their 9th consecutive day of net inflows on June 20th. The total net inflow for the day was $6.32 million. BlackRock’s IBIT led inflows with $46.87 million. Fidelity’s FBTC saw outflows of $40.55 million. Consistent inflows highlight sustained demand and positive sentiment for Bitcoin via the ETF structure. Institutional adoption continues to be a key theme driving these flows. In conclusion, the run of consecutive net inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs is a compelling signal of underlying demand and positive sentiment in the market. While daily figures can fluctuate between individual funds like BlackRock IBIT and Fidelity FBTC , the overall trend points towards continued interest and potentially growing institutional involvement in the Bitcoin space through these regulated investment products.

Powered by aggressive accumulation from smart money and whales, and supported by thinning exchange balances, the meme coin has hit a $100 million market cap and caught the attention of traders hunting for upside. While momentum indicators now flash caution, Useless Coin’s rise underscores the unpredictable nature of meme-driven markets—and the powerful role of investor sentiment. Useless Coin (USELESS) token jumped to a high of $0.1092 this week, up by over 1,750% from its lowest level in June. Useless token price jumped even as the crypto market crashed, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) falling from a record high of $111,900 in May to $103,000. Most Solana ( SOL ) meme coins have dropped this month, with their market capitalization falling from over $15 billion earlier this month to $9 billion. Nansen data shows that smart money investors have been buying the coin. Data shows that its smart money investors bought Useless tokens worth over $94,000 in the last 24 hours.

For example, the Average Directional Index has plunged from a record high of 70 to 20. The ADX is a popular indicator that measures the strength of a trend. The MACD and the Relative Strength Index have also formed a bearish divergence pattern, pointing to a potential retreat. Therefore, the coin may drop to the support at $0.50 as traders start to book profits.

The law specifically covers assets such as Bitcoin reserves that may be held outside the state treasury. The funds protected by the law include not only potential Bitcoin reserves, but also other strategic funds such as the Texas Advanced Nuclear Development Fund and the Gulf Coast Conservation Account.

2025-06-21T13:15:00,"Will Bitcoin Survive Without Trump? Hedge Funds Aren’t Convinced, Says Semler","Eric Semler, chairman of Semler Scientific Inc., believes many hedge funds remain unconvinced about Bitcoin’s long-term viability beyond the Trump administration. Key Takeaways: Eric Semler says many hedge funds doubt Bitcoin’s future beyond the Trump administration. Despite skepticism, Semler’s firm is aggressively building a BTC treasury, targeting 105,000 coins. Crypto exposure among hedge funds is rising, with nearly half now holding digital assets. Speaking in an interview with Natalie Brunell on Coin Stories, Semler said traditional finance still views Bitcoin as a fleeting trend that may not survive political transition. “I think that they think it is a fly-by-night concept and that it is probably going to, after the Trump administration, go back down a lot,” said Semler, who also founded TCS Capital Management. Trump’s Crypto Push Faces Uncertainty Beyond His Term His remarks come as debate grows over whether U.S. political support for crypto will endure past President Trump’s term. While Trump recently endorsed a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, figures like JAN3 CEO Samson Mow have warned that such initiatives could quickly unravel under a different administration. Despite broader skepticism, Semler has gone in the opposite direction. In May, Semler Scientific became only the second U.S. public company to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy. The firm currently holds 4,449 BTC and plans to ramp that up to 105,000 BTC within two and a half years, targeting 10,000 BTC by year-end. For Semler, institutional doubt is part of the opportunity. “When you’re making a bet on something that the majority doesn’t believe in, and you’re right, you make so much more money,” he said. “I love the negativity; I’m a contrarian investor,” he added, noting that his most profitable investments came when others were dismissive. “Those are the types of investments that have the highest returns.” While some hedge fund managers are still hesitant, the broader trend suggests rising crypto exposure. “We’re focused on becoming a powerhouse in #Bitcoin .” New episode just released featuring Chairman Eric Semler and CFO Renae Cormier of Semler Scientific $SMLR . Hear all about the company’s plans to aggressively stack Bitcoin and climb the leaderboard of public Bitcoin… pic.twitter.com/Rk0O4uab82 — Natalie Brunell (@natbrunell) June 19, 2025 A 2024 survey by the Alternative Investment Management Association and PwC showed that 47% of hedge fund managers now hold some level of crypto exposure, up from 29% in 2023 and 37% in 2022. Looking further back, a 2021 Intertrust Global survey of hedge fund CFOs showed that nearly all expected to allocate 7.2% of their portfolios to crypto by 2026. VanEck Warns BTC Treasury Strategy May Backfire Just recently, VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, raised concerns about the Bitcoin treasury strategies used by certain public companies, suggesting that continued accumulation of BTC could soon harm shareholders more than help. He specifically criticized the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, warning that they can become dilutive when stock prices approach the company’s Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). Sigel proposed several measures to prevent value erosion, including pausing ATM programs if a company’s stock trades below 0.95x NAV for over 10 days. He drew comparisons to past failures in the crypto mining sector, where excessive dilution and executive pay led to major shareholder losses. As an example, he cited Semler Scientific, a medical tech firm that entered the BTC space in 2024. Despite acquiring 3,808 BTC, its stock has fallen over 45%, and its mNAV has dropped to 0.82x.

2025-06-21T13:10:50,"Trump-Linked Nakamoto Holdings Raises $51.5M to Expand Bitcoin Treasury","Nakamoto Holdings, the Bitcoin-focused firm founded by U.S. President Donald Trump’s crypto adviser David Bailey, has secured $51.5 million through a private placement in public equity (PIPE) deal. The announcement came via merger partner KindlyMD, which confirmed the rapid fundraising was completed in under 72 hours, highlighting strong investor interest in the company’s BTC accumulation strategy. “Investor demand for Nakamoto is incredibly strong,” Bailey said in a statement. “We continue to execute our strategy to raise as much capital as possible to acquire as much Bitcoin as possible.” The new funding was priced at $5.00 per share, pushing KindlyMD’s total fundraising to $563 million — or $763 million when including convertible notes. The proceeds from this round will be used to purchase BTC, support working capital needs, and finance broader corporate operations. The PIPE financing will close concurrently with the finalization of Nakamoto’s merger with KindlyMD, which currently trades on the Nasdaq under the ticker NAKA. Building a Bitcoin Treasury Amid Market Caution Founded earlier this year, Nakamoto Holdings is modeled after other firms that have used Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset . Its mission is clear: amass a significant BTC treasury while the market offers a long-term opportunity. Despite mixed sentiment in the crypto sector, the company’s aggressive approach appears to be gaining traction with investors eager for exposure to Bitcoin’s potential upside. The merger with KindlyMD was approved by shareholders last month and is expected to be completed in Q3 2025. Post-merger, the combined entity aims to launch a series of BTC-native ventures, using a mix of equity and debt to fund operations and grow its BTC reserves. This move is part of a larger trend of corporate adoption of Bitcoin, signaling how digital assets are becoming increasingly prominent on company balance sheets. Growing Corporate Interest, Rising Risk According to data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET, at least 27 firms have added Bitcoin to their treasuries in the past month alone. The trend underscores a growing belief among businesses that BTC can serve as a hedge or strategic financial asset. However, not everyone is convinced. Fakhul Miah of GoMining Institutional warns that smaller firms may be jumping into Bitcoin out of pressure or hype rather than sound financial planning. Meanwhile, Standard Chartered cautioned that a BTC price drop below $90,000 could trigger liquidation risks for half of the companies holding BTC — potentially damaging reputations and shaking market confidence.

As volatility dries up and the price consolidates within a classic bullish wedge formation, momentum may return ahead of Pi Day 2 on June 28 and ongoing domain auction excitement. While risks remain, the stage is quietly being set for a possible rebound driven by both chart signals and fresh ecosystem developments. Technicals point to a Pi Network price comeback Yes, Pi Coin ( PI ) crashed into a deep bear market after plunging by over 60% from its highest point in May. It dropped to $0.5370 on Saturday, June 21, with its 24-hour volume falling to $74 million from a peak of $3 billion after its mainnet launch in February. The eight-hour chart shows that the Pi Coin price jumped to a high of $1.6675 in May. This surge happened as investors waited for the promised ecosystem news during the Consensus event in Toronto. It then plunged after the developers launched Pi Network Ventures , a $100 million fund to invest in startups. The chart shows that the MACD indicator has continued falling, a sign that it is not volatile. Similarly, the three lines of the Donchian Channels have narrowed, also a sign that they are not volatile. A period of low volatility is often a sign of accumulation among investors, which results in a bullish breakout.

For example, it could gain traction ahead of Pi Day 2 celebration on June 28. Also known as Tau Day, it is an alternative to the main Pi Day on March 14. This commemoration will happen on the same day that the .pi domain auction ends. Pi Domains had over 123,000 active bids and over 3 million bids during the auction. Another potential catalyst for Pi price is the ongoing ecosystem growth. In a note , the developers cited several applications that have launched on the network, including FruityPi, a fruit-matching game. Pi Network may also rebound as the odds of Federal Reserve cuts rise. In a statement on Friday, Christopher Waller, a Fed Governor, said that the bank may cut rates as early as July, which may benefit Bitcoin and other coins.

2025-06-21T12:57:24,"Forget Bitcoin – These 5 Altcoins Could Outperform Everything in the Next Bull Run","While Bitcoin remains the crypto market’s anchor, the real action in the next bull run might come from the shadows. A fresh wave of altcoins is quietly positioning for major moves — and savvy investors are already watching closely. From DeFi leaders to real-world asset pioneers, these five projects could not only rival Bitcoin’s performance but potentially leave it in the dust. Let’s break down which altcoins are flashing early signals of breakout potential. Worldcoin (WLD): A Deep Discount with Massive Upside Potential Source: tradingview Worldcoin may be trading between $0.87 and $1.15, but this consolidation could be the calm before a breakout. With key resistance levels at $1.32 and $1.60, a reversal could offer gains of over 85%. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) dipping below 40 suggests the asset is oversold, potentially setting the stage for a strong rebound. As the project continues pushing forward with global digital identity infrastructure, it holds the kind of long-term vision that often gets rediscovered during bullish cycles. If sentiment shifts even slightly, WLD could catch fire quickly. Hedera (HBAR): Ready to Rebound from Oversold Conditions Source: tradingview Despite recent pullbacks, Hedera’s current zone between $0.14 and $0.18 puts it at a strategic accumulation level. The RSI hovering near oversold levels hints that bearish momentum may be fading. If HBAR climbs past the $0.20–$0.23 range, it could quickly unlock upside potential. With an expanding ecosystem, carbon-negative network credentials, and enterprise use cases across banking, supply chain, and sustainability, Hedera remains one of the most undervalued Layer-1s. The next market rally may finally reward its steady and institutional-grade growth. Ondo (ONDO): Undervalued with Strong RWA Narrative Source: tradingview Ondo’s price action around $0.72–$0.89 reflects a market in wait mode, but technicals show a setup for reversal. Its RSI below 40 highlights undervaluation, and a move past $0.99 could unlock a clean run toward $1.16 or higher—a potential 30% gain. As a leader in tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), Ondo’s strong fundamentals could drive renewed investor interest when market confidence returns. With increasing institutional attention toward on-chain treasuries and yield products, ONDO could be a strategic long play in a sector that’s just getting started. Uniswap (UNI): Set to Break Free with DeFi Momentum Source: tradingview Uniswap is holding steady between $6.03 and $8.49, with signs of building momentum after gaining 11% over the past month. Key support at $4.89 looks solid, and if bulls break the $9 mark, UNI could target $12—a potential 50% surge. As DeFi adoption accelerates, UNI remains one of the top platforms set to benefit from renewed market enthusiasm. Its dominance in decentralized exchange volume and the upcoming V4 upgrade could serve as major catalysts. With the right macro backdrop, Uniswap could once again lead the DeFi narrative. Ethena (ENA): A Comeback Story in the Making Source: tradingview Trading in the $0.26–$0.36 range, Ethena may seem quiet, but the chart paints a different picture. The $0.22 support is holding strong, and a breakout above $0.42 could lead to a rapid push toward $0.52—up to 44% higher. With interest in synthetic dollar solutions growing, ENA’s use case could make it a major gainer when the next wave of buyers enters the market. The project is still in its early growth phase, and volatility often comes before momentum in emerging narratives. Ethena may be one sharp breakout away from renewed attention. Conclusion In a market where Bitcoin often takes the spotlight, it's easy to overlook the hidden gems brewing just beneath the surface. But as history shows, bull markets are defined by unexpected winners. Whether it's the tokenization of real-world assets, decentralized finance innovation, or next-gen identity protocols — these five altcoins are armed with strong narratives and favorable technicals. If the bull run kicks off soon, they may not just follow the trend — they could lead it. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-21T12:40:59,"Texas Enacts Crucial Law Safeguarding Bitcoin Reserves","BitcoinWorld Texas Enacts Crucial Law Safeguarding Bitcoin Reserves The Lone Star State is making waves in the digital asset space! Texas Governor Greg Abbott has taken a significant step, signing legislation that directly impacts how the state handles potential Bitcoin reserves . This move highlights Texas’s growing interest in and support for the cryptocurrency sector. What Does HB 4488 Mean for Texas Bitcoin Holdings? Governor Greg Abbott recently enacted House Bill 4488, a piece of legislation that brings important protections for specific state funds. At its core, HB 4488 is designed to prevent designated state funds from being automatically transferred into general revenue. Why is this significant for digital assets? According to reports, this protection explicitly extends to any Bitcoin reserves or other digital asset holdings that might be established outside of the traditional state treasury framework. This provides a layer of security and stability for potential state-held digital assets, ensuring they aren’t subject to routine sweeps into the general state budget. Here are the key takeaways from HB 4488: Fund Protection: Prevents designated state funds from being swept into general revenue. Digital Asset Inclusion: Explicitly includes digital asset holdings, such as Texas Bitcoin reserves, established outside the main treasury. Increased Security: Offers a degree of stability and protection for these specific digital asset holdings. This legislative action signals a proactive approach from Texas in creating a framework that acknowledges and potentially accommodates digital assets within its financial structure. Will Texas Soon Be Buying Bitcoin? Exploring Senate Bill 21 While HB 4488 is now law, the fate of another crucial piece of legislation, Senate Bill 21 (SB 21), remains undecided by Governor Greg Abbott Bitcoin policy actions are being closely watched, and SB 21 could represent an even bolder step. SB 21 proposes permitting the state to purchase digital assets. However, it includes a significant condition: the state would only be allowed to acquire digital assets with a market capitalization of at least $500 billion. Currently, only Bitcoin consistently meets this substantial market cap requirement. If signed into law, SB 21 could pave the way for Texas to become a direct holder of Bitcoin, potentially adding it to state investment portfolios or reserves. This would be a landmark move, positioning Texas at the forefront of state-level digital asset adoption in the U.S. Comparing the two bills: HB 4488 (Signed): Focus: Protecting *existing or future* digital asset holdings (like Bitcoin reserves ) held *outside* the treasury from general fund sweeps. Action: Defensive/Protective measure for digital assets. Impact: Creates a safer environment for state entities considering or holding digital assets outside the traditional treasury. SB 21 (Pending): Focus: Enabling the state to *purchase* digital assets meeting a high market cap threshold ($500B+). Action: Offensive/Acquisition measure for digital assets (specifically Bitcoin, given the threshold). Impact: Could potentially make Texas a direct investor in Bitcoin. The decision on SB 21 is highly anticipated, as it could significantly alter the landscape for Texas crypto bill initiatives. Why is Texas Embracing Digital Assets? Texas has positioned itself as a friendly environment for the cryptocurrency industry, attracting miners, blockchain companies, and innovators. This legislative push, including HB 4488 and the consideration of SB 21, aligns with that broader strategy. Several factors likely contribute to this stance: Economic Development: Attracting crypto businesses creates jobs and stimulates economic activity. Innovation Hub: Aiming to be a leader in emerging technologies. Diversification: Exploring alternative assets for state funds (as potentially allowed by SB 21). Property Rights: Framing digital asset ownership within existing property rights frameworks. Governor Greg Abbott Bitcoin -related actions are seen by many in the crypto community as a positive signal, indicating governmental recognition and support for the asset class. Benefits and Implications of the Texas Crypto Bill The enactment of HB 4488 and the potential passage of SB 21 carry significant implications: Benefits: Increased Legitimacy: State-level action lends credibility to Bitcoin and other digital assets. Attracting Investment: A clear legal framework encourages more crypto businesses and investors to come to Texas. Potential State Asset Diversification: SB 21 could open doors for diversifying state holdings with an uncorrelated asset like Bitcoin. Setting a Precedent: Texas’s actions could influence other states to explore similar legislation regarding Bitcoin reserves and digital asset ownership. Potential Challenges/Considerations: Regulatory Uncertainty: While Texas is acting, the federal regulatory landscape remains complex. Market Volatility: Holding volatile assets like Bitcoin carries risks, which would need careful management if SB 21 passes. Custody and Security: Managing state-held digital assets requires robust security and custody solutions. The Texas crypto bill landscape is evolving rapidly, and these recent developments are key indicators of the state’s direction. Actionable Insights for Readers What does this mean for you, whether you’re a crypto holder, investor, or simply interested in the space? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on state-level legislative developments, not just federal ones. Texas is a significant player. Understand the Nuances: Differentiate between protective bills like HB 4488 (safeguarding existing/future holdings) and enabling bills like SB 21 (allowing purchase). Observe Trends: Texas’s actions are part of a broader trend of increasing institutional and governmental interest in digital assets. The actions taken by Greg Abbott Bitcoin and crypto-related legislation in Texas provide valuable insights into how traditional governance structures are beginning to interact with decentralized technologies. Conclusion: Texas Solidifies Its Pro-Crypto Stance Governor Greg Abbott’s signing of HB 4488 is a concrete step by Texas to provide a protective legal foundation for digital assets, including potential Bitcoin reserves held outside the traditional treasury. While the decision on SB 21, which could enable direct state investment in Bitcoin, is still pending, the direction is clear: Texas aims to be a leader in the digital asset space. This Texas crypto bill activity not only supports the state’s growing crypto industry but also signals to the broader market that digital assets are increasingly being considered within established financial and governmental frameworks. As the landscape continues to evolve, Texas’s legislative actions will remain a key area to watch.

2025-06-21T12:30:55,"Peter Schiff Issues Warning on USD Stablecoins, Favors Gold","BitcoinWorld Peter Schiff Issues Warning on USD Stablecoins, Favors Gold Well-known economist and outspoken crypto skeptic, Peter Schiff , has once again stirred the pot in the cryptocurrency world, this time setting his sights on USD stablecoins . While Schiff is famously critical of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, his recent comments highlight a specific concern regarding digital assets pegged to traditional fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. Peter Schiff’s Skepticism: Why Question USD Stablecoins? In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Peter Schiff , who serves as Chief Economist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, articulated his doubts about the fundamental value proposition of USD stablecoins . His core argument centers on the backing asset itself – the U.S. dollar. Schiff has long been a critic of government-issued fiat currencies, particularly the dollar, citing concerns about inflation, devaluation, and government debt. His skepticism towards USD stablecoins stems directly from this view. He questions why investors would opt for a digital asset whose stability is tied to a currency he believes is inherently flawed and subject to losing purchasing power over time. According to CoinDesk’s report on his comments, Schiff believes that choosing a digital asset pegged to a depreciating asset (in his view, the dollar) makes little sense when alternatives backed by what he considers a superior store of value, like gold, are available. Understanding Stablecoins: Beyond the Fiat Peg To appreciate Schiff’s perspective, it helps to understand what stablecoins are and how they function. At their heart, stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to minimize price volatility, unlike assets such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. They achieve this stability by pegging their market value to another, more stable asset. The most common type are fiat currency -backed stablecoins , where each digital token is supposedly backed by an equivalent reserve of traditional currency (like USD, EUR, etc.) held in a bank account. Examples include Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), which aim to maintain a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar. Other types of stablecoins exist: Crypto-backed stablecoins: Over-collateralized with other cryptocurrencies (e.g., Dai). Algorithmic stablecoins: Use complex algorithms and smart contracts to maintain price stability without direct asset backing (these have proven highly volatile and risky). Commodity-backed stablecoins: Pegged to assets like gold, oil, or real estate. Schiff’s focus is specifically on the first category, the USD stablecoins , which he sees as inheriting the weaknesses of the underlying fiat asset. The Allure of Gold-Backed Stablecoins Given his long-standing advocacy for gold as a reliable store of value, it’s unsurprising that Peter Schiff sees gold-backed stablecoins as a more sensible alternative. Unlike fiat, gold has a history spanning millennia as a medium of exchange and a store of wealth, largely independent of government policies. Gold-backed stablecoins aim to combine the stability associated with gold with the benefits of blockchain technology – ease of transfer, divisibility, and potential transparency (depending on the specific implementation and auditing). Each token in a gold-backed stablecoin system is typically claimed to represent a specific amount of physical gold held in secure vaults. Schiff himself acknowledged the existence of such offerings and, in response to a user suggestion, even stated his intention to potentially launch his own gold-backed stablecoin . This move would align his digital asset strategy with his core economic philosophy, offering investors a digital way to hold an asset tied to physical gold rather than a fiat currency he distrusts. Benefits Highlighted by Gold Advocates: Store of Value: Gold is historically seen as preserving purchasing power over long periods, unlike inflationary fiat currencies. Hedge Against Inflation/Devaluation: Gold tends to perform well during times of economic uncertainty or currency devaluation. Tangible Backing: Represents ownership in a physical asset, not just a claim on fiat reserves. Accessibility: Offers a potentially easier and more divisible way to invest in gold compared to buying physical bars or coins. Challenges for Gold-Backed Stablecoins: Custody and Auditing: Ensuring the physical gold actually exists and is securely stored requires robust auditing and trust. Liquidity: May not be as liquid or widely accepted for transactions as major USD stablecoins . Fees: Storage, insurance, and management fees for the physical gold can impact the token’s value or incur costs. Regulatory Uncertainty: Like all cryptocurrencies, they face evolving regulatory landscapes. Fiat Currency: The Foundation Schiff Questions The heart of Peter Schiff’s critique lies in his fundamental distrust of modern fiat currency systems. Fiat money, like the U.S. dollar, is not backed by a physical commodity (like gold) but by the full faith and credit of the government that issues it. Its value is derived from government decree and public trust. Schiff and others in the Austrian economics tradition argue that central banks’ ability to print money and governments’ tendency to run deficits inevitably lead to inflation, eroding the purchasing power of fiat currency over time. This makes assets denominated in or pegged to fiat, like USD stablecoins , susceptible to the same devaluation. From this perspective, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar is only as stable as the dollar itself. If the dollar loses 10% of its value due to inflation, the USD stablecoin , maintaining its 1:1 peg, also effectively loses 10% of its purchasing power relative to goods and services. Navigating the Stablecoin Landscape: Insights for Investors Peter Schiff’s comments highlight a critical debate within the digital asset space: what makes a stable digital asset truly ‘stable’ or valuable in the long term? For investors, this raises important considerations: Actionable Insights: Understand the Backing: Don’t just see ‘stablecoin’; investigate what asset it is pegged to and how that peg is maintained (reserves, algorithms, etc.). Assess the Underlying Asset: Consider the stability and long-term prospects of the asset backing the stablecoin (Is it a fiat currency you trust? A commodity? Another crypto?). Evaluate Reserve Transparency and Audits: Especially for fiat or commodity-backed stablecoins, look for clear, regular, and independent audits of the reserves. Consider Your Goals: Are you using stablecoins for short-term trading liquidity (where USD stablecoins are dominant) or as a long-term store of value (where gold-backed stablecoins might appeal to those sharing Schiff’s view)? Diversification: As with any investment, don’t put all your eggs in one basket, whether it’s one type of stablecoin or just stablecoins in general. Stay Informed on Regulation: The regulatory environment for all types of stablecoins is rapidly evolving, which can impact their availability and stability. While USD stablecoins currently dominate the market due to their deep liquidity and ease of use within the crypto ecosystem, Schiff’s arguments serve as a reminder that their perceived stability is intrinsically linked to the health and future of the U.S. dollar itself. Alternatives like gold-backed stablecoins offer a different value proposition, appealing to those seeking digital exposure to assets historically viewed as hedges against fiat currency instability. Conclusion: The Ongoing Debate Over Digital Stability Peter Schiff’s skepticism towards USD stablecoins is a natural extension of his long-held views on fiat currency and the enduring value of gold. He challenges the fundamental premise of pegging a digital asset to a currency he sees as prone to devaluation, advocating instead for the stability offered by gold-backed stablecoins . This debate is crucial for the future of digital assets. While USD stablecoins currently serve vital functions in the crypto market, the discussion around alternative backing assets like gold highlights different philosophies on what constitutes true, long-term stability in a digital format. Investors must look beyond the ‘stable’ label and understand the underlying mechanics and assets that give a stablecoin its value, considering whether they trust the future of fiat currency or prefer assets with a longer history as a store of wealth.

2025-06-21T12:30:19,"Bitcoin Net Taker Volume Enters Deep Red On Binance — What’s Next For BTC Price?","After another strong play for its all-time high in the past week, the price of Bitcoin has struggled to build on its recent bullish momentum. Over the last few days, the premier cryptocurrency has been specifically slow and lethargic. On Friday, June 20, the Bitcoin price took a severe hit — together with the rest of the crypto market — and fell briefly beneath the $103,000 mark. However, the latest market data suggests that the price of BTC might enjoy some stability after the recent round of long liquidations. BTC Gearing For A Run Of ‘Healthier Price Action’: Analyst In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, on-chain analyst Amr Taha explained the dynamics between the Bitcoin price and its recent long liquidation event. According to the online pundit, the market leader could be preparing for more stable price action over the next few weeks. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Gearing Up for a Breakout? On-Chain Signals Say ‘Watch This Level’ Taha revealed that the critical $103,000 liquidation cluster, which held a large volume of overleveraged long positions on Binance, has been cleared off. This cascade of long liquidations came after the price of Bitcoin plunged toward the $102,500 level on Friday evening. According to data from CryptoQuant, the price decline caused the long liquidations on Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume, to exceed $160 million. The on-chain analyst noted that this long liquidation event also coincided with a major change in the Bitcoin Net Taker Volume on the cryptocurrency exchange. Taha highlighted that the Net Taker Volume has moved deep into the negative territory, falling to nearly -$100 million in the past day. As observed in the chart below, this latest plunge marks the third time the Net taker Volume has fallen to this level in the month of June. According to Taha, the change in this metric suggests that aggressive selling outweighed buying activity during the liquidation event. The on-chain analyst outlines two possible reasons for this trend, including that long positions were forced to close, pushing sell orders into the market as the Bitcoin price fell below $103,000. Taha added that some sections of Bitcoin retail traders might have pushed the panic button and filled new sell orders in fear of further losses. In the end, the crypto analyst concluded that the combination of long liquidations and extremely negative Net Taker Volume might not be completely bad for the flagship cryptocurrency. Taha said: While such events often feel devastating in the moment, they lay the groundwork for healthier price action. Given these dynamics, the path of least resistance may now shift upward as Bitcoin stabilizes above key support levels with reduced leverage overhead. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $103,450, reflecting an over 1% decline in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Gearing Up for a Breakout?

2025-06-21T12:30:00,"Ethereum holds the line: ETF inflows slow, yet bullish setup forms","Ethereum price remained inside a tight range this week as inflows into its exchange-traded funds slowed. Ethereum ( ETH ) dropped to a low of $2,400 this week as the crypto market crash continued. Its lowest level was down by 16% from its highest level this month, meaning it is in a technical correction. SoSoValue data shows that spot Ethereum ETFs added $40 million in inflows this week, down from $528 million a week earlier. It was the smallest increase since the week of May 16. There are two likely reasons for the significant drop in ETF inflows. First, these inflows slowed as investors remained in the sidelines as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies dropped. You might also like: Staked ETH eclipses 35m as crypto reserves fuel supply squeeze Second, inflows slowed this week because it had four working days in the US. Markets were closed on Thursday, which was Juneteenth, a federal holiday. On the positive side, Ethereum ETFs have had inflows in the last six consecutive weeks, the longest streak since their approval in September last year. The cumulative ETF inflows is $3.89 billion, bringing the total assets in these funds to $9.6 billion. BlackRock’s ETHA ETF had cumulative inflows of $5.28 billion, while Fidelity’s FETH has $1.1 billion. Ethereum price retreated as its ecosystem metrics deteriorated. For example, the stablecoin transaction volume in Ethereum has dropped by 31% in the last 30 days to $1.2 trillion. Ethereum price technical analysis ETH price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the Ethereum price has moved sideways since May 10. It has remained inside the support and resistance levels at $2,410 and $2,736. This consolidation is part of the formation of the bullish flag. This pattern consists of a vertical price increase driven by strong demand and a short-term consolidation. The bullish flag occurs between the 50% and 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement levels. It also occurs after the coin rises above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages. Therefore, the coin will likely have a strong bullish breakout as long as it remains above the lower side of the flag at $2,400. More gains will be confirmed if the price moves above the upper side of the flag at $2,735. If this happens, the next point to watch will be the psychological point at $3,000.

2025-06-21T12:20:48,"Urgent Alert: Altcoin Season Index Plunges to 19, Signaling Bitcoin Dominance","BitcoinWorld Urgent Alert: Altcoin Season Index Plunges to 19, Signaling Bitcoin Dominance Are you wondering why your favorite altcoins might not be performing as well as Bitcoin lately? The latest data from the Altcoin Season Index provides a clear answer, pointing towards a significant shift in the crypto market landscape. Understanding the Alt coin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool for cryptocurrency investors and traders. Tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), it offers insight into whether the broader market is favoring altcoins or Bitcoin over a specific period. This index helps gauge market sentiment and identify potential trends. Here’s how the index fundamentally works: It analyzes the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CMC. Stablecoins and wrapped tokens are excluded from the calculation to provide a clearer picture of speculative asset performance. The performance of each of these top 100 coins is compared against Bitcoin ‘s performance over the past 90 days. The index score ranges from 1 to 100. The threshold for determining market season is based on how many of these top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin : Altcoin Season: Occurs when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index score is typically high (above 75). Bitcoin Season: Occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index score is typically low (25 or below). Scores between 26 and 74 generally indicate a neutral or transitional market phase. Why the Altcoin Season Index at 19 Matters As of June 21, at 00:38 UTC, the Altcoin Season Index registered a score of 19. This figure is down three points from the previous day. A score of 19 falls squarely into the definition of Bitcoin Season . This low number signals that a significant majority of the top 100 altcoins have failed to keep pace with, let alone outperform, Bitcoin over the recent 90-day period. This shift isn’t just a number; it reflects capital flows and investor preference. During a Bitcoin Season , investors tend to favor the perceived safety and dominance of Bitcoin , often rotating capital out of smaller, more volatile altcoins . This can lead to Bitcoin seeing stronger price gains or holding its value better during downturns compared to the rest of the crypto market . Navigating the Current Bitcoin Season in the Crypto Market Being in a Bitcoin Season presents both challenges and opportunities for participants in the crypto market . For those holding a diversified portfolio heavily weighted towards altcoins , this period can be frustrating as their holdings may underperform relative to Bitcoin . Challenges during Bitcoin Season: Altcoin Underperformance: Most altcoins will struggle to gain ground against Bitcoin . Increased Volatility for Altcoins: Smaller cap altcoins can experience sharper drops when Bitcoin corrects or consolidates. Lower Trading Volume for Altcoins: Interest and capital can consolidate around Bitcoin , leading to less liquidity in some altcoin markets. Opportunities during Bitcoin Season: Potential for Bitcoin Accumulation: Investors focused on accumulating Bitcoin may find relative strength. Identifying Resilient Altcoins: Some altcoins may show relative strength even during Bitcoin Season , potentially indicating strong fundamentals or specific catalysts. Strategic Positioning: Understanding the current market phase allows investors to adjust their strategies, perhaps increasing Bitcoin exposure or waiting for the market to signal a potential shift back towards altcoins . What Does This Mean for Your Altcoins ? If you hold altcoins , the current Bitcoin Season means you should temper expectations regarding their short-term performance relative to Bitcoin . It doesn’t necessarily mean all altcoins will lose value, but their gains are likely to lag significantly behind Bitcoin ‘s, or they may even see declines while Bitcoin remains relatively stable or rises. Consider reviewing your portfolio: Diversification: Is your portfolio overly exposed to smaller altcoins ? Risk Tolerance: Are you comfortable with the increased volatility that altcoins might experience during this phase? Long-Term View: For projects you believe in long-term, periods of underperformance against Bitcoin can sometimes present accumulation opportunities, but caution is advised as further drops are possible. This phase underscores Bitcoin ‘s continued dominance and its role as the primary driver of overall market sentiment and capital movement. While the dream of massive, quick gains in small altcoins is often associated with Altcoin Season , the current data indicates we are in a different part of the market cycle. Conclusion: Staying Informed in the Crypto Market The Altcoin Season Index at 19 serves as a clear indicator that the crypto market is currently experiencing Bitcoin Season . This phase is characterized by Bitcoin ‘s relative strength and the underperformance of most altcoins . Understanding this market dynamic is crucial for making informed decisions. While market cycles can shift rapidly, the data suggests caution for aggressive altcoin plays and highlights the importance of monitoring Bitcoin ‘s performance. Keeping an eye on the Altcoin Season Index and other market indicators will be key to identifying potential shifts back towards a more favorable environment for altcoins in the future.

2025-06-21T12:10:44,"Bitcoin Open Interest Hits $96B: A Powerful Catalyst for Price Action","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Open Interest Hits $96B: A Powerful Catalyst for Price Action Hey there, crypto enthusiasts! Let’s dive into some exciting news straight from the Bitcoin market. We’re talking about a significant metric that’s been making waves: Bitcoin open interest . This figure has recently hit a staggering $96 billion, a level that has analysts buzzing about what could be next for the Bitcoin price . Understanding open interest is key to grasping market sentiment and potential future movements. It represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures or options, that have not yet been settled. A rising open interest, especially when paired with a rising price, is often seen as a bullish signal, indicating fresh money entering the market and increased conviction among traders. What’s Driving This Record Bitcoin Open Interest? According to insights shared by Cointelegraph and data from Glassnode, a major catalyst behind this surge is the introduction of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. These exchange-traded funds have opened up a new avenue for both institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. This influx of capital into the ecosystem naturally translates to higher activity in related derivatives markets, pushing open interest figures to new heights. Think of it this way: as more large players and traditional investors enter the space via ETFs, they often use derivatives for hedging, speculation, or complex trading strategies. This increased participation adds to the total number of open contracts, inflating the overall open interest number we’re seeing today. Exploring the Realized Cap Leverage Ratio Beyond just the raw open interest number, another crucial metric is the realized cap leverage ratio. Glassnode data indicates this ratio has climbed to 10.2%. Now, what does that mean in plain English? The realized cap leverage ratio compares the total open interest to the realized capitalization of Bitcoin. Realized cap values each Bitcoin at the price it was last moved on-chain. It’s often seen as a more accurate measure of the network’s true value held by long-term holders compared to market capitalization, which uses the current price for all coins. A higher realized cap leverage ratio suggests that the amount of capital tied up in derivatives is significant relative to the underlying ‘realized’ value of Bitcoin held by investors. The current level of 10.2% places it in the top 10.8% of trading days since 2018. This historical context is important – it tells us that while not unprecedented, the current level of leverage in the system is relatively high compared to most periods over the last six years. Why Does High Leverage Matter for the Bitcoin Price? High crypto leverage can be a double-edged sword: Bullish Potential: When the market is moving upwards, high leverage amplifies gains. Traders with leveraged long positions profit significantly from small price increases, potentially adding fuel to the rally as positions stay open or are added to. The large pool of open interest can act as potential buying pressure if these leveraged long positions are confident and maintain their exposure. Increased Risk: This is where the other edge cuts. High leverage means positions are more sensitive to price swings. A sudden downturn can quickly lead to margin calls and forced liquidations. The Shadow of Liquidation Risk While high open interest and leverage can certainly boost upside potential for the Bitcoin price , they also significantly heighten the risk of cascading liquidations. This is a critical challenge to consider in the current market environment. Here’s how liquidation risk works: Traders open leveraged positions (e.g., betting on the price going up using borrowed funds). If the price moves against their position (e.g., starts to fall), their margin (collateral) can become insufficient to cover potential losses. Exchanges automatically close these positions to prevent losses exceeding the margin. This forced selling is a ‘liquidation’. A large number of liquidations happening rapidly can create a domino effect, pushing the price down further, triggering more liquidations, and leading to sharp, rapid declines – often called a ‘long squeeze’ if it’s primarily leveraged long positions being closed. Given the current high leverage levels, the market is arguably more susceptible to such a cascade event. A relatively modest price drop could potentially trigger a wave of selling pressure from forced liquidations, accelerating the decline. Putting It All Together: What Does This Mean for the Market? The surge in Bitcoin open interest to $96 billion, supported by the structural shift brought by Bitcoin ETFs and reflected in a high realized cap leverage ratio, paints a complex picture for the Bitcoin market . Key Insights: Increased Market Participation: The high open interest signals strong engagement from traders, likely fueled by new capital entering through ETFs. Potential for Volatility: The high leverage means that while upward movements could be amplified, the risk of sharp downward corrections due to liquidations is also elevated. Historical Context: While leverage is high relative to recent years, it’s important to compare it to previous market cycle peaks. Are we at levels seen just before major corrections, or is this a new paradigm driven by institutional entry? This requires careful analysis. Bullish Fuel vs. Bearish Trigger: The large pool of open contracts can act as potential buying power on dips or add momentum to rallies. However, it simultaneously represents a large pool of potentially vulnerable positions that could trigger a sell-off if the market turns. Actionable Insights: Manage Risk: Traders using leverage should be acutely aware of the increased liquidation risk . Setting stop-losses and managing position sizes are more critical than ever. Monitor Funding Rates: Positive funding rates in perpetual futures often indicate a bias towards long positions, which can increase the risk of a long squeeze if sentiment shifts. Watch for Price Catalysts: Given the coiled spring nature of a highly leveraged market, positive or negative news events could have amplified effects on the Bitcoin price . Long-Term View: For investors with a longer time horizon, short-term volatility driven by leverage might present buying opportunities, but understanding the potential for sharp drops is crucial. Comparing Leverage Levels: Is This Unprecedented? While the 10.2% realized cap leverage ratio is in the top 10.8% of trading days since 2018, it’s worth looking at historical peaks to gauge the potential impact. Previous periods of extremely high leverage have sometimes preceded significant price corrections. However, the market structure has also evolved significantly with the advent of spot ETFs and increased institutional participation. This makes direct comparisons challenging, but the historical data serves as a warning about the inherent risks of high leverage in any market. A table illustrating historical leverage peaks vs. current levels could be useful here, though creating a precise, dynamic table without live data is difficult. Conceptually, imagine columns for ‘Date’, ‘Realized Cap Leverage Ratio’, and ‘Subsequent Price Action (e.g., % change in next 30 days)’. This would visually highlight the correlation between high leverage and potential volatility. The Role of Bitcoin ETFs in Shaping Open Interest The launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs didn’t just bring new direct investment; it also integrated Bitcoin more deeply into traditional financial structures. This integration often involves the use of derivatives for various purposes, including: Hedging: Institutions holding physical Bitcoin (or equivalents via ETFs) might use futures or options to hedge against potential price drops. Arbitrage: Traders might exploit small price differences between the spot ETF price and futures prices using leveraged positions. Structured Products: The creation of more complex financial products built around Bitcoin can also contribute to derivative activity and open interest. This structural change suggests that a higher baseline of Bitcoin open interest might be the new normal compared to pre-ETF days, but the risks associated with high leverage still apply. Concluding Thoughts: Navigating the Leveraged Landscape The current state of Bitcoin open interest , sitting near record highs at $96 billion and accompanied by elevated crypto leverage , presents a fascinating and potentially volatile market scenario. The bullish narrative is strong, fueled by continued ETF inflows and positive sentiment, suggesting the potential for further upward movement in the Bitcoin price . However, the significant level of leverage simultaneously introduces substantial liquidation risk . A sudden market shock could trigger a rapid unwinding of positions, leading to a sharp price decline. For participants in the Bitcoin market , this environment demands careful attention to risk management. While the potential rewards are significant if the market continues its upward trajectory, the potential for rapid downside moves should not be underestimated. Keeping a close eye on market structure, funding rates, and overall sentiment is crucial for navigating this highly leveraged landscape successfully.

2025-06-21T12:05:08,"Raoul Pal Says Current Crypto Market Echoes 2017, Eyes Extended Bull Cycle into 2026","Crypto markets may be in the early stages of a longer-than-expected bull cycle, according to Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal. In a video released Thursday, Pal compared the current market structure to that of 2017, when Bitcoin steadily climbed throughout the year before exploding in value by December. He noted that while the pattern is “spookily similar,” macroeconomic factors suggest this cycle could extend further — potentially into 2026. Pal bases his forecast on his “business cycle score,” a macroeconomic model used to assess where the global economy stands. Currently, the score remains below 50, indicating that economic momentum is still building. “It generally takes a while to climb up,” he explained, adding that this delay could stretch the crypto bull market timeline. Weakening Dollar Points to Longer Crypto Upside Potential One of the major indicators supporting Pal’s outlook is the weakening U.S. dollar. Since January 1, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has dropped nearly 9%, now hovering around 98.77. Given the inverse correlation between crypto and the dollar , a continued decline in the greenback could further bolster Bitcoin’s appeal as both a speculative asset and a hedge against fiat devaluation. Bitcoin’s historical price data from 2017 supports Pal’s analogy. Starting the year at around $1,044, it reached $2,187 by the end of May and closed the year at $14,156 — a gain of over 1,200%. This pattern of gradual growth followed by an explosive Q4 rally mirrors what Pal sees in today’s market, although macro conditions may push the peak further out. He also noted that this cycle may resemble 2020 more than 2021, suggesting the current phase is still early in its growth curve. “The whole cycle got shifted because rates didn’t get adjusted, and the dollar moved sideways for a while,” Pal added. Middle East Bets Big on AI and Blockchain Another promising signal for the future of crypto, Pal said, comes from institutional interest in the Middle East. On a recent trip to the region, he spoke with Sovereign Wealth Funds and reported a strong, unified mandate across countries like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, and Bahrain. “The mandate is AI and blockchain,” Pal said. He emphasized that these nations are not only interested in holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset but are also planning to build government infrastructure using blockchain technology .

Solana coin price could reach a potential high of $400 in 2025. With a potential surge, the SOL price could hit $1,351 by 2030. Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer,” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. In a recent feat, Solana Strategies has planned to raise $1 billion to boost the ecosystem. Talking about numbers, the Solana price currently trades at a discount of 51.59% from its ATH of $ 294.33. Following this, crypto investors are storming Google with questions like “Will Solana Go Back Up?” or “How high can Solana go?” and “Will SOL price reach $500 this altcoin season?” To answer more such questions, we bring to you our Solana price prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030. We’ll address these queries using our analyses, market sentiments, and regular updates from the crypto world.

The RSI near 40.12 hints at the lack of strong momentum for a recovery. It is worth mentioning that a breakout above $170 could trigger a rally toward the $185 to $190 resistance zone. However, a failure to hold above $150 may floor the price to $140. That being said, Solana crypto is likely to trade sideways with an inclination to the bulls until the next fortnight. Potential High: $190 Average Price Range: $165 Potential Low: $140 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the derivatives market with $6.56B in open interest, far surpassing other altcoins. The heatmap and high trader positioning signal elevated volatility ahead. Any major price move in SOL could trigger significant market reactions, making it a key token to watch in the coming sessions. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.
