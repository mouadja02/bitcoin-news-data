2025-06-21T11:57:28,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Volatility Surges – What Technical Price Levels Are Traders Watching?","Bitcoin (BTC) is back under pressure, sliding beneath a critical support zone at $104,000 as short-term technical indicators signal a potential bearish continuation. At the time of writing, BTC trades around $103,829, down over 2% in the last 24 hours. With 24-hour volume surging to $46.6 billion, volatility has returned, but price action remains indecisive. On the 2-hour chart, Bitcoin is trapped beneath a descending trendline and has failed to hold the 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $104,657. A bearish engulfing candle near the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement at $104,028 was quickly followed by a drop to the $103,000 range. MACD momentum has turned negative, with widening divergence between signal and MACD lines, suggesting a deepening selloff. Key Technical Levels: Resistance: $104,657 (EMA), $105,238 (Fib 0.5) Support: $103,000, then $102,499 and $101,437 MACD: Bearish crossover confirmed A bearish Bitcoin price prediction could occur if BTC closes below $103K with high volume, potentially leading to further declines toward $100,451. Semler’s 105K Bitcoin Bet Shows Institutional Confidence While short-term price action remains cautious, institutional confidence in Bitcoin appears to be strengthening. Semler Scientific announced plans to expand its Bitcoin holdings from 4,449 to 105,000 by 2027, and appointed BTC strategist Joe Burnett to oversee the effort. BIG MOVE: Semler Scientific is going all-in on $BTC , planning to boost its holdings from 3,808 to a whopping 105,000 BTC by 2027! They aim for 10,000 BTC by year-end and 42,000 by 2026. With a 287% yield, they’re riding the corporate Bitcoin wave! #Bitcoin #Crypto — ChainGPT AI Agent (@ChainGPTAI) June 20, 2025 Even amid Friday’s broader crypto pullback, Semler’s stock jumped 14%, underscoring investor enthusiasm for long-term accumulation strategies. According to the firm, their goal is to hold 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025, setting the tone for more corporate treasuries to follow. Although BTC remained largely unmoved by the announcement, these longer-term signals of demand may lay the groundwork for future price stability above $100,000. Regulation Looms as Fraud Spurs ATM Crackdown And then there was the Bitcoin ATM news in Texas where a sheriff took $32,000 from a crypto machine to help recover $25,000 stolen in a government impersonation scam. The story went viral, and now everyone’s talking about whether this will lead to stricter regulations on Bitcoin ATMs. Jasper County sheriff recovers $32K from Bitcoin ATM after local scam, sparking debate over crypto privacy and enforcement methods. #BitcoinATM #LawEnforcement https://t.co/iqtiwD9xZH — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 20, 2025 In 2024 alone, crypto ATM fraud has resulted in $246 million in losses. While this doesn’t mean Bitcoin is the problem, tighter oversight could limit retail crypto access and slow down transaction volume for a bit. At the macro level, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said interest rate cuts could come as early as July if labor markets get weaker. Lower rates are good for risk assets like Bitcoin, but so far, BTC is waiting for more confirmation. Summary: BTC trades near $103.8K as MACD turns bearish Semler Scientific plans to accumulate 105,000 BTC Texas Bitcoin ATM raid triggers debate over retail access Fed rate cut speculation builds, but BTC holds steady As volatility climbs, traders are closely watching $103,000. A break below could set the stage for retests of $101,437 or even $100,451.

2025-06-21T11:49:20,"Nakamoto Holdings Raises $51.5M in 72 Hours to Buy More Bitcoin!","The post Nakamoto Holdings Raises $51.5M in 72 Hours to Buy More Bitcoin! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Backed by Trump’s crypto advisor David Bailey, Nakamoto Holdings has secured $51.5 million in lightning-fast funding—fueling its bold Bitcoin treasury ambitions. Investor Frenzy Sends Bitcoin Treasury Play into Overdrive Nakamoto Holdings, a rising Bitcoin treasury firm led by U.S. President Trump’s crypto advisor David Bailey, has raised $51.5 million via a PIPE (private investment in public equity) round. The deal was confirmed by merger partner KindlyMD and priced at $5.00 per share, completed in under 72 hours. “Investor interest in Nakamoto is exceptionally high,” said Bailey . “We’re staying focused on raising capital to buy as much Bitcoin as possible.” This latest round brings KindlyMD’s total funding to $563 million, and with convertible notes, the merged entity now commands $763 million in capital—setting the stage for Nakamoto’s aggressive BTC buying spree. Building a Bitcoin Treasury Powerhouse Nakamoto Holdings aims to rival giants like MicroStrategy and Europe’s Blockchain Group, which recently added $20 million in Bitcoin to its $170 million stash. The newly raised funds will primarily go toward Bitcoin acquisitions, with the remainder covering business operations. The move aligns with Nakamoto’s pending merger with Nasdaq-listed KindlyMD, set to close in Q3 2025. Merger Unlocks Bitcoin-Native Financial Innovation Following shareholder approval last month, KindlyMD’s merger with Nakamoto will give rise to a Bitcoin-focused financial entity—designed to build Bitcoin-native businesses through equity, debt instruments, and strategic investments. The momentum comes as 27 companies added BTC to their balance sheets, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET—signaling a wave of corporate Bitcoin adoption . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Demand Momentum Shows Bears Are Giving Up – Price Reversal Ahead? , Risks Remain in a Volatile Market Despite the bullish narrative, not all analysts are convinced.

2025-06-21T11:30:49,"Pundit Claims BlackRock Has Two Special Dates For XRP Holders, Legal Expert Reacts","A recent claim by crypto influencer Bale has reignited speculative chatter within the XRP community after he alleged that a contact at BlackRock privately shared two key dates tied to XRP’s future. While the post was vague and lacked verifiable detail, it prompted immediate attention and skepticism from XRP holders and legal experts alike. Bale’s Bold Claim Sparks Buzz Bale’s post read: “So I met my guy from BlackRock in NYC for a coffee. He gave me 2 new XRP dates to watch. Adoption is coming.” Though not the first time the influencer has made such insinuations, this latest statement comes at a sensitive time for XRP, with heightened expectations surrounding institutional interest and regulatory clarity. The reference to “two new XRP dates” sparked a flurry of speculation among retail investors, many of whom remain hopeful that financial giants like BlackRock could eventually integrate XRP into their digital asset strategies. However, Bale offered no evidence, context, or timeline, fueling doubt about the authenticity of his claim. Only after he swore you to the code of silence surely? https://t.co/rVk43Rrw4F — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 21, 2025 Bill Morgan Responds with Sarcasm Legal expert Bill Morgan, widely respected in the XRP community for his grounded analysis of the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit, swiftly weighed in on the post. In a sardonic response, Morgan wrote, “Only after he swore you to the code of silence, surely?”—a pointed jab at the cryptic nature of Bale’s message. Morgan’s reply wasn’t merely humorous; it highlighted a recurring issue in crypto circles—unsubstantiated claims from influencers that lack transparency or factual grounding. As someone who has consistently advocated for legal accuracy over hype, Morgan’s tone reflected the increasing frustration among informed XRP supporters. Community Reactions: Support for Morgan, Scrutiny for Bale The XRP community, often dubbed the “XRP Army” reacted swiftly, with many praising Morgan’s stance. One user, xrp-dan, noted: “He’s posted this a few times.” Morgan, in agreement, replied: “Few too many times,” signaling a broader concern over repetitive, baseless claims. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another user, Mars0634, applauded Morgan for calling out misinformation, saying: “Brilliant Bill pulling up the many lies posted on X about XRP by these so-called influencers. Love it, keep it up.” Meanwhile, Guy Schiefelbein offered a more neutral perspective: “Arr you got to give it to Bale for being consistent.” The overall sentiment leaned toward skepticism, with many users reinforcing the need for credible updates rather than recycled promises. No Evidence of BlackRock Involvement with XRP Despite Bale’s assertion, there is no public record or official statement linking BlackRock to any direct interest in XRP. While BlackRock has explored tokenization, launched a Bitcoin ETF, and shown broader interest in digital assets, it has not announced any XRP-specific initiatives. In the absence of concrete evidence, such speculative posts serve only to inflate expectations and mislead new investors. Ripple vs. SEC: The Real Dates to Watch As XRP’s price and adoption outlook remain closely tied to regulatory outcomes, the most significant dates for the community right now lie within the courtroom. A decision on the final remedies, potentially including fines and injunctive relief, is expected soon. This outcome may directly affect Ripple’s business operations and the standing of XRP in the U.S. market. Until then, legal clarity, not influencer speculation, remains the most reliable signal for XRP’s institutional trajectory.

One such project now gaining major traction is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is being aggressively picked up by early adopters as a candidate for the best crypto to buy in 2025. Early buyers will get a preset profit of 100% ROI with the token going live at $0.06.

2025-06-21T11:20:49,"Trump’s Shocking $1 Trillion Savings Claim: What It Means for Interest Rates and the Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld Trump’s Shocking $1 Trillion Savings Claim: What It Means for Interest Rates and the Crypto Market Former U.S. President Donald Trump recently made a significant claim regarding the nation’s finances, suggesting that a specific action by the Federal Reserve could lead to massive annual savings. For those tracking the pulse of the Crypto Market , understanding such macroeconomic discussions is crucial, as they often provide insights into the potential flow of capital and investor sentiment. Let’s break down Trump’s statement and explore its possible implications for the broader US Economy and digital assets. What Did Trump Say About Interest Rates ? In a post on Truth Social, Donald Trump asserted that if Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell were to lower benchmark Interest Rates to a range of 1% to 2%, the United States government could realize annual savings of up to $1 trillion. This bold claim ties the direct cost of government borrowing to the Fed’s monetary policy decisions. Trump also used the statement as an opportunity to criticize the current administration, attributing what he sees as high costs to the policies enacted under President Biden. His remarks position the lowering of Interest Rates not just as an economic adjustment but as a significant fiscal maneuver with substantial savings potential. How Do the Federal Reserve’s Actions Influence the US Economy ? The Federal Reserve , often referred to as the ‘Fed’, is the central banking system of the United States. Its primary tool for influencing the US Economy is setting the target range for the federal funds rate – the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight borrowing. This rate serves as a benchmark that influences other interest rates throughout the economy, including: Rates on mortgages and car loans Interest earned on savings accounts and bonds Borrowing costs for businesses The cost of government debt When the Fed lowers Interest Rates , it typically aims to stimulate economic activity by making borrowing cheaper, encouraging spending and investment. Conversely, raising rates is intended to cool down an overheating economy and combat inflation by making borrowing more expensive. Trump’s argument centers on the government’s own borrowing costs. The U.S. government issues Treasury bonds and other debt instruments to finance its operations and existing debt. The interest paid on this debt is a significant government expense. Lowering market Interest Rates generally leads to lower yields on newly issued government debt, potentially reducing the government’s annual interest payments, which is the basis for Trump’s $1 trillion savings claim. Could Lower Interest Rates Really Save $1 Trillion? The potential savings figure cited by Trump is substantial and depends on several factors, including the total amount of outstanding government debt, the average maturity of that debt, and the speed at which lower rates would translate into lower borrowing costs for new or refinanced debt. Here’s a simplified look at the concept: The U.S. national debt is currently in the tens of trillions of dollars. A portion of this debt matures regularly and must be refinanced by issuing new debt. If the prevailing Interest Rates are lower when new debt is issued, the interest payments on that new debt will be lower. Over time, as more high-interest debt matures and is replaced by lower-interest debt, the total annual interest expense could decrease significantly. However, reaching a $1 trillion annual saving depends on a rapid and sustained drop in borrowing costs across a vast amount of debt. Economists have varying estimates on the potential savings from lower rates, and $1 trillion is generally considered to be at the higher end of projections, potentially requiring a more significant and prolonged rate reduction than the 1-2% target range mentioned by Trump, or assuming a very rapid turnover of existing debt. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve’s decisions are based on its dual mandate: achieving maximum employment and stable prices (controlling inflation). While the impact on government borrowing costs is a consideration, it is not the primary driver of monetary policy. The Fed must weigh the potential benefits of lower rates (like reduced government interest expense and economic stimulation) against the risks, particularly the risk of fueling inflation, which could ultimately harm the US Economy . What is the Potential Crypto Market Impact? Discussions around Interest Rates and the US Economy are closely watched by participants in the Crypto Market . Here’s why: Risk-On Sentiment: Lower interest rates typically make traditional, safer investments like bonds less attractive due to lower yields. This can encourage investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets, including stocks and cryptocurrencies. This is often referred to as a ‘risk-on’ environment. Liquidity: When the Fed lowers rates or engages in quantitative easing (another monetary tool), it generally increases the overall liquidity in the financial system. More money flowing through the economy can find its way into various asset classes, including crypto. Inflation Hedges: While the Fed’s goal with higher rates has been to combat inflation, some investors view assets like Bitcoin as a potential hedge against currency devaluation, especially if expansive monetary policies (like very low rates) are pursued over long periods. Comparison to Traditional Finance: As interest rates rise, the cost of capital increases for businesses, potentially slowing growth. For speculative assets like many cryptocurrencies, a lower-rate environment can make their potential future value more appealing compared to the lower returns offered elsewhere. If the Federal Reserve were to significantly lower Interest Rates towards the 1-2% range suggested by Trump , many analysts would anticipate this being a bullish signal for the Crypto Market , assuming other economic factors remain stable. Cheaper borrowing could also potentially free up capital for institutional or individual investors to allocate to digital assets. Navigating Economic Statements: Actionable Insights For those involved in the Crypto Market , keeping an eye on macroeconomic indicators and political commentary is important, but it’s crucial to approach them with a critical perspective. Distinguish Policy from Proposal: Trump’s statement is a proposal and a critique, not current Fed policy. The Fed operates independently and makes decisions based on complex economic data, not political directives. Understand the ‘Why’: Consider the context and potential motivations behind political statements on the economy. Focus on Fed Communication: Pay closer attention to official statements and minutes from the Federal Reserve ‘s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings for actual policy direction. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: While a significant shift in Interest Rates could have long-term implications for the Crypto Market , short-term market movements are influenced by a vast array of factors, including regulation, technological developments, and market sentiment specific to crypto. Do Your Own Research: Economic forecasts and the impact of policy are complex and subject to change. Rely on diverse sources of information and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions based on macroeconomic predictions. While the prospect of $1 trillion in savings is a headline-grabbing figure, the path to achieving it through significantly lower Interest Rates involves intricate economic trade-offs that the Federal Reserve must navigate carefully to ensure the long-term health of the US Economy . The reaction of the Crypto Market to any such policy shift would be just one piece of the larger economic puzzle. Summary Donald Trump has put forward the idea that lowering Federal Reserve Interest Rates to 1-2% could save the US Economy $1 trillion annually, while also criticizing current policy. While lower rates can indeed reduce government borrowing costs and historically tend to favor risk-on assets like those in the Crypto Market , the Fed’s decisions are driven by broader economic mandates like employment and inflation control. The potential savings figure is significant but depends on many variables. For crypto enthusiasts, this serves as a reminder that macroeconomic policy is a key factor to monitor, but official Fed actions and a comprehensive understanding of economic dynamics are more reliable indicators than political statements alone.

2025-06-21T11:19:59,"Wall Street Is Missing Coinbase's Leverage To The Next Supercycle (Rating Upgrade)","Summary Coinbase's stablecoin revenue has grown considerably in recent years. With institutional adoption on the horizon, the stock has considerable exposure to a new kind of institutional investment cycle, one focused on crypto's payment rails. Trading at only 18x Adjusted EBITDA, (as a run-rate) we think the stock appears quite reasonably priced. We're upgrading COIN to a 'Strong Buy'. Over the last few years, we've put out a number of articles on Coinbase ( COIN ), consistently calling the stock a ' Buy ': Seeking Alpha This is due to the fact that we see the crypto space growing in importance over the next decade, as the ecosystem's overall size, functionality, and accessibility begin to rival the traditional financial system. In the past, part of our bullish thesis has centered around Coinbase’s exposure to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Bitcoin trading volumes, which have historically made up a large portion of the firm's revenues. It shouldn’t be a surprise, then, that the stock has correlated strongly with Bitcoin's price since IPO: TradingView However, as stablecoin legislation makes its way through US Congress, and we see increased interest from 'traditional' companies in the space, we think the next crypto cycle is already taking shape. In the past, we’ve seen speculative frenzies dominated by meme coins, NFTs, and a fixation on both Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), perhaps to the exclusion of all else. Now, as decentralized finance apps and stablecoins begin to offer the world new payment rails for stable value exchange, we think COIN's services revenue will begin generating a majority of appreciation for shareholders going forward. Over the last few years, Coinbase has done an excellent job at cutting costs and diversifying its revenue base. Now, with the potential for massively increased institutional adoption, we think COIN's non-transaction revenues will power the stock's next leg higher. It’s true that COIN is expensive on some metrics, but when you break it down, we actually think the market is asking a reasonable price from investors. Today , we'll dive into the company's recent results, explain why we think COIN's diversified revenue should bolster margins and growth, and reiterate the case that we think Coinbase is 'one to own' for the years ahead. Sound good? Let’s dive in. Financials Our last coverage of Coinbase was in October of last year, and so before we dive into the recent updates that have reinforced our bullish view, it’s probably worth covering some of the recent numbers, just to get a sense of where the stock currently sits. In Q4 of 2024, Coinbase reported revenues of $2.27 billion, which represented 138% year-over-year growth. Similarly, the company reported earnings per share of ~$4.68, which came in well above analyst estimates. By all counts, this was a strong corner. In Q1 of 2025, results were a bit weaker, with revenue actually down sequentially, although still up 24% YoY. EPS also missed by quite a large margin: Seeking Alpha However, when you zoom out, much of this EPS volatility has to do with the company's 'Fair Value' mark of its crypto holdings. If you look at Coinbase from a cash perspective, the firm appears to be in a much stronger operating position. Once you strip out depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and gains and losses from the crypto portfolio, adjusted EBITDA for Q1 of this year was down only very slightly YoY, from $1.02 billion to $930 million: 10Q This reflects gaining momentum in the company's EBITDA, which has now — for several quarters — earned at roughly a $1 billion run rate. Annualize this, and Coinbase as a firm — subject to some volatility and trading revenues — is producing roughly $4 billion a year in adjusted EBITDA. Not bad! With some stocks, using adjusted EBITDA can be a tricky measure, but given that the majority of Coinbase's adjustments are correcting for crypto portfolio fluctuations, we think it’s actually a relatively fair representation of what’s going on, 'on the ground'. Frankly, when we first started covering the stock back in May 2023, Coinbase was just turning the corner on revenue diversification and cost-cutting. Now, two years on, the firm is pumping out solid, consistent adjusted EBITDA off the back of a diversified revenue base at the center of the regulated crypto ecosystem. We expect the company to continue making gains as institutional adoption increases. Recently, we’ve seen a number of headlines that bolster our view that increased institutional adoption is on the way. This week, the US Senate recently voted for and passed a bill giving much stronger legal footing to the stablecoin market. This is a big deal, especially considering the bill's bipartisan support. Now, with the stroke of a pen, Donald Trump could turn whatever final bill lands on his desk into a cohesive outline for how modern businesses can actually use crypto payment rails and free themselves from oppressive credit card fees. Additionally, as this legislation has advanced, we’ve seen comments from major retailers like Walmart ( WMT ) and Amazon ( AMZN ) that they’re looking into using crypto payment rails and stablecoins to reduce payment friction and increase profitability. CFOs at other companies may begin seeing the potential benefits of using stablecoins, and we expect Coinbase to garner a majority of this business. Revenue-wise, Coinbase is well-prepared to monetize this opportunity. The company is known for its retail and institutional trading platforms and brokerage capability, but COIN's revenue streams have now diversified to the point that in Q1 of this year, 35% of revenue came from stablecoins, blockchain rewards, interest, and subscription revenues from programs like 'Coinbase One': Seeking Alpha As we see it, COIN has numerous levers to grow from both traditional routes and increased institutional crypto adoption, and the stock should move beyond how many currently on Wall Street see it — as an underperforming Bitcoin wrapper. Valuation So, COIN's financials have improved, and we think the firm has considerable upside in the event of increased crypto adoption through its service offerings. Why does the stock look so expensive? In short, by some metrics, COIN is trading at a heightened multiple. You can see this in the stock's price-to-sales ratio, which stands at around 11x: TradingView There’s no doubt that this is high, both relative to the past , and nominally vs. the market . However, if you look at the company, Coinbase sports considerable operating margins—at least once you strip out the net income fluctuations from the crypto portfolio. In Q1, the firm produced $2 billion in revenue and $930 million in adjusted EBITDA. This is a nearly 50% cash margin. Not only that, but COIN is now producing roughly $4 billion in adjusted EBITDA, with a market cap of $75.2 billion. Broken down like this, the stock is actually trading at an 18x multiple. This appears MUCH more reasonable. We would argue that for a company that has so much potential upside, to such a large potential shift in the way this financial system works, paying 18x adjusted EBITDA appears like an incredibly fair price. Again, if you look at Seeking Alpha's valuation grade of Coinbase, you’ll find the stock's multiples look quite high versus the financial sector: Seeking Alpha In fact, the stock earns an 'F' rating. That said, many of these numbers are skewed dramatically by the 'Fair Value' fluctuations. Additionally, the company's lumpy results and uncertain growth catalyst timings make the stock look expensive. If Coinbase manages to continue growing EBITDA into the future, we think a purchase today at under $300 per share could be incredibly advantageous for investors. When you add up COIN's significant leverage to the next potential crypto cycle along with the diversity of revenue sources, high margins, and relatively attractive price point, we think the stock looks like a 'Strong Buy'. Risks Of course, when it comes to Coinbase, there are some risks to consider. First and foremost, many of COIN's revenues come from transaction fees from retail users. These still make up the lion's share of revenue. This means that a protracted lack of interest in the crypto ecosystem would also likely have a negative impact on Coinbase's revenue picture. This is what we saw in 2021. However, management has — as we mentioned — taken steps to reduce reliance on trading revenues, which, we think, makes the stock appear more well-prepared for an inevitable future slowdown. Additionally, many of the assets that trade on Coinbase’s platform remain without a regulatory framework. This presents a considerable regulatory risk for Coinbase. The stablecoin news is welcome but make no mistake — regulatory risk remains as Coinbase continues to offer altcoins that have (frankly) questionable status as securities. Management has done an excellent job navigating the regulatory storm in the past, but we think that’s possible that risks here could flare back up. This would likely ding the stock, at least in the short term. Summary Overall, though, we think COIN is incredibly well-prepared to capitalize on the next crypto cycle in a way that it hasn’t been able to before. With increased exposure to stablecoin revenues, reduced regulatory risk, and continued EBITDA margin strength, we think Coinbase's organic performance has a great trajectory. Coupled with a multiple that we think appears very reasonable, it’s hard to see the stock as anything other than a ' Strong Buy '. Thus, our rating.

The claims came after co-founder Jaz Gulati posted a snapshot of Garden’s Dune Analytics dashboard on X, boasting that it had collected $300,000 in fees over 12 days. ZachXBT responded to the post, bashing Garden of supporting Chinese-based laundering operations that helped move funds stolen in the Bybit hack by the Lazarus Group. “ You conveniently left out >80% of your fees came from Chinese launderers moving Lazarus Group funds from the Bybit hack ,” he reckoned. “ Who are you building for again? ” Crypto security analyst questions dashboard data According to the Dune dashboard, as of June 19, Garden Finance had processed 24,984 BTC in total volume, equal to approximately $1.5 billion in USD value, through over 40,000 atomic swaps. The platform’s largest swap to date was 10 BTC, while total reported fees collected stood at 40.11 BTC. Responding to ZachXBT’s claims, Gulati argued that “30 BTC fees came before the hack even happened,” attaching a Discord screenshot dated October 24, 2024, showing roughly 30 BTC in fees. this is great analysis since 30 BTC fees came before the hack even happened pic.twitter.com/C6A5F3BLsd — Jaz 🌸 (@jzgulati) June 21, 2025 The on-chain sleuth noted that he hadn’t even mentioned funds from “other DPRK hacks yet, like WazirX,” bashing the DeFi protocol for failing to flag the hackers’ transactions. Bybit’s hack, which occurred on February 21, 2025, involved a breach of the exchange’s cold wallet. Nearly $1.5 billion in Ethereum was siphoned from user accounts after attackers compromised a developer working on SAFE Wallet, a platform used by Bybit customers, five days ahead of the exploit. Several analysts, including ZachXBT, traced the stolen funds to laundering networks operating through DeFi bridges to the Lazarus Group . Gulati lambasted the blockchain security analyst by saying he was speaking from a point of “misinformation.” ZachXBT then asked : “ Explain how it is ‘decentralized’ when I watched in real time for multiple days as a single entity kept topping up liquidity from Coinbase for the Chinese launderers as they continued moving Bybit funds? ” explain how it is “decentralized” when I watched in real time for multiple days as a single entity kept topping up cbBTC liquidity from Coinbase for the Chinese launderers as they continued moving Bybit funds? — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) June 21, 2025 The developer is yet to respond to the question. Who helped Lazarus in the $230 million WazirX hack? In his accusations against Gulati, ZachXBT talked about the attack on WazirX , an Indian crypto exchange, where the Lazarus Group reportedly stole more than $230 million in crypto. That hack, which took place on July 18, 2024, was executed through forged smart contract signatures used to bypass WazirX’s multisig wallet protections. Hackers drained funds within an hour of gaining access. Similar to the Bybit case, investigators traced the exploit to North Korea’s Lazarus Group. Authorities in Japan, the United States, and South Korea later issued a joint cybersecurity alert identifying similar tactics used across both attacks. The group reportedly used social engineering, phishing, TraderTraitor and AppleJeus malware to target developer workstations and compromise their infrastructure. Crypto stolen in both hacks was subsequently laundered across decentralized platforms, often using mixers to obscure transaction trails. Garden Finance’s dashboard shows there was a spike in Bitcoin swaps between May and June 2025, with individual daily volumes peaking near 90 transactions in wrapped Bitcoin assets. The chart lists swaps by chain-token combinations such as base-cbBTC, ethereum-WBTC, and arbitrum-WBTC, with base-cbBTC recording the highest usage statistics. cbBTC, a wrapped Bitcoin asset pegged to Coinbase BTC, was mentioned by ZachXBT in his attack on Garden Finance, propounding that the platform was party to the untraceable movements of illicit funds from DPRK hackers .

2025-06-21T10:48:28,"Raoul Pal says the current crypto cycle is like 2017","Crypto research platform Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal has said the current crypto cycle is very similar to the one that was witnessed in 2017. According to Pal, Bitcoin posted a steady uptrend all through the year before skyrocketing towards the end of the year. The Real Vision CEO gave his verdict via a video, where he said, “It’s spookily similar to 2017.” Pal also said he is beginning to see a longer crypto cycle, forecasting that it might take a while this time around given the business cycle score. The business cycle score, according to Pal, is a macroeconomic model he uses to track the position of the global economy in the broader cycle. He added that it is still below 50 and it generally “takes a while to climb up.” Raoul Pal sees similarities in the current and 2017 crypto market cycle According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin started trading around $1,044 at the beginning of 2017, before rising to around $2,187 by May 31. The premier digital asset went on to close the year at $14,156, signifying a massive rise of 1,255% from the price at the beginning of the year. While Pal predicts the same movement, he acknowledges that a weaker US dollar could indicate a slower crypto cycle, which means it will take time before it reaches its peak. “With the dollar breaking down even today, it’s starting to suggest this may go into Q2 2026,” he said. Since the beginning of the year, the US Dollar Index has been down 8.995, sitting at 98.77 at the time of writing, according to data from TradingView. Bitcoin and DXY are inversely correlated. This means that when the dollar weakens, Bitcoin becomes more attractive not just as a speculative investment but as an alternative currency. Pal also added that macroeconomic data has been a primary reason why the crypto cycle has always shifted further back. “It’s like the whole cycle got shifted cause rates didn’t get adjusted; the dollar was sideways for some time,” he said. He also said that the current market may show signs of looking like the market in 2020 more than the one in 2021, suggesting that it could be at an earlier growth phase than many are predicting. Bitcoin began 2020 at $7,174, but dropped by 27% in March to $5,227. The asset then rebounded 129% to hit $11,990 in August, before witnessing a 304% increase, ending the year at $28,993. Pal added that the market needs to continue expanding to attract big players. He discussed his recent trip to the Middle East where he met with Sovereign Wealth Funds, adding that most of them were bullish on crypto. “The mandate across the entire region, from Saudi to Abu Dhabi to Dubai to Bahrain to Qatar, is AI and blockchain,” he said. He also added that things should evolve past just seeing Bitcoin as a reserve asset, noting that nations need to start building their entire government infrastructure on blockchain. Global governments have been making moves in the crypto sector since the beginning of the year. A typical example is Pakistan, with the country looking for ways to create a draft bill that could be passed in the near future to regulate digital assets. In addition, the country plans to formulate regulations that will protect its investors and attract global players into its digital asset hub. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Part of that is undoubtedly linked to Ethereum’s performance, which brings us to the next point: most best altcoins today might experience chart growth as well during this period. Here are three next crypto that could hit 1000x and that you should keep on your radar. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana’s Layer 2 Solution Promising Faster Transactions and Lower Network Costs Solaxy ($SOLX) is Solana’s upcoming Layer 2 upgrade that aims to fix Solana’s core issue: network congestion. In turn, this would allow for infinite scalability, faster transactions, and, more importantly, lower network fees. This is possible thanks to Solaxy’s off-chain execution and parallel processing, drastically reducing network latency and offering near-instant finality. $SOLX has just completed its presale run, accumulating over $56M with a price of $0.001766. If you’ve missed the presale, though, don’t worry, there’s still time to capitalize on $SOLX’s presale price. You have two days left until the token lists on public platforms, during which $SOLX is still available to purchase at its presale price. Solaxy is a meme coin with real blockchain utility that promises to upgrade Solana’s performance drastically in 2025 and beyond. This is the main reason why our analysts predict a price point for $SOLX of $0.032 by the end of 2025 . This would translate into an ROI of 1,712% if you invest today. Long-term, $SOLX’s performance should catch even more steam, reaching up to $0.2 or higher in 2026, for an ROI of 11,225% (or 113x). These predictions are based on $SOLX’s stated utility, the presale’s performance, and the idea that Solaxy will experience growing adoption and successful implementation post-launch. So, if you don’t want to miss this two-day window, go to Solaxy’s presale page and buy your $SOLX today. 2. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Solana Bot Sniping Hot Tokens on Telegram Snorter Token ($SNORT) is the presale of the coming Solana bot that snipes hot tokens for you on Telegram. Snorter Bot is the solution to manual coin hunting, which comes with problems like missed opportunities, the requirement for extensive tech knowledge, and the risk of running into pump-and-dumps, rug pulls, and honeypots. The Bot centralizes its entire activity in the Telegram chat, which translates to: No more juggling different wallets and browser extensions Higher comfort thanks to having everything in one place Real-time hot token alerts via the Telegram chat Snorter Bot comes with multiple tools to make your life, as a coin hunter, easier, such as the custom automated sniping, fast and secure swaps on the private Solana RPC infrastructure, and honeypot and scam protection. Snorter Token is in presale since May 2025, and has accumulated over $1.1M so far, with a token price of $0.0959. The project combines the coin’s meme potential with real-world utility, which is why we predict $SNORT to go as high as $0.94 in 2025 . This makes for a growth of 880%. Long-term, with widespread adoption and successful implementation, the token could step into wealth-building territory by 2030, with a chart price of $3.25, for an ROI of 3,236% if you invest at today’s price. In simpler words, a $100 investment in today’s $SNORT could reward you with $3,336 in less than five years; pure passive income. If you want to join the presale, go to $SNORT’s presale page, buy your tokens today , and consider joining the staking pool for the juicy 273% APY. 3. Ethereum ($ETH) – The Time Has Come to Embrace $ETH Ethereum ($ETH) has been on the rough side of the market for quite a while, but times are changing and now may be the time to buy. While the recent interest into Ethereum’s ETF performance dominates the headlines, let’s not also forget about Vitalik Buterin’s prediction that Ethereum’s Layer 1 could scale by up to 10x in 2026. The news didn’t impact $ETH’s performance in the charts, but we believe Ethereum may be cooking something. $ETH is still not in the green in the charts, but its downside seems to have slowed down. This could be a buy signal, considering the recent developments and Buterin’s promise of a 10x Layer 1 in 2026. Especially if we consider the 81% positive community sentiment and the 44% increase in the daily trading volume . Could the Coming Dogecoin and XRP EFTs Rally the Crypto Market? All signs point to the fact that, indeed, the crypto market may witness a sustained rally once ETFs get approved. Solaxy ($SOLX) and Snorter Token ($SNORT) are some of the best presales to 1000x as XRP and Dogecoin ETFs should launch in the coming months, potentially sounding the FOMO alarm. Don’t take this as financial advice.

2025-06-21T10:43:02,"South Korea’s First Bitcoin Treasury Firm Emerges with $18.5M Acquisition Deal","The post South Korea’s First Bitcoin Treasury Firm Emerges with $18.5M Acquisition Deal appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin treasury strategy is booming. Public companies now hold over 777,000 BTC—worth nearly $80.6 billion—and South Korea is jumping in. Parataxis Holdings has officially announced plans to create South Korea’s first publicly traded Bitcoin treasury company, signaling a bold shift in corporate crypto adoption across Asia. Parataxis Acquires Bridge Bio to Launch BTC Treasury Arm In a strategic move, Parataxis Holdings will acquire a controlling stake in biotech firm Bridge Bio for $18.5 million, according to the latest reports. After the acquisition, Bridge Bio will be renamed Parataxis Korea and will function as a Bitcoin-focused treasury company. The company confirmed the plan via press release , marking a historic first for South Korea. Inspired by MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Playbook Parataxis is following the path blazed by MicroStrategy , the most prominent public company holding Bitcoin. The firm, led by Michael Saylor, holds 592,100 BTC—valued at over $61.4 billion. Parataxis partner Andrew Kim revealed that the move is inspired by success stories like MicroStrategy and Asia’s Metaplanet, which holds 10,000 BTC. Kim emphasized Bitcoin’s long-term potential for shareholders and national economic value. Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Gains Steam in Korea Despite South Korea’s strict crypto regulations —such as the ban on spot Bitcoin ETFs —momentum for corporate adoption is building: A 2025 pilot program allows 3,500 companies to open verified crypto accounts. Lawmakers are pushing for spot crypto ETFs and won-backed stablecoins by next year. Parataxis CEO Edward Chin said the Bitcoin strategy is designed to benefit both investors and the nation. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Demand Momentum Shows Bears Are Giving Up – Price Reversal Ahead? , Top Public Companies Holding Bitcoin Here are the top public companies by BTC holdings: MicroStrategy – 592,100 BTC (~$61.4B) Marathon Digital – 16,930 BTC Riot Platforms – 8,872 BTC Metaplanet (Japan) – 10,000 BTC Boyaa Interactive (Hong Kong) and DDC Enterprise (China) also hold significant Bitcoin reserves.

2025-06-21T10:30:29,"Spot Crypto ETF Approval: Analyst Predicts Massive 90%+ Chance","BitcoinWorld Spot Crypto ETF Approval: Analyst Predicts Massive 90%+ Chance Exciting news is circulating in the cryptocurrency world, suggesting that a significant breakthrough for mainstream adoption might be just around the corner. A prominent voice in financial analysis has weighed in on the likelihood of a spot crypto ETF finally making its way to market, and their outlook is overwhelmingly positive. This development could pave the way for easier access to digital assets for both institutional and retail investors. What Are the Current ETF Approval Odds ? According to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart , the chances of seeing most spot crypto ETF applications receive the green light are remarkably high. Seyffart recently took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to share his analysis, asserting a confidence level exceeding 90% for the approval of these products. This figure represents a significant shift in sentiment compared to past years when such approvals seemed like a distant possibility. The analyst’s assessment provides a strong indicator of the growing maturity of the crypto market and the increasing inevitability of regulated investment products. Why Is Increased Communication with the SEC Approval a Positive Sign? A key factor contributing to Seyffart’s optimistic forecast is the noticeable increase in communication between asset managers applying for the ETFs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Historically, the SEC has been cautious, citing concerns around market manipulation, investor protection, and the nascent nature of the crypto markets. However, the recent engagement suggests a more constructive dialogue is taking place. This enhanced communication indicates that the SEC may be actively working through the concerns and technical details necessary for approving these complex financial products. It signals progress towards finding common ground and establishing the necessary regulatory frameworks. Navigating the Path to Crypto ETF Approval The journey towards crypto ETF approval in the United States has been a long and often frustrating one. While futures-based Bitcoin ETFs have been approved and are trading, a spot ETF, which holds the underlying asset directly, has remained elusive. Many believe a spot ETF offers a more direct and potentially less complex investment vehicle for investors. The SEC’s previous rejections have often centered on surveillance-sharing agreements and concerns about the unregulated nature of underlying crypto exchanges. The increased communication noted by James Seyffart likely involves addressing these specific regulatory hurdles and establishing robust investor safeguards. Insights from James Seyffart on Timing While the probability of approval is high, the exact timing remains uncertain, according to James Seyffart . He stated, “Could be something we’re talking about in the next month or two. Or it could be something that waits until October or later. Matter of when not if.” This perspective suggests that while the regulatory wheels are turning, the process still involves significant steps and potential delays. Investors and market participants should prepare for potential outcomes ranging from near-term approvals to those happening later in the year. The focus, as Seyffart highlights, should be on the strong likelihood of approval rather than fixating on a precise date. Understanding the Potential Impact of a Spot Crypto ETF The approval of a spot crypto ETF is widely seen as a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency market. Here are some potential impacts: Increased Institutional Investment: ETFs provide a familiar, regulated, and easily accessible structure for large financial institutions, pension funds, and wealth managers to gain exposure to crypto without directly holding the assets. Enhanced Retail Access: Investing in crypto through a traditional brokerage account via an ETF is simpler for many retail investors than setting up crypto exchange accounts and managing private keys. Market Legitimacy: Regulatory approval from the SEC lends significant credibility to the crypto asset class, potentially attracting more conservative investors. Potential Price Impact: Increased demand from new investor classes could positively impact the price of the underlying cryptocurrencies. Improved Liquidity: A successful ETF can add significant trading volume and liquidity to the market. However, potential challenges exist, including market volatility, concentration risk in specific assets, and the influence of large fund flows on price dynamics. Conclusion: High Probability, Uncertain Timeline The analysis shared by Bloomberg’s James Seyffart offers a compelling outlook for the future of cryptocurrency investments. The assertion of a 90%+ chance for widespread crypto ETF approval , driven by improved dialogue with the SEC, paints a picture of regulatory acceptance becoming a reality. While the specific timeline for these approvals remains fluid, the message is clear: it appears to be a question of ‘when,’ not ‘if.’ This development holds the potential to unlock significant new capital and mainstream participation in the crypto market, marking a pivotal moment for the industry.

2025-06-21T10:23:59,"Crypto Dip As Trump Says Iran’s Leader An ‘Easy Target’ But This DeFi Token Is Defying Odds","The post Crypto Dip As Trump Says Iran’s Leader An ‘Easy Target’ But This DeFi Token Is Defying Odds appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is reeling after President Donald Trump’s provocative claim that Iran’s leader is an “easy target,” sparking a sharp decline in major coins. Bitcoin dropped from $104,310 to $103,553 within an hour, while Ether and XRP fell 1.3% each. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index slid to “Neutral,” reflecting shaken investor confidence. Geopolitical tensions, intensified by recent Israel-Iran clashes, fuel this uncertainty. Yet, amidst this turmoil, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is defying odds, drawing attention as a promising defi crypto. Its presale, now in phase 5, has raised $10,900,000, with over 560 million tokens sold to 12,300 holders. Investors are flocking to this rising star. Bitcoin’s Stumble Amid Tensions Trump’s bold statement on Truth Social, hinting at Iran’s supreme leader’s vulnerability, sent shockwaves through crypto prices. Bitcoin, hovering above $105,000, briefly dipped below $104,000 before recovering slightly. Analysts warn it may test the $100,000 mark soon, with some predicting a drop to $93,000. The crypto fear and greed index, now at 52, signals caution among traders. This isn’t Trump’s first market jolt; his tariff policies earlier in 2025 also rattled investors. Consequently, many are questioning if crypto investment remains viable. Despite this, one project stands resilient, offering hope in a turbulent market. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing investor focus with its phase 5 presale underway at $0.03 per token, a 200% rise from phase one’s $0.01. The project has secured $10,900,000, with 12,300 holders owning over 560 million tokens. Phase 6 looms, bringing a 16.7% price hike to $0.035. At launch, MUTM will list at $0.06, guaranteeing a 100% return for current buyers. Moreover, analysts project a post-launch value of $2.50, suggesting an 8,233% gain from today’s price. This defi crypto’s momentum is undeniable, fueled by its innovative lending platform. Investors are taking note of its potential. Innovative Lending Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) redefines crypto investing with its dual lending system.

2025-06-21T10:23:58,"Crypto Bull Run Alert: Altcoins Set for 10x to 20x Gains in Q3","The post Crypto Bull Run Alert: Altcoins Set for 10x to 20x Gains in Q3 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The entire crypto market is tumbling under rising geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty, pulling its valuation down to $3.2 trillion with a modest 1.10% dip in the past day. A sudden 42% spike in trading volume hints at panic moves, while the Fear & Greed Index sits at 43, marking a neutral but uneasy mood. Bitcoin is trading at $103,491, down 0.94% with a daily low of $102,372. Moreover, a 38% spike in volume to $50.25B signals heavy trading, but not clear bullish momentum. Despite the bearish clouds, a popular analyst, Nathan from Investing Made Simple, says the Bitcoin bull market is far from done, and the best is yet to come. In his latest video , he laid out three distinct models that all point to one target: a parabolic move to $200,000 or more by the end of 2025. Three Data-Backed Models Point $200K Target The analyst first broke down Bitcoin’s historical cycle returns, noting that after every bear market low, BTC typically experiences exponential growth . From the 2022 bottom of $15,500, a 10–15x return places the top somewhere between $140,000 and $210,000, in line with previous cycles, though slightly more conservative due to market maturity. The second method used Bitcoin’s last all-time high of $69,000 as a baseline, applying the common bull market pattern of 2–3x gains from that peak. Again, this results in a target range of $140,000 to $210,000. Finally, he introduced the Power Law Model, which tracks Bitcoin’s price trajectory against time using logarithmic growth. This model not only suggests a peak around $210,000 but also forecasts the final blow-off phase to occur between October and December 2025, similar to what we’ve seen in past cycles. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Demand Momentum Shows Bears Are Giving Up – Price Reversal Ahead? , Altcoins Could See Explosive Gains in Q3 While Bitcoin price may grab the headlines, the analyst emphasized that altcoins could be the real winners in the final leg of the bull market. Historically, the last quarter of a cycle, when Bitcoin enters its parabolic phase, is when altcoins truly explode, often outperforming BTC by several multiples. The analyst also hinted that top-tier altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche could deliver massive returns, especially if money flows from Bitcoin into more speculative assets, as it typically does near cycle tops. Even mid- and low-cap coins could rally 10x to 20x, but the analyst warns this phase is usually short-lived, sometimes lasting just a few weeks. He added that timing will be key, and investors sitting on the sidelines too long may miss out on the most profitable window of the entire cycle. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-21T10:04:21,"Bitcoin Solaris: The $8 Token Set to Explode Like Early Bitcoin – Crypto Presale Already Raised $5 Million","The post Bitcoin Solaris: The $8 Token Set to Explode Like Early Bitcoin – Crypto Presale Already Raised $5 Million appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin’s first wave of gains went to early participants — the ones mining and moving BTC before it hit headlines. Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche followed similar patterns. The biggest returns always came before exposure, while networks were still small and tokens were still affordable. Bitcoin Solaris is in that phase right now. The presale is live at $8 per token. More than $5 million has already been raised by over 11,500 wallets. The projected listing price is $20 — locking in a 150% gain before a single exchange opens. But the difference here isn’t just timing. It’s function. BTC-S already powers products that reward users daily, with token velocity, live mining, and an expanding reward economy. Daily Rewards, Real Token Flow At the center of the Bitcoin Solaris economy is Nova — the mobile mining app that lets users earn BTC-S directly from their phones. It’s not a wrapped service or outsourced cloud pool. The system measures real usage and distributes token rewards based on device contribution, with no capital lockup or staking period required. Early beta testers out-earned some of the largest staking platforms, all without buying rigs or running wallets 24/7. The app is in active rollout, with more users onboarded as presale expands. BTC-S also moves through the Bitcoin Solaris Casino — an on-chain reward engine that distributes tokens daily. All verified users get one free spin per day, with instant payout chances. Buyers who hit specific spending tiers unlock larger reward pools, including up to 0.5 BTC in bonuses. The spin logic is automated and smart contract-driven — no centralized draw, no delayed credits. These systems keep BTC-S circulating before it even hits public markets. That flow drives demand, creates winners daily, and reinforces the core value loop that’s already running. Presale at $8, Capped Supply, and No Inflation Only 4.2 million BTC-S tokens are available in the presale. The total supply is capped at 21 million — forever. There are no future emissions, no inflation schedules, and no hidden unlocks waiting to dilute value. What’s being sold now is the only public supply until listings. At $8, the token is still priced under 40% of its projected launch value. With active products already distributing BTC-S and more utilities on the way, the price is still trailing the value. Every user participating now is ahead of both the listing and the demand wave that comes with it. The opportunity isn’t just in scarcity — it’s in position. This is the phase where utility already works, but market access hasn’t priced it in yet. Audited, Verified, and Already Covered by Analysts BTC-S isn’t just delivering functionality — it’s doing it transparently. The core contracts have been audited by Cyberscope . The Nova App’s mining logic was independently reviewed by Freshcoins . And the dev team has completed KYC verification to back investor safety. In a recent breakdown, Token Empire called Bitcoin Solaris the only project under $10 where rewards are moving, products are active, and upside hasn’t been locked out. Product Momentum Is Pushing Value Forward BTC-S isn’t sitting in wallets. It’s circulating. Between Nova and the Casino, tokens are moving daily, creating reward loops that continue to grow as new users join in. The next expansion is the Mining Power Marketplace — a live-use platform that lets users monetize unused processing power or rent capacity using BTC-S. The feature is already in development and ties directly into the network’s value cycle. Wallet upgrades, testnet deployment, and developer tools are all scheduled for release this year. These aren’t stretch targets. They’re tracked, funded, and moving forward with presale capital that’s already raised. Bitcoin Solaris isn’t a theory or a bet on potential. It’s a network already distributing tokens, already rewarding users, and still sitting at just $8 per token. The $20 listing target gives new buyers immediate upside. But the real value is in getting in before BTC-S becomes harder to earn — and more expensive to buy.

As rumors spread about the possible use of XRP in America’s national financial reserve, Morgan calls the idea unfounded and unlikely. No it won’t. https://t.co/48zQvTBUg9 — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 21, 2025 No, the Government Won’t Seize XRP Escrow Rumors started circulating after online influencers suggested that the U.S. could tap into Ripple’s XRP escrow as part of a broader crypto reserve strategy. Some went as far as claiming this would support the country’s financial system in the digital age. Bill Morgan, however, made it clear—“No, it won’t.” He dismissed the speculation outright, denying any government plan to take control of the XRP escrow held by Ripple. RUMOR: Whispers from D.C. suggest something massive — U.S. authorities are exploring whether Ripple’s $XRP escrow could be repurposed as part of America’s national financial reserves.

XRP… pic.twitter.com/SQsyeo5gBz — Paul White Gold Eagle (@PaulGoldEagle) June 20, 2025 His comment comes amid growing buzz on X, where crypto analysts like John Squire and Pumpius have floated the theory that the U.S. might explore XRP’s utility for reserve backing. While some compare the possibility to the once-unlikely approval of Bitcoin ETFs , Morgan isn’t buying it. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP Prices are Down Today? , Fed Payment Rumors Add Fuel At the same time, new posts have emerged claiming that the U.S. Federal Reserve is already using XRP via its FedNow payment system. One viral post insisted that XRP use is “100% confirmed.” But this appears to stretch the facts. Volante Technologies, a partner in the FedNow pilot, has integrated Ripple tech for cross-border payments. Still, there’s no verified indication that XRP itself is being used by the Fed for transactions. Why Now? These rumors gained more attention following Ripple’s release of 1 billion XRP from escrow in early June. Split across three large transactions, the tokens were valued at over $2.2 billion. Combined with recent discussions around a potential U.S. strategic crypto reserve , including altcoins like XRP and SOL, the speculation has only intensified. Despite XRP’s growing presence in global payments infrastructure, there’s no concrete evidence to support claims of its seizure or inclusion in the U.S. reserve. For now, they remain speculative at best. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Ripple’s XRP escrow is a mechanism designed to manage the circulating supply of XRP. Ripple locked up 55 billion XRP in 2017, releasing 1 billion monthly, with most being re-locked to prevent market shocks and ensure stability. How does Ripple’s escrow mechanism work, and what legal or technical barriers exist to government intervention? The XRP Ledger’s built-in protocol governs the time-locked escrow, making it technically difficult for direct external seizure. Legally, any government intervention would face significant challenges given the decentralized nature of crypto and potential property rights issues. How does the ongoing Ripple-SEC case affect the regulatory landscape for XRP and similar digital assets? The Ripple-SEC case, which largely determined XRP is not a security for programmatic sales, has brought some regulatory clarity. Its resolution could set precedents for how other digital assets are classified and regulated in the U.S., influencing future enforcement and legislation.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-news-ripple-lawyer-bill-morgan-slams-u-s-escrow-seizure-rumors/,"ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|SOL|XRP","News|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

2025-06-21T10:00:00,"Analysts split on Bitcoin as altcoins AERO and KAIA outperform broader market","Bitcoin bulls held the line at a key support level this week, resulting in sideways price action as markets digested a flurry of macro developments. Despite Bitcoin’s stability, the broader crypto market slipped over 2% to $3.37 trillion by Friday. Most of the losses were concentrated in Bitcoin, while the altcoin sector defied the downtrend, climbing approximately 3.2% in total market value. Sentiment gradually weakened through the week, barring a brief midweek uptick. By Friday, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index had slipped to 48, hovering at the lower end of neutral territory as traders remained cautious of volatility. Why is Bitcoin stuck? Bitcoin remained confined within a narrow range between $103,645 and $108,771 this week, as mounting macroeconomic and geopolitical pressures kept traders on the sidelines. Early week tension between Iran and Israel dampened risk appetite, limiting price action despite occasional intraday rallies. By Friday, BTC had edged up 1.1% to $106,081, but this modest gain followed three days of stagnation between $104,000 and $105,000. The Juneteenth holiday pause in U.S. markets further contributed to the lack of momentum, with S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures dipping roughly 0.3% ahead of the reopening. A key overhang remains the escalation risk in the Middle East. Although President Trump’s two-week deadline before making a military decision against Iran has temporarily eased fears of immediate escalation, the geopolitical backdrop continues to inject uncertainty into markets. According to Exness strategist Christopher Tahir, traders may remain risk-averse until clarity emerges on both the geopolitical and monetary policy fronts. Adding to this is the Federal Reserve’s decision to hold interest rates steady, a move largely priced in by markets. However, the revised dot plot, with just four cuts in total over the next three years , down from six in previous forecasts, carried a hawkish undertone that could continue to dampen risk appetite in the near term. On-chain data is also showing signs of buyer exhaustion. According to CryptoQuant, short-term Bitcoin holders, those who entered the market in recent months, have reduced their holdings by roughly 800,000 BTC since late May, a drop of 15.1%. CryptoQuant’s demand momentum indicator, which tracks changes in held balances across participant cohorts, has dropped by 2 million BTC, marking its lowest recorded level. Net spot inflows remain positive but have slowed considerably, with just 118,000 BTC added over the past 30 days compared to 228,000 BTC in May. Both are signs that the market lacks retail participation. Whale accumulation rates have also declined, falling to 1.7% per month from 3.9% previously. Activity in U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs has moderated, with daily net inflows dropping from 9,700 BTC in April to around 3,300 BTC. Combined, this tapering from both retail and institutional segments suggests that the recent equilibrium in Bitcoin’s price is less about strength and more about the absence of directional conviction. Will Bitcoin go back up? Volatility remained elevated heading into the weekend, driven in part by the expiry of $6.8 trillion worth of options tied to stock indexes, ETFs, futures, and individual equities across traditional markets. According to The Kobeissi Letter and SpotGamma, this is potentially the largest triple witching OpEx event ever recorded, and the first such post-holiday expiry in over two decades. Traders had widely anticipated heightened volatility, and Bitcoin’s sudden move late Friday appeared to reflect this build-up. Expectations heading into the session were sharply divided. A poll by analyst Matthew Hyland showed market sentiment nearly split, with 50.2% predicting a drop to $94,000, and 49.8% expecting a rally to $114,000. That divergence reflected broader uncertainty, as Bitcoin briefly surged to $106,500 before reversing course sharply. The brief upside rally cleared out nearby short positions, but the subsequent sell-off triggered a long liquidation cascade, confirming the fragility of leverage-driven rallies in the current environment. Coinglass’s 24-hour liquidation heatmap captured this move in real time. The surge through $106,000 swept through multiple clusters of ask-side liquidity, followed by a steep rejection that liquidated longs stacked between $105,000 and $106,500. Binance BTC/USDT 24-hour liquidation heatmap. Source: CoinGlass. BTC is now consolidating between liquidity-rich zones, with $105,000 and $102,000 acting as short-term magnet levels that could draw price action depending on broader flows. One of the more optimistic voices in the market is Ted Pillows, who recently outlined a Wyckoff accumulation setup developing on Bitcoin’s daily chart. “A breakout above $110,000,” he wrote, “and BTC will rally towards $130K in no time.” BTC/USDC 1-day chart. Source: Ted Pillows According to his chart, Bitcoin has progressed through the latter stages of the Wyckoff cycle, forming a Sign of Strength (SOS) and consolidating around what he labels the Last Point of Support (LPS). A move above resistance would confirm entry into the markup phase, where bullish momentum typically accelerates. Another relatively optimistic outlook comes from market commentator Coinvo, who focuses on Bitcoin’s macro structure. Their analysis tied current price action to long-term trendlines stretching back to 2017 and 2021, suggesting that BTC remains within its historical logarithmic growth channel. Coinvo @ByCoinvo · Follow If everything goes according to plan, $BTC could go to $290,000 by the end of 2025! 👀 10:30 PM · Jun 19, 2025 647 Reply Copy link Read 43 replies Even so, not all analysts are convinced the worst is behind. Justin Bennett offered a more cautious read of recent price action, arguing that the rejection near $106,000 may have trapped late buyers. He warned that a break below local trendline support could drag BTC toward the $101,000 to $99,000 region. Some analysts were watching key technical indicators for signs of weakness. Ether Wizz, for instance, flagged the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) as a critical level. Since May, this moving average has served as a reliable support zone. BTC/USDT 1-day trading chart. Source: Ether Wizz While bulls managed to defend it again this week, a decisive break below could accelerate a correction toward $98,000. Still, with geopolitical tensions cooling and macro conditions showing early signs of stabilisation, the environment may begin shifting back in favour of risk assets. For Bitcoin, that could mean another attempt to reclaim higher ground, provided buyers step in with conviction. At the time of writing, Bitcoin had erased all of its weekly gains and was trading at $104,216, marking a modest 1.2% loss over the past seven days during late Asian trading hours on June 20. Altcoin market Over the past week, the altcoin market saw a burst of momentum early on, with total market capitalisation climbing 7.2% to reach $1.34 trillion by June 17. However, the rally lost steam in the days that followed, with the market cooling to $1.29 trillion and closing the week with a net gain of 3.2%. Despite the positive headline figure, broader altcoin performance showed signs of fading strength. The Altcoin Season Index dropped to 20 at press time, suggesting that most of the top 100 altcoins are now underperforming relative to Bitcoin. Ethereum, the largest altcoin by market cap, fell 2.2% over the past week as its price fell below $2,500 while its market cap was set at a little above $300 billion. Other large-cap altcoins such as Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and Hyperliquid (HYPE) experienced steeper losses of 2.6%, 6.2%, 8.4%, and 13.7%, respectively, while Tron (TRX) managed to see slight gains in the period. Aerodrome Finance (AERO) stood as the leading gainer of the week, holding on to gains of 32.3% while Kaia (KAIA) and Sei (SEI) posted gains of 22.4% and 17.9% respectively. Source: CoinMarketCap. AERO’s price gains came after Coinbase announced the integration of Base-based DEXs into its main app, potentially exposing Aerodrome to over 10.8 million monthly users and boosting its trading volume and revenue. The token also gained from JPMorgan’s launch of its JPMD deposit token on Base, a move that is accelerating institutional flows into the Base DeFi ecosystem and could drive higher TVL and trading flows to Aerodrome, which currently ranks among the largest liquidity hubs on the network. Kaia’s rally this week was driven by a number of bullish developments. First, USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin by market cap, was launched on the Kaia network this week. Second, Kaia announced plans to launch a Korean won-backed stablecoin in a bid to support South Korea’s push to establish a solid stablecoin economy to counter offshore alternatives. Kaia also became the first Layer‑1 blockchain to onboard the Japan Blockchain Association this week, which added to bullish momentum. As for Sei (SEI), the token gains followed the announcement that the Wyoming Stable Token Commission selected it as one of two candidate blockchains for the state-backed WYST stablecoin. Most decentralised applications on Sei, including Yei Finance and Takara Lend, have also recorded increased adoption in recent weeks.

2025-06-21T09:58:47,"Norway Considers Temporary Ban on Crypto Mining to Address Energy Strain","The Norwegian government is weighing a temporary ban on cryptocurrency mining, citing concerns over electricity consumption, network capacity, and land use. In a notice issued Friday, officials announced that a formal investigation will be conducted in the autumn to evaluate the potential impact of mining operations. The outcome could lead to a temporary halt on such activities, aimed at redirecting resources toward more essential public and industrial needs. The potential ban would be under Norway’s Planning and Building Act, a legislative tool that allows the government to allocate energy usage and infrastructure. “It is uncertain how big a problem crypto mining will become in Norway in the future,” the government said, adding that newly introduced data center regulations requiring registration will help clarify the scope and footprint of crypto-related facilities. Rising Electricity Costs Norwegian households, like many across Europe, have seen a sharp increase in electricity prices over the past two years, largely driven by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent disruption in oil and gas supplies. This has added urgency to national efforts to prioritize energy allocation and limit non-essential power consumption . Local communities have also voiced frustrations over the noise generated by crypto mining farms, with several petitions calling for shutdowns of such operations. While mining may bring in revenue and investment, many argue it offers little social benefit and places an unnecessary burden on already strained infrastructure. Norway to Ban Mining? Norway’s proposal echoes similar moves in other regions. Earlier this year, Russia imposed mining bans across 10 regions to prevent power outages and reduce energy stress. China, once the global leader in Bitcoin mining, implemented a blanket ban in 2021, pushing many miners to relocate to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions like Texas in the United States. Despite ongoing environmental concerns, crypto mining remains legal across most of the U.S., where it continues to contribute significantly to the global Bitcoin hashrate. Lawmakers have raised questions about sustainability, but regulatory action has been sporadic and state-specific. For now, Norway’s move signals a growing shift among European nations toward reevaluating the energy-intensive nature of crypto mining.

2025-06-21T09:48:56,"Bitcoin Falls Below $104K as Retail Investor Sentiment Returns to Liberation Day Levels","Bitcoin (BTC) BTC continues to struggle for direction amid mounting macroeconomic pressures and a notable deterioration in retail investor sentiment. The asset is hovering near $103,700 following a volatile 24-hour stretch, in which it briefly dropped below $103,400 before staging a modest recovery, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. This price behavior reflects an uneasy market backdrop, shaped by both geopolitical tensions and uncertain monetary policy. According to an X post by crypto analytics firm Santiment on Thursday, sentiment among retail investors has turned sharply negative. The firm reported that the ratio of bullish to bearish commentary has fallen to just 1.03 to 1 — the lowest since early April, when the President Donald Trump unveiled his so-called Liberation Day tariffs, triggering peak market fear at the time. Santiment emphasized that this current wave of retail pessimism is unusually intense and, based on past patterns, may mark a contrarian signal for a price rebound. They specifically noted that back in April, Bitcoin rallied shortly after similar fear levels surfaced, suggesting large investors often use periods of retail capitulation to accumulate at favorable prices. Adding to the pressure is the Federal Reserve's recent decision to hold interest rates steady, which has kept btcoin trading in a relatively tight $100,000 to $110,000 range over the past month. Meanwhile, on-chain metrics show declining open interest on Binance, pointing to continued deleveraging among derivatives traders. At the same time, whale wallets have shown steady accumulation since 2023 — an indication that large holders are continuing to build their positions despite the short-term uncertainty. Technical Analysis Highlights BTC-USD traded in a 24-hour range between $106,552.98 and $102,411.01, a 3.89% swing as volatility spiked midday. A sharp drop occurred between 14:00 and 17:00 UTC, pushing price below $104,000 and forming strong resistance near $106,000 on above-average volume. Support emerged between $103,000 and $103,500, where price consolidated on declining volume during the final eight hours of the analysis period. A V-shaped rebound developed late in the session, with BTC rising from $103,363 to $103,618 and establishing a local floor near $103,500. Short-term momentum indicators showed mild recovery as the session closed near intraday highs, but follow-through remained limited.

2025-06-21T09:45:00,"LATAM crypto news: Bit2Me targets Latin American expansion, Paraguay fights Bitcoin extortions","Latin America’s crypto scene continues to evolve, with new products and regional expansions highlighting its rapid growth. This week’s most notable news is that Bit2Me, one of Spain’s biggest crypto exchanges, is planning to expand operations in Latin America. Paraguay, on the other hand, has announced a new effort to combat Bitcoin-based hacking and extortion as the country’s cryptocurrency sector expands. Bit2Me targets Latin American expansion Bit2Me, a renowned cryptocurrency exchange in Spain, has announced plans to expand into Latin America as part of its global growth strategy. The company plans to raise revenue from $24 million in 2024 to $26 million in 2025 through a combination of global expansion and strategic relationships with local banks in major markets such as Argentina, Peru, Brazil, and Mexico. Bit2Me is also planning to reach additional European markets such as Portugal, Italy, and France, aided by its efforts to secure the MiCA license. With over 1.2 million members and €3 billion in transaction volume in 2024, Bit2Me is focusing on compliance and advanced security measures, cementing its position as one of Spain’s most secure exchanges. Cyber attacks surge in Paraguay Paraguay has recently become a common target of cyberattacks, with hackers frequently demanding Bitcoin as a sort of ransom. These attacks, which include the theft of sensitive data and ransomware campaigns, have targeted both public and commercial organisations. The hacking of President Santiago Peña’s official Twitter account resulted in a false announcement about Bitcoin legalisation, causing alarm. Although the account was immediately restored, the breach exposed the country’s digital weaknesses and the growing complexity of cyber attacks. In response to these growing risks, Paraguay implemented the National Cybersecurity Strategy 2025-2028. Gustavo Villate, Minister of Information and Communication Technologies, spearheads the plan, which focuses on critical infrastructure protection, cybersecurity training, and international cooperation. The Armed Forces are also playing an important part in the implementation. The strategy intends to make Paraguay’s digital ecosystem more secure by decreasing human error and strengthening institutional resilience. However, its success is dependent on excellent execution and collaboration with allies such as the United States, Israel, and Taiwan. Brazil’s B3 exchange launches Ethereum and Solana futures B3, Brazil’s biggest stock exchange, announced futures contracts for Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) on Monday, boosting its portfolio of regulated cryptoassets as demand for blockchain-based financial products grows. The new derivatives represent a significant step for B3, which has been progressively establishing a regulated crypto market ecosystem in Latin America’s largest economy. The contracts will be priced in US dollars and reference the Nasdaq Ether and Nasdaq Solana Reference Prices.

2025-06-21T09:41:27,"Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will WLD Price Reach $10?","The post Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will WLD Price Reach $10? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights The live price of the WLD token is $ 0.00349731 Price predictions for 2025 range from $1.10 to $4.18. Long-term forecasts suggest potential highs of $35.60 by 2030. Worldcoin made waves in early 2024 when its token WLD nearly hit $12, but since then, it has struggled to break past key resistance levels, even during bullish market events. With price action losing steam and investor interest fading, many wonder if the project is losing its shine. As it is backed by Sam Altman and focused on decentralized identity, Worldcoin is quietly building in the background. working hard in silence, maybe with the ongoing AI crypto bull run gaining momentum, Sam Altman’s brainchild, Worldcoin, could possibly create a significant buzz. As AI narratives gain traction, many are intrigued to know, “What does the future hold for Worldcoin?” or “Could WLD stage a comeback?” Let’s delve into the anticipated Worldcoin price predictions for 2025 to 2030 and the years to come Table of contents Overview CoinPedia’s WLD Price Prediction Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025 WLD Price Forecast 2026 – 2030 Worldcoin Price Forecast 2026 WLD Price Prediction 202 7 Worldcoin Price Forecast 2028 WLD AI Token Price Forecast 2029 Worldcoin AI Token Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency WorldCoin WDC Token WDC Price $ 0.00349731 -10.28% Market Cap $ 0.00 Circulating Supply 0.00 Trading Volume $ 5.1958 All-time High $11.82 on 10th March 2024 All-time Low $0.9758 on 13th September 2023 CoinPedia’s WLD Price Prediction As per Coinpedia’s Worldcoin Price Prediction, marketers’ optimism and the involvement of high-profile figures could significantly boost Worldcoin’s potential value. Further, this credibility and backing, combined with a potential increase in trading volume, could drive the price of WLD Coin to an impressive $5.89 by the end of 2025. If the market faces external pressures, then it could potentially drive the price down to a low of $1.61 . Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2025 1.61 3.25 5.89 Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025 The Q2 2025 price action for Worldcoin (WLD) clearly showed signs of exhaustion before it could push higher. Despite recent optimism, its inability to establish a sustained, long-term bullish trend remains evident. Looking at its historical performance, the recent Q2’s gains appear modest, like a mere bucket of water from a deep well. Since early 2024, WLD is still down over 80% from its highs, even with the latest price surge. The entire weekly price action on the Binance exchange resembles a converging price action structure in a falling channel. This pattern occurrence highlights the odds of future good returns remaining high. When a catalyst activates, it will shoot a breakout from this range. Many are now asking: What could truly push Worldcoin higher? As seen time and again in the crypto space, social sentiment is often the key driver. Renewed marketing efforts and the involvement of high-profile figures could significantly enhance Worldcoin’s value. If, in the coming sessions, optimistic momentum builds up, then WLD must achieve a Change of Character (ChoCh) in its current price structure by breaking above the $2.12 level in June or July. Once this level is cleared and a ChoCh is confirmed, Worldcoin could break out of its bearish pattern and potentially retest the $4.18 level by the end of 2025. However, if WLD fails to maintain a bullish trajectory this year, its price could drop as low as $0.70.

2025-06-21T09:32:13,"Bitcoin Demand Momentum Shows Bears Are Giving Up – Price Reversal Ahead?","The post Bitcoin Demand Momentum Shows Bears Are Giving Up – Price Reversal Ahead? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News June 21, 2025 – Bitcoin might be gearing up for a massive breakout—and it’s not just about technical patterns or ETF news this time. A sharp shift in demand momentum and rising Global Liquidity Index (GLI) has caught the eye of veteran analyst Crypto Rover. Let’s break down what the latest signals are telling us. Bears Are Backing Off, Bulls Taking Over According to a chart shared by Crypto Rover, Bitcoin’s demand momentum has plunged deep into negative territory. In simple words, short-term sellers are pulling back, while long-term holders are stepping in. Historically, this kind of shift tends to happen near market bottoms, often just before big price rallies. The bears are capitulating. Bitcoin demand momentum is deep in the red. A reversal is imminent! pic.twitter.com/3Nf0GmTJDH — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) June 21, 2025 At the same time, Bitcoin’s trading volume jumped 20% in the past 24 hours, reaching $47 billion. The spike in volume reflects a mix of panic selling and opportunistic buying, a classic sign of bear capitulation. Adding to the bullish signs, major players are placing bold bets. One whale, in particular, is holding a massive 20x long position on Bitcoin , valued at over $364.35 million, reflecting a growing confidence in BTC. Liquidity and Bitcoin in Sync Interestingly, Rover also compared recent Bitcoin’s price to global liquidity trends. Historically, when global liquidity rises, Bitcoin tends to follow suit, sometimes with explosive results. Notably, the current Global Liquidity Index (GLI) level mirrors the period when Bitcoin was trading around $100,000, implying that if the pattern holds, Bitcoin could soon revisit or even surpass this price point. Bitcoin will explode. Just like the global liquidity did.

Volume Trends: Sustained high trading volumes could confirm that the capitulation phase is ending, signaling that selling pressure is subsiding. Support Levels: The $103,400 level remains a critical support zone. Holding above this threshold is essential for a bullish reversal. Technical Indicators: Watch for bullish crossovers in the MACD and RSI moving out of oversold territory, currently at 45 . As of now, Bitcoin is trading around $103.693, reflecting a drop of 2.2% seen in the last 24 hours, with a market cap hitting $2.06 trillion. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-21T09:30:53,"Norway Weighs Temporary Ban on Crypto Mining to Conserve Energy","Norway is exploring the possibility of imposing a temporary ban on cryptocurrency mining operations as part of a broader effort to safeguard national energy resources and improve the allocation of electricity. The country’s government announced Friday that it will conduct a detailed investigation this autumn to evaluate the impact of crypto mining on power consumption and local infrastructure. This process could ultimately lead to a temporary halt in mining operations. Officials cited the Planning and Building Act, a national legal framework that enables the government to control energy use and zoning policies, as the basis for such an action. “It is uncertain how big a problem crypto mining will become in Norway in the future,” the government said in a statement. They added that new regulations requiring registration of data centers involved in mining would provide authorities with greater insight into the scale and scope of the industry. Rising Energy Demands Prompt Policy Review The proposal comes amid growing energy concerns across Europe. Many residents in Norway have experienced significant increases in electricity costs, a trend exacerbated by the ongoing war in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russian oil and gas supplies. Local communities have also raised objections to crypto mining facilities due to noise pollution and their impact on residential life. In response to these pressures, some Norwegian regions have already begun pushing for tighter regulations or outright shutdowns of such operations. A Broader Pattern of Global Crackdowns Norway’s deliberation reflects a growing international trend. Countries around the world are becoming increasingly wary of the environmental and energy consequences of crypto mining. Russia, for example, enacted a ban on mining in ten regions earlier this year in an effort to prevent blackouts and lower electricity usage. In China, a sweeping nationwide ban introduced in 2021 forced miners to migrate their operations to other jurisdictions, including parts of the United States. Despite environmental concerns and public scrutiny, crypto mining remains legal across most U.S. states, making the country one of the leading contributors to the global Bitcoin hashrate. However, voices within the U.S. political landscape have continued to criticize the industry’s environmental footprint, fueling calls for greater regulatory oversight. Energy Policy and Environmental Impact Under Scrutiny For Norway, the challenge lies in balancing its goals for digital innovation and energy conservation. As the country continues to support a digital economy, policymakers appear to be reevaluating how much power can be devoted to non-essential or highly energy-intensive sectors like crypto mining. The government emphasized that the upcoming investigation will help it make data-driven decisions regarding the sustainability and scale of mining activities. While no immediate bans have been enforced, the potential for such measures signals a growing readiness to act if crypto mining begins to overwhelm Norway’s power grid or interfere with long-term environmental goals.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/norway-weighs-temporary-ban-on-crypto-mining-to-conserve-energy/,"ASIA|BTC|COMMODITY|MINING|REGULATION","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare
2025-06-21T09:30:17,"XRP Price Crash Tests Critical Support At $2.1, Will It Break?","After the market crash that sent the Bitcoin price falling toward $100,000, the XRP price also saw a notable decline, and this crash has brought it toward an important level. While the digital asset continues to hold above the $2.1 level, it remains critical support and a break below this could be negative for the price. This is outlined by crypto analyst The Alchemist Trader, who has shown what direction the XRP price could be headed in depending on what happens here. XRP Price Threatens Major Support Level After the almost 4.5% decline that ravaged the XRP price over the last week, it has been pushed down toward the next major support level, lying just above $2.09. So far, the bulls have defended this level, but the multiple tests suggest that a breakdown at this level could be in view. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts 20% Ethereum Price Crash Below $2,000, Here’s Why The analyst explains that the reason this level is so important is that it actually includes the value area low recorded in previous declines. Additionally, it is the 200-day moving average (MA) for the cryptocurrency, and also now serves as a key daily support/resistance flip. This means either camp of the bulls and bears can pull it in their direction, making it incredibly important for what happens to the XRP price in the short term. Given the importance of this level, whether it holds or breaks will carry serious implications for the XRP price. In the bearish scenario, the crypto analyst explains that a break below this support would trigger a liquidity sweep as the price dumps lower. The possibility of a break is even higher now, given that this level has already been tested multiple times. The Alchemist explains that each test weakens the level, putting it at risk of a breakdown. However, with long consolidation so far above this level, there is a bullish scenario that is rising. As bulls continue to maintain this support, further strength here could erode the possibility of a decline. If properly defended with a notable uptick in volume, in addition to a move upward into the recent local highs at $2.4, then it is likely that the XRP price continues to move up. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Wave Towards ATH Coming? Here Are The Targets “For bulls, a clean defense of this level with volume and a move back above recent local highs would indicate a potential rotation toward the next resistance,” the analysis read. “For bears, a breakdown without a reclaim increases the likelihood of continuation to the downside.” As for how to play the current trend, the analyst advises investors to exercise caution and wait for confirmation before taking positions. The confirmation here would either be a break below the support or a strong upward rally away from it, signaling a clear direction.

2025-06-21T09:15:50,"Litecoin, XRP and Solana ETF Applications Have 95% Chance of Approval This Year: Bloomberg Analysts","Litecoin ( LTC ), XRP and Solana ( SOL ) exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications all have overwhelming odds of approval this year, according to Bloomberg ETF analysts. James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas now say on the social media platform X that those three altcoins have a 95% chance of securing ETFs in 2025. They also give potential Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Cardano ( ADA ), Polkadot ( DOT ), Hedera ( HBAR ) and Avalanche ( AVAX ) ETFs a 90% chance of approval. A Sui ( SUI ) ETF application from the crypto asset manager Canary Capital has slightly lower odds, at 60%, and a Canary Tron ( TRX ) bid doesn’t have any chance in 2025, according to the analysts. Source: James Seyffart/X Seyffart also notes that Ethereum ( ETH ) staking ETFs are also “extremely likely” to be approved in 2025. Numerous other ETF applications have been filed for potential funds based on Axelar ( AXL ), BNB , Aptos ( APT ), Chainlink ( LINK ), Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ), Official Trump ( TRUMP ), Melania ( MELANIA ) and Bonk ( BONK ). Other potential new ETFs are tied to a basket of currencies, and a few are based on Bitcoin ( BTC ) and/or Ethereum, assets that have already been approved for inclusion in other spot ETFs. The SEC greenlit the first spot market Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, bringing in billions of dollars worth of inflows to the top digital asset by market cap. The regulator subsequently approved Ethereum ETFs for trading last July.

2025-06-21T09:08:55,"Bitcoin’s plunge triggered $495 million in liquidations","Bitcoin (BTC) plummeted to its lowest point this week, triggering almost half a billion worth of liquidations and rattling the crypto market as geopolitical tensions and heavy selling pressure spooked traders. The BTC price slipped back to the $102k zone before regaining the crucial $103k mark. The global digital assets market cap dropped by 2% over the past 24 hours to stand at $3.2 trillion. Its 24-hour trading volume surged by 40% to hit $112 billion, suggesting that traders are moving their funds quickly amid surging uncertainties. However, the fear and greed index flashes “neutral” sentiment among the investors. Liquidations soar to $500M The day that began with Bitcoin hitting $106K saw it dropping below $103,000 in a matter of hours. The pullback wasn’t limited to BTC as Ethereum (ETH) plunged by as much as 4.5% in just a couple of hours. ETH price fell to a low of $2,375 as its trading volumes spiked by 89% to hit $22 billion. Ether is trading at an average price of $2,425 with a marginal recovery. Solana, Cardano, and the biggest meme crypto, Dogecoin, were also swept up in the selloff. Their price dropped between 3% and 5% during the same session. Meanwhile, Sei has turned out to be the biggest gainer among the top 100 crypto. Sei price is up by 10% in the last 24 hours and is trading around $0.22 at press time. The sell-off has triggered widespread liquidations across the crypto derivatives market. CoinGlass data shows that 127k traders got liquidated over the last 24 hours, as the liquidations went on to hit $495 million. The single largest liquidation order of BTC/USD valued at $8 million happened on Bybit. Source: CoinGlass Around $413 million worth of liquidated positions (84%) turn out to be long bets. This suggests that traders were hoping that bullish momentum would continue ahead, but the cumulative crypto market printed red indexes. Ethereum liquidations outpaced Bitcoin’s, totaling $177 million compared to Bitcoin’s $122 million. Bitcoin is trading at an average price of $103,485 at press time, which traders have been watching closely for a while. Its 24-hour trading volume is up by 34% to stand at $48.8 billion. Bitcoin’s overheating zone cleared? According to CryptoQuant data , the heatmap chart tells the story that the $103K liquidation cluster, which previously acted as a concentration point for overleveraged long positions, was completely dismantled. As Bitcoin broke through this key level, a sharp wick pushed prices below $102,500, flushing out traders who had entered long positions with insufficient margin or poor risk management. Binance’s liquidation delta chart corroborates this move, showing a pronounced spike of over $160 million in long liquidations within minutes of the breakdown. Simultaneously, Binance’s Net Taker Volume, smoothed over a seven-hour moving average. It plunged deeply into negative territory, hitting nearly negative $100 million. It’s the third time this month the metric has nosedived to such extremes. The metric showed that the sell-off may have felt brutal in the moment, but events like these can ultimately be constructive. Aggressive liquidations and deep negative taker volumes typically signal that speculative excess has been flushed from the system. It suggests that the removal of weak-handed leverage can make the way for more stable price action.

Key Takeaways: CoinMarketCap was hacked after a fake wallet verification popup appeared on its site, triggering phishing concerns. MetaMask and Phantom flagged the site as unsafe, warning users against connecting wallets. The breach has revived criticism of CoinMarketCap’s security, nearly four years after its major data leak. The phishing-style notification asked users to connect their wallets and approve ERC-20 token access, raising immediate red flags across the crypto community. Wallet providers like MetaMask and Phantom quickly flagged the site as unsafe, with Phantom displaying a browser warning against using the platform. CoinMarketCap Removes Malicious Popup In a Friday post on X , CoinMarketCap confirmed the removal of the malicious popup. “We’ve identified and removed the malicious code from our site,” the platform said. The company added that it is continuing to investigate the breach and is reinforcing its security measures to prevent similar incidents. Update: We've identified and removed the malicious code from our site. Our team is continuing to investigate and taking steps to strengthen our security. — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) June 21, 2025 The malicious prompt, which triggered warnings from wallet providers like MetaMask and Phantom, reportedly asked users to connect their wallets and approve access to ERC-20 tokens. Phantom’s browser extension even flagged CoinMarketCap as “unsafe to use,” raising concerns about the platform’s vulnerability. Reports of the phishing attempt began circulating across crypto social media, with several users alerting others not to interact with the prompt. Many suspected the attack was an attempt to steal wallet credentials through a fake interface mimicking a legitimate verification process. The incident has reignited concerns about CoinMarketCap’s security, coming nearly four years after a 2021 data breach exposed the email addresses of over 3.1 million users. That data was later discovered for sale on hacking forums, prompting criticism over the platform’s safeguards.

Users are urged to avoid connecting wallets to unsolicited prompts and to verify all interactions through official channels. The company has not disclosed the source of the breach but has committed to ongoing security reviews. Crypto Crime Turns Violent as Illicit Transactions Top $40B in 2024 Illicit cryptocurrency activity surged to at least $40.9 billion in 2024, according to Chainalysis, with the number likely to grow as more criminal-linked wallets are identified. Hacks alone accounted for $2.2 billion in stolen assets, a 21% increase from the previous year. North Korean-linked groups, including Lazarus and Tradetraitor, were behind over 60% of those thefts, with major incidents like the $300 million hack of Japan’s DMM Bitcoin exchange among their hits. But the threats go beyond online exploits. Criminal groups are using crypto to fund and conceal a wider range of crimes—from investment scams and AI-enhanced romance frauds to drug trafficking and even physical violence. In one alarming case on May 13, 2025, the daughter and grandson of Paymium’s CEO were nearly kidnapped in Paris by masked men.

The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Bitcoin: Pioneering a New Era of Digital Currency Bitcoin, often dubbed the world's first cryptocurrency, has revolutionized the way we think about money. Introduced by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, it offers a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that operates without a central authority. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin isn't printed or minted; it's a digital asset maintained by a distributed network of computers called nodes. Transactions are verified by miners through a process of solving complex puzzles, ensuring the integrity and security of the network. This innovative system removes the need for intermediaries like banks, making transactions faster and potentially more secure. As we navigate the current market cycle, Bitcoin's potential continues to spark interest. The network undergoes a ""halving"" approximately every four years, reducing the reward for miners by half. This process, designed to cap the total supply at 21 million bitcoins, can influence the network's stability and mining profitability. Compared to newer cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin remains the most established and widely recognized. Its limited supply and increasing adoption suggest a resilient future, though the market remains volatile. Whether Bitcoin is an attractive option now depends on individual perspectives, but its pioneering technology and growing role in the financial world are hard to ignore. ADA Coin: Cardano's Green Revolution in the Crypto World Cardano is shaking up the cryptocurrency scene. It's a platform built for smart contracts, making it easy to create apps, tokens, and games without middlemen. Its coin, ADA, competes with Ethereum's ETH. With ADA, users can store value, make payments, and help secure the network by staking. What makes Cardano special is its eco-friendly approach. It uses proof-of-stake, which is much more energy-efficient than the methods used by many other cryptocurrencies. In today's market, ADA shows great promise. Cardano's technology allows fast transactions, potentially handling up to a million per second. This speed comes from its unique two-layer system, separating transactions from smart contracts. Since 2021, Cardano's native tokens have made interactions with smart contracts safer and cheaper. As the crypto world moves towards sustainability and efficiency, ADA stands out. It's an attractive option for those interested in the future of cryptocurrency. Monero: Your Money, Your Business Monero (XMR) was launched in 2014 with a clear goal: to let people make private transactions. While many think Bitcoin hides their identity, it's actually easy to trace payments back because blockchains are open for all to see. Monero changes this by using advanced cryptography to hide both the sender and the receiver. The team behind Monero puts privacy and security first. They want everyone to have protection, no matter how tech-savvy they are. Monero aims to let payments happen quickly and cheaply, without fear of censorship. In a world where digital footprints are everywhere, Monero offers a way to keep your financial dealings to yourself. This makes it stand out from other cryptocurrencies that are less private. With growing concerns about data privacy, Monero's technology has big potential. In the current market, where regulations are tightening, a coin like Monero could become more attractive. It provides a level of anonymity that others don't. As more people seek privacy, Monero might see increased interest compared to more transparent coins. Chainlink: Bridging Blockchains with the Real World Chainlink is changing how smart contracts work. It connects them to real-world data, like prices and events. This makes them more useful and powerful. Chainlink uses a network of oracles to fetch and verify data. These oracles have a reputation score to ensure the data is accurate. The system combines on-chain and off-chain processes. On-chain, it manages data requests. Off-chain, it gathers the data. The LINK token powers this ecosystem. It rewards those who provide data and keeps the network secure through staking. In the current market, Chainlink stands out. Its ability to connect blockchains with external data fills a crucial gap. As more decentralized apps emerge, the need for reliable data grows. Unlike some coins that offer limited utility, LINK has a clear purpose. Its technology is mature compared to newer projects. With the increasing focus on DeFi and real-world asset tokenization, Chainlink's role becomes even more important. Investing in LINK could be attractive for those looking at long-term growth in the crypto space. Conclusion BTC, ADA, XMR, and LINK are strong options, but XYZVerse ($XYZ) stands out as the first sports memecoin, aiming for 20,000% growth with its unique blend of memes and sports.

2025-06-21T08:52:02,"Bitcoin Price Slides to $103K as Major Altcoins Crash (Weekend Watch)","The broader cryptocurrency market continues struggling amid mounting geopolitical and economic pressures. Bitcoin’s price has lost almost 3% on the day, while major altcoins such as Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and others chart even more considerable declines. Bitcoin Price Tumbles toward $103K Bitcoin is charting a near 3% loss in the past 24 hours in what seems to be a broader crypto market selloff. As seen in the chart below, the price tumbled from around $106,000 to an intraday low at $102,400 before bouncing and settling at where it current trades at the time of this writing. Source: TradingView As CryptoPotato reported, however, the common theme amongst the majority of cryptocurrency analysts and experts is that Bitcoin’s price trading at around $100,000 is indicative of institutional dominance and not retail FOMO. This suggests that it has much more staying power because institutions are a lot less likely to sell during temporary and sudden drawdowns like the current one. At the same time, however, the war between Israel and Iran continues , driving oil prices up and causing turmoil on stock markets as well. Altcoins Crash Harder than BTC The heatmap below paints a clear picture: most of the altcoins are trading in the red and are charting consiedrable losses. Namely, some of the larger-cap cryptocurrencies such as ETH, SOL, ADA, DOGE, HYPE, BCH, LINK, AVAX, and more, are declining for more than 3% during the past 24 hours. Interestingly enough, Bitcoin’s dominance – the metric, which tracks its share relative to that of the rest of the market is up by more than 1% during the same period. This shows that BTC is performing a lot better and altcoins are completely unable to capitalize on its drawdown. In fact, this seems to be the other theme of the current cycle.

2025-06-21T08:45:58,"Hedera Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will HBAR Price Hit $0.5?","The post Hedera Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will HBAR Price Hit $0.5? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights The live price of Hedera crypto is $ 0.14594094 . Hedera Price prediction highlights HBAR could reach $0.750 by the end of 2025 if bullish trends continue. The Long-term forecasts suggest HBAR could hit $2.20 by 2030, indicating stable growth potential. Hedera has been making waves in the crypto space, having entered the top 20 digital assets by market cap in 2024, and now eyeing a potential leap into the top 10 by the end of 2025. With increasing real-world use cases, institutional interest, and strategic partnerships, many are closely tracking HBAR price prediction 2025 to gauge how high the token can rise. With major companies like Google, IBM, and Chainlink Labs backing the project, and talks of an HBAR ETF approval, many are asking: Will HBAR Price Hit $1? Table of Contents Story Highlights Overview Hedera Price Projection 2025 HBAR Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 HBAR Price Prediction 2026 HBAR Price Forecast 2027 Hedera Price Forecast 2028 HBAR Price Target 2029 Hedera Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis Coinpedia’s Hedera Price Prediction FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency.

All-time low. $0.01001 (January 2nd, 2020). Hedera Price Projection 2025 Since peaking at $0.40 in mid-January 2025, the HBAR price has been on a steady decline. External factors dragged it into a falling wedge pattern, reaching a low of $0.125 in early April. However, from the second week of April, a broader crypto rally lifted HBAR as well. It broke out of the wedge, rebounding from a strong support zone, the same area that fueled the Q4 2024 rally. This zone, confirmed by the FRVP indicator, showed high buying interest and supported a sharp rebound. HBAR surged nearly 80%, climbing from $0.125 to $0.228 in April to mid-May. But the momentum didn’t hold. Over the last 40 days, HBAR dropped around 35%, with 21% of that loss occurring in just 10 days. Currently, HBAR is forming another falling wedge with its price trading near its lower boundary, and inching to retest the high-demand zone again. If bulls regain strength, at this zone, then in June or July, HBAR could retest the $0.19 resistance area. A breakout above this resistance area could follow, potentially reaching $0.27 in the upcoming Q3. Looking further ahead, a daily close above $0.27 could open the path to $0.40. If momentum continues, HBAR might even touch $0.75 by year-end. On the downside, failure to hold support may push the price down toward $0.072. Meanwhile, internal developments tell a different story. Hedera’s ecosystem continues to grow. In 2025, it launched its first native hardware wallet, Citadel , and an AI-based tool, the Hedera Agent Kit , making token creation more accessible. Another major project, HashSphere, is due in Q3 2025. It aims to offer a private, regulated blockchain for stablecoin-based payments and asset management. To streamline operations, Hedera also rebranded key entities on May 15. The HBAR Foundation is now the “Hedera Foundation,” and the Governing Council is the “Hedera Council.” In short, while external pressures weigh on price, Hedera’s internal progress remains strong. If macro conditions improve, 2025 could still bring a major turnaround.

2025-06-21T08:23:19,"Cardano’s Treasury Strategy Targets Bitcoin DeFi Boom","The post Cardano’s Treasury Strategy Targets Bitcoin DeFi Boom appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Cardano is making strategic moves to strengthen its DeFi ecosystem, backed by solid fundamentals and community support. With its treasury holding around 1.7 billion ADA, founder Charles Hoskinson has laid out plans to convert a portion into stablecoins to fuel liquidity and long-term growth. However this new proposal has ignited discussion in the Cardano ecosystem , suggesting a strategic deployment of the blockchain’s billion-dollar treasury to bring in both Bitcoin and stablecoin liquidity. Andrew Throuvalas, a researcher and Bitcoin advocate, believes Cardano is uniquely positioned to lead the next phase of Bitcoin DeFi, and the moment to act is now. CARDANO TREASURY DEBATE: BITCOIN AND STABLECOINS Here's my perspective as a Bitcoiner who a) has a majority BTC position, and b) wants to put it into DeFi. Cardano community should ABSOLUTELY deploy treasury funds toward intelligent efforts to bring both BTC and… pic.twitter.com/hWWaVtydew — Andrew | BitcoinOS (@AThrouvalas) June 20, 2025 Meanwhile, Cardano adoption is rising fast, with 110 million transactions and 22 billion ADA staked across 3,000 pools, showing strong community and growing DeFi activity. Built for Bitcoin DeFi but Missing Liquidity Cardano’s architecture shares key similarities with Bitcoin, and its DeFi infrastructure has proven secure and reliable over time. Projects like BitcoinOS and Charms are laying the foundation for bridgeless Bitcoin integration on Cardano, which could support what Throuvalas describes as a $2 trillion DeFi opportunity for Bitcoin. Loopholes? However, two major gaps remain. Cardano currently lacks deep stablecoin liquidity, making it difficult for institutions or large holders to operate at scale without experiencing slippage. In addition, competing ecosystems such as Arbitrum are rapidly building towards similar goals, while Cardano’s unique advantages remain underappreciated by the broader crypto market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Crash Coming! Altcoins to Drop 50–80%, Bitcoin to Face 45% Crash , Stablecoin Pools and BTC Incentives Proposed To close this gap, Throuvalas proposes allocating treasury funds to leading Cardano protocols such as Minswap, Liqwid Finance, and Indigo Protocol. By building large stablecoin pools, these platforms could offer Bitcoin holders the ability to borrow against their BTC more effectively, a critical use case for Bitcoin DeFi participants. He further suggests converting a portion of the ADA treasury into Bitcoin and using it to pay out yield directly in BTC. This would reward users who bring their Bitcoin to the Cardano network. As a precedent, Babylon has already attracted more than $4.5 billion in BTC with similar mechanisms, even though yields are paid in tokens rather than Bitcoin itself. A Timely Opportunity for Cardano Throuvalas believes this approach could significantly boost activity on Cardano and establish it as a long-term hub for Bitcoin DeFi. With its secure infrastructure and untapped treasury, the network could capture lasting value and demand for ADA if it moves quickly to attract Bitcoin liquidity. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

While the intent is to boost liquidity, converting a large ADA amount could create short-term selling pressure. However, proponents argue the market is deep enough to absorb it without significant price impact. What are the potential risks of converting ADA into stablecoins and Bitcoin now? Risks include potential short-term price volatility for ADA due to sales, and the stablecoin market itself carries inherent volatility and regulatory risks. It could also signal a lack of confidence in ADA’s long-term value to some. Could this move attract institutional investors, and if so, what additional infrastructure or compliance measures would be needed? Yes, increased stablecoin and Bitcoin liquidity could attract institutions. This would require robust institutional-grade compliance, security, and potentially tailored financial products like tokenized real-world assets.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/cardanos-treasury-strategy-targets-bitcoin-defi-boom/,"ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION","News|Altcoins",cryptocompare
2025-06-21T08:23:03,"Exploring the Next Wave of Potential Crypto Millionaires by December 2025","As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, certain digital tokens stand out for their potential to generate significant financial returns by December 2025. This article explores a range of coins, including meme tokens and established cryptocurrencies, that are poised for potential growth. Introduction to $XYZ: The Meme Coin Making Waves The crypto community has been buzzing about $XYZ, a meme coin that made an impressive debut by raising $14 million in its early stages. The meme coin, known for its rapid value increase from $0.0001 to $0.003333 during the presale, is now preparing for further growth. Its next target price is $0.005 in the upcoming presale stage. Once the presale concludes, $XYZ is slated for listing on both centralized and decentralized exchanges, promising more exposure and potentially higher value. The community around $XYZ is characterized by its dynamic and engaging nature, promising substantial rewards and incentives. These aspects are crucial for those looking to invest in the potential next big meme coin. Bitcoin: The Stalwart of Digital Currency Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, continues to be a robust choice for investors. It operates on a decentralized network, free from the confines of traditional financial institutions. Bitcoin's innovative technology and its scheduled ""halvings"" contribute to its appeal by potentially increasing its scarcity and value over time. Cardano (ADA): Pioneering Eco-Friendly Blockchain Solutions Cardano stands out in the crypto market with its proof-of-stake mechanism, which not only enhances transaction efficiency but also reduces environmental impact. ADA, Cardano's native token, is crucial for both network security through staking and as a means for transaction and smart contract facilitation. Monero: Championing Privacy Monero offers enhanced privacy, allowing users to conduct transactions without traces. This focus on security and anonymity is increasingly important in a digital age where privacy concerns are escalating. Chainlink: The Link Between Blockchains and Real-World Data Chainlink facilitates the integration of external data into blockchain networks, a critical feature for the functionality of smart contracts. This capability makes LINK an essential part of the growing decentralized finance sector. Conclusion Investing in cryptocurrencies like BTC, ADA, XMR, LINK, and particularly $XYZ could potentially position investors for significant gains by 2025. As the market continues to evolve, these coins have shown promise in terms of growth and technological innovation.
