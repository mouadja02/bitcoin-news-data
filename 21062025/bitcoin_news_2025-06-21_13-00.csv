2025-06-21T10:48:28,"Raoul Pal says the current crypto cycle is like 2017","Crypto research platform Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal has said the current crypto cycle is very similar to the one that was witnessed in 2017. According to Pal, Bitcoin posted a steady uptrend all through the year before skyrocketing towards the end of the year. The Real Vision CEO gave his verdict via a video, where he said, “It’s spookily similar to 2017.” Pal also said he is beginning to see a longer crypto cycle, forecasting that it might take a while this time around given the business cycle score. The business cycle score, according to Pal, is a macroeconomic model he uses to track the position of the global economy in the broader cycle. He added that it is still below 50 and it generally “takes a while to climb up.” Raoul Pal sees similarities in the current and 2017 crypto market cycle According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin started trading around $1,044 at the beginning of 2017, before rising to around $2,187 by May 31. The premier digital asset went on to close the year at $14,156, signifying a massive rise of 1,255% from the price at the beginning of the year. While Pal predicts the same movement, he acknowledges that a weaker US dollar could indicate a slower crypto cycle, which means it will take time before it reaches its peak. “With the dollar breaking down even today, it’s starting to suggest this may go into Q2 2026,” he said. Since the beginning of the year, the US Dollar Index has been down 8.995, sitting at 98.77 at the time of writing, according to data from TradingView. Bitcoin and DXY are inversely correlated. This means that when the dollar weakens, Bitcoin becomes more attractive not just as a speculative investment but as an alternative currency. Pal also added that macroeconomic data has been a primary reason why the crypto cycle has always shifted further back. “It’s like the whole cycle got shifted cause rates didn’t get adjusted; the dollar was sideways for some time,” he said. He also said that the current market may show signs of looking like the market in 2020 more than the one in 2021, suggesting that it could be at an earlier growth phase than many are predicting. Bitcoin began 2020 at $7,174, but dropped by 27% in March to $5,227. The asset then rebounded 129% to hit $11,990 in August, before witnessing a 304% increase, ending the year at $28,993. Pal added that the market needs to continue expanding to attract big players. He discussed his recent trip to the Middle East where he met with Sovereign Wealth Funds, adding that most of them were bullish on crypto. “The mandate across the entire region, from Saudi to Abu Dhabi to Dubai to Bahrain to Qatar, is AI and blockchain,” he said. He also added that things should evolve past just seeing Bitcoin as a reserve asset, noting that nations need to start building their entire government infrastructure on blockchain. Global governments have been making moves in the crypto sector since the beginning of the year. A typical example is Pakistan, with the country looking for ways to create a draft bill that could be passed in the near future to regulate digital assets. In addition, the country plans to formulate regulations that will protect its investors and attract global players into its digital asset hub. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-06-21T10:44:16,"Best Crypto to Soar 1000x as Dogecoin, XRP, and Solana ETFs May Go Live Soon","More crypto spot ETFs are a near certainty, according to analysts, which means we may see Dogecoin, Solana, and XRP approved by the end of 2025. James Seyffart joined the hype to announce that the approval odds for the spot crypto ETFs just went above 90%. This comes just two days after Bloomberg analyst, Eric Balchunas, posted about ETFs racking in over $68B in just five days. These developments come in the context of spot Bitcoin ETFs managing over $100B in assets, further reinforcing the idea that 2025 will be the ETF year. So, it was only a matter of time until Ethereum made its move as well. Ethereum ETF Speculation Fuels Solana and XRP’s Chart Race Ethereum’s Open Interest on futures contracts surged by 21% between June 9 and June 11, hitting an annual record of $41.43B. This is an indicator that investors are using borrowed funds to speculate on $ETH’s future price movements. Ethereum’s ETF momentum has injected hype into Solana and XRP, in the context of both being at the intersection of adoption and pro-regulation. While the chart difference isn’t necessarily mindblowing, as both Solana and XRP are still in the red, they’re currently on an upward trajectory over the past week. Part of that is undoubtedly linked to Ethereum’s performance, which brings us to the next point: most best altcoins today might experience chart growth as well during this period. Here are three next crypto that could hit 1000x and that you should keep on your radar. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana’s Layer 2 Solution Promising Faster Transactions and Lower Network Costs Solaxy ($SOLX) is Solana’s upcoming Layer 2 upgrade that aims to fix Solana’s core issue: network congestion. In turn, this would allow for infinite scalability, faster transactions, and, more importantly, lower network fees. This is possible thanks to Solaxy’s off-chain execution and parallel processing, drastically reducing network latency and offering near-instant finality. $SOLX has just completed its presale run, accumulating over $56M with a price of $0.001766. If you’ve missed the presale, though, don’t worry, there’s still time to capitalize on $SOLX’s presale price. You have two days left until the token lists on public platforms, during which $SOLX is still available to purchase at its presale price. Solaxy is a meme coin with real blockchain utility that promises to upgrade Solana’s performance drastically in 2025 and beyond. This is the main reason why our analysts predict a price point for $SOLX of $0.032 by the end of 2025 . This would translate into an ROI of 1,712% if you invest today. Long-term, $SOLX’s performance should catch even more steam, reaching up to $0.2 or higher in 2026, for an ROI of 11,225% (or 113x). These predictions are based on $SOLX’s stated utility, the presale’s performance, and the idea that Solaxy will experience growing adoption and successful implementation post-launch. So, if you don’t want to miss this two-day window, go to Solaxy’s presale page and buy your $SOLX today. 2. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Solana Bot Sniping Hot Tokens on Telegram Snorter Token ($SNORT) is the presale of the coming Solana bot that snipes hot tokens for you on Telegram. Snorter Bot is the solution to manual coin hunting, which comes with problems like missed opportunities, the requirement for extensive tech knowledge, and the risk of running into pump-and-dumps, rug pulls, and honeypots. The Bot centralizes its entire activity in the Telegram chat, which translates to: No more juggling different wallets and browser extensions Higher comfort thanks to having everything in one place Real-time hot token alerts via the Telegram chat Snorter Bot comes with multiple tools to make your life, as a coin hunter, easier, such as the custom automated sniping, fast and secure swaps on the private Solana RPC infrastructure, and honeypot and scam protection. Snorter Token is in presale since May 2025, and has accumulated over $1.1M so far, with a token price of $0.0959. The project combines the coin’s meme potential with real-world utility, which is why we predict $SNORT to go as high as $0.94 in 2025 . This makes for a growth of 880%. Long-term, with widespread adoption and successful implementation, the token could step into wealth-building territory by 2030, with a chart price of $3.25, for an ROI of 3,236% if you invest at today’s price. In simpler words, a $100 investment in today’s $SNORT could reward you with $3,336 in less than five years; pure passive income. If you want to join the presale, go to $SNORT’s presale page, buy your tokens today , and consider joining the staking pool for the juicy 273% APY. 3. Ethereum ($ETH) – The Time Has Come to Embrace $ETH Ethereum ($ETH) has been on the rough side of the market for quite a while, but times are changing and now may be the time to buy. While the recent interest into Ethereum’s ETF performance dominates the headlines, let’s not also forget about Vitalik Buterin’s prediction that Ethereum’s Layer 1 could scale by up to 10x in 2026. The news didn’t impact $ETH’s performance in the charts, but we believe Ethereum may be cooking something. $ETH is still not in the green in the charts, but its downside seems to have slowed down. This could be a buy signal, considering the recent developments and Buterin’s promise of a 10x Layer 1 in 2026. Especially if we consider the 81% positive community sentiment and the 44% increase in the daily trading volume . Could the Coming Dogecoin and XRP EFTs Rally the Crypto Market? All signs point to the fact that, indeed, the crypto market may witness a sustained rally once ETFs get approved. Solaxy ($SOLX) and Snorter Token ($SNORT) are some of the best presales to 1000x as XRP and Dogecoin ETFs should launch in the coming months, potentially sounding the FOMO alarm. Don’t take this as financial advice.

2025-06-21T10:43:02,"South Korea’s First Bitcoin Treasury Firm Emerges with $18.5M Acquisition Deal","The post South Korea’s First Bitcoin Treasury Firm Emerges with $18.5M Acquisition Deal appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin treasury strategy is booming. Public companies now hold over 777,000 BTC—worth nearly $80.6 billion—and South Korea is jumping in. Parataxis Holdings has officially announced plans to create South Korea’s first publicly traded Bitcoin treasury company, signaling a bold shift in corporate crypto adoption across Asia. Parataxis Acquires Bridge Bio to Launch BTC Treasury Arm In a strategic move, Parataxis Holdings will acquire a controlling stake in biotech firm Bridge Bio for $18.5 million, according to the latest reports. After the acquisition, Bridge Bio will be renamed Parataxis Korea and will function as a Bitcoin-focused treasury company. The company confirmed the plan via press release , marking a historic first for South Korea. Inspired by MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Playbook Parataxis is following the path blazed by MicroStrategy , the most prominent public company holding Bitcoin. The firm, led by Michael Saylor, holds 592,100 BTC—valued at over $61.4 billion. Parataxis partner Andrew Kim revealed that the move is inspired by success stories like MicroStrategy and Asia’s Metaplanet, which holds 10,000 BTC. Kim emphasized Bitcoin’s long-term potential for shareholders and national economic value. Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Gains Steam in Korea Despite South Korea’s strict crypto regulations —such as the ban on spot Bitcoin ETFs —momentum for corporate adoption is building: A 2025 pilot program allows 3,500 companies to open verified crypto accounts. Lawmakers are pushing for spot crypto ETFs and won-backed stablecoins by next year. Parataxis CEO Edward Chin said the Bitcoin strategy is designed to benefit both investors and the nation. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Demand Momentum Shows Bears Are Giving Up – Price Reversal Ahead? , Top Public Companies Holding Bitcoin Here are the top public companies by BTC holdings: MicroStrategy – 592,100 BTC (~$61.4B) Marathon Digital – 16,930 BTC Riot Platforms – 8,872 BTC Metaplanet (Japan) – 10,000 BTC Boyaa Interactive (Hong Kong) and DDC Enterprise (China) also hold significant Bitcoin reserves.

Is South Korea a crypto-friendly country? South Korea has a complex crypto stance. While exchanges are legal and there’s growing public and political interest in crypto, strict regulations exist, including past bans on spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, recent developments show increasing corporate adoption and discussions around easing some rules. How much is crypto tax in South Korea? South Korea plans to implement a 22% capital gains tax on crypto profits exceeding KRW 2.5 million (approx. $1,900) starting in 2025 (though it has been subject to delays).

2025-06-21T10:30:29,"Spot Crypto ETF Approval: Analyst Predicts Massive 90%+ Chance","BitcoinWorld Spot Crypto ETF Approval: Analyst Predicts Massive 90%+ Chance Exciting news is circulating in the cryptocurrency world, suggesting that a significant breakthrough for mainstream adoption might be just around the corner. A prominent voice in financial analysis has weighed in on the likelihood of a spot crypto ETF finally making its way to market, and their outlook is overwhelmingly positive. This development could pave the way for easier access to digital assets for both institutional and retail investors. What Are the Current ETF Approval Odds ? According to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart , the chances of seeing most spot crypto ETF applications receive the green light are remarkably high. Seyffart recently took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to share his analysis, asserting a confidence level exceeding 90% for the approval of these products. This figure represents a significant shift in sentiment compared to past years when such approvals seemed like a distant possibility. The analyst’s assessment provides a strong indicator of the growing maturity of the crypto market and the increasing inevitability of regulated investment products. Why Is Increased Communication with the SEC Approval a Positive Sign? A key factor contributing to Seyffart’s optimistic forecast is the noticeable increase in communication between asset managers applying for the ETFs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Historically, the SEC has been cautious, citing concerns around market manipulation, investor protection, and the nascent nature of the crypto markets. However, the recent engagement suggests a more constructive dialogue is taking place. This enhanced communication indicates that the SEC may be actively working through the concerns and technical details necessary for approving these complex financial products. It signals progress towards finding common ground and establishing the necessary regulatory frameworks. Navigating the Path to Crypto ETF Approval The journey towards crypto ETF approval in the United States has been a long and often frustrating one. While futures-based Bitcoin ETFs have been approved and are trading, a spot ETF, which holds the underlying asset directly, has remained elusive. Many believe a spot ETF offers a more direct and potentially less complex investment vehicle for investors. The SEC’s previous rejections have often centered on surveillance-sharing agreements and concerns about the unregulated nature of underlying crypto exchanges. The increased communication noted by James Seyffart likely involves addressing these specific regulatory hurdles and establishing robust investor safeguards. Insights from James Seyffart on Timing While the probability of approval is high, the exact timing remains uncertain, according to James Seyffart . He stated, “Could be something we’re talking about in the next month or two. Or it could be something that waits until October or later. Matter of when not if.” This perspective suggests that while the regulatory wheels are turning, the process still involves significant steps and potential delays. Investors and market participants should prepare for potential outcomes ranging from near-term approvals to those happening later in the year. The focus, as Seyffart highlights, should be on the strong likelihood of approval rather than fixating on a precise date. Understanding the Potential Impact of a Spot Crypto ETF The approval of a spot crypto ETF is widely seen as a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency market. Here are some potential impacts: Increased Institutional Investment: ETFs provide a familiar, regulated, and easily accessible structure for large financial institutions, pension funds, and wealth managers to gain exposure to crypto without directly holding the assets. Enhanced Retail Access: Investing in crypto through a traditional brokerage account via an ETF is simpler for many retail investors than setting up crypto exchange accounts and managing private keys. Market Legitimacy: Regulatory approval from the SEC lends significant credibility to the crypto asset class, potentially attracting more conservative investors. Potential Price Impact: Increased demand from new investor classes could positively impact the price of the underlying cryptocurrencies. Improved Liquidity: A successful ETF can add significant trading volume and liquidity to the market. However, potential challenges exist, including market volatility, concentration risk in specific assets, and the influence of large fund flows on price dynamics. Conclusion: High Probability, Uncertain Timeline The analysis shared by Bloomberg’s James Seyffart offers a compelling outlook for the future of cryptocurrency investments. The assertion of a 90%+ chance for widespread crypto ETF approval , driven by improved dialogue with the SEC, paints a picture of regulatory acceptance becoming a reality. While the specific timeline for these approvals remains fluid, the message is clear: it appears to be a question of ‘when,’ not ‘if.’ This development holds the potential to unlock significant new capital and mainstream participation in the crypto market, marking a pivotal moment for the industry.

2025-06-21T10:23:59,"Crypto Dip As Trump Says Iran’s Leader An ‘Easy Target’ But This DeFi Token Is Defying Odds","The post Crypto Dip As Trump Says Iran’s Leader An ‘Easy Target’ But This DeFi Token Is Defying Odds appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is reeling after President Donald Trump’s provocative claim that Iran’s leader is an “easy target,” sparking a sharp decline in major coins. Bitcoin dropped from $104,310 to $103,553 within an hour, while Ether and XRP fell 1.3% each. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index slid to “Neutral,” reflecting shaken investor confidence. Geopolitical tensions, intensified by recent Israel-Iran clashes, fuel this uncertainty. Yet, amidst this turmoil, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is defying odds, drawing attention as a promising defi crypto. Its presale, now in phase 5, has raised $10,900,000, with over 560 million tokens sold to 12,300 holders. Investors are flocking to this rising star. Bitcoin’s Stumble Amid Tensions Trump’s bold statement on Truth Social, hinting at Iran’s supreme leader’s vulnerability, sent shockwaves through crypto prices. Bitcoin, hovering above $105,000, briefly dipped below $104,000 before recovering slightly. Analysts warn it may test the $100,000 mark soon, with some predicting a drop to $93,000. The crypto fear and greed index, now at 52, signals caution among traders. This isn’t Trump’s first market jolt; his tariff policies earlier in 2025 also rattled investors.

2025-06-21T10:23:58,"Crypto Bull Run Alert: Altcoins Set for 10x to 20x Gains in Q3","The post Crypto Bull Run Alert: Altcoins Set for 10x to 20x Gains in Q3 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The entire crypto market is tumbling under rising geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty, pulling its valuation down to $3.2 trillion with a modest 1.10% dip in the past day. A sudden 42% spike in trading volume hints at panic moves, while the Fear & Greed Index sits at 43, marking a neutral but uneasy mood. Bitcoin is trading at $103,491, down 0.94% with a daily low of $102,372. Moreover, a 38% spike in volume to $50.25B signals heavy trading, but not clear bullish momentum. Despite the bearish clouds, a popular analyst, Nathan from Investing Made Simple, says the Bitcoin bull market is far from done, and the best is yet to come. In his latest video , he laid out three distinct models that all point to one target: a parabolic move to $200,000 or more by the end of 2025. Three Data-Backed Models Point $200K Target The analyst first broke down Bitcoin’s historical cycle returns, noting that after every bear market low, BTC typically experiences exponential growth . From the 2022 bottom of $15,500, a 10–15x return places the top somewhere between $140,000 and $210,000, in line with previous cycles, though slightly more conservative due to market maturity. The second method used Bitcoin’s last all-time high of $69,000 as a baseline, applying the common bull market pattern of 2–3x gains from that peak. Again, this results in a target range of $140,000 to $210,000. Finally, he introduced the Power Law Model, which tracks Bitcoin’s price trajectory against time using logarithmic growth. This model not only suggests a peak around $210,000 but also forecasts the final blow-off phase to occur between October and December 2025, similar to what we’ve seen in past cycles. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Demand Momentum Shows Bears Are Giving Up – Price Reversal Ahead? , Altcoins Could See Explosive Gains in Q3 While Bitcoin price may grab the headlines, the analyst emphasized that altcoins could be the real winners in the final leg of the bull market. Historically, the last quarter of a cycle, when Bitcoin enters its parabolic phase, is when altcoins truly explode, often outperforming BTC by several multiples. The analyst also hinted that top-tier altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche could deliver massive returns, especially if money flows from Bitcoin into more speculative assets, as it typically does near cycle tops. Even mid- and low-cap coins could rally 10x to 20x, but the analyst warns this phase is usually short-lived, sometimes lasting just a few weeks. He added that timing will be key, and investors sitting on the sidelines too long may miss out on the most profitable window of the entire cycle. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-21T10:04:21,"Bitcoin Solaris: The $8 Token Set to Explode Like Early Bitcoin – Crypto Presale Already Raised $5 Million","The post Bitcoin Solaris: The $8 Token Set to Explode Like Early Bitcoin – Crypto Presale Already Raised $5 Million appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin’s first wave of gains went to early participants — the ones mining and moving BTC before it hit headlines. Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche followed similar patterns. The biggest returns always came before exposure, while networks were still small and tokens were still affordable. Bitcoin Solaris is in that phase right now. The presale is live at $8 per token. More than $5 million has already been raised by over 11,500 wallets. The projected listing price is $20 — locking in a 150% gain before a single exchange opens. But the difference here isn’t just timing. It’s function. BTC-S already powers products that reward users daily, with token velocity, live mining, and an expanding reward economy. Daily Rewards, Real Token Flow At the center of the Bitcoin Solaris economy is Nova — the mobile mining app that lets users earn BTC-S directly from their phones. It’s not a wrapped service or outsourced cloud pool. The system measures real usage and distributes token rewards based on device contribution, with no capital lockup or staking period required. Early beta testers out-earned some of the largest staking platforms, all without buying rigs or running wallets 24/7. The app is in active rollout, with more users onboarded as presale expands. BTC-S also moves through the Bitcoin Solaris Casino — an on-chain reward engine that distributes tokens daily. All verified users get one free spin per day, with instant payout chances. Buyers who hit specific spending tiers unlock larger reward pools, including up to 0.5 BTC in bonuses. The spin logic is automated and smart contract-driven — no centralized draw, no delayed credits. These systems keep BTC-S circulating before it even hits public markets. That flow drives demand, creates winners daily, and reinforces the core value loop that’s already running. Presale at $8, Capped Supply, and No Inflation Only 4.2 million BTC-S tokens are available in the presale. The total supply is capped at 21 million — forever. There are no future emissions, no inflation schedules, and no hidden unlocks waiting to dilute value. What’s being sold now is the only public supply until listings. At $8, the token is still priced under 40% of its projected launch value. With active products already distributing BTC-S and more utilities on the way, the price is still trailing the value. Every user participating now is ahead of both the listing and the demand wave that comes with it. The opportunity isn’t just in scarcity — it’s in position. This is the phase where utility already works, but market access hasn’t priced it in yet. Audited, Verified, and Already Covered by Analysts BTC-S isn’t just delivering functionality — it’s doing it transparently. The core contracts have been audited by Cyberscope . The Nova App’s mining logic was independently reviewed by Freshcoins . And the dev team has completed KYC verification to back investor safety. In a recent breakdown, Token Empire called Bitcoin Solaris the only project under $10 where rewards are moving, products are active, and upside hasn’t been locked out. Product Momentum Is Pushing Value Forward BTC-S isn’t sitting in wallets. It’s circulating. Between Nova and the Casino, tokens are moving daily, creating reward loops that continue to grow as new users join in. The next expansion is the Mining Power Marketplace — a live-use platform that lets users monetize unused processing power or rent capacity using BTC-S. The feature is already in development and ties directly into the network’s value cycle. Wallet upgrades, testnet deployment, and developer tools are all scheduled for release this year. These aren’t stretch targets. They’re tracked, funded, and moving forward with presale capital that’s already raised. Bitcoin Solaris isn’t a theory or a bet on potential. It’s a network already distributing tokens, already rewarding users, and still sitting at just $8 per token. The $20 listing target gives new buyers immediate upside. But the real value is in getting in before BTC-S becomes harder to earn — and more expensive to buy.

While some compare the possibility to the once-unlikely approval of Bitcoin ETFs , Morgan isn’t buying it. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP Prices are Down Today? , Fed Payment Rumors Add Fuel At the same time, new posts have emerged claiming that the U.S. Federal Reserve is already using XRP via its FedNow payment system. One viral post insisted that XRP use is “100% confirmed.” But this appears to stretch the facts. Volante Technologies, a partner in the FedNow pilot, has integrated Ripple tech for cross-border payments. Still, there’s no verified indication that XRP itself is being used by the Fed for transactions. Why Now? These rumors gained more attention following Ripple’s release of 1 billion XRP from escrow in early June. Split across three large transactions, the tokens were valued at over $2.2 billion. Combined with recent discussions around a potential U.S. strategic crypto reserve , including altcoins like XRP and SOL, the speculation has only intensified. Despite XRP’s growing presence in global payments infrastructure, there’s no concrete evidence to support claims of its seizure or inclusion in the U.S. reserve. For now, they remain speculative at best. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Ripple’s XRP escrow is a mechanism designed to manage the circulating supply of XRP. Ripple locked up 55 billion XRP in 2017, releasing 1 billion monthly, with most being re-locked to prevent market shocks and ensure stability. How does Ripple’s escrow mechanism work, and what legal or technical barriers exist to government intervention? The XRP Ledger’s built-in protocol governs the time-locked escrow, making it technically difficult for direct external seizure. Legally, any government intervention would face significant challenges given the decentralized nature of crypto and potential property rights issues. How does the ongoing Ripple-SEC case affect the regulatory landscape for XRP and similar digital assets? The Ripple-SEC case, which largely determined XRP is not a security for programmatic sales, has brought some regulatory clarity. Its resolution could set precedents for how other digital assets are classified and regulated in the U.S., influencing future enforcement and legislation.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-news-ripple-lawyer-bill-morgan-slams-u-s-escrow-seizure-rumors/,"ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|SOL|XRP","News|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

2025-06-21T10:00:00,"Analysts split on Bitcoin as altcoins AERO and KAIA outperform broader market","Bitcoin bulls held the line at a key support level this week, resulting in sideways price action as markets digested a flurry of macro developments. Despite Bitcoin’s stability, the broader crypto market slipped over 2% to $3.37 trillion by Friday. Most of the losses were concentrated in Bitcoin, while the altcoin sector defied the downtrend, climbing approximately 3.2% in total market value. Sentiment gradually weakened through the week, barring a brief midweek uptick. By Friday, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index had slipped to 48, hovering at the lower end of neutral territory as traders remained cautious of volatility. Why is Bitcoin stuck? Bitcoin remained confined within a narrow range between $103,645 and $108,771 this week, as mounting macroeconomic and geopolitical pressures kept traders on the sidelines. Early week tension between Iran and Israel dampened risk appetite, limiting price action despite occasional intraday rallies. By Friday, BTC had edged up 1.1% to $106,081, but this modest gain followed three days of stagnation between $104,000 and $105,000. The Juneteenth holiday pause in U.S. markets further contributed to the lack of momentum, with S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures dipping roughly 0.3% ahead of the reopening. A key overhang remains the escalation risk in the Middle East. Although President Trump’s two-week deadline before making a military decision against Iran has temporarily eased fears of immediate escalation, the geopolitical backdrop continues to inject uncertainty into markets. According to Exness strategist Christopher Tahir, traders may remain risk-averse until clarity emerges on both the geopolitical and monetary policy fronts. Adding to this is the Federal Reserve’s decision to hold interest rates steady, a move largely priced in by markets. However, the revised dot plot, with just four cuts in total over the next three years , down from six in previous forecasts, carried a hawkish undertone that could continue to dampen risk appetite in the near term. On-chain data is also showing signs of buyer exhaustion. According to CryptoQuant, short-term Bitcoin holders, those who entered the market in recent months, have reduced their holdings by roughly 800,000 BTC since late May, a drop of 15.1%. CryptoQuant’s demand momentum indicator, which tracks changes in held balances across participant cohorts, has dropped by 2 million BTC, marking its lowest recorded level. Net spot inflows remain positive but have slowed considerably, with just 118,000 BTC added over the past 30 days compared to 228,000 BTC in May. Both are signs that the market lacks retail participation. Whale accumulation rates have also declined, falling to 1.7% per month from 3.9% previously. Activity in U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs has moderated, with daily net inflows dropping from 9,700 BTC in April to around 3,300 BTC. Combined, this tapering from both retail and institutional segments suggests that the recent equilibrium in Bitcoin’s price is less about strength and more about the absence of directional conviction. Will Bitcoin go back up? Volatility remained elevated heading into the weekend, driven in part by the expiry of $6.8 trillion worth of options tied to stock indexes, ETFs, futures, and individual equities across traditional markets. According to The Kobeissi Letter and SpotGamma, this is potentially the largest triple witching OpEx event ever recorded, and the first such post-holiday expiry in over two decades. Traders had widely anticipated heightened volatility, and Bitcoin’s sudden move late Friday appeared to reflect this build-up. Expectations heading into the session were sharply divided. A poll by analyst Matthew Hyland showed market sentiment nearly split, with 50.2% predicting a drop to $94,000, and 49.8% expecting a rally to $114,000. That divergence reflected broader uncertainty, as Bitcoin briefly surged to $106,500 before reversing course sharply. The brief upside rally cleared out nearby short positions, but the subsequent sell-off triggered a long liquidation cascade, confirming the fragility of leverage-driven rallies in the current environment. Coinglass’s 24-hour liquidation heatmap captured this move in real time. The surge through $106,000 swept through multiple clusters of ask-side liquidity, followed by a steep rejection that liquidated longs stacked between $105,000 and $106,500. Binance BTC/USDT 24-hour liquidation heatmap. Source: CoinGlass. BTC is now consolidating between liquidity-rich zones, with $105,000 and $102,000 acting as short-term magnet levels that could draw price action depending on broader flows. One of the more optimistic voices in the market is Ted Pillows, who recently outlined a Wyckoff accumulation setup developing on Bitcoin’s daily chart. “A breakout above $110,000,” he wrote, “and BTC will rally towards $130K in no time.” BTC/USDC 1-day chart. Source: Ted Pillows According to his chart, Bitcoin has progressed through the latter stages of the Wyckoff cycle, forming a Sign of Strength (SOS) and consolidating around what he labels the Last Point of Support (LPS). A move above resistance would confirm entry into the markup phase, where bullish momentum typically accelerates. Another relatively optimistic outlook comes from market commentator Coinvo, who focuses on Bitcoin’s macro structure. Their analysis tied current price action to long-term trendlines stretching back to 2017 and 2021, suggesting that BTC remains within its historical logarithmic growth channel. Coinvo @ByCoinvo · Follow If everything goes according to plan, $BTC could go to $290,000 by the end of 2025! 👀 10:30 PM · Jun 19, 2025 647 Reply Copy link Read 43 replies Even so, not all analysts are convinced the worst is behind. Justin Bennett offered a more cautious read of recent price action, arguing that the rejection near $106,000 may have trapped late buyers. He warned that a break below local trendline support could drag BTC toward the $101,000 to $99,000 region. Some analysts were watching key technical indicators for signs of weakness. Ether Wizz, for instance, flagged the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) as a critical level. Since May, this moving average has served as a reliable support zone. BTC/USDT 1-day trading chart. Source: Ether Wizz While bulls managed to defend it again this week, a decisive break below could accelerate a correction toward $98,000. Still, with geopolitical tensions cooling and macro conditions showing early signs of stabilisation, the environment may begin shifting back in favour of risk assets. For Bitcoin, that could mean another attempt to reclaim higher ground, provided buyers step in with conviction. At the time of writing, Bitcoin had erased all of its weekly gains and was trading at $104,216, marking a modest 1.2% loss over the past seven days during late Asian trading hours on June 20. Altcoin market Over the past week, the altcoin market saw a burst of momentum early on, with total market capitalisation climbing 7.2% to reach $1.34 trillion by June 17. However, the rally lost steam in the days that followed, with the market cooling to $1.29 trillion and closing the week with a net gain of 3.2%. Despite the positive headline figure, broader altcoin performance showed signs of fading strength. The Altcoin Season Index dropped to 20 at press time, suggesting that most of the top 100 altcoins are now underperforming relative to Bitcoin. Ethereum, the largest altcoin by market cap, fell 2.2% over the past week as its price fell below $2,500 while its market cap was set at a little above $300 billion. Other large-cap altcoins such as Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and Hyperliquid (HYPE) experienced steeper losses of 2.6%, 6.2%, 8.4%, and 13.7%, respectively, while Tron (TRX) managed to see slight gains in the period. Aerodrome Finance (AERO) stood as the leading gainer of the week, holding on to gains of 32.3% while Kaia (KAIA) and Sei (SEI) posted gains of 22.4% and 17.9% respectively. Source: CoinMarketCap. AERO’s price gains came after Coinbase announced the integration of Base-based DEXs into its main app, potentially exposing Aerodrome to over 10.8 million monthly users and boosting its trading volume and revenue. The token also gained from JPMorgan’s launch of its JPMD deposit token on Base, a move that is accelerating institutional flows into the Base DeFi ecosystem and could drive higher TVL and trading flows to Aerodrome, which currently ranks among the largest liquidity hubs on the network. Kaia’s rally this week was driven by a number of bullish developments. First, USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin by market cap, was launched on the Kaia network this week. Second, Kaia announced plans to launch a Korean won-backed stablecoin in a bid to support South Korea’s push to establish a solid stablecoin economy to counter offshore alternatives. Kaia also became the first Layer‑1 blockchain to onboard the Japan Blockchain Association this week, which added to bullish momentum. As for Sei (SEI), the token gains followed the announcement that the Wyoming Stable Token Commission selected it as one of two candidate blockchains for the state-backed WYST stablecoin. Most decentralised applications on Sei, including Yei Finance and Takara Lend, have also recorded increased adoption in recent weeks.

2025-06-21T09:58:47,"Norway Considers Temporary Ban on Crypto Mining to Address Energy Strain","The Norwegian government is weighing a temporary ban on cryptocurrency mining, citing concerns over electricity consumption, network capacity, and land use. In a notice issued Friday, officials announced that a formal investigation will be conducted in the autumn to evaluate the potential impact of mining operations. The outcome could lead to a temporary halt on such activities, aimed at redirecting resources toward more essential public and industrial needs. The potential ban would be under Norway’s Planning and Building Act, a legislative tool that allows the government to allocate energy usage and infrastructure. “It is uncertain how big a problem crypto mining will become in Norway in the future,” the government said, adding that newly introduced data center regulations requiring registration will help clarify the scope and footprint of crypto-related facilities. Rising Electricity Costs Norwegian households, like many across Europe, have seen a sharp increase in electricity prices over the past two years, largely driven by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent disruption in oil and gas supplies. This has added urgency to national efforts to prioritize energy allocation and limit non-essential power consumption . Local communities have also voiced frustrations over the noise generated by crypto mining farms, with several petitions calling for shutdowns of such operations. While mining may bring in revenue and investment, many argue it offers little social benefit and places an unnecessary burden on already strained infrastructure. Norway to Ban Mining? Norway’s proposal echoes similar moves in other regions. Earlier this year, Russia imposed mining bans across 10 regions to prevent power outages and reduce energy stress. China, once the global leader in Bitcoin mining, implemented a blanket ban in 2021, pushing many miners to relocate to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions like Texas in the United States. Despite ongoing environmental concerns, crypto mining remains legal across most of the U.S., where it continues to contribute significantly to the global Bitcoin hashrate. Lawmakers have raised questions about sustainability, but regulatory action has been sporadic and state-specific. For now, Norway’s move signals a growing shift among European nations toward reevaluating the energy-intensive nature of crypto mining.

2025-06-21T09:48:56,"Bitcoin Falls Below $104K as Retail Investor Sentiment Returns to Liberation Day Levels","Bitcoin (BTC) BTC continues to struggle for direction amid mounting macroeconomic pressures and a notable deterioration in retail investor sentiment. The asset is hovering near $103,700 following a volatile 24-hour stretch, in which it briefly dropped below $103,400 before staging a modest recovery, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. This price behavior reflects an uneasy market backdrop, shaped by both geopolitical tensions and uncertain monetary policy. According to an X post by crypto analytics firm Santiment on Thursday, sentiment among retail investors has turned sharply negative. The firm reported that the ratio of bullish to bearish commentary has fallen to just 1.03 to 1 — the lowest since early April, when the President Donald Trump unveiled his so-called Liberation Day tariffs, triggering peak market fear at the time. Santiment emphasized that this current wave of retail pessimism is unusually intense and, based on past patterns, may mark a contrarian signal for a price rebound. They specifically noted that back in April, Bitcoin rallied shortly after similar fear levels surfaced, suggesting large investors often use periods of retail capitulation to accumulate at favorable prices. Adding to the pressure is the Federal Reserve's recent decision to hold interest rates steady, which has kept btcoin trading in a relatively tight $100,000 to $110,000 range over the past month. Meanwhile, on-chain metrics show declining open interest on Binance, pointing to continued deleveraging among derivatives traders. At the same time, whale wallets have shown steady accumulation since 2023 — an indication that large holders are continuing to build their positions despite the short-term uncertainty. Technical Analysis Highlights BTC-USD traded in a 24-hour range between $106,552.98 and $102,411.01, a 3.89% swing as volatility spiked midday. A sharp drop occurred between 14:00 and 17:00 UTC, pushing price below $104,000 and forming strong resistance near $106,000 on above-average volume. Support emerged between $103,000 and $103,500, where price consolidated on declining volume during the final eight hours of the analysis period. A V-shaped rebound developed late in the session, with BTC rising from $103,363 to $103,618 and establishing a local floor near $103,500. Short-term momentum indicators showed mild recovery as the session closed near intraday highs, but follow-through remained limited.

2025-06-21T09:45:00,"LATAM crypto news: Bit2Me targets Latin American expansion, Paraguay fights Bitcoin extortions","Latin America’s crypto scene continues to evolve, with new products and regional expansions highlighting its rapid growth. This week’s most notable news is that Bit2Me, one of Spain’s biggest crypto exchanges, is planning to expand operations in Latin America. Paraguay, on the other hand, has announced a new effort to combat Bitcoin-based hacking and extortion as the country’s cryptocurrency sector expands. Bit2Me targets Latin American expansion Bit2Me, a renowned cryptocurrency exchange in Spain, has announced plans to expand into Latin America as part of its global growth strategy. The company plans to raise revenue from $24 million in 2024 to $26 million in 2025 through a combination of global expansion and strategic relationships with local banks in major markets such as Argentina, Peru, Brazil, and Mexico. Bit2Me is also planning to reach additional European markets such as Portugal, Italy, and France, aided by its efforts to secure the MiCA license. With over 1.2 million members and €3 billion in transaction volume in 2024, Bit2Me is focusing on compliance and advanced security measures, cementing its position as one of Spain’s most secure exchanges. Cyber attacks surge in Paraguay Paraguay has recently become a common target of cyberattacks, with hackers frequently demanding Bitcoin as a sort of ransom. These attacks, which include the theft of sensitive data and ransomware campaigns, have targeted both public and commercial organisations. The hacking of President Santiago Peña’s official Twitter account resulted in a false announcement about Bitcoin legalisation, causing alarm. Although the account was immediately restored, the breach exposed the country’s digital weaknesses and the growing complexity of cyber attacks. In response to these growing risks, Paraguay implemented the National Cybersecurity Strategy 2025-2028. Gustavo Villate, Minister of Information and Communication Technologies, spearheads the plan, which focuses on critical infrastructure protection, cybersecurity training, and international cooperation. The Armed Forces are also playing an important part in the implementation. The strategy intends to make Paraguay’s digital ecosystem more secure by decreasing human error and strengthening institutional resilience. However, its success is dependent on excellent execution and collaboration with allies such as the United States, Israel, and Taiwan. Brazil’s B3 exchange launches Ethereum and Solana futures B3, Brazil’s biggest stock exchange, announced futures contracts for Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) on Monday, boosting its portfolio of regulated cryptoassets as demand for blockchain-based financial products grows. The new derivatives represent a significant step for B3, which has been progressively establishing a regulated crypto market ecosystem in Latin America’s largest economy. The contracts will be priced in US dollars and reference the Nasdaq Ether and Nasdaq Solana Reference Prices. This development is a significant milestone for Brazil’s financial system, demonstrating the country’s willingness to incorporate regulated cryptocurrency products within a regular exchange structure. By providing advanced tools to both institutional and retail investors, B3 is positioning Brazil as a regional leader in crypto finance while also encouraging innovation in the country’s expanding digital asset ecosystem.

2025-06-21T09:41:27,"Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will WLD Price Reach $10?","The post Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will WLD Price Reach $10? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights The live price of the WLD token is $ 0.00349731 Price predictions for 2025 range from $1.10 to $4.18. Long-term forecasts suggest potential highs of $35.60 by 2030. Worldcoin made waves in early 2024 when its token WLD nearly hit $12, but since then, it has struggled to break past key resistance levels, even during bullish market events. With price action losing steam and investor interest fading, many wonder if the project is losing its shine. As it is backed by Sam Altman and focused on decentralized identity, Worldcoin is quietly building in the background. working hard in silence, maybe with the ongoing AI crypto bull run gaining momentum, Sam Altman’s brainchild, Worldcoin, could possibly create a significant buzz. As AI narratives gain traction, many are intrigued to know, “What does the future hold for Worldcoin?” or “Could WLD stage a comeback?” Let’s delve into the anticipated Worldcoin price predictions for 2025 to 2030 and the years to come Table of contents Overview CoinPedia’s WLD Price Prediction Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025 WLD Price Forecast 2026 – 2030 Worldcoin Price Forecast 2026 WLD Price Prediction 202 7 Worldcoin Price Forecast 2028 WLD AI Token Price Forecast 2029 Worldcoin AI Token Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency WorldCoin WDC Token WDC Price $ 0.00349731 -10.28% Market Cap $ 0.00 Circulating Supply 0.00 Trading Volume $ 5.1958 All-time High $11.82 on 10th March 2024 All-time Low $0.9758 on 13th September 2023 CoinPedia’s WLD Price Prediction As per Coinpedia’s Worldcoin Price Prediction, marketers’ optimism and the involvement of high-profile figures could significantly boost Worldcoin’s potential value. Further, this credibility and backing, combined with a potential increase in trading volume, could drive the price of WLD Coin to an impressive $5.89 by the end of 2025. If the market faces external pressures, then it could potentially drive the price down to a low of $1.61 . Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2025 1.61 3.25 5.89 Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025 The Q2 2025 price action for Worldcoin (WLD) clearly showed signs of exhaustion before it could push higher. Despite recent optimism, its inability to establish a sustained, long-term bullish trend remains evident. Looking at its historical performance, the recent Q2’s gains appear modest, like a mere bucket of water from a deep well. Since early 2024, WLD is still down over 80% from its highs, even with the latest price surge. The entire weekly price action on the Binance exchange resembles a converging price action structure in a falling channel. This pattern occurrence highlights the odds of future good returns remaining high. When a catalyst activates, it will shoot a breakout from this range. Many are now asking: What could truly push Worldcoin higher? As seen time and again in the crypto space, social sentiment is often the key driver. Renewed marketing efforts and the involvement of high-profile figures could significantly enhance Worldcoin’s value. If, in the coming sessions, optimistic momentum builds up, then WLD must achieve a Change of Character (ChoCh) in its current price structure by breaking above the $2.12 level in June or July. Once this level is cleared and a ChoCh is confirmed, Worldcoin could break out of its bearish pattern and potentially retest the $4.18 level by the end of 2025. However, if WLD fails to maintain a bullish trajectory this year, its price could drop as low as $0.70.

2025-06-21T09:32:13,"Bitcoin Demand Momentum Shows Bears Are Giving Up – Price Reversal Ahead?","The post Bitcoin Demand Momentum Shows Bears Are Giving Up – Price Reversal Ahead? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News June 21, 2025 – Bitcoin might be gearing up for a massive breakout—and it’s not just about technical patterns or ETF news this time. A sharp shift in demand momentum and rising Global Liquidity Index (GLI) has caught the eye of veteran analyst Crypto Rover. Let’s break down what the latest signals are telling us. Bears Are Backing Off, Bulls Taking Over According to a chart shared by Crypto Rover, Bitcoin’s demand momentum has plunged deep into negative territory. In simple words, short-term sellers are pulling back, while long-term holders are stepping in. Historically, this kind of shift tends to happen near market bottoms, often just before big price rallies. The bears are capitulating. Bitcoin demand momentum is deep in the red. A reversal is imminent! pic.twitter.com/3Nf0GmTJDH — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) June 21, 2025 At the same time, Bitcoin’s trading volume jumped 20% in the past 24 hours, reaching $47 billion . The spike in volume reflects a mix of panic selling and opportunistic buying, a classic sign of bear capitulation. Adding to the bullish signs, major players are placing bold bets. One whale, in particular, is holding a massive 20x long position on Bitcoin , valued at over $364.35 million, reflecting a growing confidence in BTC. Liquidity and Bitcoin in Sync Interestingly, Rover also compared recent Bitcoin’s price to global liquidity trends. Historically, when global liquidity rises, Bitcoin tends to follow suit, sometimes with explosive results. Notably, the current Global Liquidity Index (GLI) level mirrors the period when Bitcoin was trading around $100,000, implying that if the pattern holds, Bitcoin could soon revisit or even surpass this price point. Bitcoin will explode. Just like the global liquidity did. Watch this chart closely! pic.twitter.com/E5PRD48R3S — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) June 21, 2025 What Should Traders Watch Next? Volume Trends: Sustained high trading volumes could confirm that the capitulation phase is ending, signaling that selling pressure is subsiding. Support Levels: The $103,400 level remains a critical support zone. Holding above this threshold is essential for a bullish reversal. Technical Indicators: Watch for bullish crossovers in the MACD and RSI moving out of oversold territory, currently at 45 . As of now, Bitcoin is trading around $103.693, reflecting a drop of 2.2% seen in the last 24 hours, with a market cap hitting $2.06 trillion.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-demand-momentum-shows-bears-are-giving-up-reversal-ahead/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-21T09:30:53,"Norway Weighs Temporary Ban on Crypto Mining to Conserve Energy","Norway is exploring the possibility of imposing a temporary ban on cryptocurrency mining operations as part of a broader effort to safeguard national energy resources and improve the allocation of electricity. The country’s government announced Friday that it will conduct a detailed investigation this autumn to evaluate the impact of crypto mining on power consumption and local infrastructure. This process could ultimately lead to a temporary halt in mining operations. Officials cited the Planning and Building Act, a national legal framework that enables the government to control energy use and zoning policies, as the basis for such an action. “It is uncertain how big a problem crypto mining will become in Norway in the future,” the government said in a statement. They added that new regulations requiring registration of data centers involved in mining would provide authorities with greater insight into the scale and scope of the industry. Rising Energy Demands Prompt Policy Review The proposal comes amid growing energy concerns across Europe. Many residents in Norway have experienced significant increases in electricity costs, a trend exacerbated by the ongoing war in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russian oil and gas supplies. Local communities have also raised objections to crypto mining facilities due to noise pollution and their impact on residential life. In response to these pressures, some Norwegian regions have already begun pushing for tighter regulations or outright shutdowns of such operations. A Broader Pattern of Global Crackdowns Norway’s deliberation reflects a growing international trend. Countries around the world are becoming increasingly wary of the environmental and energy consequences of crypto mining. Russia, for example, enacted a ban on mining in ten regions earlier this year in an effort to prevent blackouts and lower electricity usage. In China, a sweeping nationwide ban introduced in 2021 forced miners to migrate their operations to other jurisdictions, including parts of the United States. Despite environmental concerns and public scrutiny, crypto mining remains legal across most U.S. states, making the country one of the leading contributors to the global Bitcoin hashrate. However, voices within the U.S. political landscape have continued to criticize the industry’s environmental footprint, fueling calls for greater regulatory oversight. Energy Policy and Environmental Impact Under Scrutiny For Norway, the challenge lies in balancing its goals for digital innovation and energy conservation. As the country continues to support a digital economy, policymakers appear to be reevaluating how much power can be devoted to non-essential or highly energy-intensive sectors like crypto mining. The government emphasized that the upcoming investigation will help it make data-driven decisions regarding the sustainability and scale of mining activities. While no immediate bans have been enforced, the potential for such measures signals a growing readiness to act if crypto mining begins to overwhelm Norway’s power grid or interfere with long-term environmental goals.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/norway-weighs-temporary-ban-on-crypto-mining-to-conserve-energy/,"ASIA|BTC|COMMODITY|MINING|REGULATION","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare
2025-06-21T09:30:17,"XRP Price Crash Tests Critical Support At $2.1, Will It Break?","After the market crash that sent the Bitcoin price falling toward $100,000, the XRP price also saw a notable decline, and this crash has brought it toward an important level. While the digital asset continues to hold above the $2.1 level, it remains critical support and a break below this could be negative for the price. This is outlined by crypto analyst The Alchemist Trader, who has shown what direction the XRP price could be headed in depending on what happens here. XRP Price Threatens Major Support Level After the almost 4.5% decline that ravaged the XRP price over the last week, it has been pushed down toward the next major support level, lying just above $2.09. So far, the bulls have defended this level, but the multiple tests suggest that a breakdown at this level could be in view. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts 20% Ethereum Price Crash Below $2,000, Here’s Why The analyst explains that the reason this level is so important is that it actually includes the value area low recorded in previous declines. Additionally, it is the 200-day moving average (MA) for the cryptocurrency, and also now serves as a key daily support/resistance flip. This means either camp of the bulls and bears can pull it in their direction, making it incredibly important for what happens to the XRP price in the short term. Given the importance of this level, whether it holds or breaks will carry serious implications for the XRP price. In the bearish scenario, the crypto analyst explains that a break below this support would trigger a liquidity sweep as the price dumps lower. The possibility of a break is even higher now, given that this level has already been tested multiple times. The Alchemist explains that each test weakens the level, putting it at risk of a breakdown. However, with long consolidation so far above this level, there is a bullish scenario that is rising. As bulls continue to maintain this support, further strength here could erode the possibility of a decline. If properly defended with a notable uptick in volume, in addition to a move upward into the recent local highs at $2.4, then it is likely that the XRP price continues to move up. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Wave Towards ATH Coming? Here Are The Targets “For bulls, a clean defense of this level with volume and a move back above recent local highs would indicate a potential rotation toward the next resistance,” the analysis read. “For bears, a breakdown without a reclaim increases the likelihood of continuation to the downside.” As for how to play the current trend, the analyst advises investors to exercise caution and wait for confirmation before taking positions. The confirmation here would either be a break below the support or a strong upward rally away from it, signaling a clear direction.

2025-06-21T09:15:50,"Litecoin, XRP and Solana ETF Applications Have 95% Chance of Approval This Year: Bloomberg Analysts","Litecoin ( LTC ), XRP and Solana ( SOL ) exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications all have overwhelming odds of approval this year, according to Bloomberg ETF analysts. James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas now say on the social media platform X that those three altcoins have a 95% chance of securing ETFs in 2025. They also give potential Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Cardano ( ADA ), Polkadot ( DOT ), Hedera ( HBAR ) and Avalanche ( AVAX ) ETFs a 90% chance of approval. A Sui ( SUI ) ETF application from the crypto asset manager Canary Capital has slightly lower odds, at 60%, and a Canary Tron ( TRX ) bid doesn’t have any chance in 2025, according to the analysts. Source: James Seyffart/X Seyffart also notes that Ethereum ( ETH ) staking ETFs are also “extremely likely” to be approved in 2025. Numerous other ETF applications have been filed for potential funds based on Axelar ( AXL ), BNB , Aptos ( APT ), Chainlink ( LINK ), Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ), Official Trump ( TRUMP ), Melania ( MELANIA ) and Bonk ( BONK ). Other potential new ETFs are tied to a basket of currencies, and a few are based on Bitcoin ( BTC ) and/or Ethereum, assets that have already been approved for inclusion in other spot ETFs. The SEC greenlit the first spot market Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, bringing in billions of dollars worth of inflows to the top digital asset by market cap. The regulator subsequently approved Ethereum ETFs for trading last July.

2025-06-21T09:08:55,"Bitcoin’s plunge triggered $495 million in liquidations","Bitcoin (BTC) plummeted to its lowest point this week, triggering almost half a billion worth of liquidations and rattling the crypto market as geopolitical tensions and heavy selling pressure spooked traders. The BTC price slipped back to the $102k zone before regaining the crucial $103k mark. The global digital assets market cap dropped by 2% over the past 24 hours to stand at $3.2 trillion. Its 24-hour trading volume surged by 40% to hit $112 billion, suggesting that traders are moving their funds quickly amid surging uncertainties. However, the fear and greed index flashes “neutral” sentiment among the investors. Liquidations soar to $500M The day that began with Bitcoin hitting $106K saw it dropping below $103,000 in a matter of hours. The pullback wasn’t limited to BTC as Ethereum (ETH) plunged by as much as 4.5% in just a couple of hours. ETH price fell to a low of $2,375 as its trading volumes spiked by 89% to hit $22 billion. Ether is trading at an average price of $2,425 with a marginal recovery. Solana, Cardano, and the biggest meme crypto, Dogecoin, were also swept up in the selloff. Their price dropped between 3% and 5% during the same session. Meanwhile, Sei has turned out to be the biggest gainer among the top 100 crypto. Sei price is up by 10% in the last 24 hours and is trading around $0.22 at press time. The sell-off has triggered widespread liquidations across the crypto derivatives market. CoinGlass data shows that 127k traders got liquidated over the last 24 hours, as the liquidations went on to hit $495 million. The single largest liquidation order of BTC/USD valued at $8 million happened on Bybit. Source: CoinGlass Around $413 million worth of liquidated positions (84%) turn out to be long bets. This suggests that traders were hoping that bullish momentum would continue ahead, but the cumulative crypto market printed red indexes. Ethereum liquidations outpaced Bitcoin’s, totaling $177 million compared to Bitcoin’s $122 million. Bitcoin is trading at an average price of $103,485 at press time, which traders have been watching closely for a while. Its 24-hour trading volume is up by 34% to stand at $48.8 billion. Bitcoin’s overheating zone cleared? According to CryptoQuant data , the heatmap chart tells the story that the $103K liquidation cluster, which previously acted as a concentration point for overleveraged long positions, was completely dismantled. As Bitcoin broke through this key level, a sharp wick pushed prices below $102,500, flushing out traders who had entered long positions with insufficient margin or poor risk management. Binance’s liquidation delta chart corroborates this move, showing a pronounced spike of over $160 million in long liquidations within minutes of the breakdown. Simultaneously, Binance’s Net Taker Volume, smoothed over a seven-hour moving average. It plunged deeply into negative territory, hitting nearly negative $100 million. It’s the third time this month the metric has nosedived to such extremes. The metric showed that the sell-off may have felt brutal in the moment, but events like these can ultimately be constructive. Aggressive liquidations and deep negative taker volumes typically signal that speculative excess has been flushed from the system. It suggests that the removal of weak-handed leverage can make the way for more stable price action. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Key Takeaways: CoinMarketCap was hacked after a fake wallet verification popup appeared on its site, triggering phishing concerns. MetaMask and Phantom flagged the site as unsafe, warning users against connecting wallets. The breach has revived criticism of CoinMarketCap’s security, nearly four years after its major data leak. The phishing-style notification asked users to connect their wallets and approve ERC-20 token access, raising immediate red flags across the crypto community. Wallet providers like MetaMask and Phantom quickly flagged the site as unsafe, with Phantom displaying a browser warning against using the platform. CoinMarketCap Removes Malicious Popup In a Friday post on X , CoinMarketCap confirmed the removal of the malicious popup. “We’ve identified and removed the malicious code from our site,” the platform said. The company added that it is continuing to investigate the breach and is reinforcing its security measures to prevent similar incidents. Update: We've identified and removed the malicious code from our site. Our team is continuing to investigate and taking steps to strengthen our security. — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) June 21, 2025 The malicious prompt, which triggered warnings from wallet providers like MetaMask and Phantom, reportedly asked users to connect their wallets and approve access to ERC-20 tokens. Phantom’s browser extension even flagged CoinMarketCap as “unsafe to use,” raising concerns about the platform’s vulnerability. Reports of the phishing attempt began circulating across crypto social media, with several users alerting others not to interact with the prompt. Many suspected the attack was an attempt to steal wallet credentials through a fake interface mimicking a legitimate verification process. The incident has reignited concerns about CoinMarketCap’s security, coming nearly four years after a 2021 data breach exposed the email addresses of over 3.1 million users. That data was later discovered for sale on hacking forums, prompting criticism over the platform’s safeguards. SECURITY ALERT We're seeing reports that @CoinMarketCap 's front end has been compromised and is trying to trick people into linking their wallets, presumably to drain them. pic.twitter.com/a0JREDSPvS — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) June 20, 2025 CoinMarketCap, owned by Binance, remains one of the most widely used resources in the crypto space, making it a prime target for malicious actors looking to exploit its credibility. Users are urged to avoid connecting wallets to unsolicited prompts and to verify all interactions through official channels. The company has not disclosed the source of the breach but has committed to ongoing security reviews. Crypto Crime Turns Violent as Illicit Transactions Top $40B in 2024 Illicit cryptocurrency activity surged to at least $40.9 billion in 2024, according to Chainalysis, with the number likely to grow as more criminal-linked wallets are identified. Hacks alone accounted for $2.2 billion in stolen assets, a 21% increase from the previous year. North Korean-linked groups, including Lazarus and Tradetraitor, were behind over 60% of those thefts, with major incidents like the $300 million hack of Japan’s DMM Bitcoin exchange among their hits. But the threats go beyond online exploits. Criminal groups are using crypto to fund and conceal a wider range of crimes—from investment scams and AI-enhanced romance frauds to drug trafficking and even physical violence. In one alarming case on May 13, 2025, the daughter and grandson of Paymium’s CEO were nearly kidnapped in Paris by masked men.

The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Bitcoin: Pioneering a New Era of Digital Currency Bitcoin, often dubbed the world's first cryptocurrency, has revolutionized the way we think about money. Introduced by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, it offers a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that operates without a central authority. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin isn't printed or minted; it's a digital asset maintained by a distributed network of computers called nodes. Transactions are verified by miners through a process of solving complex puzzles, ensuring the integrity and security of the network. This innovative system removes the need for intermediaries like banks, making transactions faster and potentially more secure. As we navigate the current market cycle, Bitcoin's potential continues to spark interest. The network undergoes a ""halving"" approximately every four years, reducing the reward for miners by half. This process, designed to cap the total supply at 21 million bitcoins, can influence the network's stability and mining profitability. Compared to newer cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin remains the most established and widely recognized. Its limited supply and increasing adoption suggest a resilient future, though the market remains volatile. Whether Bitcoin is an attractive option now depends on individual perspectives, but its pioneering technology and growing role in the financial world are hard to ignore. ADA Coin: Cardano's Green Revolution in the Crypto World Cardano is shaking up the cryptocurrency scene. It's a platform built for smart contracts, making it easy to create apps, tokens, and games without middlemen. Its coin, ADA, competes with Ethereum's ETH. With ADA, users can store value, make payments, and help secure the network by staking. What makes Cardano special is its eco-friendly approach. It uses proof-of-stake, which is much more energy-efficient than the methods used by many other cryptocurrencies. In today's market, ADA shows great promise. Cardano's technology allows fast transactions, potentially handling up to a million per second. This speed comes from its unique two-layer system, separating transactions from smart contracts. Since 2021, Cardano's native tokens have made interactions with smart contracts safer and cheaper. As the crypto world moves towards sustainability and efficiency, ADA stands out. It's an attractive option for those interested in the future of cryptocurrency. Monero: Your Money, Your Business Monero (XMR) was launched in 2014 with a clear goal: to let people make private transactions. While many think Bitcoin hides their identity, it's actually easy to trace payments back because blockchains are open for all to see. Monero changes this by using advanced cryptography to hide both the sender and the receiver. The team behind Monero puts privacy and security first. They want everyone to have protection, no matter how tech-savvy they are. Monero aims to let payments happen quickly and cheaply, without fear of censorship. In a world where digital footprints are everywhere, Monero offers a way to keep your financial dealings to yourself. This makes it stand out from other cryptocurrencies that are less private. With growing concerns about data privacy, Monero's technology has big potential. In the current market, where regulations are tightening, a coin like Monero could become more attractive. It provides a level of anonymity that others don't. As more people seek privacy, Monero might see increased interest compared to more transparent coins. Chainlink: Bridging Blockchains with the Real World Chainlink is changing how smart contracts work. It connects them to real-world data, like prices and events. This makes them more useful and powerful. Chainlink uses a network of oracles to fetch and verify data. These oracles have a reputation score to ensure the data is accurate. The system combines on-chain and off-chain processes. On-chain, it manages data requests. Off-chain, it gathers the data. The LINK token powers this ecosystem. It rewards those who provide data and keeps the network secure through staking. In the current market, Chainlink stands out. Its ability to connect blockchains with external data fills a crucial gap. As more decentralized apps emerge, the need for reliable data grows. Unlike some coins that offer limited utility, LINK has a clear purpose. Its technology is mature compared to newer projects. With the increasing focus on DeFi and real-world asset tokenization, Chainlink's role becomes even more important. Investing in LINK could be attractive for those looking at long-term growth in the crypto space. Conclusion BTC, ADA, XMR, and LINK are strong options, but XYZVerse ($XYZ) stands out as the first sports memecoin, aiming for 20,000% growth with its unique blend of memes and sports.

2025-06-21T08:52:02,"Bitcoin Price Slides to $103K as Major Altcoins Crash (Weekend Watch)","The broader cryptocurrency market continues struggling amid mounting geopolitical and economic pressures. Bitcoin’s price has lost almost 3% on the day, while major altcoins such as Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and others chart even more considerable declines. Bitcoin Price Tumbles toward $103K Bitcoin is charting a near 3% loss in the past 24 hours in what seems to be a broader crypto market selloff. As seen in the chart below, the price tumbled from around $106,000 to an intraday low at $102,400 before bouncing and settling at where it current trades at the time of this writing. Source: TradingView As CryptoPotato reported, however, the common theme amongst the majority of cryptocurrency analysts and experts is that Bitcoin’s price trading at around $100,000 is indicative of institutional dominance and not retail FOMO. This suggests that it has much more staying power because institutions are a lot less likely to sell during temporary and sudden drawdowns like the current one. At the same time, however, the war between Israel and Iran continues , driving oil prices up and causing turmoil on stock markets as well. Altcoins Crash Harder than BTC The heatmap below paints a clear picture: most of the altcoins are trading in the red and are charting consiedrable losses. Namely, some of the larger-cap cryptocurrencies such as ETH, SOL, ADA, DOGE, HYPE, BCH, LINK, AVAX, and more, are declining for more than 3% during the past 24 hours. Interestingly enough, Bitcoin’s dominance – the metric, which tracks its share relative to that of the rest of the market is up by more than 1% during the same period. This shows that BTC is performing a lot better and altcoins are completely unable to capitalize on its drawdown. In fact, this seems to be the other theme of the current cycle.

Hedera Price prediction highlights HBAR could reach $0.750 by the end of 2025 if bullish trends continue. The Long-term forecasts suggest HBAR could hit $2.20 by 2030, indicating stable growth potential. Hedera has been making waves in the crypto space, having entered the top 20 digital assets by market cap in 2024, and now eyeing a potential leap into the top 10 by the end of 2025. With increasing real-world use cases, institutional interest, and strategic partnerships, many are closely tracking HBAR price prediction 2025 to gauge how high the token can rise. With major companies like Google, IBM, and Chainlink Labs backing the project, and talks of an HBAR ETF approval, many are asking: Will HBAR Price Hit $1?

All-time low. $0.01001 (January 2nd, 2020). Hedera Price Projection 2025 Since peaking at $0.40 in mid-January 2025, the HBAR price has been on a steady decline. External factors dragged it into a falling wedge pattern, reaching a low of $0.125 in early April. However, from the second week of April, a broader crypto rally lifted HBAR as well. It broke out of the wedge, rebounding from a strong support zone, the same area that fueled the Q4 2024 rally. This zone, confirmed by the FRVP indicator, showed high buying interest and supported a sharp rebound. HBAR surged nearly 80%, climbing from $0.125 to $0.228 in April to mid-May. But the momentum didn’t hold. Over the last 40 days, HBAR dropped around 35%, with 21% of that loss occurring in just 10 days. Currently, HBAR is forming another falling wedge with its price trading near its lower boundary, and inching to retest the high-demand zone again. If bulls regain strength, at this zone, then in June or July, HBAR could retest the $0.19 resistance area. A breakout above this resistance area could follow, potentially reaching $0.27 in the upcoming Q3. Looking further ahead, a daily close above $0.27 could open the path to $0.40. If momentum continues, HBAR might even touch $0.75 by year-end. On the downside, failure to hold support may push the price down toward $0.072. Meanwhile, internal developments tell a different story. Hedera’s ecosystem continues to grow. In 2025, it launched its first native hardware wallet, Citadel , and an AI-based tool, the Hedera Agent Kit , making token creation more accessible. Another major project, HashSphere, is due in Q3 2025. It aims to offer a private, regulated blockchain for stablecoin-based payments and asset management. To streamline operations, Hedera also rebranded key entities on May 15. The HBAR Foundation is now the “Hedera Foundation,” and the Governing Council is the “Hedera Council.” In short, while external pressures weigh on price, Hedera’s internal progress remains strong. If macro conditions improve, 2025 could still bring a major turnaround.

2025-06-21T08:23:19,"Cardano’s Treasury Strategy Targets Bitcoin DeFi Boom","The post Cardano’s Treasury Strategy Targets Bitcoin DeFi Boom appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Cardano is making strategic moves to strengthen its DeFi ecosystem, backed by solid fundamentals and community support. With its treasury holding around 1.7 billion ADA, founder Charles Hoskinson has laid out plans to convert a portion into stablecoins to fuel liquidity and long-term growth. However this new proposal has ignited discussion in the Cardano ecosystem , suggesting a strategic deployment of the blockchain’s billion-dollar treasury to bring in both Bitcoin and stablecoin liquidity. Andrew Throuvalas, a researcher and Bitcoin advocate, believes Cardano is uniquely positioned to lead the next phase of Bitcoin DeFi, and the moment to act is now. CARDANO TREASURY DEBATE: BITCOIN AND STABLECOINS Here's my perspective as a Bitcoiner who a) has a majority BTC position, and b) wants to put it into DeFi. Cardano community should ABSOLUTELY deploy treasury funds toward intelligent efforts to bring both BTC and… pic.twitter.com/hWWaVtydew — Andrew | BitcoinOS (@AThrouvalas) June 20, 2025 Meanwhile, Cardano adoption is rising fast, with 110 million transactions and 22 billion ADA staked across 3,000 pools, showing strong community and growing DeFi activity. Built for Bitcoin DeFi but Missing Liquidity Cardano’s architecture shares key similarities with Bitcoin, and its DeFi infrastructure has proven secure and reliable over time. Projects like BitcoinOS and Charms are laying the foundation for bridgeless Bitcoin integration on Cardano, which could support what Throuvalas describes as a $2 trillion DeFi opportunity for Bitcoin. Loopholes? However, two major gaps remain. Cardano currently lacks deep stablecoin liquidity, making it difficult for institutions or large holders to operate at scale without experiencing slippage. In addition, competing ecosystems such as Arbitrum are rapidly building towards similar goals, while Cardano’s unique advantages remain underappreciated by the broader crypto market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Crash Coming! Altcoins to Drop 50–80%, Bitcoin to Face 45% Crash , Stablecoin Pools and BTC Incentives Proposed To close this gap, Throuvalas proposes allocating treasury funds to leading Cardano protocols such as Minswap, Liqwid Finance, and Indigo Protocol. By building large stablecoin pools, these platforms could offer Bitcoin holders the ability to borrow against their BTC more effectively, a critical use case for Bitcoin DeFi participants. He further suggests converting a portion of the ADA treasury into Bitcoin and using it to pay out yield directly in BTC. This would reward users who bring their Bitcoin to the Cardano network. As a precedent, Babylon has already attracted more than $4.5 billion in BTC with similar mechanisms, even though yields are paid in tokens rather than Bitcoin itself. A Timely Opportunity for Cardano Throuvalas believes this approach could significantly boost activity on Cardano and establish it as a long-term hub for Bitcoin DeFi. With its secure infrastructure and untapped treasury, the network could capture lasting value and demand for ADA if it moves quickly to attract Bitcoin liquidity. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

While the intent is to boost liquidity, converting a large ADA amount could create short-term selling pressure. However, proponents argue the market is deep enough to absorb it without significant price impact. What are the potential risks of converting ADA into stablecoins and Bitcoin now? Risks include potential short-term price volatility for ADA due to sales, and the stablecoin market itself carries inherent volatility and regulatory risks. It could also signal a lack of confidence in ADA’s long-term value to some. Could this move attract institutional investors, and if so, what additional infrastructure or compliance measures would be needed? Yes, increased stablecoin and Bitcoin liquidity could attract institutions. This would require robust institutional-grade compliance, security, and potentially tailored financial products like tokenized real-world assets.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/cardanos-treasury-strategy-targets-bitcoin-defi-boom/,"ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION","News|Altcoins",cryptocompare
2025-06-21T08:23:03,"Exploring the Next Wave of Potential Crypto Millionaires by December 2025","As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, certain digital tokens stand out for their potential to generate significant financial returns by December 2025. This article explores a range of coins, including meme tokens and established cryptocurrencies, that are poised for potential growth. Introduction to $XYZ: The Meme Coin Making Waves The crypto community has been buzzing about $XYZ, a meme coin that made an impressive debut by raising $14 million in its early stages. The meme coin, known for its rapid value increase from $0.0001 to $0.003333 during the presale, is now preparing for further growth. Its next target price is $0.005 in the upcoming presale stage. Once the presale concludes, $XYZ is slated for listing on both centralized and decentralized exchanges, promising more exposure and potentially higher value. The community around $XYZ is characterized by its dynamic and engaging nature, promising substantial rewards and incentives. These aspects are crucial for those looking to invest in the potential next big meme coin. Bitcoin: The Stalwart of Digital Currency Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, continues to be a robust choice for investors. It operates on a decentralized network, free from the confines of traditional financial institutions. Bitcoin's innovative technology and its scheduled ""halvings"" contribute to its appeal by potentially increasing its scarcity and value over time. Cardano (ADA): Pioneering Eco-Friendly Blockchain Solutions Cardano stands out in the crypto market with its proof-of-stake mechanism, which not only enhances transaction efficiency but also reduces environmental impact. ADA, Cardano's native token, is crucial for both network security through staking and as a means for transaction and smart contract facilitation. Monero: Championing Privacy Monero offers enhanced privacy, allowing users to conduct transactions without traces. This focus on security and anonymity is increasingly important in a digital age where privacy concerns are escalating. Chainlink: The Link Between Blockchains and Real-World Data Chainlink facilitates the integration of external data into blockchain networks, a critical feature for the functionality of smart contracts. This capability makes LINK an essential part of the growing decentralized finance sector.

Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Bitcoin: Pioneering a New Era of Digital Currency Bitcoin, often dubbed the world's first cryptocurrency, has revolutionized the way we think about money. Introduced by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, it offers a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that operates without a central authority. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin isn't printed or minted; it's a digital asset maintained by a distributed network of computers called nodes. Transactions are verified by miners through a process of solving complex puzzles, ensuring the integrity and security of the network. This innovative system removes the need for intermediaries like banks, making transactions faster and potentially more secure. As we navigate the current market cycle, Bitcoin's potential continues to spark interest. The network undergoes a ""halving"" approximately every four years, reducing the reward for miners by half. This process, designed to cap the total supply at 21 million bitcoins, can influence the network's stability and mining profitability. Compared to newer cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin remains the most established and widely recognized. Its limited supply and increasing adoption suggest a resilient future, though the market remains volatile. Whether Bitcoin is an attractive option now depends on individual perspectives, but its pioneering technology and growing role in the financial world are hard to ignore. ADA Coin: Cardano's Green Revolution in the Crypto World Cardano is shaking up the cryptocurrency scene. It's a platform built for smart contracts, making it easy to create apps, tokens, and games without middlemen. Its coin, ADA, competes with Ethereum's ETH. With ADA, users can store value, make payments, and help secure the network by staking. What makes Cardano special is its eco-friendly approach. It uses proof-of-stake, which is much more energy-efficient than the methods used by many other cryptocurrencies. In today's market, ADA shows great promise. Cardano's technology allows fast transactions, potentially handling up to a million per second. This speed comes from its unique two-layer system, separating transactions from smart contracts. Since 2021, Cardano's native tokens have made interactions with smart contracts safer and cheaper. As the crypto world moves towards sustainability and efficiency, ADA stands out. It's an attractive option for those interested in the future of cryptocurrency. Monero: Your Money, Your Business Monero (XMR) was launched in 2014 with a clear goal: to let people make private transactions. While many think Bitcoin hides their identity, it's actually easy to trace payments back because blockchains are open for all to see. Monero changes this by using advanced cryptography to hide both the sender and the receiver. The team behind Monero puts privacy and security first. They want everyone to have protection, no matter how tech-savvy they are. Monero aims to let payments happen quickly and cheaply, without fear of censorship. In a world where digital footprints are everywhere, Monero offers a way to keep your financial dealings to yourself. This makes it stand out from other cryptocurrencies that are less private. With growing concerns about data privacy, Monero's technology has big potential. In the current market, where regulations are tightening, a coin like Monero could become more attractive. It provides a level of anonymity that others don't. As more people seek privacy, Monero might see increased interest compared to more transparent coins. Chainlink: Bridging Blockchains with the Real World Chainlink is changing how smart contracts work. It connects them to real-world data, like prices and events. This makes them more useful and powerful. Chainlink uses a network of oracles to fetch and verify data. These oracles have a reputation score to ensure the data is accurate. The system combines on-chain and off-chain processes. On-chain, it manages data requests. Off-chain, it gathers the data. The LINK token powers this ecosystem. It rewards those who provide data and keeps the network secure through staking. In the current market, Chainlink stands out. Its ability to connect blockchains with external data fills a crucial gap. As more decentralized apps emerge, the need for reliable data grows. Unlike some coins that offer limited utility, LINK has a clear purpose. Its technology is mature compared to newer projects. With the increasing focus on DeFi and real-world asset tokenization, Chainlink's role becomes even more important. Investing in LINK could be attractive for those looking at long-term growth in the crypto space. Conclusion While BTC, ADA, XMR, and LINK are strong choices this quarter, XYZVerse ($XYZ) stands out as a pioneering sports memecoin aiming for remarkable growth.

2025-06-21T08:17:05,"Expert Makes Bullish $100 XRP Price Scenario","The Modern Investor, a popular voice in the cryptocurrency space, has argued that XRP’s price, hovering around $2.16, is a clear indication that the crypto market is still in its early stages. He made this statement in a recent video , where he compared XRP’s present value to Bitcoin’s current price of just over $104,000, emphasizing that both assets are still far below where many believe they are ultimately headed. According to him, the absence of a $100 XRP or a multi-million-dollar Bitcoin reinforces the idea that digital assets have significant ground left to cover. This view is not based on short-term trends but on long-term expectations shaped by earlier forecasts and multi-cycle price growth projections. Long-Term Growth Is Achievable Rather than dismiss the idea of XRP reaching $100 , The Modern Investor acknowledged its potential, even if the timeline remains uncertain. He referred to past predictions that estimated such growth might occur over several market cycles. While those forecasts were speculative, he argued they were not implausible. He noted that many retail participants often misunderstand the value of long-term strategy in crypto. Price appreciation does not usually occur overnight, but those who invest early and remain consistent have historically been rewarded. His message was intended to refocus investor attention on patience and steady accumulation. Cost Barriers for XRP Accumulation Rising Quickly A major point in his discussion centered on the growing difficulty of acquiring large quantities of XRP. He cited an often-mentioned target of holding 10,000 XRP, a benchmark introduced by analyst Edoardo Farina. Currently, this amount would require an investment of over $21,000. Both The Modern Investor and Farina agree that while this target was once accessible, it has become increasingly out of reach for most people. The original intention may have been to encourage early participation, but the numbers today no longer reflect a typical investor’s capacity. According to Farina, acquiring such a position may soon become impossible for nearly all retail participants. The Door Has Not Closed for Determined Buyers Despite rising costs, The Modern Investor believes the market still offers opportunity. He mentioned that many of his viewers began accumulating digital assets in small amounts several years ago and are now well-positioned, even if they never reached the 10,000 XRP mark. He also pointed to recent data showing that holding just over 11,000 XRP puts investors in the top 4% globally, showing how even modest portfolios can lead to significant standing in the ecosystem through regular market growth and passive income strategies like staking .

2025-06-21T08:16:10,"U.S. Policy Is Moving Slow—But Crypto Traders Aren’t Waiting!","The post U.S. Policy Is Moving Slow—But Crypto Traders Aren’t Waiting! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News While crypto investors often look to Washington for clues about the next big market move, it seems that public emotions and crowd behavior might be playing an even bigger role. With U.S. interest rates on hold, spending bills, and stablecoin rules, the crypto market often moves faster than the news itself. But the bigger question remains—are traders reacting to real changes or reacting to what they expect will happen? Fed Says ‘No Cut Yet’ When the Federal Reserve recently held rates steady at 4.25%–4.50% , nobody was surprised. But many crypto investors had secretly hoped for hints of future rate cuts. That didn’t happen. Fed Chair Jerome Powell played it safe, saying they’ll wait and watch inflation. This lack of clarity left crypto investors uncertain. Bitcoin, which had climbed as high as $112,000 the previous week, dropped 8% and hovered around $104,000. This shows that the market had likely “priced in” the Fed’s decision ahead of time. Interestingly, altcoins like Solana, XRP, and Cardano, which usually react more sharply to market news, remained relatively stable. According to Santiment’s on-chain data , traders appear to be following a pattern of “sell the rumor, buy the news,” reflecting indecision in a market waiting for a clearer direction. GENIUS Act Brings Hope and Worry to Stablecoin Another major update is the GENIUS Act, a bill passed by the U.S. Senate. It’s designed to bring clear rules to stablecoins like USDC and USDT. The bill says these tokens must be backed by real dollars and overseen by trusted financial regulators. If it becomes law, it’ll force companies like Circle and Coinbase to follow strict rules and hold real-dollar reserves. So far, social sentiment is bullish. But traders had already bought the rumor. If the House delays the bill, or nothing major follows, we could see prices cool off. Bitcoin and the ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ The U.S. government’s massive spending plan, dubbed the “Big Beautiful Bill,” has reignited Bitcoin’s inflation hedge story. With fears of more money printing, many are turning to BTC as a way to protect their savings. Our latest insight takes a look at the ongoing saga between Powell & Trump, the GENIUS Act, and the Big Beautiful Bill. These American fiscal decisions can have enormous impact on crypto's future. We explore. https://t.co/w3gvYollBL pic.twitter.com/CJQpp0N38j — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 21, 2025 There’s also fresh interest in privacy coins like Monero and DeFi platforms like MakerDAO.

2025-06-21T08:08:27,"Connecticut teen admits role in $245 million Bitcoin heist","A Connecticut man has pleaded guilty to participating in a theft of $245 million in Bitcoin. According to reports, the suspect, Veer Chetal, pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering conspiracy charges after his parents were kidnapped. According to court documents that were unsealed this week, 19-year-old Chetal from Danbury, Connecticut, has also agreed to testify against his co-defendants. The Connecticut native was one of three men charged in an online scam last August, stealing about 4,100 Bitcoins from their victim, a resident in Washington D.C. Reports claimed that the trio used the proceeds from the heist to live a luxury lifestyle, spending millions on cars, jewelry, rental mansions and nightclub parties. Connecticut native docked for Bitcoin theft after parents’ kidnap According to authorities, a week after Chetal and his co-conspirators carried out the crime, his parents were kidnapped and assaulted. Although the attack failed, authorities believed that the attacker had aimed to use the kidnap to coerce Chetal, who they believed had a large amount of digital assets, into using part of the funds to secure his parents’ release. Chetal’s parents were said to be in their new Lamborghini SUV when the attackers forced them out and assaulted them. Police, at the time, mentioned that after they were taken, the attackers bound them and forced them into their waiting van. Witnesses immediately called the police. The police were able to react quickly, arresting four men after they abandoned their vehicles and the van to flee on foot. Two other suspects were later arrested at a nearby home the group rented through an Airbnb, authorities said. During the hearing, one of the defendants, Michael Rivas, apologized for his actions. He said it was a dumb idea and he only did it to help one of the co-defendants who had a vendetta, although he did not elaborate. Meanwhile, his lawyer said that he only accepted to be a part of the gang in hopes of getting a share of the loot. At the time, there were reports of a Bitcoin theft where the assailants had been reportedly involved in a massive spending spree. Chetal agrees to testify against his co-defendants The criminal case involving the Connecticut native was unsealed on Monday in a Washington federal court, revealing his guilty plea in November and an agreement to cooperate with federal authorities investigating the Bitcoin theft. It also revealed the prosecutors are looking into new allegations that he was involved in about 50 other thefts where he stole more than $3 million from November 2023 to September 2024. Authorities also claimed that Chetal was also involved in a $2 million crypto theft that took place in October, but refused to tell them about it. Last September, federal agents with a search warrant raided the Connecticut native’s Brunswick, New Jersey apartment and his parent’s home in Danbury in connection to the Bitcoin theft. Investigators mentioned that they found more than $500,000 in cash, expensive jewelry and watches, and luxury clothes. Federal agents also added that Chetal had about $39 million worth of digital assets that he turned over to investigators. Authorities claimed that Chetal could face deportation as part of the criminal case. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Historically, Bitcoin dips again before rallying, possibly pulling XRP’s price lower. XRP’s RSI trendline recently broke, hinting at a big move ahead. The cryptocurrency market has been pretty dull lately, with both Bitcoin and XRP trading sideways. Prices aren’t going up or down in a big way, and traders are waiting for a breakout. However, this calm period is called an accumulation phase, where the price stays in a tight range before making a strong move. Crypto experts now have compared XRP’s current price movement to Bitcoin’s past market cycles. Similar patterns happened with Bitcoin in 2020 and even with the stock market. In both cases, prices hit a high, dropped about 50%, stayed flat for a while, and then broke out to much higher levels. Historically, Bitcoin often dips one more time before starting a new rally. If that happens again, XRP’s price could also drop, depending on how long Bitcoin takes to make its move.

Altcoins to Drop 50–80%, Bitcoin to Face 45% Crash appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is down 3% today , bringing the total market cap to $3 trillion. Bitcoin has dropped to $103,000, down 1.1%. Major altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP are also down by up to 3%, while memecoins such as Dogecoin, Litecoin, and others continue to slide. Top analyst Crypto Capo had recently issued a strong warning saying, “We haven’t seen anything yet.” He warns that altcoins are already dropping hard, even though Bitcoin is still above $100K. Altcoins Could Drop 50–70%, Memecoins To Face 80% Wipeout He identifies two key support levels for Bitcoin: first at $93,000 and then the main support zone between $60K and $ 70 K. This would be a 35-45% decline from the current prices. In a full-blown capitulation or a Black Swan scenario, the analyst says Ethereum could drop 45-55% and reach the $1000-$1200 range. Altcoins are expected to drop 50-70% on average, while memecoins could be hit the hardest. They could crash by up to 60-80%, as per the analyst. He expects the real drop to begin once Bitcoin breaks the $100,000 level. That is when bearish momentum could accelerate sharply. He also shared a few examples of coins that are already collapsing before Bitcoin’s drawdown. Charts Point to Memecoin Meltdown Crypto Capo’s charts show memecoins are on the edge of major breakdowns. FARTCOIN is at risk of dropping 61% to the first support zone around $0.38, and possibly 82% drop to $0.17 if it falls further. RETARDIO is stuck below resistance and showing weakness. Despite several bounces, it’s stuck in a lower range, showing signs of exhaustion. PEPE has triggered a bearish Head and Shoulders pattern, with an expected 70% drop ahead. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP Prices are Down Today? , Slow Bleed Continues CryptoQuant data also shows that altcoins are still deep in a slump.

2025-06-21T07:50:55,"Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong: Why the World Desperately Needs Crypto Now","BitcoinWorld Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong: Why the World Desperately Needs Crypto Now In a recent and impactful statement, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong took to social media to share a powerful message resonating with many in the digital asset space: the World needs crypto , perhaps now more than at any point in recent history. This isn’t just a bold claim from a figurehead in the industry; it’s a perspective rooted in observing significant global economic trends that he believes cryptocurrency is uniquely positioned to address. Why Does Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong Believe Crypto is Essential? Brian Armstrong’s assertion stems from several critical global economic challenges. He specifically highlighted three major concerns driving his conviction: Exponentially Growing Debt Levels: Across nations, both public and private debt continues to balloon. This unsustainable growth raises questions about future economic stability and the potential for currency devaluation as governments potentially resort to printing more money to service debt. Widespread Inflation: Many countries are grappling with persistent inflation, eroding purchasing power and making it harder for individuals and families to save and maintain their standard of living. Traditional financial systems often struggle to contain this, leaving citizens vulnerable. Erosion of Economic Freedom: Armstrong argues that economic freedom is being chipped away globally. This can manifest in various ways, from capital controls and censorship of transactions to limited access to financial services for large portions of the world’s population. According to the Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong , these intertwined issues create a pressing need for alternative financial systems that are more resilient, accessible, and permissionless than traditional finance. He sees crypto as that necessary alternative. Exploring the Core Crypto Benefits Armstrong Highlights When we talk about why the World needs crypto , we’re really talking about the fundamental advantages that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology offer in the face of the challenges Armstrong outlined. The crypto benefits that stand out include: Decentralization: Unlike traditional currencies controlled by central banks, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin operate on decentralized networks. This removes single points of control and potential failure, offering a degree of independence from government fiscal policies that can lead to inflation or debt crises. Permissionless Access: Anyone with an internet connection can access and use cryptocurrencies. This is a massive step towards global financial inclusion, particularly for the estimated 1.7 billion adults worldwide who remain unbanked but may have mobile phones. This directly combats the erosion of economic freedom by providing financial tools to everyone. Transparency and Security: Transactions on public blockchains are transparent (though parties can be pseudonymous) and secured by cryptographic principles. This contrasts with opaque traditional financial systems and offers a level of security against censorship or arbitrary seizure. Potential Hedge Against Inflation: While volatile, some cryptocurrencies, particularly those with capped supplies like Bitcoin, are viewed by proponents as a potential store of value and a hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies caused by inflation and excessive money printing. Understanding crypto and inflation dynamics is crucial for many seeking alternatives to traditional savings methods. These inherent features form the bedrock of Armstrong’s argument that crypto is not just a speculative asset class, but a vital tool for navigating the current global economic landscape. How Does Crypto Offer Economic Freedom Crypto? The concept of Economic freedom crypto is central to Brian Armstrong’s vision. What does this truly mean in practice? It means giving individuals greater autonomy over their finances. Consider a few scenarios: An individual in a country experiencing hyperinflation can hold value in a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or a stablecoin, preserving their wealth better than holding the rapidly devaluing local currency. A freelancer working for international clients can receive payments quickly and cheaply using crypto, bypassing slow and expensive traditional cross-border transfer systems that often involve multiple intermediaries and fees. People living under authoritarian regimes or in areas with underdeveloped banking infrastructure can access financial services, store value, and transact without needing permission from a bank or government entity. This ability to transact, save, and invest without intermediaries or geographic limitations is the essence of the Economic freedom crypto promises. It empowers individuals and reduces reliance on potentially unstable or restrictive traditional financial systems. Addressing Crypto and Inflation Concerns One of the most discussed aspects of why the World needs crypto , according to Armstrong, is its role in combating inflation. The relationship between Crypto and inflation is complex, but the core idea is that assets with limited supply, like Bitcoin (capped at 21 million coins), are inherently deflationary or disinflationary by design, contrasting sharply with fiat currencies which can be printed indefinitely by central banks. While the crypto market is known for its volatility, many investors see assets like Bitcoin as a form of ‘digital gold’ – a store of value that holds its purchasing power over the long term, especially as traditional currencies lose value due to inflationary pressures. This perspective is gaining traction as global inflation persists. What Does This Mean for the Average Person? Brian Armstrong’s message isn’t just for economists or crypto enthusiasts. It has implications for everyone. As global debt rises and inflation eats away at savings, understanding alternatives becomes increasingly important. The crypto benefits discussed aren’t just theoretical; they offer practical ways for individuals to protect their wealth, participate in the global economy, and gain a degree of financial independence. Whether it’s exploring cryptocurrencies as a small part of a diversified savings strategy or using crypto for faster, cheaper international remittances, the opportunities presented by this technology are becoming harder to ignore in the current economic climate. Conclusion: Crypto’s Growing Role in a Challenging World Brian Armstrong’s statement serves as a potent reminder of the foundational problems that cryptocurrency was created to address. In a world grappling with mounting debt, persistent inflation, and concerns about economic freedom, the case for why the World needs crypto becomes compelling. The unique features of decentralization, permissionless access, and transparency offer tangible crypto benefits that can empower individuals and provide alternatives to traditional financial systems facing significant stress. As the global economic landscape continues to evolve, the role of Economic freedom crypto enables, and the potential of Crypto and inflation hedging will likely become even more significant, validating the perspective shared by the Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong .

2025-06-21T07:49:20,"Solana Price Analysis: Analysts Say SOL ETF Approval Is “Near-Lock” – What Does This Mean for the $200 Target?","Solana (SOL) is back in the spotlight as Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas now estimate a 90% chance of a Solana spot ETF being approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before year-end. According to their June 21 research note, the question is no longer “if,” but “when.” The momentum behind crypto ETFs has surged since Bitcoin and Ethereum funds made their debut on Wall Street. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust alone gathered over $70 billion in assets under management, faster than any ETF in history. NEW: @EricBalchunas & I are raising our odds for the vast majority of the spot crypto ETF filings to 90% or higher. Engagement from the SEC is a very positive sign in our opinion pic.twitter.com/5dh8G8rK6Y — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 20, 2025 With crypto legitimacy rising in D.C., the SEC has shown a willingness to engage with altcoin ETF filings, including updated S-1 forms from Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, and VanEck. Solana is seen as a frontrunner due to its market depth, developer traction, and now, staking-enabled ETF proposals. If approved, these ETFs wouldn’t just track SOL, they’d also stake held tokens, generating additional yield for investors. What a Solana ETF Could Mean for Price Institutional investors gaining direct access to Solana could dramatically shift market dynamics. According to Brian Rudick, Chief Strategy Officer at Solana-focused Upexi, top-tier altcoin ETFs, such as SOL, are likely to see strong inflows post-launch, similar to Bitcoin’s explosive run after its ETF debut. “Spot ETFs were the main reason Bitcoin more than doubled after BlackRock filed in mid-2023,” Rudick said. A comparable demand shock for Solana could ignite a similar rally. If history repeats itself, ETF-driven inflows could propel SOL toward the $200 mark, especially if market sentiment and macroeconomic tailwinds align. Analysts also point to the CFTC’s futures approval for SOL as another positive signal, which reinforces market maturity and regulatory openness toward the asset. Price Faces Technical Hurdles Before Breakout Despite ETF optimism, Solana’s short-term technicals remain bearish. At $140.40, SOL is struggling below the key resistance zone between $144.49 and $145.49, aligned with a descending trendline and the 50-period EMA. SOL is stuck below key resistance at $144.49–$145.49, with a bearish engulfing candle and MACD in the red. If $138.39 support breaks, eyes on $135.74 and $132.57 next. #Solana #Crypto #SOL #TechnicalAnalysis pic.twitter.com/UTWYK9JnOA — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) June 21, 2025 A bearish engulfing candle followed the last failed breakout attempt, sending the token into a consolidation phase just above support at $138.39. The MACD indicator remains in bearish territory, suggesting continued downside risk unless SOL reclaims the $145 zone. Should support at $138.39 give way, price could drop toward $135.74 or even $132.57. Solana Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Key Takeaways: Bloomberg pegs SOL ETF approval odds at 95% ETF issuers include Grayscale, Fidelity, VanEck Staking-enabled ETFs could boost investor yield SOL must break $145.49 to regain bullish momentum Downside levels to watch: $138.39, $135.74, $132.57 Outlook: ETF approval is a long-term catalyst ; however, for short-term Solana price prediction , traders should watch for a confirmed breakout above $145 to signal a bullish continuation. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.2M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers In addition to Solana, with BTC trading near $104K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,249,360 out of its $8,290,897 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.00257 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 58% APY staking pool holding over 1.81 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income. With just hours left and the hard cap nearly reached, momentum is building fast. BTCBULL ’s blend of Bitcoin-linked value, scarcity mechanics, and flexible staking is fueling strong demand. Early buyers have a limited time to enter before the next pricing tier activates.

2025-06-21T07:36:17,"Elon Musk Is Building a DEX on Twitter—What This Means for Crypto","The post Elon Musk Is Building a DEX on Twitter—What This Means for Crypto appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Elon Musk is making his boldest move yet in finance. The visionary billionaire behind Tesla and SpaceX is now transforming X —formerly Twitter—into a decentralized finance powerhouse. If successful, Musk could deliver the Western version of WeChat, combining social media, investing, payments, and crypto all in one app. X to Launch Its Own Decentralized Exchange (DEX) According to a recent post on X by crypto researcher Atlas , the platform is quietly developing into a full-fledged financial ecosystem. Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, confirmed that in-app investing, tipping, and payments are already in the pipeline. These features will be part of X Money , a new digital finance platform currently in limited beta testing, with a broader rollout expected in 2025. One major highlight? Visa is now an official partner of X’s upcoming DEX. Why Musk’s Super App Vision Could Be a Game-Changer Musk’s ultimate goal is to replicate WeChat’s super app model—but in the West. WeChat dominates in China by combining messaging, payments, e-commerce, and even government services into one platform. By integrating a decentralized exchange, Musk gives users: Full control over their funds Censorship resistance Lower transaction fees Enhanced financial privacy Other tech giants are taking note: Meta is exploring in-app payments TikTok is pushing into e-commerce Telegram has already launched P2P crypto trading and tipping But X’s existing scale and Musk’s crypto-friendly stance could give it a major first-mover advantage. Could X Disrupt Coinbase, Robinhood, and Revolut? Atlas warns that this move could shake up the entire fintech and crypto exchange landscape. With in-app trading of stablecoins , BTC, ETH, and tokenized assets, X could replace the need for separate apps like Coinbase, Robinhood, and Revolut. While centralized exchanges like Binance, Bybit, Coinbase, OKX, and Upbit still handle more than 85% of crypto spot volume, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are rapidly growing. Top DEXs by volume today include: PancakeSwap (v2 & v3) Uniswap v2 Raydium Curve Finance The Future of Finance Will Be Cultural, Not Technical Atlas emphasizes that mass adoption won’t come from whitepapers or technical jargon—it will come from entertainment, virality, and seamless finance integration. With X already a cultural hub, Musk may be the one to trigger the next wave of crypto adoption —not with a whitepaper, but with a viral tweet. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-21T07:27:05,"Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP Prices are Down Today?","The post Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP Prices are Down Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market today is feeling the weight of macroeconomic and geopolitical risks. Successively, the valuation of the industry has dropped to $3.2 trillion, with a 1.10% decline in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the 24-hour trading volume has surged over 42% to hit $114.74 billion, signaling heightened volatility and possibly panic-led sell-offs. Amidst the ruckus, the Fear & Greed Index has moved to 43, placing the market in the neutral zone. Rising tensions in the Middle East and uncertainties around the potential restoration of Trump-era trade policies are spooking both traditional and digital asset investors. Let’s take a closer look at how this is impacting Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction: Can It Hold Above $102k? Bitcoin price today is at $103,491, down 0.94% in the past 24 hours. The daily low sits at $102,372, suggesting that the price is hovering dangerously close to key support levels. The 38% uptick in 24-hour volume to $50.25B indicates aggressive intraday trading, but not necessarily bullish accumulation. If BTC fails to maintain support at $102,000, a further slide toward $100,000 or even $98,500 is highly likely. However, if the market finds temporary relief and BTC reclaims $105,000, a short-term recovery toward $107,000–$108,000 may be on the cards. Curious about BTC’s year-end target? Read our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction: $2,400 or $2,300 First? Ethereum is bearing the brunt of today’s drop, plunging 3.59% to $2,423.62. The altcoin has seen its daily trading volume crash by over 76%, now at $21.59 billion. With a daily low of $2,371, ETH is testing a crucial demand zone. If it breaks below $2,370, the next key support lies around $2,300, followed by $2,200. It is worth noting that to initiate a recovery, ETH must climb back above $2,500. That being said, a push beyond $2,570 could invalidate short-term bearish setups and open a route toward $2,650. Hodling ETH? Check out our Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 Now! XRP Price Prediction: Is a Drop Below $2 Next? XRP price has slipped 1.16% over the past 24 hours to trade at $2.12, with a low of $2.09. Despite the modest drop compared to ETH, the volume has surged 45.9% to $2.49 billion, which I believe, that larger holders are offloading positions. If bearish pressure intensifies, XRP may retest $2.00, a support that could give way to a drop toward $1.90. Contrarily, reclaiming $2.18 could spark a minor relief rally toward $2.30. Curious about XRP’s future returns? Read our Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 Now! FAQs Why is the Bitcoin price falling today? Bitcoin is reacting to macroeconomic uncertainty, including tensions in the Middle East and fears surrounding potential Trump-era policy rollbacks. Will Ethereum fall below $2,300? Given the sharp volume decline and price weakness, Ethereum could test the $2,300–$2,200 range if the bulls don’t step in soon. Is XRP expected to drop below $2? If current bearish momentum continues, XRP could slide below $2, targeting $1.90 as the next major support.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-ethereum-xrp-prices-going-low-today/,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare

2025-06-21T07:24:06,"This Altcoin-Related Company Could Sign a Major Deal with Reddit, One of the Largest Social Media Platforms","Reddit, one of the largest social media platforms in the world, may open a new page in its user verification processes. It has emerged that the company is considering using the eye-scan-based World ID system developed by Tools for Humanity, co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. This is also a system that is linked to the World (WLD) altcoin. The ongoing talks between Reddit and Tools for Humanity could pave the way for users on the platform to both remain anonymous and prove they are human, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The talks have gained momentum amid the rise of fake content generated by artificial intelligence online and the emergence of age-verification laws for social media in several countries. Related News: Two Companies Announce Bitcoin Purchase Strategy - Here's How Much They Plan to Buy Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said last month that due to AI-based threats and age verification regulations, the company will have to determine whether users are human and of a certain age. Huffman said that they will work with third-party providers to avoid collecting user data: “We will work to preserve both the humanity and anonymity of Reddit.” The World ID is created with unique biometric data obtained from a user’s iris. This data is fragmented and stored on secret servers in different parts of the world. The system allows users to prove that they are a unique individual without revealing their identity. The identity verification process is completed with a World ID stored encrypted on the user’s phone. As a reward, users are given WLD tokens. *This is not investment advice.
