2025-06-21T12:40:59,"Texas Enacts Crucial Law Safeguarding Bitcoin Reserves","BitcoinWorld Texas Enacts Crucial Law Safeguarding Bitcoin Reserves The Lone Star State is making waves in the digital asset space! Texas Governor Greg Abbott has taken a significant step, signing legislation that directly impacts how the state handles potential Bitcoin reserves . This move highlights Texas’s growing interest in and support for the cryptocurrency sector. What Does HB 4488 Mean for Texas Bitcoin Holdings? Governor Greg Abbott recently enacted House Bill 4488, a piece of legislation that brings important protections for specific state funds. At its core, HB 4488 is designed to prevent designated state funds from being automatically transferred into general revenue. Why is this significant for digital assets? According to reports, this protection explicitly extends to any Bitcoin reserves or other digital asset holdings that might be established outside of the traditional state treasury framework. This provides a layer of security and stability for potential state-held digital assets, ensuring they aren’t subject to routine sweeps into the general state budget. Here are the key takeaways from HB 4488: Fund Protection: Prevents designated state funds from being swept into general revenue. Digital Asset Inclusion: Explicitly includes digital asset holdings, such as Texas Bitcoin reserves, established outside the main treasury. Increased Security: Offers a degree of stability and protection for these specific digital asset holdings. This legislative action signals a proactive approach from Texas in creating a framework that acknowledges and potentially accommodates digital assets within its financial structure. Will Texas Soon Be Buying Bitcoin? Exploring Senate Bill 21 While HB 4488 is now law, the fate of another crucial piece of legislation, Senate Bill 21 (SB 21), remains undecided by Governor Greg Abbott Bitcoin policy actions are being closely watched, and SB 21 could represent an even bolder step. SB 21 proposes permitting the state to purchase digital assets. However, it includes a significant condition: the state would only be allowed to acquire digital assets with a market capitalization of at least $500 billion. Currently, only Bitcoin consistently meets this substantial market cap requirement. If signed into law, SB 21 could pave the way for Texas to become a direct holder of Bitcoin, potentially adding it to state investment portfolios or reserves. This would be a landmark move, positioning Texas at the forefront of state-level digital asset adoption in the U.S. Comparing the two bills: HB 4488 (Signed): Focus: Protecting *existing or future* digital asset holdings (like Bitcoin reserves ) held *outside* the treasury from general fund sweeps. Action: Defensive/Protective measure for digital assets. Impact: Creates a safer environment for state entities considering or holding digital assets outside the traditional treasury. SB 21 (Pending): Focus: Enabling the state to *purchase* digital assets meeting a high market cap threshold ($500B+). Action: Offensive/Acquisition measure for digital assets (specifically Bitcoin, given the threshold). Impact: Could potentially make Texas a direct investor in Bitcoin. The decision on SB 21 is highly anticipated, as it could significantly alter the landscape for Texas crypto bill initiatives. Why is Texas Embracing Digital Assets? Texas has positioned itself as a friendly environment for the cryptocurrency industry, attracting miners, blockchain companies, and innovators. This legislative push, including HB 4488 and the consideration of SB 21, aligns with that broader strategy. Several factors likely contribute to this stance: Economic Development: Attracting crypto businesses creates jobs and stimulates economic activity. Innovation Hub: Aiming to be a leader in emerging technologies. Diversification: Exploring alternative assets for state funds (as potentially allowed by SB 21). Property Rights: Framing digital asset ownership within existing property rights frameworks. Governor Greg Abbott Bitcoin -related actions are seen by many in the crypto community as a positive signal, indicating governmental recognition and support for the asset class. Benefits and Implications of the Texas Crypto Bill The enactment of HB 4488 and the potential passage of SB 21 carry significant implications: Benefits: Increased Legitimacy: State-level action lends credibility to Bitcoin and other digital assets. Attracting Investment: A clear legal framework encourages more crypto businesses and investors to come to Texas. Potential State Asset Diversification: SB 21 could open doors for diversifying state holdings with an uncorrelated asset like Bitcoin. Setting a Precedent: Texas’s actions could influence other states to explore similar legislation regarding Bitcoin reserves and digital asset ownership. Potential Challenges/Considerations: Regulatory Uncertainty: While Texas is acting, the federal regulatory landscape remains complex. Market Volatility: Holding volatile assets like Bitcoin carries risks, which would need careful management if SB 21 passes. Custody and Security: Managing state-held digital assets requires robust security and custody solutions. The Texas crypto bill landscape is evolving rapidly, and these recent developments are key indicators of the state’s direction. Actionable Insights for Readers What does this mean for you, whether you’re a crypto holder, investor, or simply interested in the space? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on state-level legislative developments, not just federal ones. Texas is a significant player. Understand the Nuances: Differentiate between protective bills like HB 4488 (safeguarding existing/future holdings) and enabling bills like SB 21 (allowing purchase). Observe Trends: Texas’s actions are part of a broader trend of increasing institutional and governmental interest in digital assets. The actions taken by Greg Abbott Bitcoin and crypto-related legislation in Texas provide valuable insights into how traditional governance structures are beginning to interact with decentralized technologies. Conclusion: Texas Solidifies Its Pro-Crypto Stance Governor Greg Abbott’s signing of HB 4488 is a concrete step by Texas to provide a protective legal foundation for digital assets, including potential Bitcoin reserves held outside the traditional treasury. While the decision on SB 21, which could enable direct state investment in Bitcoin, is still pending, the direction is clear: Texas aims to be a leader in the digital asset space. This Texas crypto bill activity not only supports the state’s growing crypto industry but also signals to the broader market that digital assets are increasingly being considered within established financial and governmental frameworks. As the landscape continues to evolve, Texas’s legislative actions will remain a key area to watch.

2025-06-21T12:30:55,"Peter Schiff Issues Warning on USD Stablecoins, Favors Gold","BitcoinWorld Peter Schiff Issues Warning on USD Stablecoins, Favors Gold Well-known economist and outspoken crypto skeptic, Peter Schiff , has once again stirred the pot in the cryptocurrency world, this time setting his sights on USD stablecoins . While Schiff is famously critical of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, his recent comments highlight a specific concern regarding digital assets pegged to traditional fiat currency like the U.S. dollar. Peter Schiff’s Skepticism: Why Question USD Stablecoins? In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Peter Schiff , who serves as Chief Economist at Euro Pacific Asset Management, articulated his doubts about the fundamental value proposition of USD stablecoins . His core argument centers on the backing asset itself – the U.S. dollar. Schiff has long been a critic of government-issued fiat currencies, particularly the dollar, citing concerns about inflation, devaluation, and government debt. His skepticism towards USD stablecoins stems directly from this view. He questions why investors would opt for a digital asset whose stability is tied to a currency he believes is inherently flawed and subject to losing purchasing power over time. According to CoinDesk’s report on his comments, Schiff believes that choosing a digital asset pegged to a depreciating asset (in his view, the dollar) makes little sense when alternatives backed by what he considers a superior store of value, like gold, are available. Understanding Stablecoins: Beyond the Fiat Peg To appreciate Schiff’s perspective, it helps to understand what stablecoins are and how they function. At their heart, stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to minimize price volatility, unlike assets such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. They achieve this stability by pegging their market value to another, more stable asset. The most common type are fiat currency -backed stablecoins , where each digital token is supposedly backed by an equivalent reserve of traditional currency (like USD, EUR, etc.) held in a bank account. Examples include Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), which aim to maintain a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar. Other types of stablecoins exist: Crypto-backed stablecoins: Over-collateralized with other cryptocurrencies (e.g., Dai). Algorithmic stablecoins: Use complex algorithms and smart contracts to maintain price stability without direct asset backing (these have proven highly volatile and risky). Commodity-backed stablecoins: Pegged to assets like gold, oil, or real estate. Schiff’s focus is specifically on the first category, the USD stablecoins , which he sees as inheriting the weaknesses of the underlying fiat asset. The Allure of Gold-Backed Stablecoins Given his long-standing advocacy for gold as a reliable store of value, it’s unsurprising that Peter Schiff sees gold-backed stablecoins as a more sensible alternative. Unlike fiat, gold has a history spanning millennia as a medium of exchange and a store of wealth, largely independent of government policies. Gold-backed stablecoins aim to combine the stability associated with gold with the benefits of blockchain technology – ease of transfer, divisibility, and potential transparency (depending on the specific implementation and auditing). Each token in a gold-backed stablecoin system is typically claimed to represent a specific amount of physical gold held in secure vaults. Schiff himself acknowledged the existence of such offerings and, in response to a user suggestion, even stated his intention to potentially launch his own gold-backed stablecoin . This move would align his digital asset strategy with his core economic philosophy, offering investors a digital way to hold an asset tied to physical gold rather than a fiat currency he distrusts. Benefits Highlighted by Gold Advocates: Store of Value: Gold is historically seen as preserving purchasing power over long periods, unlike inflationary fiat currencies. Hedge Against Inflation/Devaluation: Gold tends to perform well during times of economic uncertainty or currency devaluation. Tangible Backing: Represents ownership in a physical asset, not just a claim on fiat reserves. Accessibility: Offers a potentially easier and more divisible way to invest in gold compared to buying physical bars or coins. Challenges for Gold-Backed Stablecoins: Custody and Auditing: Ensuring the physical gold actually exists and is securely stored requires robust auditing and trust. Liquidity: May not be as liquid or widely accepted for transactions as major USD stablecoins . Fees: Storage, insurance, and management fees for the physical gold can impact the token’s value or incur costs. Regulatory Uncertainty: Like all cryptocurrencies, they face evolving regulatory landscapes. Fiat Currency: The Foundation Schiff Questions The heart of Peter Schiff’s critique lies in his fundamental distrust of modern fiat currency systems. Fiat money, like the U.S. dollar, is not backed by a physical commodity (like gold) but by the full faith and credit of the government that issues it. Its value is derived from government decree and public trust. Schiff and others in the Austrian economics tradition argue that central banks’ ability to print money and governments’ tendency to run deficits inevitably lead to inflation, eroding the purchasing power of fiat currency over time. This makes assets denominated in or pegged to fiat, like USD stablecoins , susceptible to the same devaluation. From this perspective, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar is only as stable as the dollar itself. If the dollar loses 10% of its value due to inflation, the USD stablecoin , maintaining its 1:1 peg, also effectively loses 10% of its purchasing power relative to goods and services. Navigating the Stablecoin Landscape: Insights for Investors Peter Schiff’s comments highlight a critical debate within the digital asset space: what makes a stable digital asset truly ‘stable’ or valuable in the long term? For investors, this raises important considerations: Actionable Insights: Understand the Backing: Don’t just see ‘stablecoin’; investigate what asset it is pegged to and how that peg is maintained (reserves, algorithms, etc.). Assess the Underlying Asset: Consider the stability and long-term prospects of the asset backing the stablecoin (Is it a fiat currency you trust? A commodity? Another crypto?). Evaluate Reserve Transparency and Audits: Especially for fiat or commodity-backed stablecoins, look for clear, regular, and independent audits of the reserves. Consider Your Goals: Are you using stablecoins for short-term trading liquidity (where USD stablecoins are dominant) or as a long-term store of value (where gold-backed stablecoins might appeal to those sharing Schiff’s view)? Diversification: As with any investment, don’t put all your eggs in one basket, whether it’s one type of stablecoin or just stablecoins in general. Stay Informed on Regulation: The regulatory environment for all types of stablecoins is rapidly evolving, which can impact their availability and stability. While USD stablecoins currently dominate the market due to their deep liquidity and ease of use within the crypto ecosystem, Schiff’s arguments serve as a reminder that their perceived stability is intrinsically linked to the health and future of the U.S. dollar itself. Alternatives like gold-backed stablecoins offer a different value proposition, appealing to those seeking digital exposure to assets historically viewed as hedges against fiat currency instability. Conclusion: The Ongoing Debate Over Digital Stability Peter Schiff’s skepticism towards USD stablecoins is a natural extension of his long-held views on fiat currency and the enduring value of gold. He challenges the fundamental premise of pegging a digital asset to a currency he sees as prone to devaluation, advocating instead for the stability offered by gold-backed stablecoins . This debate is crucial for the future of digital assets. While USD stablecoins currently serve vital functions in the crypto market, the discussion around alternative backing assets like gold highlights different philosophies on what constitutes true, long-term stability in a digital format. Investors must look beyond the ‘stable’ label and understand the underlying mechanics and assets that give a stablecoin its value, considering whether they trust the future of fiat currency or prefer assets with a longer history as a store of wealth.

2025-06-21T12:30:19,"Bitcoin Net Taker Volume Enters Deep Red On Binance — What’s Next For BTC Price?","After another strong play for its all-time high in the past week, the price of Bitcoin has struggled to build on its recent bullish momentum. Over the last few days, the premier cryptocurrency has been specifically slow and lethargic. On Friday, June 20, the Bitcoin price took a severe hit — together with the rest of the crypto market — and fell briefly beneath the $103,000 mark. However, the latest market data suggests that the price of BTC might enjoy some stability after the recent round of long liquidations. BTC Gearing For A Run Of ‘Healthier Price Action’: Analyst In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, on-chain analyst Amr Taha explained the dynamics between the Bitcoin price and its recent long liquidation event. According to the online pundit, the market leader could be preparing for more stable price action over the next few weeks. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Gearing Up for a Breakout? On-Chain Signals Say ‘Watch This Level’ Taha revealed that the critical $103,000 liquidation cluster, which held a large volume of overleveraged long positions on Binance, has been cleared off. This cascade of long liquidations came after the price of Bitcoin plunged toward the $102,500 level on Friday evening. According to data from CryptoQuant, the price decline caused the long liquidations on Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume, to exceed $160 million. The on-chain analyst noted that this long liquidation event also coincided with a major change in the Bitcoin Net Taker Volume on the cryptocurrency exchange. Taha highlighted that the Net Taker Volume has moved deep into the negative territory, falling to nearly -$100 million in the past day. As observed in the chart below, this latest plunge marks the third time the Net taker Volume has fallen to this level in the month of June. According to Taha, the change in this metric suggests that aggressive selling outweighed buying activity during the liquidation event. The on-chain analyst outlines two possible reasons for this trend, including that long positions were forced to close, pushing sell orders into the market as the Bitcoin price fell below $103,000. Taha added that some sections of Bitcoin retail traders might have pushed the panic button and filled new sell orders in fear of further losses. In the end, the crypto analyst concluded that the combination of long liquidations and extremely negative Net Taker Volume might not be completely bad for the flagship cryptocurrency. Taha said: While such events often feel devastating in the moment, they lay the groundwork for healthier price action. Given these dynamics, the path of least resistance may now shift upward as Bitcoin stabilizes above key support levels with reduced leverage overhead. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $103,450, reflecting an over 1% decline in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Gearing Up for a Breakout?

2025-06-21T12:30:00,"Ethereum holds the line: ETF inflows slow, yet bullish setup forms","Ethereum price remained inside a tight range this week as inflows into its exchange-traded funds slowed. Ethereum ( ETH ) dropped to a low of $2,400 this week as the crypto market crash continued. Its lowest level was down by 16% from its highest level this month, meaning it is in a technical correction. SoSoValue data shows that spot Ethereum ETFs added $40 million in inflows this week, down from $528 million a week earlier. It was the smallest increase since the week of May 16. There are two likely reasons for the significant drop in ETF inflows. First, these inflows slowed as investors remained in the sidelines as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies dropped. You might also like: Staked ETH eclipses 35m as crypto reserves fuel supply squeeze Second, inflows slowed this week because it had four working days in the US. Markets were closed on Thursday, which was Juneteenth, a federal holiday. On the positive side, Ethereum ETFs have had inflows in the last six consecutive weeks, the longest streak since their approval in September last year. The cumulative ETF inflows is $3.89 billion, bringing the total assets in these funds to $9.6 billion. BlackRock’s ETHA ETF had cumulative inflows of $5.28 billion, while Fidelity’s FETH has $1.1 billion. Ethereum price retreated as its ecosystem metrics deteriorated. For example, the stablecoin transaction volume in Ethereum has dropped by 31% in the last 30 days to $1.2 trillion. Ethereum price technical analysis ETH price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the Ethereum price has moved sideways since May 10. It has remained inside the support and resistance levels at $2,410 and $2,736. This consolidation is part of the formation of the bullish flag. This pattern consists of a vertical price increase driven by strong demand and a short-term consolidation. The bullish flag occurs between the 50% and 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement levels. It also occurs after the coin rises above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages. Therefore, the coin will likely have a strong bullish breakout as long as it remains above the lower side of the flag at $2,400. More gains will be confirmed if the price moves above the upper side of the flag at $2,735. If this happens, the next point to watch will be the psychological point at $3,000.

2025-06-21T12:20:48,"Urgent Alert: Altcoin Season Index Plunges to 19, Signaling Bitcoin Dominance","BitcoinWorld Urgent Alert: Altcoin Season Index Plunges to 19, Signaling Bitcoin Dominance Are you wondering why your favorite altcoins might not be performing as well as Bitcoin lately? The latest data from the Altcoin Season Index provides a clear answer, pointing towards a significant shift in the crypto market landscape. Understanding the Alt coin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool for cryptocurrency investors and traders. Tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), it offers insight into whether the broader market is favoring altcoins or Bitcoin over a specific period. This index helps gauge market sentiment and identify potential trends. Here’s how the index fundamentally works: It analyzes the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CMC. Stablecoins and wrapped tokens are excluded from the calculation to provide a clearer picture of speculative asset performance. The performance of each of these top 100 coins is compared against Bitcoin ‘s performance over the past 90 days. The index score ranges from 1 to 100. The threshold for determining market season is based on how many of these top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin : Altcoin Season: Occurs when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index score is typically high (above 75). Bitcoin Season: Occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index score is typically low (25 or below). Scores between 26 and 74 generally indicate a neutral or transitional market phase. Why the Altcoin Season Index at 19 Matters As of June 21, at 00:38 UTC, the Altcoin Season Index registered a score of 19. This figure is down three points from the previous day. A score of 19 falls squarely into the definition of Bitcoin Season . This low number signals that a significant majority of the top 100 altcoins have failed to keep pace with, let alone outperform, Bitcoin over the recent 90-day period. This shift isn’t just a number; it reflects capital flows and investor preference. During a Bitcoin Season , investors tend to favor the perceived safety and dominance of Bitcoin , often rotating capital out of smaller, more volatile altcoins . This can lead to Bitcoin seeing stronger price gains or holding its value better during downturns compared to the rest of the crypto market . Navigating the Current Bitcoin Season in the Crypto Market Being in a Bitcoin Season presents both challenges and opportunities for participants in the crypto market . For those holding a diversified portfolio heavily weighted towards altcoins , this period can be frustrating as their holdings may underperform relative to Bitcoin . Challenges during Bitcoin Season: Altcoin Underperformance: Most altcoins will struggle to gain ground against Bitcoin . Increased Volatility for Altcoins: Smaller cap altcoins can experience sharper drops when Bitcoin corrects or consolidates. Lower Trading Volume for Altcoins: Interest and capital can consolidate around Bitcoin , leading to less liquidity in some altcoin markets. Opportunities during Bitcoin Season: Potential for Bitcoin Accumulation: Investors focused on accumulating Bitcoin may find relative strength. Identifying Resilient Altcoins: Some altcoins may show relative strength even during Bitcoin Season , potentially indicating strong fundamentals or specific catalysts. Strategic Positioning: Understanding the current market phase allows investors to adjust their strategies, perhaps increasing Bitcoin exposure or waiting for the market to signal a potential shift back towards altcoins . What Does This Mean for Your Altcoins ? If you hold altcoins , the current Bitcoin Season means you should temper expectations regarding their short-term performance relative to Bitcoin . It doesn’t necessarily mean all altcoins will lose value, but their gains are likely to lag significantly behind Bitcoin ‘s, or they may even see declines while Bitcoin remains relatively stable or rises. Consider reviewing your portfolio: Diversification: Is your portfolio overly exposed to smaller altcoins ? Risk Tolerance: Are you comfortable with the increased volatility that altcoins might experience during this phase? Long-Term View: For projects you believe in long-term, periods of underperformance against Bitcoin can sometimes present accumulation opportunities, but caution is advised as further drops are possible. This phase underscores Bitcoin ‘s continued dominance and its role as the primary driver of overall market sentiment and capital movement. While the dream of massive, quick gains in small altcoins is often associated with Altcoin Season , the current data indicates we are in a different part of the market cycle. Conclusion: Staying Informed in the Crypto Market The Altcoin Season Index at 19 serves as a clear indicator that the crypto market is currently experiencing Bitcoin Season . This phase is characterized by Bitcoin ‘s relative strength and the underperformance of most altcoins . Understanding this market dynamic is crucial for making informed decisions. While market cycles can shift rapidly, the data suggests caution for aggressive altcoin plays and highlights the importance of monitoring Bitcoin ‘s performance. Keeping an eye on the Altcoin Season Index and other market indicators will be key to identifying potential shifts back towards a more favorable environment for altcoins in the future.

2025-06-21T12:10:44,"Bitcoin Open Interest Hits $96B: A Powerful Catalyst for Price Action","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Open Interest Hits $96B: A Powerful Catalyst for Price Action Hey there, crypto enthusiasts! Let’s dive into some exciting news straight from the Bitcoin market. We’re talking about a significant metric that’s been making waves: Bitcoin open interest . This figure has recently hit a staggering $96 billion, a level that has analysts buzzing about what could be next for the Bitcoin price . Understanding open interest is key to grasping market sentiment and potential future movements. It represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures or options, that have not yet been settled. A rising open interest, especially when paired with a rising price, is often seen as a bullish signal, indicating fresh money entering the market and increased conviction among traders. What’s Driving This Record Bitcoin Open Interest? According to insights shared by Cointelegraph and data from Glassnode, a major catalyst behind this surge is the introduction of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. These exchange-traded funds have opened up a new avenue for both institutional and retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. This influx of capital into the ecosystem naturally translates to higher activity in related derivatives markets, pushing open interest figures to new heights. Think of it this way: as more large players and traditional investors enter the space via ETFs, they often use derivatives for hedging, speculation, or complex trading strategies. This increased participation adds to the total number of open contracts, inflating the overall open interest number we’re seeing today. Exploring the Realized Cap Leverage Ratio Beyond just the raw open interest number, another crucial metric is the realized cap leverage ratio. Glassnode data indicates this ratio has climbed to 10.2%. Now, what does that mean in plain English? The realized cap leverage ratio compares the total open interest to the realized capitalization of Bitcoin. Realized cap values each Bitcoin at the price it was last moved on-chain. It’s often seen as a more accurate measure of the network’s true value held by long-term holders compared to market capitalization, which uses the current price for all coins. A higher realized cap leverage ratio suggests that the amount of capital tied up in derivatives is significant relative to the underlying ‘realized’ value of Bitcoin held by investors. The current level of 10.2% places it in the top 10.8% of trading days since 2018. This historical context is important – it tells us that while not unprecedented, the current level of leverage in the system is relatively high compared to most periods over the last six years. Why Does High Leverage Matter for the Bitcoin Price? High crypto leverage can be a double-edged sword: Bullish Potential: When the market is moving upwards, high leverage amplifies gains. Traders with leveraged long positions profit significantly from small price increases, potentially adding fuel to the rally as positions stay open or are added to. The large pool of open interest can act as potential buying pressure if these leveraged long positions are confident and maintain their exposure. Increased Risk: This is where the other edge cuts. High leverage means positions are more sensitive to price swings. A sudden downturn can quickly lead to margin calls and forced liquidations. The Shadow of Liquidation Risk While high open interest and leverage can certainly boost upside potential for the Bitcoin price , they also significantly heighten the risk of cascading liquidations. This is a critical challenge to consider in the current market environment. Here’s how liquidation risk works: Traders open leveraged positions (e.g., betting on the price going up using borrowed funds). If the price moves against their position (e.g., starts to fall), their margin (collateral) can become insufficient to cover potential losses. Exchanges automatically close these positions to prevent losses exceeding the margin. This forced selling is a ‘liquidation’. A large number of liquidations happening rapidly can create a domino effect, pushing the price down further, triggering more liquidations, and leading to sharp, rapid declines – often called a ‘long squeeze’ if it’s primarily leveraged long positions being closed. Given the current high leverage levels, the market is arguably more susceptible to such a cascade event. A relatively modest price drop could potentially trigger a wave of selling pressure from forced liquidations, accelerating the decline. Putting It All Together: What Does This Mean for the Market? The surge in Bitcoin open interest to $96 billion, supported by the structural shift brought by Bitcoin ETFs and reflected in a high realized cap leverage ratio, paints a complex picture for the Bitcoin market . Key Insights: Increased Market Participation: The high open interest signals strong engagement from traders, likely fueled by new capital entering through ETFs. Potential for Volatility: The high leverage means that while upward movements could be amplified, the risk of sharp downward corrections due to liquidations is also elevated. Historical Context: While leverage is high relative to recent years, it’s important to compare it to previous market cycle peaks. Are we at levels seen just before major corrections, or is this a new paradigm driven by institutional entry? This requires careful analysis. Bullish Fuel vs. Bearish Trigger: The large pool of open contracts can act as potential buying power on dips or add momentum to rallies. However, it simultaneously represents a large pool of potentially vulnerable positions that could trigger a sell-off if the market turns. Actionable Insights: Manage Risk: Traders using leverage should be acutely aware of the increased liquidation risk . Setting stop-losses and managing position sizes are more critical than ever. Monitor Funding Rates: Positive funding rates in perpetual futures often indicate a bias towards long positions, which can increase the risk of a long squeeze if sentiment shifts. Watch for Price Catalysts: Given the coiled spring nature of a highly leveraged market, positive or negative news events could have amplified effects on the Bitcoin price . Long-Term View: For investors with a longer time horizon, short-term volatility driven by leverage might present buying opportunities, but understanding the potential for sharp drops is crucial. Comparing Leverage Levels: Is This Unprecedented? While the 10.2% realized cap leverage ratio is in the top 10.8% of trading days since 2018, it’s worth looking at historical peaks to gauge the potential impact. Previous periods of extremely high leverage have sometimes preceded significant price corrections. However, the market structure has also evolved significantly with the advent of spot ETFs and increased institutional participation. This makes direct comparisons challenging, but the historical data serves as a warning about the inherent risks of high leverage in any market. A table illustrating historical leverage peaks vs. current levels could be useful here, though creating a precise, dynamic table without live data is difficult. Conceptually, imagine columns for ‘Date’, ‘Realized Cap Leverage Ratio’, and ‘Subsequent Price Action (e.g., % change in next 30 days)’. This would visually highlight the correlation between high leverage and potential volatility. The Role of Bitcoin ETFs in Shaping Open Interest The launch of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs didn’t just bring new direct investment; it also integrated Bitcoin more deeply into traditional financial structures. This integration often involves the use of derivatives for various purposes, including: Hedging: Institutions holding physical Bitcoin (or equivalents via ETFs) might use futures or options to hedge against potential price drops. Arbitrage: Traders might exploit small price differences between the spot ETF price and futures prices using leveraged positions. Structured Products: The creation of more complex financial products built around Bitcoin can also contribute to derivative activity and open interest. This structural change suggests that a higher baseline of Bitcoin open interest might be the new normal compared to pre-ETF days, but the risks associated with high leverage still apply. Concluding Thoughts: Navigating the Leveraged Landscape The current state of Bitcoin open interest , sitting near record highs at $96 billion and accompanied by elevated crypto leverage , presents a fascinating and potentially volatile market scenario. The bullish narrative is strong, fueled by continued ETF inflows and positive sentiment, suggesting the potential for further upward movement in the Bitcoin price . However, the significant level of leverage simultaneously introduces substantial liquidation risk . A sudden market shock could trigger a rapid unwinding of positions, leading to a sharp price decline. For participants in the Bitcoin market , this environment demands careful attention to risk management. While the potential rewards are significant if the market continues its upward trajectory, the potential for rapid downside moves should not be underestimated.

2025-06-21T12:05:08,"Raoul Pal Says Current Crypto Market Echoes 2017, Eyes Extended Bull Cycle into 2026","Crypto markets may be in the early stages of a longer-than-expected bull cycle, according to Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal. In a video released Thursday, Pal compared the current market structure to that of 2017, when Bitcoin steadily climbed throughout the year before exploding in value by December. He noted that while the pattern is “spookily similar,” macroeconomic factors suggest this cycle could extend further — potentially into 2026. Pal bases his forecast on his “business cycle score,” a macroeconomic model used to assess where the global economy stands. Currently, the score remains below 50, indicating that economic momentum is still building. “It generally takes a while to climb up,” he explained, adding that this delay could stretch the crypto bull market timeline. Weakening Dollar Points to Longer Crypto Upside Potential One of the major indicators supporting Pal’s outlook is the weakening U.S. dollar. Since January 1, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has dropped nearly 9%, now hovering around 98.77. Given the inverse correlation between crypto and the dollar , a continued decline in the greenback could further bolster Bitcoin’s appeal as both a speculative asset and a hedge against fiat devaluation. Bitcoin’s historical price data from 2017 supports Pal’s analogy. Starting the year at around $1,044, it reached $2,187 by the end of May and closed the year at $14,156 — a gain of over 1,200%. This pattern of gradual growth followed by an explosive Q4 rally mirrors what Pal sees in today’s market, although macro conditions may push the peak further out. He also noted that this cycle may resemble 2020 more than 2021, suggesting the current phase is still early in its growth curve. “The whole cycle got shifted because rates didn’t get adjusted, and the dollar moved sideways for a while,” Pal added. Middle East Bets Big on AI and Blockchain Another promising signal for the future of crypto, Pal said, comes from institutional interest in the Middle East. On a recent trip to the region, he spoke with Sovereign Wealth Funds and reported a strong, unified mandate across countries like Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, and Bahrain. “The mandate is AI and blockchain,” Pal said. He emphasized that these nations are not only interested in holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset but are also planning to build government infrastructure using blockchain technology .

Solana coin price could reach a potential high of $400 in 2025. With a potential surge, the SOL price could hit $1,351 by 2030. Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer,” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. In a recent feat, Solana Strategies has planned to raise $1 billion to boost the ecosystem. Talking about numbers, the Solana price currently trades at a discount of 51.59% from its ATH of $ 294.33. Following this, crypto investors are storming Google with questions like “Will Solana Go Back Up?” or “How high can Solana go?” and “Will SOL price reach $500 this altcoin season?” To answer more such questions, we bring to you our Solana price prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030. We’ll address these queries using our analyses, market sentiments, and regular updates from the crypto world. Table of contents Solana Price Today Solana Price Prediction for June 2025 Solana (SOL) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Solana Price Forecast 2026 SOL Price Analysis 2027 Solana Coin Price Prediction 2028 SOL Coin Price Prediction 2029 Solana Price Prediction 2030 Solana (SOL) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis FAQs Solana Price Today Cryptocurrency Solana Token SOL Price $ 141.82525085 -4.00% Market cap $ 75,321,584,948.3490 Circulating Supply 531,087,267.5944 Trading Volume $ 3,964,856,257.6111 All-time high $294.33 on 19th January 2025 All-time low $0.5052 on 12th May 2020 Solana Price Prediction for June 2025 SOL crypto price is now hovering around $142.25, after reclaiming the Bollinger Band midpoint, with support at $140 being held firm. The RSI near 40.12 hints at the lack of strong momentum for a recovery. It is worth mentioning that a breakout above $170 could trigger a rally toward the $185 to $190 resistance zone. However, a failure to hold above $150 may floor the price to $140. That being said, Solana crypto is likely to trade sideways with an inclination to the bulls until the next fortnight. Potential High: $190 Average Price Range: $165 Potential Low: $140 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the derivatives market with $6.56B in open interest, far surpassing other altcoins. The heatmap and high trader positioning signal elevated volatility ahead. Any major price move in SOL could trigger significant market reactions, making it a key token to watch in the coming sessions. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

He attributes this to Solana’s advanced blockchain technology, growing ecosystem, and rising investor interest. If Pal’s prediction holds, Solana’s price could exceed $400 in the coming months, a significant surge from its previous peak. Despite market trends, Solana has shown resilience, maintaining a strong performance with consistent buying pressure. CoinPedia’s Solana (SOL) Price Prediction With the improving network conditions of Solana and the slow but steady rise in the DeFi sector, the SOL prices project a bullish future. According to CoinPedia’s formulated Solana price prediction 2025, the price might surge to $400. On the flip side, a failure to sustain recovery will plunge Solana prices to $250 during that year.

2025-06-21T11:57:28,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Volatility Surges – What Technical Price Levels Are Traders Watching?","Bitcoin (BTC) is back under pressure, sliding beneath a critical support zone at $104,000 as short-term technical indicators signal a potential bearish continuation. At the time of writing, BTC trades around $103,829, down over 2% in the last 24 hours. With 24-hour volume surging to $46.6 billion, volatility has returned, but price action remains indecisive. On the 2-hour chart, Bitcoin is trapped beneath a descending trendline and has failed to hold the 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $104,657. A bearish engulfing candle near the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement at $104,028 was quickly followed by a drop to the $103,000 range. MACD momentum has turned negative, with widening divergence between signal and MACD lines, suggesting a deepening selloff. Key Technical Levels: Resistance: $104,657 (EMA), $105,238 (Fib 0.5) Support: $103,000, then $102,499 and $101,437 MACD: Bearish crossover confirmed A bearish Bitcoin price prediction could occur if BTC closes below $103K with high volume, potentially leading to further declines toward $100,451. Semler’s 105K Bitcoin Bet Shows Institutional Confidence While short-term price action remains cautious, institutional confidence in Bitcoin appears to be strengthening. Semler Scientific announced plans to expand its Bitcoin holdings from 4,449 to 105,000 by 2027, and appointed BTC strategist Joe Burnett to oversee the effort. BIG MOVE: Semler Scientific is going all-in on $BTC , planning to boost its holdings from 3,808 to a whopping 105,000 BTC by 2027! They aim for 10,000 BTC by year-end and 42,000 by 2026. With a 287% yield, they’re riding the corporate Bitcoin wave! #Bitcoin #Crypto — ChainGPT AI Agent (@ChainGPTAI) June 20, 2025 Even amid Friday’s broader crypto pullback, Semler’s stock jumped 14%, underscoring investor enthusiasm for long-term accumulation strategies. According to the firm, their goal is to hold 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025, setting the tone for more corporate treasuries to follow. Although BTC remained largely unmoved by the announcement, these longer-term signals of demand may lay the groundwork for future price stability above $100,000. Regulation Looms as Fraud Spurs ATM Crackdown And then there was the Bitcoin ATM news in Texas where a sheriff took $32,000 from a crypto machine to help recover $25,000 stolen in a government impersonation scam. The story went viral, and now everyone’s talking about whether this will lead to stricter regulations on Bitcoin ATMs. Jasper County sheriff recovers $32K from Bitcoin ATM after local scam, sparking debate over crypto privacy and enforcement methods. #BitcoinATM #LawEnforcement https://t.co/iqtiwD9xZH — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 20, 2025 In 2024 alone, crypto ATM fraud has resulted in $246 million in losses. While this doesn’t mean Bitcoin is the problem, tighter oversight could limit retail crypto access and slow down transaction volume for a bit. At the macro level, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said interest rate cuts could come as early as July if labor markets get weaker. Lower rates are good for risk assets like Bitcoin, but so far, BTC is waiting for more confirmation. Summary: BTC trades near $103.8K as MACD turns bearish Semler Scientific plans to accumulate 105,000 BTC Texas Bitcoin ATM raid triggers debate over retail access Fed rate cut speculation builds, but BTC holds steady As volatility climbs, traders are closely watching $103,000. A break below could set the stage for retests of $101,437 or even $100,451.

2025-06-21T11:49:20,"Nakamoto Holdings Raises $51.5M in 72 Hours to Buy More Bitcoin!","The post Nakamoto Holdings Raises $51.5M in 72 Hours to Buy More Bitcoin! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Backed by Trump’s crypto advisor David Bailey, Nakamoto Holdings has secured $51.5 million in lightning-fast funding—fueling its bold Bitcoin treasury ambitions. Investor Frenzy Sends Bitcoin Treasury Play into Overdrive Nakamoto Holdings, a rising Bitcoin treasury firm led by U.S. President Trump’s crypto advisor David Bailey, has raised $51.5 million via a PIPE (private investment in public equity) round. The deal was confirmed by merger partner KindlyMD and priced at $5.00 per share, completed in under 72 hours. “Investor interest in Nakamoto is exceptionally high,” said Bailey . “We’re staying focused on raising capital to buy as much Bitcoin as possible.” This latest round brings KindlyMD’s total funding to $563 million, and with convertible notes, the merged entity now commands $763 million in capital—setting the stage for Nakamoto’s aggressive BTC buying spree. Building a Bitcoin Treasury Powerhouse Nakamoto Holdings aims to rival giants like MicroStrategy and Europe’s Blockchain Group, which recently added $20 million in Bitcoin to its $170 million stash. The newly raised funds will primarily go toward Bitcoin acquisitions, with the remainder covering business operations.

Van de Poppe tells his 792,200 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin could soar above the $112,000 price and hit a new all-time high if BTC manages to break above the resistance level at around $108,900. “Bitcoin trending back upwards, which is a great sign.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Based on the widely followed analyst’s Bitcoin chart on the four-hour time frame, it appears Van de Poppe sees BTC witnessing a dip to the zone around $100,000 if the crypto king loses $105,500 as support. Bitcoin is trading at $105,617 at time of writing. Next up is the scaling solution Optimism ( OP ). According to the widely followed analyst and trader, Optimism has formed a bullish divergence against Bitcoin on the three-day time frame.

2025-06-21T11:30:49,"Pundit Claims BlackRock Has Two Special Dates For XRP Holders, Legal Expert Reacts","A recent claim by crypto influencer Bale has reignited speculative chatter within the XRP community after he alleged that a contact at BlackRock privately shared two key dates tied to XRP’s future. While the post was vague and lacked verifiable detail, it prompted immediate attention and skepticism from XRP holders and legal experts alike. Bale’s Bold Claim Sparks Buzz Bale’s post read: “So I met my guy from BlackRock in NYC for a coffee. He gave me 2 new XRP dates to watch. Adoption is coming.” Though not the first time the influencer has made such insinuations, this latest statement comes at a sensitive time for XRP, with heightened expectations surrounding institutional interest and regulatory clarity. The reference to “two new XRP dates” sparked a flurry of speculation among retail investors, many of whom remain hopeful that financial giants like BlackRock could eventually integrate XRP into their digital asset strategies. However, Bale offered no evidence, context, or timeline, fueling doubt about the authenticity of his claim. Only after he swore you to the code of silence surely? https://t.co/rVk43Rrw4F — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 21, 2025 Bill Morgan Responds with Sarcasm Legal expert Bill Morgan, widely respected in the XRP community for his grounded analysis of the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit, swiftly weighed in on the post. In a sardonic response, Morgan wrote, “Only after he swore you to the code of silence, surely?”—a pointed jab at the cryptic nature of Bale’s message. Morgan’s reply wasn’t merely humorous; it highlighted a recurring issue in crypto circles—unsubstantiated claims from influencers that lack transparency or factual grounding. As someone who has consistently advocated for legal accuracy over hype, Morgan’s tone reflected the increasing frustration among informed XRP supporters. Community Reactions: Support for Morgan, Scrutiny for Bale The XRP community, often dubbed the “XRP Army” reacted swiftly, with many praising Morgan’s stance. One user, xrp-dan, noted: “He’s posted this a few times.” Morgan, in agreement, replied: “Few too many times,” signaling a broader concern over repetitive, baseless claims. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another user, Mars0634, applauded Morgan for calling out misinformation, saying: “Brilliant Bill pulling up the many lies posted on X about XRP by these so-called influencers. Love it, keep it up.” Meanwhile, Guy Schiefelbein offered a more neutral perspective: “Arr you got to give it to Bale for being consistent.” The overall sentiment leaned toward skepticism, with many users reinforcing the need for credible updates rather than recycled promises. No Evidence of BlackRock Involvement with XRP Despite Bale’s assertion, there is no public record or official statement linking BlackRock to any direct interest in XRP. While BlackRock has explored tokenization, launched a Bitcoin ETF, and shown broader interest in digital assets, it has not announced any XRP-specific initiatives. In the absence of concrete evidence, such speculative posts serve only to inflate expectations and mislead new investors. Ripple vs. SEC: The Real Dates to Watch As XRP’s price and adoption outlook remain closely tied to regulatory outcomes, the most significant dates for the community right now lie within the courtroom. A decision on the final remedies, potentially including fines and injunctive relief, is expected soon. This outcome may directly affect Ripple’s business operations and the standing of XRP in the U.S. market. Until then, legal clarity, not influencer speculation, remains the most reliable signal for XRP’s institutional trajectory.

XRP Whales With Over 300% Gains Are Calm For Now In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the trend in the Realized Profit for a specific part of the Bitcoin network. The “ Realized Profit ” refers to a metric that measures, as its name already implies, the total amount of profit that the BTC investors as a whole are realizing through their selling. The indicator works by going through the transaction history of each token being sold on the blockchain to see what price it was moved at prior to this. If this previous selling price for any coin is less than the spot price that it’s now being sold at, then that particular token’s sale is leading to a realization of some net profit equal to the difference between the two values. The Realized Profit takes this difference for all profit-taking transactions and calculates their total sum to determine the situation for the network as a whole. Another indicator known as the Realized Loss tracks the sales of the opposite type. In the context of the current topic, the Realized Loss for the entire market isn’t of interest, but rather that of only a very specific portion of it: the XRP investors carrying gains of more than 300%. The only holders who would be in a profit of this level are those that bought the cryptocurrency prior to the asset’s explosion in November 2024. Thus, the Realized Profit of the cohort tells us about the level of profit-taking that these early buyers are participating in. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the indicator over the last couple of years: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP Realized Profit associated with investors carrying a profit margin of more than 300% saw a very sharp spike just after the initial price rally. This suggests that many of these early buyers didn’t wait too much to harvest their gains. Profit-taking from the group continued in early parts of 2025, although the spikes that the indicator witnessed were of a significantly smaller scale. After March, though, selling from these investors finally calmed down. From the chart, it’s apparent that this calm continued until this month, but the cohort ended up breaking its silence. “In early June, they began realizing profits at a pace of $68.8M per day (7D-SMA), signaling a wave of distribution by early holders,” notes Glassnode. So far since this selling spree, things have calmed down for the XRP Realized Profit of the cohort once more, but considering that these holders have taken part in selling on a few occasions already, it’s uncertain whether this means selling pressure has become exhausted or not. XRP Price XRP has faced a drop of more than 2% in the last 24 hours that has brought its price back to the $2.1 level.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-profit-taking-300-green-whales-paused-how-long/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","XRP|XRP Profit Taking|XRP Profits|XRP Whales|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare

2025-06-21T11:30:00,"Best New Altcoin to Buy Now as Bitcoin (BTC) Eyes Recovery to $110k","As Bitcoin (BTC) stabilizes near $105,474, with analysts projecting a potential run toward $110,000 fueled by ETF inflows and macro tailwinds, investor attention is shifting to the altcoin market, particularly toward emerging low-cap tokens with high upside. One such project now gaining major traction is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is being aggressively picked up by early adopters as a candidate for the best crypto to buy in 2025. Early buyers will get a preset profit of 100% ROI with the token going live at $0.06. In a summer where market watchers are constantly asking what crypto to invest in now or which altcoins could 10x by next year, Mutuum Finance is emerging as a clear standout, especially for those looking to diversify beyond Bitcoin’s large-cap orbit. Bitcoin Market Update: Institutional Backing Fuels $110K Recovery Bitcoin is currently trading at $105,474, having dipped from intraday highs near $107,199 before finding support above $103,597. Over the past week, robust inflows into spot BTC‑ETFs, exceeding $1 billion, have helped anchor price action above the $100K level amid geopolitical uncertainty and macroeconomic headwinds. Technical indicators show continued bullish momentum, with resistance looming between $110K–$112K; a breakout past this zone could open the door to $115K or higher, although a pullback toward $100K–$102.5K remains a possible short-term scenario. For now, Bitcoin is consolidating near the psychologically and technically significant $105K–$107K range. Amid these developments, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly gaining attention. Presale Hype Surges, Mutuum Finance Hits $10.9M Raised Mutuum Finance is exploding in popularity. With its innovative two-way lending model, this DeFi powerhouse has already attracted over 12,300 investors and raised $10.9 million, and it’s not slowing down. The MUTM token price is set to jump to $0.035 in Phase 6, marking a 16.67% surge, meaning those who get in now are positioned for major gains. Early adopters are locking in profits. Mutuum Finance Lending: Smarter, Simpler, Decentralized Mutuum Finance combines both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, giving users reliable returns from USDT pools via the P2C model and full control of direct crypto transactions via the P2P model. Mutuum Finance’s USD-Pegged Stablecoin Mutuum Finance’s upcoming overcollateralized USD-pegged stablecoin, launching on Ethereum, is designed to maintain price stability and avoid the pitfalls that have been seen with algorithmic stablecoins. With the project already audited by CertiK, Mutuum Finance is laying the groundwork for massive adoption, and those paying attention now could reap the biggest rewards later. In addition, the platform is running a massive $100,000 giveaway , where 10 lucky winners will receive $10,000 each in Mutuum Finance tokens. As Bitcoin eyes a return to $110,000, savvy investors are looking beyond the majors for outsized gains, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is leading that charge. With over $10.9 million raised and a growing base of 12,300+ investors, the project’s presale is accelerating fast. Priced at $0.03 in Phase 5 and set to launch at $0.06, buyers today are positioned for 100% returns before the token even hits the open market. Add in a Certik audit, a dual-model lending platform, a USD-pegged stablecoin, and a $100,000 giveaway, and it’s clear why Mutuum is being called the best new altcoin to buy now. Don’t miss your chance, secure your tokens before the next price jump.

2025-06-21T11:20:49,"Trump’s Shocking $1 Trillion Savings Claim: What It Means for Interest Rates and the Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld Trump’s Shocking $1 Trillion Savings Claim: What It Means for Interest Rates and the Crypto Market Former U.S. President Donald Trump recently made a significant claim regarding the nation’s finances, suggesting that a specific action by the Federal Reserve could lead to massive annual savings. For those tracking the pulse of the Crypto Market , understanding such macroeconomic discussions is crucial, as they often provide insights into the potential flow of capital and investor sentiment. Let’s break down Trump’s statement and explore its possible implications for the broader US Economy and digital assets. What Did Trump Say About Interest Rates ? In a post on Truth Social, Donald Trump asserted that if Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell were to lower benchmark Interest Rates to a range of 1% to 2%, the United States government could realize annual savings of up to $1 trillion. This bold claim ties the direct cost of government borrowing to the Fed’s monetary policy decisions. Trump also used the statement as an opportunity to criticize the current administration, attributing what he sees as high costs to the policies enacted under President Biden. His remarks position the lowering of Interest Rates not just as an economic adjustment but as a significant fiscal maneuver with substantial savings potential. How Do the Federal Reserve’s Actions Influence the US Economy ? The Federal Reserve , often referred to as the ‘Fed’, is the central banking system of the United States. Its primary tool for influencing the US Economy is setting the target range for the federal funds rate – the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight borrowing. This rate serves as a benchmark that influences other interest rates throughout the economy, including: Rates on mortgages and car loans Interest earned on savings accounts and bonds Borrowing costs for businesses The cost of government debt When the Fed lowers Interest Rates , it typically aims to stimulate economic activity by making borrowing cheaper, encouraging spending and investment. Conversely, raising rates is intended to cool down an overheating economy and combat inflation by making borrowing more expensive. Trump’s argument centers on the government’s own borrowing costs. The U.S. government issues Treasury bonds and other debt instruments to finance its operations and existing debt. The interest paid on this debt is a significant government expense. Lowering market Interest Rates generally leads to lower yields on newly issued government debt, potentially reducing the government’s annual interest payments, which is the basis for Trump’s $1 trillion savings claim. Could Lower Interest Rates Really Save $1 Trillion? The potential savings figure cited by Trump is substantial and depends on several factors, including the total amount of outstanding government debt, the average maturity of that debt, and the speed at which lower rates would translate into lower borrowing costs for new or refinanced debt. Here’s a simplified look at the concept: The U.S. national debt is currently in the tens of trillions of dollars. A portion of this debt matures regularly and must be refinanced by issuing new debt. If the prevailing Interest Rates are lower when new debt is issued, the interest payments on that new debt will be lower. Over time, as more high-interest debt matures and is replaced by lower-interest debt, the total annual interest expense could decrease significantly. However, reaching a $1 trillion annual saving depends on a rapid and sustained drop in borrowing costs across a vast amount of debt. Economists have varying estimates on the potential savings from lower rates, and $1 trillion is generally considered to be at the higher end of projections, potentially requiring a more significant and prolonged rate reduction than the 1-2% target range mentioned by Trump, or assuming a very rapid turnover of existing debt. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve’s decisions are based on its dual mandate: achieving maximum employment and stable prices (controlling inflation). While the impact on government borrowing costs is a consideration, it is not the primary driver of monetary policy. The Fed must weigh the potential benefits of lower rates (like reduced government interest expense and economic stimulation) against the risks, particularly the risk of fueling inflation, which could ultimately harm the US Economy . What is the Potential Crypto Market Impact? Discussions around Interest Rates and the US Economy are closely watched by participants in the Crypto Market . Here’s why: Risk-On Sentiment: Lower interest rates typically make traditional, safer investments like bonds less attractive due to lower yields. This can encourage investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets, including stocks and cryptocurrencies. This is often referred to as a ‘risk-on’ environment. Liquidity: When the Fed lowers rates or engages in quantitative easing (another monetary tool), it generally increases the overall liquidity in the financial system. More money flowing through the economy can find its way into various asset classes, including crypto. Inflation Hedges: While the Fed’s goal with higher rates has been to combat inflation, some investors view assets like Bitcoin as a potential hedge against currency devaluation, especially if expansive monetary policies (like very low rates) are pursued over long periods. Comparison to Traditional Finance: As interest rates rise, the cost of capital increases for businesses, potentially slowing growth. For speculative assets like many cryptocurrencies, a lower-rate environment can make their potential future value more appealing compared to the lower returns offered elsewhere. If the Federal Reserve were to significantly lower Interest Rates towards the 1-2% range suggested by Trump , many analysts would anticipate this being a bullish signal for the Crypto Market , assuming other economic factors remain stable. Cheaper borrowing could also potentially free up capital for institutional or individual investors to allocate to digital assets. Navigating Economic Statements: Actionable Insights For those involved in the Crypto Market , keeping an eye on macroeconomic indicators and political commentary is important, but it’s crucial to approach them with a critical perspective. Distinguish Policy from Proposal: Trump’s statement is a proposal and a critique, not current Fed policy. The Fed operates independently and makes decisions based on complex economic data, not political directives. Understand the ‘Why’: Consider the context and potential motivations behind political statements on the economy. Focus on Fed Communication: Pay closer attention to official statements and minutes from the Federal Reserve ‘s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings for actual policy direction. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: While a significant shift in Interest Rates could have long-term implications for the Crypto Market , short-term market movements are influenced by a vast array of factors, including regulation, technological developments, and market sentiment specific to crypto. Do Your Own Research: Economic forecasts and the impact of policy are complex and subject to change. Rely on diverse sources of information and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions based on macroeconomic predictions. While the prospect of $1 trillion in savings is a headline-grabbing figure, the path to achieving it through significantly lower Interest Rates involves intricate economic trade-offs that the Federal Reserve must navigate carefully to ensure the long-term health of the US Economy . The reaction of the Crypto Market to any such policy shift would be just one piece of the larger economic puzzle. Summary Donald Trump has put forward the idea that lowering Federal Reserve Interest Rates to 1-2% could save the US Economy $1 trillion annually, while also criticizing current policy. While lower rates can indeed reduce government borrowing costs and historically tend to favor risk-on assets like those in the Crypto Market , the Fed’s decisions are driven by broader economic mandates like employment and inflation control. The potential savings figure is significant but depends on many variables. For crypto enthusiasts, this serves as a reminder that macroeconomic policy is a key factor to monitor, but official Fed actions and a comprehensive understanding of economic dynamics are more reliable indicators than political statements alone.

2025-06-21T11:19:59,"Wall Street Is Missing Coinbase's Leverage To The Next Supercycle (Rating Upgrade)","Summary Coinbase's stablecoin revenue has grown considerably in recent years. With institutional adoption on the horizon, the stock has considerable exposure to a new kind of institutional investment cycle, one focused on crypto's payment rails. Trading at only 18x Adjusted EBITDA, (as a run-rate) we think the stock appears quite reasonably priced. We're upgrading COIN to a 'Strong Buy'. Over the last few years, we've put out a number of articles on Coinbase ( COIN ), consistently calling the stock a ' Buy ': Seeking Alpha This is due to the fact that we see the crypto space growing in importance over the next decade, as the ecosystem's overall size, functionality, and accessibility begin to rival the traditional financial system. In the past, part of our bullish thesis has centered around Coinbase’s exposure to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Bitcoin trading volumes, which have historically made up a large portion of the firm's revenues. It shouldn’t be a surprise, then, that the stock has correlated strongly with Bitcoin's price since IPO: TradingView However, as stablecoin legislation makes its way through US Congress, and we see increased interest from 'traditional' companies in the space, we think the next crypto cycle is already taking shape. In the past, we’ve seen speculative frenzies dominated by meme coins, NFTs, and a fixation on both Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), perhaps to the exclusion of all else. Now, as decentralized finance apps and stablecoins begin to offer the world new payment rails for stable value exchange, we think COIN's services revenue will begin generating a majority of appreciation for shareholders going forward. Over the last few years, Coinbase has done an excellent job at cutting costs and diversifying its revenue base. Now, with the potential for massively increased institutional adoption, we think COIN's non-transaction revenues will power the stock's next leg higher. It’s true that COIN is expensive on some metrics, but when you break it down, we actually think the market is asking a reasonable price from investors. Today , we'll dive into the company's recent results, explain why we think COIN's diversified revenue should bolster margins and growth, and reiterate the case that we think Coinbase is 'one to own' for the years ahead. Sound good? Let’s dive in. Financials Our last coverage of Coinbase was in October of last year, and so before we dive into the recent updates that have reinforced our bullish view, it’s probably worth covering some of the recent numbers, just to get a sense of where the stock currently sits. In Q4 of 2024, Coinbase reported revenues of $2.27 billion, which represented 138% year-over-year growth. Similarly, the company reported earnings per share of ~$4.68, which came in well above analyst estimates. By all counts, this was a strong corner. In Q1 of 2025, results were a bit weaker, with revenue actually down sequentially, although still up 24% YoY. EPS also missed by quite a large margin: Seeking Alpha However, when you zoom out, much of this EPS volatility has to do with the company's 'Fair Value' mark of its crypto holdings. If you look at Coinbase from a cash perspective, the firm appears to be in a much stronger operating position. Once you strip out depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and gains and losses from the crypto portfolio, adjusted EBITDA for Q1 of this year was down only very slightly YoY, from $1.02 billion to $930 million: 10Q This reflects gaining momentum in the company's EBITDA, which has now — for several quarters — earned at roughly a $1 billion run rate. Annualize this, and Coinbase as a firm — subject to some volatility and trading revenues — is producing roughly $4 billion a year in adjusted EBITDA. Not bad! With some stocks, using adjusted EBITDA can be a tricky measure, but given that the majority of Coinbase's adjustments are correcting for crypto portfolio fluctuations, we think it’s actually a relatively fair representation of what’s going on, 'on the ground'. Frankly, when we first started covering the stock back in May 2023, Coinbase was just turning the corner on revenue diversification and cost-cutting. Now, two years on, the firm is pumping out solid, consistent adjusted EBITDA off the back of a diversified revenue base at the center of the regulated crypto ecosystem. We expect the company to continue making gains as institutional adoption increases. Recently, we’ve seen a number of headlines that bolster our view that increased institutional adoption is on the way. This week, the US Senate recently voted for and passed a bill giving much stronger legal footing to the stablecoin market. This is a big deal, especially considering the bill's bipartisan support. Now, with the stroke of a pen, Donald Trump could turn whatever final bill lands on his desk into a cohesive outline for how modern businesses can actually use crypto payment rails and free themselves from oppressive credit card fees. Additionally, as this legislation has advanced, we’ve seen comments from major retailers like Walmart ( WMT ) and Amazon ( AMZN ) that they’re looking into using crypto payment rails and stablecoins to reduce payment friction and increase profitability. CFOs at other companies may begin seeing the potential benefits of using stablecoins, and we expect Coinbase to garner a majority of this business. Revenue-wise, Coinbase is well-prepared to monetize this opportunity. The company is known for its retail and institutional trading platforms and brokerage capability, but COIN's revenue streams have now diversified to the point that in Q1 of this year, 35% of revenue came from stablecoins, blockchain rewards, interest, and subscription revenues from programs like 'Coinbase One': Seeking Alpha As we see it, COIN has numerous levers to grow from both traditional routes and increased institutional crypto adoption, and the stock should move beyond how many currently on Wall Street see it — as an underperforming Bitcoin wrapper. Valuation So, COIN's financials have improved, and we think the firm has considerable upside in the event of increased crypto adoption through its service offerings. Why does the stock look so expensive? In short, by some metrics, COIN is trading at a heightened multiple. You can see this in the stock's price-to-sales ratio, which stands at around 11x: TradingView There’s no doubt that this is high, both relative to the past , and nominally vs. the market . However, if you look at the company, Coinbase sports considerable operating margins—at least once you strip out the net income fluctuations from the crypto portfolio. In Q1, the firm produced $2 billion in revenue and $930 million in adjusted EBITDA. This is a nearly 50% cash margin. Not only that, but COIN is now producing roughly $4 billion in adjusted EBITDA, with a market cap of $75.2 billion. Broken down like this, the stock is actually trading at an 18x multiple. This appears MUCH more reasonable. We would argue that for a company that has so much potential upside, to such a large potential shift in the way this financial system works, paying 18x adjusted EBITDA appears like an incredibly fair price. Again, if you look at Seeking Alpha's valuation grade of Coinbase, you’ll find the stock's multiples look quite high versus the financial sector: Seeking Alpha In fact, the stock earns an 'F' rating. That said, many of these numbers are skewed dramatically by the 'Fair Value' fluctuations. Additionally, the company's lumpy results and uncertain growth catalyst timings make the stock look expensive. If Coinbase manages to continue growing EBITDA into the future, we think a purchase today at under $300 per share could be incredibly advantageous for investors. When you add up COIN's significant leverage to the next potential crypto cycle along with the diversity of revenue sources, high margins, and relatively attractive price point, we think the stock looks like a 'Strong Buy'. Risks Of course, when it comes to Coinbase, there are some risks to consider. First and foremost, many of COIN's revenues come from transaction fees from retail users. These still make up the lion's share of revenue. This means that a protracted lack of interest in the crypto ecosystem would also likely have a negative impact on Coinbase's revenue picture. This is what we saw in 2021. However, management has — as we mentioned — taken steps to reduce reliance on trading revenues, which, we think, makes the stock appear more well-prepared for an inevitable future slowdown. Additionally, many of the assets that trade on Coinbase’s platform remain without a regulatory framework. This presents a considerable regulatory risk for Coinbase. The stablecoin news is welcome but make no mistake — regulatory risk remains as Coinbase continues to offer altcoins that have (frankly) questionable status as securities. Management has done an excellent job navigating the regulatory storm in the past, but we think that’s possible that risks here could flare back up. This would likely ding the stock, at least in the short term. Summary Overall, though, we think COIN is incredibly well-prepared to capitalize on the next crypto cycle in a way that it hasn’t been able to before. With increased exposure to stablecoin revenues, reduced regulatory risk, and continued EBITDA margin strength, we think Coinbase's organic performance has a great trajectory. Coupled with a multiple that we think appears very reasonable, it’s hard to see the stock as anything other than a ' Strong Buy '. Thus, our rating.

The claims came after co-founder Jaz Gulati posted a snapshot of Garden’s Dune Analytics dashboard on X, boasting that it had collected $300,000 in fees over 12 days. ZachXBT responded to the post, bashing Garden of supporting Chinese-based laundering operations that helped move funds stolen in the Bybit hack by the Lazarus Group. “ You conveniently left out >80% of your fees came from Chinese launderers moving Lazarus Group funds from the Bybit hack ,” he reckoned. “ Who are you building for again? ” Crypto security analyst questions dashboard data According to the Dune dashboard, as of June 19, Garden Finance had processed 24,984 BTC in total volume, equal to approximately $1.5 billion in USD value, through over 40,000 atomic swaps. The platform’s largest swap to date was 10 BTC, while total reported fees collected stood at 40.11 BTC. Responding to ZachXBT’s claims, Gulati argued that “30 BTC fees came before the hack even happened,” attaching a Discord screenshot dated October 24, 2024, showing roughly 30 BTC in fees. this is great analysis since 30 BTC fees came before the hack even happened pic.twitter.com/C6A5F3BLsd — Jaz 🌸 (@jzgulati) June 21, 2025 The on-chain sleuth noted that he hadn’t even mentioned funds from “other DPRK hacks yet, like WazirX,” bashing the DeFi protocol for failing to flag the hackers’ transactions. Bybit’s hack, which occurred on February 21, 2025, involved a breach of the exchange’s cold wallet. Nearly $1.5 billion in Ethereum was siphoned from user accounts after attackers compromised a developer working on SAFE Wallet, a platform used by Bybit customers, five days ahead of the exploit. Several analysts, including ZachXBT, traced the stolen funds to laundering networks operating through DeFi bridges to the Lazarus Group . Gulati lambasted the blockchain security analyst by saying he was speaking from a point of “misinformation.” ZachXBT then asked : “ Explain how it is ‘decentralized’ when I watched in real time for multiple days as a single entity kept topping up liquidity from Coinbase for the Chinese launderers as they continued moving Bybit funds? ” explain how it is “decentralized” when I watched in real time for multiple days as a single entity kept topping up cbBTC liquidity from Coinbase for the Chinese launderers as they continued moving Bybit funds? — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) June 21, 2025 The developer is yet to respond to the question. Who helped Lazarus in the $230 million WazirX hack? In his accusations against Gulati, ZachXBT talked about the attack on WazirX , an Indian crypto exchange, where the Lazarus Group reportedly stole more than $230 million in crypto. That hack, which took place on July 18, 2024, was executed through forged smart contract signatures used to bypass WazirX’s multisig wallet protections. Hackers drained funds within an hour of gaining access. Similar to the Bybit case, investigators traced the exploit to North Korea’s Lazarus Group. Authorities in Japan, the United States, and South Korea later issued a joint cybersecurity alert identifying similar tactics used across both attacks. The group reportedly used social engineering, phishing, TraderTraitor and AppleJeus malware to target developer workstations and compromise their infrastructure. Crypto stolen in both hacks was subsequently laundered across decentralized platforms, often using mixers to obscure transaction trails. Garden Finance’s dashboard shows there was a spike in Bitcoin swaps between May and June 2025, with individual daily volumes peaking near 90 transactions in wrapped Bitcoin assets. The chart lists swaps by chain-token combinations such as base-cbBTC, ethereum-WBTC, and arbitrum-WBTC, with base-cbBTC recording the highest usage statistics. cbBTC, a wrapped Bitcoin asset pegged to Coinbase BTC, was mentioned by ZachXBT in his attack on Garden Finance, propounding that the platform was party to the untraceable movements of illicit funds from DPRK hackers .

2025-06-21T10:48:28,"Raoul Pal says the current crypto cycle is like 2017","Crypto research platform Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal has said the current crypto cycle is very similar to the one that was witnessed in 2017. According to Pal, Bitcoin posted a steady uptrend all through the year before skyrocketing towards the end of the year. The Real Vision CEO gave his verdict via a video, where he said, “It’s spookily similar to 2017.” Pal also said he is beginning to see a longer crypto cycle, forecasting that it might take a while this time around given the business cycle score. The business cycle score, according to Pal, is a macroeconomic model he uses to track the position of the global economy in the broader cycle. He added that it is still below 50 and it generally “takes a while to climb up.” Raoul Pal sees similarities in the current and 2017 crypto market cycle According to CoinMarketCap data, Bitcoin started trading around $1,044 at the beginning of 2017, before rising to around $2,187 by May 31. The premier digital asset went on to close the year at $14,156, signifying a massive rise of 1,255% from the price at the beginning of the year. While Pal predicts the same movement, he acknowledges that a weaker US dollar could indicate a slower crypto cycle, which means it will take time before it reaches its peak. “With the dollar breaking down even today, it’s starting to suggest this may go into Q2 2026,” he said. Since the beginning of the year, the US Dollar Index has been down 8.995, sitting at 98.77 at the time of writing, according to data from TradingView. Bitcoin and DXY are inversely correlated. This means that when the dollar weakens, Bitcoin becomes more attractive not just as a speculative investment but as an alternative currency. Pal also added that macroeconomic data has been a primary reason why the crypto cycle has always shifted further back. “It’s like the whole cycle got shifted cause rates didn’t get adjusted; the dollar was sideways for some time,” he said. He also said that the current market may show signs of looking like the market in 2020 more than the one in 2021, suggesting that it could be at an earlier growth phase than many are predicting. Bitcoin began 2020 at $7,174, but dropped by 27% in March to $5,227. The asset then rebounded 129% to hit $11,990 in August, before witnessing a 304% increase, ending the year at $28,993. Pal added that the market needs to continue expanding to attract big players. He discussed his recent trip to the Middle East where he met with Sovereign Wealth Funds, adding that most of them were bullish on crypto. “The mandate across the entire region, from Saudi to Abu Dhabi to Dubai to Bahrain to Qatar, is AI and blockchain,” he said. He also added that things should evolve past just seeing Bitcoin as a reserve asset, noting that nations need to start building their entire government infrastructure on blockchain. Global governments have been making moves in the crypto sector since the beginning of the year. A typical example is Pakistan, with the country looking for ways to create a draft bill that could be passed in the near future to regulate digital assets. In addition, the country plans to formulate regulations that will protect its investors and attract global players into its digital asset hub.

2025-06-21T10:30:29,"Spot Crypto ETF Approval: Analyst Predicts Massive 90%+ Chance","BitcoinWorld Spot Crypto ETF Approval: Analyst Predicts Massive 90%+ Chance Exciting news is circulating in the cryptocurrency world, suggesting that a significant breakthrough for mainstream adoption might be just around the corner. A prominent voice in financial analysis has weighed in on the likelihood of a spot crypto ETF finally making its way to market, and their outlook is overwhelmingly positive. This development could pave the way for easier access to digital assets for both institutional and retail investors. What Are the Current ETF Approval Odds ? According to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart , the chances of seeing most spot crypto ETF applications receive the green light are remarkably high. Seyffart recently took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to share his analysis, asserting a confidence level exceeding 90% for the approval of these products. This figure represents a significant shift in sentiment compared to past years when such approvals seemed like a distant possibility. The analyst’s assessment provides a strong indicator of the growing maturity of the crypto market and the increasing inevitability of regulated investment products. Why Is Increased Communication with the SEC Approval a Positive Sign? A key factor contributing to Seyffart’s optimistic forecast is the noticeable increase in communication between asset managers applying for the ETFs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Historically, the SEC has been cautious, citing concerns around market manipulation, investor protection, and the nascent nature of the crypto markets. However, the recent engagement suggests a more constructive dialogue is taking place. This enhanced communication indicates that the SEC may be actively working through the concerns and technical details necessary for approving these complex financial products. It signals progress towards finding common ground and establishing the necessary regulatory frameworks. Navigating the Path to Crypto ETF Approval The journey towards crypto ETF approval in the United States has been a long and often frustrating one. While futures-based Bitcoin ETFs have been approved and are trading, a spot ETF, which holds the underlying asset directly, has remained elusive. Many believe a spot ETF offers a more direct and potentially less complex investment vehicle for investors. The SEC’s previous rejections have often centered on surveillance-sharing agreements and concerns about the unregulated nature of underlying crypto exchanges. The increased communication noted by James Seyffart likely involves addressing these specific regulatory hurdles and establishing robust investor safeguards. Insights from James Seyffart on Timing While the probability of approval is high, the exact timing remains uncertain, according to James Seyffart . He stated, “Could be something we’re talking about in the next month or two. Or it could be something that waits until October or later. Matter of when not if.” This perspective suggests that while the regulatory wheels are turning, the process still involves significant steps and potential delays. Investors and market participants should prepare for potential outcomes ranging from near-term approvals to those happening later in the year. The focus, as Seyffart highlights, should be on the strong likelihood of approval rather than fixating on a precise date. Understanding the Potential Impact of a Spot Crypto ETF The approval of a spot crypto ETF is widely seen as a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency market. Here are some potential impacts: Increased Institutional Investment: ETFs provide a familiar, regulated, and easily accessible structure for large financial institutions, pension funds, and wealth managers to gain exposure to crypto without directly holding the assets. Enhanced Retail Access: Investing in crypto through a traditional brokerage account via an ETF is simpler for many retail investors than setting up crypto exchange accounts and managing private keys. Market Legitimacy: Regulatory approval from the SEC lends significant credibility to the crypto asset class, potentially attracting more conservative investors. Potential Price Impact: Increased demand from new investor classes could positively impact the price of the underlying cryptocurrencies. Improved Liquidity: A successful ETF can add significant trading volume and liquidity to the market. However, potential challenges exist, including market volatility, concentration risk in specific assets, and the influence of large fund flows on price dynamics. Conclusion: High Probability, Uncertain Timeline The analysis shared by Bloomberg’s James Seyffart offers a compelling outlook for the future of cryptocurrency investments. The assertion of a 90%+ chance for widespread crypto ETF approval , driven by improved dialogue with the SEC, paints a picture of regulatory acceptance becoming a reality. While the specific timeline for these approvals remains fluid, the message is clear: it appears to be a question of ‘when,’ not ‘if.’ This development holds the potential to unlock significant new capital and mainstream participation in the crypto market, marking a pivotal moment for the industry.

2025-06-21T10:23:59,"Crypto Dip As Trump Says Iran’s Leader An ‘Easy Target’ But This DeFi Token Is Defying Odds","The post Crypto Dip As Trump Says Iran’s Leader An ‘Easy Target’ But This DeFi Token Is Defying Odds appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is reeling after President Donald Trump’s provocative claim that Iran’s leader is an “easy target,” sparking a sharp decline in major coins. Bitcoin dropped from $104,310 to $103,553 within an hour, while Ether and XRP fell 1.3% each. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index slid to “Neutral,” reflecting shaken investor confidence. Geopolitical tensions, intensified by recent Israel-Iran clashes, fuel this uncertainty. Yet, amidst this turmoil, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is defying odds, drawing attention as a promising defi crypto. Its presale, now in phase 5, has raised $10,900,000, with over 560 million tokens sold to 12,300 holders. Investors are flocking to this rising star. Bitcoin’s Stumble Amid Tensions Trump’s bold statement on Truth Social, hinting at Iran’s supreme leader’s vulnerability, sent shockwaves through crypto prices. Bitcoin, hovering above $105,000, briefly dipped below $104,000 before recovering slightly. Analysts warn it may test the $100,000 mark soon, with some predicting a drop to $93,000. The crypto fear and greed index, now at 52, signals caution among traders. This isn’t Trump’s first market jolt; his tariff policies earlier in 2025 also rattled investors. Consequently, many are questioning if crypto investment remains viable. Despite this, one project stands resilient, offering hope in a turbulent market.

2025-06-21T10:23:58,"Crypto Bull Run Alert: Altcoins Set for 10x to 20x Gains in Q3","The post Crypto Bull Run Alert: Altcoins Set for 10x to 20x Gains in Q3 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The entire crypto market is tumbling under rising geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty, pulling its valuation down to $3.2 trillion with a modest 1.10% dip in the past day. A sudden 42% spike in trading volume hints at panic moves, while the Fear & Greed Index sits at 43, marking a neutral but uneasy mood. Bitcoin is trading at $103,491, down 0.94% with a daily low of $102,372. Moreover, a 38% spike in volume to $50.25B signals heavy trading, but not clear bullish momentum. Despite the bearish clouds, a popular analyst, Nathan from Investing Made Simple, says the Bitcoin bull market is far from done, and the best is yet to come. In his latest video , he laid out three distinct models that all point to one target: a parabolic move to $200,000 or more by the end of 2025. Three Data-Backed Models Point $200K Target The analyst first broke down Bitcoin’s historical cycle returns, noting that after every bear market low, BTC typically experiences exponential growth . From the 2022 bottom of $15,500, a 10–15x return places the top somewhere between $140,000 and $210,000, in line with previous cycles, though slightly more conservative due to market maturity. The second method used Bitcoin’s last all-time high of $69,000 as a baseline, applying the common bull market pattern of 2–3x gains from that peak. Again, this results in a target range of $140,000 to $210,000. Finally, he introduced the Power Law Model, which tracks Bitcoin’s price trajectory against time using logarithmic growth. This model not only suggests a peak around $210,000 but also forecasts the final blow-off phase to occur between October and December 2025, similar to what we’ve seen in past cycles. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Demand Momentum Shows Bears Are Giving Up – Price Reversal Ahead? , Altcoins Could See Explosive Gains in Q3 While Bitcoin price may grab the headlines, the analyst emphasized that altcoins could be the real winners in the final leg of the bull market. Historically, the last quarter of a cycle, when Bitcoin enters its parabolic phase, is when altcoins truly explode, often outperforming BTC by several multiples. The analyst also hinted that top-tier altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche could deliver massive returns, especially if money flows from Bitcoin into more speculative assets, as it typically does near cycle tops. Even mid- and low-cap coins could rally 10x to 20x, but the analyst warns this phase is usually short-lived, sometimes lasting just a few weeks. He added that timing will be key, and investors sitting on the sidelines too long may miss out on the most profitable window of the entire cycle. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-21T10:04:21,"Bitcoin Solaris: The $8 Token Set to Explode Like Early Bitcoin – Crypto Presale Already Raised $5 Million","The post Bitcoin Solaris: The $8 Token Set to Explode Like Early Bitcoin – Crypto Presale Already Raised $5 Million appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin’s first wave of gains went to early participants — the ones mining and moving BTC before it hit headlines. Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche followed similar patterns. The biggest returns always came before exposure, while networks were still small and tokens were still affordable. Bitcoin Solaris is in that phase right now. The presale is live at $8 per token. More than $5 million has already been raised by over 11,500 wallets. The projected listing price is $20 — locking in a 150% gain before a single exchange opens. But the difference here isn’t just timing. It’s function. BTC-S already powers products that reward users daily, with token velocity, live mining, and an expanding reward economy. Daily Rewards, Real Token Flow At the center of the Bitcoin Solaris economy is Nova — the mobile mining app that lets users earn BTC-S directly from their phones. It’s not a wrapped service or outsourced cloud pool. The system measures real usage and distributes token rewards based on device contribution, with no capital lockup or staking period required. Early beta testers out-earned some of the largest staking platforms, all without buying rigs or running wallets 24/7. The app is in active rollout, with more users onboarded as presale expands. BTC-S also moves through the Bitcoin Solaris Casino — an on-chain reward engine that distributes tokens daily. All verified users get one free spin per day, with instant payout chances. Buyers who hit specific spending tiers unlock larger reward pools, including up to 0.5 BTC in bonuses. The spin logic is automated and smart contract-driven — no centralized draw, no delayed credits. These systems keep BTC-S circulating before it even hits public markets. That flow drives demand, creates winners daily, and reinforces the core value loop that’s already running. Presale at $8, Capped Supply, and No Inflation Only 4.2 million BTC-S tokens are available in the presale. The total supply is capped at 21 million — forever. There are no future emissions, no inflation schedules, and no hidden unlocks waiting to dilute value. What’s being sold now is the only public supply until listings. At $8, the token is still priced under 40% of its projected launch value. With active products already distributing BTC-S and more utilities on the way, the price is still trailing the value. Every user participating now is ahead of both the listing and the demand wave that comes with it. The opportunity isn’t just in scarcity — it’s in position. This is the phase where utility already works, but market access hasn’t priced it in yet. Audited, Verified, and Already Covered by Analysts BTC-S isn’t just delivering functionality — it’s doing it transparently. The core contracts have been audited by Cyberscope . The Nova App’s mining logic was independently reviewed by Freshcoins . And the dev team has completed KYC verification to back investor safety. In a recent breakdown, Token Empire called Bitcoin Solaris the only project under $10 where rewards are moving, products are active, and upside hasn’t been locked out. Product Momentum Is Pushing Value Forward BTC-S isn’t sitting in wallets. It’s circulating. Between Nova and the Casino, tokens are moving daily, creating reward loops that continue to grow as new users join in. The next expansion is the Mining Power Marketplace — a live-use platform that lets users monetize unused processing power or rent capacity using BTC-S. The feature is already in development and ties directly into the network’s value cycle. Wallet upgrades, testnet deployment, and developer tools are all scheduled for release this year. These aren’t stretch targets. They’re tracked, funded, and moving forward with presale capital that’s already raised. Bitcoin Solaris isn’t a theory or a bet on potential. It’s a network already distributing tokens, already rewarding users, and still sitting at just $8 per token. The $20 listing target gives new buyers immediate upside. But the real value is in getting in before BTC-S becomes harder to earn — and more expensive to buy.

2025-06-21T10:02:51,"XRP News: Ripple Lawyer Bill Morgan Slams U.S. Escrow Seizure Rumors","The post XRP News: Ripple Lawyer Bill Morgan Slams U.S. Escrow Seizure Rumors appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Fresh speculation about the U.S. government’s interest in Ripple’s XRP escrow is stirring debate across the crypto space, but Ripple-affiliated lawyer Bill Morgan has stepped in to squash the noise over Ripple’s XRP escrow for the national reserve. As rumors spread about the possible use of XRP in America’s national financial reserve, Morgan calls the idea unfounded and unlikely. No it won’t. https://t.co/48zQvTBUg9 — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) June 21, 2025 No, the Government Won’t Seize XRP Escrow Rumors started circulating after online influencers suggested that the U.S. could tap into Ripple’s XRP escrow as part of a broader crypto reserve strategy. Some went as far as claiming this would support the country’s financial system in the digital age. Bill Morgan, however, made it clear—“No, it won’t.” He dismissed the speculation outright, denying any government plan to take control of the XRP escrow held by Ripple. RUMOR: Whispers from D.C. suggest something massive — U.S. authorities are exploring whether Ripple’s $XRP escrow could be repurposed as part of America’s national financial reserves. Sound far-fetched? So did Bitcoin ETFs once. Strategic digital assets are heating up. XRP… pic.twitter.com/SQsyeo5gBz — Paul White Gold Eagle (@PaulGoldEagle) June 20, 2025 His comment comes amid growing buzz on X, where crypto analysts like John Squire and Pumpius have floated the theory that the U.S. might explore XRP’s utility for reserve backing. While some compare the possibility to the once-unlikely approval of Bitcoin ETFs , Morgan isn’t buying it. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP Prices are Down Today? , Fed Payment Rumors Add Fuel At the same time, new posts have emerged claiming that the U.S. Federal Reserve is already using XRP via its FedNow payment system. One viral post insisted that XRP use is “100% confirmed.” But this appears to stretch the facts. Volante Technologies, a partner in the FedNow pilot, has integrated Ripple tech for cross-border payments. Still, there’s no verified indication that XRP itself is being used by the Fed for transactions. Why Now? These rumors gained more attention following Ripple’s release of 1 billion XRP from escrow in early June. Split across three large transactions, the tokens were valued at over $2.2 billion. Combined with recent discussions around a potential U.S. strategic crypto reserve , including altcoins like XRP and SOL, the speculation has only intensified. Despite XRP’s growing presence in global payments infrastructure, there’s no concrete evidence to support claims of its seizure or inclusion in the U.S. reserve. For now, they remain speculative at best. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Ripple’s XRP escrow is a mechanism designed to manage the circulating supply of XRP. Ripple locked up 55 billion XRP in 2017, releasing 1 billion monthly, with most being re-locked to prevent market shocks and ensure stability. How does Ripple’s escrow mechanism work, and what legal or technical barriers exist to government intervention? The XRP Ledger’s built-in protocol governs the time-locked escrow, making it technically difficult for direct external seizure. Legally, any government intervention would face significant challenges given the decentralized nature of crypto and potential property rights issues. How does the ongoing Ripple-SEC case affect the regulatory landscape for XRP and similar digital assets? The Ripple-SEC case, which largely determined XRP is not a security for programmatic sales, has brought some regulatory clarity. Its resolution could set precedents for how other digital assets are classified and regulated in the U.S., influencing future enforcement and legislation.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-news-ripple-lawyer-bill-morgan-slams-u-s-escrow-seizure-rumors/,"ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|SOL|XRP","News|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

2025-06-21T10:00:00,"Analysts split on Bitcoin as altcoins AERO and KAIA outperform broader market","Bitcoin bulls held the line at a key support level this week, resulting in sideways price action as markets digested a flurry of macro developments. Despite Bitcoin’s stability, the broader crypto market slipped over 2% to $3.37 trillion by Friday. Most of the losses were concentrated in Bitcoin, while the altcoin sector defied the downtrend, climbing approximately 3.2% in total market value. Sentiment gradually weakened through the week, barring a brief midweek uptick. By Friday, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index had slipped to 48, hovering at the lower end of neutral territory as traders remained cautious of volatility. Why is Bitcoin stuck? Bitcoin remained confined within a narrow range between $103,645 and $108,771 this week, as mounting macroeconomic and geopolitical pressures kept traders on the sidelines. Early week tension between Iran and Israel dampened risk appetite, limiting price action despite occasional intraday rallies. By Friday, BTC had edged up 1.1% to $106,081, but this modest gain followed three days of stagnation between $104,000 and $105,000. The Juneteenth holiday pause in U.S. markets further contributed to the lack of momentum, with S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures dipping roughly 0.3% ahead of the reopening. A key overhang remains the escalation risk in the Middle East. Although President Trump’s two-week deadline before making a military decision against Iran has temporarily eased fears of immediate escalation, the geopolitical backdrop continues to inject uncertainty into markets. According to Exness strategist Christopher Tahir, traders may remain risk-averse until clarity emerges on both the geopolitical and monetary policy fronts. Adding to this is the Federal Reserve’s decision to hold interest rates steady, a move largely priced in by markets. However, the revised dot plot, with just four cuts in total over the next three years , down from six in previous forecasts, carried a hawkish undertone that could continue to dampen risk appetite in the near term. On-chain data is also showing signs of buyer exhaustion. According to CryptoQuant, short-term Bitcoin holders, those who entered the market in recent months, have reduced their holdings by roughly 800,000 BTC since late May, a drop of 15.1%. CryptoQuant’s demand momentum indicator, which tracks changes in held balances across participant cohorts, has dropped by 2 million BTC, marking its lowest recorded level. Net spot inflows remain positive but have slowed considerably, with just 118,000 BTC added over the past 30 days compared to 228,000 BTC in May. Both are signs that the market lacks retail participation. Whale accumulation rates have also declined, falling to 1.7% per month from 3.9% previously. Activity in U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs has moderated, with daily net inflows dropping from 9,700 BTC in April to around 3,300 BTC. Combined, this tapering from both retail and institutional segments suggests that the recent equilibrium in Bitcoin’s price is less about strength and more about the absence of directional conviction. Will Bitcoin go back up? Volatility remained elevated heading into the weekend, driven in part by the expiry of $6.8 trillion worth of options tied to stock indexes, ETFs, futures, and individual equities across traditional markets. According to The Kobeissi Letter and SpotGamma, this is potentially the largest triple witching OpEx event ever recorded, and the first such post-holiday expiry in over two decades. Traders had widely anticipated heightened volatility, and Bitcoin’s sudden move late Friday appeared to reflect this build-up. Expectations heading into the session were sharply divided. A poll by analyst Matthew Hyland showed market sentiment nearly split, with 50.2% predicting a drop to $94,000, and 49.8% expecting a rally to $114,000. That divergence reflected broader uncertainty, as Bitcoin briefly surged to $106,500 before reversing course sharply. The brief upside rally cleared out nearby short positions, but the subsequent sell-off triggered a long liquidation cascade, confirming the fragility of leverage-driven rallies in the current environment. Coinglass’s 24-hour liquidation heatmap captured this move in real time. The surge through $106,000 swept through multiple clusters of ask-side liquidity, followed by a steep rejection that liquidated longs stacked between $105,000 and $106,500. Binance BTC/USDT 24-hour liquidation heatmap. Source: CoinGlass. BTC is now consolidating between liquidity-rich zones, with $105,000 and $102,000 acting as short-term magnet levels that could draw price action depending on broader flows. One of the more optimistic voices in the market is Ted Pillows, who recently outlined a Wyckoff accumulation setup developing on Bitcoin’s daily chart. “A breakout above $110,000,” he wrote, “and BTC will rally towards $130K in no time.” BTC/USDC 1-day chart. Source: Ted Pillows According to his chart, Bitcoin has progressed through the latter stages of the Wyckoff cycle, forming a Sign of Strength (SOS) and consolidating around what he labels the Last Point of Support (LPS). A move above resistance would confirm entry into the markup phase, where bullish momentum typically accelerates. Another relatively optimistic outlook comes from market commentator Coinvo, who focuses on Bitcoin’s macro structure. Their analysis tied current price action to long-term trendlines stretching back to 2017 and 2021, suggesting that BTC remains within its historical logarithmic growth channel. Coinvo @ByCoinvo · Follow If everything goes according to plan, $BTC could go to $290,000 by the end of 2025! 👀 10:30 PM · Jun 19, 2025 647 Reply Copy link Read 43 replies Even so, not all analysts are convinced the worst is behind. Justin Bennett offered a more cautious read of recent price action, arguing that the rejection near $106,000 may have trapped late buyers. He warned that a break below local trendline support could drag BTC toward the $101,000 to $99,000 region. Some analysts were watching key technical indicators for signs of weakness. Ether Wizz, for instance, flagged the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA) as a critical level. Since May, this moving average has served as a reliable support zone. BTC/USDT 1-day trading chart. Source: Ether Wizz While bulls managed to defend it again this week, a decisive break below could accelerate a correction toward $98,000. Still, with geopolitical tensions cooling and macro conditions showing early signs of stabilisation, the environment may begin shifting back in favour of risk assets. For Bitcoin, that could mean another attempt to reclaim higher ground, provided buyers step in with conviction. At the time of writing, Bitcoin had erased all of its weekly gains and was trading at $104,216, marking a modest 1.2% loss over the past seven days during late Asian trading hours on June 20. Altcoin market Over the past week, the altcoin market saw a burst of momentum early on, with total market capitalisation climbing 7.2% to reach $1.34 trillion by June 17. However, the rally lost steam in the days that followed, with the market cooling to $1.29 trillion and closing the week with a net gain of 3.2%. Despite the positive headline figure, broader altcoin performance showed signs of fading strength. The Altcoin Season Index dropped to 20 at press time, suggesting that most of the top 100 altcoins are now underperforming relative to Bitcoin. Ethereum, the largest altcoin by market cap, fell 2.2% over the past week as its price fell below $2,500 while its market cap was set at a little above $300 billion. Other large-cap altcoins such as Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and Hyperliquid (HYPE) experienced steeper losses of 2.6%, 6.2%, 8.4%, and 13.7%, respectively, while Tron (TRX) managed to see slight gains in the period. Aerodrome Finance (AERO) stood as the leading gainer of the week, holding on to gains of 32.3% while Kaia (KAIA) and Sei (SEI) posted gains of 22.4% and 17.9% respectively. Source: CoinMarketCap. AERO’s price gains came after Coinbase announced the integration of Base-based DEXs into its main app, potentially exposing Aerodrome to over 10.8 million monthly users and boosting its trading volume and revenue. The token also gained from JPMorgan’s launch of its JPMD deposit token on Base, a move that is accelerating institutional flows into the Base DeFi ecosystem and could drive higher TVL and trading flows to Aerodrome, which currently ranks among the largest liquidity hubs on the network. Kaia’s rally this week was driven by a number of bullish developments. First, USDT, the world’s largest stablecoin by market cap, was launched on the Kaia network this week. Second, Kaia announced plans to launch a Korean won-backed stablecoin in a bid to support South Korea’s push to establish a solid stablecoin economy to counter offshore alternatives. Kaia also became the first Layer‑1 blockchain to onboard the Japan Blockchain Association this week, which added to bullish momentum. As for Sei (SEI), the token gains followed the announcement that the Wyoming Stable Token Commission selected it as one of two candidate blockchains for the state-backed WYST stablecoin. Most decentralised applications on Sei, including Yei Finance and Takara Lend, have also recorded increased adoption in recent weeks.

2025-06-21T09:58:47,"Norway Considers Temporary Ban on Crypto Mining to Address Energy Strain","The Norwegian government is weighing a temporary ban on cryptocurrency mining, citing concerns over electricity consumption, network capacity, and land use. In a notice issued Friday, officials announced that a formal investigation will be conducted in the autumn to evaluate the potential impact of mining operations. The outcome could lead to a temporary halt on such activities, aimed at redirecting resources toward more essential public and industrial needs. The potential ban would be under Norway’s Planning and Building Act, a legislative tool that allows the government to allocate energy usage and infrastructure. “It is uncertain how big a problem crypto mining will become in Norway in the future,” the government said, adding that newly introduced data center regulations requiring registration will help clarify the scope and footprint of crypto-related facilities. Rising Electricity Costs Norwegian households, like many across Europe, have seen a sharp increase in electricity prices over the past two years, largely driven by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent disruption in oil and gas supplies. This has added urgency to national efforts to prioritize energy allocation and limit non-essential power consumption . Local communities have also voiced frustrations over the noise generated by crypto mining farms, with several petitions calling for shutdowns of such operations. While mining may bring in revenue and investment, many argue it offers little social benefit and places an unnecessary burden on already strained infrastructure. Norway to Ban Mining? Norway’s proposal echoes similar moves in other regions. Earlier this year, Russia imposed mining bans across 10 regions to prevent power outages and reduce energy stress. China, once the global leader in Bitcoin mining, implemented a blanket ban in 2021, pushing many miners to relocate to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions like Texas in the United States. Despite ongoing environmental concerns, crypto mining remains legal across most of the U.S., where it continues to contribute significantly to the global Bitcoin hashrate. Lawmakers have raised questions about sustainability, but regulatory action has been sporadic and state-specific. For now, Norway’s move signals a growing shift among European nations toward reevaluating the energy-intensive nature of crypto mining.

2025-06-21T09:48:56,"Bitcoin Falls Below $104K as Retail Investor Sentiment Returns to Liberation Day Levels","Bitcoin (BTC) BTC continues to struggle for direction amid mounting macroeconomic pressures and a notable deterioration in retail investor sentiment. The asset is hovering near $103,700 following a volatile 24-hour stretch, in which it briefly dropped below $103,400 before staging a modest recovery, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. This price behavior reflects an uneasy market backdrop, shaped by both geopolitical tensions and uncertain monetary policy. According to an X post by crypto analytics firm Santiment on Thursday, sentiment among retail investors has turned sharply negative. The firm reported that the ratio of bullish to bearish commentary has fallen to just 1.03 to 1 — the lowest since early April, when the President Donald Trump unveiled his so-called Liberation Day tariffs, triggering peak market fear at the time. Santiment emphasized that this current wave of retail pessimism is unusually intense and, based on past patterns, may mark a contrarian signal for a price rebound. They specifically noted that back in April, Bitcoin rallied shortly after similar fear levels surfaced, suggesting large investors often use periods of retail capitulation to accumulate at favorable prices. Adding to the pressure is the Federal Reserve's recent decision to hold interest rates steady, which has kept btcoin trading in a relatively tight $100,000 to $110,000 range over the past month. Meanwhile, on-chain metrics show declining open interest on Binance, pointing to continued deleveraging among derivatives traders. At the same time, whale wallets have shown steady accumulation since 2023 — an indication that large holders are continuing to build their positions despite the short-term uncertainty. Technical Analysis Highlights BTC-USD traded in a 24-hour range between $106,552.98 and $102,411.01, a 3.89% swing as volatility spiked midday. A sharp drop occurred between 14:00 and 17:00 UTC, pushing price below $104,000 and forming strong resistance near $106,000 on above-average volume. Support emerged between $103,000 and $103,500, where price consolidated on declining volume during the final eight hours of the analysis period. A V-shaped rebound developed late in the session, with BTC rising from $103,363 to $103,618 and establishing a local floor near $103,500. Short-term momentum indicators showed mild recovery as the session closed near intraday highs, but follow-through remained limited.

2025-06-21T09:45:00,"LATAM crypto news: Bit2Me targets Latin American expansion, Paraguay fights Bitcoin extortions","Latin America’s crypto scene continues to evolve, with new products and regional expansions highlighting its rapid growth. This week’s most notable news is that Bit2Me, one of Spain’s biggest crypto exchanges, is planning to expand operations in Latin America. Paraguay, on the other hand, has announced a new effort to combat Bitcoin-based hacking and extortion as the country’s cryptocurrency sector expands. Bit2Me targets Latin American expansion Bit2Me, a renowned cryptocurrency exchange in Spain, has announced plans to expand into Latin America as part of its global growth strategy. The company plans to raise revenue from $24 million in 2024 to $26 million in 2025 through a combination of global expansion and strategic relationships with local banks in major markets such as Argentina, Peru, Brazil, and Mexico. Bit2Me is also planning to reach additional European markets such as Portugal, Italy, and France, aided by its efforts to secure the MiCA license. With over 1.2 million members and €3 billion in transaction volume in 2024, Bit2Me is focusing on compliance and advanced security measures, cementing its position as one of Spain’s most secure exchanges. Cyber attacks surge in Paraguay Paraguay has recently become a common target of cyberattacks, with hackers frequently demanding Bitcoin as a sort of ransom. These attacks, which include the theft of sensitive data and ransomware campaigns, have targeted both public and commercial organisations. The hacking of President Santiago Peña’s official Twitter account resulted in a false announcement about Bitcoin legalisation, causing alarm. Although the account was immediately restored, the breach exposed the country’s digital weaknesses and the growing complexity of cyber attacks. In response to these growing risks, Paraguay implemented the National Cybersecurity Strategy 2025-2028. Gustavo Villate, Minister of Information and Communication Technologies, spearheads the plan, which focuses on critical infrastructure protection, cybersecurity training, and international cooperation. The Armed Forces are also playing an important part in the implementation. The strategy intends to make Paraguay’s digital ecosystem more secure by decreasing human error and strengthening institutional resilience. However, its success is dependent on excellent execution and collaboration with allies such as the United States, Israel, and Taiwan. Brazil’s B3 exchange launches Ethereum and Solana futures B3, Brazil’s biggest stock exchange, announced futures contracts for Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) on Monday, boosting its portfolio of regulated cryptoassets as demand for blockchain-based financial products grows. The new derivatives represent a significant step for B3, which has been progressively establishing a regulated crypto market ecosystem in Latin America’s largest economy. The contracts will be priced in US dollars and reference the Nasdaq Ether and Nasdaq Solana Reference Prices. This development is a significant milestone for Brazil’s financial system, demonstrating the country’s willingness to incorporate regulated cryptocurrency products within a regular exchange structure. By providing advanced tools to both institutional and retail investors, B3 is positioning Brazil as a regional leader in crypto finance while also encouraging innovation in the country’s expanding digital asset ecosystem.

Long-term forecasts suggest potential highs of $35.60 by 2030. Worldcoin made waves in early 2024 when its token WLD nearly hit $12, but since then, it has struggled to break past key resistance levels, even during bullish market events. With price action losing steam and investor interest fading, many wonder if the project is losing its shine. As it is backed by Sam Altman and focused on decentralized identity, Worldcoin is quietly building in the background. working hard in silence, maybe with the ongoing AI crypto bull run gaining momentum, Sam Altman’s brainchild, Worldcoin, could possibly create a significant buzz. As AI narratives gain traction, many are intrigued to know, “What does the future hold for Worldcoin?” or “Could WLD stage a comeback?” Let’s delve into the anticipated Worldcoin price predictions for 2025 to 2030 and the years to come Table of contents Overview CoinPedia’s WLD Price Prediction Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025 WLD Price Forecast 2026 – 2030 Worldcoin Price Forecast 2026 WLD Price Prediction 202 7 Worldcoin Price Forecast 2028 WLD AI Token Price Forecast 2029 Worldcoin AI Token Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency WorldCoin WDC Token WDC Price $ 0.00349731 -10.28% Market Cap $ 0.00 Circulating Supply 0.00 Trading Volume $ 5.1958 All-time High $11.82 on 10th March 2024 All-time Low $0.9758 on 13th September 2023 CoinPedia’s WLD Price Prediction As per Coinpedia’s Worldcoin Price Prediction, marketers’ optimism and the involvement of high-profile figures could significantly boost Worldcoin’s potential value. Further, this credibility and backing, combined with a potential increase in trading volume, could drive the price of WLD Coin to an impressive $5.89 by the end of 2025. If the market faces external pressures, then it could potentially drive the price down to a low of $1.61 . Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2025 1.61 3.25 5.89 Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025 The Q2 2025 price action for Worldcoin (WLD) clearly showed signs of exhaustion before it could push higher. Despite recent optimism, its inability to establish a sustained, long-term bullish trend remains evident. Looking at its historical performance, the recent Q2’s gains appear modest, like a mere bucket of water from a deep well. Since early 2024, WLD is still down over 80% from its highs, even with the latest price surge. The entire weekly price action on the Binance exchange resembles a converging price action structure in a falling channel. This pattern occurrence highlights the odds of future good returns remaining high. When a catalyst activates, it will shoot a breakout from this range. Many are now asking: What could truly push Worldcoin higher? As seen time and again in the crypto space, social sentiment is often the key driver. Renewed marketing efforts and the involvement of high-profile figures could significantly enhance Worldcoin’s value. If, in the coming sessions, optimistic momentum builds up, then WLD must achieve a Change of Character (ChoCh) in its current price structure by breaking above the $2.12 level in June or July. Once this level is cleared and a ChoCh is confirmed, Worldcoin could break out of its bearish pattern and potentially retest the $4.18 level by the end of 2025. However, if WLD fails to maintain a bullish trajectory this year, its price could drop as low as $0.70.

2025-06-21T09:32:13,"Bitcoin Demand Momentum Shows Bears Are Giving Up – Price Reversal Ahead?","The post Bitcoin Demand Momentum Shows Bears Are Giving Up – Price Reversal Ahead? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News June 21, 2025 – Bitcoin might be gearing up for a massive breakout—and it’s not just about technical patterns or ETF news this time. A sharp shift in demand momentum and rising Global Liquidity Index (GLI) has caught the eye of veteran analyst Crypto Rover. Let’s break down what the latest signals are telling us. Bears Are Backing Off, Bulls Taking Over According to a chart shared by Crypto Rover, Bitcoin’s demand momentum has plunged deep into negative territory. In simple words, short-term sellers are pulling back, while long-term holders are stepping in. Historically, this kind of shift tends to happen near market bottoms, often just before big price rallies. The bears are capitulating. Bitcoin demand momentum is deep in the red. A reversal is imminent! pic.twitter.com/3Nf0GmTJDH — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) June 21, 2025 At the same time, Bitcoin’s trading volume jumped 20% in the past 24 hours, reaching $47 billion. The spike in volume reflects a mix of panic selling and opportunistic buying, a classic sign of bear capitulation. Adding to the bullish signs, major players are placing bold bets. One whale, in particular, is holding a massive 20x long position on Bitcoin , valued at over $364.35 million, reflecting a growing confidence in BTC. Liquidity and Bitcoin in Sync Interestingly, Rover also compared recent Bitcoin’s price to global liquidity trends. Historically, when global liquidity rises, Bitcoin tends to follow suit, sometimes with explosive results. Notably, the current Global Liquidity Index (GLI) level mirrors the period when Bitcoin was trading around $100,000, implying that if the pattern holds, Bitcoin could soon revisit or even surpass this price point. Bitcoin will explode. Just like the global liquidity did.

Volume Trends: Sustained high trading volumes could confirm that the capitulation phase is ending, signaling that selling pressure is subsiding. Support Levels: The $103,400 level remains a critical support zone. Holding above this threshold is essential for a bullish reversal. Technical Indicators: Watch for bullish crossovers in the MACD and RSI moving out of oversold territory, currently at 45 . As of now, Bitcoin is trading around $103.693, reflecting a drop of 2.2% seen in the last 24 hours, with a market cap hitting $2.06 trillion. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-21T09:30:53,"Norway Weighs Temporary Ban on Crypto Mining to Conserve Energy","Norway is exploring the possibility of imposing a temporary ban on cryptocurrency mining operations as part of a broader effort to safeguard national energy resources and improve the allocation of electricity. The country’s government announced Friday that it will conduct a detailed investigation this autumn to evaluate the impact of crypto mining on power consumption and local infrastructure. This process could ultimately lead to a temporary halt in mining operations. Officials cited the Planning and Building Act, a national legal framework that enables the government to control energy use and zoning policies, as the basis for such an action. “It is uncertain how big a problem crypto mining will become in Norway in the future,” the government said in a statement. They added that new regulations requiring registration of data centers involved in mining would provide authorities with greater insight into the scale and scope of the industry. Rising Energy Demands Prompt Policy Review The proposal comes amid growing energy concerns across Europe. Many residents in Norway have experienced significant increases in electricity costs, a trend exacerbated by the ongoing war in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russian oil and gas supplies. Local communities have also raised objections to crypto mining facilities due to noise pollution and their impact on residential life. In response to these pressures, some Norwegian regions have already begun pushing for tighter regulations or outright shutdowns of such operations. A Broader Pattern of Global Crackdowns Norway’s deliberation reflects a growing international trend. Countries around the world are becoming increasingly wary of the environmental and energy consequences of crypto mining. Russia, for example, enacted a ban on mining in ten regions earlier this year in an effort to prevent blackouts and lower electricity usage. In China, a sweeping nationwide ban introduced in 2021 forced miners to migrate their operations to other jurisdictions, including parts of the United States. Despite environmental concerns and public scrutiny, crypto mining remains legal across most U.S. states, making the country one of the leading contributors to the global Bitcoin hashrate. However, voices within the U.S. political landscape have continued to criticize the industry’s environmental footprint, fueling calls for greater regulatory oversight. Energy Policy and Environmental Impact Under Scrutiny For Norway, the challenge lies in balancing its goals for digital innovation and energy conservation. As the country continues to support a digital economy, policymakers appear to be reevaluating how much power can be devoted to non-essential or highly energy-intensive sectors like crypto mining. The government emphasized that the upcoming investigation will help it make data-driven decisions regarding the sustainability and scale of mining activities. While no immediate bans have been enforced, the potential for such measures signals a growing readiness to act if crypto mining begins to overwhelm Norway’s power grid or interfere with long-term environmental goals.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/norway-weighs-temporary-ban-on-crypto-mining-to-conserve-energy/,"ASIA|BTC|COMMODITY|MINING|REGULATION","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare
2025-06-21T09:30:17,"XRP Price Crash Tests Critical Support At $2.1, Will It Break?","After the market crash that sent the Bitcoin price falling toward $100,000, the XRP price also saw a notable decline, and this crash has brought it toward an important level. While the digital asset continues to hold above the $2.1 level, it remains critical support and a break below this could be negative for the price. This is outlined by crypto analyst The Alchemist Trader, who has shown what direction the XRP price could be headed in depending on what happens here. XRP Price Threatens Major Support Level After the almost 4.5% decline that ravaged the XRP price over the last week, it has been pushed down toward the next major support level, lying just above $2.09. So far, the bulls have defended this level, but the multiple tests suggest that a breakdown at this level could be in view. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts 20% Ethereum Price Crash Below $2,000, Here’s Why The analyst explains that the reason this level is so important is that it actually includes the value area low recorded in previous declines. Additionally, it is the 200-day moving average (MA) for the cryptocurrency, and also now serves as a key daily support/resistance flip. This means either camp of the bulls and bears can pull it in their direction, making it incredibly important for what happens to the XRP price in the short term. Given the importance of this level, whether it holds or breaks will carry serious implications for the XRP price. In the bearish scenario, the crypto analyst explains that a break below this support would trigger a liquidity sweep as the price dumps lower. The possibility of a break is even higher now, given that this level has already been tested multiple times. The Alchemist explains that each test weakens the level, putting it at risk of a breakdown. However, with long consolidation so far above this level, there is a bullish scenario that is rising. As bulls continue to maintain this support, further strength here could erode the possibility of a decline. If properly defended with a notable uptick in volume, in addition to a move upward into the recent local highs at $2.4, then it is likely that the XRP price continues to move up. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Wave Towards ATH Coming? Here Are The Targets “For bulls, a clean defense of this level with volume and a move back above recent local highs would indicate a potential rotation toward the next resistance,” the analysis read. “For bears, a breakdown without a reclaim increases the likelihood of continuation to the downside.” As for how to play the current trend, the analyst advises investors to exercise caution and wait for confirmation before taking positions. The confirmation here would either be a break below the support or a strong upward rally away from it, signaling a clear direction.

2025-06-21T09:15:50,"Litecoin, XRP and Solana ETF Applications Have 95% Chance of Approval This Year: Bloomberg Analysts","Litecoin ( LTC ), XRP and Solana ( SOL ) exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications all have overwhelming odds of approval this year, according to Bloomberg ETF analysts. James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas now say on the social media platform X that those three altcoins have a 95% chance of securing ETFs in 2025. They also give potential Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Cardano ( ADA ), Polkadot ( DOT ), Hedera ( HBAR ) and Avalanche ( AVAX ) ETFs a 90% chance of approval. A Sui ( SUI ) ETF application from the crypto asset manager Canary Capital has slightly lower odds, at 60%, and a Canary Tron ( TRX ) bid doesn’t have any chance in 2025, according to the analysts. Source: James Seyffart/X Seyffart also notes that Ethereum ( ETH ) staking ETFs are also “extremely likely” to be approved in 2025. Numerous other ETF applications have been filed for potential funds based on Axelar ( AXL ), BNB , Aptos ( APT ), Chainlink ( LINK ), Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ), Official Trump ( TRUMP ), Melania ( MELANIA ) and Bonk ( BONK ). Other potential new ETFs are tied to a basket of currencies, and a few are based on Bitcoin ( BTC ) and/or Ethereum, assets that have already been approved for inclusion in other spot ETFs. The SEC greenlit the first spot market Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, bringing in billions of dollars worth of inflows to the top digital asset by market cap. The regulator subsequently approved Ethereum ETFs for trading last July.

2025-06-21T09:08:55,"Bitcoin’s plunge triggered $495 million in liquidations","Bitcoin (BTC) plummeted to its lowest point this week, triggering almost half a billion worth of liquidations and rattling the crypto market as geopolitical tensions and heavy selling pressure spooked traders. The BTC price slipped back to the $102k zone before regaining the crucial $103k mark. The global digital assets market cap dropped by 2% over the past 24 hours to stand at $3.2 trillion. Its 24-hour trading volume surged by 40% to hit $112 billion, suggesting that traders are moving their funds quickly amid surging uncertainties. However, the fear and greed index flashes “neutral” sentiment among the investors. Liquidations soar to $500M The day that began with Bitcoin hitting $106K saw it dropping below $103,000 in a matter of hours. The pullback wasn’t limited to BTC as Ethereum (ETH) plunged by as much as 4.5% in just a couple of hours. ETH price fell to a low of $2,375 as its trading volumes spiked by 89% to hit $22 billion. Ether is trading at an average price of $2,425 with a marginal recovery. Solana, Cardano, and the biggest meme crypto, Dogecoin, were also swept up in the selloff. Their price dropped between 3% and 5% during the same session. Meanwhile, Sei has turned out to be the biggest gainer among the top 100 crypto. Sei price is up by 10% in the last 24 hours and is trading around $0.22 at press time. The sell-off has triggered widespread liquidations across the crypto derivatives market. CoinGlass data shows that 127k traders got liquidated over the last 24 hours, as the liquidations went on to hit $495 million. The single largest liquidation order of BTC/USD valued at $8 million happened on Bybit. Source: CoinGlass Around $413 million worth of liquidated positions (84%) turn out to be long bets. This suggests that traders were hoping that bullish momentum would continue ahead, but the cumulative crypto market printed red indexes. Ethereum liquidations outpaced Bitcoin’s, totaling $177 million compared to Bitcoin’s $122 million. Bitcoin is trading at an average price of $103,485 at press time, which traders have been watching closely for a while. Its 24-hour trading volume is up by 34% to stand at $48.8 billion. Bitcoin’s overheating zone cleared? According to CryptoQuant data , the heatmap chart tells the story that the $103K liquidation cluster, which previously acted as a concentration point for overleveraged long positions, was completely dismantled. As Bitcoin broke through this key level, a sharp wick pushed prices below $102,500, flushing out traders who had entered long positions with insufficient margin or poor risk management. Binance’s liquidation delta chart corroborates this move, showing a pronounced spike of over $160 million in long liquidations within minutes of the breakdown. Simultaneously, Binance’s Net Taker Volume, smoothed over a seven-hour moving average. It plunged deeply into negative territory, hitting nearly negative $100 million. It’s the third time this month the metric has nosedived to such extremes. The metric showed that the sell-off may have felt brutal in the moment, but events like these can ultimately be constructive. Aggressive liquidations and deep negative taker volumes typically signal that speculative excess has been flushed from the system. It suggests that the removal of weak-handed leverage can make the way for more stable price action.
