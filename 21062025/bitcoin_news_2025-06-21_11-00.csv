2025-06-21T08:55:12,"CoinMarketCap Hacked, Scrambles to Remove Malicious Wallet Verification Popup","CoinMarketCap was hacked on Friday after a malicious popup appeared on its website, urging users to “verify” their wallets. Key Takeaways: CoinMarketCap was hacked after a fake wallet verification popup appeared on its site, triggering phishing concerns. MetaMask and Phantom flagged the site as unsafe, warning users against connecting wallets. The breach has revived criticism of CoinMarketCap’s security, nearly four years after its major data leak. The phishing-style notification asked users to connect their wallets and approve ERC-20 token access, raising immediate red flags across the crypto community. Wallet providers like MetaMask and Phantom quickly flagged the site as unsafe, with Phantom displaying a browser warning against using the platform. CoinMarketCap Removes Malicious Popup In a Friday post on X , CoinMarketCap confirmed the removal of the malicious popup. “We’ve identified and removed the malicious code from our site,” the platform said. The company added that it is continuing to investigate the breach and is reinforcing its security measures to prevent similar incidents. Update: We've identified and removed the malicious code from our site. Our team is continuing to investigate and taking steps to strengthen our security. — CoinMarketCap (@CoinMarketCap) June 21, 2025 The malicious prompt, which triggered warnings from wallet providers like MetaMask and Phantom, reportedly asked users to connect their wallets and approve access to ERC-20 tokens. Phantom’s browser extension even flagged CoinMarketCap as “unsafe to use,” raising concerns about the platform’s vulnerability. Reports of the phishing attempt began circulating across crypto social media, with several users alerting others not to interact with the prompt. Many suspected the attack was an attempt to steal wallet credentials through a fake interface mimicking a legitimate verification process. The incident has reignited concerns about CoinMarketCap’s security, coming nearly four years after a 2021 data breach exposed the email addresses of over 3.1 million users. That data was later discovered for sale on hacking forums, prompting criticism over the platform’s safeguards. SECURITY ALERT We're seeing reports that @CoinMarketCap 's front end has been compromised and is trying to trick people into linking their wallets, presumably to drain them. pic.twitter.com/a0JREDSPvS — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) June 20, 2025 CoinMarketCap, owned by Binance, remains one of the most widely used resources in the crypto space, making it a prime target for malicious actors looking to exploit its credibility. Users are urged to avoid connecting wallets to unsolicited prompts and to verify all interactions through official channels. The company has not disclosed the source of the breach but has committed to ongoing security reviews. Crypto Crime Turns Violent as Illicit Transactions Top $40B in 2024 Illicit cryptocurrency activity surged to at least $40.9 billion in 2024, according to Chainalysis, with the number likely to grow as more criminal-linked wallets are identified. Hacks alone accounted for $2.2 billion in stolen assets, a 21% increase from the previous year. North Korean-linked groups, including Lazarus and Tradetraitor, were behind over 60% of those thefts, with major incidents like the $300 million hack of Japan’s DMM Bitcoin exchange among their hits. But the threats go beyond online exploits. Criminal groups are using crypto to fund and conceal a wider range of crimes—from investment scams and AI-enhanced romance frauds to drug trafficking and even physical violence. In one alarming case on May 13, 2025, the daughter and grandson of Paymium’s CEO were nearly kidnapped in Paris by masked men.

2025-06-21T08:52:02,"Bitcoin Price Slides to $103K as Major Altcoins Crash (Weekend Watch)","The broader cryptocurrency market continues struggling amid mounting geopolitical and economic pressures. Bitcoin’s price has lost almost 3% on the day, while major altcoins such as Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, and others chart even more considerable declines. Bitcoin Price Tumbles toward $103K Bitcoin is charting a near 3% loss in the past 24 hours in what seems to be a broader crypto market selloff. As seen in the chart below, the price tumbled from around $106,000 to an intraday low at $102,400 before bouncing and settling at where it current trades at the time of this writing. Source: TradingView As CryptoPotato reported, however, the common theme amongst the majority of cryptocurrency analysts and experts is that Bitcoin’s price trading at around $100,000 is indicative of institutional dominance and not retail FOMO. This suggests that it has much more staying power because institutions are a lot less likely to sell during temporary and sudden drawdowns like the current one. At the same time, however, the war between Israel and Iran continues , driving oil prices up and causing turmoil on stock markets as well. Altcoins Crash Harder than BTC The heatmap below paints a clear picture: most of the altcoins are trading in the red and are charting consiedrable losses. Namely, some of the larger-cap cryptocurrencies such as ETH, SOL, ADA, DOGE, HYPE, BCH, LINK, AVAX, and more, are declining for more than 3% during the past 24 hours. Interestingly enough, Bitcoin’s dominance – the metric, which tracks its share relative to that of the rest of the market is up by more than 1% during the same period. This shows that BTC is performing a lot better and altcoins are completely unable to capitalize on its drawdown. In fact, this seems to be the other theme of the current cycle.

2025-06-21T08:45:58,"Hedera Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will HBAR Price Hit $0.5?","The post Hedera Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will HBAR Price Hit $0.5? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights The live price of Hedera crypto is $ 0.14528571 . Hedera Price prediction highlights HBAR could reach $0.750 by the end of 2025 if bullish trends continue. The Long-term forecasts suggest HBAR could hit $2.20 by 2030, indicating stable growth potential. Hedera has been making waves in the crypto space, having entered the top 20 digital assets by market cap in 2024, and now eyeing a potential leap into the top 10 by the end of 2025. With increasing real-world use cases, institutional interest, and strategic partnerships, many are closely tracking HBAR price prediction 2025 to gauge how high the token can rise. With major companies like Google, IBM, and Chainlink Labs backing the project, and talks of an HBAR ETF approval, many are asking: Will HBAR Price Hit $1? Table of Contents Story Highlights Overview Hedera Price Projection 2025 HBAR Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 HBAR Price Prediction 2026 HBAR Price Forecast 2027 Hedera Price Forecast 2028 HBAR Price Target 2029 Hedera Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis Coinpedia’s Hedera Price Prediction FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency. Hedera Token. HBAR Price. $ 0.14528571 -2.35% Market Cap. $ 6,136,862,718.1847 Trading Volume. $ 110,903,647.4179 Circulating Supply. 42,239,959,710.73 All-time high. $0.5701 (September 16th, 2021). All-time low. $0.01001 (January 2nd, 2020). Hedera Price Projection 2025 Since peaking at $0.40 in mid-January 2025, the HBAR price has been on a steady decline. External factors dragged it into a falling wedge pattern, reaching a low of $0.125 in early April. However, from the second week of April, a broader crypto rally lifted HBAR as well. It broke out of the wedge, rebounding from a strong support zone, the same area that fueled the Q4 2024 rally. This zone, confirmed by the FRVP indicator, showed high buying interest and supported a sharp rebound. HBAR surged nearly 80%, climbing from $0.125 to $0.228 in April to mid-May. But the momentum didn’t hold. Over the last 40 days, HBAR dropped around 35%, with 21% of that loss occurring in just 10 days. Currently, HBAR is forming another falling wedge with its price trading near its lower boundary, and inching to retest the high-demand zone again. If bulls regain strength, at this zone, then in June or July, HBAR could retest the $0.19 resistance area. A breakout above this resistance area could follow, potentially reaching $0.27 in the upcoming Q3. Looking further ahead, a daily close above $0.27 could open the path to $0.40. If momentum continues, HBAR might even touch $0.75 by year-end. On the downside, failure to hold support may push the price down toward $0.072. Meanwhile, internal developments tell a different story. Hedera’s ecosystem continues to grow. In 2025, it launched its first native hardware wallet, Citadel , and an AI-based tool, the Hedera Agent Kit , making token creation more accessible. Another major project, HashSphere, is due in Q3 2025. It aims to offer a private, regulated blockchain for stablecoin-based payments and asset management. To streamline operations, Hedera also rebranded key entities on May 15. The HBAR Foundation is now the “Hedera Foundation,” and the Governing Council is the “Hedera Council.” In short, while external pressures weigh on price, Hedera’s internal progress remains strong. If macro conditions improve, 2025 could still bring a major turnaround.

2025-06-21T08:23:19,"Cardano’s Treasury Strategy Targets Bitcoin DeFi Boom","The post Cardano’s Treasury Strategy Targets Bitcoin DeFi Boom appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Cardano is making strategic moves to strengthen its DeFi ecosystem, backed by solid fundamentals and community support. With its treasury holding around 1.7 billion ADA, founder Charles Hoskinson has laid out plans to convert a portion into stablecoins to fuel liquidity and long-term growth. However this new proposal has ignited discussion in the Cardano ecosystem , suggesting a strategic deployment of the blockchain’s billion-dollar treasury to bring in both Bitcoin and stablecoin liquidity. Andrew Throuvalas, a researcher and Bitcoin advocate, believes Cardano is uniquely positioned to lead the next phase of Bitcoin DeFi, and the moment to act is now. CARDANO TREASURY DEBATE: BITCOIN AND STABLECOINS Here's my perspective as a Bitcoiner who a) has a majority BTC position, and b) wants to put it into DeFi. Cardano community should ABSOLUTELY deploy treasury funds toward intelligent efforts to bring both BTC and… pic.twitter.com/hWWaVtydew — Andrew | BitcoinOS (@AThrouvalas) June 20, 2025 Meanwhile, Cardano adoption is rising fast, with 110 million transactions and 22 billion ADA staked across 3,000 pools, showing strong community and growing DeFi activity. Built for Bitcoin DeFi but Missing Liquidity Cardano’s architecture shares key similarities with Bitcoin, and its DeFi infrastructure has proven secure and reliable over time. Projects like BitcoinOS and Charms are laying the foundation for bridgeless Bitcoin integration on Cardano, which could support what Throuvalas describes as a $2 trillion DeFi opportunity for Bitcoin. Loopholes? However, two major gaps remain. Cardano currently lacks deep stablecoin liquidity, making it difficult for institutions or large holders to operate at scale without experiencing slippage. In addition, competing ecosystems such as Arbitrum are rapidly building towards similar goals, while Cardano’s unique advantages remain underappreciated by the broader crypto market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Crash Coming! Altcoins to Drop 50–80%, Bitcoin to Face 45% Crash , Stablecoin Pools and BTC Incentives Proposed To close this gap, Throuvalas proposes allocating treasury funds to leading Cardano protocols such as Minswap, Liqwid Finance, and Indigo Protocol. By building large stablecoin pools, these platforms could offer Bitcoin holders the ability to borrow against their BTC more effectively, a critical use case for Bitcoin DeFi participants. He further suggests converting a portion of the ADA treasury into Bitcoin and using it to pay out yield directly in BTC. This would reward users who bring their Bitcoin to the Cardano network. As a precedent, Babylon has already attracted more than $4.5 billion in BTC with similar mechanisms, even though yields are paid in tokens rather than Bitcoin itself. A Timely Opportunity for Cardano Throuvalas believes this approach could significantly boost activity on Cardano and establish it as a long-term hub for Bitcoin DeFi. With its secure infrastructure and untapped treasury, the network could capture lasting value and demand for ADA if it moves quickly to attract Bitcoin liquidity. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

While the intent is to boost liquidity, converting a large ADA amount could create short-term selling pressure. However, proponents argue the market is deep enough to absorb it without significant price impact. What are the potential risks of converting ADA into stablecoins and Bitcoin now? Risks include potential short-term price volatility for ADA due to sales, and the stablecoin market itself carries inherent volatility and regulatory risks. It could also signal a lack of confidence in ADA’s long-term value to some. Could this move attract institutional investors, and if so, what additional infrastructure or compliance measures would be needed? Yes, increased stablecoin and Bitcoin liquidity could attract institutions. This would require robust institutional-grade compliance, security, and potentially tailored financial products like tokenized real-world assets.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/cardanos-treasury-strategy-targets-bitcoin-defi-boom/,"ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION","News|Altcoins",cryptocompare
2025-06-21T08:23:03,"Exploring the Next Wave of Potential Crypto Millionaires by December 2025","As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, certain digital tokens stand out for their potential to generate significant financial returns by December 2025.

Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Bitcoin: Pioneering a New Era of Digital Currency Bitcoin, often dubbed the world's first cryptocurrency, has revolutionized the way we think about money. Introduced by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, it offers a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that operates without a central authority. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin isn't printed or minted; it's a digital asset maintained by a distributed network of computers called nodes. Transactions are verified by miners through a process of solving complex puzzles, ensuring the integrity and security of the network. This innovative system removes the need for intermediaries like banks, making transactions faster and potentially more secure. As we navigate the current market cycle, Bitcoin's potential continues to spark interest. The network undergoes a ""halving"" approximately every four years, reducing the reward for miners by half. This process, designed to cap the total supply at 21 million bitcoins, can influence the network's stability and mining profitability. Compared to newer cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin remains the most established and widely recognized. Its limited supply and increasing adoption suggest a resilient future, though the market remains volatile. Whether Bitcoin is an attractive option now depends on individual perspectives, but its pioneering technology and growing role in the financial world are hard to ignore. ADA Coin: Cardano's Green Revolution in the Crypto World Cardano is shaking up the cryptocurrency scene. It's a platform built for smart contracts, making it easy to create apps, tokens, and games without middlemen. Its coin, ADA, competes with Ethereum's ETH. With ADA, users can store value, make payments, and help secure the network by staking. What makes Cardano special is its eco-friendly approach. It uses proof-of-stake, which is much more energy-efficient than the methods used by many other cryptocurrencies. In today's market, ADA shows great promise. Cardano's technology allows fast transactions, potentially handling up to a million per second. This speed comes from its unique two-layer system, separating transactions from smart contracts. Since 2021, Cardano's native tokens have made interactions with smart contracts safer and cheaper. As the crypto world moves towards sustainability and efficiency, ADA stands out. It's an attractive option for those interested in the future of cryptocurrency. Monero: Your Money, Your Business Monero (XMR) was launched in 2014 with a clear goal: to let people make private transactions. While many think Bitcoin hides their identity, it's actually easy to trace payments back because blockchains are open for all to see. Monero changes this by using advanced cryptography to hide both the sender and the receiver. The team behind Monero puts privacy and security first. They want everyone to have protection, no matter how tech-savvy they are. Monero aims to let payments happen quickly and cheaply, without fear of censorship. In a world where digital footprints are everywhere, Monero offers a way to keep your financial dealings to yourself. This makes it stand out from other cryptocurrencies that are less private. With growing concerns about data privacy, Monero's technology has big potential. In the current market, where regulations are tightening, a coin like Monero could become more attractive. It provides a level of anonymity that others don't. As more people seek privacy, Monero might see increased interest compared to more transparent coins. Chainlink: Bridging Blockchains with the Real World Chainlink is changing how smart contracts work. It connects them to real-world data, like prices and events. This makes them more useful and powerful. Chainlink uses a network of oracles to fetch and verify data. These oracles have a reputation score to ensure the data is accurate. The system combines on-chain and off-chain processes. On-chain, it manages data requests. Off-chain, it gathers the data. The LINK token powers this ecosystem. It rewards those who provide data and keeps the network secure through staking. In the current market, Chainlink stands out. Its ability to connect blockchains with external data fills a crucial gap. As more decentralized apps emerge, the need for reliable data grows. Unlike some coins that offer limited utility, LINK has a clear purpose. Its technology is mature compared to newer projects. With the increasing focus on DeFi and real-world asset tokenization, Chainlink's role becomes even more important. Investing in LINK could be attractive for those looking at long-term growth in the crypto space. Conclusion While BTC, ADA, XMR, and LINK are strong choices this quarter, XYZVerse ($XYZ) stands out as a pioneering sports memecoin aiming for remarkable growth.

2025-06-21T08:17:05,"Expert Makes Bullish $100 XRP Price Scenario","The Modern Investor, a popular voice in the cryptocurrency space, has argued that XRP’s price, hovering around $2.16, is a clear indication that the crypto market is still in its early stages. He made this statement in a recent video , where he compared XRP’s present value to Bitcoin’s current price of just over $104,000, emphasizing that both assets are still far below where many believe they are ultimately headed. According to him, the absence of a $100 XRP or a multi-million-dollar Bitcoin reinforces the idea that digital assets have significant ground left to cover. This view is not based on short-term trends but on long-term expectations shaped by earlier forecasts and multi-cycle price growth projections. Long-Term Growth Is Achievable Rather than dismiss the idea of XRP reaching $100 , The Modern Investor acknowledged its potential, even if the timeline remains uncertain. He referred to past predictions that estimated such growth might occur over several market cycles. While those forecasts were speculative, he argued they were not implausible. He noted that many retail participants often misunderstand the value of long-term strategy in crypto. Price appreciation does not usually occur overnight, but those who invest early and remain consistent have historically been rewarded. His message was intended to refocus investor attention on patience and steady accumulation. Cost Barriers for XRP Accumulation Rising Quickly A major point in his discussion centered on the growing difficulty of acquiring large quantities of XRP. He cited an often-mentioned target of holding 10,000 XRP, a benchmark introduced by analyst Edoardo Farina. Currently, this amount would require an investment of over $21,000. Both The Modern Investor and Farina agree that while this target was once accessible, it has become increasingly out of reach for most people. The original intention may have been to encourage early participation, but the numbers today no longer reflect a typical investor’s capacity. According to Farina, acquiring such a position may soon become impossible for nearly all retail participants. The Door Has Not Closed for Determined Buyers Despite rising costs, The Modern Investor believes the market still offers opportunity. He mentioned that many of his viewers began accumulating digital assets in small amounts several years ago and are now well-positioned, even if they never reached the 10,000 XRP mark. He also pointed to recent data showing that holding just over 11,000 XRP puts investors in the top 4% globally, showing how even modest portfolios can lead to significant standing in the ecosystem through regular market growth and passive income strategies like staking .

2025-06-21T08:16:10,"U.S. Policy Is Moving Slow—But Crypto Traders Aren’t Waiting!","The post U.S. Policy Is Moving Slow—But Crypto Traders Aren’t Waiting! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News While crypto investors often look to Washington for clues about the next big market move, it seems that public emotions and crowd behavior might be playing an even bigger role. With U.S. interest rates on hold, spending bills, and stablecoin rules, the crypto market often moves faster than the news itself. But the bigger question remains—are traders reacting to real changes or reacting to what they expect will happen? Fed Says ‘No Cut Yet’ When the Federal Reserve recently held rates steady at 4.25%–4.50% , nobody was surprised. But many crypto investors had secretly hoped for hints of future rate cuts. That didn’t happen. Fed Chair Jerome Powell played it safe, saying they’ll wait and watch inflation. This lack of clarity left crypto investors uncertain. Bitcoin, which had climbed as high as $112,000 the previous week, dropped 8% and hovered around $104,000. This shows that the market had likely “priced in” the Fed’s decision ahead of time. Interestingly, altcoins like Solana, XRP, and Cardano, which usually react more sharply to market news, remained relatively stable. According to Santiment’s on-chain data , traders appear to be following a pattern of “sell the rumor, buy the news,” reflecting indecision in a market waiting for a clearer direction. GENIUS Act Brings Hope and Worry to Stablecoin Another major update is the GENIUS Act, a bill passed by the U.S. Senate. It’s designed to bring clear rules to stablecoins like USDC and USDT. The bill says these tokens must be backed by real dollars and overseen by trusted financial regulators. If it becomes law, it’ll force companies like Circle and Coinbase to follow strict rules and hold real-dollar reserves. So far, social sentiment is bullish. But traders had already bought the rumor. If the House delays the bill, or nothing major follows, we could see prices cool off. Bitcoin and the ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ The U.S. government’s massive spending plan, dubbed the “Big Beautiful Bill,” has reignited Bitcoin’s inflation hedge story. With fears of more money printing, many are turning to BTC as a way to protect their savings.

2025-06-21T08:08:27,"Connecticut teen admits role in $245 million Bitcoin heist","A Connecticut man has pleaded guilty to participating in a theft of $245 million in Bitcoin. According to reports, the suspect, Veer Chetal, pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering conspiracy charges after his parents were kidnapped. According to court documents that were unsealed this week, 19-year-old Chetal from Danbury, Connecticut, has also agreed to testify against his co-defendants. The Connecticut native was one of three men charged in an online scam last August, stealing about 4,100 Bitcoins from their victim, a resident in Washington D.C. Reports claimed that the trio used the proceeds from the heist to live a luxury lifestyle, spending millions on cars, jewelry, rental mansions and nightclub parties. Connecticut native docked for Bitcoin theft after parents’ kidnap According to authorities, a week after Chetal and his co-conspirators carried out the crime, his parents were kidnapped and assaulted. Although the attack failed, authorities believed that the attacker had aimed to use the kidnap to coerce Chetal, who they believed had a large amount of digital assets, into using part of the funds to secure his parents’ release. Chetal’s parents were said to be in their new Lamborghini SUV when the attackers forced them out and assaulted them. Police, at the time, mentioned that after they were taken, the attackers bound them and forced them into their waiting van. Witnesses immediately called the police. The police were able to react quickly, arresting four men after they abandoned their vehicles and the van to flee on foot. Two other suspects were later arrested at a nearby home the group rented through an Airbnb, authorities said. During the hearing, one of the defendants, Michael Rivas, apologized for his actions. He said it was a dumb idea and he only did it to help one of the co-defendants who had a vendetta, although he did not elaborate. Meanwhile, his lawyer said that he only accepted to be a part of the gang in hopes of getting a share of the loot. At the time, there were reports of a Bitcoin theft where the assailants had been reportedly involved in a massive spending spree. Chetal agrees to testify against his co-defendants The criminal case involving the Connecticut native was unsealed on Monday in a Washington federal court, revealing his guilty plea in November and an agreement to cooperate with federal authorities investigating the Bitcoin theft. It also revealed the prosecutors are looking into new allegations that he was involved in about 50 other thefts where he stole more than $3 million from November 2023 to September 2024. Authorities also claimed that Chetal was also involved in a $2 million crypto theft that took place in October, but refused to tell them about it. Last September, federal agents with a search warrant raided the Connecticut native’s Brunswick, New Jersey apartment and his parent’s home in Danbury in connection to the Bitcoin theft. Investigators mentioned that they found more than $500,000 in cash, expensive jewelry and watches, and luxury clothes. Federal agents also added that Chetal had about $39 million worth of digital assets that he turned over to investigators. Authorities claimed that Chetal could face deportation as part of the criminal case. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Historically, Bitcoin dips again before rallying, possibly pulling XRP’s price lower. XRP’s RSI trendline recently broke, hinting at a big move ahead. The cryptocurrency market has been pretty dull lately, with both Bitcoin and XRP trading sideways. Prices aren’t going up or down in a big way, and traders are waiting for a breakout. However, this calm period is called an accumulation phase, where the price stays in a tight range before making a strong move. Crypto experts now have compared XRP’s current price movement to Bitcoin’s past market cycles. Similar patterns happened with Bitcoin in 2020 and even with the stock market. In both cases, prices hit a high, dropped about 50%, stayed flat for a while, and then broke out to much higher levels. Historically, Bitcoin often dips one more time before starting a new rally. If that happens again, XRP’s price could also drop, depending on how long Bitcoin takes to make its move.

Altcoins to Drop 50–80%, Bitcoin to Face 45% Crash appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is down 3% today, bringing the total market cap to $3 trillion. Bitcoin has dropped to $103,000, down 1.1%. Major altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP are also down by up to 3%, while memecoins such as Dogecoin, Litecoin, and others continue to slide. Top analyst Crypto Capo had recently issued a strong warning saying, “We haven’t seen anything yet.” He warns that altcoins are already dropping hard, even though Bitcoin is still above $100K. Altcoins Could Drop 50–70%, Memecoins To Face 80% Wipeout He identifies two key support levels for Bitcoin: first at $93,000 and then the main support zone between $60K and $ 70 K. This would be a 35-45% decline from the current prices. In a full-blown capitulation or a Black Swan scenario, the analyst says Ethereum could drop 45-55% and reach the $1000-$1200 range. Altcoins are expected to drop 50-70% on average, while memecoins could be hit the hardest. They could crash by up to 60-80%, as per the analyst. He expects the real drop to begin once Bitcoin breaks the $100,000 level. That is when bearish momentum could accelerate sharply. He also shared a few examples of coins that are already collapsing before Bitcoin’s drawdown. Charts Point to Memecoin Meltdown Crypto Capo’s charts show memecoins are on the edge of major breakdowns. FARTCOIN is at risk of dropping 61% to the first support zone around $0.38, and possibly 82% drop to $0.17 if it falls further. RETARDIO is stuck below resistance and showing weakness. Despite several bounces, it’s stuck in a lower range, showing signs of exhaustion. PEPE has triggered a bearish Head and Shoulders pattern, with an expected 70% drop ahead. Slow Bleed Continues CryptoQuant data also shows that altcoins are still deep in a slump. Altcoin Sherpa notes that the top gainers like Fartcoin, SPX, and $HYPE are pulling back the hardest, while the rest of the market is in a slow, steady bleed. He also expects coins like POPCAT to continue drifting lower, with no major liquidations or panic selling so far. Most altcoins look weak, and the analyst sees no strong buy signals at the moment.

2025-06-21T07:50:55,"Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong: Why the World Desperately Needs Crypto Now","BitcoinWorld Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong: Why the World Desperately Needs Crypto Now In a recent and impactful statement, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong took to social media to share a powerful message resonating with many in the digital asset space: the World needs crypto , perhaps now more than at any point in recent history. This isn’t just a bold claim from a figurehead in the industry; it’s a perspective rooted in observing significant global economic trends that he believes cryptocurrency is uniquely positioned to address. Why Does Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong Believe Crypto is Essential? Brian Armstrong’s assertion stems from several critical global economic challenges. He specifically highlighted three major concerns driving his conviction: Exponentially Growing Debt Levels: Across nations, both public and private debt continues to balloon. This unsustainable growth raises questions about future economic stability and the potential for currency devaluation as governments potentially resort to printing more money to service debt. Widespread Inflation: Many countries are grappling with persistent inflation, eroding purchasing power and making it harder for individuals and families to save and maintain their standard of living. Traditional financial systems often struggle to contain this, leaving citizens vulnerable. Erosion of Economic Freedom: Armstrong argues that economic freedom is being chipped away globally. This can manifest in various ways, from capital controls and censorship of transactions to limited access to financial services for large portions of the world’s population. According to the Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong , these intertwined issues create a pressing need for alternative financial systems that are more resilient, accessible, and permissionless than traditional finance. He sees crypto as that necessary alternative. Exploring the Core Crypto Benefits Armstrong Highlights When we talk about why the World needs crypto , we’re really talking about the fundamental advantages that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology offer in the face of the challenges Armstrong outlined. The crypto benefits that stand out include: Decentralization: Unlike traditional currencies controlled by central banks, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin operate on decentralized networks. This removes single points of control and potential failure, offering a degree of independence from government fiscal policies that can lead to inflation or debt crises. Permissionless Access: Anyone with an internet connection can access and use cryptocurrencies. This is a massive step towards global financial inclusion, particularly for the estimated 1.7 billion adults worldwide who remain unbanked but may have mobile phones. This directly combats the erosion of economic freedom by providing financial tools to everyone. Transparency and Security: Transactions on public blockchains are transparent (though parties can be pseudonymous) and secured by cryptographic principles. This contrasts with opaque traditional financial systems and offers a level of security against censorship or arbitrary seizure. Potential Hedge Against Inflation: While volatile, some cryptocurrencies, particularly those with capped supplies like Bitcoin, are viewed by proponents as a potential store of value and a hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies caused by inflation and excessive money printing. Understanding crypto and inflation dynamics is crucial for many seeking alternatives to traditional savings methods. These inherent features form the bedrock of Armstrong’s argument that crypto is not just a speculative asset class, but a vital tool for navigating the current global economic landscape. How Does Crypto Offer Economic Freedom Crypto? The concept of Economic freedom crypto is central to Brian Armstrong’s vision. What does this truly mean in practice? It means giving individuals greater autonomy over their finances. Consider a few scenarios: An individual in a country experiencing hyperinflation can hold value in a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or a stablecoin, preserving their wealth better than holding the rapidly devaluing local currency. A freelancer working for international clients can receive payments quickly and cheaply using crypto, bypassing slow and expensive traditional cross-border transfer systems that often involve multiple intermediaries and fees. People living under authoritarian regimes or in areas with underdeveloped banking infrastructure can access financial services, store value, and transact without needing permission from a bank or government entity. This ability to transact, save, and invest without intermediaries or geographic limitations is the essence of the Economic freedom crypto promises. It empowers individuals and reduces reliance on potentially unstable or restrictive traditional financial systems. Addressing Crypto and Inflation Concerns One of the most discussed aspects of why the World needs crypto , according to Armstrong, is its role in combating inflation. The relationship between Crypto and inflation is complex, but the core idea is that assets with limited supply, like Bitcoin (capped at 21 million coins), are inherently deflationary or disinflationary by design, contrasting sharply with fiat currencies which can be printed indefinitely by central banks. While the crypto market is known for its volatility, many investors see assets like Bitcoin as a form of ‘digital gold’ – a store of value that holds its purchasing power over the long term, especially as traditional currencies lose value due to inflationary pressures. This perspective is gaining traction as global inflation persists. What Does This Mean for the Average Person? Brian Armstrong’s message isn’t just for economists or crypto enthusiasts. It has implications for everyone. As global debt rises and inflation eats away at savings, understanding alternatives becomes increasingly important. The crypto benefits discussed aren’t just theoretical; they offer practical ways for individuals to protect their wealth, participate in the global economy, and gain a degree of financial independence. Whether it’s exploring cryptocurrencies as a small part of a diversified savings strategy or using crypto for faster, cheaper international remittances, the opportunities presented by this technology are becoming harder to ignore in the current economic climate. Conclusion: Crypto’s Growing Role in a Challenging World Brian Armstrong’s statement serves as a potent reminder of the foundational problems that cryptocurrency was created to address. In a world grappling with mounting debt, persistent inflation, and concerns about economic freedom, the case for why the World needs crypto becomes compelling. The unique features of decentralization, permissionless access, and transparency offer tangible crypto benefits that can empower individuals and provide alternatives to traditional financial systems facing significant stress. As the global economic landscape continues to evolve, the role of Economic freedom crypto enables, and the potential of Crypto and inflation hedging will likely become even more significant, validating the perspective shared by the Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong .

2025-06-21T07:49:20,"Solana Price Analysis: Analysts Say SOL ETF Approval Is “Near-Lock” – What Does This Mean for the $200 Target?","Solana (SOL) is back in the spotlight as Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas now estimate a 90% chance of a Solana spot ETF being approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before year-end. According to their June 21 research note, the question is no longer “if,” but “when.” The momentum behind crypto ETFs has surged since Bitcoin and Ethereum funds made their debut on Wall Street. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust alone gathered over $70 billion in assets under management, faster than any ETF in history. NEW: @EricBalchunas & I are raising our odds for the vast majority of the spot crypto ETF filings to 90% or higher. Engagement from the SEC is a very positive sign in our opinion pic.twitter.com/5dh8G8rK6Y — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 20, 2025 With crypto legitimacy rising in D.C., the SEC has shown a willingness to engage with altcoin ETF filings, including updated S-1 forms from Fidelity, Grayscale, Bitwise, and VanEck. Solana is seen as a frontrunner due to its market depth, developer traction, and now, staking-enabled ETF proposals. If approved, these ETFs wouldn’t just track SOL, they’d also stake held tokens, generating additional yield for investors. What a Solana ETF Could Mean for Price Institutional investors gaining direct access to Solana could dramatically shift market dynamics. According to Brian Rudick, Chief Strategy Officer at Solana-focused Upexi, top-tier altcoin ETFs, such as SOL, are likely to see strong inflows post-launch, similar to Bitcoin’s explosive run after its ETF debut. “Spot ETFs were the main reason Bitcoin more than doubled after BlackRock filed in mid-2023,” Rudick said. A comparable demand shock for Solana could ignite a similar rally. If history repeats itself, ETF-driven inflows could propel SOL toward the $200 mark, especially if market sentiment and macroeconomic tailwinds align. Analysts also point to the CFTC’s futures approval for SOL as another positive signal, which reinforces market maturity and regulatory openness toward the asset. Price Faces Technical Hurdles Before Breakout Despite ETF optimism, Solana’s short-term technicals remain bearish. At $140.40, SOL is struggling below the key resistance zone between $144.49 and $145.49, aligned with a descending trendline and the 50-period EMA. SOL is stuck below key resistance at $144.49–$145.49, with a bearish engulfing candle and MACD in the red. If $138.39 support breaks, eyes on $135.74 and $132.57 next. #Solana #Crypto #SOL #TechnicalAnalysis pic.twitter.com/UTWYK9JnOA — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) June 21, 2025 A bearish engulfing candle followed the last failed breakout attempt, sending the token into a consolidation phase just above support at $138.39. The MACD indicator remains in bearish territory, suggesting continued downside risk unless SOL reclaims the $145 zone. Should support at $138.39 give way, price could drop toward $135.74 or even $132.57. Solana Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Key Takeaways: Bloomberg pegs SOL ETF approval odds at 95% ETF issuers include Grayscale, Fidelity, VanEck Staking-enabled ETFs could boost investor yield SOL must break $145.49 to regain bullish momentum Downside levels to watch: $138.39, $135.74, $132.57 Outlook: ETF approval is a long-term catalyst ; however, for short-term Solana price prediction , traders should watch for a confirmed breakout above $145 to signal a bullish continuation. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.2M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers In addition to Solana, with BTC trading near $104K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,249,360 out of its $8,290,897 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.00257 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 58% APY staking pool holding over 1.81 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income. With just hours left and the hard cap nearly reached, momentum is building fast. BTCBULL ’s blend of Bitcoin-linked value, scarcity mechanics, and flexible staking is fueling strong demand. Early buyers have a limited time to enter before the next pricing tier activates.

2025-06-21T07:36:17,"Elon Musk Is Building a DEX on Twitter—What This Means for Crypto","The post Elon Musk Is Building a DEX on Twitter—What This Means for Crypto appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Elon Musk is making his boldest move yet in finance. The visionary billionaire behind Tesla and SpaceX is now transforming X —formerly Twitter—into a decentralized finance powerhouse. If successful, Musk could deliver the Western version of WeChat, combining social media, investing, payments, and crypto all in one app. X to Launch Its Own Decentralized Exchange (DEX) According to a recent post on X by crypto researcher Atlas , the platform is quietly developing into a full-fledged financial ecosystem. Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, confirmed that in-app investing, tipping, and payments are already in the pipeline. These features will be part of X Money , a new digital finance platform currently in limited beta testing, with a broader rollout expected in 2025. One major highlight? Visa is now an official partner of X’s upcoming DEX. Why Musk’s Super App Vision Could Be a Game-Changer Musk’s ultimate goal is to replicate WeChat’s super app model—but in the West. WeChat dominates in China by combining messaging, payments, e-commerce, and even government services into one platform. By integrating a decentralized exchange, Musk gives users: Full control over their funds Censorship resistance Lower transaction fees Enhanced financial privacy Other tech giants are taking note: Meta is exploring in-app payments TikTok is pushing into e-commerce Telegram has already launched P2P crypto trading and tipping But X’s existing scale and Musk’s crypto-friendly stance could give it a major first-mover advantage. Could X Disrupt Coinbase, Robinhood, and Revolut? Atlas warns that this move could shake up the entire fintech and crypto exchange landscape. With in-app trading of stablecoins , BTC, ETH, and tokenized assets, X could replace the need for separate apps like Coinbase, Robinhood, and Revolut. While centralized exchanges like Binance, Bybit, Coinbase, OKX, and Upbit still handle more than 85% of crypto spot volume, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are rapidly growing. Top DEXs by volume today include: PancakeSwap (v2 & v3) Uniswap v2 Raydium Curve Finance The Future of Finance Will Be Cultural, Not Technical Atlas emphasizes that mass adoption won’t come from whitepapers or technical jargon—it will come from entertainment, virality, and seamless finance integration. With X already a cultural hub, Musk may be the one to trigger the next wave of crypto adoption —not with a whitepaper, but with a viral tweet. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-21T07:27:05,"Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP Prices are Down Today?","The post Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP Prices are Down Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market today is feeling the weight of macroeconomic and geopolitical risks. Successively, the valuation of the industry has dropped to $3.2 trillion, with a 1.10% decline in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the 24-hour trading volume has surged over 42% to hit $114.74 billion, signaling heightened volatility and possibly panic-led sell-offs. Amidst the ruckus, the Fear & Greed Index has moved to 43, placing the market in the neutral zone. Rising tensions in the Middle East and uncertainties around the potential restoration of Trump-era trade policies are spooking both traditional and digital asset investors. Let’s take a closer look at how this is impacting Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction: Can It Hold Above $102k? Bitcoin price today is at $103,491, down 0.94% in the past 24 hours. The daily low sits at $102,372, suggesting that the price is hovering dangerously close to key support levels. The 38% uptick in 24-hour volume to $50.25B indicates aggressive intraday trading, but not necessarily bullish accumulation. If BTC fails to maintain support at $102,000, a further slide toward $100,000 or even $98,500 is highly likely. However, if the market finds temporary relief and BTC reclaims $105,000, a short-term recovery toward $107,000–$108,000 may be on the cards. Curious about BTC’s year-end target? Read our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction: $2,400 or $2,300 First? Ethereum is bearing the brunt of today’s drop, plunging 3.59% to $2,423.62. The altcoin has seen its daily trading volume crash by over 76%, now at $21.59 billion. With a daily low of $2,371, ETH is testing a crucial demand zone. If it breaks below $2,370, the next key support lies around $2,300, followed by $2,200. It is worth noting that to initiate a recovery, ETH must climb back above $2,500. That being said, a push beyond $2,570 could invalidate short-term bearish setups and open a route toward $2,650. Hodling ETH? Check out our Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 Now! XRP Price Prediction: Is a Drop Below $2 Next? XRP price has slipped 1.16% over the past 24 hours to trade at $2.12, with a low of $2.09. Despite the modest drop compared to ETH, the volume has surged 45.9% to $2.49 billion, which I believe, that larger holders are offloading positions. If bearish pressure intensifies, XRP may retest $2.00, a support that could give way to a drop toward $1.90. Contrarily, reclaiming $2.18 could spark a minor relief rally toward $2.30. Curious about XRP’s future returns? Read our Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 Now! FAQs Why is the Bitcoin price falling today? Bitcoin is reacting to macroeconomic uncertainty, including tensions in the Middle East and fears surrounding potential Trump-era policy rollbacks. Will Ethereum fall below $2,300? Given the sharp volume decline and price weakness, Ethereum could test the $2,300–$2,200 range if the bulls don’t step in soon. Is XRP expected to drop below $2? If current bearish momentum continues, XRP could slide below $2, targeting $1.90 as the next major support.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-ethereum-xrp-prices-going-low-today/,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare

It has emerged that the company is considering using the eye-scan-based World ID system developed by Tools for Humanity, co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. This is also a system that is linked to the World (WLD) altcoin. The ongoing talks between Reddit and Tools for Humanity could pave the way for users on the platform to both remain anonymous and prove they are human, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The talks have gained momentum amid the rise of fake content generated by artificial intelligence online and the emergence of age-verification laws for social media in several countries. Related News: Two Companies Announce Bitcoin Purchase Strategy - Here's How Much They Plan to Buy Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said last month that due to AI-based threats and age verification regulations, the company will have to determine whether users are human and of a certain age. Huffman said that they will work with third-party providers to avoid collecting user data: “We will work to preserve both the humanity and anonymity of Reddit.” The World ID is created with unique biometric data obtained from a user’s iris. This data is fragmented and stored on secret servers in different parts of the world. The system allows users to prove that they are a unique individual without revealing their identity. The identity verification process is completed with a World ID stored encrypted on the user’s phone. As a reward, users are given WLD tokens. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-21T07:04:27,"16,000,000,000 Passwords Leaked in Historic Data Breach – Apple, Facebook and Google Users Affected: Report","Cybersecurity researchers have reportedly uncovered what is likely the biggest data breach in history, affecting billions of people who use Apple, Facebook, Google and other services. Since the beginning of the year, researchers at Cybernews have been thumbing through “supermassive datasets” that contain at least 16 billion records of login information for social media, VPNs, developer portals, corporate platforms and much more. The researchers say “no stone was left unturned.” “This is not just a leak – it’s a blueprint for mass exploitation. With over 16 billion login records exposed, cybercriminals now have unprecedented access to personal credentials that can be used for account takeover, identity theft, and highly targeted phishing. What’s especially concerning is the structure and recency of these datasets – these aren’t just old breaches being recycled. This is fresh, weaponizable intelligence at scale.” The experts say that some of the datasets were labeled with vague names like “logins” or “credentials,” not giving much of a hint as to what was inside the files. However, other datasets were more specific with their labeling. According to the researchers, one dataset’s name suggested it was linked to the Russian Federation and had over 455 million records inside. Another was named after Telegram, the encrypted messaging app. “The inclusion of both old and recent infostealer logs – often with tokens, cookies, and metadata – makes this data particularly dangerous for organizations lacking multi-factor authentication or credential hygiene practices,” Bob Diachenko, a cybersecurity researcher and a contributor to Cybernews, is responsible for the discovery. Diachenko clarified that there was “no centralized data breach” of the aforementioned tech companies. Rather, the information was likely extracted using infostealers and then leaked onto the dark web. Researcher Aras Nazarovas said that the discovery might be evidence that cybercriminals have abandoned their old techniques of stealing data, and moving onto more sophisticated methods. “The increased number of exposed infostealer datasets in the form of centralized, traditional databases, like the ones found by the Cybernews research team, may be a sign, that cybercriminals are actively shifting from previously popular alternatives such as Telegram groups, which were previously the go-to place for obtaining data collected by infostealer malware.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-21T06:40:24,"Governor Abbott signed House Bill 4488 to protect Bitcoin reserves.","Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed House Bill 4488, ensuring that state funds — including any Bitcoin Reserve held outside the state treasury — are shielded from being redirected into general revenue. This paves the way for Texas to formalize a strategic Bitcoin investment program . Still , Governor Abbott has yet to weigh in on SB21, a bill permitting state investment in cryptocurrencies with at least a market capitalization of $500 billion. So far, only Bitcoin meets the criteria. Texas Governor Abbott has yet to approve or reject the SB21 bill The House Bill 4488 protects the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, the Texas Advanced Nuclear Development Fund, and the Gulf Coast Protection Account. That means the funds will remain established or maintained as distinct entities within or outside the state treasury, as defined by their enabling laws. However, creating the state’s Bitcoin Reserve hinges on signing SB21 or a comparable bill. If the legislation is signed, then the fund would fall under the legal protections outlined in HB4488. SB21 was submitted to the governor on June 1, giving him until June 22 to sign or veto it. If he takes no action by then, the bill will automatically become law. New Hampshire and Arizona approved their Bitcoin Reserve bills New Hampshire , Arizona, and Texas are among the first states to approve state-level Bitcoin Reserves. Although several other states introduced similar bills in recent months, most failed to advance due to lawmakers’ reluctance over concerns of Bitcoin’s volatility and long-term viability as a reserve asset. Arizona’s Senate also recently passed HB 2324 in a 16-14 vote, a bill that could see the expansion of the state’s crypto infrastructure. The bill is now back in the House for a final decision. If passed, the bill would amend Arizona’s forfeiture laws to permit the state to treat abandoned digital assets as unclaimed property. Arizona’s House also passed Senate Bill 1025 (SB1025), which stipulated that seized funds could be invested in Bitcoin. However, Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed it. She wrote: The Arizona State Retirement System is one of the strongest in the nation because it makes sound and informed investments. Arizonans’ retirement funds are not the place for the state to try untested investments like virtual currencу. Governor Katie Hobbs Michigan also introduced four new pro-crypto bills. The first would permit the state’s retirement fund to hold Bitcoin, while the second bill targets CBDCs, calling for a statewide ban and enhanced financial privacy protections. The other two bills are centered on BTC mining, including benefits for those operating on abandoned oil and gas wells. New Hampshire passed HB 302 into law, allowing the state treasurer to purchase Bitcoin and other digital assets with a market cap above $500 billion. The state also maintains a 5% cap on Bitcoin and digital assets to ensure crypto remains complementary. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-06-21T06:30:34,"Consolidation Takes Its Toll: Bitcoin Investors No Longer Greedy","Data shows the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has returned back to the neutral territory, a sign that investors are losing optimism. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Has Reset Back To Neutral The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment present among the traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: Dogecoin Gears Up For 60% Move—Will It Be Up Or Down? The index makes use of the data of these five factors in order to determine the trader mentality: trading volume, market cap dominance, volatility, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. The indicator represents the calculated sentiment as a score lying between zero and hundred. Values above the 54 mark correspond to the dominance of greed in the market, while those below 46 to presence of fear among the investors. All values lying between these cutoffs correlate to a net neutral sentiment. Now, here is how the mood in the Bitcoin market is like right now according to the Fear & Greed Index: As is visible above, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has a value of 54 at the moment, which suggests the investors hold a neutral sentiment, although one that’s right on the edge of turning into greed. The recent neutral mentality in the sector has come following a phase of greed among the traders, as the below chart shows. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index spiked to a high of 72 earlier in the month as the asset’s price gave investors hope that its consolidation phase might be coming to an end. As the recovery rally has fizzled out and the coin has returned to its range, however, optimism among the investors has predictably faded. If history is to go by, though, this development may not actually be so bad for the cryptocurrency. Generally, digital asset markets tend to move in a way that goes contrary to the expectations of the majority. The probability of such an opposite move taking place goes up the more extreme the crowd opinion becomes. Besides the three core sentiments, there are two special regions known as the extreme fear (under 25) and extreme greed (above 75). These zones are where the likelihood of a contrary move has been the strongest in the past, with tops and bottoms often taking form. Although the market sentiment has recently only seen a reset to the neutral territory, the fact that the investors are no longer greedy could still be a positive for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. There have been many instances in the past where a dip into the neutral zone was enough for the bull run to regain momentum.

2025-06-21T06:30:15,"Solana and BTC Investors Are Placing Big Bets on MAGACOIN FINANCE","As June 2025 unfolds, investors from the Solana (SOL) and Bitcoin (BTC) communities are making bold moves by placing significant bets on MAGACOIN FINANCE. While XRP, Ethereum (ETH), TRON (TRX), and Sei (SEI) remain in the spotlight for their own developments, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as the top speculative play, drawing attention for its explosive upside potential and strategic positioning in the current market cycle. Powerhouse Performance: MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Early Investment Surge MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly establishing itself as a leading force in the altcoin pre-sale space, gaining momentum through exclusivity and growing investor enthusiasm. Its transparent token distribution, capped supply, and upcoming staking functionality are central to its long-term appeal. Backed by strong analyst sentiment, the project is positioned for compelling performance following its public launch. Project Highlights: Transparent and capped tokenomics Strategic bonuses supporting both community and institutional engagement, including a 100% bonus for larger contributors using PATRIOTS100X . Solana (SOL): Bullish Outlook and Institutional Interest Solana is trading near $149, with bullish analysts forecasting a surge to $380–$500 by year-end, driven by institutional adoption and DeFi/NFT growth. Despite past network outages, high transaction speeds and low fees keep SOL at the forefront. As Solana’s ecosystem expands, some investors are rotating profits into MAGACOIN FINANCE, seeking sharper early-stage returns. Bitcoin (BTC): Market Anchor and Sentiment Driver Bitcoin remains structurally sound, though recent price hesitancy and macroeconomic concerns have led to cautious sentiment. Still, BTC’s leadership continues to set the tone for the broader market. As BTC consolidates, many traders are diversifying into high-upside plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE. XRP: Awaiting Major Catalysts XRP is trading near $2.20–$2.31, with investors closely watching the June 16 Ripple lawsuit decision and ETF speculation. While whale accumulation signals long-term confidence, many are also hedging with MAGACOIN FINANCE for higher-multiple potential as regulatory clarity remains elusive. Ethereum (ETH): Bullish Momentum Builds ETH is trading around $2,690, up 8% daily, as the Pectra upgrade and institutional inflows fuel optimism. With resistance near $2,700–$2,900, some ETH holders are diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture early-stage momentum before the next leg up. TRON (TRX): Bullish Trend and Price Targets TRON is holding above $0.28, with June forecasts targeting $0.31 and a bullish outlook for 2025. As TRX maintains its uptrend, some traders are allocating to MAGACOIN FINANCE for its high-upside potential. Sei (SEI): Growth Forecasts for 2025 SEI is expected to show solid growth, with forecasts suggesting a rise to around €0.77 ($0.83) by December 2025. As SEI’s ecosystem expands, MAGACOIN FINANCE is also benefiting from renewed interest in innovative altcoins. Final Thoughts With Solana and Bitcoin investors leading the charge, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the breakout story of June 2025. As XRP, ETH, TRX, and SEI hold steady, the boldest upside may belong to those moving early on MAGACOIN FINANCE.

2025-06-21T06:00:14,"Why Bitcoin Whales Are Quietly Buying Into MAGACOIN FINANCE","While the broader crypto market digests June’s volatility, a new trend is emerging beneath the surface. Large Bitcoin holders — often known for their early positioning — are quietly rotating capital into MAGACOIN FINANCE. At the same time, more visible assets like Chainlink, Polkadot, Polygon, and Cardano are grappling with resistance levels and investor hesitation. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Quiet Moves, Clear Intent As legacy tokens fight to maintain momentum, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining traction where it matters — among smart money. Bitcoin whales are steadily buying in, not for flash, but for fundamentals. With a hard supply cap of 170 billion tokens, staking already operational, and a fully audited smart contract via HashEx, this project offers a rare alignment of security, utility, and upside potential.This is the type of asset Bitcoin whales accumulate early — before it makes headlines. Why top investors are entering now: Capped Supply: No risk of inflation or stealth minting Staking Rewards: Passive income model already running Verified Code: Full audit completed for trust assurance Decentralized Control: No VC manipulation, all community-led On-Chain Patterns: Low churn, growing wallet concentration Bonus Active: PATRIOTS100X giving early entrants added leverage Chainlink (LINK) Eyes Continuation Above $16 Chainlink recently bounced back, surging to $15.30 and currently trading near $15.80–$16.50. The move came after strong integration news involving SWIFT and JPMorgan, pushing bullish forecasts toward $20–$25 if momentum sustains. Still, with LINK approaching key resistance, some short-term traders are locking in gains and reallocating to smaller-cap assets with higher near-term upside. Polkadot (DOT) Rises on Elastic Scaling Buzz Polkadot is testing the $4.40–$4.80 range following a 16% weekly gain, driven by anticipation around its June 2025 Elastic Scaling rollout. If DOT breaks above $5.00, analysts believe it could reach $8–$10 by year-end. For now, the token is showing strength but hasn’t fully confirmed a longer-term breakout, leading cautious capital to diversify elsewhere. Polygon (MATIC) Rebounds During PoS Transition Polygon is currently trading between $0.21 and $0.28 amid major structural changes, including the transition from MATIC to POL. With Polygon 2.0 and AggLayer v3.0 aiming for massive TPS boosts and better cross-chain liquidity, long-term interest remains strong. However, the short-term price has yet to reflect those changes, keeping speculative capital on standby. Cardano (ADA) Drifts Amid Governance Uncertainty Cardano is hovering around $0.63 following a 26% year-to-date decline. The treasury debate over reallocating 140 million ADA has caused unease within the community. While the Chang hard fork and Hydra upgrade offer long-term promise, ADA’s price action is subdued, and many traders are looking toward more active growth opportunities. Final Thoughts With Chainlink, Polkadot, Polygon, and Cardano navigating technical hurdles, the quiet accumulation of MAGACOIN FINANCE by large holders may signal where the next breakout truly begins.

Without this law, these funds might have been forced to be sold off in 2025. Now, they’re safe and won’t be treated like regular government money. This shows that Texas is serious about using and protecting cryptocurrency as part of its official financial plans. Update: Texas has passed a law securing off-treasury $BTC reserves, with a key decision on SB21 potentially allowing the state to buy #Bitcoin , set for June 22. #CoinPedia #CryptoNews #Blockchain #CryptoMarket pic.twitter.com/jS0eJluyH9 — Coinpedia (@CoinpediaNews) June 21, 2025 Bitcoin Investment Bill Awaits Abbott’s Decision While HB 4488 is now law, all eyes are on Senate Bill 21 (SB21) , which proposes allowing Texas to invest directly in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with market caps over $500 billion. At present, only Bitcoin qualifies, making it the prime candidate for state investment. Governor Abbott has until June 22 to sign or veto SB21. If he takes no action, the bill will become law automatically. SB21 would mark a major milestone in crypto adoption at the state level, aligning Texas with a growing number of institutions that view Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Institutional Momentum Builds Around Bitcoin Governor Abbott’s steps mirror a broader institutional trend. Hedge fund manager Eric Semler, who chairs healthcare firm Semler Scientific, has been vocal in his support of Bitcoin as a long-term investment . Semler’s firm recently increased its Bitcoin holdings, reinforcing the view that crypto is gaining ground as a store of value. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Crypto Market Is Down Today? $240B Wiped Out Amid Israel-Iran Tensions , His popular approach, investing in what most don’t, has paid off historically, especially in turbulent markets. Semler’s confidence in Bitcoin also echoes the sentiment of a growing number of hedge funds; recent data shows nearly half now have some crypto exposure. Texas is Sending a Message The passage of HB 4488 shows that Texas is serious about protecting its crypto reserves. If SB21 follows, the state could become one of the first to officially invest in Bitcoin. Together, these two bills reflect a calculated but forward-looking approach. For investors and institutions watching from the sidelines, Texas might be the place where crypto meets government policy and gets taken seriously. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

SB21 is highly likely to become law as Governor Abbott’s deadline is June 22, 2025, and inaction means automatic passage. It would enable Texas to directly invest in Bitcoin, creating a state-managed reserve. What are the potential risks of Texas holding Bitcoin as a strategic reserve outside traditional assets? Potential risks include Bitcoin’s high volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and cybersecurity threats. Critics also question whether government involvement in speculative assets aligns with prudent fiscal policy. Why is only Bitcoin currently qualifying for Texas’s proposed investment bill and could Ethereum join later? Only Bitcoin currently qualifies because SB21 requires a minimum 12-month average market capitalization of $500 billion. Ethereum could join later if its market cap consistently meets this threshold. What impact might Texas’s crypto policies have on institutional interest in Bitcoin? Texas’s proactive crypto policies could significantly boost institutional interest in Bitcoin by legitimizing it as a reserve asset, potentially encouraging other states and large entities to follow suit.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/texas-protects-its-bitcoin-holdings-with-new-law/,"ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Reserve",cryptocompare
2025-06-21T05:30:55,"Bitcoin ‘Rainbow Chart’ Signals Buying Opportunity, But Weak Demand Raises Concerns","According to a recent post on X by crypto analyst Crypto Rover, the Bitcoin (BTC) Rainbow Chart is flashing a buy signal, suggesting that the leading cryptocurrency may be on the cusp of a significant upward move. However, weak market demand could pose a risk to this bullish momentum. Bitcoin Rainbow Chart Flashes Buy Signal After hitting a new all-time high (ATH) on May 22, BTC has spent nearly a month consolidating between the $100,000 and $110,000 range, without showing a clear directional bias. Now, one of the most well-known indicators – the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart – is pointing toward potential upside for the top digital asset. Crypto Rover shared the following chart, showing BTC currently trading in the light green, or “buy”, zone of the Rainbow pattern. Historically, Bitcoin has often entered this zone shortly after each four-year halving, signalling potential growth ahead. For the uninitiated, the Bitcoin Rainbow Chart is a long-term valuation tool that uses a logarithmic growth curve with color bands to show where Bitcoin’s price stands relative to historical trends. Each color band suggests a different market sentiment, helping investors identify potential overvaluation or undervaluation zones. While the Rainbow Chart’s buy signal is promising, the broader demand for BTC appears lackluster. In a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post, contributor Darkfost pointed out that sluggish demand is limiting Bitcoin’s ability to break out. Darkfost shared the following chart, which compares new BTC supply to coins held inactive for over a year – used to gauge apparent demand. When the ratio moves above zero, it typically indicates strong market demand. Since the last local top in May, this apparent demand metric has been gradually declining, though it remains sufficient to absorb current selling pressure. In essence, while BTC is managing to stay above the $100,000 level, demand is fading – a potential headwind. However, some encouraging signs remain. In a separate X post, crypto trader Merlijn The Trader noted that the buy/sell pressure delta is showing an oversold signal, implying that short-term sellers could be nearing exhaustion . BTC Wyckoff Accumulation Nearing End? Crypto market commentator Ted Pillows added that BTC may be in the final stage of the Wyckoff Accumulation pattern. According to Ted, a decisive breakout above $110,000 could send Bitcoin surging to $130,000 “in no time.” Overall, Bitcoin continues to demonstrate a healthy technical structure, maintaining support at the $104,000 level. The market also saw notable deleveraging following yesterday’s US Federal Reserve meeting. That said, Bitcoin exchange activity is starting to show signs of fatigue, while retail investors continue to stay on the sidelines. At press time, BTC trades at $104,128, up 0.2% in the past 24 hours.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-rainbow-chart-signals-buying-opportunity-but-weak-demand-raises-concerns/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Apparent Demand|btc|BTCUSDT|buy/sell pressure delta|crypto|Cryptocurrency|digital asset|Rainbow Chart|wykcoff accumulation",cryptocompare
2025-06-21T05:01:45,"Why Crypto Market Is Down Today? $240B Wiped Out Amid Israel-Iran Tensions","The post Why Crypto Market Is Down Today? $240B Wiped Out Amid Israel-Iran Tensions appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market has been under immense pressure over the past week, primarily due to growing geopolitical risks. On June 21, the total cryptocurrency market dropped by 1.26% to $3.21 trillion, wiping out nearly $240 billion in value. Bitcoin led the fall, slipping to a low of $103,127, down 2% in just seven days. Altcoins were hit even harder—Ethereum dropped to $2,456, losing 10% during the same time. But what exactly is causing this crypto market crash? Let’s break down! Israel-Iran War & U.S. Involvement Fears The biggest trigger has been the rising conflict between Israel and Iran. Crypto investors are now worried that the U.S. might step into the war, as Trump has already warned Iran over not signing a deal. As a result, Bitcoin fell from $108,000 to $103,000 in a week, while Ethereum, Solana & Dogecoin also dropped over 10%. Whale Sell-Offs Taking Profits Whales are starting to sell huge amounts of Bitcoin and moving off altcoin on the exchange. According to Glassnode data , wallets that held BTC for 6–12 months sold over $900 million recently. Even those who’ve held Bitcoin for over a year have started cashing out. In early June, long-term holders took home $1.2 billion in profits, one of the biggest profit-taking waves this year. Massive Liquidations Add Pressure As prices dropped, many traders using leverage got wiped out. In the past 24 hours alone, over $503 million in crypto positions were liquidated, with 134,000 traders affected. Most of these losses happened on Ethereum, which saw $183 million in liquidations. The largest single loss was seen by a Bitcoin trade worth $8 million on the Bybit exchange. Altcoins Hit Harder Than Bitcoin While Bitcoin dropped about 2%, most altcoins dropped even more. Ethereum is down 10% for the week, Solana fell over 11%, and XRP lost 1.4%. The Altcoin Index has dropped to 22, showing Bitcoin is dominating the market. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Specifically, Ethereum saw $183 million in liquidations, and XRP lost 1.4%. Bitcoin had a single $8 million liquidation. Is this crypto dip a buying opportunity or a signal to get out? This dip presents a complex situation. While historical patterns suggest Bitcoin often rebounds after geopolitical events, ongoing whale sell-offs and liquidations add risk, making careful research and risk assessment crucial for any investment decision. Will the market rebound quickly, or is this the start of a deeper correction? The market’s immediate future is uncertain. While some historical trends suggest a potential rebound after geopolitical shocks, the extent of whale selling and mass liquidations indicates that a deeper correction is possible if these pressures persist.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-crypto-market-is-down-today-240b-wiped-out-amid-israel-iran-tensions/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-21T05:00:58,"Bitcoin Sees Modest Gains, But Demand Weakness Limits Breakout Potential","Bitcoin has resumed a slow climb upward after a recent period of consolidation, briefly breaking back above the $106,000 mark earlier today. At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $105,383, reflecting a 0.8% increase over the past 24 hours. While this upward move has not sparked a major breakout, analysts are paying close attention to on-chain and market structure indicators that suggest a cautiously balanced environment. Related Reading: Analyst Warns Of Bitcoin Breakdown—’If This Continues, It Snaps’ On-Chain Data Points to Equilibrium, But Demand Wanes According to CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost, the market currently lacks extreme signals of profit-taking or panic. In a recent analysis, Darkfost explained that realized profits over a seven-day moving average remain below $1 billion. This is in line with figures observed during the market correction in late 2024 and significantly below peaks seen in early 2025. The analyst suggests that the current realized profit levels point to a market that is not under pressure from large-scale investor exits, supporting the ongoing consolidation. In the same report, Darkfost also discussed how a decline in demand may be limiting further upward momentum. By analyzing the ratio of new supply to the supply held inactive for over a year, the study observed that while demand remains positive, it has been weakening since Bitcoin’s local high in May. This suggests that although the market is absorbing existing selling pressure, fresh buying interest is not strong enough to trigger a new rally. As a result, the market appears to be in a state of temporary equilibrium, a phase where both sellers and buyers are relatively inactive. Bitcoin Traders Brace for Volatility in a Crowded Range Another CryptoQuant analyst, BorisVest, echoed the sentiment of a tightly contested market by analyzing Binance order flow and position data. He noted that Bitcoin has traded within a range of $100,000 to $110,000 for nearly a month. Within this band, both long and short positions have been building, and traders are watching the extremes of this zone closely. According to BorisVest, any breakout beyond $110,000 or drop below $100,000 could set the tone for the next significant price movement. The $100K–$110K price range has become a battleground for both bulls and bears. BorisVest observed that short positions are currently increasing, indicating that a significant portion of market participants expect a downward correction.

On-Chain Signals Say ‘Watch This Level’ However, he also pointed out that when shorts dominate, the risk of a sudden reversal, known as a short squeeze, becomes more likely. This behavior is consistent with recent funding rate trends, which show a fairly balanced distribution of long and short bets.

2025-06-21T03:58:54,"Semler Scientific Unveils Plan to Accumulate 105,000 BTC by 2027","Nasdaq-listed healthcare technology company, Semler Scientific, has outlined a bold multi-year plan to significantly expand its Bitcoin holdings. The company aims to hold 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025 as an initial milestone. Building on this, it plans to increase its holdings to 42,000 BTC by the end of 2026. By the close of 2027, Semler intends to reach a total of 105,000 BTC. Semler Reports 287% Bitcoin Yield to Date According to the official press release, the company said it will fund these purchases using a mix of equity and debt financing, as well as operational cash flows. Semler, which in May 2024 became the second US public company to adopt Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset, has since emerged as a significant corporate Bitcoin holder. As of June 3, 2025, the firm reported a 287% yield on its Bitcoin investment and a $177 million unrealized gain. In a move to strengthen its new approach, Semler has appointed Joe Burnett as Director of Bitcoin Strategy. Burnett, formerly Director of Market Research at Unchained, brings more than seven years of experience in Bitcoin advocacy and research. In a statement, Eric Semler, chairman of Semler Scientific, said, “We are excited to have Joe join our Bitcoin strategy team and help drive our three-year-plan to own 105,000 Bitcoins. Joe is an analytical thought leader on Bitcoin and Bitcoin treasury companies. His expertise will be instrumental as we pursue our Bitcoin treasury strategy and aim to deliver long-term value to our stockholders.” Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Grow An increasing number of public companies are deepening their involvement with the largest cryptocurrency. For instance, Genius Group, an AI-driven education company, recently increased its corporate Bitcoin reserves from 66 BTC to 100 BTC, after acquiring an additional 34 BTC valued at approximately $3.42 million. The company resumed its Bitcoin purchases on May 22, following a May 6 US Court of Appeals ruling that lifted previous legal restrictions stemming from a dispute related to its merger with FatBrain AI. CEO Roger Hamilton described reaching 100 BTC as a milestone in their broader plan to accumulate 1,000 BTC. Earlier this month, New York-based Mercurity Fintech Holding announced it would raise $800 million to build a Bitcoin treasury reserve. The company plans to integrate staking and tokenized finance tools, using secure blockchain custody infrastructure to reshape its treasury operations and boost capital efficiency through yield generation.

2025-06-21T03:30:19,"Bitcoin May Surprise Bears: $100K–$110K Range Shows Rising Short Interest","While Bitcoin (BTC) has remained range-bound – trading between $100,000 and $110,000 for about a month – both short and long positions have been building within this range, with short positions rising at a faster pace. Bitcoin Long Positions Slightly Ahead But Shorts Catching Up After reaching a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,814 last month, BTC has consolidated within the $100,000–$110,000 range for nearly a month, offering little clarity on its next directional move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holds Strong Despite Israel-Iran Tensions – Weekly Resistance Begins To Crack According to a new CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor BorisVest, fresh data from Binance crypto exchange suggests that long positions currently hold a slight edge in this range. Historical data reveals a pattern – when short positions rise, short squeezes tend to follow. Similarly, a buildup in long positions has often led to long squeezes. A decisive breakout from either end of the current range will likely determine Bitcoin’s next major move. That said, Binance data indicates that while long positions are marginally ahead, the ratio of longs to shorts remains relatively balanced. The funding rate hovering near neutral levels supports this view, reflecting a closely contested standoff between bulls and bears. However, such balance usually signals uncertainty in the market. While long interest has stabilized, short positions continue to climb – likely driven by expectations of further downside amid escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. BorisVest noted: This shows that most market participants believe the rally may not continue. When Bitcoin’s price starts to fall, and funding rates turn negative, it means shorts are piling in quickly. All of this points to this range being a highly sensitive zone. He further noted that with most traders leaning toward short positions, the setup could be ripe for a surprise move in the opposite direction – possibly fuelled by quiet accumulation from larger market participants. Is BTC Preparing For A Big Move? Despite BTC trading within the $100,000 – $110,000 range for the better part of the previous month, several analysts posit that the flagship cryptocurrency is preparing for a major move in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidates as Realized Profits Stay Low – No Signs Of Major Sell-Off Yet Most analysts are leaning toward a move to the upside. For instance, crypto trader Josh Olszewics remarked that if liquidity holds, then BTC may eye a move toward the $150,000 level. From a technical standpoint, the outlook is encouraging. Crypto analyst Mister Crypto recently pointed out that BTC is forming a bullish inverse head & shoulders pattern on the 3-day chart. However, latest on-chain data shows that Bitcoin Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Golden Cross recently moved into an overpriced zone, warranting caution. At press time, BTC trades at $105,940, up 1.1% in the past 24 hours.

With the altcoin market heating up and investors seeking the next big winner, tokens like Polkadot (DOT), Kaspa (KAS), and Aptos (APT) remain in focus—but it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that’s capturing the most attention for its early-stage momentum and breakout potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Frontrunner in 2025’s Crypto Presale Landscape MAGACOIN FINANCE has swiftly established itself as a frontrunner in the 2025 crypto presale landscape, raising over $10 million in a matter of weeks. The project’s official website offers limited access, with a bonus of 100% on investments using PATRIOTS100X. Its innovative staking platform and capped supply are appealing to both retail and institutional investors. Its contracts have been verified by HashEx, one of the most trusted names in smart contract auditing. The unique blend of meme appeal and utility is expected to drive continued growth. Solana (SOL): Bullish Structure and Institutional Support Solana is trading between $150 and $195, with analysts eyeing a breakout above $165 as a trigger for further gains. Institutional interest and ecosystem expansion continue to fuel optimism, and as SOL consolidates, many traders are allocating profits into MAGACOIN FINANCE for higher-upside exposure. Polkadot (DOT): Consistent Growth, Steady Outlook Polkadot is forecasted to trade between $3.67 and $3.68 in June, with longer-term projections pointing to steady but moderate gains. As DOT’s growth moderates, investors seeking sharper returns are increasingly looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE. Kaspa (KAS): Range-Bound but on Watchlists Kaspa is trading near $0.08, with technicals suggesting a range-bound summer. While KAS offers stability, it lacks the explosive upside now drawing capital to MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale. Aptos (APT): Bullish Forecasts and Ecosystem Growth Aptos is projected to trade between $4.44 and $4.48 in June, with bullish sentiment for 2025 as the ecosystem expands. As APT builds, some holders are diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture early-stage gains. Final Thoughts With XRP, Solana, and Bitcoin followers all zoning in, MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting the pace for June 2025’s altcoin market. As DOT, KAS, and APT hold steady, the boldest opportunities may belong to those who move early on MAGACOIN FINANCE.
