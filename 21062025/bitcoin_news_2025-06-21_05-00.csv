2025-06-21T02:30:19,"XRP, SOL, and BTC Followers Are Zoning In on MAGACOIN FINANCE’s Moves","As June 2025 unfolds, followers of XRP, Solana (SOL), and Bitcoin (BTC) are increasingly zoning in on the explosive moves of MAGACOIN FINANCE. With the altcoin market heating up and investors seeking the next big winner, tokens like Polkadot (DOT), Kaspa (KAS), and Aptos (APT) remain in focus—but it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that’s capturing the most attention for its early-stage momentum and breakout potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Frontrunner in 2025’s Crypto Presale Landscape MAGACOIN FINANCE has swiftly established itself as a frontrunner in the 2025 crypto presale landscape, raising over $10 million in a matter of weeks. The project’s official website offers limited access, with a bonus of 100% on investments using PATRIOTS100X. Its innovative staking platform and capped supply are appealing to both retail and institutional investors. Its contracts have been verified by HashEx, one of the most trusted names in smart contract auditing. The unique blend of meme appeal and utility is expected to drive continued growth. Solana (SOL): Bullish Structure and Institutional Support Solana is trading between $150 and $195, with analysts eyeing a breakout above $165 as a trigger for further gains. Institutional interest and ecosystem expansion continue to fuel optimism, and as SOL consolidates, many traders are allocating profits into MAGACOIN FINANCE for higher-upside exposure. Polkadot (DOT): Consistent Growth, Steady Outlook Polkadot is forecasted to trade between $3.67 and $3.68 in June, with longer-term projections pointing to steady but moderate gains. As DOT’s growth moderates, investors seeking sharper returns are increasingly looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE. Kaspa (KAS): Range-Bound but on Watchlists Kaspa is trading near $0.08, with technicals suggesting a range-bound summer. While KAS offers stability, it lacks the explosive upside now drawing capital to MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale. Aptos (APT): Bullish Forecasts and Ecosystem Growth Aptos is projected to trade between $4.44 and $4.48 in June, with bullish sentiment for 2025 as the ecosystem expands. As APT builds, some holders are diversifying into MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture early-stage gains. Final Thoughts With XRP, Solana, and Bitcoin followers all zoning in, MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting the pace for June 2025’s altcoin market. As DOT, KAS, and APT hold steady, the boldest opportunities may belong to those who move early on MAGACOIN FINANCE.

2025-06-21T02:00:22,"Dogecoin Breaks Free—Could Soar 60%, Analyst Says","Dogecoin edged up slightly to $0.17 on Friday, gaining 1.0% in the last 24 hours. Trading has thinned out this week, and Dogecoin has slipped almost 3% over the past seven days. Based on reports, investors are moving carefully as volume dropped 30% to about $678 million. Related Reading: Iran’s Top Crypto Hub Loses $82 Million To Hackers With Israeli Links—Details Trading Volume Drop Signals Caution According to on‑chain data, the slump in daily volume shows fewer traders are stepping in. That 34% slide in activity suggests a loss of momentum. Some market watchers say low volume often leads to whipsaws. When fewer coins change hands, even modest buys or sells can push prices sharply in either direction. #Dogecoin $DOGE looks prime for a 60% price move! All you need to do is wait for a daily close outside of the $0.16 to $0.22 range to determine the direction of the trend. So go to @coinexcom, sign up using my referral link https://t.co/73n8mWavUX, and join me in this trade! pic.twitter.com/Im27DBuBka — Ali (@ali_charts) June 19, 2025 Triangle Pattern Points To Imminent Breakout On charts stretching from early 2024 into mid‑2025, Dogecoin fits a symmetrical triangle. Prices have carved lower highs and higher lows as trendlines converge. Data from crypto analyst Ali shows, this narrowing range often precedes a major move. He notes the tip of the triangle is due by June 2025, which puts a deadline on when volatility should pick up. DOGE Bulls Eye Breakout According to Ali’s analysis, a daily close above $0.22 likely signals a bullish breakout. If that happens, he sees Dogecoin reaching roughly $0.35 or $0.36—about 60% higher than current levels. On the flip side, a drop below $0.16 could spark a sell‑off toward $0.10. Investors are watching those exact levels to decide whether to join buyers or cut losses. DOGE Price Forecast Digital Coin Price is on the optimistic end. They predict Dogecoin could go past $0.37 before year‑end and even test its old high of $0.74 again. Market Catalysts Could Tip The Scales Dogecoin’s swings often mirror the wider crypto space or follow social media buzz. A surge in Bitcoin or Ethereum prices could carry DOGE higher, while a broader sell‑off would magnify losses. Some traders also keep an eye on endorsements from well‑known figures and major exchange listings. Related Reading: Bitcoin Nears Climax, But A Twist Awaits—Analyst Reveals Key Insight For now, patience may pay off. Traders will look for volume to confirm any move past $0.22 or under $0.16.

If volume steps back in, Dogecoin could pick a clear direction—either a strong rally or a deeper correction.

2025-06-21T01:30:18,"MAGACOIN FINANCE Joins Bitcoin and Solana in Top 2025 Bullish Picks","The 2025 crypto bull run is in full swing, and a new wave of top picks is emerging as investors look beyond the usual giants. Bitcoin (BTC) continues to set the pace with record institutional inflows, while Solana (SOL) is drawing bullish forecasts from experts. Now, MAGACOIN FINANCE is joining this elite group, rapidly gaining traction as one of the most promising altcoins for the year. With Cardano (ADA), NEAR Protocol (NEAR), Kaspa (KAS), and Arbitrum (ARB) also in focus, the market is primed for dynamic moves. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Setting New Standards for Altcoin Launches MAGACOIN FINANCE is making waves in 2025 after raising over $10 million in its limited-access pre-sale. With a capped supply, bold branding, and a full audit by HashEx, the project is gaining serious traction. Investors can double their holdings using promo code PATRIOTS100X—analysts expect major upside ahead of its public launch. Momentum is building fast across social platforms, with growing interest from both retail and early-stage backers. Many now view MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the year’s most compelling altcoin opportunities. Bitcoin (BTC): Institutional Inflows and New Highs Bitcoin is riding a wave of institutional adoption and record spot ETF inflows, with leading analysts forecasting a 2025 top between $180,000 and $250,000. As BTC continues to break new ground, it remains the market’s anchor and a key benchmark for bullish sentiment. Solana (SOL): Bullish Patterns and Expert Forecasts Solana is working on a bullish cup and handle pattern, with seven reputable experts predicting 2025 highs ranging from $220 to $1,000 and an average target of $515. Ecosystem expansion and the potential for ETF approval are driving optimism, keeping SOL among the top bullish picks. Cardano (ADA): DeFi Growth and Layer-2 Upgrades Cardano is forecasted to reach as high as $5.66 in 2025, supported by DeFi adoption, scaling solutions like Hydra, and growing institutional interest. ADA’s innovative approach and network upgrades are drawing attention from both retail and professional investors. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): Steady Growth Outlook NEAR Protocol is projected to reach $2.91 by the end of 2025, with a cumulative ROI of +18% and a long-term outlook for continued ecosystem development. As NEAR’s fundamentals strengthen, it remains a steady pick for diversified portfolios. Kaspa (KAS): Volatility and High Potential Kaspa’s price could range from $0.08 to $0.65 in 2025, with some analysts predicting up to 620% gains if bullish momentum holds. Its unique consensus mechanism and growing adoption keep KAS on the radar for high-risk, high-reward traders. Arbitrum (ARB): Layer-2 Leadership Arbitrum continues to lead Layer-2 solutions for Ethereum, with ongoing upgrades and ecosystem growth supporting its long-term value proposition. As ARB’s adoption expands, it remains a favorite among DeFi-focused investors.

2025-06-21T01:19:43,"XRP Price Prediction: Analyst Declares ‘Only Two Paths Remain’ as XRP Tightens to Breaking Point","The XRP price has inched up to $2.17 today , with this consolidation happening as the crypto market loses 1.5% in the past 24 hours. The altcoin is now up by 1.5% in a week but down by 8% in a month, following weeks of escalating tension in the Middle East and little progress with regards to international tariffs. That said, XRP retains a strong 335% increase in the past year, while analysts are beginning to suggest that the coin nearing a pivotal tipping point. This could be in either direction, however, although XRP’s fundamentals have become increasingly strong in recent weeks, pointing to a very positive long-term price prediction . XRP Price Prediction: Analyst Declares ‘Only Two Paths Remain’ as XRP Tightens to Breaking Point Posting on X, analyst CasiTrades wrote that XRP’s “consolidation has finally reached its apex and something big is coming next.” Unfortunately, she suggested that a big dive is more or less as likely as a breakout, so traders may need to tread very carefully in deciding whether to buy or sell. The market is officially out of time! After months of tightening, the #XRP consolidation has finally reached its apex and something big is coming next. There are only two paths from here: either the explosive breakout we've been waiting for begins now, or we see one final… pic.twitter.com/xGRyaevRxX — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) June 18, 2025 The main point of her analysis was that, if XRP struggles to break through $2.25 for much longer, it could slide to lower levels, to $2.00 or “even $1.55.” However, she may have invalidated her analysis to some degree by suggesting, a reply to her own post , that to “be clear, I do think we’ll get that drop to support today or tomorrow.” This did not happen, with the XRP price hanging around the same $2.15 level it had on the day (Wednesday) she made these predictions. If we look at XRP’s chart today, we see that the coin’s resistance (red) and support (green) are indeed converging to a point where a big move may arrive. As for the other indicators, they suggest that the altcoin remains in an oversold position, which would imply a strong rebound. Source: TradingView Its RSI (purple) has been below 50 for much of the time since February, while its moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is also in an oversold space. So given that XRP remains one of the strongest coins in the market in terms of fundamentals, it should pick up again strongly soon, assuming that t he Israel-Iran conflict doesn’t escalate further . With listed firms buying up XRP , with XRP ETFs on the way, and with Ripple expanding its business , the XRP price could easily reach $2.50 by the end of July and $3 by September. Bitcoin Hyper Gains Momentum with $1.4 Million Presale: Next 100x Coin? XRP continues to be a very strong altcoin, but traders should always consider diversifying into newer tokens, allocating a small percentage of their portfolios to coins that may show strong volatility. This should include presale tokens, which can often rally big when they list for the first time, especially if they’ve had successful raises. And one sale gaining steam right now belongs to Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), an Ethereum- and Solana-based tokensed that has raised just over $1.4 million in its ICO. Bitcoin Hyper is quickly gaining momentum because of its exciting plans to launch a layer-two network for Bitcoin, providing the latter with a big boost in speed and scalability. It will make use of zero-knowledge proofs to provide greater efficiency and security, while it will also harness Ethereum and Solana virtual machines to achieve its greater throughput. On top of this, it’s planning to provide a platform for DEXes and DeFi applications, so that a thriving DeFi ecosystem can build on top of the Bitcoin base layer. Its native token HYPER will be necessary to pay for transactions, meaning that demand for the token will grow in step with the platform’s growth. Holders will also be able to stake it for a passive income, with investors able to buy it now by going to the Bitcoin Hyper website . It’s currently selling for $0.01195, although this will rise again later today.

2025-06-21T01:00:26,"Analyst Warns Of XRP Trap — „You’re Being Played”","CryptoInsightUK’s latest market briefing arrives with the sound of literal hammer blows next door, an accidental soundtrack to the pounding he expects traders to take before the next rally. In a thirteen–minute walkthrough of XRP, Bitcoin and Ethereum liquidity maps, the British analyst argues that the market is staging what he calls “a deliberate trap” designed to flush out weak hands, harvest stop-loss orders and maximise upside leverage for larger players—leaving retail participants “screaming, ‘Yay, we’re going to the upside,’ … only to find out they’ve been played.” The Trap Is Set, Warns XRP Trader He begins with XRP’s five-month down-channel that started at the New-Year peak, noting that price continues to hug the underside of a descending trend line. “We’re stuck below that trend line basically looking to see if this liquidity is going to get taken below us. My obvious opinion is that it is,” he says, underscoring the conviction that a sweep of resting bids below remains the path of least resistance. The flush, he contends, would “make our journey to the upside much better and much easier to navigate,” because it would reset funding, scare out late longs and reload the order book for what he still calls the next “parabolic expansion probably up towards the $8 to $12 region.” Related Reading: ‘Out of Time’: XRP Consolidation Hits Final Moment, Analyst Alerts The trap, however, may not be a straightforward vertical collapse. Charts, he reminds viewers, “love doing something like” an initial breakout that rallies 15-20%, convinces traders the bear-phase is finished, and then abruptly reverses into the deep liquidity pocket below. “That’s exactly how higher-highs-and-higher-lows type situations are supposed to get you frustrated,” he says, openly conceding that the pattern looks engineered. The phrase he never uses—manipulation—hovers unspoken over the analysis, but his rhetoric leaves little doubt: “This is how they test everybody.” Bitcoin, in his narrative, may serve as the decoy that sets the trap. The benchmark asset has already slipped out of its own wedge-like consolidation and, he observes, “does like to do this sort of thing” by staging premature upside breaks. He sketches a possible march toward $115,000 that would “delay the inevitable” and then give way to a liquidity hunt of its own. Even so, his mid-cycle price band for Bitcoin remains $150,000 to $220,000. That upside, he argues, justifies dollar-cost-averaging into altcoins even while keeping “a tiny bit of dry powder” in reserve for the washout he expects. Related Reading: XRP 5-Wave Count Shows When The Price Will Hit All-Time Highs Above $5 A more elaborate scenario involves a temporary dominance surge in Bitcoin to the 66 to 74% range. As Bitcoin siphons capital, alts such as XRP would “bleed out,” take the downside liquidity target, and only then reverse as cash rotates back into their order books. He illustrates the dance on twin TradingView panels—Bitcoin on the left, XRP on the right—before concluding that the rotational setup is “not highly likely” because it requires several macro-scale dominoes to fall in sequence. Still, he refuses to dismiss it, pointing to the strategic reserve bill in Washington as the sort of narrative catalyst that could spark a temporary Bitcoin-only rally and demoralise alt-holders. Macro-risk flickers through the commentary—wars that could “shove us down” in the near term—but he treats geopolitical stress as a catalyst for final capitulation rather than a thesis-killer. “The upside is so large it almost can’t be ignored,” he insists, framing the present chop as a high-volatility pause before a structural up-leg. Whether that leg begins only after a full flush or emerges from yet another fake-out remains uncertain, but the analyst’s message is unmistakable: traders who chase breakouts without accounting for hidden hands risk being liquidated first, spectators to the parabola they hoped to ride. For now he is content to wait “for the market to do its worst trick,” believing that the final shakeout will announce itself through a sudden, depth-piercing wick. “You’re being played,” he warns. The admonition is stark: if the playbook unfolds as expected, the pain will be quick. “If we get these levels, that’s where I’m putting the last bit of my dry powder in. It’s $1.80-ish, $1.90 maybe.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.16.

2025-06-21T01:00:17,"Bitcoin Takes a Breather While MAGACOIN FINANCE and Solana Shine Brighter","Intro: Market Rotations Put New Altcoins in Focus As Bitcoin steadies after a high-volatility run, traders are beginning to reallocate their attention — and capital — into newer, higher-potential altcoins. While legacy assets like XRP, Cardano, TRON, and Litecoin maintain their positions, it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE and Solana that are emerging as leaders in this new wave of market momentum. Bitcoin (BTC) Cools After Recent Rally Bitcoin has taken a step back this week, consolidating after weeks of bullish action. Without a strong macroeconomic catalyst or breakout headline, BTC appears to be in a pause phase. Many investors are holding long-term, but traders looking for faster ROI are rotating out of Bitcoin and into assets showing more immediate traction and structural benefits. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Where Smart Traders Are Moving Now While older assets tread water, MAGACOIN FINANCE is gaining strong traction — and doing so with substance behind the hype. Here’s why it’s drawing capital quickly: 170B Fixed Supply: No future dilution or inflation. Staking Is Live: Traders can lock in passive rewards while holding. HashEx-Audited: The project has cleared a full security audit. No VC Control: Community-driven, with zero centralized ownership traps. On-Chain Strength: Wallet growth and long-hold behaviors continue to rise. Bonus Offer Active: The PATRIOTS100X bonus gives early buyers extra leverage before listings arrive. As the broader market steadies, MAGACOIN FINANCE is proving it has more than potential — it has the behavior, structure, and timing that typically precede breakout runs. Solana (SOL) Sustains Ecosystem Leadership Solana continues to rank among the most active blockchains by daily transactions and user activity. Its thriving ecosystem across NFTs, gaming, and decentralized apps has helped it remain relevant even in market lulls. While SOL hasn’t posted a dramatic price jump recently, its steady technical strength keeps it high on the list for altcoin exposure. XRP Eyes Resolution But Moves Cautiously XRP is still waiting on regulatory clarity, with the joint motion to release $125 million from escrow signaling that the SEC case may soon reach its conclusion. While this has sparked optimism, traders remain cautious due to the token’s sensitivity to legal headlines. The potential for an ETF or integration with SWIFT remains, but timing remains uncertain, prompting some capital outflow into earlier-stage coins. Cardano (ADA) Faces Community Confidence, Price Hesitation Cardano continues to build through its developer community, with founder Charles Hoskinson maintaining visibility. Still, ADA’s price remains closely tied to the overall market and has not generated its own breakout narrative in this cycle. It remains a long-term favorite, but in the short term, its momentum is flat, causing some traders to explore alternatives. TRON (TRX) Keeps Stability But Lacks Excitement TRON remains a strong network for stablecoins and high-frequency transactions, and Justin Sun continues to push updates and global partnerships. However, TRX hasn’t seen much volatility or growth this month. It is viewed as a stable layer, but traders looking for explosive upside are rotating to assets with more dynamic incentive models. Litecoin (LTC) Struggles for Relevance Litecoin has historically been called the silver to Bitcoin’s gold, but recent market activity has left LTC in the background. Without new technical developments or major ecosystem updates, it’s seen largely as a legacy hold — not a growth vehicle — and traders are beginning to overlook it during active rotation cycles. Final Thoughts Bitcoin is taking a well-earned pause, and while Solana maintains strong traction, it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that is turning heads for those chasing early-entry upside. Meanwhile, XRP, Cardano, TRON, and Litecoin continue to hold their lanes — but lack the same urgency or structure that’s driving attention toward this new contender.

2025-06-21T00:30:40,"Google Gemini Predicts Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price for July 1, 2025","As the crypto market navigates another wave of uncertainty, attention has turned to Shiba Inu (SHIB), the popular meme coin currently trading between $0.0000117 and $0.000012 as of June 20, 2025. With July just nine days away, investors and enthusiasts alike are curious about what lies ahead. To provide a data-informed forecast, we turned to Google Gemini, one of the most advanced AI models, to predict SHIB’s potential price movement by July 1, 2025, based on recent technical and market trends. SHIB’s Current Market Landscape Over the last month, SHIB has experienced a noticeable decline, dropping between 19% and 21%. Even over the past week, the asset has shown a slight downturn, ranging from 0.7% to 11%. Despite this bearish stretch, SHIB appears to be holding its ground above a key support level near $0.000011. This has led to early signs of buyer accumulation, as traders begin to see potential value at current price levels. A notable development on SHIB’s price chart is the emergence of a falling wedge pattern, a structure commonly viewed as a precursor to a bullish breakout. Meanwhile, order book data from exchanges shows that buy orders currently outweigh sell orders—another subtle indicator of a possible trend reversal forming beneath the surface. Technical Barriers and Bearish Pressure Despite encouraging signs of accumulation, SHIB still faces significant technical resistance. It remains below its 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages—both simple and exponential—levels that typically mark bearish dominance. There’s also concern that a death cross may be forming, a signal that occurs when short-term averages cross below long-term ones, often interpreted as a warning of continued downward momentum. At this point, market sentiment around SHIB is largely described as “neutral” to “bearish.” Traders appear cautious, awaiting a clear technical or fundamental catalyst to shift the short-term outlook. Google Gemini’s Price Forecast for July 1, 2025 Using all of this recent data, Google Gemini provided three distinct price projections based on possible short-term market outcomes: Conservative Scenario: Stabilization Without a Catalyst In a muted environment where no significant market-wide or SHIB-specific catalyst appears, Gemini suggests SHIB may continue consolidating above its current support. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Price action is expected to remain range-bound, possibly reclaiming minor resistance around $0.000012 but lacking the momentum to push significantly higher. In this case, the price is likely to hover between $0.000012 and $0.0000125. Moderate Scenario: Technical Recovery Begins In this scenario, the falling wedge begins to play out as a bullish reversal, with accumulation strengthening and perhaps minor positive developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, such as updates to Shibarium adding momentum. If SHIB can begin reclaiming some of its moving averages, Google Gemini projects a modest yet meaningful move higher, placing the expected price range between $0.0000125 and $0.000014 by July 1. Bullish Scenario: Breakout Triggered by Major Catalyst A stronger, more optimistic outcome would require a significant trigger, such as a large token burn, a breakthrough development in Shibarium, or an overall rally in the crypto market, especially led by Bitcoin and Ethereum. In such a case, SHIB would likely break decisively from the falling wedge, push above the 200-day EMA, and aim to reclaim the highs it saw earlier in May or June. Under these conditions, Gemini forecasts the price could rise sharply to anywhere between $0.0000145 and $0.000017. Final Thoughts Shiba Inu’s path over the next nine days remains closely tied to both technical structures and broader market behavior. While current trends lean slightly bearish, underlying signals such as buyer interest and chart patterns suggest the possibility of a short-term recovery. Ultimately, according to Google Gemini, SHIB’s price by July 1 will depend heavily on whether accumulation continues, resistance levels are broken, and any fresh catalyst ignites momentum. In a quiet market, SHIB may remain stable with modest gains. But if the right conditions align, the meme coin could surprise traders with a sharp upside move.

2025-06-21T00:00:53,"Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Price To Reach $1.9 As WXY Correction Completes","A new Dogecoin price prediction suggests that the number one meme coin could be gearing up for a massive breakout toward the $1.9 target. This bullish projection comes as a complex WXY corrective pattern is completed on the Dogecoin chart, signaling the potential end to its current consolidation phase and downtrend. Dogecoin Price Rally To $1.9 Incoming A TradingView crypto market analyst, known as HodlAhmad, has identified a major bullish setup for Dogecoin, forecasting that the meme coin will finally surpass the $1 mark and potentially climb to $1.99 in the coming months. With DOGE currently priced at $0.17, this projection would mark a solid 1,071% increase. According to the analyst’s chart report, Dogecoin’s price action has just completed a distinct WXY corrective pattern , followed by an ABCDE triangle—an indication that the larger Wave 2 correction may have come to an end. This pattern is often a precursor to a powerful impulsive move, and in this case, signals the possible start of Wave 3, which is seen as one of the powerful and longest waves in the Elliott Wave cycle . Following the completion of Wave 2, HodlAhmad emphasizes that Dogecoin may now be entering the sub-wave 3 of Wave 3, a stage typically known for rapid pace expansion and strong momentum. This phase is considered one of the most aggressive portions of the Elliott Wave pattern and has historically delivered the most significant gains during bullish cycles . Based on Fibonacci Extension levels depicted on the price chart, the analyst projects a potential rally to the 2.618 Fib level near $1.99 and even higher to $2.72 at the 3.618 extension, if bullish momentum persists. Notably, reaching the upper target at $2.72 would represent a strong 1,500% gain from Dogecoin’s current market price. Analyst Unveils 32RR Dogecoin Trade Setup To capitalize on the anticipated breakout to $1.99, HodlAhmad has outlined a DOGE trade setup with a targeted entry zone between $0.154 and $0.172. This range is supported by key Fibonacci Retracement levels at 78.6% and 6.18%, respectively, as well as previous breakout structures, making it a strong demand zone for accumulation. The analyst has placed this trade’s stop loss around $0.110, a level that could invalidate Dogecoin’s current bullish impulse wave count if broken. In this setup, the 24-hour trading volume of over $616.43 million, marked at the bottom of the chart, adds weight to the current accumulation zone, hinting at strong market participation just above the stop loss level. From this base, the price targets are set progressively higher, beginning with $1.27 at the 1.618 Fib extension, $1.99 at the 2.618 Fib, and $2.72 at the 3.618 extension. This setup, dubbed the “32RR trade” by the TradingView analyst, presents a significant risk-to-reward ratio for traders positioning for this projected price increase.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-to-reach-1-9/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Elliot Wave Theory|Fibonacci Retracement Levels|HodlAhmad|meme coin|WXY Corrective Pattern",cryptocompare
2025-06-21T00:00:53,"Bitcoin’s Dominance Could Kill Altseason Dreams, Analyst Warns","According to an analyst on X, Bitcoin’s grip on the market looks too strong for altcoins to break free any time soon. Bitcoin’s price ticked up to around $104,000 after climbing 0.4%. It had dipped briefly to $103,000 but buyers stepped in fast. Related Reading: Crypto Gets A Green Light From Spanish Banking Giant That push drove it back toward the $105K mark. At the same time, the US Federal Reserve held interest rates steady, keeping traders on alert for any ripple effects. Bull Market Support Band Explained Based on reports, the Bull Market Support Band sits between two key moving averages. One is a 20‑week simple moving average. The other is a 21‑week exponential moving average. Together they form a zone that Bitcoin Dominance has used as a springboard all year. When dominance tests that area, it usually bounces higher instead of dropping further. $BTC.D – As long as the Bitcoin Dominance continues to hold its Bull Market Support Band, there will be no altseason. pic.twitter.com/XCYDyuDxP2 — Luca (@CrypticTrades_) June 19, 2025 Historical Support Tests Bitcoin Dominance fell from about 56% in June 2024 to 54% in July of that year but found support. It also slipped from 58% down to 56% between late December 2024 and January 2025. Each time, the support band held firm. More recently, dominance dipped to 61% on May 14 after peaking at 65% on May 7, only to recover to 64% in a matter of days. $BTC.D – As long as the Bitcoin Dominance continues to hold its Bull Market Support Band, there are no risks of this being a distribution range for $BTC. ✅ pic.twitter.com/GS8r9jNIpB — Luca (@CrypticTrades_) June 19, 2025 Analyst Warnings And Scenarios Other experts see a different picture. Bitcoinsensus warns dominance could “fall off a cliff” before any altcoin season kicks off. That view suggests a sudden drop, maybe giving altcoins their moment. An analyst points to a possible double‑top pattern in dominance. If Bitcoin can’t clear resistance, money might flow into altcoins. But if dominance breaks higher, some believe Bitcoin could aim for a fresh record. Limitations Of Dominance Metric Dominance only measures Bitcoin’s share of total crypto market cap. It can slip if stablecoins flood in or if new tokens launch, even when altcoins aren’t rallying. And a rise in dominance can mean altcoins are selling off.

A pattern that works for months can break when the climate changes. In the end, the Bull Market Support Band offers a clear trend line. It shows that Bitcoin is still the favorite for many investors. Yet relying on one technical tool can miss bigger moves driven by real‑world news or fresh blockchain data. For now, though, Bitcoin’s dominance looks safe—unless something big shifts in the weeks ahead.

2025-06-21T00:00:32,"Shares of Coinbase and Circle Explode in Value After US Senate Passes Landmark Stablecoin Bill","The shares of the crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and the stablecoin company Circle (CRCL) saw significant gains after US senators passed a landmark law to regulate stablecoins. The US Senate on Wednesday voted 68-30 with bipartisan support in favor of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act ( GENIUS Act ), which would establish a framework for stablecoin issuers. The bill seeks to require stablecoin issuers to have full asset backing, monthly reserve disclosures and yearly audits for those with over $50 billion in market capitalization. Says pro-crypto Wyoming Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis after the passage of the bill, “Today brings us one step closer to becoming a welcoming home for digital asset companies. Now, let’s finish the job & pass market structure legislation to fulfill POTUS’ vision of becoming the crypto capital of the world.” Following the development, the shares of Circle surged by 33.82%, closing at $199. The company behind USD Coin (USDC), the second-largest stablecoin by market cap, just launched as a publicly traded company earlier this month with an initial public offering (IPO) price of $31.00 per share. Coinbase’s shares also rose by 16.32% and closed at $295.29 on Wednesday. The House of Representatives must still pass a version of the bill before the proposed legislation heads to President Donald Trump’s desk for approval.

2025-06-20T23:30:14,"Holding 2,000 XRP Today Could Make You a Millionaire in 2040. Check the Simple Math","As interest in long-term cryptocurrency investments continues to grow, one question among XRP holders has attracted significant attention: Can a modest portfolio of 2,000 XRP tokens reach a valuation of $1 million by the year 2040? While the idea may seem ambitious given current market conditions, a range of experts and analysts have weighed in on its feasibility. Evaluating the Entry Cost and Portfolio Range At XRP’s current price of approximately $2.16, acquiring 2,000 tokens would cost around $4,320. Wallets holding this amount fall into the mid-tier bracket on the XRP Rich List , which groups accounts with holdings between 1,000 and 5,000 tokens. Data shows that approximately 8.25% of on-chain wallets fall within this category. To reach a portfolio value of $1 million, the price of XRP would need to increase substantially. Specifically, the token would have to reach $500, representing a 23,048% increase from its present value. Whether such growth is achievable over the next 15 years remains the primary point of debate. Realistic Assessment of Market Capitalization Achieving a $500 valuation would place XRP’s market capitalization at nearly $29.5 trillion, assuming its circulating supply remains at about 59 billion tokens. For context, this figure would far surpass the current total global cryptocurrency market cap of roughly $3.27 trillion and even exceed the estimated value of the global gold market, which is approximately $23.18 trillion. These comparisons underscore the magnitude of the challenge ahead. Analyst Predictions for XRP by 2040 Despite these challenges, multiple forecasting platforms have offered optimistic projections. Forecasts from AI platforms like Grok and Gemini suggest a highly optimistic outlook for XRP by 2040. Grok predicted that XRP could trade between $1,160 and $1,450 by then. If accurate, this would push the value of a 2,000 XRP portfolio well beyond $1 million. Gemini provided a wider price range, estimating XRP could rise between $76 and $1,868, depending on positive regulatory shifts, adoption by financial institutions, and overall market conditions. At the upper end of this forecast, 2,000 XRP could be valued at over $3.7 million. Crypto trading platform Changelly has also released long-term estimates. It anticipates that XRP will be priced between $647 and $810 by 2040. At these levels, a 2,000-token portfolio could be worth between $1.29 million and $1.62 million. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, not all analysts are as bullish. Telegaon offers a more conservative outlook, suggesting XRP could reach a high of $160 by 2040, with a minimum estimate of $119. Even at its projected peak, this would place a 2,000-token portfolio at $320,000, far short of the millionaire benchmark. Community Sentiment and Influencer Insights The community continues to speculate on the long-term potential of the asset. Influencers like Austin Hilton have emphasized the importance of increasing token holdings over time and maintaining long-term patience. Edward Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy, has noted that early adopters may one day share stories of success rooted in high-risk bets. Coach JV, a well-known market analyst, believes that Bitcoin reaching $1 million could create favourable conditions for significant XRP gains as well. While the possibility of turning a 2,000 XRP investment into $1 million exists in theory, it depends on a combination of optimistic scenarios, including massive price appreciation, market expansion, and regulatory clarity. Most predictions acknowledge the growth potential, but few see the $500 per token mark as a realistic outcome in the current climate. Investors should remain cautious, informed, and grounded when evaluating such long-term projections. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-06-20T23:00:15,"Traders Are Rotating Into MAGACOINFINANCE Over Legacy Coins Like XRP and BTC","Intro: From Legacy Leaders to Strategic Starters Traders are making moves this month — and not in the direction you might expect. Instead of doubling down on market giants like Bitcoin and XRP, many are shifting toward emerging plays with higher upside potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a clear beneficiary of this shift, as early investors seek asymmetric returns before mainstream exposure kicks in. Bitcoin (BTC) Loses Momentum to Emerging Tokens Bitcoin remains the dominant force in the crypto market, but its price action has cooled. Following several weeks of volatility, BTC is consolidating while traders reassess risk appetite. As momentum fades, many short-term investors are pulling capital from Bitcoin in search of assets with sharper growth trajectories and more aggressive token incentives. XRP Holds Institutional Hopes Amid Uncertainty XRP continues to garner institutional interest, especially with the Ripple vs. SEC case nearing closure. The recent motion to release $125 million from escrow has improved sentiment, and speculation around an XRP ETF remains alive. Still, traders are cautious — split between long-term optimism and short-term uncertainty. This has opened the door for new capital rotation into earlier-phase projects like MAGACOINFINANCE. MAGACOINFINANCE: Where Trader Sentiment Is Converging While Bitcoin and XRP consolidate, MAGACOINFINANCE is quietly gaining market share in trading circles — and it’s doing so by offering something most new projects lack: real structure. With a 170 billion token cap, a fully audited smart contract (verified by HashEx), and live staking incentives, the fundamentals are solid. But what’s especially driving rotation is the behavior on-chain — early buyers aren’t exiting. They’re staking, holding, and accumulating. This isn’t just about tokenomics — it’s about timing. The promo PATRIOTS100X adds a compelling bonus to early purchases, reinforcing the idea that even modest entries could deliver outsize results in 2025. As larger-cap assets stall, MAGACOINFINANCE’s tailored setup is making it a standout pick among risk-aware yet reward-seeking investors. Other Coins Holding Position Without Breakout Power Polygon (MATIC) remains a respected name in scaling and enterprise adoption but hasn’t seen a breakout this cycle. VeChain (VET) continues building in the supply chain space, though it hasn’t gained traction in trading volumes recently. Injective (INJ) is maintaining relevance in decentralized finance circles but lacks momentum. Polkadot (DOT) is making ecosystem progress, yet the token’s performance hasn’t aligned with its roadmap, pushing traders to reconsider their positions. Final Thoughts As capital rotates out of high-profile but slow-moving assets like Bitcoin and XRP, the hunt for stronger ROI leads directly to MAGACOINFINANCE . Its combination of staking, locked supply, credible auditing, and community ownership offers traders something rare — structure and excitement in one place.

2025-06-20T23:00:00,"Whales Watch From Afar as Lightchain AI Attracts the Kind of Grassroots Movement That Top 10 Coins Can’t","While whales watch cautiously from afar, Lightchain AI is quietly igniting a grassroots movement that top 10 cryptocurrencies struggle to replicate. With $20.9 million raised in its presale and tokens priced steadily at $0.007, Lightchain AI is attracting a diverse base of retail investors and builders who believe in its intelligent, scalable infrastructure. Unlike established giants weighed down by large holders and slow adoption, Lightchain AI’s momentum is powered by active community engagement and consistent buyer interest. This organic growth signals a shift in market dynamics—where real innovation and grassroots support may outperform sheer market cap and hype in the evolving crypto landscape. Top 10 Coins Hold Value but Struggle With Community Engagement Despite holding contrary positions from the market, most popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Binance Coin (BNB) experience difficulty in maintaining active community participation. Even as these assets draw in institutional money and volume, their communities often don’t have the buzz of the latest hot new project. Take Bitcoin and Ethereum, for example—what became of the grassroots efforts surrounding those two? Even though both fulfilled their role of providing the footings from which to build, it was a long time before we saw any real discussion outside of price talk. By contrast, newer tokens, such as Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX), have built-up active communities by offering developer grants and interactive arena, promoting more user participation. This contradiction emphasizes the need of community participation to maintain motivation and innovation in the cryptocurrency space in the long term. Lightchain AI Builds Momentum Through Organic, Grassroots Support Lightchain AI is building momentum not through aggressive marketing, but through genuine, grassroots support across crypto circles. As Stage 15 closes and the Bonus Round begins, its fixed pricing and transparent vision are resonating with early adopters who value real utility. Much of this support stems from its decentralized infrastructure—highlighting tokenomics designed for long-term health and builder incentives over insider gains. The full reallocation of the 5% Team Allocation toward developer grants has further fueled its community-first perception. Traders, developers, and researchers are engaging with the protocol for what it delivers: a purpose-built AI blockchain with scalable workflows, privacy-preserving data handling, and gas-optimized execution. Lightchain AI’s rise is quiet—but it’s rooted in credibility. Lightchain AI- Powering the Future, One Block at Time Lightchain AI is sparking a revolution, built on scalable AI infrastructure and decentralized collaboration. With advanced gas optimization slashing costs for AI tasks, it’s never been easier—or more efficient—to innovate. In a bold move, the original 5% team allocation was completely removed and redirected into growth initiatives like developer grants, ecosystem incentives, and core protocol development. This builder-first approach is turning heads, drawing in retail traders and dedicated ecosystem contributors alike.

2025-06-20T22:59:27,"On-chain Wealth Turns Deadly: Crypto Kidnapping in Paris Forces Victim to Hand Over Ledger Wallet","A 23-year-old man was reportedly kidnapped in Maisons-Alfort, a suburb of Paris, in what marks the latest in a growing number of violent incidents linked to cryptocurrency. According to a Thursday report by Le Parisien, the victim was abducted earlier this week and held for several hours as his captors demanded access to both cash and his Ledger wallet. The attackers reportedly targeted the victim and his partner, forcing them into a situation that French police are now investigating as kidnapping and unlawful confinement by an organized gang. Paris Suburb Sees Another Crypto-Linked Kidnapping as Attacks Escalate The incident began on Tuesday morning when the young couple left their home by car. They had set out on errands. When the driver couldn’t find parking, his partner got out while he circled the neighborhood. A 23 year old man was kidnapped Tuesday while out shopping in Maisons-Alfort, France. The attackers called his partner and demanded his Ledger and 5,000 EUR in cash. She complied & he was released. This is the 10th wrench attack this year in France! https://t.co/ZE7WK8vtcQ — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) June 20, 2025 Minutes later, she received a message from her partner claiming he had an urgent work issue. Unaware of the real situation, she returned home. That’s when the event quickly escalated. Her phone rang. It was a video call. On the screen wasn’t her partner, but another man. The person on the call demanded that she gather €5,000 in cash and a Ledger hardware wallet and place them in a bag. “Violence was used to make him talk,” a source told Le Parisien, indicating the kidnappers had knowledge of the man’s crypto holdings. The woman, following the instructions, waited outside her home with the bag. A third person arrived and collected it. By 5 p.m., the victim called his partner. He had been released in the nearby town of Créteil and was on his way back. French authorities have not disclosed any details about the man’s identity or the exact amount of crypto involved. Police from Val-de-Marne are now handling the case. A source confirmed that the woman has been handed over to the judicial police. “This is a sensitive case,” a police official said. The Anti-Banditism Brigade has reportedly made several arrests in connection with a series of recent kidnappings targeting crypto holders. Tuesday’s attack is the tenth such case to surface in France in recent months, raising alarm among local crypto users and law enforcement. Investigators believe the victim was carefully selected and that the perpetrators had detailed information about his assets and routines. Surge in Violent Crypto Kidnappings Sparks Security Concerns Across Europe and Beyond The recent wrench attack in a Paris suburb is just the latest in a chilling trend of violent crimes targeting crypto holders in 2025. According to data compiled by Bitcoin security advocate Jameson Lopp, at least 32 wrench attacks have occurred globally this year, nearly one-third in France alone, putting 2025 on track to surpass the previous record of 36 incidents in 2021. The assaults are becoming more brutal and calculated. Early this month, a crypto influencer in Essonne was kidnapped and beaten after attackers demanded €50,000 in crypto. They released him after discovering his wallet was nearly empty. In January, David Balland, co-founder of Ledger, and his wife were kidnapped in rural France . Balland also had a finger cut off as part of a ransom attempt. Twelve suspects were later arrested . David Balland, co-founder of French cryptocurrency hardware wallet manufacturer @Ledger was kidnapped alongside his wife in a shocking incident that left him with severe injuries to one of his hands. #Ledger #CryptoCrime https://t.co/IvCjWeovS6 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 24, 2025 In one of the most harrowing cases this year, the father of a young poker player-turned-crypto trader was abducted by men posing as delivery workers . The kidnappers demanded up to €7 million and sent a video of the victim’s finger being severed. He was later rescued by police in a dramatic operation. French police freed the kidnapped father of a #crypto entrepreneur in a nighttime raid on Sunday after he was held hostage – and mutilated – for two days. https://t.co/9THKJ3UMMw — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 5, 2025 Other attacks have similarly targeted families of crypto executives. In May, Pierre Noizat, CEO of Paymium, narrowly avoided tragedy when a group attempted to kidnap his daughter and grandson . That same month, authorities charged 25 suspects linked to a broader kidnapping ring across Paris. The violence hasn’t been confined to France. In the U.S., victims in New York and Las Vegas were kidnapped at gunpoint , one of them was driven over 70 miles into the Arizona desert by assailants seeking access to his wallet. Security experts say the increase in ransom demands, mutilation, and family targeting reflects a new phase in crypto-related crime.

The past few days have been characterized by the leading cryptocurrency trading around $105,000, with neither bulls nor bears taking control. Despite the overall consolidation, a subtle yet significant signal is starting to flash beneath the surface, particularly on the 4-hour chart, that might send Bitcoin to a new all-time high soon.

Price has been forming lower lows, while the RSI has been printing higher lows. This mismatch serves as an early indicator that selling momentum is fading, and a reversal to the upside could follow. The previous instance of this pattern directly preceded a sharp move from a $74,000 low in early April to above $111,000 in just a few weeks. What Does This Divergence Mean For Bitcoin’s Price? Bullish divergences on mid-timeframe charts like the 4-hour have a reputation for being the first reversal signals when supported by rising volume. In Bitcoin’s current case, the appearance of this pattern again could mean that the recent retracement from $111,800 has run its course. With RSI now trending upward even as price presses slightly lower, Bitcoin may be witnessing another hidden accumulation phase before its next leg higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Trend Above $100,000: The Good News And The Bad News If the pattern holds true to its previous performance in April, the leading cryptocurrency could be setting up for another push toward new all-time high levels. Bitcoin is currently not far off from a new all-time high, as it is only about 5.5% away from its price peak. Based on this, another strong breakout could easily aim beyond the previous $111,800 high. Although Bitcoin’s price is relatively stagnant for now, the presence of this bullish divergence is a reminder of how quickly things can change. The previous bullish divergence ended up with a 50% price surge. A similar performance from the current price level would translate to another target above $160,000. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,700, up by 1.4% in the past 24 hours, already showing signs of the bullish divergence signal coming into action.

2025-06-20T22:00:17,"ChatGPT’s 42-Signal AI ETH Price Forecast Suggests Consolidation with Breakout Potential","ChatGPT’s o3 Pro AI model digested 42 live indicators and yielded a focused Ethereum price forecast as ETH hovers near $2,419.57 amid short-term consolidation and longer-term bullish cues. With the RSI near 43 and MACD showing bearish momentum, Ethereum trades between immediate support around $2,485 and resistance near $2,557 . Volume remains moderate at roughly $20.15 billion daily. Source: Cryptonews After oscillating in a $2,480 – $2,547 range today, longer-term EMAs indicate underlying strength as the price sits above the 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs yet below the 20-day EMA. The following analysis was conducted using one of ChatGPT’s AI models, the new o3 pro. The predictions were then reanalyzed and edited together for enhanced readability while maintaining analytical precision. Technical Pulse: Neutral Consolidation Amid Longer-Term Strength Ethereum’s daily chart on Binance reveals a market in a holding pattern. As of June 20, 2025 , ETH trades around $2,432.47 , having opened near $2,523 and swung between a high of $2,547.5 and a low of $2,368.68 . This tight band reflects short-term consolidation after prior moves, with RSI at 43.12 hovering just below neutral and MACD displaying a negative histogram around 45.35 , indicating mild bearish momentum without decisive breakdown. Volatility remains moderate, with daily price swings staying within roughly $180 – $201 , consistent with ATR levels implied by today’s high-low range. Source: Cryptonews Moving averages convey a mixed but overall bullish medium-term structure. The 20-day EMA sits slightly above the price at $2,557 , suggesting short-term resistance and consolidation pressure. In contrast, the 50-day EMA at $2,438 , the 100-day EMA near $2,372 , and the 200-day EMA around $2,476 lie below the current price, indicating that on medium and longer timeframes, the trend retains a bullish orientation. Source: TradingView Price holding above those EMAs argues that dips near $2,438–$2,485 could attract buyers defending the uptrend, while reclaiming the 20-day EMA would signal a resumption of upward momentum toward higher resistance zones. Volume remains moderate at approximately 204,000 ETH traded daily, reflecting steady institutional and retail participation but not yet a surge. Trading within the $2,485–$2,547 range shows a balanced tug-of-war, with sellers cap rallies near the 20-day EMA, while buyers step in near the 50-day EMA or intraday lows. This kind of balance often sets up a breakout once a catalyst appears. For now, the short-term mood is neutral to slightly bearish, yet the broader medium-term uptrend means any drop below immediate support will likely be brief and shallow. Any successful reclaiming of the 20-day EMA could quickly attract momentum traders. Support & Resistance: Defining the Key Zones Immediate support emerges at today’s low around $2,485 . Should that level fail on heavier volume, the next anchor lies near the 50-day EMA ( ~$2,438 ), a zone where buyers may re-enter if the broader uptrend remains intact. Source: TradingView Beneath that, psychological and structural support around $2,400 coincides with a stop-loss region that many traders reference, but a sustained break below the 50-day EMA would shift focus toward deeper corrective territory closer to major support zones around $1,800–$1,900 , though such a move would likely require major negative catalysts given Ethereum’s longer-term strength. On the upside, immediate resistance resides at the 20-day EMA near $2,557 , a hurdle that price has struggled to clear. Beyond this, today’s high at $2,547 marks the short-term ceiling; clearing that area convincingly on strong volume could open a path toward the next major resistance zone between $2,700 and $2,800 , where prior swing highs reside. Above that, strong resistance lies in the $3,200–$3,400 range, levels reached in previous bullish runs but requiring robust catalysts and sustained bullish conviction to revisit. Within the current consolidation, the interplay between support near $2,438–$2,485 and resistance near $2,557 shapes trading dynamics. Traders watching daily closes above $2,557 look for confirmation of renewed upside, while breaches below $2,485 , especially with volume pickup, indicate potential deeper tests of the 50-day EMA. Given moderate volatility, breakout or breakdown beyond these pivot points could occur quickly once momentum shifts, with daily ranges of roughly $60–$70 broadening if ATR expands. Liquidity & Market Depth: Assessing Fuel for Moves Ethereum’s market cap is around $293.41 billion , and daily trading volume exceeds $21.91 billion , which shows deep liquidity across major venues. Binance order-book depth typically absorbs sizable orders with manageable slippage, a necessary condition for sizable moves when volume surges. Institutional participation appears average, with stablecoin flows and on-chain activity reflecting continued usage. Order-book clusters often form around support zones near $2,480–$2,500 , offering a buffer against light sell-offs, while resting asks near $2,550–$2,580 can absorb minor rallies until a catalyst drives stronger buying. Monitoring volume-weighted moving averages in tandem with order-book snapshots can reveal subtle accumulation. If volume-weighted metrics trend upward while price lingers below the 20-day EMA, selective accumulation may be underway despite short-term consolidation. Given deep liquidity, a meaningful breakout above $2,557 would likely require noticeable volume expansion, indicating a shift in conviction. Conversely, a breach of $2,485 supported by higher sell volume could lead to a swift move toward the 50-day EMA at $2,438 . On-Chain Insights: Usage Trends and Network Health Ethereum’s on-chain metrics continue to illustrate robust ecosystem engagement. Source: Etherscan Active address counts and transaction volumes across layer-1 and layer-2 networks reflect ongoing usage. Nearly 1% of circulating ETH is held as a reserve asset on layer-2 networks, while whales are accumulating at rates unseen since 2017 . These behaviors suggest a demand baseline beyond mere speculation, as participants lock up ETH for staking, layer-2 activity, DeFi participation, and reserve strategies. Statements from Ethereum co-founders emphasize Ethereum’s vision as a “master ledger for the world,” underpinned by layer-2 expansion and ecosystem growth.

Tamper resistant and tamper evident (via slashing and transparency). Incessantly progressively decentralizing… https://t.co/jMaHHpK2na — Joseph Lubin (@ethereumJoseph) June 19, 2025 Rising stablecoin supply on Ethereum and surges in layer-2 usage indicate that transaction demand may persist or increase, supporting fee-related demand for ETH. At the same time, staking yields and burning mechanisms under EIP-1559 continue to reduce net supply , providing a deflationary tilt that underlies longer-term bullish narratives. However, token unlock schedules or large whale movements warrant attention, as large accumulation by whales can bolster price floors if buying outpaces selling. Yet, any large-scale sell-offs could stress support zones. Overall, on-chain metrics point to a healthy network with sustained usage and structural supply factors that favor longer-term strength, even as short-term price consolidates. Social Sentiment: Gauging Community and Market Mood LunarCrush data for Ethereum reveals a broadly constructive but cautious sentiment environment. A Galaxy Score around 41 suggests a mildly bullish bias, while an AltRank near 380 indicates high engagement relative to other assets. Engagement metrics totaled billions of interactions, and mentions remain elevated in the tens of thousands, with creators numbering nearly 37,570 voices shaping narratives. Sentiment sits around 83% positive or neutral-positive, indicating prevailing optimism tempered by awareness of broader market uncertainty. Social dominance near 13.35% indicates Ethereum’s outsized share of crypto chatter, meaning major news or shifts can drive swift sentiment swings.

If Ethereum does the same… you know the number. pic.twitter.com/isvpngSw4K — Merlijn The Trader (@MerlijnTrader) June 19, 2025 Recent commentary points out themes such as Ethereum’s evolving role as layer-1 backbone, strong technical setups compared to historical BTC patterns, and potential breakout scenarios following consolidation in the $2,170–$2,480 zone. In sum, social sentiment reflects confidence in Ethereum’s fundamentals and network potential, but traders remain watchful for confirmation cues. Macro & Ecosystem Catalysts: Potential Triggers Ethereum’s price trajectory will hinge on a mix of ecosystem developments and broader market forces over the coming months. Major catalysts include progress on layer-2 rollouts, prominent DeFi or additional stablecoins launches driving transaction spikes, and announcements around protocol upgrades that enhance scalability or interoperability. Stablecoin supply on $ETH is skyrocketing! pic.twitter.com/uh3TOLv5zn — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) June 19, 2025 Broader crypto sentiment, influenced by macro liquidity conditions, regulatory clarity around digital assets, and institutional adoption (e.g., ETFs, corporate treasury allocations), also heavily affects Ethereum’s outlook. Given its central role in decentralized finance, geopolitical events influencing risk appetite may also prompt rotations away from or back into Ethereum. Ecosystem dynamics, such as shifts in gas fee economics or competition from other layer-1s, factor into longer-term narratives but are less likely to drive abrupt short-term moves unless tied to concrete network performance data or notable project launches. Three-Month ETH Price Forecast Scenarios Over the next 90 days, Ethereum’s price will likely follow one of three broad paths, shaped by the interplay between technical conditions, on-chain trends, social mood, and macro catalysts. Range-Bound Consolidation (Base Case) In the absence of a decisive catalyst, ETH may trade within approximately $2,400–$2,600. Short-term momentum remains neutral-to-slightly bearish below the 20-day EMA, but medium-term trend stays bullish as price holds above the 50-, 100-, and 200-day EMAs. On-chain usage continues steadily, and social sentiment retains modest optimism without euphoria. Source: TradingView Volume and volatility remain moderate, yielding choppy swings that savvy traders can exploit between support near $2,365–$2,461 and resistance near $2,557–$2,600. Longer-term holders may await clearer directional signals before adding exposure. Bullish Breakout Toward $3,000+ (Bull Case) A convergence of positive factors, such as a sustained surge in layer-2 activity, a major upgrade announcement, or a broad crypto rally fueled by macro liquidity or ETF news, could lift ETH above the 20-day EMA near $2,557. Confirmation requires robust volume expansion pushing price through $2,600 and toward the $2,700–$2,800 zone, where prior resistance resides. On-chain metrics would need to register spikes in transaction volume or staking inflows, while social sentiment (Galaxy Score rising above 60 , engagement uptick) reinforces confidence. Source: TradingView Upon clearing $2,800 , the path to $3,000 and beyond becomes feasible, potentially revisiting multi-month highs if market conditions remain constructive. Traders should manage risk with trailing stops and watch for profit-taking near key resistance zones to guard against sharp pullbacks. Deeper Correction Toward $2,200–$2,300 (Bear Case) Should negative catalysts emerge, such as disappointing ecosystem news, regulatory headwinds, or broader risk-off driving crypto-wide declines, ETH could breach near-term support around $2,485 and test the 50-day EMA near $2,438. Confirmation of deeper weakness would involve volume-backed breakdown below $2,438 , accompanied by RSI falling below 45 and MACD deepening negative. Source: TradingView On-chain signs might show slowed transaction growth or unwind of staking positions, while social sentiment shifts toward caution or fear. In this scenario, the price may retest zones at around $2,300–$2,200 , reflecting deeper consolidation territories. A breach below those could invite further selling pressure toward $2,000 or lower. However, given Ethereum’s structural strength, such moves would likely be met with increased buying interest at perceived value levels. Risk management via stop-loss placement and hedging strategies becomes paramount. ETH Price Forecast: Balancing Technicals, On-Chain Health, and Sentiment Ethereum’s current consolidation reflects a market balancing short-term caution against medium-term bullish undercurrents. Price wedged between roughly $2,485 support and $2,557 resistance underlines a waiting game: will on-chain usage or macro-driven optimism tip momentum upward, or will external headwinds trigger a test of deeper support? Participants should treat each swing as a diagnostic: does price hold near $2,485 on steady or rising transaction volumes? Does reclaiming the 20-day EMA coincide with an uptick in layer-2 activity or a surge in staking inflows? Conversely, does a breach of $2,438 align with waning on-chain metrics or broader crypto weakness? Breakout or Consolidation? Ethereum’s current range between roughly $2,485 support and $2,557 resistance reflects a market where short-term momentum leans neutral to slightly bearish under the 20-day EMA. Yet, the medium-term structure remains bullish as the price is above 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs. Over the next 90 days, the interplay of on-chain usage trends, social sentiment shifts, ecosystem milestones, and macro dynamics will determine whether ETH breaks higher toward $3,000+ or undergoes a deeper correction toward $2,200–$2,300. Traders should watch for daily closes above $2,557 to validate bullish continuation or breakdowns below $2,485–$2,438 to signal caution. At the same time, watching layer-2 activity, staking trends, user engagement, and wider market indicators can either back up or challenge recent price action.

2025-06-20T21:55:12,"Former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky waive rights to bankruptcy distributions from the defunct firm","Former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky and three related entities waived rights to bankruptcy distributions from the defunct crypto lender. The waiver cemented Mashinsky’s position as the party responsible for the collapse of Celsius. It also distanced him from making amends to the victims who lost funds. The agreement filed on Monday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York prohibited Mashinsky, AM Ventures Holdings Inc., Koala1 LLC, and Koala3 LLC from receiving any bankruptcy proceeds. The court document stipulated that all of Mashinsky’s claims submitted or scheduled on his behalf be “withdrawn, disallowed, and shall receive no distribution” under the bankruptcy plan. Mashinsky and the entities related to him were permanently barred from receiving any recovery in the Celsius bankruptcy, allowing those reserved assets to be redistributed to other creditors. However, even as Mashinsky claimed to have agreed to forfeit the assets that the government traced directly to the proceeds of his crimes, his wife asserted that she had a superior claim to the property. Her assertions would reduce what the government seized and returned to Mashinsky’s victims if credited. Attorney Clayton says America’s investors deserve better U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, Jay Clayton, said the Celsius founder targeted retail investors with false promises, used their funds to place risky bets, and profited tens of millions of dollars (~$48M). At the same time, his customers lost billions (~$4.7B). Crypto influencer Tiffany Fong lost 3.1 BTC and 11.6 ETH to Celsius (over $300K at today’s prices). However, Clayton believes that America’s investors deserve better. The waiver agreement, therefore, stipulated that since the court had disallowed claims from Mashinsky and related parties, all the money and assets (crypto and company shares) that were being held for them could be released for distribution to other creditors who were owed under the bankruptcy payout plan. Mashinsky was ordered by the bankruptcy court to pay a $50K fine and forfeit $48.3 million. However, despite this specific ruling, the order clarified that it did not affect other claims, counterclaims, or defenses that the Plaintiffs, Mashinsky, AMV, Koala1, and Koala3 might have in other legal proceedings, whether in the main case or other lawsuits. Celsius has made progress in returning value to affected users, distributing over $2.5 billion to more than 251K creditors as of August 2024. However, despite the progress, reports indicated that over $1 billion in claims from ~121K creditors were filed this year alone, highlighting the scale of the liabilities Celsius faced and the number of individuals and entities impacted. Clayton also pointed out that validating and categorizing claims remained a monumental task. Mashinsky admits to giving Celsius customers ‘false comfort’ In court, Mashinsky admitted to giving Celsius customers “false comfort” by giving an interview in 2021 in which he said Celsius had received approval from regulators for its “Earn” program, which it had not. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan also said the former CEO misled Celsius’ customers to persuade them to invest, and artificially inflated the value of his company’s proprietary crypto token. He also failed to disclose that he had been selling his CEL holdings. However, Mashinsky owned up to his wrongdoings and vowed to do whatever it took to atone for his mistakes. Attorney Clayton claimed that Mashinsky marketed Celsius as the safest place for crypto, and encouraged customers to “unbank” themselves by transferring crypto assets to the platform. He repeatedly misrepresented key aspects of Celsius’s business and finances throughout his tenure to attract customers and retain their assets. His false claims covered the safety of Celsius’s yield-generating activities, its profitability, the sustainability of high reward rates, and the risks associated with depositing crypto assets on the platform. Mashinsky and others orchestrated a years-long scheme to mislead customers about the CEL token. They manipulated CEL’s price by spending hundreds of millions purchasing it on the open market to artificially inflate its value. They sometimes used customer deposits to fund these market purchases, without disclosing that to customers. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-06-20T20:55:30,"Ethereum ETF inflows have surged for six straight weeks","Ethereum ETFs are finally waking up after months of being ignored. After launching in July 2024 with barely any excitement, these funds are now pulling in cash for the sixth straight week, and have booked inflows in eight of the last nine weeks. According to SoSoValue, this is the most consistent interest Ethereum ETFs have seen since they started trading. The same products that were being called zombie funds earlier this year are suddenly alive and pulling in real money. This renewed appetite comes as the second-largest crypto by market cap finds itself back in the middle of regulatory actions in the US. Traders are also paying attention again, thanks to new progress around stablecoins, which mostly run on the Ethereum network. Source: SoSo Value A key event was the IPO of Circle, the company behind the second-largest stablecoin. That, combined with a leadership shake-up at the Ethereum Foundation, is drawing institutions back in. Institutions quietly re-enter as arbitrage opportunities grow Ben Kurland, CEO of research firm DYOR, said big players have been changing strategy. “What we’re seeing is institutional recalibration,” Ben said. “After the initial ETH ETF approval fizzled without a price pop, smart money started quietly building positions. They’re betting not on price momentum but on positioning ahead of utility unlocks like staking access, options listings, and eventually inflows from retirement platforms.” So far, Ethereum ETF inflows have reached around $3.9 billion. That’s tiny compared to bitcoin ETFs, which pulled in $36 billion in their first year. But Ethereum is starting to catch up. Chris Rhine, who heads liquid active strategies at Galaxy Digital, pointed to one reason why. “With increasing acceptance of crypto on Wall Street, especially now as a means for payments and remittances, investors are being drawn to ETH ETFs,” Chris said. The arbitrage window is also helping. Right now, the CME basis on Ethereum—the gap between futures and spot prices—is wider than Bitcoin’s. This gives traders a chance to go long on Ethereum ETFs and short on futures, squeezing out profits. That strategy is simple and repeatable. It’s also one of the forces behind the steady ETF inflows we’re seeing now. Even though the money is flowing into ETFs, the price of Ethereum itself hasn’t moved. It’s down this month. Over the past month, it’s basically flat. For the year, it’s fallen 25%. That’s not a small drop. Ethereum has struggled with its identity. Since its last major upgrade, revenue is down. Solana is gaining ground. Traders aren’t sure what Ethereum’s long-term value looks like anymore. There’s also macro pressure. This year has been full of geopolitical noise, and that has kept volatility high across crypto. In March, Standard Chartered cut its Ethereum price target by more than half. Even then, the bank said there’s still a chance the coin recovers by the end of the year. The recent ETF inflow spike already slowed down, but it hasn’t reversed. Bitcoin momentum adds fuel to Ethereum demand While Ethereum plays catch-up, Bitcoin is doing what it always does; moving the market. After hitting an all-time high in May, Bitcoin fell 10% over the next nine days. Now it’s almost fully recovered. The rebound is powered by institutions, policy, and market structure. The IBIT ETF has already hit $70 billion in assets in just 341 days. That’s more than five times faster than SPDR Gold ETF’s record. There’s also a clear setup on the charts. The weekly chart of bitcoin futures has been climbing since late 2022. One key metric, the Average Percent True Range (APTR), shows how much the price moves over time, in percentage terms. Right now, the 10-week APTR is at 8.5%. That’s low, and it usually happens just before a breakout. Every time APTR dropped to around 9% or 7%, Bitcoin launched higher. On the daily chart, APTR is hovering between 3% and 4% over the past 10 trading sessions. That’s another low reading. Bitcoin is testing the $110,000 resistance level for the third time. Some traders are calling for a breakout, with a Fibonacci target set at $135,000.

2025-06-20T20:25:08,"Altcoin Launch Anticipated by the Entire Cryptocurrency Market Postponed Again – Why This Time?","The Pumpfun token auction and exchange listing, which attracted great attention in the cryptocurrency market, has been postponed once again. It was announced that the event, previously planned for June 25, has been moved to mid-July. According to sources familiar with the matter, Pumpfun’s token issuance and auction plan was first floated late last year. However, the event has been postponed several times since then. The project’s token auction is expected to reach a valuation of around $4 billion. The Pumpfun team is also continuing to sell token allocations to various crypto funds.

Max Burwick, founder of Burwick Law, described Pump.fun as “the ultimate evolution of the multi-level marketing scam”, arguing that the platform targets vulnerable individuals looking to make a quick buck. In a cease-and-desist letter sent in February by Burwick Law and Wolf Popper LLP, it was stated that many memecoins listed on the platform used copyrighted logos and names without permission. *This is not investment advice.
