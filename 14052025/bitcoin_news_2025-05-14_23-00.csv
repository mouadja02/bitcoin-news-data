In a May 14 X post from the US Capitol rotunda, Armstrong said as many as “60 [crypto] founders” had gathered in DC to support the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act, being considered in the Senate and a draft of the market structure bill moving through the House of Representatives. The Coinbase CEO said the Senate could consider another vote on the GENIUS Act “hopefully tomorrow” after it failed to get enough support from Democrats on May 8.“Like any good negotiation, there’s a lot of details to work out at the last minute, but we’ve been stressing the urgency of this,” said Armstrong.Many Democratic lawmakers have said they will not support any crypto-related legislation without a specific carve-out for President Donald Trump profiting from his digital asset ventures, like his TRUMP memecoin and his family-backed company World Liberty Financial.

A host of factors, such as falling Bitcoin and USDT dominance and a rally in select altcoins, suggest that an altcoin season may be around the corner.Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360However, not everyone is bullish in the short term. Alphractal CEO Joao Wedson said in a post on X that Bitcoin is at the “Alpha Price” zone, which could attract profit booking by long-term holders or whales.  Could Bitcoin challenge the all-time high? Will altcoins continue their rally even if Bitcoin consolidates? Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.Bitcoin price predictionBitcoin rebounded off $100,718 on May 12, indicating that the bulls are trying to flip the psychologically important $100,000 level into support.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIf the price maintains above $100,000, the possibility of a retest of the all-time high increases. There is stiff resistance in the $107,000 to $109,588 zone, but if it is crossed, the BTC/USDT pair could skyrocket to $130,000.The risk to the upside is a sharp pullback below the 20-day exponential moving average ($98,407), which could tempt several short-term buyers to book profits. That could sink the pair to the 50-day simple moving average ($89,952). Ether price predictionEther (ETH) skyrocketed above the $2,550 resistance on May 13, but the higher levels are attracting sellers.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe overbought level on the RSI signals a possible correction or consolidation in the near term. If the price slips below $2,550, the bears will try to strengthen their position by pulling the ETH/USDT pair below $2,400. If they can pull it off, the pair could extend the pullback to the 20-day EMA ($2,147).Contrarily, a bounce off $2,550 indicates that the bulls are buying on every minor dip. That enhances the likelihood of a rally to $3,000.XRP price predictionXRP’s (XRP) rally is facing resistance at $2.65, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded ground to the bears.XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThat improves the prospects of a rally above $2.65. Once the resistance is scaled, the XRP/USDT pair could ascend to $3. Buyers are expected to face significant resistance from the bears in the $3 to $3.40 zone.The 20-day EMA ($2.32) is the vital support to watch out for on the downside. If the price turns down sharply from $2.65 and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that bears remain sellers on rallies. That could result in a range formation between $2.65 and $2.BNB price predictionBuyers have kept BNB (BNB) above the breakout level of $644 but are struggling to push the price above the $675 level.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe rising 20-day EMA ($627) and the RSI in the positive territory indicate that buyers have an edge. A break and close above $675 opens the doors for a possible rally to the overhead resistance of $745.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the BNB/USDT pair could descend to the 50-day SMA ($603).Solana price predictionSolana (SOL) resumed its up move after breaking above the $180 resistance on May 13, but the bulls are struggling to hold on to the higher levels.SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bears have pulled the price back below $180 on May 14. If they sustain the lower levels, the SOL/USDT pair could skid to the 20-day EMA ($159). A solid bounce off the 20-day EMA suggests the bullish momentum remains intact. The bulls will then try to catapult the pair to $210.Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-day EMA signals that the breakout above $180 may have been a bull trap. The pair may then tumble to $153.Dogecoin price predictionDogecoin (DOGE) bounced off the breakout level of $0.21 on May 13, signaling that the bulls are trying to flip the level into support.DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe 20-day EMA ($0.20) has started to turn up, and the RSI is near the overbought territory, indicating advantage to buyers. A break and close above $0.26 signals the resumption of the rally. That opens the doors for a rally to $0.28 and thereafter to $0.31.Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below $0.21, it suggests a lack of demand at higher levels. The DOGE/USDT pair may then slump to the 50-day SMA ($0.17), which is likely to act as strong support.Cardano price predictionBuyers have successfully held the retest of the neckline in Cardano (ADA), indicating buying on dips.ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls will try to resume the up move by pushing the price above $0.86. If they manage to do that, the ADA/USDT pair could pick up momentum and rally toward the pattern target of $1.01.This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the neckline. That suggests the bears have overpowered the bulls. That could sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($0.68).Related: Ethereum retakes 10% market share, but ETH bulls shouldn't celebrate yetSui price predictionSui (SUI) has been sandwiched between $4.25 and $3.90 for the past few days, indicating that the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate another leg higher.SUI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIf buyers propel the price above $4.25, the SUI/USDT pair could pick up momentum and surge to $5. Buyers may find it difficult to clear the overhead zone between $5 and the all-time high of $5.37.Alternatively, if the price turns down and closes below $3.90, it suggests that the bulls are booking profits. The pair may descend to the 20-day EMA ($3.57), which is likely to attract buyers. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will make another attempt to overcome the barrier at $4.25.Chainlink price predictionChainlink’s (LINK) up move is facing selling at the resistance line, but a minor positive is that the bulls have not ceded much ground to the bears.LINK/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($15.43) and the RSI near the overbought zone indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside. A short-term trend change will be signaled if buyers pierce the resistance line. The LINK/USDT pair could then rally toward the target objective of $21.30.Sellers will have to tug the price below the neckline to gain strength. That could pull the pair to the 50-day SMA ($13.96). A break and close below the 50-day SMA suggest the pair may remain inside the descending channel pattern for some more time.Avalanche price predictionAvalanche (AVAX) bounced off the breakout level of $23.50, indicating that the bulls have flipped the level into support.AVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThere is minor resistance at $28.78, but it is likely to be crossed.

If bears want to make a comeback, they will have to quickly pull the price below the 20-day EMA.

2025-05-14T17:37:33.000Z,"These five crypto figures vanished, died or fooled us all","Zerebro developer Jeffy Yu has been found alive at his parents’ home in San Francisco, days after faking his suicide on a livestream that launched a supposed posthumous memecoin past $100 million.Yu’s case isn’t the first time crypto has blurred the line between real death, faked death and something in between. From missing founders to sealed caskets, the industry has a long history of exits that left behind more questions than closure.Here are five unsettling cases — real, staged or unresolved — that continue to haunt the crypto world.1. Jeffy Yu faked his death, then his crypto pumpedA clip of Yu broadcasting his “suicide” circulated on May 4. The video showed him smoking a cigarette before pulling the trigger, then the camera dropped.Hours later, a scheduled social media post announced the posthumous launch of LLJEFFY, a memecoin described as his “final art piece.” The coin surged to nearly $105 million in market cap.LLJEFFY’s market fell to $5.63 million from its $105 million peak. Source: DEX ScreenerBut Yu wasn’t dead. Blockchain wallets tied to him kept moving. A copy of a letter — allegedly written by Yu — described the exit design as a response to ongoing harassment and blackmail.Yu’s obituary on online memorial site Legacy.com has now been removed. Source: Vee/Legacy.comReporters from The San Francisco Standard eventually found Yu at his parents’ home. He refused to comment on the suicide stunt or whether he profited from it.In the world of memecoins, this kind of spectacle isn’t new. In late 2024, Pump.fun’s livestream feature triggered a wave of stunts — suicide threats, animal abuse and other shocking acts — to pump token prices. The company shut it down and later relaunched a toned-down version.2. A crypto whistleblower’s descent into paranoia and possible deathIn February 2025, a suspected Chinese programmer who called themselves Hu Lezhi burned 500 Ether (ETH) (worth around $1.3 million at the time) and donated another 1,950 ETH (over $5 million) to various groups like WikiLeaks and the Ethereum Foundation. All of it came with onchain messages alleging that a hedge fund called WizardQuant (aka Kuande Investment) was using “brain-computer weapons” to control its employees — including Hu.Related: 4chan rises from the dead: How the imageboard moves crypto marketsThe messages read like sci-fi horror. Hu claimed he’d been a mind-control test subject since childhood and warned of a future where humans were nothing more than “puppets or complete slaves to the digital machine.”Hu Lezhi’s final messages before disappearing. Source: EtherscanIn one of his last messages, Hu said they would “leave the world” if they reached the final stage of becoming a “complete slave to the digital machine.” Some translated the series of messages as an onchain suicide note.To date, they haven’t re-emerged. And unlike Yu, Hu’s wallet hasn’t moved.3. The crypto whiz and the cryptic tweet before his deathOn Oct. 28, 2022, DeFi developer Nikolai Mushegian posted a chilling tweet: “CIA and Mossad and pedo elite are running some kind of sex trafficking entrapment blackmail ring… they are going to torture me to death.”By the next morning, he was found face-down in the surf near his beach house in Puerto Rico.A final tweet, a washed-up body, and silence louder than truth. Source: Nikolai Mushegian/fucnti0nZer0Mushegian wasn’t a random crypto kid. He was an early developer at MakerDAO and a key architect of the stablecoin ecosystem. He was also increasingly paranoid — or, depending on who you ask, increasingly aware. Critics dismissed the tweet as a mental health crisis, but others weren’t so quick to look away.Related: 8 major crypto firms announce US expansion this yearThe timing of his death sparked a wave of theories: assassination, targeted silencing or even MKUltra-style mind control.Officially, it was ruled an accidental drowning.4. Crypto investors can’t believe QuadrigaCX founder’s deathIn December 2018, Gerald Cotten, the 30-year-old founder of Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX, reportedly died in India from Crohn’s disease. But there was one massive problem: He was the only person with access to $190 million in crypto.Cotten’s case was so high-profile that it became the subject of a Netflix documentary. Source: Netflix/YouTubeAs news of his death spread, so did the questions. There was no public autopsy, his death certificate misspelled his name (spelling Cotten as Cottan), the casket was sealed, and a growing army of investors wanted his body exhumed for DNA testing.Quadriga officially declared bankruptcy in 2019. Thousands of clients were locked out of their funds. Eventually, investigators discovered the cold wallets were empty, prompting auditor EY to begin recovery efforts.Some suspected Cotten had run a Ponzi scheme for years and used his death as the ultimate escape plan. The rumors have not been confirmed, but the official story remains that he died a tragic death, as confirmed by Indian authorities. 5. Reports of Cryptoqueen’s death are greatly exaggeratedSelf-styled “Cryptoqueen” Ruja Ignatova, co-founder of the $4-billion OneCoin scam, hasn’t been seen since she boarded a Ryanair flight from Sofia to Athens in October 2017.Cotten left no access. Ignatova left no trace.Since then, rumors have swirled. Some say that she underwent plastic surgery and lives under a new identity or that she’s being protected by the Bulgarian mafia. A Bulgarian investigative outlet claims Ignatova was allegedly murdered in November 2018 on a yacht in the Ionian Sea and that her body was dismembered and dumped overboard under the orders of Bulgarian crime boss Christophoros Amanatidis to cover his ties to OneCoin.More recently, German officials reportedly assumed that Ignatova is in a South African suburb living with private security.Ignatova has been on the US FBI’s 10 Most Wanted list since 2022. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation raised Ignatova’s bounty to $5 million in June 2024.

This pattern has repeated twice, with a third consolidation currently underway.Bitcoin 4-hour chart.

Currently, Bitcoin is consolidating between an upper range of $105,700 and a lower range of $100,678. If the pattern holds, Bitcoin might retest the $100,000-$102,000 level before potentially breaking above $110,000.

Though her term at the CFTC was expected to last until April 2028, the Association said Mersinger is set to leave the agency on May 30.The departure of Mersinger, who has served in one of the CFTC’s Republican seats since 2022, opens the way for President Donald Trump to nominate another member to the financial regulator. Rules require that no more than three commissioners belong to the same political party. Like the Securities and Exchange Commission, the CFTC is one of the significant US financial regulators whose policies impact digital assets. Lawmakers in Congress are currently working to pass a market structure bill to clarify the roles each agency could take in overseeing and regulating crypto.This is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/cftc-commissioner-summer-mersinger-blockchain-association?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-14T15:00:00.000Z,"The facet of TradFi most ripe for disruption is equities","Opinion by: Mike Cahill, co-founder and CEO of Douro LabsDespite the institutional frenzy around crypto and the ubiquitous narrative of democratized access to investing, most of the world population is still barred from traditional wealth-building. Take the US, for example — here, the top 10% of earners own more than 90% of all stocks. On a global scale, it gets even worse: Billions of individuals don’t have the financial literacy, digital tools or minimum funds required to even access the most basic investment opportunities. Traditional institutions must do more than just invest in crypto to ameliorate this disparity — they must start employing digital assets for new use cases altogether. The facet of TradFi that is most ripe for disruption is equities. Investing in shares of private companies is an opportunity historically reserved only for the wealthy and hyper-connected. It is often siloed within the most economically advanced nations. Enhancing access to equities worldwide can be achieved, however, by injecting decentralized technology into three fundamental components of our financial system: price, execution and settlement.The bedrock of traditional financeEquities typically refer to shares of private companies, and they’re one of the most potent tools for wealth creation. On top of regulation, the main factor restricting access to equities is the infrastructure that underpins our financial system: stale and inaccurate pricing data, exclusive execution venues and painfully slow settlement periods. PriceTraditional equity markets are private. Here, pricing data is sequestered behind non-disclosure agreements, paywalls and groups of individuals who want to keep this information to themselves. Access to accurate, real-time pricing is what enables investors to make informed decisions, and it’s the crucial ingredient required to participate at all. If pricing data remains in the hands of those who can afford access or run in the right social circles, the system will continue to support only a small group of wealthy, privileged people.Recent: Ether sentiment hits yearly low but that could be a good thing: SantimentExecutionWhile many apps and platforms might make it seem like buying equities is as easy as pressing a button, the reality is that making these types of investments almost always requires strict vetting processes and minimum investment thresholds that everyday investors just don’t have access to. While it seems like public markets should be exempt from these barriers, brokerage fees and geographic limitations can still hamper participation. As a result, the current systems simply uphold the “rich get richer, poor get poorer” narrative.SettlementMost traders have experienced the frustratingly slow, highly bureaucratic and hazardous equity settlement systems in place today. It can take several days for a single trade to finalize. If it’s a cross-border trade, settlement times can lag even more. This results in capital being locked up, further dissuading smaller investors from participating — a snowball effect that keeps access to equities solely in the hands of the most elite traders. While these barriers are undoubtedly systemic, they’re also very solvable. As history has shown, time and time again, innovation always forces a shift. That’s where decentralized finance (DeFi) comes in.Reimagining infrastructure through DeFiDecentralized technologies have the potential to reimagine TradFi’s infrastructure to create a system that is faster, more accessible and more efficient and unlock new forms of equities participation. These include synthetic equity markets, tokenized private equity and even equity-based prediction markets.Regarding price, execution and settlement, DeFi and TradFi have the opportunity to work together, combining forces to offer a new foundation to the financial system that promotes equity, access and transparency. Decentralized price feeds offer real-time, accurate price data on equities that don’t come at the exorbitant price of a Bloomberg Terminal. They empower traders of any background or location to access fresh market data to trade equities with the same knowledge as the most elite traders. At the same time, decentralized execution platforms enable marketplaces for fractional, tokenized equity exposure. Now, if traders have an internet connection, they can make trades supported by smart contracts that automate trade matching, liquidity provision and order fulfillment. This empowers traders to purchase small, fractional stakes in these assets, empowering those even in the most rural and secluded areas of the world to own a piece of the same high-growth company as an accredited investor in the US. Finally, settlement in DeFi is almost instantaneous. That’s because blockchain removes the need for intermediaries, making it possible for equities to be traded in milliseconds. This dramatically reduces counterparty risk while unlocking capital for continuous use, making trading even more attractive to smaller players. Building the next generation of financeCreating a financial system that is genuinely democratized means more than encouraging institutions to buy and trade digital assets. It means rethinking the way our financial infrastructure exists and operates today. While equities are one of the most powerful wealth-building tools available, most of the global population still can’t access them due to geography, legacy and privilege. Through revolutionizing price, execution and settlement via decentralized innovations, equities can be entirely disrupted — closing the wealth gap that keeps billions of people at the mercy of a select few.Opinion by: Mike Cahill, co-founder and CEO of Douro Labs.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The rally has pushed Ethereum’s market dominance (ETH.D) back toward the critical 10% threshold for the first time since March.But the rising dominance accompanies signs of overheating, indicating that Ethereum bulls should not celebrate its recent rally just yet.Ether’s RSI most overextended since May 2021The strong recovery in Ethereum’s crypto market share has pushed its daily relative strength index (RSI) to its most overbought zone since May 2021, raising red flags for traders betting on further upside, at least in the short term. Historically, such extreme RSI levels on ETH.D have marked the beginning of major pullbacks. One notable instance occurred in early July 2024, when ETH dominance peaked near similar RSI levels. ETH.D daily performance chart. Source: TradingView Over the following 315 days, ETH.D dropped by more than 17.5%. The current RSI spike, again above 80, mimics a similar setup, suggesting that Ethereum could be nearing a local top in its market share.Adding to the bearish outlook, ETH.D remains below its 200-day exponential moving average (200-day EMA; the blue wave). This resistance level has repeatedly capped Ethereum’s dominance during previous recovery attempts.Previous overbought pullbacks have initially pushed Ethereum’s market share toward its 50-day EMA (the red wave).The ETH.D metric, therefore, risks declining toward its current 50-day EMA support at around 8.24% by June, suggesting potential capital rotation out of Ethereum markets to other coins in the coming weeks.Bearish divergence signals 15% ETH price dropOn the four-hour ETH/USD chart, a classic bearish divergence is emerging, where Ethereum’s price continues to print higher highs, but momentum indicators trend lower. Crypto trader AlphaBTC noted that ETH is showing “three clear drives of divergence,” a setup often preceding trend exhaustion. He added that key Fibonacci levels align with potential support zones, suggesting a pullback could be imminent.ETH/USD four-hour price chart.

Watching for these red flags will keep you safe while investing.The burgeoning cryptocurrency market, with its lack of centralized authority and a constant flow of inexperienced users, makes digital assets a prime target for scammers. Fake crypto investment platforms are a common scam method, masquerading as useful services for crypto traders.Before signing up for any crypto investment platform, it’s essential to learn the telltale signs of a scam. This article will detail what to watch out for and how to verify if a crypto investment platform is legitimate. These tips will teach you how to avoid crypto scams. Did you know? The FTC hosts a crypto scam detection guide that allows you to view common crypto scams, sorted by company name, scam type and other keywords. How to spot a crypto scamHere are 10 crypto investment scam red flags to watch for when choosing a cryptocurrency investment platform.1. Promising unrealistic returnsWhat to watch for: Fake crypto investment platforms will try to entice you with unrealistic promises, like “Make 1 Bitcoin in just a few days!” A legitimate crypto exchange won’t need to sell you with fake deals.How to verify: The platform’s services should speak for themselves. None of them will give you a special advantage over the other, especially not one that can net you a Bitcoin just days after signing up. This is one of those prime crypto scam warning signs.2. Fake team membersWhat to watch for: It’s easy to make an “our team” page on any website, let alone one offering a decentralized service. At a minimum, these pages should include photos, descriptions and links to LinkedIn or other verified social media platforms.How to verify: Double-check team pages for legitimacy. Some scammers might also set up fake social media pages, so scan those for authentic interactions and delve deep into each team member’s project history.3. Inconsistent white paperWhat to watch for: Let’s be honest, most scammers won’t expect customers to read their project white paper. It’s probably something they threw together in ChatGPT or even plagiarized from a legitimate project.How to verify: Read a project’s white paper in-depth and watch for legitimate use cases. Make sure the project solves a real problem, has a legitimate purpose and a realistic plan for the future. Don’t fall for buzzwords!Did you know? Justin Sun, founder of Tron’s long-standing blockchain platform, has been accused of plagiarizing Ethereum’s white paper.4. False endorsementsWhat to watch for: Just as it’s super easy to fabricate an “our team” page, scammers can place fake endorsements all over their home page. It’s as quick as copying and pasting a company logo like Forbes.How to verify: Instead of trusting an exchange’s webpage, look up news releases and other proof of these supposed endorsements. Cointelegraph provides a directory of legit exchanges to help you identify fake crypto websites.5. Lack of regulatory informationWhat to watch for: Now, regulatory requirements may vary depending on whether you’re looking at a centralized or decentralized platform, but if you’re looking at the former, know that centralized platforms cannot operate without regulatory approval from your government.How to verify: Typically, you can check a government database to confirm if a platform is licensed. If it’s not, it may not be trustworthy. For example, the CEO of Tether (USDT) refuses to comply with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. The company is known for its resistance to comply with regulatory policies, causing industry-wide suspicion.6. Pushy sales tacticsWhat to watch for: Pushy sales tactics are a big red flag. If a platform reaches out to you through social media, such as through a direct message on X, Discord or Telegram, you can be sure it’s a scam. Scammers might claim to be an employee or crypto influencer ready to provide you with an “exclusive offer” or “limited time deal.” How to verify: A real exchange would never reach out to potential customers like this, especially via social media. Social media DMs are widespread crypto scam tactics.Did you know? Some top crypto scams in 2024 were phishing attacks, rug pulls and fake airdrops. 7. Fake location/contact infoWhat to watch for: Crypto investment platforms with a real product, even decentralized ones, will have contact information. Even Uniswap has a support email with which to get in touch. Centralized entities should also have addresses of their offices, ones that you can cross-reference with Google Maps for legitimacy purposes. How to verify: If a crypto investment platform is missing any contact information, consider that a red flag. This is an easy sign to miss.8. Fake reviewsWhat to watch for: Tech products, blockchain-based and otherwise, feature user reviews front and center on their websites. That said, you can tell if these are real or manufactured. Keep an eye out for reviews with repetitive language and a lack of a critical eye, which only praise the platform. Glowing reviews are often fake, possibly even written by AI.How to verify: Search for platform reviews on Reddit and other social media sites. Other users will tell you if the platform is legit or not. If a platform has no social media accounts, there is more reason to avoid it.9. Fake airdrops or giveawaysWhat to watch for: Some fraudulent platforms may offer airdrops or giveaways as promotions to attract positive attention. However, participating in the fake airdrop might require inputting a wallet seed phrase or private key. How to verify: Legitimate airdrops will be announced on social media platforms like X, the platform’s blog on Medium or its official website. They’ll only ask for your wallet address, nothing more.3. No fiat offrampingWhat to watch for: A crypto exchange with no fiat offramping means it’s not registered with local financial institutions. The platform might demand that you only work in crypto.How to verify: If you sign up for an exchange and it immediately asks you to send crypto into your wallet on the platform instead of linking a payment method like a bank or card, this is a big red flag.Cryptocurrency investment scams thrive on urging you to make rash decisions. It’s always best to be skeptical when choosing where to trade, invest or hold your crypto. Take your time, do your research, and double-check every piece of information a platform provides. These crypto fraud prevention tips will help keep you safe, protecting your assets and peace of mind. Use them to create a crypto scam checklist.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-spot-a-fake-crypto-investment-platform-10-red-flags?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-14T07:50:00.000Z,"The Q-Day Prize challenge, explained: Can quantum computers really break Bitcoin?","What is the Q-Day prize?              The Q-Day Prize is a challenge to make the Bitcoin network quantum resistant.On April 16, 2025, quantum computing-focused company Project 11 announced the “Q-Day Prize,” a competition to break a “toy version” of Bitcoin’s cryptography with a quantum computer. Contestants must complete the Q-Day Prize challenge by April 5, 2026.Their reward? 1 Bitcoin (BTC).The “Q” in Q-Day refers to quantum computing, the potential threat to many existing cryptographic security measures. But can quantum computers break Bitcoin? Let’s find out.Quantum computing and the threat to BitcoinBitcoin utilizes the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, a National Security Agency (NSA)-developed encryption algorithm. SHA-256 prevents brute force attacks against the Bitcoin network, as decrypting it with current hardware can take decades. However, the emerging threat to SHA-256 is quantum computing, a method of computing that harnesses quantum physics and is much faster than traditional computing.At a fundamental level, quantum computing utilizes quantum bits (qubits), which can exist in multiple states. This contradicts binary (traditional) computing, which uses binary bits (1s and 0s). In 1994, mathematician Peter Shor presented an algorithm for quantum computers to solve complex algorithms in seconds, rather than the decades it can take for conventional hardware. At the time, no hardware could effectively run it, but recent advances like Google Willow are nearing that capability.Quantum computing, when paired with Shor’s algorithm, can disrupt Bitcoin cryptographic systems as we know them. Shor’s algorithm allows quantum computers to solve complex math super fast, potentially threatening Bitcoin’s safety.Did you know? If quantum tech gets strong enough, Bitcoin’s current security could become obsolete, so developers are racing to create “quantum-proof” shields using new math that even Shor’s algorithm can’t break.                  Quantum threat to Bitcoin: How real is the danger?              Bitcoin is vulnerable to quantum computing, but how serious is the risk?When you create a crypto wallet, it generates two important things: a private key and a public key. The private key is a secret code, like a password, that you must keep safe. The public key is created from your private key, and your wallet address (like a bank account number) is made from the public key.You share your wallet address with others so they can send you cryptocurrency, just like you share your email address for someone to contact you. However, you never share your private key. It’s like the password to your email — only you need it to access and spend the money in your wallet.Your private key is like a master password that controls your crypto wallet. From this private key, your wallet can create many public keys, and each public key generates a wallet address. For example, if you use a hardware wallet, it has one private key but can create unlimited public keys (wallet addresses). This means you can have different addresses for each cryptocurrency supported by the wallet or even multiple addresses for the same cryptocurrency, all managed by a single private key.While generating a public key from a private key is straightforward, figuring out a private key from a public key is extremely hard — almost impossible — which keeps your wallet secure. Every time you send cryptocurrency, your private key creates a special code called a signature. This signature proves you own the funds and want to send them. The system that uses your private key, public key and signature to secure transactions is called the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).It is believed that quantum computing could reverse the process and generate private keys out of public ones. It is feared that this could cause many Bitcoin holders (especially whales and Satoshi-era wallets) to lose their funds. Bitcoin address types and quantum risksWhen you send Bitcoin, you use a specific address type to direct the payment. Each address type has unique features, affecting security, privacy and vulnerability to quantum computing attacks like Shor’s algorithm.P2PK address typesWhen you pay someone with Bitcoin, the transaction is typically considered a “pay-to-public-key” (P2PK). This was the most common payment method in 2009, according to a report from consulting firm Deloitte. Much of the original Bitcoin released at the network’s launch is held in wallets with the P2PK address type, primarily due to the fact that they’ve sent transactions since Bitcoin’s 2009 launch. These addresses are long (up to 130 characters), making them less user-friendly.Wallets with the P2PK address type are most susceptible to Shor’s algorithm, as it can brute force the private key from a P2PK wallet address. P2PKH address typesThere’s a second address type that’s more resistant to Shor’s algorithm: the pay-to-public-key-hash (P2PKH). P2PKH addresses are shorter and are generated from the hash (a unique, hexadecimal value) of a public key created using SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 algorithms instead of displaying the full key itself.These addresses are shorter (33-34 characters), start with “1,” and are encoded in Base58 format. Such addresses are widely used and include a checksum to prevent typos, making them more reliable.P2PKH addresses are more resistant to Shor’s algorithm than P2PK because the public key is hashed. The public key is only revealed when you spend from the address (not when receiving). If a P2PKH address never sends Bitcoin, its public key stays hidden, offering better protection against quantum attacks. However, reusing a P2PKH address (sending from it multiple times) exposes the public key, increasing vulnerability. Also, when you spend from a P2PKH address, the public key becomes visible on the blockchain, making transactions trackable.Taproot addressesTaproot is the newest address type, introduced in November 2021 via the Taproot soft fork. It uses Schnorr signatures instead of the ECDSA signatures used by P2PK and P2PKH. These addresses start with “bc1p,” use Bech32m encoding, and are 62 characters long.They offer better privacy. Multisignature (multisig) transactions look like single-signature ones, hiding complex spending conditions. However, Taproot addresses expose the public key (or a tweaked version), making them vulnerable to Shor’s algorithm, similar to P2PK. Did you know? Google’s “Willow” computer chip is capable of solving a complex problem in just five minutes. The same task would take a classical supercomputer 10 septillion (!) years.                  The race toward quantum-proofing Bitcoin              Quantum resistance is a real challenge, but not an impossible one.Quantum computers, still in early development, could one day use Shor’s algorithm to break Bitcoin’s cryptography by deriving private keys from public keys. This would threaten Bitcoin and other systems using SHA-256 or ECDSA (the algorithms securing Bitcoin transactions). However, this threat is not imminent, and solutions are already in progress.While some believe that Project 11 presented the Q-Day Prize to take down Bitcoin, the company claims this initiative is aimed at “quantum-proofing” the network.In July 2022, the US Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced four quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms resulting from a six-year challenge to develop such solutions.Quantum computing won’t develop in isolation, and centralized systems like government and financial networks could be bigger targets than Bitcoin’s decentralized blockchain. These systems use outdated cryptography, like RSA, vulnerable to Shor’s algorithm, and store sensitive data (e.g., banking records). Their single points of failure make breaches easier than attacking Bitcoin’s distributed nodes. The International Monetary Fund warns quantum computers could disrupt mobile banking, while Dr. Michele Mosca from the Institute for Quantum Computing highlights “harvest-now, decrypt-later” risks for centralized data (where attackers store encrypted data today to decrypt with future quantum computers). In 2024, the G7 Cyber Expert Group urged financial institutions to assess quantum risks, noting that centralized systems’ data could be exposed if intercepted now and decrypted later.Did you know? Many blockchain networks are exploring quantum-resistant algorithms, such as Quantum Resistant Ledger or Algorand. These quantum computing blockchain security methods present a few different approaches.                  How to increase your security against quantum threats              While the quantum computing cryptocurrency risk is less of a threat than one might think, it’s still best to stay prepared.Still, if you’re worried about Bitcoin quantum vulnerability, there are a few precautions you can take to secure your crypto finances.Avoid reusing public addresses: Most crypto wallets allow you to generate a new public address for every transaction. This practice will make it much harder to track your spending habits.Move funds to a private wallet: If you’ve been using the same public wallet address for some time, consider moving your funds to a new wallet with no history. This will help keep your spending habits private. Use a different blockchain network: Legacy networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum are considered less quantum resistant than newer networks with more modern security algorithms. Consider alternative networks with quantum resistance in mind.Stay informed: Pay attention to the results of the Q-Day Prize challenge, and stay up to date with quantum computing news so you can react accordingly. The best defense is an informed one.While quantum risk is not immediate, developers and cybersecurity experts are actively working on solutions to ensure long-term security. In the meantime, users should stay updated about Bitcoin protocol updates and best practices, such as avoiding address reuse, as the network gradually moves toward quantum resistance.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/the-q-day-prize-challenge-explained-can-quantum-computers-really-break-bitcoin?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-14T07:47:22.000Z,"Kima joins Mastercard sandbox to enable stablecoin card top-ups","Decentralized settlement protocol Kima has integrated into Mastercard’s sandbox program, enabling stablecoin-powered top-ups for prepaid cards directly from self-custody wallets.According to an announcement shared with Cointelegraph, Mastercard partners can now rely on Kima’s settlement infrastructure to allow their prepaid cards to be topped up with stablecoins, including USDC (USDC) and Tether’s USDt (USDT), from self-custody wallets across more than 10 blockchains. Kima CEO Eitan Katz said the integration shows that stablecoins can be practical for everyday use and remove friction and intermediaries from crypto-to-fiat conversions while expanding crypto usability.“Our goal at Kima is to eliminate barriers between digital assets and traditional finance,” Katz said.Related: Mastercard tokenized 30% of its transactions in 2024Infrastructure designed for interoperabilityKatz described Kima’s settlement system as asset-agnostic and designed to simplify cross-ecosystem payments, supporting public blockchains, private ledgers and traditional banking rails:“Kima’s asset-agnostic settlement layer is designed to abstract the complexity of transferring value across disparate ecosystems, whether that’s public blockchains, private ledgers, or even traditional banking systems.”According to the announcement, Kima’s infrastructure is aligned with Mastercard’s aim to bring stablecoins into mainstream financial usage. Katz rejects the Bitcoin and crypto hardliner vision of digital assets being contrapposed to fiat currency, claiming that “crypto and fiat must coexist seamlessly to reach their full potential.”Katz explained that Kima’s solution allows for easy crosschain interoperability and eliminates the reliance on intermediaries, custodians or complex smart contracts. This, in turn, reportedly enhances security and efficiency for all parties involved.Related: Mastercard links with Circle, Paxos for merchant stablecoin paymentsECB includes Kima in digital euro initiativeEarlier in May, the European Central Bank (ECB) included Kima in a list of 70 private sector partners tasked with helping with digital euro innovation. The firms on the list have signed up to work with the ECB to explore digital euro payment functionalities and use cases.“The breadth and creativity of the proposals highlights the digital euro’s potential as a catalyst for financial innovation in Europe,” ECB executive board member Piero Cipollone said at the time.Source: KimaDespite Kima’s institutional partnerships, Katz told Cointelegraph that “compliance shouldn’t mean giving up control of your funds or your data.” He said that know-your-client and Anti-Money Laundering checks are handled by third-party banks and virtual asset service providers at onboarding, and Kima never has access to the data. Katz added that “once a user is cleared, every transaction carries immutable metadata tags that our protocol-level engine checks against local rules.” This, he said, covers compliance “from the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation to Singapore’s regulatory guidelines — before settlement.”Katz said that “keys are kept entirely under the users’ control,” while cryptographic proofs still allow for compliance.“Institutions get a plug-and-play control layer and users enjoy true self-custody,” Katz added.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/kima-integrates-with-mastercard-sandbox-to-enable-stablecoin-card-top-ups?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-14T07:11:44.000Z,"Alarm bells ring in US over OpenAI’s crypto project World","World Network, the digital identity and crypto project of Sam Altman’s OpenAI, has alarmed privacy activists ahead of its United States launch, with observers concerned over its data collection and protection practices.World “is the opposite of privacy. It’s a trap,” said Nick Almond, CEO of FactoryDAO, on X. While the project claims to protect user privacy in the age of proliferating AI, it’s faced a slew of regulatory concerns across the globe.Formerly known as “Worldcoin,” the iris-scanning technology and its crypto token payout scheme are being probed by authorities in India, South Korea, Italy, Colombia, Argentina, Portugal, Kenya and Indonesia. In Spain, Hong Kong and Brazil, it’s outright banned.World’s latest foray into the US could prove to be CEO Sam Altman’s biggest challenge yet, where privacy concerns are heightened by a patchwork of enforcement that differs state by state.Varying privacy laws could leave World users open to discriminationOn April 30, Altman announced that World would set up in “key innovation hubs” in five states in the US: Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville and San Francisco. Would-be verified humans can scan their irises at these hubs, giving World unique biomedical markers. These markers, per World, can be used to prove one’s humanness when interacting with others on digital platforms. But as World expands into the US, an uncertain regulatory landscape could put people off and make it difficult for the platform to build user trust. Andrew Rossow, a cyber and public affairs attorney at Rossow Law, told Cointelegraph, “There is no comprehensive federal law specifically regulating biometric data (such as iris scans) in the US.”Indeed, laws differ state by state. Two states in which World will operate, Texas and California, have some form of legal protections on the books for biometric data. Users in the remaining three states, Georgia, Tennessee and Florida, must rely on federal law, which requires that “companies must be transparent and fair, but there are no special state rules for iris scans.”But even the existence of state law is no guarantee of protection. In Texas, there is no private right of action for biometric data — only the state attorney general (AG) can enforce the state’s Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier law. Altman announced World’s foray into the US market at a company event two weeks ago. Source: World“The effectiveness of user data protections, as it pertains to World, hinges almost entirely on the Texas AG’s priorities, resources and willingness to act,” said Rossow. A more aggressive AG could mean more robust protections, while “a less aggressive administration could deprioritize enforcement, which leaves consumers open and vulnerable to exploitation.”The potential for exploitation is one of the key factors driving activist efforts against systems like World. Privacy International, a privacy protection group that supported legal action in Kenya against World, states that in “the absence of strong legal frameworks and strict safeguards, biometric technologies pose grave threats to privacy and personal security, as their application can be broadened to facilitate discrimination, profiling and mass surveillance.”Related: Over 70 crypto firms join forces to tackle Big Tech’s AI monopolyAs far back as 2021, Amnesty International had raised concerns over discrimination and biometric systems’ applications of dubious methodologies. Such systems, they said, can “make inferences and predictions about things such as people’s gender, emotions, or other personal attributes, suffer from serious, fundamental flaws in their scientific underpinnings.”“This means that the inferences they make about us are often invalid, in some cases even operationalizing eugenicist theories of phrenology and physiognomy.”Not everyone is convinced of privacy watchdogs’ concerns. Tomasz Stańczak, co-executive director at the Ethereum Foundation, said that he has spent “over 100 hours” analyzing World, which is building on the Ethereum network. He added that it “looked very promising and much more robust and privacy-focused than my initial intuition.”Paul Dylan-Ennis, an Ethereum researcher and academic, said that he believes World’s tech “is likely strong in privacy terms” but admitted that the aesthetic could be putting people off: “Just some intangible Black Mirror-ness to it all.”Worldcoin faces mounting bans worldwideOpenAI may be doubling down on an American strategy, but other jurisdictions around the world are increasingly investigating, limiting or outright banning the firm’s activities. In 2023, regulators in India, South Korea, Kenya, Germany and Brazil began investigating the firm’s data collection practices. Spain became the first country to ban World data collection outright in March 2024. Related: North Korean spy slips up, reveals ties in fake job interviewThe Spanish Data Protection Agency previously told Cointelegraph that its course of action was based on reports from Spanish citizens. It claimed that Orb operators provided “insufficient information, collected data from minors and even failed to allow withdrawal of consent.”Following the ban, World published a blog post stating that it operates “lawfully in all of the locations in which it is available.” World has recently made its iris-scanning orbs more compact and transportable. Source: WorldGlobal regulators disagreed. Hong Kong followed Spain in May 2024 and ordered World to cease operations as it was allegedly violating the city-state’s Personal Data Privacy Ordinance.Further accusations of improper data collection practices followed, and a number of countries like Germany and, more recently, Kenya, have ordered World to delete the data of thousands of users, while Colombia and Argentina have issued hefty fines.In January 2025, Brazil’s National Data Protection Authority banned World outright, citing concern over the irreversible nature of data collection and the potential for World to influence economically disadvantaged people with the promise of crypto for their data. Opportunities in Japan and the USDespite protestations in various countries, the ID system is making inroads. In Japan, World is now a part of dating online. Spencer Rascoff, CEO of Match Group, which includes dating app Tinder in its portfolio, announced on May 1 that Tinder would be trialing World’s ID system on Tinder in Japan, “giving users a privacy-first way to prove they’re real humans.”Tinder users in Japan can swipe right with World ID-verified users. Source: WorldThe integration in Japan is yet to take off, but as Tinder is the most popular dating app in Japan, it provides a major use case for the World identity platform. In 2024 alone, it had some 1.38 million downloads.If World could score a Tinder partnership in the US, it would acquire 7.8 million monthly active members overnight. If it expanded to similar services like Bumble or Hinge — the next two most popular dating apps in the country — World will have captured 67% of the US online dating market, comprising the personal, unique identities of tens of millions of users. But privacy rights in the US are far from settled. In Texas, one of the states where World plans to operate, Google recently settled to the tune of $1.4 billion. The company paid the eye-watering sum to the state of Texas after settling two lawsuits alleging the firm of tracking user search and location data, as well as collecting facial recognition information. Elsewhere, in Illinois and New York, biometrics firms face court proceedings, while lawmakers take measures to curtail the collection of biometric data.Magazine: ChatGPT a ‘schizophrenia-seeking missile,’ AI scientists prep for 50% deaths: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/alarm-bells-us-openai-world-privacy-concerns?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-14T07:09:58.000Z,"Crypto VC deals drop in Q1, but funding more than doubles: PitchBook","Crypto venture capital deals in the first quarter of 2025 saw deal values jump even as the number of deals sank from the same quarter a year ago, says PitchBook.The venture research firm said in its May 14 Crypto VC Trends report for Q1 that 405 deals were made in the quarter, down 39.5% from the 670 deals made in Q1 2024, but slightly up from the 372 made in Q4 last year.However, the total value of deals in Q1 more than doubled from a year ago, jumping to $6 billion compared to $2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2024 and doubling from $3 billion in Q4 2024.PitchBook's senior crypto research analyst Robert Le said that despite macroeconomic turmoil over the quarter, “capital continued to seek crypto’s core utility rails.”VCs poured nearly $2.55 billion across 16 deals into businesses like crypto asset managers, exchanges, and financial services at a rate that far surpassed any other segment.Crypto infrastructure and development firms saw the next largest venture funding, fetching nearly $955 million across 30 deals.Web3-focused companies saw the third-most deals and funding, at 23 and $231.2 million, respectively. Source: PitchBook.Looking ahead, PitchBook’s Le said Circle’s pending initial public offering (IPO) “represents the most important price-discovery event for crypto equity since Coinbase listed in 2021.”If Circle is valued above the rumored $4 billion to $5 billion range, it could show venture investors that business models similar to Circle’s are profitable and sustainable while also providing a clearer benchmark for future exits.“A strong roadshow could therefore crowd in new late-stage capital and reset valuation expectations upward across the payments and infrastructure stack.”Circle has raised $1.18 billion in VC funding to date, according to PitchBook, which estimates a 64% chance that it will go public in the future.“Dollar-denominated settlement remains crypto’s killer application”Le noted that the market value of stablecoins grew 12% over the first quarter, from $202.3 billion to $227.1 billion, even as other cryptocurrencies saw their values fall or stagnate.“In our view, this divergence underscores a growing consensus: Dollar-denominated settlement remains crypto’s killer application, insulated—at least partially— from broader risk-off moves.”Le said PitchBook expected that near-term venture investments could increase, “especially in payment, remittance, and treasury-management startups that directly monetize stablecoin velocity.”Related: Bitcoin builders defend venture capital's role in layer-2 growthLe added that the $1.4 billion Bybit exploit in February — the largest in crypto history — may accelerate institutional demand for real-time proof-of-reserve tooling, improved custody solutions and middleware that simplifies key management.“Startups addressing those vectors should find a more receptive funding environment despite the broader valuation reset,” he added.Notable crypto venture-backed or growth-stage companies that received investment in Q4 2024.

2025-05-14T07:07:14.000Z,"Crypto swapper eXch shows signs of life after post-Bybit shutdown","Once a go-to swapper for hackers and drainers, eXch was shut down by German police in April — but continued activity suggests the story isn’t over.Without Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, eXch wasn’t your typical crypto exchange. It acted more like an instant swapper, allowing bad actors and cybercriminals to fly under the radar for years.Among its clients was the Lazarus Group. The North Korean state-backed hacking unit thrust eXch into the spotlight back in February, when it used the platform to funnel some of the $1.4 billion it stole from Bybit. When Bybit traced its stolen funds to eXch, it requested assistance — but the platform refused.This led to a fierce discussion over privacy versus security, but ultimately, eXch announced it would close its doors on April 17; on April 30, German authorities made it official.But according to security firm TRM Labs, the platform may have continued operating in stealth mode after the takedown. Here’s the rise, fall and afterlife of alleged crypto laundromat eXch.eXch shuts front door, keeps back door unlockedAlongside its shutdown announcement, eXch posted a message claiming it would not facilitate criminal proceeds. The post was removed within hours, and operations quietly resumed — signs of an internal disagreement or perhaps even a calculated attempt to lower visibility, according to TRM.CSAM-related fund flows traced to eXch. Source: TRM LabsGerman authorities seized eXch’s servers and confiscated 34 million euros ($38 million) in crypto, along with more than eight terabytes of data, effectively dismantling its public-facing infrastructure.Related: North Korean spy slips up, reveals ties in fake job interview“Just like we saw with Garantex rebranding as Grinex, eXch didn’t fully die after the shutdown. It quietly kept servicing a handful of partners via API, which meant laundering activity continued even after the public takedown,” said Jeremiah O’Connor, co-founder and chief technology officer of security firm Trugard.O’Connor added that it’s not unlikely for such platforms to serve loyal customers even after seizures.EXch website visited on May 13. Source: eXch“The people behind eXch.ch took full advantage of operating across multiple countries. The domain was registered through a UK-based provider, listed Switzerland as an admin location, hosted infrastructure in France, and had servers seized in Germany,” O’Connor said.It’s still unclear if eXch will kill its API or come back under a new name. TRM said in the May 2 blog post that the platform’s remaining back-end access continued to provide anonymization infrastructure for threat actors.No KYC, pooled liquidity draws illicit funds to eXchEXch’s origins trace back to 2014, according to “Fantasy,” lead investigator at crypto insurance firm Fairside Network. In an October 2024 investigation, Fantasy identified the platform’s first public appearance as a BitcoinTalk forum account promoting automatic swaps between Bitcoin (BTC), Perfect Money and BTC-e vouchers — payment methods commonly associated with high-risk transactions. Fantasy also traced the original Bitcoin wallet tied to eXch and found it was likely funded via BTC-e, the now-defunct crypto exchange shuttered by US authorities in 2017 for its role in laundering criminal proceeds.Fantasy’s forensic research found that the modernized form of eXch emerged in 2022, when its Ethereum hot wallet was first funded. Not long after, it became a hub for prominent crypto drainers.Monkey Drainer — the first known large-scale drainer-as-a-service operator — used eXch before its retirement. Other draining service providers like Pink Drainer and Inferno Drainer also passed funds through the platform, along with several major exploiters.EXch’s modern wallets traced to accounts held at Binance and OKX. Source: Fantasy/MetaSleuthEXch required no identity verification, allowing users to move funds with anonymity. That made it an attractive tool for cybercriminals looking to clean stolen assets.“EXch managed to stay active for years — despite facilitating obvious illicit activity — because there’s still a big gap between what regulators ‘can’ do and how fast technology is moving,” Amit Levin, former investigator at Binance, told Cointelegraph.“In today’s world, anyone can launch a smart contract or run a crypto service from anywhere, often without revealing who they are. And if there’s no registration, no KYC and no one to hold accountable, enforcement becomes close to impossible.”The platform also drew confidence from threat actors by using a pooled liquidity system that blended user deposits and withdrawals, making it difficult for investigators and law enforcement to trace the flow of funds.When eXch knew and did nothingEXch denied laundering funds for North Korean crypto hackers, and in its shutdown notice, it framed the project as an attempt by privacy enthusiasts to “restore balance” in the industry. It criticized Anti-Money Laundering enforcement and condemned companies offering address risk scoring APIs as “parasites” profiting off government fear.“Service providers in the crypto space are, for the most part, not decentralized; that is, they retain control over or access to customers’ assets, as demonstrated in the case of eXch,” Gal Arad Cohen, partner at S. Horowitz & Co, told Cointelegraph.“A financial intermediary operating in the crypto sector faces risks similar to those of traditional financial service providers and should, therefore, be held to equivalent standards and regulatory requirements,” she said.The closure of eXch is a “huge win” for crypto, according to Alex Katz, CEO of security firm Kerberus. However, Katz warned that bad actors can migrate to alternative projects, like THORChain, which received a shoutout in eXch’s unapologetic farewell manifesto.In the Bybit hack, decentralized swap protocol THORChain was used as the main bridge to swap around 500,000 Ether (ETH) to Bitcoin.EXch operators also used THORChain to allegedly obfuscate trails. Source: Tanuki42EXch stated that its partners would retain access to its API for a limited time, but future operations would depend on the “new management team.” The old team recommended setting up new liquidity pools to maintain seamless functionality and said it would provide consultations.It signed off with a defiant message: “Privacy is not a crime.”German authorities reported that $1.9 billion in crypto flowed into eXch since its inception. Its operators are suspected of commercial money laundering and running a criminal trading platform.Magazine: ChatGPT a ‘schizophrenia-seeking missile,’ AI scientists prep for 50% deaths: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-exch-signs-life-bybit-shutdown?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

He added that the tokens will be launched within the next two months.The so-called “G-tokens” will be used to raise funds from the public under the current budget borrowing plan, said Patchara Anuntasilpa, director-general of the Public Debt Management Office. He added that these were not debt instruments.“One big selling point of the token is that it allows more retail investors to become part of the digital economy,” he said, adding that for as little as $3, “they can invest in government bonds.” Until recently, retail investors have been limited or excluded from large investment product offerings in Thailand, which are predominantly aimed at institutional and wealthy investors.Finance Minister Pichai said the initial token mint is designed to “test the market” and investors will earn higher returns than bank deposits, but did not specify yields.Commercial banks in Thailand offer very low interest rates to savers, currently just 1.25% for a 12-month fixed deposit, which is much lower than rates set by its central bank, which has kept rates elevated until recently despite increasing economic woes. Related: Tether Gold enters Thailand with listing on Maxbit exchangeThe report noted that the asset was not a cryptocurrency.

This will be a 'risk on' environment for the foreseeable future.”Adding to the bullish sentiment, the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate dropped to 2.3% year-over-year in April 2025, the lowest since February 2021, down from 2.4% in March and below consensus forecasts of 2.4%.

Immediately following the vote, some lawmakers from both parties suggested they could reconsider the bill as early as this week, but without agreeing on a bipartisan path forward.After the GENIUS Act failed to proceed in a 48 to 49 vote in the Senate, Majority Leader John Thune made a motion to reconsider, setting up a possible vote on the matter within days. A source familiar with the matter told Cointelegraph Republicans who backed the bill were unlikely to modify it to block Trump or any member of his administration from investing in digital assets, claiming it was beyond Congress’s authority under the Constitution.“[...] this delay is not inherently detrimental,“ said Liat Shetret, vice president of global policy and regulation at blockchain analytics firm Elliptic. “We can expect the bill to return to the floor, with this pause giving both parties time to clarify provisions and address lawmakers’ concerns.”The Cedar Innovation Foundation, an organization tied to the political action committee (PAC) Fairshake, issued a warning to Senate leadership to “avoid political games” and pass a stablecoin bill “in the coming days.” Fairshake spent more than $131 million to support candidates in the 2024 US elections, some of whom are currently serving in the House and Senate. There are still more than 500 days until the 2026 midterms, when many members of Congress are up for reelection.On May 12, the Senate resumed consideration of the motion to proceed to consideration of the GENIUS Act, suggesting another vote soon.Related: US Treasury Secretary expresses support for crypto bills at hearingChanges to stablecoin or market structure bills?Should Republicans in the Senate reintroduce the bill without any changes, it’s unclear whether they would have enough support to clear a 60-vote majority to avoid a Democratic filibuster — a process to delay or sometimes block a vote on a bill. The Trump family’s ties to the crypto platform World Liberty Financial and its stablecoin, USD1, have raised potential corruption concerns, as has offering the top holders of his TRUMP memecoin the chance to pay for access to the president through an exclusive dinner and reception. “[...] the Republicans’ bill did nothing to address Trump’s conflict, and instead voted to hand Trump the authority to write the rules over his and his competitors’ stablecoins,” said Democratic Representative Maxine Waters in a May 6 statement. She blocked a hearing to discuss a possible digital asset market structure bill, citing concerns about Trump’s “ownership of crypto.”Democratic lawmakers have already introduced possible solutions to what they called the “biggest corruption scandal in the history of the White House” — with legislation in the House and Senate to bar members of Congress, the president, the vice president, and their families from profiting off memecoins.

2025-05-13T19:33:45.000Z,"Bitcoin is one rally away from new highs, but overly euphoric bulls signal ‘overheating’ market","Key takeaways:Bitcoin price maintains its bullish momentum, but a sentiment indicator suggests the market could be overheating. Data highlights Bitcoin traders taking profits and a lopsided market angled toward longs.Analysts warn of a potential short-term correction, especially if gold weakens or seasonal trends play out.Optimism has returned to the crypto markets, and many traders believe Bitcoin (BTC) price is on the path to new all-time highs. In just one month, Bitcoin surged 39%, briefly crossing the $105,000 mark. According to Glassnode analysts, “there are signs of renewed market strength, and the market is trading within a profit-dominated regime.”Still, not everyone is convinced the rally will continue unchecked. Some investors are already taking profits, pushing Bitcoin’s realized cap to an all-time high of $889 billion. Even more profit-taking is expected at the $106,000 level.Historically, euphoric market sentiment has often led to periods of consolidation—or even sharp corrections. That risk may be growing, particularly as gold, whose price action Bitcoin has closely mirrored in recent months, is showing signs of fatigue and could be heading for a correction itself.Most investors are back in profitThe recent Bitcoin rally has returned over 3 million BTC to a profitable state, according to Glassnode. This shift has reignited capital inflows, which exceeded $1 billion per day, suggesting strong demand-side interest and a market willing to absorb selling pressure. Even most short-term holders who were underwater since the December 2024 peak have seen their portfolios turn green.BTC short-term holders’ relative unrealized loss. Source: GlassnodeThis relief, both financial and psychological, is already translating into spending behavior. The net difference between short-term holders’ transfer volume in profit versus at a loss has swung sharply to +20%—a notable reversal from the -20% seen during the capitulation phase at the end of April.Institutional investor confidence is also rebounding. Over the past three weeks, more than $5.7 billion has flowed into Bitcoin ETFs, according to CoinGlass. The total assets under management held within the US spot ETFs have now climbed to over 1.26 million BTC, a new all-time high.Are crypto traders too euphoric right now?With so much momentum, it’s easy to imagine a moonshot. But that same momentum may be cause for caution. BTC’s open interest has climbed to $68 billion, near all-time highs, indicating a heavily positioned market. In such conditions, even a small catalyst could spark an outsized move—up or down.André Dragosch, head of research at Bitwise Asset Management, warned that Bitcoin might be getting a bit ahead of itself. He posted Bitwise’s in-house Cryptoasset Sentiment Index, which has reached its highest level since November 2024. The index, which includes 15 sub-indicators spanning sentiment, flows, onchain data, and derivatives (such as the perpetual funding rate and put-call volume ratio), now shows an overheated market.Bitcoin price vs Cryptoasset sentiment index. Source: BitwiseIn comments to Cointelegraph, Dragosch said,“The latest readings imply that market sentiment has become overheated and that positioning appears to be one-sided on the long side. It tends to signal an increased risk for a temporary pull-back in the price of Bitcoin, and that the current rally could take a break.”Yet, Dragosch remains “structurally constructive” until the end of 2025, citing the continued BTC accumulation by corporations and ETPs, which continues to deplete Bitcoin on-exchange balances.Related: Arizona governor kills two crypto bills, cracks down on Bitcoin ATMsPotential crypto market headwindsSeveral risks could challenge Bitcoin in the short term.For Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan, renewed regulatory uncertainty is a top concern, particularly after the Senate stalled stablecoin legislation last week.Broader shifts in market behavior may also be at play. Since March 2025, Bitcoin has shown a stronger correlation with gold than with equities. That shift followed dramatic changes in US policy, which appeared to steer capital toward politically neutral assets: both Bitcoin and gold rose 22% (the latter since corrected to a 13% gain). At the same time, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 merely clawed back earlier losses.BTC/USD vs gold, SPX, and NDX 1-day. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, TradingViewThis divergence continues on shorter time frames. Since May 12, major US indexes gained 3% to 4% on positive developments in US-China trade relations, but Bitcoin barely budged. Meanwhile, gold has started printing lower highs—a potential early signal of a downtrend, as noted by analyst Michael Van de Poppe. If gold enters a corrective phase, Bitcoin might follow suit.Seasonality may also play a role. The adage “Sell in May and go away” has some historical backing. As analyst Daan Crypto Trades noted, May has typically been a green month for Bitcoin (averaging over 8%), while June and September are often the worst-performing months. As he put it,“Seasonality is never something to solely base your decisions on, but it can work out well. Many investors are watching the same thing after all.”Whether this rally has more room to run—or is due for a breather—may soon be put to the test.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-13T15:29:38.000Z,"How to use tsUSDe on TON for yield-generating dollar savings","Looking for a way to earn passive income on your crypto without riding the rollercoaster of volatile coins? TsUSDe (the staked version) on The Open Network (TON) might be the answer. It’s a dollar-pegged stablecoin that earns yield by design, and you can boost those earnings even more by putting it to work on platforms like STON.fi and DeDust.Here’s how it works and how to get started in just a few steps.What is tsUSDe, and why use it?TsUSDe is a US dollar-backed stablecoin on the TON blockchain. It’s designed to earn a base yield of around 10% APY, paid out in Toncoin (TON). That means just holding it in your wallet earns you rewards — no extra steps needed.But if you want to go a step further, you can use tsUSDe in liquidity pools or farms on TON-based platforms to unlock even more yield. It’s like putting your dollars to work while still staying in stable territory.Where to earn yield with tsUSDeRight now, two of the most active platforms for tsUSDe yield farming on TON are:STON.fi — known for smooth UX and deep liquidityDeDust — fast, lightweight and gaining traction fast.Both let you pair tsUSDe with TON and stake your position to earn trading fees plus additional farming rewards.Did you know? STON.fi has a built-in impermanent loss calculator to help you gauge risk before adding liquidity, while DeDust offers a full portfolio dashboard to track tokens, LPs and rewards in one place.Step-by-step: How to earn yield with tsUSDe1. Connect your walletGo to STON.fi or DeDust.io, connect your TON wallet, and make sure you have some TON in your balance to cover transaction fees.2. Pick a tsUSDe liquidity poolHead to the “Pools” or “Farms” section and find a tsUSDe/TON pool. You’ll see estimated APY numbers, which vary depending on trading volume and incentives. On STON.fi, for example, this pool sometimes hits 30%+ APY.3. Add liquidityClick “Add Liquidity,” then enter the amount of tsUSDe you want to supply. You’ll also need to supply the same dollar value in TON. Once confirmed, you’ll get LP (liquidity provider) tokens showing your share of the pool.4. Stake to boost rewardsNow, stake those LP tokens to earn extra farming rewards. On STON.fi, look for the “Farm” button next to your position. On DeDust, use the “Boost” feature. Once staked, you’ll start earning even more TON on top of trading fees.5. Monitor and claim rewardsYou can check your rewards anytime and claim them whenever you want. You’re in full control; you can unstake or remove your liquidity whenever it suits you.What are the benefits of passive income with tsUSDe?Passive income with tsUSDe comes with unique advantages for users, including:Dollar stability: tsUSDe aims to stay pegged to $1, so your base savings aren’t volatile.Built-in APY: tsUSDe earns ~10% just sitting in your wallet.Extra rewards: Farming lets you boost returns even more through TON incentives.Non-custodial: You keep control of your assets the whole time.What about the risks of TON stablecoin yield?Earning yield with TON stablecoins comes with certain risks to be aware of, such as:Impermanent loss: If TON’s price changes significantly, your share of the pool may shift, reducing your value when you withdraw.Smart contract risk: As with any DeFi platform, there’s always a risk of bugs or exploits.Stablecoin peg risk: tsUSDe is designed to stay at $1, but extreme situations could cause a temporary depeg.Stick with well-known platforms and don’t invest more than you’re comfortable with.Did you know? TON supports TON Proxy, a decentralized anonymity protocol inspired by networks like Tor and I2P. TON Proxy allows users and nodes to obfuscate their identities and traffic.Earn APY with tsUSDe, but carefullyIf you’re already holding tsUSDe, putting it to work on TON is a no-brainer. You get a solid base yield, plus a chance to earn more through farming — all while keeping your savings in dollars. Whether you go with STON.fi or DeDust, the setup is quick, and the returns can add up fast.Start small, be aware of risks, monitor your rewards, and make your stablecoins work harder.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-13T15:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin remains unmatched as a global inflation hedge","Opinion by: Jupiter Zheng, Partner Liquid Fund at HashKey CapitalWhenever Bitcoin falls in value, the narrative is always the same: It’s failing as a hedge against inflation. In the eyes of critics, Bitcoin is not the “digital gold” that so many others claim it to be.With gold hitting all-time highs, these critics have grown louder. If Bitcoin is an inflation hedge, they ask, why isn’t it also rallying as investors seek safety?Even in today’s bearish, high-inflation environment, the cardinal truth holds: Bitcoin is an inflation hedge — arguably the most important one for long-term capital preservation the world has seen. Strength in scarcityBitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins, with full circulation expected by 2140. This built-in scarcity mirrors gold, which has historically served as an inflation hedge. Bitcoin has outperformed gold during multiple periods, such as the COVID-19 era, when global markets were flooded with liquidity.Like gold, Bitcoin works as an inflation hedge over the long term, not the short term. Critics focus too much on short-term volatility and ignore broader trends. Bitcoin has consistently been used as a store of value during extended periods of money printing.Bitcoin is not controlled by any central bank or politician. It’s a decentralized, peer-to-peer system governed by math and consensus — not by election cycles or political pressure. In places like Zimbabwe or Venezuela, where governments destroyed their currencies, Bitcoin has offered a more stable alternative. When faith in traditional systems weakens, Bitcoin often strengthens. Consensus beats centralizationBitcoin’s value isn’t just in its price — it’s in its design. Countries like the US, EU, UAE, Singapore, and Hong Kong have advanced regulations around Bitcoin, but its relevance goes far beyond developed economies.Inflation is an inconvenience in wealthier countries — rising grocery bills and pricier eggs. In struggling economies, inflation can signal political and financial collapse. Bitcoin offers a way out. It’s not theoretical anymore — it’s happening in real life.During Greece’s 2015 crisis, citizens used Bitcoin to bypass capital controls. In Venezuela and Argentina, where national currencies lost most of their value, Bitcoin became a tool for survival. People used it to preserve wealth, access global markets, and transact on decentralized exchanges.Recent: Bitcoin may rival gold as inflation hedge over next decade — Adam BackBitcoin’s borderless, censorship-resistant nature is critical. It doesn’t rely on the decisions of any one institution. It’s protected from debt monetization, interest rate manipulation, and geopolitical pressures. Bitcoin runs on consensus, not command. Consensus matters most when trust in institutions is low. This immutability is a characteristic that investors are undervaluing — and may not appreciate until they need it the most. Portability is powerBitcoin’s resilience also matters in developed markets — especially when traditional systems fail. Banks can collapse. Stock markets can crash. Payment processors can go offline. Bitcoin doesn’t sleep. It runs 24/7, 365 days a year.During the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in March 2023, Bitcoin jumped 23% as investors sought safety outside the traditional banking system. Bitcoin’s availability and independence became its advantage.In a bank failure like Lehman Brothers in 2008, consumers can lose access to their funds for months or even years. Bitcoin, held in self-custody, remains in your control — as long as you have the private keys. No third party is needed.Payment networks like Visa or SWIFT can also become chokepoints — and targets for hackers who want to disrupt the global payments infrastructure. Bitcoin isn’t subject to those bottlenecks. Miners, not banks, verify it. While congestion can slow transactions, scaling solutions are evolving to improve speed and cost.Bitcoin’s digital nature makes it especially valuable during capital controls, inflation, or crisis. It’s hard to seize, devalue, or freeze — giving individuals more autonomy than traditional financial systems allow.A more nuanced term: speculative hedge  Based on these characteristics, Bitcoin is unmistakably a hedge against inflation. Maybe we need a better term for Bitcoin’s central role in our financial futures.A more precise term might be speculative hedge — it offers long-term protection thanks to scarcity, consensus and decentralization. Yet, adoption and price volatility are still hurdles to Bitcoin dethroning gold as a true global inflation hedge. Still, there are encouraging signs. Companies like Strategy, GameStop, Block and MassMutual have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a treasury strategy — with some estimates pointing to one in four companies in the S&P 500 following suit by 2030. More governments are exploring Bitcoin reserves.As a speculative hedge, Bitcoin shines during inflation, currency devaluation, or systemic instability. It’s not a cure-all. Its effectiveness depends on user education, internet access, and geopolitical context. If connectivity disappears entirely — say, during a nuclear war — there will be bigger problems than inflation.Bitcoin is best understood as a financial lifeboat. It’s not perfect. It takes effort to use it correctly. It’s a small measure of preparation for life’s unknowns.

Source: The White HouseThe 90-day suspension of additional tariffs removes the risk of “sudden re-escalation,” which may help Bitcoin, altcoins and the wider stock market rally due to improved risk appetite, Nansen’s principal research analyst, Aurelie Barthere, told Cointelegraph.Related: Bitcoin ETFs, gov’t adoption to drive BTC to $1M by 2029: Finance RedefinedCorporate Bitcoin investment may lead to supply shockGrowing demand from institutional investors and corporations may lead to a diminishing Bitcoin supply on exchanges, signaling a potential price rally driven by a “supply shock,” which occurs when buyer demand meets decreasing available BTC, leading to price appreciation.While Bitcoin may experience short-term corrections, Dragosch remains “very bullish” for the rest of 2025, he told Cointelegraph during the Chain Reaction daily X show on May 12.“In 2025 alone, corporations have bought four times more Bitcoin than all US spot Bitcoin ETFs combined, which is crazy,” he said. “We’re close to 200,000 Bitcoin already, which is the annual supply of new Bitcoin.”Despite the bullish backdrop, Dragosch noted that the crypto market may still see short-term corrections due to what he described as overheated investor sentiment.

2025-05-13T14:04:14.000Z,"Bitcoin builders defend role of venture capital in layer-2 growth","Venture capital firms remain critical to infrastructure development in the Bitcoin ecosystem, despite pushback from some in the community, according to builders speaking at the Token2049 conference in Dubai.Charlie Yechuan Hu, CEO of Bitcoin layer-2 protocol Bitlayer, shared his insights on venture capital (VC) firms in the Bitcoin (BTC) ecosystem.Hu told Cointelegraph that he views many VC firms in the space positively, as they offer support to early ventures that need capital to build infrastructure.“You need developers, you need to open up the whole ecosystem foundation, everything,” Hu said. “You need to pay for the cloud, like AWS or RPCs, all that, servers […] So, we have to have VC on that.“Hu argued against the usual Bitcoiner ethos that argues against outsider capital, saying, “It’s difficult to say, okay, let’s do a fair mint, and then have a very successful, healthy treasury, and you have to pay all this stuff.”“It doesn’t work that way,” he said.Related: StarkWare researchers propose smart contracts for Bitcoin with ColliderVMLightning-only stance sparks debateNot everyone agrees. Mike Jarmuz, a managing partner at Bitcoin venture capital firm Lightning Ventures, told Cointelegraph that Lightning is the only L2 his company has invested in and is interested in. He said, “Anything with a ‘token’ that allows for ‘staking’ and earning some absurd APY interest on your Bitcoin should be avoided.”Jarmuz said that Lightning Network, on the other hand, is growing very quickly and makes Bitcoin transactions instant, nearly free and scalable. Bitcoin Visuals data shows that the Lightning Network has a cumulative capacity across all channels equivalent to almost $452 million at the time of writing. He added:“There is no ‘token’ when using the Lightning network. It’s Bitcoin. That to me is the only real L2, at least as of right now.“Lightning Network capacity chart. Source: Bitcoin VisualsJarmuz said that projects not meeting his criteria are “masquerading as useful” while doing nothing for Bitcoin. He claimed that sidechains like the Liquid Network and newer protocols such as e-cash and federations or Ark “are not widely used” but “are at least interesting.” He recognized that those “do not involve a staked token, promising yield,” with projects that have those features, “just waiting for rug pulls and issues.”“We don’t invest in that area,“ he added.Related: Spar supermarket in Switzerland starts accepting Bitcoin paymentsVCs seen as enablers of Bitcoin growthAccording to Hu, VCs bring liquidity, resources and experience to new startups while opening “up all the institutional ideas and connections.” He said that those were important additions to Bitlayer’s resources as well, noting that “we wouldn’t have that if those people didn’t invest in us.”He also argued that VCs tend to back long-term infrastructure efforts rather than speculative projects like memecoins or non-fungible tokens.  That experience was echoed by Walter Maffione, lead engineer at Lightning Network-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Kaleidoswap, who told Cointelegraph that the protocol started as an open-source project and raised a pre-seed investment from Fulgur Ventures and Bitfinex Ventures.“Those funds were used to pay open-source developers and accelerate protocol development, not to build a token or capture governance rights,“ he said.Hu claimed that VCs have contributed significantly to developing layer-2 scalability solutions, wallets, Bitcoin lending and staking protocols. He added:“All of them are VC-backed, including us. And some of them are listed on top exchanges.”Vikash Singh, principal at Bitcoin VC firm Stillmark, told Cointelegraph that when selecting Bitcoin layer-2 protocols to invest in, they consider demonstrated security and robustness, proliferation and adoption of non-speculative use cases and growth of the application layer. Much like Jarmuz, he said that Stillmark believes that proof-of-work is the superior consensus model.Still, unlike Jarmuz, Singh said proof-of-stake or Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus “may be suitable for Bitcoin sidechains and rollups.”Magazine: ‘Bitcoin layer 2s’ aren’t really L2s at all: Here’s why that matters",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-builders-defend-vc-role-layer-two-development?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
