The rally has pushed Ethereum’s market dominance (ETH.D) back toward the critical 10% threshold for the first time since March.But the rising dominance accompanies signs of overheating, indicating that Ethereum bulls should not celebrate its recent rally just yet.Ether’s RSI most overextended since May 2021The strong recovery in Ethereum’s crypto market share has pushed its daily relative strength index (RSI) to its most overbought zone since May 2021, raising red flags for traders betting on further upside, at least in the short term. Historically, such extreme RSI levels on ETH.D have marked the beginning of major pullbacks. One notable instance occurred in early July 2024, when ETH dominance peaked near similar RSI levels. ETH.D daily performance chart. Source: TradingView Over the following 315 days, ETH.D dropped by more than 17.5%. The current RSI spike, again above 80, mimics a similar setup, suggesting that Ethereum could be nearing a local top in its market share.Adding to the bearish outlook, ETH.D remains below its 200-day exponential moving average (200-day EMA; the blue wave). This resistance level has repeatedly capped Ethereum’s dominance during previous recovery attempts.Previous overbought pullbacks have initially pushed Ethereum’s market share toward its 50-day EMA (the red wave).The ETH.D metric, therefore, risks declining toward its current 50-day EMA support at around 8.24% by June, suggesting potential capital rotation out of Ethereum markets to other coins in the coming weeks.Bearish divergence signals 15% ETH price dropOn the four-hour ETH/USD chart, a classic bearish divergence is emerging, where Ethereum’s price continues to print higher highs, but momentum indicators trend lower. Crypto trader AlphaBTC noted that ETH is showing “three clear drives of divergence,” a setup often preceding trend exhaustion. He added that key Fibonacci levels align with potential support zones, suggesting a pullback could be imminent.ETH/USD four-hour price chart. Source: AlphaBTCWith ETH hovering near the $2,740 Fibonacci extension, profit-taking pressure may intensify, opening the door for a short-term correction toward lower Fib levels at around $2,330 or even $2,190, down 10-15% from the current prices.Independent market analyst Michaël van de Poppe suggests ETH’s decline in the coming weeks could serve as a “buy-the-dip opportunity,” indicating that the cryptocurrency would eventually climb over $3,500.

Kaggle is a Google-owned online platform for data science and machine learning competitions, learning and collaboration. Ramkumar Subramaniam, core contributor at crypto AI project OpenLedger, told Cointelegraph that “a front-page Kaggle ranking is a strong social signal, indicating that the data set is engaging the right communities of data scientists, machine learning engineers and practitioners.“Max Li, founder and CEO of OORT, told Cointelegraph that the firm “observed promising engagement metrics that validate the early demand and relevance” of its training data gathered through a decentralized model. He added:“The organic interest from the community, including active usage and contributions — demonstrates how decentralized, community-driven data pipelines like OORT’s can achieve rapid distribution and engagement without relying on centralized intermediaries.“Li also said that in the coming months, OORT plans to release multiple other data sets. Among those is an in-car voice commands data set, one for smart home voice commands and another one for deepfake videos meant to improve AI-powered media verification.Related: AI agents are coming for DeFi — Wallets are the weakest linkFirst page in multiple categoriesThe data set in question was independently verified by Cointelegraph to have reached the first page in Kaggle’s General AI, Retail & Shopping, Manufacturing, and Engineering categories earlier this month.

2025-05-14T11:39:41.000Z,"How to spot a fake crypto investment platform: 10 red flags","Key takeawaysFake crypto investment platforms give themselves away in a few obvious ways.Many use fake reviews, incorrect contact information and unrealistic promises to lure you in.The best approach is a healthy dose of skepticism. Watching for these red flags will keep you safe while investing.The burgeoning cryptocurrency market, with its lack of centralized authority and a constant flow of inexperienced users, makes digital assets a prime target for scammers. Fake crypto investment platforms are a common scam method, masquerading as useful services for crypto traders.Before signing up for any crypto investment platform, it’s essential to learn the telltale signs of a scam. This article will detail what to watch out for and how to verify if a crypto investment platform is legitimate. These tips will teach you how to avoid crypto scams. Did you know? The FTC hosts a crypto scam detection guide that allows you to view common crypto scams, sorted by company name, scam type and other keywords. How to spot a crypto scamHere are 10 crypto investment scam red flags to watch for when choosing a cryptocurrency investment platform.1. Promising unrealistic returnsWhat to watch for: Fake crypto investment platforms will try to entice you with unrealistic promises, like “Make 1 Bitcoin in just a few days!” A legitimate crypto exchange won’t need to sell you with fake deals.How to verify: The platform’s services should speak for themselves. None of them will give you a special advantage over the other, especially not one that can net you a Bitcoin just days after signing up. This is one of those prime crypto scam warning signs.2. Fake team membersWhat to watch for: It’s easy to make an “our team” page on any website, let alone one offering a decentralized service. At a minimum, these pages should include photos, descriptions and links to LinkedIn or other verified social media platforms.How to verify: Double-check team pages for legitimacy. Some scammers might also set up fake social media pages, so scan those for authentic interactions and delve deep into each team member’s project history.3. Inconsistent white paperWhat to watch for: Let’s be honest, most scammers won’t expect customers to read their project white paper. It’s probably something they threw together in ChatGPT or even plagiarized from a legitimate project.How to verify: Read a project’s white paper in-depth and watch for legitimate use cases. Make sure the project solves a real problem, has a legitimate purpose and a realistic plan for the future. Don’t fall for buzzwords!Did you know? Justin Sun, founder of Tron’s long-standing blockchain platform, has been accused of plagiarizing Ethereum’s white paper.4. False endorsementsWhat to watch for: Just as it’s super easy to fabricate an “our team” page, scammers can place fake endorsements all over their home page. It’s as quick as copying and pasting a company logo like Forbes.How to verify: Instead of trusting an exchange’s webpage, look up news releases and other proof of these supposed endorsements. Cointelegraph provides a directory of legit exchanges to help you identify fake crypto websites.5. Lack of regulatory informationWhat to watch for: Now, regulatory requirements may vary depending on whether you’re looking at a centralized or decentralized platform, but if you’re looking at the former, know that centralized platforms cannot operate without regulatory approval from your government.How to verify: Typically, you can check a government database to confirm if a platform is licensed. If it’s not, it may not be trustworthy. For example, the CEO of Tether (USDT) refuses to comply with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. The company is known for its resistance to comply with regulatory policies, causing industry-wide suspicion.6. Pushy sales tacticsWhat to watch for: Pushy sales tactics are a big red flag. If a platform reaches out to you through social media, such as through a direct message on X, Discord or Telegram, you can be sure it’s a scam. Scammers might claim to be an employee or crypto influencer ready to provide you with an “exclusive offer” or “limited time deal.” How to verify: A real exchange would never reach out to potential customers like this, especially via social media. Social media DMs are widespread crypto scam tactics.Did you know? Some top crypto scams in 2024 were phishing attacks, rug pulls and fake airdrops. 7. Fake location/contact infoWhat to watch for: Crypto investment platforms with a real product, even decentralized ones, will have contact information. Even Uniswap has a support email with which to get in touch. Centralized entities should also have addresses of their offices, ones that you can cross-reference with Google Maps for legitimacy purposes. How to verify: If a crypto investment platform is missing any contact information, consider that a red flag. This is an easy sign to miss.8. Fake reviewsWhat to watch for: Tech products, blockchain-based and otherwise, feature user reviews front and center on their websites. That said, you can tell if these are real or manufactured. Keep an eye out for reviews with repetitive language and a lack of a critical eye, which only praise the platform. Glowing reviews are often fake, possibly even written by AI.How to verify: Search for platform reviews on Reddit and other social media sites. Other users will tell you if the platform is legit or not. If a platform has no social media accounts, there is more reason to avoid it.9. Fake airdrops or giveawaysWhat to watch for: Some fraudulent platforms may offer airdrops or giveaways as promotions to attract positive attention. However, participating in the fake airdrop might require inputting a wallet seed phrase or private key. How to verify: Legitimate airdrops will be announced on social media platforms like X, the platform’s blog on Medium or its official website. They’ll only ask for your wallet address, nothing more.3. No fiat offrampingWhat to watch for: A crypto exchange with no fiat offramping means it’s not registered with local financial institutions. The platform might demand that you only work in crypto.How to verify: If you sign up for an exchange and it immediately asks you to send crypto into your wallet on the platform instead of linking a payment method like a bank or card, this is a big red flag.Cryptocurrency investment scams thrive on urging you to make rash decisions. It’s always best to be skeptical when choosing where to trade, invest or hold your crypto. Take your time, do your research, and double-check every piece of information a platform provides. These crypto fraud prevention tips will help keep you safe, protecting your assets and peace of mind. Use them to create a crypto scam checklist.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-spot-a-fake-crypto-investment-platform-10-red-flags?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-14T07:50:00.000Z,"The Q-Day Prize challenge, explained: Can quantum computers really break Bitcoin?","What is the Q-Day prize?              The Q-Day Prize is a challenge to make the Bitcoin network quantum resistant.On April 16, 2025, quantum computing-focused company Project 11 announced the “Q-Day Prize,” a competition to break a “toy version” of Bitcoin’s cryptography with a quantum computer. Contestants must complete the Q-Day Prize challenge by April 5, 2026.Their reward? 1 Bitcoin (BTC).The “Q” in Q-Day refers to quantum computing, the potential threat to many existing cryptographic security measures. But can quantum computers break Bitcoin? Let’s find out.Quantum computing and the threat to BitcoinBitcoin utilizes the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, a National Security Agency (NSA)-developed encryption algorithm. SHA-256 prevents brute force attacks against the Bitcoin network, as decrypting it with current hardware can take decades. However, the emerging threat to SHA-256 is quantum computing, a method of computing that harnesses quantum physics and is much faster than traditional computing.At a fundamental level, quantum computing utilizes quantum bits (qubits), which can exist in multiple states. This contradicts binary (traditional) computing, which uses binary bits (1s and 0s). In 1994, mathematician Peter Shor presented an algorithm for quantum computers to solve complex algorithms in seconds, rather than the decades it can take for conventional hardware. At the time, no hardware could effectively run it, but recent advances like Google Willow are nearing that capability.Quantum computing, when paired with Shor’s algorithm, can disrupt Bitcoin cryptographic systems as we know them. Shor’s algorithm allows quantum computers to solve complex math super fast, potentially threatening Bitcoin’s safety.Did you know? If quantum tech gets strong enough, Bitcoin’s current security could become obsolete, so developers are racing to create “quantum-proof” shields using new math that even Shor’s algorithm can’t break.                  Quantum threat to Bitcoin: How real is the danger?              Bitcoin is vulnerable to quantum computing, but how serious is the risk?When you create a crypto wallet, it generates two important things: a private key and a public key. The private key is a secret code, like a password, that you must keep safe. The public key is created from your private key, and your wallet address (like a bank account number) is made from the public key.You share your wallet address with others so they can send you cryptocurrency, just like you share your email address for someone to contact you. However, you never share your private key. It’s like the password to your email — only you need it to access and spend the money in your wallet.Your private key is like a master password that controls your crypto wallet. From this private key, your wallet can create many public keys, and each public key generates a wallet address. For example, if you use a hardware wallet, it has one private key but can create unlimited public keys (wallet addresses). This means you can have different addresses for each cryptocurrency supported by the wallet or even multiple addresses for the same cryptocurrency, all managed by a single private key.While generating a public key from a private key is straightforward, figuring out a private key from a public key is extremely hard — almost impossible — which keeps your wallet secure. Every time you send cryptocurrency, your private key creates a special code called a signature. This signature proves you own the funds and want to send them. The system that uses your private key, public key and signature to secure transactions is called the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).It is believed that quantum computing could reverse the process and generate private keys out of public ones. It is feared that this could cause many Bitcoin holders (especially whales and Satoshi-era wallets) to lose their funds. Bitcoin address types and quantum risksWhen you send Bitcoin, you use a specific address type to direct the payment. Each address type has unique features, affecting security, privacy and vulnerability to quantum computing attacks like Shor’s algorithm.P2PK address typesWhen you pay someone with Bitcoin, the transaction is typically considered a “pay-to-public-key” (P2PK). This was the most common payment method in 2009, according to a report from consulting firm Deloitte. Much of the original Bitcoin released at the network’s launch is held in wallets with the P2PK address type, primarily due to the fact that they’ve sent transactions since Bitcoin’s 2009 launch. These addresses are long (up to 130 characters), making them less user-friendly.Wallets with the P2PK address type are most susceptible to Shor’s algorithm, as it can brute force the private key from a P2PK wallet address. P2PKH address typesThere’s a second address type that’s more resistant to Shor’s algorithm: the pay-to-public-key-hash (P2PKH). P2PKH addresses are shorter and are generated from the hash (a unique, hexadecimal value) of a public key created using SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 algorithms instead of displaying the full key itself.These addresses are shorter (33-34 characters), start with “1,” and are encoded in Base58 format. Such addresses are widely used and include a checksum to prevent typos, making them more reliable.P2PKH addresses are more resistant to Shor’s algorithm than P2PK because the public key is hashed. The public key is only revealed when you spend from the address (not when receiving). If a P2PKH address never sends Bitcoin, its public key stays hidden, offering better protection against quantum attacks. However, reusing a P2PKH address (sending from it multiple times) exposes the public key, increasing vulnerability. Also, when you spend from a P2PKH address, the public key becomes visible on the blockchain, making transactions trackable.Taproot addressesTaproot is the newest address type, introduced in November 2021 via the Taproot soft fork. It uses Schnorr signatures instead of the ECDSA signatures used by P2PK and P2PKH. These addresses start with “bc1p,” use Bech32m encoding, and are 62 characters long.They offer better privacy. Multisignature (multisig) transactions look like single-signature ones, hiding complex spending conditions. However, Taproot addresses expose the public key (or a tweaked version), making them vulnerable to Shor’s algorithm, similar to P2PK. Did you know? Google’s “Willow” computer chip is capable of solving a complex problem in just five minutes. The same task would take a classical supercomputer 10 septillion (!) years.                  The race toward quantum-proofing Bitcoin              Quantum resistance is a real challenge, but not an impossible one.Quantum computers, still in early development, could one day use Shor’s algorithm to break Bitcoin’s cryptography by deriving private keys from public keys. This would threaten Bitcoin and other systems using SHA-256 or ECDSA (the algorithms securing Bitcoin transactions). However, this threat is not imminent, and solutions are already in progress.While some believe that Project 11 presented the Q-Day Prize to take down Bitcoin, the company claims this initiative is aimed at “quantum-proofing” the network.In July 2022, the US Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced four quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms resulting from a six-year challenge to develop such solutions.Quantum computing won’t develop in isolation, and centralized systems like government and financial networks could be bigger targets than Bitcoin’s decentralized blockchain. These systems use outdated cryptography, like RSA, vulnerable to Shor’s algorithm, and store sensitive data (e.g., banking records). Their single points of failure make breaches easier than attacking Bitcoin’s distributed nodes. The International Monetary Fund warns quantum computers could disrupt mobile banking, while Dr. Michele Mosca from the Institute for Quantum Computing highlights “harvest-now, decrypt-later” risks for centralized data (where attackers store encrypted data today to decrypt with future quantum computers). In 2024, the G7 Cyber Expert Group urged financial institutions to assess quantum risks, noting that centralized systems’ data could be exposed if intercepted now and decrypted later.Did you know? Many blockchain networks are exploring quantum-resistant algorithms, such as Quantum Resistant Ledger or Algorand. These quantum computing blockchain security methods present a few different approaches.                  How to increase your security against quantum threats              While the quantum computing cryptocurrency risk is less of a threat than one might think, it’s still best to stay prepared.Still, if you’re worried about Bitcoin quantum vulnerability, there are a few precautions you can take to secure your crypto finances.Avoid reusing public addresses: Most crypto wallets allow you to generate a new public address for every transaction. This practice will make it much harder to track your spending habits.Move funds to a private wallet: If you’ve been using the same public wallet address for some time, consider moving your funds to a new wallet with no history. This will help keep your spending habits private. Use a different blockchain network: Legacy networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum are considered less quantum resistant than newer networks with more modern security algorithms. Consider alternative networks with quantum resistance in mind.Stay informed: Pay attention to the results of the Q-Day Prize challenge, and stay up to date with quantum computing news so you can react accordingly. The best defense is an informed one.While quantum risk is not immediate, developers and cybersecurity experts are actively working on solutions to ensure long-term security. In the meantime, users should stay updated about Bitcoin protocol updates and best practices, such as avoiding address reuse, as the network gradually moves toward quantum resistance.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/the-q-day-prize-challenge-explained-can-quantum-computers-really-break-bitcoin?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Kima CEO Eitan Katz said the integration shows that stablecoins can be practical for everyday use and remove friction and intermediaries from crypto-to-fiat conversions while expanding crypto usability.“Our goal at Kima is to eliminate barriers between digital assets and traditional finance,” Katz said.Related: Mastercard tokenized 30% of its transactions in 2024Infrastructure designed for interoperabilityKatz described Kima’s settlement system as asset-agnostic and designed to simplify cross-ecosystem payments, supporting public blockchains, private ledgers and traditional banking rails:“Kima’s asset-agnostic settlement layer is designed to abstract the complexity of transferring value across disparate ecosystems, whether that’s public blockchains, private ledgers, or even traditional banking systems.”According to the announcement, Kima’s infrastructure is aligned with Mastercard’s aim to bring stablecoins into mainstream financial usage. Katz rejects the Bitcoin and crypto hardliner vision of digital assets being contrapposed to fiat currency, claiming that “crypto and fiat must coexist seamlessly to reach their full potential.”Katz explained that Kima’s solution allows for easy crosschain interoperability and eliminates the reliance on intermediaries, custodians or complex smart contracts.

Katz added that “once a user is cleared, every transaction carries immutable metadata tags that our protocol-level engine checks against local rules.” This, he said, covers compliance “from the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation to Singapore’s regulatory guidelines — before settlement.”Katz said that “keys are kept entirely under the users’ control,” while cryptographic proofs still allow for compliance.“Institutions get a plug-and-play control layer and users enjoy true self-custody,” Katz added.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/kima-integrates-with-mastercard-sandbox-to-enable-stablecoin-card-top-ups?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-14T07:11:44.000Z,"Alarm bells ring in US over OpenAI’s crypto project World","World Network, the digital identity and crypto project of Sam Altman’s OpenAI, has alarmed privacy activists ahead of its United States launch, with observers concerned over its data collection and protection practices.World “is the opposite of privacy. It’s a trap,” said Nick Almond, CEO of FactoryDAO, on X. While the project claims to protect user privacy in the age of proliferating AI, it’s faced a slew of regulatory concerns across the globe.Formerly known as “Worldcoin,” the iris-scanning technology and its crypto token payout scheme are being probed by authorities in India, South Korea, Italy, Colombia, Argentina, Portugal, Kenya and Indonesia. In Spain, Hong Kong and Brazil, it’s outright banned.World’s latest foray into the US could prove to be CEO Sam Altman’s biggest challenge yet, where privacy concerns are heightened by a patchwork of enforcement that differs state by state.Varying privacy laws could leave World users open to discriminationOn April 30, Altman announced that World would set up in “key innovation hubs” in five states in the US: Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville and San Francisco. Would-be verified humans can scan their irises at these hubs, giving World unique biomedical markers. These markers, per World, can be used to prove one’s humanness when interacting with others on digital platforms. But as World expands into the US, an uncertain regulatory landscape could put people off and make it difficult for the platform to build user trust. Andrew Rossow, a cyber and public affairs attorney at Rossow Law, told Cointelegraph, “There is no comprehensive federal law specifically regulating biometric data (such as iris scans) in the US.”Indeed, laws differ state by state. Two states in which World will operate, Texas and California, have some form of legal protections on the books for biometric data. Users in the remaining three states, Georgia, Tennessee and Florida, must rely on federal law, which requires that “companies must be transparent and fair, but there are no special state rules for iris scans.”But even the existence of state law is no guarantee of protection. In Texas, there is no private right of action for biometric data — only the state attorney general (AG) can enforce the state’s Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier law. Altman announced World’s foray into the US market at a company event two weeks ago. Source: World“The effectiveness of user data protections, as it pertains to World, hinges almost entirely on the Texas AG’s priorities, resources and willingness to act,” said Rossow. A more aggressive AG could mean more robust protections, while “a less aggressive administration could deprioritize enforcement, which leaves consumers open and vulnerable to exploitation.”The potential for exploitation is one of the key factors driving activist efforts against systems like World. Privacy International, a privacy protection group that supported legal action in Kenya against World, states that in “the absence of strong legal frameworks and strict safeguards, biometric technologies pose grave threats to privacy and personal security, as their application can be broadened to facilitate discrimination, profiling and mass surveillance.”Related: Over 70 crypto firms join forces to tackle Big Tech’s AI monopolyAs far back as 2021, Amnesty International had raised concerns over discrimination and biometric systems’ applications of dubious methodologies. Such systems, they said, can “make inferences and predictions about things such as people’s gender, emotions, or other personal attributes, suffer from serious, fundamental flaws in their scientific underpinnings.”“This means that the inferences they make about us are often invalid, in some cases even operationalizing eugenicist theories of phrenology and physiognomy.”Not everyone is convinced of privacy watchdogs’ concerns. Tomasz Stańczak, co-executive director at the Ethereum Foundation, said that he has spent “over 100 hours” analyzing World, which is building on the Ethereum network. He added that it “looked very promising and much more robust and privacy-focused than my initial intuition.”Paul Dylan-Ennis, an Ethereum researcher and academic, said that he believes World’s tech “is likely strong in privacy terms” but admitted that the aesthetic could be putting people off: “Just some intangible Black Mirror-ness to it all.”Worldcoin faces mounting bans worldwideOpenAI may be doubling down on an American strategy, but other jurisdictions around the world are increasingly investigating, limiting or outright banning the firm’s activities. In 2023, regulators in India, South Korea, Kenya, Germany and Brazil began investigating the firm’s data collection practices. Spain became the first country to ban World data collection outright in March 2024. Related: North Korean spy slips up, reveals ties in fake job interviewThe Spanish Data Protection Agency previously told Cointelegraph that its course of action was based on reports from Spanish citizens.

2025-05-14T07:09:58.000Z,"Crypto VC deals drop in Q1, but funding more than doubles: PitchBook","Crypto venture capital deals in the first quarter of 2025 saw deal values jump even as the number of deals sank from the same quarter a year ago, says PitchBook.The venture research firm said in its May 14 Crypto VC Trends report for Q1 that 405 deals were made in the quarter, down 39.5% from the 670 deals made in Q1 2024, but slightly up from the 372 made in Q4 last year.However, the total value of deals in Q1 more than doubled from a year ago, jumping to $6 billion compared to $2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2024 and doubling from $3 billion in Q4 2024.PitchBook's senior crypto research analyst Robert Le said that despite macroeconomic turmoil over the quarter, “capital continued to seek crypto’s core utility rails.”VCs poured nearly $2.55 billion across 16 deals into businesses like crypto asset managers, exchanges, and financial services at a rate that far surpassed any other segment.Crypto infrastructure and development firms saw the next largest venture funding, fetching nearly $955 million across 30 deals.Web3-focused companies saw the third-most deals and funding, at 23 and $231.2 million, respectively. Source: PitchBook.Looking ahead, PitchBook’s Le said Circle’s pending initial public offering (IPO) “represents the most important price-discovery event for crypto equity since Coinbase listed in 2021.”If Circle is valued above the rumored $4 billion to $5 billion range, it could show venture investors that business models similar to Circle’s are profitable and sustainable while also providing a clearer benchmark for future exits.“A strong roadshow could therefore crowd in new late-stage capital and reset valuation expectations upward across the payments and infrastructure stack.”Circle has raised $1.18 billion in VC funding to date, according to PitchBook, which estimates a 64% chance that it will go public in the future.“Dollar-denominated settlement remains crypto’s killer application”Le noted that the market value of stablecoins grew 12% over the first quarter, from $202.3 billion to $227.1 billion, even as other cryptocurrencies saw their values fall or stagnate.“In our view, this divergence underscores a growing consensus: Dollar-denominated settlement remains crypto’s killer application, insulated—at least partially— from broader risk-off moves.”Le said PitchBook expected that near-term venture investments could increase, “especially in payment, remittance, and treasury-management startups that directly monetize stablecoin velocity.”Related: Bitcoin builders defend venture capital's role in layer-2 growthLe added that the $1.4 billion Bybit exploit in February — the largest in crypto history — may accelerate institutional demand for real-time proof-of-reserve tooling, improved custody solutions and middleware that simplifies key management.“Startups addressing those vectors should find a more receptive funding environment despite the broader valuation reset,” he added.Notable crypto venture-backed or growth-stage companies that received investment in Q4 2024.

2025-05-14T07:07:14.000Z,"Crypto swapper eXch shows signs of life after post-Bybit shutdown","Once a go-to swapper for hackers and drainers, eXch was shut down by German police in April — but continued activity suggests the story isn’t over.Without Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, eXch wasn’t your typical crypto exchange. It acted more like an instant swapper, allowing bad actors and cybercriminals to fly under the radar for years.Among its clients was the Lazarus Group. The North Korean state-backed hacking unit thrust eXch into the spotlight back in February, when it used the platform to funnel some of the $1.4 billion it stole from Bybit. When Bybit traced its stolen funds to eXch, it requested assistance — but the platform refused.This led to a fierce discussion over privacy versus security, but ultimately, eXch announced it would close its doors on April 17; on April 30, German authorities made it official.But according to security firm TRM Labs, the platform may have continued operating in stealth mode after the takedown. Here’s the rise, fall and afterlife of alleged crypto laundromat eXch.eXch shuts front door, keeps back door unlockedAlongside its shutdown announcement, eXch posted a message claiming it would not facilitate criminal proceeds. The post was removed within hours, and operations quietly resumed — signs of an internal disagreement or perhaps even a calculated attempt to lower visibility, according to TRM.CSAM-related fund flows traced to eXch. Source: TRM LabsGerman authorities seized eXch’s servers and confiscated 34 million euros ($38 million) in crypto, along with more than eight terabytes of data, effectively dismantling its public-facing infrastructure.Related: North Korean spy slips up, reveals ties in fake job interview“Just like we saw with Garantex rebranding as Grinex, eXch didn’t fully die after the shutdown. It quietly kept servicing a handful of partners via API, which meant laundering activity continued even after the public takedown,” said Jeremiah O’Connor, co-founder and chief technology officer of security firm Trugard.O’Connor added that it’s not unlikely for such platforms to serve loyal customers even after seizures.EXch website visited on May 13. Source: eXch“The people behind eXch.ch took full advantage of operating across multiple countries. The domain was registered through a UK-based provider, listed Switzerland as an admin location, hosted infrastructure in France, and had servers seized in Germany,” O’Connor said.It’s still unclear if eXch will kill its API or come back under a new name. TRM said in the May 2 blog post that the platform’s remaining back-end access continued to provide anonymization infrastructure for threat actors.No KYC, pooled liquidity draws illicit funds to eXchEXch’s origins trace back to 2014, according to “Fantasy,” lead investigator at crypto insurance firm Fairside Network. In an October 2024 investigation, Fantasy identified the platform’s first public appearance as a BitcoinTalk forum account promoting automatic swaps between Bitcoin (BTC), Perfect Money and BTC-e vouchers — payment methods commonly associated with high-risk transactions. Fantasy also traced the original Bitcoin wallet tied to eXch and found it was likely funded via BTC-e, the now-defunct crypto exchange shuttered by US authorities in 2017 for its role in laundering criminal proceeds.Fantasy’s forensic research found that the modernized form of eXch emerged in 2022, when its Ethereum hot wallet was first funded. Not long after, it became a hub for prominent crypto drainers.Monkey Drainer — the first known large-scale drainer-as-a-service operator — used eXch before its retirement. Other draining service providers like Pink Drainer and Inferno Drainer also passed funds through the platform, along with several major exploiters.EXch’s modern wallets traced to accounts held at Binance and OKX. Source: Fantasy/MetaSleuthEXch required no identity verification, allowing users to move funds with anonymity. That made it an attractive tool for cybercriminals looking to clean stolen assets.“EXch managed to stay active for years — despite facilitating obvious illicit activity — because there’s still a big gap between what regulators ‘can’ do and how fast technology is moving,” Amit Levin, former investigator at Binance, told Cointelegraph.“In today’s world, anyone can launch a smart contract or run a crypto service from anywhere, often without revealing who they are. And if there’s no registration, no KYC and no one to hold accountable, enforcement becomes close to impossible.”The platform also drew confidence from threat actors by using a pooled liquidity system that blended user deposits and withdrawals, making it difficult for investigators and law enforcement to trace the flow of funds.When eXch knew and did nothingEXch denied laundering funds for North Korean crypto hackers, and in its shutdown notice, it framed the project as an attempt by privacy enthusiasts to “restore balance” in the industry. It criticized Anti-Money Laundering enforcement and condemned companies offering address risk scoring APIs as “parasites” profiting off government fear.“Service providers in the crypto space are, for the most part, not decentralized; that is, they retain control over or access to customers’ assets, as demonstrated in the case of eXch,” Gal Arad Cohen, partner at S. Horowitz & Co, told Cointelegraph.“A financial intermediary operating in the crypto sector faces risks similar to those of traditional financial service providers and should, therefore, be held to equivalent standards and regulatory requirements,” she said.The closure of eXch is a “huge win” for crypto, according to Alex Katz, CEO of security firm Kerberus. However, Katz warned that bad actors can migrate to alternative projects, like THORChain, which received a shoutout in eXch’s unapologetic farewell manifesto.In the Bybit hack, decentralized swap protocol THORChain was used as the main bridge to swap around 500,000 Ether (ETH) to Bitcoin.EXch operators also used THORChain to allegedly obfuscate trails. Source: Tanuki42EXch stated that its partners would retain access to its API for a limited time, but future operations would depend on the “new management team.” The old team recommended setting up new liquidity pools to maintain seamless functionality and said it would provide consultations.It signed off with a defiant message: “Privacy is not a crime.”German authorities reported that $1.9 billion in crypto flowed into eXch since its inception. Its operators are suspected of commercial money laundering and running a criminal trading platform.Magazine: ChatGPT a ‘schizophrenia-seeking missile,’ AI scientists prep for 50% deaths: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-exch-signs-life-bybit-shutdown?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

This decline follows a US-China trade deal on May 12, which introduced a 90-day tariff pause and a 115% reduction on both sides.CBOE Volatility Index chart. Source: X.comThe agreement has fueled a \""risk-on\"" sentiment, boosting Bitcoin and equities as investors lean into higher-risk assets, according to Bitcoin network economist Timothy Peterson. The analyst said, “$VIX dropped substantially yesterday on news of a potential China trade deal. It is now at 'normal' levels. This will be a 'risk on' environment for the foreseeable future.”Adding to the bullish sentiment, the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate dropped to 2.3% year-over-year in April 2025, the lowest since February 2021, down from 2.4% in March and below consensus forecasts of 2.4%.

Immediately following the vote, some lawmakers from both parties suggested they could reconsider the bill as early as this week, but without agreeing on a bipartisan path forward.After the GENIUS Act failed to proceed in a 48 to 49 vote in the Senate, Majority Leader John Thune made a motion to reconsider, setting up a possible vote on the matter within days. A source familiar with the matter told Cointelegraph Republicans who backed the bill were unlikely to modify it to block Trump or any member of his administration from investing in digital assets, claiming it was beyond Congress’s authority under the Constitution.“[...] this delay is not inherently detrimental,“ said Liat Shetret, vice president of global policy and regulation at blockchain analytics firm Elliptic. “We can expect the bill to return to the floor, with this pause giving both parties time to clarify provisions and address lawmakers’ concerns.”The Cedar Innovation Foundation, an organization tied to the political action committee (PAC) Fairshake, issued a warning to Senate leadership to “avoid political games” and pass a stablecoin bill “in the coming days.” Fairshake spent more than $131 million to support candidates in the 2024 US elections, some of whom are currently serving in the House and Senate. There are still more than 500 days until the 2026 midterms, when many members of Congress are up for reelection.On May 12, the Senate resumed consideration of the motion to proceed to consideration of the GENIUS Act, suggesting another vote soon.Related: US Treasury Secretary expresses support for crypto bills at hearingChanges to stablecoin or market structure bills?Should Republicans in the Senate reintroduce the bill without any changes, it’s unclear whether they would have enough support to clear a 60-vote majority to avoid a Democratic filibuster — a process to delay or sometimes block a vote on a bill. The Trump family’s ties to the crypto platform World Liberty Financial and its stablecoin, USD1, have raised potential corruption concerns, as has offering the top holders of his TRUMP memecoin the chance to pay for access to the president through an exclusive dinner and reception. “[...] the Republicans’ bill did nothing to address Trump’s conflict, and instead voted to hand Trump the authority to write the rules over his and his competitors’ stablecoins,” said Democratic Representative Maxine Waters in a May 6 statement. She blocked a hearing to discuss a possible digital asset market structure bill, citing concerns about Trump’s “ownership of crypto.”Democratic lawmakers have already introduced possible solutions to what they called the “biggest corruption scandal in the history of the White House” — with legislation in the House and Senate to bar members of Congress, the president, the vice president, and their families from profiting off memecoins. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Chris Van Hollen also reportedly called on the president to fully divest from USD1 before making any possible deals with foreign governments.The nonpartisan organization State Democracy Defenders Action reported in April that Trump’s crypto holdings were worth roughly $2.9 billion, which accounted for 40% of his wealth. This report came before the launch of World Liberty Financial’s stablecoin, which an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm said it would use to settle a $2 billion investment in Binance.

2025-05-13T19:33:45.000Z,"Bitcoin is one rally away from new highs, but overly euphoric bulls signal ‘overheating’ market","Key takeaways:Bitcoin price maintains its bullish momentum, but a sentiment indicator suggests the market could be overheating. Data highlights Bitcoin traders taking profits and a lopsided market angled toward longs.Analysts warn of a potential short-term correction, especially if gold weakens or seasonal trends play out.Optimism has returned to the crypto markets, and many traders believe Bitcoin (BTC) price is on the path to new all-time highs. In just one month, Bitcoin surged 39%, briefly crossing the $105,000 mark. According to Glassnode analysts, “there are signs of renewed market strength, and the market is trading within a profit-dominated regime.”Still, not everyone is convinced the rally will continue unchecked. Some investors are already taking profits, pushing Bitcoin’s realized cap to an all-time high of $889 billion. Even more profit-taking is expected at the $106,000 level.Historically, euphoric market sentiment has often led to periods of consolidation—or even sharp corrections. That risk may be growing, particularly as gold, whose price action Bitcoin has closely mirrored in recent months, is showing signs of fatigue and could be heading for a correction itself.Most investors are back in profitThe recent Bitcoin rally has returned over 3 million BTC to a profitable state, according to Glassnode. This shift has reignited capital inflows, which exceeded $1 billion per day, suggesting strong demand-side interest and a market willing to absorb selling pressure. Even most short-term holders who were underwater since the December 2024 peak have seen their portfolios turn green.BTC short-term holders’ relative unrealized loss. Source: GlassnodeThis relief, both financial and psychological, is already translating into spending behavior. The net difference between short-term holders’ transfer volume in profit versus at a loss has swung sharply to +20%—a notable reversal from the -20% seen during the capitulation phase at the end of April.Institutional investor confidence is also rebounding. Over the past three weeks, more than $5.7 billion has flowed into Bitcoin ETFs, according to CoinGlass. The total assets under management held within the US spot ETFs have now climbed to over 1.26 million BTC, a new all-time high.Are crypto traders too euphoric right now?With so much momentum, it’s easy to imagine a moonshot. But that same momentum may be cause for caution. BTC’s open interest has climbed to $68 billion, near all-time highs, indicating a heavily positioned market. In such conditions, even a small catalyst could spark an outsized move—up or down.André Dragosch, head of research at Bitwise Asset Management, warned that Bitcoin might be getting a bit ahead of itself. He posted Bitwise’s in-house Cryptoasset Sentiment Index, which has reached its highest level since November 2024. The index, which includes 15 sub-indicators spanning sentiment, flows, onchain data, and derivatives (such as the perpetual funding rate and put-call volume ratio), now shows an overheated market.Bitcoin price vs Cryptoasset sentiment index. Source: BitwiseIn comments to Cointelegraph, Dragosch said,“The latest readings imply that market sentiment has become overheated and that positioning appears to be one-sided on the long side. It tends to signal an increased risk for a temporary pull-back in the price of Bitcoin, and that the current rally could take a break.”Yet, Dragosch remains “structurally constructive” until the end of 2025, citing the continued BTC accumulation by corporations and ETPs, which continues to deplete Bitcoin on-exchange balances.Related: Arizona governor kills two crypto bills, cracks down on Bitcoin ATMsPotential crypto market headwindsSeveral risks could challenge Bitcoin in the short term.For Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan, renewed regulatory uncertainty is a top concern, particularly after the Senate stalled stablecoin legislation last week.Broader shifts in market behavior may also be at play. Since March 2025, Bitcoin has shown a stronger correlation with gold than with equities. That shift followed dramatic changes in US policy, which appeared to steer capital toward politically neutral assets: both Bitcoin and gold rose 22% (the latter since corrected to a 13% gain). At the same time, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 merely clawed back earlier losses.BTC/USD vs gold, SPX, and NDX 1-day. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, TradingViewThis divergence continues on shorter time frames. Since May 12, major US indexes gained 3% to 4% on positive developments in US-China trade relations, but Bitcoin barely budged. Meanwhile, gold has started printing lower highs—a potential early signal of a downtrend, as noted by analyst Michael Van de Poppe. If gold enters a corrective phase, Bitcoin might follow suit.Seasonality may also play a role. The adage “Sell in May and go away” has some historical backing. As analyst Daan Crypto Trades noted, May has typically been a green month for Bitcoin (averaging over 8%), while June and September are often the worst-performing months. As he put it,“Seasonality is never something to solely base your decisions on, but it can work out well. Many investors are watching the same thing after all.”Whether this rally has more room to run—or is due for a breather—may soon be put to the test.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-13T15:29:38.000Z,"How to use tsUSDe on TON for yield-generating dollar savings","Looking for a way to earn passive income on your crypto without riding the rollercoaster of volatile coins? TsUSDe (the staked version) on The Open Network (TON) might be the answer. It’s a dollar-pegged stablecoin that earns yield by design, and you can boost those earnings even more by putting it to work on platforms like STON.fi and DeDust.Here’s how it works and how to get started in just a few steps.What is tsUSDe, and why use it?TsUSDe is a US dollar-backed stablecoin on the TON blockchain. It’s designed to earn a base yield of around 10% APY, paid out in Toncoin (TON). That means just holding it in your wallet earns you rewards — no extra steps needed.But if you want to go a step further, you can use tsUSDe in liquidity pools or farms on TON-based platforms to unlock even more yield. It’s like putting your dollars to work while still staying in stable territory.Where to earn yield with tsUSDeRight now, two of the most active platforms for tsUSDe yield farming on TON are:STON.fi — known for smooth UX and deep liquidityDeDust — fast, lightweight and gaining traction fast.Both let you pair tsUSDe with TON and stake your position to earn trading fees plus additional farming rewards.Did you know? STON.fi has a built-in impermanent loss calculator to help you gauge risk before adding liquidity, while DeDust offers a full portfolio dashboard to track tokens, LPs and rewards in one place.Step-by-step: How to earn yield with tsUSDe1. Connect your walletGo to STON.fi or DeDust.io, connect your TON wallet, and make sure you have some TON in your balance to cover transaction fees.2. Pick a tsUSDe liquidity poolHead to the “Pools” or “Farms” section and find a tsUSDe/TON pool. You’ll see estimated APY numbers, which vary depending on trading volume and incentives. On STON.fi, for example, this pool sometimes hits 30%+ APY.3. Add liquidityClick “Add Liquidity,” then enter the amount of tsUSDe you want to supply. You’ll also need to supply the same dollar value in TON. Once confirmed, you’ll get LP (liquidity provider) tokens showing your share of the pool.4. Stake to boost rewardsNow, stake those LP tokens to earn extra farming rewards. On STON.fi, look for the “Farm” button next to your position. On DeDust, use the “Boost” feature. Once staked, you’ll start earning even more TON on top of trading fees.5. Monitor and claim rewardsYou can check your rewards anytime and claim them whenever you want. You’re in full control; you can unstake or remove your liquidity whenever it suits you.What are the benefits of passive income with tsUSDe?Passive income with tsUSDe comes with unique advantages for users, including:Dollar stability: tsUSDe aims to stay pegged to $1, so your base savings aren’t volatile.Built-in APY: tsUSDe earns ~10% just sitting in your wallet.Extra rewards: Farming lets you boost returns even more through TON incentives.Non-custodial: You keep control of your assets the whole time.What about the risks of TON stablecoin yield?Earning yield with TON stablecoins comes with certain risks to be aware of, such as:Impermanent loss: If TON’s price changes significantly, your share of the pool may shift, reducing your value when you withdraw.Smart contract risk: As with any DeFi platform, there’s always a risk of bugs or exploits.Stablecoin peg risk: tsUSDe is designed to stay at $1, but extreme situations could cause a temporary depeg.Stick with well-known platforms and don’t invest more than you’re comfortable with.Did you know? TON supports TON Proxy, a decentralized anonymity protocol inspired by networks like Tor and I2P. TON Proxy allows users and nodes to obfuscate their identities and traffic.Earn APY with tsUSDe, but carefullyIf you’re already holding tsUSDe, putting it to work on TON is a no-brainer. You get a solid base yield, plus a chance to earn more through farming — all while keeping your savings in dollars. Whether you go with STON.fi or DeDust, the setup is quick, and the returns can add up fast.Start small, be aware of risks, monitor your rewards, and make your stablecoins work harder.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-13T15:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin remains unmatched as a global inflation hedge","Opinion by: Jupiter Zheng, Partner Liquid Fund at HashKey CapitalWhenever Bitcoin falls in value, the narrative is always the same: It’s failing as a hedge against inflation. In the eyes of critics, Bitcoin is not the “digital gold” that so many others claim it to be.With gold hitting all-time highs, these critics have grown louder. If Bitcoin is an inflation hedge, they ask, why isn’t it also rallying as investors seek safety?Even in today’s bearish, high-inflation environment, the cardinal truth holds: Bitcoin is an inflation hedge — arguably the most important one for long-term capital preservation the world has seen. Strength in scarcityBitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins, with full circulation expected by 2140. This built-in scarcity mirrors gold, which has historically served as an inflation hedge. Bitcoin has outperformed gold during multiple periods, such as the COVID-19 era, when global markets were flooded with liquidity.Like gold, Bitcoin works as an inflation hedge over the long term, not the short term. Critics focus too much on short-term volatility and ignore broader trends. Bitcoin has consistently been used as a store of value during extended periods of money printing.Bitcoin is not controlled by any central bank or politician. It’s a decentralized, peer-to-peer system governed by math and consensus — not by election cycles or political pressure. In places like Zimbabwe or Venezuela, where governments destroyed their currencies, Bitcoin has offered a more stable alternative. When faith in traditional systems weakens, Bitcoin often strengthens. Consensus beats centralizationBitcoin’s value isn’t just in its price — it’s in its design. Countries like the US, EU, UAE, Singapore, and Hong Kong have advanced regulations around Bitcoin, but its relevance goes far beyond developed economies.Inflation is an inconvenience in wealthier countries — rising grocery bills and pricier eggs. In struggling economies, inflation can signal political and financial collapse. Bitcoin offers a way out. It’s not theoretical anymore — it’s happening in real life.During Greece’s 2015 crisis, citizens used Bitcoin to bypass capital controls. In Venezuela and Argentina, where national currencies lost most of their value, Bitcoin became a tool for survival. People used it to preserve wealth, access global markets, and transact on decentralized exchanges.Recent: Bitcoin may rival gold as inflation hedge over next decade — Adam BackBitcoin’s borderless, censorship-resistant nature is critical. It doesn’t rely on the decisions of any one institution. It’s protected from debt monetization, interest rate manipulation, and geopolitical pressures. Bitcoin runs on consensus, not command. Consensus matters most when trust in institutions is low. This immutability is a characteristic that investors are undervaluing — and may not appreciate until they need it the most. Portability is powerBitcoin’s resilience also matters in developed markets — especially when traditional systems fail. Banks can collapse. Stock markets can crash. Payment processors can go offline. Bitcoin doesn’t sleep. It runs 24/7, 365 days a year.During the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in March 2023, Bitcoin jumped 23% as investors sought safety outside the traditional banking system. Bitcoin’s availability and independence became its advantage.In a bank failure like Lehman Brothers in 2008, consumers can lose access to their funds for months or even years. Bitcoin, held in self-custody, remains in your control — as long as you have the private keys. No third party is needed.Payment networks like Visa or SWIFT can also become chokepoints — and targets for hackers who want to disrupt the global payments infrastructure. Bitcoin isn’t subject to those bottlenecks. Miners, not banks, verify it. While congestion can slow transactions, scaling solutions are evolving to improve speed and cost.Bitcoin’s digital nature makes it especially valuable during capital controls, inflation, or crisis. It’s hard to seize, devalue, or freeze — giving individuals more autonomy than traditional financial systems allow.A more nuanced term: speculative hedge  Based on these characteristics, Bitcoin is unmistakably a hedge against inflation. Maybe we need a better term for Bitcoin’s central role in our financial futures.A more precise term might be speculative hedge — it offers long-term protection thanks to scarcity, consensus and decentralization. Yet, adoption and price volatility are still hurdles to Bitcoin dethroning gold as a true global inflation hedge. Still, there are encouraging signs. Companies like Strategy, GameStop, Block and MassMutual have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a treasury strategy — with some estimates pointing to one in four companies in the S&P 500 following suit by 2030. More governments are exploring Bitcoin reserves.As a speculative hedge, Bitcoin shines during inflation, currency devaluation, or systemic instability. It’s not a cure-all. Its effectiveness depends on user education, internet access, and geopolitical context. If connectivity disappears entirely — say, during a nuclear war — there will be bigger problems than inflation.Bitcoin is best understood as a financial lifeboat. It’s not perfect. It takes effort to use it correctly. It’s a small measure of preparation for life’s unknowns. But when the ship starts sinking, you’ll wish you had one.Opinion by: Jupiter Zheng, Partner Liquid Fund at HashKey Capital.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-as-inflation-hedge?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-13T14:04:14.000Z,"Bitcoin builders defend role of venture capital in layer-2 growth","Venture capital firms remain critical to infrastructure development in the Bitcoin ecosystem, despite pushback from some in the community, according to builders speaking at the Token2049 conference in Dubai.Charlie Yechuan Hu, CEO of Bitcoin layer-2 protocol Bitlayer, shared his insights on venture capital (VC) firms in the Bitcoin (BTC) ecosystem.Hu told Cointelegraph that he views many VC firms in the space positively, as they offer support to early ventures that need capital to build infrastructure.“You need developers, you need to open up the whole ecosystem foundation, everything,” Hu said. “You need to pay for the cloud, like AWS or RPCs, all that, servers […] So, we have to have VC on that.“Hu argued against the usual Bitcoiner ethos that argues against outsider capital, saying, “It’s difficult to say, okay, let’s do a fair mint, and then have a very successful, healthy treasury, and you have to pay all this stuff.”“It doesn’t work that way,” he said.Related: StarkWare researchers propose smart contracts for Bitcoin with ColliderVMLightning-only stance sparks debateNot everyone agrees. Mike Jarmuz, a managing partner at Bitcoin venture capital firm Lightning Ventures, told Cointelegraph that Lightning is the only L2 his company has invested in and is interested in. He said, “Anything with a ‘token’ that allows for ‘staking’ and earning some absurd APY interest on your Bitcoin should be avoided.”Jarmuz said that Lightning Network, on the other hand, is growing very quickly and makes Bitcoin transactions instant, nearly free and scalable. Bitcoin Visuals data shows that the Lightning Network has a cumulative capacity across all channels equivalent to almost $452 million at the time of writing. He added:“There is no ‘token’ when using the Lightning network. It’s Bitcoin. That to me is the only real L2, at least as of right now.“Lightning Network capacity chart. Source: Bitcoin VisualsJarmuz said that projects not meeting his criteria are “masquerading as useful” while doing nothing for Bitcoin. He claimed that sidechains like the Liquid Network and newer protocols such as e-cash and federations or Ark “are not widely used” but “are at least interesting.” He recognized that those “do not involve a staked token, promising yield,” with projects that have those features, “just waiting for rug pulls and issues.”“We don’t invest in that area,“ he added.Related: Spar supermarket in Switzerland starts accepting Bitcoin paymentsVCs seen as enablers of Bitcoin growthAccording to Hu, VCs bring liquidity, resources and experience to new startups while opening “up all the institutional ideas and connections.” He said that those were important additions to Bitlayer’s resources as well, noting that “we wouldn’t have that if those people didn’t invest in us.”He also argued that VCs tend to back long-term infrastructure efforts rather than speculative projects like memecoins or non-fungible tokens.  That experience was echoed by Walter Maffione, lead engineer at Lightning Network-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Kaleidoswap, who told Cointelegraph that the protocol started as an open-source project and raised a pre-seed investment from Fulgur Ventures and Bitfinex Ventures.“Those funds were used to pay open-source developers and accelerate protocol development, not to build a token or capture governance rights,“ he said.Hu claimed that VCs have contributed significantly to developing layer-2 scalability solutions, wallets, Bitcoin lending and staking protocols. He added:“All of them are VC-backed, including us. And some of them are listed on top exchanges.”Vikash Singh, principal at Bitcoin VC firm Stillmark, told Cointelegraph that when selecting Bitcoin layer-2 protocols to invest in, they consider demonstrated security and robustness, proliferation and adoption of non-speculative use cases and growth of the application layer. Much like Jarmuz, he said that Stillmark believes that proof-of-work is the superior consensus model.Still, unlike Jarmuz, Singh said proof-of-stake or Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus “may be suitable for Bitcoin sidechains and rollups.”Magazine: ‘Bitcoin layer 2s’ aren’t really L2s at all: Here’s why that matters",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-builders-defend-vc-role-layer-two-development?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

The fund would have allowed Arizona to hold crypto assets obtained through seizures or legislative allocations.“Current volatility in cryptocurrency markets does not make a prudent fit for general fund dollars,” she stated in her veto letter. “I have already signed legislation this session which allows the state to utilize cryptocurrency without placing general fund dollars at risk,” she added.That decision followed her veto of Senate Bill 1025 — the more ambitious “Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act” — on May 3. It would have authorized up to 10% of the state’s treasury and retirement funds to be invested in Bitcoin and other digital assets.According to data from bitcoinlaws.io, 26 US states have introduced strategic crypto reserve bills, with 18 of them currently active. Hobbs also vetoed Senate Bill 1024, which would have permitted state agencies to accept cryptocurrency payments for taxes, fines and fees via approved service providers.Although the proposal attempted to shield the state from direct exposure to price volatility, Hobbs said it still introduced “too much risk.”Source: State of Arizona, Office of the GovernorRelated: Taiwan lawmaker calls for Bitcoin reserve at national conferenceHobbs approves Bitcoin ATM billOn May 12, Hobbs approved House Bill 2387, which introduces new consumer protection rules for cryptocurrency kiosk (ATM) operators, aiming to reduce fraud and improve transparency.The bill mandates that kiosks display clear, multilingual warnings about common crypto scams and require users to acknowledge these risks before completing transactions. Operators must also provide detailed receipts that include transaction data, contact information, fees and refund policies.Furthermore, the bill caps transactions at $2,000 per day for new customers and $10,500 per day for returning users after 10 days. Kiosk providers must also offer 24/7 toll-free customer service and post the number visibly on each machine.Under the bill, if a new user is tricked into sending crypto under false pretenses and reports it with proof within 30 days, they are entitled to a full refund, including fees.According to CoinATMRadar, there are currently 20 active Bitcoin ATMs in Arizona. Notably, Hobbs has not entirely closed the door on digital assets.

2025-05-13T08:40:00.000Z,"From Netflix series to crypto game: Black Mirror’s AI reputation system, explained","Black Mirror experience: When sci-fi social scores meet blockchain              Created by Charlie Brooker, this British sci-fi series debuted in 2011 and quickly became a cultural touchstone for its dark, satirical take on technology.Imagine a world where every like, comment and blockchain transaction shapes your social standing, where an AI watches your every digital move and assigns you a score that dictates your rewards or your restrictions. Sounds like something straight out of science fiction, right? Well, it is — until now. Black Mirror, Netflix’s chilling anthology series, and one of its most iconic concepts have inspired a real-world crypto game.Dubbed the Black Mirror Experience, this project brings the show’s AI-driven reputation system to life, blending dystopian storytelling with blockchain technology. If you haven’t seen Black Mirror, you must know that each standalone episode dives into a different scenario — think surveillance gone wild, social media obsession run amok or AI with a mind of its own. It’s not exactly feel-good TV, but it’s gripping, thought-provoking and often uncomfortably close to reality.The episode that sparked this crypto game is “Nosedive” from Season 3. Picture this: a pastel-colored world where everyone rates each other on a five-star scale after every interaction. Your average score isn’t just a badge of honor, but it determines your job prospects, housing options and even how people treat you. The protagonist, Lacie, spends her days chasing approval, plastering on a smile to boost her rating. It’s a biting critique of performative social media culture, and now, it’s the blueprint for a blockchain-based experiment.Did you know? Reputation systems predate AI and are rooted in human trust mechanisms like word-of-mouth and credit scores. The internet era introduced digital versions, such as eBay’s feedback system in the late 1990s, where buyers and sellers rated each other. These manual systems were simple but vulnerable to fake reviews and retaliation.                  How Black Mirror Experience works              Built on the KOR Protocol, this dystopian game uses AI to rate your social and blockchain activity, turning your digital behavior into real Web3 rewards or penalties.The Black Mirror Experience is built on a transparent and tamper-resistant system developed by major players in gaming and blockchain tech, including Animoca, Niantic and Avalanche.At its core is Iris, an AI virtual assistant that’s equal parts judge, jury and scorekeeper. To join the fun:You connect a compatible crypto wallet and your X account. From there, Iris gets to work, analyzing your online behavior, such as your posts, your follows and your blockchain moves, and assigns you a reputation score.This isn’t just a vanity metric; your score unlocks real perks in the Black Mirror universe, like token airdrops, early feature access and voting power in narrative-driven events.Lower scores?Well, you might find yourself locked out of the good stuff. Every user gets a Social ID Card and a non-fungible token (NFT) that logs your score and tracks your digital footprint over time. This NFT tracks behavior through digital badges — awarded for positive actions — and “stains,” which mark negative ones, creating a transparent audit trail readable by other applications. Beyond its role in the game, the Social ID Card doubles as a portable Web3 identity and onchain passport, allowing users to carry their reputation across the Black Mirror Web3 ecosystem. Iris evaluates a wide range of activities, from holding or trading tokens and NFTs to engaging with decentralized communities and posting on social media, distinguishing genuine contributors from trolls or scammers. But what powers this reputation system behind the scenes?Blockchain is the backbone here. Every action you take, whether it’s posting on X or trading tokens, gets recorded on the ledger. Your reputation score? Calculated by smart contracts, not controlled by a hidden authority.Did you know? The project has already gained traction, with over 13,000 reputation IDs claimed, signaling early interest.                  What’s the catch? Implications of the AI reputation system              A game where your online presence can earn you rewards sounds interesting. But, like any Black Mirror story, there’s a darker layer to consider.To start, Iris needs access to your data to function. That includes your social media activity and blockchain history. While the system claims to be “fair and transparent,” who’s overseeing it? How is the data stored? And what happens if it gets leaked or misused?Gamifying behavior might encourage a more positive digital environment, but it could also push people to curate their actions for approval, similar to Lacie’s forced smiles in “Nosedive.”The bigger concern is who decides what counts as “good” behavior. Algorithms can lack nuance, and if the system is biased, it could end up punishing users unfairly or reinforcing existing divides.And this isn’t just fiction. China’s social credit system, introduced in 2014, assesses citizens’ trustworthiness based on behaviors like paying taxes or purchasing domestic products. Positive actions can boost one’s score, while negative behaviors, such as committing crimes or making unfavorable statements about the government, can lower it. Consequences for low scores include reduced access to credit and fewer business opportunities.The Black Mirror Experience may be a game, but it hints at how reputation tech could shape the future.Did you know? Nosedive isn’t the only Black Mirror episode to explore reputation systems. Hated in the Nation also showed how social media can become a weapon.                   Risks every Black Mirror Experience game player should know              While the Black Mirror Experience offers a thrilling dive into a dystopian world, blending cutting-edge tech with Black Mirror’s signature unease, it’s not without its risks. Data privacy concerns: Your personal information, including social media activity and blockchain transactions, could be vulnerable to leaks or misuse. Even with blockchain’s security, no system is entirely hack-proof.AI bias: Iris, the AI, might misinterpret your actions, leading to unfair reputation scores. This could lock you out of rewards or tarnish your digital identity without a clear way to appeal.Performative behavior: The game’s reward system might encourage users to act in ways that boost their scores rather than being authentic. This could create a culture of fake positivity, mirroring the dystopian themes of Black Mirror.Psychological stress: Constantly being rated and ranked can take a toll on mental health, leading to anxiety or obsession over your score. The pressure to maintain a high reputation could spill over into real life, blurring the lines between game and reality.Normalization of dystopian systems: By gamifying a reputation system, the project risks making such concepts seem normal or even desirable. This could desensitize users to the potential dangers of real-world social credit systems.That said, it’s important to remember that the Black Mirror Experience is a bold experiment. It’s pushing boundaries, merging entertainment with Web3 in ways we’ve never seen. The risks are real, but so is the innovation. As with any tech that blurs the line between fiction and reality, the key is to stay aware and maybe watch your score, but don’t let it rule you.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/from-netflix-series-to-crypto-game-black-mirrors-ai-reputation-system-explained?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Siu said this regulatory hostility stifled innovation and discouraged overseas companies from entering the US market.In contrast, Trump’s return to office has been accompanied by pledges to support the crypto sector and a rollback of enforcement activity. Siu described this as “a unique moment in time,” adding that not taking advantage of it “would be one heck of a wasted opportunity.”Since Trump’s election victory, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped or paused over a dozen enforcement cases against crypto companies.Additionally, the Department of Justice recently announced the dissolution of its cryptocurrency enforcement unit, signaling a softer approach to the sector.This hands-on approach appears to be boosting industry confidence. OKX, for example, has announced plans to establish a US headquarters in San Jose, California, just months after settling a $504 million case with US authorities.On April 28, Nexo, which left the US at the end of 2022, citing a lack of regulatory clarity, revealed that it is reentering the US market.Magazine: Bitcoin eyes ‘crazy numbers,’ JD Vance set for Bitcoin talk: Hodler’s Digest, May 4 – 10",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/animoca-brands-new-york-listing-trump-crypto-push?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

But the court found, for a start, that claims of securities law violations couldn’t stand as it wasn’t alleged that his JENNER buys took place in the US, as the law requires, and gave “scant details” about the purchases.The court didn’t allow the class to swap its lead for a US-based member, adding it must report by May 16 on how the suit will proceed (highlights added for emphasis). Source: PACERCourt dismisses all claims by JENNER tokenholdersIn all, Judge Blumenfeld dismissed a further eight claims the class group brought in an amended complaint filed in February, which included accusations that Jenner and Hutchins either made misleading statements, sold unregistered securities, or committed various fraud.Judge Blumenfeld said the suit failed to allege that Jenner sold the token through a prospectus that contained an untrue statement, as “Greenfield admits that the $JENNER tokens were not sold through a prospectus.”The court also tossed a common-law fraud accusation, saying the complaint alleged omitted information and noted various X posts by Jenner “stating that she would continue to support the tokens,” but it did not identify which of the statements related to the fraud claim.The group also accused Hutchins of aiding and abetting Jenner’s allegedly fraudulent conduct, but Judge Blumenfeld said that claim failed as the complaint “does not adequately allege any viable fraud claim.”In a footnote, Judge Blumenfeld said Jenner and the class group disputed whether the JENNER token was a security, but he was not going to decide at this stage as the “securities claims fail on other grounds.”Related: Top TRUMP whales hold $174M in tokens ahead of dinner with US president “Because the determination of whether the tokens are securities is fact-dependent and may be affected by an amended pleading, the Court declines to resolve that issue at this stage and instead assumes without deciding that the tokens are securities subject to the federal securities laws,” he wrote.JENNER first launched in May 2024 via Pump.fun on the Solana blockchain but was soon embroiled in controversy after Jenner and other memecoin launching celebrities claimed collaborator Sahil Arora scammed them. Jenner relaunched the token on Ethereum, which the class group claimed tanked the value of the original Solana token, but gave Jenner the benefit of collecting a 3% fee on every transaction.JENNER has lost essentially all its value since launch.
