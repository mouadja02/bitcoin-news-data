This allows the sellers and the buyers to use cryptocurrency without involving banks. The new unit, led by Christie‚Äôs Southern California CEO Aaron Kirman, manages over $1 billion in crypto-listed properties. This is open to buyers paying in crypto only. Christie‚Äôs Offers $1 billion Luxury Crypto-Listed Properties The unit led by Kirman is now planning to expand the crypto real estate models, which previously involved the sale of a $65 million Beverly Hills mansion. The move aligns with regulatory developments of the US Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). In June, it directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to explore treating crypto as a reserve asset in risk assessment for mortgages. Properties currently listed for bitcoin include ‚Äî $118 million La Fin mansion in Bel Air, the $18 million Invisible House in Joshua Tree, and $63 million Nightingale property in Beverly Hills. Proper Security Check to Ensure Protection in Crypto Transaction The estate network has a legal and crypto compliance team of lawyers, analysts, and crypto experts to ensure the security of the crypto transactions during trading. The section will run complete legal checks on the origin of the assets to ensure their legality. Kirman said that these wealthy crypto asset holders seeking real-world assets prefer to avoid traditional banking systems, keeping their identities protected. So, these blockchain-based asset transactions will make it harder for the public to trace the ownership. Christie‚Äôs Follows the Global Trend of Crypto As the U.S. pushes forward the evolution of digital assets with the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act, global businesses, even real estate networks, adopt the trend. In an interview , Kirman said, ‚ÄúThe trend was obvious ‚Äî crypto is here to stay‚Ä¶it‚Äôs only going to get bigger over the next few years.‚Äù Kirman estimates that in five years, over one-third of US home sales could involve cryptocurrency. He also said that discussions are currently underway with major banks to allow crypto-based home financing.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-news-christies-enters-the-crypto-real-estate-game-with-1b-property-portfolio/,"REGULATION|BTC|FIAT|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

2025-07-25T06:47:07,"Why the Crypto Market is Down Today: BTC, ETH, XRP Lead the Drop?","The post Why the Crypto Market is Down Today: BTC, ETH, XRP Lead the Drop? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The global cryptocurrency market has taken a sharp downturn today, shedding over 1% from its total market cap, now sitting at $3.8 trillion. Meanwhile, 24-hour trading volume has spiked by 9.15%, a sign of turbulence rather than growth. From Bitcoin‚Äôs stumble below $116k to widespread liquidations across altcoins, today‚Äôs decline is driven by a combination of over-leveraged bets, profit-taking, and capital flight from riskier assets. What Happened? Long Squeeze Triggers Chain Reaction Bitcoin‚Äôs drop below $116k shattered its major short-term support, triggering a massive $585M in long liquidations within 24 hours. ETH followed closely, losing $104M in longs, while altcoins like Dogecoin (-7%) and PAAL AI (-4.8%) were among the worst performers. The average funding rate across exchanges (+0.008%) indicates excessive bullish leverage, now being punished. The domino effect pushed BTC liquidations up by 123%, forcing automated sell-offs and creating further downward pressure. Why Now? Profit-Taking After a 30-Day Rally After a 16% gain over the last month, which was mainly driven by ETF optimism and retail FOMO, many traders are now cashing in. The 21-day RSI climbed to 74.25 (overbought territory), while MACD showed bearish divergence (-3.68B), hinting at trend exhaustion. Stablecoin inflows surged $11B in July, a signal that investors are temporarily parking funds in safer assets. Altcoins Face Added Pressure Rotation into Safety Altcoins are bearing the brunt as Bitcoin dominance rises to 60.8%. Illiquid and speculative tokens, such as memecoins, tanked sharply due to post-hype sell-offs and thin order books. Uncertainty around the GENIUS Act‚Äôs stablecoin regulations is further driving caution, reducing trader appetite for high-beta bets. Conclusion Today‚Äôs dip is less about panic and more about profit-taking, exaggerated by a high-leverage market setup. With the Fear & Greed Index still at a greed-driven score of 66, sentiment remains optimistic, but fragile. If BTC can defend $115k ahead of Friday‚Äôs U.S. PCE inflation data, we could see fresh buying emerge. However, a deeper macro sell-off or further liquidations may flip the sentiment decisively bearish. FAQs What triggered the market drop today? A combination of long position liquidations, overbought technicals, and profit-taking after a major rally. Is this the start of a deeper correction? Not necessarily, as the key support at BTC‚Äôs $115k and ETH at $3,500 could bring dip-buyers back if held. What should I watch next? Keep an eye on Friday‚Äôs U.S. PCE data, Bitcoin‚Äôs support at $113k‚Äì$115k, and ETF inflow trends.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-the-crypto-market-is-down-today-btc-eth-xrp-lead-the-drop/,"BTC|MARKET|ETH|TRADING|XRP","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-07-25T06:45:10,"Bitcoin Correction: Why This ‚ÄòDip‚Äô is a Golden Opportunity, Not a Crisis","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Correction: Why This ‚ÄòDip‚Äô is a Golden Opportunity, Not a Crisis In the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, a price dip often triggers alarm bells. When Bitcoin, the undisputed king of digital assets, experiences a significant drop, the natural instinct for many is to panic. Is this the start of a bear market? Is it time to exit? However, what if the recent Bitcoin correction isn‚Äôt a sign of impending doom but rather a healthy, necessary recalibration? What if this ‚Äòdip‚Äô is actually a golden opportunity disguised as a setback? Recent insights from crypto analytics firm Swissblock suggest precisely that. Their analysis, shared in a post on X, argues that Bitcoin‚Äôs move below its established trading range is not indicative of capitulation ‚Äì the desperate, widespread selling that marks a market bottom ‚Äì but rather a strategic, rotation-led correction. This perspective offers a refreshing counter-narrative to the fear often propagated during market downturns, urging investors to look beyond the immediate price action and understand the underlying market dynamics. Decoding the Latest Bitcoin Correction : Rotation vs. Capitulation To truly grasp Swissblock‚Äôs optimistic outlook, it‚Äôs essential to understand the distinction between a ‚Äòrotation-led correction‚Äô and ‚Äòcapitulation.‚Äô These terms are crucial for interpreting market sentiment and making informed investment decisions, especially during a significant Bitcoin correction . Capitulation: The Panic Button Capitulation refers to a period of intense, widespread selling driven by fear and exhaustion. Investors, having endured prolonged losses or significant drops, finally give up hope and sell their holdings at any price to avoid further pain. This often marks the final phase of a bear market, characterized by: Extreme negative sentiment and widespread FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt). High trading volumes during the sell-off, indicating many participants exiting. Often accompanied by significant liquidation events in derivatives markets. A sense of ‚Äògiving up‚Äô among even long-term holders. Historically, capitulation phases are brutal but often precede a market bottom and subsequent recovery. They are usually identifiable by panic selling that extends beyond rational profit-taking or rebalancing. Rotation-Led Correction: The Healthy Rebalance In contrast, a rotation-led correction is a more organic, healthy market process. It occurs when capital moves from one asset or sector to another, or when investors take profits after a significant run-up and then look for new entry points. It‚Äôs a rebalancing act, not a panic exit. Key characteristics include: Profit-taking by short-term traders and early investors. Reallocation of funds within the crypto ecosystem (e.g., from Bitcoin to altcoins, or vice-versa, or even into stablecoins temporarily). A lack of extreme fear, with underlying bullish sentiment remaining intact. Often occurs in a low-risk environment, suggesting systemic stability. Creates fresh liquidity and new entry points for patient investors. Swissblock‚Äôs assertion is that the current Bitcoin correction falls firmly into this latter category, indicating a market that is consolidating its gains rather than collapsing. The Swissblock Blueprint: Why This Bitcoin Correction Isn‚Äôt Cause for Alarm Swissblock‚Äôs analysis isn‚Äôt just a hunch; it‚Äôs backed by specific indicators that paint a picture of resilience rather than weakness. Let‚Äôs delve into the key metrics they highlighted that underscore the robust nature of the current Bitcoin correction : Is the Risk Index Signaling Danger, or Opportunity? Swissblock noted that their proprietary Risk Index stood at 0. A low Risk Index suggests that the market is not in an overheated state, where speculative activity is rampant and prices are unsustainably high. When the Risk Index is low, it implies that the market is not characterized by excessive greed or leverage. This creates a more stable foundation, making any price pullbacks less likely to cascade into a full-blown collapse. Think of it like a car engine: if it‚Äôs not redlining, a slight deceleration is just normal driving, not a breakdown. Are We Overheating? Signs of a Healthy Market Another crucial point from Swissblock was the absence of ‚Äúsigns of overheating.‚Äù What does this mean in practical terms for the Bitcoin correction ? Overheating in crypto markets is typically indicated by: Excessive Funding Rates: High positive funding rates in perpetual futures markets suggest traders are paying a premium to hold long positions, indicating over-optimism and potential for liquidations. High Open Interest: A rapid increase in open interest without corresponding price movement can signal a build-up of speculative positions. Euphoric Sentiment: Overly bullish sentiment across social media and mainstream news, often leading to irrational exuberance. The fact that these indicators were not flashing red during the recent Bitcoin correction reinforces the idea that the market was not due for a catastrophic fall but rather a natural unwinding of some leveraged positions and profit-taking. Is the Technical Structure Still Intact After the Bitcoin Correction ? Swissblock emphasized that the ‚Äútechnical structure still intact‚Äù is a powerful bullish signal. This refers to the underlying patterns and levels on price charts that indicate the overall trend. Despite the recent drop, key technical support levels were held, and the broader trend of higher lows and higher highs (characteristic of an uptrend) was not broken. This includes: Key Moving Averages: Often, Bitcoin bounces off crucial moving averages (like the 50-day or 200-day MA) during corrections, indicating these levels act as strong support. Trendline Support: Long-term trendlines that define the bullish trajectory remain unbroken. Volume Analysis: The sell-off volume was not indicative of panic, often lower than previous rallies, suggesting a lack of strong selling pressure. The resilience of Bitcoin‚Äôs technical foundation during this Bitcoin correction suggests that the asset is merely consolidating before its next leg up, rather than entering a reversal. Historical Parallels: Learning from Past Bitcoin Corrections History, as they say, doesn‚Äôt repeat itself, but it often rhymes. Examining past Bitcoin corrections can provide valuable context and reinforce the idea that dips are often part of a healthy bull market cycle. Bitcoin has a storied history of significant pullbacks that, in retrospect, served as prime accumulation zones for long-term investors. Consider the bull run of 2017, which saw multiple 30-40% corrections before Bitcoin reached its then-all-time high. Or the 2021 bull market, which experienced a major 50%+ Bitcoin correction in May, only to rebound strongly later that year. These instances were terrifying for many in the moment, leading to widespread fear and calls for the ‚Äòend of crypto.‚Äô Yet, for those who understood the underlying bullish trend and the nature of these corrections, they presented unparalleled opportunities. The current Bitcoin correction , while unsettling for some, aligns with this historical pattern of healthy pullbacks within a larger uptrend. It‚Äôs a test of conviction, separating those with a long-term vision from those swayed by short-term volatility. Seizing the Moment: Is This Bitcoin Correction Your Buying Opportunity? If the analysis points away from capitulation and towards a healthy rotation, then the logical conclusion is that this Bitcoin correction presents a strategic buying opportunity. But how does one approach ‚Äòbuying the dip‚Äô effectively and responsibly? The Psychology of ‚ÄòBuying the Dip‚Äô It‚Äôs easier said than done. Human psychology often works against us in financial markets. When prices are falling, fear dictates caution, making us hesitant to buy. Conversely, when prices are soaring, greed takes over, encouraging us to buy at the top. Overcoming this requires discipline and a long-term perspective. Strategic Approaches During a Bitcoin Correction : Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the absolute bottom (which is nearly impossible), DCA involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals (e.g., weekly or monthly), regardless of the price. During a Bitcoin correction , this strategy allows you to buy more Bitcoin when prices are lower, effectively reducing your average purchase price over time. It removes emotion from the equation and is a powerful tool for long-term accumulation. Risk Management: Even in a ‚Äòlow-risk environment,‚Äô no investment is without risk. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Consider setting stop-loss orders if you are trading, or simply holding through the volatility if you are a long-term investor. Diversifying your portfolio beyond just Bitcoin can also mitigate risk. Long-Term Vision: For many, Bitcoin is a long-term investment in a decentralized future. Short-term price fluctuations, including healthy corrections, are just noise. Focus on the fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin, its increasing adoption, and its scarcity. Beyond the Charts: Broader Market Factors Influencing the Bitcoin Correction While technical analysis provides invaluable insights, a comprehensive understanding of the Bitcoin correction also requires looking at the broader economic and institutional landscape. Several macro and micro factors continue to underpin Bitcoin‚Äôs bullish outlook, making the recent dip appear even more transient: Institutional Adoption: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in major markets has opened the floodgates for institutional capital. These entities often have longer investment horizons and can absorb large amounts of Bitcoin, providing a strong demand floor. Even during a Bitcoin correction , these inflows tend to be consistent, signaling long-term conviction. Macroeconomic Headwinds vs. Tailwinds: While global inflation and interest rate hikes can create short-term pressures, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a hedge against traditional financial instability and currency debasement. As central banks navigate complex economic environments, Bitcoin‚Äôs appeal as a scarce, decentralized asset grows. Bitcoin Halving Cycle: Historically, Bitcoin‚Äôs price cycles have been heavily influenced by its halving events, which reduce the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market. The most recent halving has just passed, and previous cycles suggest that the period following a halving is often characterized by significant price appreciation after an initial consolidation phase, making the current Bitcoin correction a natural part of this cycle. On-Chain Metrics: Data from the blockchain itself often provides a clearer picture than price charts alone. Metrics like long-term holder accumulation, decreasing exchange reserves, and healthy network activity continue to suggest strong underlying demand and a reduced supply overhang, indicating that holders are not panicking during this Bitcoin correction . Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights During a Bitcoin Correction Understanding that a Bitcoin correction can be a buying opportunity is one thing; acting on it wisely is another. Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate the current market environment: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): While expert analysis from firms like Swissblock is valuable, always cross-reference information and form your own conclusions. Understand the technology, the market dynamics, and your own risk tolerance. Develop a Clear Investment Strategy: Whether you‚Äôre a short-term trader or a long-term investor, have a plan. Define your entry and exit points, your risk management parameters, and your overall goals. Stick to your plan during periods of volatility. Stay Informed, Not Obsessed: Keep up with major news and market trends, but avoid constant chart-watching, which can lead to emotional decisions. Focus on the bigger picture. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin is a cornerstone, consider diversifying into other promising cryptocurrencies or traditional assets to spread risk. Consider Long-Term Holding (HODLing): For many, the most effective strategy during a Bitcoin correction is simply to ‚ÄòHODL‚Äô ‚Äì hold on for dear life. This means resisting the urge to sell during dips and trusting in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term growth trajectory. Conclusion: Embracing the Opportunity in Every Bitcoin Correction The recent Bitcoin correction , initially a source of anxiety for many, is increasingly being understood as a healthy and necessary phase within a larger bullish cycle. As Swissblock‚Äôs analysis eloquently puts it, this is not capitulation driven by fear, but a rotation-led adjustment indicative of a market rebalancing itself in a low-risk environment. The underlying technical structure remains robust, and there are no signs of the speculative overheating that precedes major crashes. For discerning investors, this period offers a compelling opportunity. Rather than a signal to abandon ship, it‚Äôs a chance to accumulate Bitcoin at more favorable prices, reinforcing positions in an asset poised for continued growth. By understanding the nuances of market corrections, leveraging strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging, and maintaining a long-term perspective, investors can transform perceived setbacks into strategic advantages. The world of Bitcoin remains dynamic, but its fundamental strength and trajectory suggest that this ‚Äòdip‚Äô is indeed a golden opportunity, not a crisis. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About the Bitcoin Correction Q1: What is the main difference between a ‚Äòrotation-led correction‚Äô and ‚Äòcapitulation‚Äô? A1: A rotation-led correction is a healthy market rebalancing where capital shifts or profits are taken, often in a low-risk environment, without widespread panic. Capitulation, on the other hand, is a desperate, widespread selling event driven by extreme fear and exhaustion, usually marking the bottom of a bear market. Q2: How does Swissblock‚Äôs ‚ÄòRisk Index at 0‚Äô indicate a buying opportunity? A2: A Risk Index at 0 suggests the market is not overheated with excessive speculation or leverage. This indicates a more stable environment, meaning that any price drop is less likely to be catastrophic and more likely to be a temporary pullback, making it a potentially safer entry point for investors. Q3: What are some signs that the market is ‚Äòoverheating‚Äô that Swissblock looked for? A3: Signs of overheating typically include excessively high funding rates in futures markets, a rapid increase in open interest, and widespread euphoric sentiment. The absence of these indicators during the recent Bitcoin correction suggests the market wasn‚Äôt due for a major collapse. Q4: Why is Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) recommended during a Bitcoin correction ? A4: DCA involves investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price. During a Bitcoin correction , this strategy allows you to buy more Bitcoin when prices are lower, reducing your average purchase cost over time. It helps to mitigate risk by removing the need to perfectly time the market bottom and smooths out volatility. Q5: How do institutional adoption and Bitcoin Halving affect the long-term outlook despite a Bitcoin correction ? A5: Institutional adoption, particularly through ETFs, brings consistent demand and stability, providing a strong long-term demand floor. The Bitcoin Halving, which reduces the supply of new Bitcoin, historically precedes significant price appreciation after an initial consolidation, reinforcing a bullish long-term outlook despite short-term corrections.

This was also a new inflow record for the asset manager, observed industry expert Nate Geraci. The total inflow for the day for spot Ether ETFs in the United States was $231 million, marking the fifteenth consecutive trading day in a row without an outflow. The last aggregate outflow from the nine funds was just $1.9 million on July 2. More than $3 billion has entered the funds over the past seven trading days, representing about a third of the entire inflow since they launched in July 2024. Geraci also observed on Friday that spot Ether ETFs have taken in more new capital than spot Bitcoin ETFs in each of the past six trading days, with $2.4 billion compared to $830 million in totals. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúnoticeable difference,‚Äù he said, adding that it is also ‚Äúsomething to watch.‚Äù Bitwise has estimated that ETPs and corporate treasuries have combined to buy 2.8 million ETH since mid-May, around 32 times the net new supply over the same time period. ETH Holds Steady, BTC Dumps The sustained buying pressure has prevented ETH from doing its usual dump when Bitcoin retreats. In fact, ETH has remained flat on the day while BTC dumped more than 3% over the past 12 hours. Ether prices are currently at $3,630, and the asset has entered a range-bound channel over the past week.

2025-07-25T06:40:11,"Bitcoin Acquisition: The Smarter Web Company‚Äôs Bold Bet on Digital Gold","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Acquisition: The Smarter Web Company‚Äôs Bold Bet on Digital Gold The digital asset landscape continues to evolve at a breathtaking pace, with Bitcoin leading the charge as a preferred treasury reserve asset for an increasing number of forward-thinking corporations. In a move that underscores growing institutional confidence in digital gold, The Smarter Web Company (SWC), a prominent UK-based web development firm, recently made headlines with its latest significant Bitcoin acquisition . This strategic purchase isn‚Äôt just a fleeting headline; it represents a powerful statement about the future of corporate finance and the undeniable appeal of decentralized assets in an uncertain economic climate. Why are Companies Doubling Down on Bitcoin Acquisition? In an era marked by fluctuating global economies and persistent inflation concerns, businesses are constantly seeking innovative ways to protect and grow their capital. For many, traditional treasury strategies are no longer sufficient. This is where Bitcoin steps onto the corporate stage, offering a compelling alternative to conventional cash reserves or low-yielding bonds. The decision by companies like SWC to engage in substantial Bitcoin acquisition is driven by several key factors: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed supply of 21 million coins makes it inherently deflationary, a stark contrast to fiat currencies susceptible to quantitative easing and devaluation. Companies view it as a robust shield against the eroding purchasing power of traditional money. Digital Gold Narrative: Often dubbed ‚Äúdigital gold,‚Äù Bitcoin shares properties with its physical counterpart ‚Äì scarcity, divisibility, and portability ‚Äì but surpasses it in ease of transfer and storage in the digital realm. It‚Äôs seen as a store of value in the 21st century. Balance Sheet Diversification: Smart financial management dictates diversification. Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury provides an uncorrelated asset, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk and enhancing long-term returns. Future-Proofing Business: Companies operating in the tech sector, especially, recognize the accelerating shift towards a digital-first economy. Embracing Bitcoin isn‚Äôt just a financial play; it‚Äôs an alignment with the very technological innovations they often champion. It signals a progressive stance and a readiness to operate within the emerging Web3 landscape. Pioneers like MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, have famously adopted Bitcoin as their primary treasury reserve asset, inspiring countless others to follow suit. While MicroStrategy‚Äôs scale of Bitcoin acquisition is unparalleled, the trend is filtering down to businesses of all sizes, from tech startups to established enterprises across various industries. The Smarter Web Company‚Äôs Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition: A Closer Look The recent announcement from The Smarter Web Company (SWC) via X (formerly Twitter) sent ripples of interest across the crypto community. A UK-based web development firm, SWC‚Äôs latest purchase of an additional 225 BTC significantly bolsters its digital asset portfolio. This single transaction brings their total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 1,825 BTC, solidifying their position as a notable corporate holder of the world‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency. For a web development company, this move is particularly insightful. SWC isn‚Äôt merely speculating on price; they are likely integrating a long-term vision where digital assets play a crucial role in their financial strategy and potentially, their service offerings. It reflects a deep understanding of the underlying technology and its potential to reshape global commerce and finance. This isn‚Äôt their first foray into crypto, but rather a continuation of a deliberate, calculated strategy. Let‚Äôs visualize the growth of SWC‚Äôs Bitcoin treasury: Date of Announcement (Approx.) Amount Purchased (BTC) Total Holdings (BTC) Early 2023 Initial Accumulation ~1,000 Mid-2023 Additional Purchases ~1,600 Recent Announcement +225 1,825 This incremental approach to Bitcoin acquisition demonstrates a prudent and consistent strategy, allowing them to average down their cost basis and mitigate the impact of market volatility. It‚Äôs a testament to their long-term conviction in Bitcoin‚Äôs value proposition. What Does This Bitcoin Acquisition Mean for the Broader Market? Every major corporate Bitcoin acquisition sends a ripple through the cryptocurrency market, influencing sentiment, liquidity, and even the perception of digital assets among traditional investors. SWC‚Äôs latest move contributes to several significant trends: Validation of Bitcoin as a Legitimate Asset: Each corporate treasury adoption adds another layer of legitimacy to Bitcoin, moving it further away from speculative novelty and closer to a recognized financial asset. This helps dispel skepticism and encourages more mainstream engagement. Increased Institutional Demand: As more companies follow suit, the demand side for Bitcoin strengthens. This sustained buying pressure from institutional entities can contribute to price stability and long-term appreciation, provided supply remains constrained. Positive Market Sentiment: News of significant corporate buys often acts as a bullish signal, boosting investor confidence and attracting fresh capital into the market. It reinforces the narrative that ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù is entering the space. Diversification of Corporate Treasury Strategies: SWC‚Äôs example highlights a growing paradigm shift in how companies manage their balance sheets. It encourages other firms, particularly those in tech-adjacent sectors, to explore similar strategies. However, it‚Äôs crucial to acknowledge the inherent challenges. While corporate adoption is overwhelmingly positive, it also brings: Volatility Exposure: Holding a volatile asset like Bitcoin means corporate balance sheets are exposed to significant price swings, which can impact quarterly earnings reports and investor perception. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Companies holding substantial amounts of Bitcoin must navigate complex and sometimes ambiguous rules regarding accounting, taxation, and custody. Security Risks: Securing large amounts of digital assets requires robust cybersecurity measures and sophisticated cold storage solutions to mitigate the risk of hacks or loss. Despite these challenges, the increasing frequency and size of corporate Bitcoin acquisition suggest that the perceived benefits far outweigh the risks for many progressive companies. Navigating the Future: Actionable Insights for Businesses and Investors The Smarter Web Company‚Äôs latest move serves as a valuable case study for both businesses contemplating their own crypto strategy and individual investors looking to understand market dynamics. Here are some actionable insights: For Businesses Considering Bitcoin Acquisition: Conduct Thorough Due Diligence: Understand the technology, market dynamics, and regulatory environment before making any significant moves. Don‚Äôt rush into a Bitcoin acquisition without proper research. Develop a Clear Strategy: Define your objectives for holding Bitcoin (e.g., inflation hedge, long-term growth, diversification). Establish clear policies for acquisition, custody, and potential liquidation. Prioritize Secure Custody: Implement institutional-grade security solutions for storing digital assets. Consider multi-signature wallets, cold storage, and reputable third-party custodians. Understand Accounting and Tax Implications: Consult with financial and legal experts to navigate the complex accounting treatment and tax obligations associated with holding cryptocurrencies. Start Small and Scale: You don‚Äôt need to commit a large percentage of your treasury initially. A phased approach allows for learning and adaptation. For Individual Investors: Research Corporate Holdings: Keep an eye on companies making significant crypto purchases. These often signal strong conviction and can provide insights into broader market trends. Understanding corporate Bitcoin acquisition can inform your own strategy. Long-Term Perspective: Corporate treasury strategies are typically long-term. This aligns with the ‚ÄúHODL‚Äù philosophy often advocated for Bitcoin, suggesting patience rather than short-term trading. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin is a powerful asset, a balanced portfolio that includes other asset classes remains crucial for managing risk. Stay Informed: The crypto space is dynamic. Regularly follow reputable news sources, market analyses, and regulatory updates to make informed decisions. The ongoing trend of corporate Bitcoin acquisition underscores a fundamental shift in how value is perceived and stored in the global economy. Companies like SWC are not just buying a digital asset; they are investing in a future where decentralized technologies play a central role in financial infrastructure. In conclusion, The Smarter Web Company‚Äôs latest significant Bitcoin acquisition is more than just a financial transaction; it‚Äôs a resounding vote of confidence in the enduring value and future potential of Bitcoin. As more businesses recognize its strategic advantages ‚Äì from inflation hedging to balance sheet diversification ‚Äì we can expect this trend to accelerate, further legitimizing Bitcoin‚Äôs role in the global financial landscape. This ongoing corporate embrace not only strengthens Bitcoin‚Äôs foundation but also paves the way for a more digitally integrated and resilient economic future. It‚Äôs a powerful testament to the fact that digital assets are no longer a niche interest but a serious consideration for astute corporate treasuries worldwide.

Around $12M‚Äì$14M moved across chains, touching BTC, ETH, BNB, ARB, and TRX. Nine user accounts were hit, but here‚Äôs the good news: Woo X says all affected funds will be fully reimbursed. The Woo X Breach In Summary It started with Cyvers Alerts, a blockchain security partner, flagging suspicious movements,including a $1M USDT transfer. Woo X responded fast. Withdrawals were paused while trading stayed active, minimizing broader disruption. The attacker converted the $1M USDT into ETH, then moved $7.3M worth of assets into a fresh address. On BNB Chain, 5 BTCB was received from a Woo wallet, swapped to BNB, then forwarded to another new address. ALERT Our system has detected multiple suspicious transactions with an estimated loss of more than $12M involving @_WOO_X among $BTC , $ETH , $BNB , and $ARB networks.

Woo X says many of the withdrawals were blocked mid-flight, and every affected user has been contacted. Full reimbursement is in progress. Woo X‚Äôs official statement confirmed 9 accounts were impacted. We're currently investigating a contained incident that occurred on WOO X earlier today While user funds and trading are unaffected, withdrawals have been temporarily paused while we complete the investigation. Stay tuned to this account for updates: https://t.co/qWc9cDhn2z ‚Äî WOO X (@_WOO_X) July 24, 2025 What‚Äôs the Deal With Hot Wallets? Hot wallets are essential for fast deposits, trades, and withdrawals. But there‚Äôs a catch,they‚Äôre always online. That convenience? It‚Äôs also exposure. Think of it like keeping your wallet on the kitchen table with the window open. Sure, it‚Äôs handy. But one slip, and someone‚Äôs in. Crypto exchanges often juggle hot wallets across multiple chains,BTC, ETH, BNB, you name it. So if one wallet is compromised, attackers can leap across networks quickly. Woo X Hack by the Numbers BTC: Funds traced via wrapped $BTCB ETH: Received $1M via USDT swap BNB: Converted from BTCB post-breach ARB & TRX: Included in chain activity 3 Quick Tips to Stay Safe Even if you‚Äôre not on Woo X, this is your wake-up call. Here‚Äôs your crypto hygiene checklist: 1. Rotate API Keys If you‚Äôve connected bots or tools to your exchange account, rotate those keys regularly. Keep access tight,read-only when possible. 2. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) This should be a no-brainer. Always use MFA. And don‚Äôt just use SMS,opt for app-based authentication or hardware keys. 3. Split Your Funds Never store your life savings in a hot wallet. Keep only what you need for active trading. Cold wallets or self-custody options like Ledger and Trezor exist for a reason.

Lookonchain reported Friday that the digital asset firm initially sent over 10,000 Bitcoin to exchanges in the past 8 hours. The transfer comes after Galaxy Digital received more than 80,000 Bitcoin from a Satoshi-era whale who had not accessed the funds for 14 years.

Bitcoin Sell-Off Worries Mount ‚Äì What Can Investors Expect Galaxy‚Äôs latest sell-off spree has weighed on the Bitcoin price. BTC suffered a sharp correction over the past 24 hours, falling by over 2% in the past 24 hours to $115,600 after being rejected at the $119,000 resistance level. The largest cryptocurrency is now trading at $115,444 at press time, with a 4.21% drop since last week, according to CoinMarketCap data . The price drop has rattled markets and raised fresh questions about whether BTC can maintain its upward momentum. Analysts believe this behavior indicates short-term bearish sentiment. If Galaxy Digital or its affiliated wallet continues this pace, more downside could follow. Market watchers noted that a breakdown below $114,000 could trigger more downside pressure.

2025-07-25T06:18:42,"FTX to Resume Creditor Payouts Sept 30 , $1.9B Approved for Next Round","FTX is preparing to distribute another major tranche of creditor repayments. Bankruptcy court just greenlit $1.9B in disbursements, with payments scheduled to begin on September 30. Claimants must be verified before the August 15 record date to be eligible. This marks round three of FTX‚Äôs massive repayment plan , a multibillion-dollar effort to make users whole following the exchange‚Äôs 2022 collapse. The approved distribution brings FTX‚Äôs total repayments to $8.1B, following previous disbursements of $1.2B in February and $5B in May. The target? Between $14.7B and $16.5B in total payouts. Recoveries vary depending on the type of claim and how assets were valued during the bankruptcy. Roughly 98% of creditors are expected to receive at least 119% of the value of their original claims. That‚Äôs based on pricing from the date FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022. It‚Äôs an unexpected twist in what was once viewed as a hopeless case. After FTX‚Äôs collapse, many assumed pennies on the dollar , if anything. Now, most former users stand to gain, not just recover. Who Gets Paid , and How FTX has named BitGo, Kraken, and Payoneer as the official distribution platforms. To receive payouts, users need to complete KYC checks and submit tax documents. Geopolitical restrictions apply. Users in China, Russia, Ukraine, and Pakistan may face delays or additional compliance checks. No further detail was given on how long these hold-ups might last. FTX has warned that failing to complete all necessary verifications may result in delays or forfeiture of claims. FTX has announced plans to begin distributing the next batch of creditor claims on September 30. The bankruptcy court has released $1.9B for this purpose. The record date for claim holders is set for August 15. So far, #FTX has distributed $6.2B to former customers across two‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/66yYfq2XOw ‚Äî Mpost Media Group (@mpost_io) July 24, 2025 FTX Payout Structure & Court Approval The repayment effort stems from a carefully structured bankruptcy proceeding in Delaware court. The court‚Äôs latest approval to unlock $1.9B comes as part of the third phase in FTX‚Äôs sequential repayment strategy. While exact amounts per claimant will vary, the estate has emphasized fairness and speed in execution. What makes this case unique is the surplus most retail users are now expected to receive , a stark contrast to most crypto bankruptcies. Institutional lenders and larger creditors may receive lower recovery percentages, depending on specific assets held and contract terms. Asset Valuation: The Key Factor All payouts are based on the value of assets at the time of the bankruptcy filing , not current prices. So even if a user held Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH), or Bitcoin (BTC), they‚Äôll receive fiat-equivalent based on Nov 2022 prices, not today‚Äôs market value. This clause is both a win and a loss: For many, it‚Äôs still a major recovery. But for some, especially those who held long-term assets, the upside potential has been lost. The August 15 record date is critical. Anyone without verified claims by that date will not be included in the upcoming batch of payments. FTX has not released dates for subsequent distributions, but insiders suggest a final major round could arrive by early 2026, depending on asset liquidation progress and regulatory clearance. Token Data Snapshot FTT (FTX Token) is currently trading at $1.42, with a market cap of $466M. While FTT is no longer relevant to the bankruptcy estate‚Äôs recovery, the token still attracts speculation , especially from traders anticipating a relaunch or restructuring. With over $6.2B already distributed and another $1.9B unlocked, FTX is rewriting the playbook for post-collapse recovery. While not without delays and restrictions, the case stands out as one of the rare crypto bankruptcies where users aren‚Äôt just made whole , they‚Äôre walking away with gains.

With large firms like BitMine, Sharplink Gaming , and Ether Machine collectively holding over 1.3 million ETH, a potential supply crunch may be in the making. Novogratz told CNBC that this surge in institutional interest could be the ‚Äúsecret sauce‚Äù pushing Ether past $4,000 in the coming months. Interestingly, raising the bull vibes, firms like BitMine, Sharplink Gaming, and The Ether Machine now hold billions in ETH in their treasuries. ETH is increasingly seen as a strategic reserve and yield-bearing asset, reshaping its narrative from utility token to digital collateral. Strong Hands, Limited Supply With Ethereum trading around $3,618, Novogratz feels ETH is ‚Äúdestined‚Äù to knock on the $4,000 door and possibly break into price discovery if it does. He emphasized that there‚Äôs not much ETH supply floating around, making it easier for big purchases to move the price. The consistent accumulation by companies, even those preparing to list publicly like Ether Machine, could trigger a squeeze and send prices flying. ETH Gaining Ground on Bitcoin Not only is ETH catching up in price, it‚Äôs also outperforming Bitcoin on the charts. The ETH/BTC ratio has jumped over 36% in the past month, signaling stronger momentum. While Novogratz remains bullish on Bitcoin long-term, he thinks Ethereum might lead the race shortly, especially with narratives around ETH utility and staking gaining ground. Bitcoin Still Looks Strong Despite favoring ETH in the short term, Novogratz isn‚Äôt sidelining Bitcoin. He sees $150,000 as a reasonable target for BTC , driven by continued bullish sentiment. Bitfinex analysts echoed that with a $136,000 short-term target, though they caution it could mark a temporary peak. However, Novogratz warned that if U.S. interest rate policy shifts unexpectedly, especially under a Trump-led administration, his bullish outlook might need revisiting. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Dominance Spikes as Altcoin Season Index Crashes ‚Äì Is a Sell-off Coming? , ETH $4K, Possible?

Stablecoin reserves in the Ethereum ecosystem have jumped to $131 billion, double the amount from just a few months ago. Total value locked (TVL) also climbed to 22.2M ETH, suggesting growing DeFi activity. Meanwhile, the market cap-to- stablecoin ratio has dropped significantly to 3.4x, suggesting ETH may be undervalued relative to available liquidity. Ethereum is being loaded up by institutional buyers, and with limited supply, a break above $4K looks likely, says Novogratz. While Bitcoin remains solid, ETH could take the spotlight over the next few months. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!
