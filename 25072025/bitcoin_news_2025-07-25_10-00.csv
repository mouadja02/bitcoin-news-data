2025-07-25T07:55:09,"Galaxy Digital Withdrawal: Unveiling Crucial Moves Amidst Bitcoin’s Sell-Off","BitcoinWorld Galaxy Digital Withdrawal: Unveiling Crucial Moves Amidst Bitcoin’s Sell-Off The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic landscape, often characterized by rapid shifts and intriguing maneuvers by major players. Recently, the crypto world has been abuzz with news surrounding a significant Galaxy Digital withdrawal . This event, involving hundreds of millions in USDT, has naturally sparked intense discussion and speculation, especially as it unfolds against the backdrop of a continued Bitcoin (BTC) sell-off. What exactly does this move signify for the market, and what can we learn from the actions of institutional giants like Galaxy Digital? What Triggered This Crucial Galaxy Digital Withdrawal? Earlier in the day, the crypto financial firm Galaxy Digital made headlines for depositing a substantial amount of Bitcoin to various centralized exchanges. This action alone often raises eyebrows, as large deposits to exchanges can sometimes precede selling activity, increasing supply and potentially downward pressure on prices. However, the plot thickened significantly just hours later. According to diligent on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X , Galaxy Digital proceeded to withdraw a staggering $456 million in USDT (Tether) from three major exchanges: Binance, Bybit, and OKX, all within a tight 30-minute window. This rapid sequence of events – depositing BTC and then withdrawing a massive sum of stablecoin – is not merely coincidental. It suggests a deliberate, strategic play by a sophisticated institutional entity. For context, Galaxy Digital currently holds a significant 18,504 BTC, valued at approximately $2.13 billion. This substantial holding underscores their deep involvement in the Bitcoin ecosystem, making their every move a subject of intense scrutiny. The Galaxy Digital withdrawal of such a large USDT sum immediately raises questions about their intentions: Is it a preparation for future investments, a rebalancing of their portfolio, or something else entirely? Decoding Galaxy Digital’s Strategy: Is This a Bitcoin Sell-Off Signal? When a major player like Galaxy Digital makes a move of this magnitude, it rarely happens without strategic intent. The Galaxy Digital withdrawal of $456 million in USDT, especially after depositing BTC, could be interpreted in several ways, each with different implications for the ongoing Bitcoin sell-off: Preparing for Dip Buying: One common strategy during a sell-off is to accumulate stablecoins to be ready to buy assets at lower prices. By withdrawing USDT, Galaxy Digital might be positioning itself to acquire more BTC or other cryptocurrencies if prices continue to drop, viewing the current downturn as a buying opportunity. Operational Liquidity: Large firms require substantial liquidity for various operations, including investments, partnerships, or even covering short-term liabilities. The USDT withdrawal could simply be a move to consolidate funds for immediate use outside of exchange trading, rather than a direct market signal. Hedging or Risk Management: In volatile markets, firms often engage in hedging strategies to protect their existing holdings. While less common to withdraw stablecoins for this, it could be part of a broader, complex financial maneuver to mitigate risk associated with their Bitcoin exposure. Market Sentiment Signal: Regardless of their direct intent, such a large Galaxy Digital withdrawal inherently sends a signal. Some might interpret it as a lack of immediate confidence in the market’s upward trajectory, prompting them to hold stable assets rather than volatile ones. However, it’s crucial not to jump to conclusions based on a single data point. Understanding the full picture requires looking beyond just this one transaction and considering Galaxy Digital’s overall financial health and market outlook. The Broader Bitcoin Sell-Off: What’s Driving the Market Downturn? The Galaxy Digital withdrawal takes place within a broader context of a sustained Bitcoin sell-off. While specific institutional actions contribute to market sentiment, several macroeconomic and industry-specific factors are typically at play during such downturns: Key Drivers of the Current Bitcoin Sell-Off: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic uncertainties, including persistent inflation, rising interest rates, and geopolitical tensions, often lead investors to pull out of riskier assets like cryptocurrencies and seek safer havens. Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of clear, consistent global cryptocurrency regulations continues to be a significant concern for institutional investors. Ambiguity can deter new capital inflows and encourage existing players to de-risk. Profit-Taking: After periods of significant price appreciation, some long-term holders and miners might decide to take profits, leading to increased selling pressure. This is a natural cycle in any asset market. Liquidations: In highly leveraged markets, even small price drops can trigger cascading liquidations, forcing traders to sell their assets to cover margin calls, thereby exacerbating the sell-off. FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt): Negative news, rumors, or even large, unexplained transactions like the Galaxy Digital withdrawal can contribute to a climate of fear, prompting retail investors to panic sell. It’s a confluence of these factors that creates a challenging environment for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, making every significant transaction by a firm like Galaxy Digital even more impactful on public perception. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights for Investors Amidst a Galaxy Digital Withdrawal For individual investors, navigating a volatile market, especially when large institutional moves like the Galaxy Digital withdrawal occur, can be daunting. Here are some actionable insights to consider: 1. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): While on-chain data and analyst reports are valuable, always verify information and understand the context. Don’t base investment decisions solely on single events or sensational headlines. 2. Understand Risk Management: Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across different assets to mitigate risk. Position Sizing: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Avoid over-leveraging. Stop-Loss Orders: Consider using stop-loss orders to limit potential losses during sharp market downturns. 3. Adopt a Long-Term Perspective: Cryptocurrency markets are known for their extreme volatility. Focusing on the long-term fundamentals of projects rather than short-term price fluctuations can help weather market storms. 4. Monitor On-Chain Data (with Caution): While intriguing, on-chain data requires expertise to interpret correctly. A large Galaxy Digital withdrawal , for example, could have multiple explanations. Use it as one piece of the puzzle, not the whole picture. 5. Avoid Emotional Decisions: Fear and greed are powerful drivers in crypto. Stick to your investment plan and avoid making impulsive decisions based on market FUD or FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). The Power of On-Chain Analytics: Peeking Behind the Curtain of a Galaxy Digital Withdrawal The ability to track large transactions, like the Galaxy Digital withdrawal , is a testament to the transparency of blockchain technology. On-chain analytics has become an indispensable tool for understanding market dynamics and institutional behavior. On-chain analysts, like @ai_9684xtpa, meticulously monitor public blockchain ledgers to identify significant movements of assets between wallets, exchanges, and other entities. This provides a level of transparency that is often unmatched in traditional finance. For instance, by observing a large deposit of BTC to exchanges followed by a massive USDT withdrawal, analysts can infer potential strategies. Is the firm preparing to sell BTC and hold stablecoins? Or are they accumulating stablecoins from a previous sale to deploy elsewhere? The beauty of on-chain data is that it provides the raw facts, though the interpretation still requires expertise and an understanding of market context. While the exact motivations behind every large transaction remain proprietary, the visibility offered by on-chain data empowers the community to gain insights into the flows of capital, making events like the Galaxy Digital withdrawal visible to the public and fostering more informed discussions. Conclusion The recent Galaxy Digital withdrawal of $456 million in USDT, set against the backdrop of an ongoing Bitcoin sell-off, is a prime example of the complex and interconnected nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the exact strategic intent behind Galaxy Digital’s move remains speculative, it highlights the importance of institutional actions in shaping market sentiment and liquidity. Whether it signals preparation for future investments, operational rebalancing, or a more cautious stance, such large transactions underscore the dynamic interplay between major players and broader market trends. For investors, this event serves as a crucial reminder to stay informed, practice sound risk management, and avoid impulsive decisions in the face of market volatility. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Galaxy Digital? A1: Galaxy Digital is a diversified financial services and investment management company focused on the digital asset, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology sectors. Founded by Mike Novogratz, it provides services such as asset management, trading, and advisory for institutional clients. Q2: Why is a large USDT withdrawal by Galaxy Digital significant? A2: A large Galaxy Digital withdrawal of stablecoins like USDT is significant because it indicates a major movement of capital by an institutional player. It can signal strategic rebalancing, preparation for future investments (like buying dips), or changes in liquidity management, all of which can influence market sentiment. Q3: How does this Galaxy Digital withdrawal relate to a Bitcoin sell-off? A3: The withdrawal occurred amid a continued Bitcoin sell-off, suggesting that Galaxy Digital’s move might be a response to or part of their strategy during this market downturn. It could be a way to accumulate stablecoin liquidity to potentially buy BTC at lower prices, or it might reflect a more cautious approach to the market’s current state. Q4: Should I be worried about my Bitcoin holdings because of this news? A4: While significant, a single transaction by an institution doesn’t necessarily dictate the entire market’s future. It’s crucial to understand the broader market context, your own risk tolerance, and investment goals. This event highlights market dynamics but shouldn’t be the sole reason for panic selling. Always do your own research. Q5: What is on-chain analysis and how does it help understand events like this? A5: On-chain analysis involves examining data directly from public blockchain ledgers to track transactions, wallet activity, and asset flows. It helps analysts identify large movements by entities like Galaxy Digital, providing transparency into institutional behavior and market liquidity, which can inform investment decisions.

Top Analyst Warns Of Sharp Fall appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is once again testing the patience of crypto traders. As a popular crypto analyst, Captain Faibik has shared a fresh warning about Bitcoin’s current price pattern. He says Bitcoin is stuck inside a Rising Wedge pattern and believes that BTC could soon drop below $100,000 if signs play out. So, is a big drop coming? Bitcoin Whales Selling BTC Recently, Bitcoin’s price fell from its key support level of $118,000 and is now trading around $115,710, down about 1.9% for the day. One of the big reasons for this drop is that whales are once again shaking the market. Meanwhile, Galaxy Digital reportedly sold 10,000 BTC worth about $1.18 billion and also withdrew $370 million USDT from exchanges. This large sell-off pushed Bitcoin down by 3% in just one hour and caused around $144 million in liquidations , mostly long positions. When big holders sell during thin trading days, prices can slide fast. Key Level to Watch: $113,000 According to Captain Faibik, Bitcoin must stay above $113,000 to avoid a bigger drop. If it closes below this level, the price could break down quickly. Many traders watch this level closely because it shows if the buying strength is still strong or getting weaker. $BTC is on the verge of breaking down from its Rising Wedge..!! A daily close below 113k would confirm the Breakdown, Potentially triggering a Correction.. Still Waiting for confirmation before taking any action.. #Crypto #Bitcoin #BTC https://t.co/KZctibiLlZ pic.twitter.com/qon77TXtDH — Captain Faibik (@CryptoFaibik) July 25, 2025 Faibik is not rushing to trade yet. He wants to see a clear daily close below $113,000 before making any move. This shows how careful smart traders are, they wait for solid signs instead of guessing what will happen next. A Trap for Late Buyers? Along with the wedge, Faibik also sees a Bearish PO3 on the daily chart. This is just another sign that the market could be tricking late buyers. Big players might push the price up just enough to trap people who buy late, and then drag the price down, sweeping away their money. Even though daily trading volume rose 23% to $87.46 billion , it mostly shows whales taking profit and shaking out weak hands. New traders who jump in now might get caught in a trap for new traders who jump in too late might. How Low Could Bitcoin Fall? If Bitcoin breaks below the wedge, Faibik thinks the price could fall towards the $95,000 to $98,000 range . For some, this drop might look scary. But for patient traders, it could be a chance to buy Bitcoin at a cheaper price before the next move up.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-price-to-drop-below-100k-top-analyst-warns-of-sharp-fall/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|USDT","News",cryptocompare

According to Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas, the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) now holds over $10 billion in assets , reaching that milestone in just 251 days. Only BlackRock’s own IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC spot Bitcoin ETFs got there faster. What’s remarkable is that half of ETHA’s current assets— $5 billion—came in within just 10 days , a surge Balchunas compared to a “God candle,” a term for rapid, explosive price movement. ETHA is now consistently among the top 5 ETFs for net inflows , both weekly and monthly, signaling a strong shift in investor interest from Bitcoin to Ethereum. ETH’s performance supports this trend. The asset has gained over 50% in the past week and more than doubled since mid-May. At the same time, Bitcoin’s 30-day gain sits at just 24%. That momentum has extended across other ETH ETFs too, with 14 straight days of inflows totaling nearly $4 billion. July 16 marked the largest single-day inflow ever for ETH ETFs at $726.7 million. Ethereum’s growing popularity isn’t just institutional. On-chain activity is heating up as well, with $500 million in stablecoins added to the network in one day and a new record of 24.69 million daily transactions. As Ethereum approaches its 10-year anniversary, the rally in price, network usage, and ETF adoption points to a bright and rapidly evolving future for the second-largest crypto asset.",coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/ethereum-etf-soars-as-blackrock-s-etha-hits-10b-in-record-time,"ETH|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS","",cryptocompare

This move also broke through the key ascending trendline support that had held since early July, raising concerns of a potential trend shift as momentum stalls. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin price action had been coiling inside a descending parallel channel since mid-July. The recent breakdown below $116,000 suggests the bears are attempting to seize control after multiple failed bullish attempts near the $118,800 to $119,200 resistance area. Price has now deviated below the lower bound of the channel and closed under the dotted ascending trendline that previously supported every major bounce this month. This breakdown appears significant, especially given the rejection from the midline of the channel earlier this week and the sharp bearish engulfing candle printed after that. If the daily close confirms below $115,300, sellers may push price into deeper liquidity pockets toward $113,000 or lower.

While the launch date appears as September 30 in CoinMarketCap data, the images shared by Monad included September 29 due to the time difference. Monad, which will launch with a total supply of 100 billion, will integrate with decentralized applications (dApps) such as Uniswap, Magic Eden, and OpenSea at launch. In terms of wallet support, it will be compatible with OKX, Backpack, MetaMask, Rabby, and other popular wallets.

2025-07-25T07:30:46,"Ripple Co-Founder Offloads $200 Million XRP In 10 Days—What’s Left?","Ripple’s executive chairman Chris Larsen has accelerated his long-running distribution of personal XRP, moving the equivalent of roughly $200 million since 17 July, according to public ledger data highlighted by on-chain investigator ZachXBT. “Since July 17 an address linked to Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen transferred out 50 M XRP (≈ $175 M) to four addresses. ≈ $140 M ended up at exchanges,” the pseudonymous investigator wrote on X, appending the destination addresses for the largest tranches. Subsequent movements flagged by analysts at CryptoQuant lifted the 10-day tally to about 57 million XRP, taking dollar outflows past the $200 million mark at Thursday’s average price. The transfers landed while XRP was retreating from last week’s local peak of $3.66. On Thursday, the token had slipped to an intraday low near $2.95, before stabilising above $3.000. Although correlation is not causation, critics seized on the timing. On-chain analyst JA Maartun told his followers that Larsen “just dumped ≈ $200 M worth of XRP in the past 10 days… You’re the exit liquidity. Think twice.” Blockchain forensics firm Lookonchain, corroborating ZachXBT’s figures , estimates that wallets attributed to Larsen still control about 2.81 billion XRP. In a reply on X, ZachXBT confirmed that “wallets linked to Chris Larsen only have another 2.81 B+ XRP ($8.4 B) left,” signalling that even after the recent sell-down Larsen remains one of the market’s single largest potential sources of supply. The Original Ripple “Founders Reward” Court filings in the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s 2020 enforcement action against Ripple describe the initial allocation with rare precision. When the XRP Ledger was finalised in December 2012, its fixed supply of 100 billion tokens was divided so that 80 billion went to Ripple and 20 billion to the three founders “as compensation.” Nine billion XRP went to Larsen and nine billion to fellow co-founder Jed McCaleb; two billion went to early engineer Arthur Britto. Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s current chief executive but not a founder, never received a “founders reward.” Instead, Ripple’s board granted him 500 million XRP as part of his elevation to CEO on 13 December 2016 and a further 250 million on 29 May 2019. By the time the SEC filed its complaint, 521 million of those tokens had been delivered, valued then at about $246 million. A December 2024 Forbes deep-dive put Larsen’s fortune at $9.2 billion, noting that “roughly half is still denominated in XRP.” Jed McCaleb , who finished liquidating his “Tacostand” wallets in 2022, is listed at $2.9 billion in the April 2025 Forbes Billionaires ranking. Arthur Britto’s wealth is notoriously opaque—he eschews publicity—but if he retained his full two-billion-token grant it would be worth about $6.2 billion at current prices. No credible publication has ventured a formal estimate. In March this year, Fox Business journalist Charles Gasparino estimated that “the net worth of Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO, is around $10 billion, making him one of the richest people in the country.” At press time, XRP traded at $3.11.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-co-founder-offloads-200-million-xrp-10-days/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO","XRP|Chris Larsen|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price",cryptocompare

Between July 14 and 20, Ethereum recorded $25.7 billion in spot trades, while Bitcoin followed slightly behind at $24.4 billion. This unexpected flip has sparked fresh speculation: is an altcoin season quietly brewing? Ethereum vs Bitcoin: Changing Market Dynamics Ethereum weekly spot volume surpassed Bitcoin's $ETH weekly spot volume hit $25.7B last week vs $BTC 's $24.4B. It happened for the first time in over a year. Is ETH’s performance a sign that altseason is near? Covered in the thread pic.twitter.com/xS1odcdYbF — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) July 24, 2025 The trading landscape is shifting. Data from the past week shows Ethereum edging ahead of Bitcoin in spot volume, suggesting rising investor interest and market activity in ETH. While Ethereum’s price surged over 26% in the same period, supported by six consecutive green candles, Bitcoin dipped by 1.55%. This could point to a growing confidence in Ethereum’s ecosystem and a potential shift in market leadership at least temporarily. Ethereum ETF Inflows Gain Momentum ETF flows further strengthen Ethereum’s momentum. Between July 14 and 18, spot Ethereum ETFs saw inflows of over $2.18 billion, and since July 21, an additional $1.39 billion has poured in. In just one day, the market saw a fresh $231.2 million inflow. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs started strong with $2.37 billion in inflows between July 14 and 18, but have since faced outflows exceeding $285 million between July 21 and 23. The mixed flows raise questions about shifting investor preferences. Derivatives Market: High Interest, Rising Liquidations On July 22, Ethereum open interest reached a new all-time high of $28 billion. However, within 24 hours, around $150 million in ETH positions were liquidated, with over $111 million being long bets. This signals some short-term caution as Ethereum’s price dropped 3.87% from its recent peak of $3,860. Ethereum Exchange Reserves Are Shrinking Another bullish indicator? ETH is leaving exchanges. Data from CryptoQuant shows that Ethereum reserves across centralized exchanges have fallen by 3.46% since the start of the month, from over 20 million to roughly 19.32 million ETH. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why the Crypto Market is Down Today: BTC, ETH, XRP Lead the Drop? , This decline usually suggests that holders are moving their ETH into cold storage, confident about the asset’s long-term prospects and less inclined to sell. So, Is Altcoin Season Here? Despite all the positive signals, we’re not there yet. The Altseason Index has slipped from 62 to 48, showing that while Ethereum is gaining traction, the broader altcoin market hasn’t caught up. Ethereum is undeniably gaining ground with strong ETF flows, rising open interest, and declining exchange reserves. While these are classic signs that could precede an altcoin rally, we’re still in the waiting phase. Watch this space closely, a breakout may just be around the corner. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-25T07:15:49,"Monthly BTC and ETH options are expiring today","The monthly options expiry on Deribit added to the market volatility, as BTC moved down to the $115,000 range. While smaller than June’s expiry event, the market is still liquid and may affect spot prices. The options expiry on Deribit may add to the price pressure for BTC. The leading coin traded at $115,549.15, pressured closer to the level of maximum pain at $112,000. Deribit announced a total of $15.45B in options, down from June’s $17B. The monthly event is still considered significant, as the crypto market has not experienced a summer slump. The BTC options expiring have a notional value of $12.66B, while ETH expects a $2.75B expiry event. 🚨 Options Expiry Alert 🚨 Tomorrow, over $15.4B in BTC and ETH options are set to expire on Deribit. $BTC : $12.66B notional | Put/Call: 0.88 | Max Pain: $112K $ETH : $2.75B notional | Put/Call: 0.87 | Max Pain: $2,800 Last month’s H1 expiry hit $17B. This week’s is not far… pic.twitter.com/5nFSk7qDPg — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) July 24, 2025 While ETH maximum pain price at $2,800 is less probable, BTC may see last-minute pressure. For the past few months, both BTC and ETH have expired above their options maximum pain price. The put/call ratio signals a more moderate stance, though still retaining a bullish trend. Deribit has seen a faster accumulation of open interest, already building up over $37B for the quarter to date. At the end of Q2, the open interest at expiry was just $35B. BTC still trades in greed territory, with an index of 67. However, this does not preclude short-term price moves. Overall BTC volatility is near an all-time low, though the price still fluctuates between key levels. The BTC volatility index is down to 1.27%, with a brief spike during the July rally. BTC expects dip on extended long liquidations BTC may easily dip to the $114,000 range, where an accumulation of short positions may trigger an attack. Despite this, BTC retains its bullish factors, with a new accumulation of short positions all the way to $119,000 . Despite the complex trading, the end of the month has historically performed as a good entry point. BTC still expects a breakout to a new price range, despite temporary setbacks. ETH retains the $3,600 range, though the token saw the largest share of long liquidations in the past 24 hours. ETH is traded with more exuberance, with signs of being overheated. The market dominance of ETH expanded to 11.4% as more traders switched their attention, while BTC dominance sank to 59.6%. BTC and ETH had a drawdown mostly driven by long liquidations, ahead of the monthly options expiry. | Source: CoingGlass. In the past 24 hours, ETH was a leader of liquidations, with $152.13M in predominantly long positions. BTC saw $152.04 in long positions liquidated. BTC falls on signs of whale selling BTC also faces added pressure from spot selling. Despite the general accumulation trend, in the short term some whales are sending their coins to exchanges. Galaxy Digital, one of the intermediaries for both retail and institutional traders, has sent 11,910 BTC to multiple exchanges. 🚨 Is a BIG #BITCOIN SELL-OFF taking place? Over the past 9 hours, #GalaxyDigital deposited 11,910 $BTC ($1.39B) to multiple exchanges. These BTCs likely originated from the Bitcoin OG that offloaded 80,202 $BTC ($9.54B) at an average of $118,950 between July 15–18.

The spot sales originating from the Galaxy Digital wallet follows a recent reawakening of a wallet from 2011. The wallet moved 3,962 BTC, after making a test transaction. The old whale wallet received the typical messages of proving coin ownership, which have made other whales move their coins to new addresses and split them to avoid easy tracking.

The move south has harmed over-leveraged traders, with nearly 150,000 such market participants getting liquidated on a daily scale. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView The primary cryptocurrency remained in a relatively tight range between $117,000 and $120,000 for the past week, ever since it was pushed south from its latest all-time high of over $123,000. It challenged the upper boundary on a couple of occasions on Wednesday and Thursday, but to no avail. The latest rejection, which took place hours ago, was particularly painful as it drove BTC south to its lowest price tag since July 11 at $115,000. This violent correction appears to be at least partially related to Galaxy Digital’s decision to dump a substantial portion of its BTC stash. As reported by Lookonchain, the Novograz-spearheaded company first deposited 10,000 BTC (valued at $1.18 billion at the time) to exchanges before initiating withdrawals of USDT. Looks like #GalaxyDigital has already dumped the 10,000 $BTC ($1.18B)! Over the past 3 hours, they’ve withdrawn 370M $USDT from #OKX , #Binance , and #Bybit . Meanwhile, $BTC has dropped over 3% in the past 8 hours. https://t.co/SAD8JLS3TU pic.twitter.com/t0ETxWlw3s — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 25, 2025 In a follow-up, the analytics company said Galaxy deposited another 2,850 BTC ($330 million) to trading platforms, bringing the total to roughly $1.5 billion in bitcoin. This enhanced volatility has harmed traders using high levels of leverage, as shown by CoinGlass. On a daily scale, the total value of wrecked positions is up to $515 million, with BTC leading the pack ($143 million). The number of liquidated traders is over 140,000.

While bearish signals threaten the much-awaited altcoin season, VINE exploded from $0.03770 to $0.07945 within minutes. That led to an approximately 110% on its daily chart. The staggering surge materialized after Elon Musk sparked excitement in tech and crypto communities. The Tesla CEO confirmed plans to relaunch the short-form video app, Vine, leveraging artificial intelligence. Elon Musk @elonmusk · Follow We’re bringing back Vine, but in AI form 3:24 PM · Jul 24, 2025 0 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter A cultural icon is coming back Instagram Reels and TikTok have dominated the short-video industry lately. Nonetheless, the Vine app was a cultural representation of the early 2010s. Individuals used it to record and post 6-second videos. While this approach appeared limiting (at first), it quickly grabbed the attention of the creative online community. Vine became the birthplace of multiple viral trends and internet stars. Many internet personalities, including King Bach and Logan Paul, started their online influence on Vine. Notably, Vine launched in 2012 before X (formerly Twitter) acquired it. The video site laid the foundations of the current short-form video giants like Instagram Reels and TikTok as of its 2017 shutdown. Thus, nostalgia dominated the social media sector after Musk announced an AI-centric Vine revival. Crypto @CCrypto_real · Follow Replying to @elonmusk AI finally doing what matters — reviving culture. 3:28 PM · Jul 24, 2025 10 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter Despite the scarce details, the idea of integrating AI has sparked debates about the upcoming possibilities for creators. Individuals anticipate advanced features like enhanced user customization and auto-generated content. Musk’s post comes as artificial intelligence revolutionizes the financial industry without slowing momentum. Thus, VINE Token, inspired by the original Vine app, rallied following the announcement. Vine Coin explodes on hype VIEN has recorded stable gains since July 1 at $0.0275 amid broad market bull runs. However, its momentum faded on July 23, triggering notable declines from $0.04512 to yesterday’s low of $0.3574, driven by market-wide profit-booking. However, VINE rebounded after Elon Musk’s post, exploding by over 110% to Friday’s intraday high of $0.07945. It is trading at $0.05336 after retracing from today’s peak. VINE has witnessed its daily trading volume soar nearly 1,300%. Chart by Coinmarketcap That signals intensified trader activity as players capitalize on the existing volatility. Nevertheless, broad market sentiments remain vital in shaping the token’s direction. The global cryptocurrency market cap hovers at $3.8 trillion after losing 1.40% in the past day. It displays weakness as profit-taking kicked in after topping $4 trillion . Continued bearish activities could see VINE plunging further in the coming hours as bullish momentum fizzles. However, further updates from Elon Musk could catalyze more gains for the VINE coin. Meanwhile, analysts trust the current declines present dip-buying opportunities as the market signals swift bounce-backs. Michael van de Poppe anticipates another bullish breakout for altcoins as Bitcoin approaches a decisive moment. Michaël van de Poppe @CryptoMichNL · Follow Pretty solid day on the markets, as #Bitcoin is getting close to a decision & Gold continues to correct.Wouldn’t mind a bullish breakout and another leg upwards on #Altcoins .

2025-07-25T07:04:50,"Trader Says Bitcoin Still Looks Bullish, Warns He Would Be ‘Very Very Worried’ if This BTC Support Level Crumbles","A pseudonymous trader and analyst is outlining a key support level that could change his bullish thesis for Bitcoin ( BTC ). The trader and analyst pseudonymously known as DonAlt tells 67,000 subscribers of the TechnicalRoundup YouTube channel that Bitcoin is “still hilariously bullish.” DonAlt, however, says that the bullish case for Bitcoin could be invalidated if the crypto king falls by around 9% from the current level. “You just don’t want to necessarily lose $108,000. I think that’s like the first warning sign that something is wrong… But I’m not too worried just yet. I will be very, very worried if we lose this breakout [$108,000]. And then I’ll I’ll see if I change my positioning. But until then, you can barely see this pullback. It’s not even a pullback on the weekly time frame. There’s literally just like a consolidation.” According to the pseudonymous trader, one of the risk factors that Bitcoin faces comes from corporations purchasing the crypto king for the purpose of adding BTC to their treasuries. “If they’re done and they cannot buy anymore, that would be the end of the Ponzi, which would not be great, right. Because then I think that would basically nuke us. So that’s the risk. I think it’s a real risk and it’s never been riskier in that regard. It’s just basically the reward that you get if you’re right and bullish, kind of equals that out. But it is, don’t get me wrong, like I think it’s a dangerous spot that we’re in. It gets harder and harder to hold, basically.” Bitcoin is trading at $118,090 at time of writing, up by around 13% over the past 30 days.
