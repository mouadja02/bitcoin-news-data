2025-07-25T01:00:24,"Market Top or Just a Pause? Analysts Weigh in on Bitcoin‚Äôs Quiet Zone","Bitcoin continues to consolidate just below the $120,000 mark, exhibiting restrained momentum despite previous rallies that pushed it to all-time highs above $123,000. Over the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency has fluctuated between a low of $117,422 and a high of $119,197, ultimately trading at $118,578 at the time of writing. While price movement has remained relatively stable, on-chain indicators suggest that broader market sentiment is still in a transitional phase, with neither excessive enthusiasm nor panic selling present among investors. Related Reading: Are Traders Walking Into a Bitcoin Bull Trap at $118K? Here‚Äôs What the Data Shows Bitcoin Market Signals Suggest Ongoing Expansion Phase A recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Gaah highlights a key development in the Index Bitcoin Cycle Indicators (IBCI), a composite tool used to track phases in Bitcoin‚Äôs market cycle. According to Gaah, the IBCI has returned to the ‚ÄúDistribution‚Äù zone, an area historically associated with the late stages of a bull market. However, this return is moderate, as the index has reached only 80% of the zone‚Äôs upper boundary, falling short of the full saturation levels typically observed at major market peaks. The IBCI‚Äôs moderate level indicates that Bitcoin is in an expansionary stage, but without the typical signs of overheating. Gaah noted that two critical components of the IBCI, the Puell Multiple and the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH-SOPR), remain below their midpoint levels. This suggests that short-term speculation and aggressive profit-taking, often seen in late-stage bull markets, have not yet fully emerged in the current cycle. As a result, while caution may be warranted, the broader trend does not yet resemble a typical market top. The Puell Multiple, in particular, continues to hover near the ‚ÄúDiscount‚Äù range, indicating that miner profitability remains moderate even with Bitcoin‚Äôs recent all-time high. This points to a valuation structure where network participants have not yet entered the excess phase that typically precedes a market correction. Gaah emphasized that the current state of the IBCI reflects underlying market strength supported by fundamentals, not speculative fervor. However, he also warned that the market is in a high-risk correction zone in the short term and should be monitored closely for shifts in retail behavior and miner activity. Short-Term Holders Offer Support Around Realized Price Adding to the discussion, another CryptoQuant analyst, Amr Taha, observed that Bitcoin has maintained price stability near the realized price of the UTXO Age Band for 1-day to 1-week holders, currently around $118,300. This metric is often interpreted as a dynamic support level that reflects the average cost basis for recent buyers. According to Taha, the absence of capitulation among newer holders implies that recent market entrants remain confident, reinforcing the current price range as a psychological and technical support zone.

Instead, current metrics imply a market that continues to expand at a measured pace, with room for potential upside if fundamentals remain intact.

2025-07-25T01:00:24,"Crypto Sector Lost $3.1 Billion to Hacks in Q1 2025, Says Hacken Report","The cryptocurrency industry has witnessed over $3.1 billion in losses during the first half of 2025, already surpassing the total for all of 2024. According to a report published by blockchain security firm Hacken, the figure reflects persistent systemic vulnerabilities across both decentralized and centralized finance platforms, driven by outdated codebases, access-control flaws , and the growing complexity introduced by artificial intelligence integrations. Access-control exploits remain the leading cause of financial damage, contributing roughly 59% of the total losses, while smart-contract bugs accounted for around $273 million. Although the $1.5 billion Bybit incident in February stands out as a major event, it does not obscure the fact that the industry continues to face broad security shortcomings . Hacken‚Äôs forensic team observed a recurring theme in 2025: human and procedural errors are now a more frequent point of attack than cryptographic weaknesses. Legacy Infrastructure and Operational Vulnerabilities Hacken‚Äôs head of forensics, Yehor Rudytsia, noted that older codebases have remained active targets for attackers, with the GMX v1 platform being a key example. The protocol‚Äôs outdated structure began facing exploitation in Q3 2025. ‚ÄúProjects have to care about their old or legacy codebase if it was not stopped from operating completely,‚Äù Rudytsia said, emphasizing the risks of leaving older protocols exposed. Operational vulnerabilities have also played a prominent role, accounting for approximately $1.83 billion in losses across both DeFi and CeFi. The most notable case was the $223 million breach on Cetus, a DeFi platform, during Q2. The exploit was traced to an overflow check vulnerability in its liquidity calculations. Using a flash loan, the attacker opened hundreds of small positions across 264 pools. Hacken analysts suggested that real-time TVL monitoring with automatic pause mechanisms might have prevented up to 90% of the funds from being drained. AI and Insecure APIs Add Complexity to Web3 Security The incorporation of artificial intelligence tools into Web3 projects has added another layer of complexity to the security environment. According to Hacken‚Äôs report, there has been a 1,025% increase in AI-related attacks compared to 2023. Nearly 99% of these incidents involved insecure APIs, making them one of the most exploited attack surfaces today. As of mid-2025, 34% of Web3 projects are using AI agents in live environments, increasing their exposure to risks such as model hallucination, prompt injection, and data poisoning. Hacken also highlighted that existing security standards like ISO/IEC 27001 and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework are not yet adequately equipped to handle these AI-specific threats. The report called for updated governance and risk models that can better account for evolving vulnerabilities in smart systems. With more sophisticated threat vectors emerging and attackers increasingly relying on automation and social engineering, the demand for proactive and adaptive security mechanisms in the crypto sector has grown substantially.
