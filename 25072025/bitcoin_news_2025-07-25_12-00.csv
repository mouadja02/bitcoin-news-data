2025-07-25T09:55:11,"STX Token: Crucial Bithumb Suspension Announced for Stacks Network Upgrade","BitcoinWorld STX Token: Crucial Bithumb Suspension Announced for Stacks Network Upgrade The dynamic world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, with continuous updates and enhancements shaping the digital asset landscape. For investors and enthusiasts, staying informed about these developments is not just beneficial, but absolutely essential. A significant announcement from South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb has recently captured the attention of the STX token community, signaling an important, albeit temporary, change in how users can interact with their holdings. This move underscores the ongoing commitment to improving blockchain infrastructure and ensuring a robust, secure environment for digital assets. Why is Bithumb Suspending STX Token Transactions? Bithumb, a prominent player in the South Korean crypto exchange arena, has officially announced a temporary halt to deposits and withdrawals of the STX token . This suspension is scheduled to commence at 03:00 UTC on July 29. The primary reason behind this measure is to provide full support for the upcoming Stacks network upgrade. Network upgrades are fundamental to the health and evolution of any blockchain. They are designed to introduce new features, enhance security protocols, improve scalability, and fix any existing bugs, ultimately making the network more efficient and reliable. For exchanges like Bithumb, suspending transactions during such critical periods is a standard and necessary practice to: Ensure Data Integrity: It prevents any potential loss or corruption of user funds and transaction data during the upgrade process. Prevent Transaction Issues: Transactions initiated during an upgrade might not be processed correctly or could lead to unforeseen complications. Facilitate Smooth Transition: It allows the exchange to seamlessly adapt its systems to the new network specifications without disruption to user assets. This proactive step by Bithumb highlights their commitment to safeguarding user assets and ensuring a smooth transition for the STX token on their platform. Understanding the Stacks Network and the Role of STX Token To fully grasp the significance of this suspension, it’s important to understand what the Stacks network is and the integral role the STX token plays within it. Stacks is a unique Layer-1 blockchain that aims to bring smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) to Bitcoin, without modifying Bitcoin itself. It extends Bitcoin’s security and stability to a broader range of functionalities, effectively unlocking Bitcoin as a programmable base layer for Web3. The STX token is the native cryptocurrency of the Stacks network. It serves multiple crucial purposes: Transaction Fees: Users pay transaction fees on the Stacks network using STX. Stacking: STX holders can ‘Stack’ their tokens to earn Bitcoin (BTC) rewards, participating in the network’s consensus mechanism (Proof of Transfer). Governance: STX holders can participate in the governance of the Stacks ecosystem, voting on proposals that shape the network’s future. The upcoming network upgrade is poised to enhance these functionalities, potentially leading to a more robust, efficient, and feature-rich Stacks ecosystem, which in turn could positively impact the utility and demand for the STX token . Crucial Steps for STX Token Holders: What You Need to Do For anyone holding or planning to transact with STX token on Bithumb, immediate action is advised. The suspension will take effect promptly at 03:00 UTC on July 29. To avoid any inconvenience or potential issues, users are strongly encouraged to: Complete All Transactions: Ensure all necessary deposits and withdrawals of STX token are finalized well before the specified deadline. Any transactions initiated after this time may not be processed and could potentially be lost or delayed indefinitely until services resume. Monitor Official Announcements: Keep a close watch on Bithumb’s official website and communication channels for updates regarding the resumption of STX token deposit and withdrawal services. The duration of the suspension will depend on the successful completion and verification of the Stacks network upgrade. Consider Alternative Storage: If you plan to hold your STX token for an extended period and wish to maintain full control during the suspension, consider withdrawing your tokens to a private, self-custody wallet that supports the Stacks network. Proactive management of your assets during such periods is a hallmark of a responsible crypto investor. By taking these steps, you can ensure your STX token holdings remain secure and accessible when services are restored. The Broader Impact of Network Upgrades on STX Token and Beyond Network upgrades, while sometimes requiring temporary service suspensions, are vital for the long-term health and competitiveness of any blockchain. For the STX token and the Stacks network, this upgrade signifies a commitment to innovation and improvement. Such enhancements contribute to: Enhanced Security: Patches for vulnerabilities and stronger cryptographic measures protect user assets and network integrity. Improved Scalability: Upgrades often increase transaction throughput and reduce fees, making the network more efficient and user-friendly. New Features and Functionality: They can unlock new use cases, developer tools, and capabilities, fostering growth within the ecosystem. Long-Term Viability: Regular upgrades demonstrate a project’s active development and adaptability, which are critical for attracting new users and investors, ultimately supporting the value proposition of assets like the STX token . This event also highlights the crucial role crypto exchanges play in facilitating these transitions. By coordinating with blockchain projects, exchanges ensure that their platforms remain compatible and secure, thereby maintaining user trust and supporting the broader crypto ecosystem’s growth. It’s a testament to the collaborative nature of the decentralized world, where every component, from the core protocol to the user-facing exchange, works in concert to advance the technology. Navigating Temporary Disruptions: A Common Practice in Crypto For those new to the cryptocurrency space, a suspension of deposits and withdrawals might seem alarming. However, it’s a relatively common and necessary practice for exchanges when a blockchain undergoes a significant network upgrade or hard fork. These temporary disruptions are not a sign of instability but rather a prudent measure to ensure the safety and integrity of user funds. Think of it like scheduled maintenance for a critical piece of infrastructure – it’s done to prevent bigger problems down the line and to ensure the system operates at its optimal level. The transparency of exchanges like Bithumb in announcing these suspensions well in advance allows users to plan accordingly. It reinforces the importance of staying connected to official news channels and understanding the operational procedures of the platforms you use. This approach fosters a more informed and resilient crypto community, where users are prepared for the dynamic nature of digital asset management. Summary: Be Prepared for the STX Token Suspension In conclusion, Bithumb’s announcement regarding the temporary suspension of STX token deposits and withdrawals on July 29, 03:00 UTC, is a crucial step in supporting the upcoming Stacks network upgrade. This measure is designed to protect user assets and ensure a seamless transition to a more robust and efficient Stacks blockchain. For all STX token holders on Bithumb, the key takeaway is to complete any necessary transactions before the deadline and to stay updated on Bithumb’s official communications for the resumption of services. Embrace these moments of necessary change as opportunities for growth and improvement within the exciting world of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

2025-07-25T09:45:23,"R. Kiyosaki warns ETFs are like ‘having a picture of a gun’","Robert Kiyosaki , American entrepreneur and writer, is once again urging investors to be cautious when exploring investment opportunities. Namely, in a July 25 post on X, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad noted the limits of exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ), acknowledging their usefulness yet recommending more tangible assets. According to Kiyosaki, investment funds make the lives of average investors easier, likely alluding to their hands-off nature, but they are no substitute for holding the real thing, being, as he calls them, “paper assets.” “ETFs make investing easier for the average investor… so I do recommend them.… Yet an ETF is like having a picture of a gun for personal defense.” Gold , silver , and Bitcoin ETFs are all accessible options, the writer notes, especially in times of crisis, but only if you “know the differences, and how to use them.” BEWARE of PAPER I realize ETFs make investing easier for the average investor….so I do recommend ETFs for the average investor. Yet I extend these words of caution: For the average investor I recommend: Gold ETFs Silver ETFs Bitcoin ETFs Yet an ETF is like having a picture… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) July 25, 2025 Commodities take center stage Kiyosaki’s comments echo his long-standing distrust of fiat monetary systems and pessimism regarding the future of global finance . The writer recently noted that several major asset bubbles are on the verge of bursting, including those mentioned in his most recent tweet. When Bitcoin crashes, he predicted, gold and silver are likely to follow. However, he framed the potential downturn as a buying opportunity, stating that if prices do collapse, he plans to step in and purchase more of these assets. Bitcoin ETFs see record inflows Regardless of Kiyosaki’s thoughts and predictions, Bitcoin spot ETFs are seeing record inflows. On July 24, for instance, the funds saw a combined net inflow of $227 million, with Fidelity being responsible for $107 million and pushing its total historical inflow to $12.427 billion, based on Binance data. Currently, the total net asset value (NAV) of all Bitcoin spot ETFs stands at $154.45 billion, representing around 6.54% of BTC’s total market capitalization. Overall, historical net inflows across all ETFs have now reached $54.69 billion. Featured image via Shutterstock The post R.

This message is for those investors who rely heavily on paper assets like ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds). Although ETFs can make investing easier for beginners, they might not always be the smartest choice in uncertain times, he says. Know When To Go Beyond ETFs In his words, “An ETF is like having a picture of a gun for self-defense.” That is why he urges people to understand the difference between owning papers and the “real thing.” BEWARE of PAPER I realize ETFs make investing easier for the average investor….so I do recommend ETFs for the average investor. Yet I extend these words of caution: For the average investor I recommend: Gold ETFs Silver ETFs Bitcoin ETFs Yet an ETF is like having a picture… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) July 25, 2025 For an average investor, he still recommends Gold, Silver and Bitcoin ETFs. But he also stresses the importance of knowing when its better to have physical gold and silver, real Bitcoin (not just ETF shares). His message is simple but powerful: Know the difference between paper and real assets — and know when to use each one. This is what separates the average from the truly prepared. Gold, Bitcoin up 28%: ETFs in Focus Gold and Bitcoin are both up 28% in 2025, as investors turn to alternatives for diversification. With stock markets volatile and bond returns uneven, ETFs have become the go-to way to gain exposure to assets like gold, Bitcoin, and even altcoins. Gold ETFs remain strong, with over $170 billion in assets as of April. Bitcoin ETFs, launched last year, have seen tremendous success and now Ethereum ETFs are gaining momentum too. With big players like BlackRock and Fidelity, the institutional interest and inflows continue to rise. Ethereum ETFs Outpace Bitcoin U.S spot ETFs saw strong momentum yesterday as well. Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $226.7 million in net inflows, with BlackRock alone contributing $32.5 million.Ethereum ETFs did even better, with $231.2 million in net inflows and Fidelity led the charge by adding a massive $210.1 million in ETH. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) recently hit $10 billion in assets, doubling from $5B in just 10 days. That makes it the fastest Ethereum ETF to reach $10B, and the third fastest ETF ever in U.S. history. Lately, Ethereum ETFs have even outpaced Bitcoin in inflows. On July 17 alone, they brought in $602 million, beating Bitcoin ETFs for the day. As of July 24, Spot Ethereum ETFs have seen a cumulative net inflow of $8.88 billion.

Source: Finbold Using Arkham data, the analysis reveals that a major Bitcoin OG with 80,009 BTC (~$9.6 billion) has been systematically moving large amounts of Bitcoin through Galaxy Digital. The whale’s timeline The massive sell-off began on July 15, when the whale sent 9,000 BTC ($1.06 billion) to Galaxy Digital, followed by another 7,843 BTC ($927 million), totaling 16,843 BTC ($2 billion) moved to Galaxy on that day alone. Galaxy Digital immediately began depositing the Bitcoin to exchanges, with 2,000 BTC ($236 million) going to Binance and Bybit platforms. Later, on July 15, an additional 40,009 BTC ($4.68 billion) was transferred to Galaxy Digital. On July 17, the whale transferred another 40,192 BTC ($4.77 billion) to a new wallet address (bc1qs4) before sending the entire amount to Galaxy Digital on July 18. The selling pressure culminated in 30,109 Bitcoin, worth approximately $3.5 billion, being sent to exchanges and other wallets in just the last 24 hours. Broader macro factors The whale selling comes at a particularly sensitive time for Bitcoin markets, with multiple early holders becoming active. In addition to this massive distribution, other dormant wallets have recently awakened , including a 14.5-year-old wallet containing $468 million worth of Bitcoin. Traders are closely monitoring the Federal Reserve’s upcoming policy meeting scheduled for July 30, where the central bank is expected to maintain current interest rates, though market participants will focus on official commentary regarding future monetary policy direction. Coinciding with the Fed meeting, White House crypto adviser Bo Hines announced this week that the President’s Digital Asset Working Group has completed its long-awaited 180-day crypto policy report, scheduled for public release on July 30. The report, required by a January executive order, is anticipated to provide details on the quantity of seized Bitcoin held by the U.S. government and outline potential management strategies for these holdings. Beyond the Bitcoin reserve framework, the working group is expected to propose a comprehensive regulatory structure for digital assets. Featured image via Shutterstock.

The benchmark cryptocurrency slipped from an intraday peak above $119,000 late Thursday to trade as low as $115,800 in European morning hours, its weakest print in a fortnight. The 2.7 percentage-point slide followed an unmistakable on-chain signal: Galaxy Digital quietly pushed more than 10,000 BTC—worth about $1.18 billion at the time—onto major exchanges in less than eight hours, according to wallet-tracking firm Lookonchain. Galaxy Digital Triggers Bitcoin Slide “Bitcoin sell-off still underway! Galaxy Digital deposited another 2,850 BTC ($330.44M) to exchanges,” Lookonchain warned on X in the early European morning hours, noting that the transfer originated from a Satoshi-era whale that re-awakened this month. Prior to that, the analytics account posted an alert: “Note that Galaxy Digital has deposited over 10,000 BTC ($1.18B) to exchanges in the past 8 hours!” Screenshots of Arkham Intelligence dashboards showed a series of multi-million-dollar transactions converging on Binance, Bybit and OKX.

Analyst Links Binance Spot Volume Surges To Price Upswings The flows are the latest chapter in a saga that began on 4 July, when an address dormant since 2011 started chopping an 80,009-BTC trove into 10,000-coin tranches. By 18 July the final 40,191 BTC—worth $4.8 billion—had landed at Galaxy, a move many analysts interpreted as a potential sale. That potential is now reality. On-chain data shows Galaxy sends Bitcoin to various crypto exchanges almost every minute to sell it. The BTC price is reacting with textbook symmetry: spot BTC slipped through $118,000 during the Asian session before knifing to $116,000 as London desks opened, wiping roughly $55 billion from bitcoin’s market value in just 4 hours. Galaxy Digital, run by billionaire Michael Novogratz, offered no public comment at the time of writing and has not filed any Form 8-K that might indicate a balance-sheet reshuffle. The firm’s most recent media appearance came on CNBC yesterday, where Novogratz repeated his view that Ether could “outperform” bitcoin over the next few months,” but did not hint at near-term selling. Related Reading: Are Traders Walking Into a Bitcoin Bull Trap at $118K? Here’s What the Data Shows While motives remain opaque, market spectators were quick to theorise. “Looks like the Bitcoin selloff is Galaxy Digital market dumping from a batch of 80K BTC. Could be because they were asked to for a client, something related to Saylor, or moving into Ethereum as Novogratz suggested ETH may move more than BTC in the next few months (today on CNBC). Not worried. They have about 27K left to sell (if they’re selling the full 80k), people buy, life goes on, it continues upwards,” the crypto-focused account Autism Capital posted via X. Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards commented via X: “At the same time that this OG whale is dropping 10K slugs into spot markets today, we have 30K of leveraged longs opening on the dip. Not a price prediction and changes nothing mid- to long-term, but this is not a great sign for the short-term price action. Even if all 80K BTC are nuked, if Treasury Company demand remains consistent, it will all be consumed in a couple weeks.” At press time, BTC traded at $115,476.

In the new improvement document published on the development hosting platform GitHub, Solana developers say that the SIMD-0286 proposal will increase the network’s per-block compute limit from 60 million compute units (CU) to 100 million CU. Compute units serve as resources needed for every transaction on the Solana network. The amount of CU spent varies depending on the complexity of the operation. The developers unveiled the SIMD-0286 proposal in the wake of the network’s recent upgrade. SIMD-0256, which was activated earlier this week, increased the block ceiling from the previous 50 million CU to 60 million CU. “The intention is for this to follow SIMD-0256 (as opposed to replacing). SIMD-0256 is a much more modest increase in block space. This proposal aims to increase block space more aggressively.” The proposal to increase the limit to 100 million CU will further boost the network’s block capacity by over 65% albeit the developers say the improvement may cause unforeseen issues in infrastructure beyond the validators. “Block limits’ primary purpose is to ensure the vast majority of network participants are able to keep up with the network… This proposal aims for a substantial increase in block limits to 100M CUs, in order to provide additional capacity to the network.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-25T09:00:00,"ETH on Track to Hit $4K And Beat Bitcoin: Galaxy Digital CEO","Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz sees ETH breaking $4,000 soon, with other analysts projecting even higher targets. Ethereum ETFs also recently outpaced Bitcoin ETFs in inflows for six consecutive days, led by BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH. Additionally, on-chain data shows lower ETH selling pressure, while technical levels suggest $4,500 as a key resistance point. With ETH outperforming BTC by over 36% in the past month, Ethereum could continue leading the market in the coming months. Ethereum Set to Outperform Bitcoin Institutional interest in Ethereum (ETH) is accelerating at a remarkable pace, and Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz believes it could propel ETH to outperform Bitcoin (BTC) over the next three to six months. Speaking to CNBC , Novogratz pointed to a tightening ETH supply and strong market momentum, and suggested that a breakout past $4,000 could lead Ethereum into a phase of price discovery. With Ethereum currently hovering around $3,641, that target reflects a modest 8+% climb. Novogratz firmly believes that it's well within reach, saying, “We feel kind of destined to at least knock on the $4,000 ceiling a few times.” ETH price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Backing Novogratz’s optimism are major corporate purchases of ETH. BitMine Immersion Technologies recently disclosed holdings of 566,776 ETH valued at roughly $2.03 billion, while Sharplink Gaming reported 360,807 ETH worth around $1.29 billion. Another firm, Ether Machine, is preparing to list on Nasdaq under the ticker “ETHM,” with more than 400,000 ETH — about $1.5 billion — under management at launch. At the same time, Ethereum’s performance relative to Bitcoin has surged by over 36% in the past 30 days, according to TradingView data. Despite this, Novogratz is also bullish on Bitcoin, and suggested that a $150,000 price point is achievable as long as macroeconomic conditions remain favorable. He did warn, however, that a shift in US monetary policy sentiment, especially if President Donald Trump reverses his stance on rate cuts, could alter the bullish trajectory. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes took an even more optimistic stance on Ethereum by projecting a potential rally to $10,000 by the end of the year. Meanwhile, analysts at Bitfinex have pegged $136,000 as the next key upside target for Bitcoin, but warned that such levels typically coincide with market euphoria and could mark a temporary top. Overall, the narrative surrounding Ethereum is gaining steam, fueled by strategic accumulation from institutional players and a compelling macro backdrop. While both Ethereum and Bitcoin are poised for potential gains, ETH’s tightening supply and growing adoption may give it the upper hand over the coming months. ETH ETFs Dominate The surge in institutional interest in Ethereum became even more evident after spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) attracted more capital than their Bitcoin counterparts over the past six trading days. According to data from Farside Investors , Ethereum ETFs recorded close to $2.4 billion in net inflows during this period, overshadowing the $827 million seen by spot Bitcoin ETFs. Interestingly, Ethereum ETFs outperformed Bitcoin ETFs in daily inflows for each of the six days. Ethereum ETF flows (Source: Farside Investors ) BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF (ETHA) stepped up as the dominant player, pulling in $1.79 billion. This is about 75% of the total inflows. ETHA also recently achieved a major milestone by becoming the third-fastest ETF to reach $10 billion in assets under management, doing so in just 251 trading days. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (FETH) set a new single-day inflow record on Thursday, receiving $210 million. This allowed it to surpass its previous high from December of 2024. Market analysts from Swissblock Research anticipate this momentum to continue in Ethereum’s favor, and suggested that ETH is beginning to take the lead as the crypto cycle enters its next phase. ETH Gathers Even More Strength Ethereum continues to show signs of strength relative to Bitcoin, with on-chain data also suggesting that ETH faces lower selling pressure compared to BTC. According to CryptoQuant , the ETH/BTC exchange inflows ratio is still far from historically high levels, indicating fewer ETH tokens are being moved to exchanges and suggesting reduced sell-side activity. This trend supports the potential for continued ETH outperformance. Additionally, the ETH/BTC ETF holding ratio climbed from 0.02 in May to 0.12. This could mean that there is growing investor preference for Ethereum exposure over Bitcoin. ETH/BTC exchange inflows ratio. (Source: CryptoQuant ) Glassnode’s cost basis model pointed out some key price levels to monitor for Ether. On the downside, support lies between $2,000 and $3,000, with specific levels at $2,100, $2,500, and $3,000. These reflect the realized price, true market mean, and active realized price respectively, offering strong support in the event of a pullback. On the upside, resistance sits at $4,500, a level that historically signals market euphoria and potential overextension. A decisive break above $3,860 is needed to fuel the next leg of the rally toward $4,000 and beyond.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/10185/eth-on-track-to-hit-4-k-and-beat-bitcoin-galaxy-digital-ceo,"ETH|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-07-25T08:59:55,"Bitcoin Selloff Alert: Galaxy Digital Triggers Panic With $9.5B BTC Moves","The post Bitcoin Selloff Alert: Galaxy Digital Triggers Panic With $9.5B BTC Moves appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Today, Bitcoin is bleeding around $115,500–$116,000 , down about 2–3%. The broader crypto market also saw the bloodbath, with total market capitalization falling nearly 5–7% in the past 24 hours. This pullback follows a near-record rally, suggesting profit-taking is in full swing. Bitcoin is back under pressure after Galaxy Digital, a major crypto investment firm, moved billions to various exchanges over the past 9 hours. BTC Selloff Triggered? BITCOIN is approaching $115K, a level not seen in the past 2 weeks. Galaxy Digital has reportedly offloaded over $2B worth of Bitcoin to centralized exchanges in just the last 8 hours. This is not a dip… it is a test of conviction. Will bulls take… pic.twitter.com/nEU6RWe9f7 — Wise Advice (@wiseadvicesumit) July 25, 2025 These large transfers have sparked fresh concerns of a possible sell-off, especially as BTC dipped nearly 2% in the same 24-hour period. Why is Bitcoin down Today? Spot On Chain flagged a major Bitcoin transfer by Galaxy Digital, which deposited 11,910 BTC (worth $1.39 billion) to several exchanges in just 9 hours. These funds appear to come from a “Bitcoin OG” wallet that offloaded 80,202 BTC, over $9.5 billion, between July 15 and 18 at an average price of $118,950. Earlier, on July 15, Galaxy had already sent 2,000 BTC ($236M) to Binance and Bybit. This sudden activity has raised fears of a large-scale sell-off, coinciding with a ~2% dip in BTC price over the last 24 hours. While these transfers don’t automatically mean Galaxy is selling, the scale and timing have raised eyebrows, especially with Bitcoin showing weakness just above $115K, its lowest level in weeks. Market Challenging the Long Positions? As this news broke, the futures market saw over $700 million in long position liquidations. This suggests traders were caught off guard, triggering a “long squeeze” where forced selling accelerates price drops. Some believe this pressure is temporary, but it’s clear the market is feeling uneasy. At the same time, on-chain trackers and analysts are closely watching exchange flows. Many traders fear that such big transfers could eventually lead to more selling, adding to the short-term volatility. Sentiment Still Holds in the Long Term Despite the recent dip, broader sentiment hasn’t turned fully bearish. Institutional interest remains strong, especially with Bitcoin ETFs still seeing steady inflows. While short-term fear has crept in, most analysts agree this doesn’t change Bitcoin’s longer-term trend. Crypto analyst known as T suggests that while institutions may be taking profits near the $115K level, it’s not a sign of weakness. He reminds followers that Bitcoin is still up 500% since ETF approvals, and movements like Galaxy Digital’s recent transfers are likely just routine portfolio rebalancing. He also compares it to MicroStrategy’s early BTC sales, which didn’t stop Bitcoin’s long-term rise. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-25T08:58:15,"Bitcoin (BTC) Hits Lower Low Amid Heavy Selling: Price Analysis","A huge whale, an OG from the early days of Bitcoin mining, is still selling a significant amount of 80k $BTC. Amid this heavy selling the $BTC price has fallen as low as $115,000. Could Bitcoin collapse to $112,000, or is a bounce finally about to arrive? $BTC price forms bull flag Source: TradingView The short-term chart for $BTC illustrates how close to the brink the price is right now. The triangle pattern that was previously being drawn for the price action has now been updated to a flag, which after this latest price drop, fits the $BTC movements well over the last several days. It now remains to be seen whether the bulls can hold the line, or whether the bears can force the price out of the bottom of the flag and confirm below. If the bears do win this struggle, a drop to $112,000 could happen very quickly. Heavy selling from OG whale According to the Lookonchain X account, posts tell that 10K $BTC, probably from an OG whale, has recently been sold, and since then, another 2,850 $BTC has been transferred to exchanges. This particular source of selling is ongoing. So to sum up, one of two scenarios are about to happen. The first scenario is that the price does collapse out of the flag, and a rapid descent to $112,000 ensues. The other scenario is that the bulls are able to defend the bottom of the flag, and that this becomes the point from which a strong bounce can take place. It should be borne in mind that the bull market is continuing, the trend is up, and even if the price does fall back, this could just be a small hiccup on the way. Measured move out of bull flag to $130,000 Source: TradingView The daily time frame shows how the bull flag has now taken shape. If the price does hold where it is now, and then starts to retrace towards the top of the bull flag, a measured move is displayed in the chart above with the dashed red arrows. The height of the pole is taken from the breakout of the previous big bull flag to the top of the current small one. This is then transferred to the bottom point of the flag. The height of the pole corresponds pretty much exactly to $130,000. Could this be the next target? At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators are now very close to the bottom. The next day or two could see them angle back to the upside. This current correction is likely drawing to a close. $BTC price about to become more parabolic? Source: TradingView The weekly chart, with a curve drawn in, displays how the price is now leaving the curve and is potentially becoming more parabolic. This does make sense if Bitcoin is indeed entering the final phase of its bull run. Having said that, once $130,000 is reached, perhaps another bigger continuation pattern will force the price sideways and down for an extended period, which could see the price make contact with the curve again. The problem of making these kinds of future guesses is that it is not known whether this particular bull market will be the typical 4-year cycle we have been used to seeing so far, or whether it will be an extended cycle, given the huge influx of institutional money entering the market. What should be known soon is if the Stochastic RSI indicators on the weekly time frame will cross back up, or whether they will bounce from the 80.00 level and then cross back up. If these indicator lines do stay at the top for an extended period, expect plenty of upside price action. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.
