2025-07-25T19:55:36,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Dips As Massive Transfer Impacts Prices","Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below $115,000 during the ongoing session, dropping to a low of $114,770 thanks to Galaxy Digital moving a whopping 17,123 BTC, worth nearly $2 billion, to multiple centralized exchanges.¬†Market sentiment also turned cautious ahead of the US Federal Reserve meeting and the release of a key crypto policy report. The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $116,548. Galaxy Digital Moves Bitcoin (BTC) To Centralized Exchanges Galaxy Digital has moved 17,123 BTC , worth nearly $2 billion, to multiple centralized exchanges in the past 12 hours. Blockchain intelligence platform Lookonchain noted that Galaxy Digital initially sent 10,000 BTC to exchanges in the past 8 hours. The transfer comes after the digital asset firm received 80,000 BTC from a Satoshi-era whale whose wallet was dormant for 14 years. Lookonchain stated on X, ‚ÄúNote that it has deposited over 10,000 ($1.18B) to exchanges in the past 8 hours! The 10,000+ comes from the Bitcoin OG holding 80,009 ($9.68B).‚Äù Galaxy Digital has withdrawn over 370 million USDT from centralized exchanges, including Bybit, OKX, and Binance. ‚ÄúSuspected to belong to the 14-year BTC fossil hand, 14,273 $BTC were deposited in batches into various exchanges by Galaxy Digital over the past 12 hours, valued at approximately $1.67 billion.‚Äù The selloff has impacted Bitcoin prices, with the flagship cryptocurrency registering a sharp correction over the past 24 hours, as it fell below $115,000 to a low of $114,770. The decline has rattled investors, with many questioning if BTC can continue pushing higher in the face of such substantial selling pressure. Strategy Launches New Preferred Stock To Build Bitcoin War Chest Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy has launched a new type of preferred stock and upsized it from $500 million to $2.8 billion. The security, which Strategy is calling Stretch, promises a 9% annual payout, with no end date attached. The deal is part of Saylor‚Äôs efforts to transform his software company into a financial juggernaut with one goal: to raise funds to acquire as much Bitcoin as possible. Strategy‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings are worth over $70 billion at current prices. Campbell Harvey, a professor at Duke University, stated, ‚ÄúThis is not the first financial engineering initiative by Strategy. In any situation where your company is worth far more than its fundamental value, you raise money.‚Äù Strategy has issued various types of debt and layered stacks of preferred stocks. The company has pioneered the ‚ÄúBitcoin treasury‚Äù strategy, with several other public companies adopting the Strategy‚Äôs approach. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) plummeted below $115,000 on Friday, falling to a low of $114,770, resulting in the liquidation of over half a billion dollars in long positions. According to data from Coinglass, $585 million in long positions was liquidated, with Bitcoin accounting for $140 million of the total. Crypto trader Ash Crypto noted in a post on X, ‚ÄúThis dump is a pure leverage flush. Many people longed Alts after they saw ETH pumping hard, so market makers dumped and liquidated the late longs.‚Äù Despite the significant pullback, overall crypto market sentiment remains bullish, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index posting a ‚ÄúGreed‚Äù score of 70 on Friday. The pullback comes even as several crypto figures, including Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz, predicted higher prices for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. BTC‚Äôs dip below $115,000 earlier in the session was prompted by the distribution of thousands of BTC to crypto exchanges by Galaxy Digital. The drop triggered a wave of liquidations, becoming the latest chapter in the saga of the 80,000 BTC , which were last moved 14 years ago. Lookonchain noted, ‚ÄúBitcoin sell-off still underway! #GalaxyDigital deposited another 2,850 $BTC ($330.44M) to exchanges 11 minutes ago.‚Äù Despite the selloff, analysts stated that markets had not entered a state of panic. ‚ÄúI see the current state of the market as cautionary more than panic. Panic often has volume & considerable volatility, which we don't have currently. Time to watch for sure though.‚Äù BTC started the previous week on a bullish note, surging past $120,000 and reaching a new all-time high of $123,091. However, it lost momentum on Tuesday as traders locked in their profits. As a result, the price plunged to an intraday low of $115,701 before recovering to reclaim $117,000, settling at $117,682, ultimately registering a 1.70% decline. BTC rose on Wednesday, rising 0.82% to reclaim $118,000 and settle at $118,641. The price faced volatility on Thursday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC rose 0.39% to cross $119,000 and settle at $119,101. Selling pressure returned on Friday as the price fell 1,03%, dropping to a low of $116,805 before settling at $117,877.

2025-07-25T19:51:29,"Meme Coin Traders Pour Into Viral Newcomer Below $0.002 as Bitcoin (BTC) Eyes Move Toward $140,000","Bitcoin is back in the spotlight, climbing past $118,000 and threatening to push even higher. Bulls aren't stepping away after touching $123K and cooling off just yet. Analysts at CryptoQuant have flagged a technical window that could keep the rally alive a bit longer, suggesting BTC still has room to grow 20% to 25% before short-term holders begin heavy profit-taking. With BTC setting the pace, the question becomes: which altcoins are best positioned to ride that wave? Little Pepe Is Quietly Building a Meme-Era Juggernaut Every bull market has its meme moment; this cycle already shows signs of that energy shifting. Enter Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , a new Ethereum Layer-2 meme coin that's not just about internet culture; it's building real infrastructure under the hood. It's still early, but LILPEPE has already raised over $7.8 million in its presale, selling over 6 billion tokens and attracting a tidal wave of organic interest across Telegram, X, and emerging meme launchpads. Unlike most meme coins, this one runs on its own Ethereum-compatible Layer-2, purpose-built for low gas fees, sniper bot resistance, and meme-only launch tools like its Pump Pad. That technical backbone causes a pivot among degens and seasoned traders who've typically avoided meme assets. With zero-tax trading and a native ecosystem, LILPEPE is hitting the sweet spot between fun and function. Little Pepe's presale has been nothing short of explosive. With each stage selling out faster than the last, the demand for $LILPEPE tokens has intensified as more users recognize the project's long-term potential. That momentum has now carried into Stage 6, where tokens are available at $0.0015‚Äîa 7% increase from the previous stage. But it's the timing that makes this more than a casual scroll. History shows meme coins tend to rip after Bitcoin has its run, especially when BTC breaks into new highs. And when the crowd rotates back into high-upside tokens with early-stage positioning, the ones with the strongest communities and cleanest tech run the hardest. So far, LILPEPE looks like the one everyone's watching. Some early calls are placing their post-launch ceiling between $0.10 and $0.30, which would mean 20x to 50x returns from here, if the rollout delivers. It's still early, but if the next meme season starts with Bitcoin at six figures, this Layer-2 joker might not stay under $0.002 for long. Why Traders Are Moving Capital Now Dogecoin is still out there. So is Shiba Inu. However, the truth is that legacy meme coins are starting to lose their first-mover advantage. SHIB's charts have flattened, and DOGE hasn't seen a meaningful new narrative in over a year. That's leaving space for something fresh, something built for the current wave of traders. And that's where LILPEPE fits in. It's not just another frog; it has a strategy, a product pipeline, and most importantly, a community that shows up. That's rare in this niche, which is why capital is shifting in this direction. What It All Means Bitcoin's sudden increase in value towards $140,000 is influencing the entire crypto market. BTC is spearheading the recovery as the on-chain metrics show distinct improvements, macro sentiment is quite supportive, and there is renewed focus from institutions. But when Bitcoin moves, it rarely moves alone. Historically, such momentum at the top ignites a cascading wave across altcoins, particularly meme coins. As capital flows outward from BTC, the real percentage gains tend to emerge in smaller, high-upside assets. The Bottom Line Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is one of those rare meme coins built for that breakout moment. It's not a recycled Doge or SHIB spin-off‚Äîit's a Layer-2 with its lightweight blockchain, zero-tax trading, bot protection, and a meme-native launchpad ecosystem. Combined with a wildly successful presale that's already raised $7.8 million and sold over 6 billion tokens, those features position it perfectly to ride the next altseason wave. So, while Bitcoin paves the road with institutional firepower, LILPEPE might be the coin darting ahead in the fast lane. At $0.0015, with CoinMarketCap visibility, 98% of present presale stage tokens are gone, and an engaged community is behind it, so the runway is wide open.

Last Time Bitcoin Price Had Exploded","US President Donald Trump said today that some Americans may receive ‚Äústimulus checks‚Äù from tariff revenues collected this year. While this proposal represents a form of compensation for consumers affected by high prices, it has also raised concerns that it could trigger a new wave of inflation. ‚ÄúThere's so much money coming in that we're considering a small refund,‚Äù Trump told reporters outside the White House. ‚ÄúA small refund for people at a certain income level would be very nice,‚Äù he said. According to Treasury Department data, the US government collected more than $100 billion in tariff revenue in the first half of the year. This figure is expected to exceed $27 billion in July. However, much of this revenue has not yet been directly passed on to consumers. However, price increases have begun to be observed in the product groups subject to the highest tariffs.

The new payment option was quietly added to the federal ‚ÄúGifts to Reduce the Public Debt‚Äù program, an initiative that has existed since 1996. Users can now access Pay.gov and use the digital platforms to send voluntary contributions toward the debt, as first reported by NPR‚Äôs Jack Corbett. you can venmo the United States to help pay off the national debt pic.twitter.com/UBfSvbAIx0 ‚Äî Jack Corbett (@jackcorrbit) July 23, 2025 According to Treasury officials, Venmo and PayPal will make it easier for civic-minded Americans to contribute. Since its inception, the donation initiative has collected $67.3 million, an amount that is dwarfed by the sheer size of the federal debt. Debt surged nearly 90% since 2010 The current US national debt has surged by 87% since 2010, when it stood at $19.59 trillion. The Treasury Department has warned that ballooning deficits have placed America‚Äôs fiscal sustainability at risk. According to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, the total debt grew at nearly $55,000 every second over the past year alone. The donations may be entirely voluntary, but in the eyes of naysayers, those individual contributions, regardless of how many, cannot significantly alter the country‚Äôs downward looking fiscal trajectory. ‚ÄúIf every American donated $1,000 right now, it still wouldn‚Äôt make a meaningful dent,‚Äù said Shawn French, host of ‚ÄúThe Determined Society‚Äù podcast. ‚ÄúThis feels more like desperation than strategy.‚Äù French said the US government‚Äôs plea is ‚Äúa massive distraction‚Äù and ‚Äúa last-ditch attempt‚Äù of asking the public to help bring down the debt, but the current administration does not have any viable structural reforms. Samson Mow, CEO of Bitcoin technology firm JAN3, compared the program to ‚Äúsending Bitcoin to a burn address,‚Äù an irreversible crypto transaction that results in token destruction. The Treasury reiterated that the donation option is a chance for patriotic individuals to contribute to ‚ÄúMaking America Great Again,‚Äù no matter how small the impact may be on the overall balance sheet. Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄòBig, Beautiful Bill‚Äô adds trillions to debt The recently passed and signed legislation backed by President Donald Trump, referred to as the ‚ÄúBig, Beautiful Bill,‚Äù is expected to increase the national debt by $3.4 trillion over the next decade, according to projections by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO). A contentious element of the now-passed law was the decision to raise the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, which several economic commentators, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, were loudly unhappy about. The billionaire entrepreneur coined the law as ‚Äúfiscally reckless.‚Äù The Congressional Budget Office revealed on Monday that more than 10 million Americans will be uninsured under the provisions of the new law by 2034. This figure is a slight improvement over earlier projections that estimated 11.8 million would lose health coverage over the next decade. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs report reminds us of something: facts are stubborn and the facts are clear,‚Äù remarked Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer. ‚ÄúThe big, ugly betrayal is a loser for the country and will be a loser for the Republicans.‚Äù Conservative lawmakers have continued to defend the legislation, claiming it was necessary to pass it to prevent tax increases for millions of Americans. Supporters believe the US economy will outperform the CBO‚Äôs projections, generating greater tax revenues to narrow the deficit. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

At that point, HCTI will need to close at $1.00 or more for 20 trading days in a row by September 5th. The stock now has a market cap of just over $30 million after reporting a 10% revenue decline in Q1 at $3.7 million. The drop was triggered by lower demand for the company‚Äôs services across the board, with the firm‚Äôs five largest clients accounting for 57% of total revenue.

2025-07-25T19:00:58,"XRP Should Be Worth $30 Today Based on This Bitcoin Comparison","In a recent X post, prominent crypto commentator Amonyx reignited a long-standing debate by stating that XRP should be trading at over $30 based on its historical ratio to Bitcoin. The argument hinges on a comparison from 2018, when XRP peaked at approximately 0.00026 BTC. With Bitcoin now trading around $117,800, a simple multiplication of that ratio would imply that XRP should be worth over $30. However, despite a strong performance in recent weeks, XRP is still trading far below that theoretical target. XRP-Bitcoin Ratio from 2018 In early 2018, XRP experienced a euphoric rally, briefly surging to a Bitcoin-denominated price of about 0.0002247 BTC, which aligns closely with the 0.00026 BTC figure referenced by Amonyx. At that time, the entire crypto market was riding a speculative wave, and XRP had become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The XRP/BTC ratio, however, was more a product of hype and less an indication of sustainable value or utility. Fast forward to 2025, and the market dynamics have changed drastically. Bitcoin has soared to above $117,000, but XRP‚Äôs current value remains around $3.06, a far cry from the $30 that the 2018 ratio would suggest. In 2018, $XRP peaked at 0.00026 BTC. Now that BTC is at $117,800, XRP should be worth $30+. But it‚Äôs still crawling‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Amonyx (@amonbuy) July 25, 2025 Current Price Performance and Market Conditions As of report time, XRP is trading at $3.06, down slightly from its recent all-time high of $3.66. This new peak surpassed its 2018 high of around $3.40, marking a significant milestone in XRP‚Äôs performance. When compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs meteoric rise, XRP appears to be lagging. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance remains strong, and altcoins like XRP, while rallying, are not keeping pace on a BTC-relative basis. There are several reasons for this disparity. In 2018, XRP‚Äôs rise was largely speculative, driven by hopes that Ripple‚Äôs payment technologies would see swift global adoption. In contrast, the 2025 market is more mature, with increased regulatory scrutiny, institutional involvement , and clearer utility expectations for digital assets. XRP‚Äôs adoption is growing, particularly with developments around Ripple‚Äôs RLUSD stablecoin and new enterprise partnerships, but these advances have not yet translated into a BTC-equivalent price surge. Why XRP Isn‚Äôt Trading at $30 Despite Historical Projections The assumption that XRP should mirror its 2018 BTC ratio fails to account for how both assets have evolved. Bitcoin has become a globally recognized store of value, institutional asset, and hedge against macro uncertainty. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Its rise is driven by deep liquidity and global demand. XRP, on the other hand, remains a payment-focused asset with unique regulatory and technological hurdles. While XRP‚Äôs ecosystem is expanding, including growing transaction volume and utility through the XRP Ledger and Hooks amendments, its pace of institutional adoption is markedly slower than Bitcoin‚Äôs. Moreover, the speculative nature of the 2018 XRP/BTC ratio was unsustainable. Today‚Äôs pricing reflects a more grounded valuation based on real-world utility, network growth, and regulatory progress. Analysts now favor models that assess XRP independently, rather than tying its fate to past correlations with Bitcoin. Forecasts from leading firms suggest XRP could reach $7 to $15 over the next 12 to 18 months, but few see a realistic path to $30 unless new catalysts emerge. Amonyx‚Äôs argument is grounded in historical data, but market conditions have shifted dramatically since XRP‚Äôs 2018 peak against Bitcoin. While the math suggests XRP should be worth over $30 today, the market tells a different story. At $3.06, XRP is performing strongly in 2025, especially considering recent regulatory clarity and adoption milestones. However, the days of comparing altcoins strictly against Bitcoin ratios may be behind us, as each asset now follows its path defined by utility, compliance, and investor demand.

The ‚ÄúOpen Interest‚Äù here refers to an indicator that measures the total amount of positions related to BTC (in USD) that are currently open on all centralized derivatives exchanges.

Generally, the total leverage in the sector goes up when new positions appear, so this kind of trend can lead to more volatility for the cryptocurrency. On the other hand, the indicator going down suggests the holders are either closing up positions of their own volition or getting liquidated by their platform. Whatever the case be, the asset‚Äôs price can behave in a more stable manner after such a trend. Now, here is a chart that shows how the value of the Bitcoin Open Interest has changed over the last month: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Open Interest rose to a high value earlier in the month when the asset‚Äôs rally to the new all-time high (ATH) took place. This wasn‚Äôt anything unusual, as speculation tends to flood in during periods of exciting price action. As BTC retraced from its peak and settled into a phase of boring consolidation, the metric‚Äôs value calmed down a bit. Now, the coin has finally diverged from this sideways movement, showing a downwards move. Interestingly, the Open Interest has rocketed up alongside this price plunge and set a new record around $44.5 billion. From the chart, it‚Äôs visible that price declines usually accompany drawdowns in the indicator, as longs find liquidation. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unusual for BTC price direction and open interest to move in a negative correlation,‚Äù notes the quant.

As mentioned before, an increase in the metric can amplify price volatility. This happens because the chances of a mass liquidation event taking place go up during such conditions. It now remains to be seen how this Open Interest increase would unwind this time around and whether a long squeeze or a short one would take place. BTC Price Bitcoin saw a brief dip under $115,000 earlier, but its price has since retraced a bit as it‚Äôs back at $116,000.
