2025-07-25T18:45:25,"New Malware Variant Taps Microsoft Technology To Steal Sensitive Bank Customer Data: Cybersecurity Researchers","Security researchers are warning of a newly identified malware variant that makes use of Microsoft technology to steal bank customer data. The cybersecurity firm Akamai Technologies says that it has confirmed the first case of a new variant of the Coyote banking trojan maliciously using Microsoft’s UI Automation (UIA) framework “in the wild.” Says Akamai security researcher Tomer Peled, “Coyote now leverages UIA as part of its operation. Like any other banking trojan, Coyote is hunting banking information, but what sets Coyote apart is the way it obtains this information, which involves the (ab)use of UIA.” Peled says that the new variant is targeting Brazilian users by using UIA to “extract credentials linked to 75 banking institutes’ web addresses and cryptocurrency exchanges.” “Coyote can perform checks, regardless of whether the malware is online or operating in an offline mode. This increases the chances of successfully identifying a victim’s bank or crypto exchange and stealing their credentials. UIA provides several things for an attacker, including a simple solution for malware developers to parse sub-elements of another application.” The Coyote malware family was first discovered in February 2024, when it was targeting mostly Latin America. “Coyote is a trojan malware that employs various malicious techniques, such as keylogging and phishing overlays, to steal banking information. It uses the Squirrel installer to propagate (hence the name ‘Coyote,’ which pays homage to the coyotes’ nature to hunt squirrels). In one of its most well-known campaigns, Coyote targeted Brazilian companies in an attempt to deploy an information stealing Remote Access Trojan within their systems.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-25T18:41:16,"Arizona Woman Sentenced to Over Eight Years in Prison for Role in Assisting North Korean Hackers Pose as US Citizens in $17,000,000 Scheme: DOJ","A woman from Arizona has been sentenced to 102 months in prison for helping North Korean hackers pose as American citizens to apply for jobs fraudulently. According to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the scheme involved Christina Chapman of Litchfield Park, AZ, hosting a “laptop farm” to assist DPRK hackers in posing as IT workers and stealing over $17 million from 309 US companies. Chapman’s laptop farm was first seized in 2023. In February of this year, she pleaded guilty to using over 90 computers to receive, host and deceive US companies into hiring North Korean hackers using false, stolen or borrowed US citizen identities. According to court documents, the scheme generated over $17 million for the North Korean government. Some of the duped companies even included Fortune 500 firms. Assistant Director Rozhavsky of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division warns against the reality of where North Korean hacked funds are heading: “The North Korean regime has generated millions of dollars for its nuclear weapons program by victimizing American citizens, businesses, and financial institutions. However, even an adversary as sophisticated as the North Korean government can’t succeed without the assistance of willing US citizens like Christina Chapman, who was sentenced today for her role in an elaborate scheme to defraud more than 300 American companies by helping North Korean IT workers gain virtual employment and launder the money they earned. Today’s sentencing demonstrates that the FBI will work tirelessly with our partners to defend the homeland and hold those accountable who aid our adversaries.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-25T18:36:48,"Revolut restores some crypto service in Hungary","Leading European neobank Revolut has reinstated some of its cryptocurrency services in Hungary, which were suspended after Budapest introduced criminal liability for unauthorized transactions with digital assets. Hungarian users of its app can now transfer their coins to other wallets, something they were unable to do until recently. The company had decided to temporarily halt withdrawals, among other operations, in the face of harsh penalties. Revolut resumes some services in Hungary London-headquartered fintech giant Revolut has partially restored its crypto-related services for Hungarian customers, most notably the option to send over 30 supported tokens to external wallets. This applies to previously deposited assets, as new deposits remain suspended. The move comes after the platform stopped all its crypto features earlier this month, following the adoption of highly restrictive rules by the parliament in Budapest this past June, the English-language portal Hungary Today reported, quoting the business news outlet Portfolio.hu. The new legislation, which went into force on July 1, threatens to punish both businesses and their clients for using or offering crypto services without national licensing. That’s regardless of whether a provider has been licensed in another EU jurisdiction. Under its provisions, private individuals may get up to five years in prison for breaking the law, and operators of crypto platforms face up to eight years behind bars, depending on the value of the transactions they have processed. Arguably, as a precaution, Revolut opted to freeze all crypto functions of its popular banking app, among which are buying, selling, depositing, staking, and even withdrawals. “As of mid-July, withdrawals were re-enabled, and now staking-related features have been restored as well,” Hungary Today highlighted. In a letter to its Hungarian customers, quoted by Portfolio.hu, Revolut wrote: “We are pleased to announce that our staking services are available again.” The fintech firm is also allowing users to access depositing, releasing, and staking rewards through its application, the Hungarian media reported in detail. Key crypto features remain suspended When Revolut announced it’s halting cryptocurrency-related services, it made it clear this is directly related to the recently introduced changes in Hungarian law. It also noted the measure will be in place until further notice, stating: “Unfortunately, we cannot give an exact date when the services will be available again, but as soon as this happens, we will notify you immediately.” The current recovery is only partial, though, as key features such as buying, selling, and receiving crypto, as well as new deposits, remain suspended for the time being. In another notice , Revolut informed Hungarians that it has updated its crypto registration process for new customers: “Due to changes in EU legislation, we temporarily suspend the registration of new crypto customers in some countries. This step was taken as a preparation for the new regulation on the cryptocurrency market (MiCA).” At this point, the U.K.-based company is still pursuing licensing under MiCA, the European Union’s new Markets in Crypto Assets regulation. “As our request for our MiCA license is still in progress, we have decided to pause new registrations to minimize regulatory risk and meet local requirements during the transition period,” the neobank explained. It also pointed out that, besides Hungary, the break applies to all newly opened retail, Revolut X, and Business crypto accounts in the Netherlands, Finland, Latvia, and Slovenia as well. The rules that Budapest is imposing on crypto firms and users are much harsher than what Brussels requires. Members of the crypto community in another Central European nation, Poland , which happens to be the region’s largest market for digital assets, have also expressed concerns about their upcoming regulations.

2025-07-25T18:35:07,"CQ CEO Backtracks on BTC Cycle Theory, Now Cites Institutional Surge","CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju has declared that the long-standing Bitcoin (BTC) cycle theory is “dead,” and has issued a public apology for his earlier bearish predictions. Ju, once a proponent of cycle-based forecasting, where he advocated buying when whales accumulate and selling when retail floods in, acknowledged that “the pattern no longer holds” amid a structural transformation led by institutional investors. The Death of the Bitcoin Cycle Theory In a July 25 post on X, Ju explained that old whales are selling to new long-term whales, adding that holders now outnumber traders and traditional trading strategies now feel “pointless.” “My mistake was ignoring this shift in my ‘bull cycle is over’ call,” wrote the CQ founder. “I sincerely apologize if my prediction impacted your investment. I’ll be more careful with forecasts and focus on providing data-driven insights.” For years, BTC’s price movements followed a familiar rhythm: whales accumulated early, retail FOMO kicked in near the top, and a bear market ensued. However, CryptoQuant’s latest on-chain analysis supports Ju’s new stance. The report shows that in contrast to past cycles where retail investors dominated euphoric peaks, today’s rally is characterized by their absence. Retail selling has intensified, particularly on platforms like Binance, where inflows from small traders surged from $12 billion to $16 billion over the past month. Instead, it’s deep-pocketed investors, institutions, high-volume wallets, and ETFs that are aggressively accumulating. Whales Screener data from earlier in the week supports this, showing over $200 million in BTC was withdrawn from exchanges in one 24-hour period to signal long-term conviction further. Google Trends has also shown muted retail interest, a stark contrast to the social media frenzy of 2021. “This cycle looks nothing like the madness of 2021,” CryptoQuant noted. “Quiet and smart money is currently on stage.” Last year, Stockmoney Lizards, another prominent analyst account, made observations similar to Ju’s. They argued this current cycle “marks the beginning of something different,” with Wall Street and TradFi institutions entering the market in droves. “Mass adoption has started,” they claimed, suggesting future BTC market behavior may resemble the S&P 500 more than the boom-bust patterns of days gone by. A Few Believers Remain However, not everyone agrees. On July 16, pseudonymous analyst CryptoCon pushed back against the growing debate over Bitcoin’s future trajectory, asserting that the four-year halving cycle is still intact. “People expect the 4-year cycle to die every time. It hasn’t,” they said, projecting a cycle top between October and December 2025. Amid the debate, BTC is trading at $115,500, a 2.5% dip in the last 24 hours and a 4.7% decline over the past week. This means it is underperforming the broader crypto market, which is down just 1.5% in that period. The flagship cryptocurrency is now 6.2% below its all-time high set on July 14, though it remains up 8.6% in the last 30 days and nearly 80% year-on-year.

2025-07-25T18:25:11,"Colossal Bitcoin Whale Transfer: A Mysterious $899 Million Move From Coinbase","BitcoinWorld Colossal Bitcoin Whale Transfer: A Mysterious $899 Million Move From Coinbase The cryptocurrency world thrives on transparency, yet moments of profound mystery often capture its collective imagination. Recently, a colossal event sent ripples across the digital asset landscape: a monumental Bitcoin whale transfer . This isn’t just any transaction; it involves a staggering 7,743 BTC, valued at approximately $899 million, moving from the prominent exchange Coinbase to an entirely unknown new wallet. Such a significant shift immediately begs questions and ignites speculation among investors, analysts, and enthusiasts alike. What does such a massive move signify for the market? Is it a strategic play by a major institution, a security measure, or something else entirely? Let’s dive deep into this intriguing event and unravel its potential implications. What Exactly Happened with This Bitcoin Whale Transfer? The news broke courtesy of Whale Alert , a popular blockchain tracking service renowned for monitoring large cryptocurrency transactions. Their report highlighted the transfer of 7,743 BTC from a Coinbase wallet to an address that has no public association, making it an ‘unknown new wallet.’ The sheer scale of this transaction—nearing a billion dollars—makes it one of the most significant single movements of Bitcoin in recent times. This particular Bitcoin whale transfer originated from a known exchange, adding another layer of intrigue. To put the scale into perspective, consider these points: Volume: 7,743 BTC represents a substantial portion of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, though still a small percentage overall. Value: At approximately $899 million, this transfer underscores the immense wealth held by Bitcoin’s largest holders. Origin: Moving from Coinbase, one of the world’s largest and most regulated cryptocurrency exchanges, suggests a deliberate and perhaps strategic action rather than a random occurrence. Destination: An ‘unknown new wallet’ means the recipient’s identity remains anonymous, fueling speculation about their intentions. Why Do Bitcoin Whale Transfers Send Ripples Through the Market? In the decentralized world of cryptocurrencies, large holders, often dubbed ‘whales,’ wield significant influence. Their movements are meticulously watched because they can often precede major price swings or shifts in market sentiment. A Bitcoin whale transfer of this magnitude is akin to a giant ship changing course in the ocean; it creates waves that affect smaller vessels. Here’s why these transfers are so closely monitored: Potential Price Impact: If the Bitcoin is moved to an exchange, it could signal an intent to sell, potentially increasing supply and exerting downward pressure on prices. Conversely, if moved to cold storage, it might indicate long-term holding, reducing available supply and potentially supporting prices. Market Sentiment: Large transfers can create fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) if perceived as a prelude to selling, or inspire confidence if seen as accumulation. Liquidity Implications: A significant withdrawal from an exchange like Coinbase impacts its liquidity, even if temporarily. Insight into Major Players: While identities remain unknown, such transfers offer a glimpse into the activities of major market participants, whose moves are often considered highly strategic. The Enigma of the Unknown Wallet: Who’s Behind This Colossal Bitcoin Whale Transfer? The most captivating aspect of this event is the destination: an unknown new wallet. This anonymity opens the door to numerous theories. While we can only speculate, some common possibilities for such a significant Bitcoin whale transfer include: Institutional OTC (Over-The-Counter) Deal: Large institutions often prefer OTC desks for buying or selling massive amounts of crypto to avoid impacting exchange order books. This transfer could be part of an OTC transaction where the buyer is taking custody. Cold Storage for Long-Term Holding: A whale might be moving their assets from an exchange to a secure, offline cold storage wallet for enhanced security and a long-term holding strategy. This suggests bullish sentiment. Internal Reorganization: Large entities, including exchanges or investment funds, might conduct internal transfers to consolidate assets, rebalance portfolios, or move funds between different operational wallets. Preparation for a Major Sale: While less likely to an unknown new wallet directly, the funds could be destined for a series of smaller sales or another platform for a structured exit. Custodial Services: A large client of Coinbase Custody might be moving their assets to a new, private custodial solution or another secure storage arrangement. Without further on-chain activity or official statements, the true intent behind this specific Bitcoin whale transfer remains shrouded in mystery, adding to the allure of the decentralized financial landscape. Coinbase’s Role and Implications for Exchanges As one of the most prominent and regulated cryptocurrency exchanges globally, Coinbase plays a crucial role in the crypto ecosystem. The fact that this Bitcoin whale transfer originated from Coinbase underscores its status as a major liquidity provider and a hub for large-scale transactions. It’s important to clarify that such a withdrawal is a standard operational procedure and does not indicate any security breach or issue with Coinbase itself. Users are free to move their assets off the platform at any time. However, significant withdrawals from exchanges can have subtle impacts: Aspect Impact on Exchanges Market Implication Liquidity Temporarily reduces available Bitcoin on the exchange. Could make large trades on the exchange slightly more challenging. Trust Reinforces the ability of users to control their assets. Generally positive, showing decentralization in action. Monitoring Exchanges track large withdrawals for compliance. Adds to the data points for on-chain analysts. Decoding Whale Behavior: What Can Investors Learn from Such Transfers? While the immediate reaction to a massive Bitcoin whale transfer might be panic or excitement, savvy investors understand the importance of a measured response. These events serve as valuable data points, but rarely provide a definitive signal on their own. Instead, they encourage a deeper dive into on-chain analytics and market context. Here are some actionable insights for investors: Stay Informed, Not Reactive: Follow reputable on-chain analysis platforms and news sources, but avoid making impulsive decisions based on a single transaction. Look for Follow-Up Moves: A single transfer is less informative than a series of transactions. Does the Bitcoin move again? Does it get split into smaller amounts? Does it land on another exchange? Consider the Broader Market Context: Is the overall market bullish or bearish? What are macroeconomic factors influencing crypto? A large transfer in a bull market might be accumulation, while in a bear market, it could be distribution. Prioritize Your Own Strategy: Don’t let whale movements dictate your entire investment strategy. Stick to your risk management plan and investment thesis. Embrace On-Chain Transparency: The beauty of blockchain is that these transactions are public. While identities are often masked, the movements themselves offer unparalleled transparency into market dynamics. Potential Market Implications: Bullish, Bearish, or Neutral for Bitcoin? The impact of this Bitcoin whale transfer on the market is subject to various interpretations. There isn’t a single, definitive answer, as the true intent of the whale remains unknown. Potentially Bearish: If the funds are being moved to an OTC desk or another platform for a large, private sale, it could indicate an upcoming increase in selling pressure. However, moving directly to an ‘unknown new wallet’ makes this less likely to cause immediate market impact unless further movements occur. Potentially Bullish: If the whale is moving their Bitcoin to cold storage, it signals a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value and a desire to hold, effectively reducing the liquid supply available on exchanges. This is often interpreted as a bullish signal. Neutral/Operational: As discussed, the transfer could simply be an internal re-organization, a security measure, or part of a larger, pre-arranged deal that won’t directly hit public exchanges. In such cases, the immediate market impact might be minimal. Ultimately, the market’s reaction will depend on subsequent actions from this whale. The crypto community will be watching closely for any further movements from this mysterious address. Navigating the Volatility: Strategies for the Savvy Crypto Investor In a market as dynamic and occasionally enigmatic as cryptocurrency, understanding how to react to significant events like a large Bitcoin whale transfer is crucial. Rather than succumbing to fear or irrational exuberance, a well-informed investor adopts a strategic approach. Here are some key strategies: Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your digital eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio can help mitigate risks associated with sudden movements in a single asset. Practice Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, invest a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps smooth out the impact of volatility. Set Clear Investment Goals and Risk Tolerance: Understand why you’re investing and how much risk you’re comfortable with. Stick to your plan. Utilize Stop-Loss Orders: For active traders, stop-loss orders can help limit potential losses if the market moves against your position unexpectedly. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always verify information and understand the underlying technology and fundamentals of the cryptocurrencies you invest in. Secure Your Assets: If you hold substantial amounts of crypto, consider moving them to a hardware wallet for cold storage, similar to what this whale might be doing. The Future of Large Bitcoin Transfers and Market Transparency As the cryptocurrency market matures, the ability to track and analyze on-chain data becomes increasingly sophisticated. Tools and services like Whale Alert continue to provide invaluable insights into the movements of large asset holders. While the anonymity of blockchain can be a double-edged sword, it also offers unprecedented transparency into transaction volumes and flows. Large Bitcoin whale transfers will undoubtedly continue to be a subject of fascination and analysis. They highlight the concentration of wealth in the crypto space and the potential for individual entities to influence market dynamics. As more institutions enter the space, we might see even larger, more frequent, and perhaps more transparent movements as part of regulated operations. The recent colossal Bitcoin whale transfer from Coinbase to an unknown wallet serves as a powerful reminder of the intriguing and often mysterious nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the immediate intentions behind this nearly billion-dollar move remain unconfirmed, it underscores the significant influence of large holders and the importance of on-chain monitoring. Whether it signals accumulation, a private sale, or an internal reorganization, such events invariably spark discussion and encourage a deeper understanding of market dynamics. For investors, it’s a call to remain vigilant, informed, and strategic, rather than reactive. The world of digital assets continues to evolve, and with it, the art of deciphering the silent, yet impactful, moves of its biggest players. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin whale? A Bitcoin whale is an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of Bitcoin. While there’s no official threshold, it typically refers to addresses holding thousands of BTC, giving them the potential to significantly influence market prices with their transactions. Why is this specific Bitcoin whale transfer significant? This transfer is significant due to its immense size (7,743 BTC, approximately $899 million) and its origin from a major exchange (Coinbase) to an unknown new wallet. Such large movements can signal major strategic decisions by large holders, potentially impacting market sentiment and supply dynamics. Does this transfer mean Bitcoin’s price will drop? Not necessarily. While a large transfer to an exchange could signal an intent to sell, this specific transfer was to an unknown, non-exchange wallet. It could indicate a move to cold storage for long-term holding (bullish), an OTC deal, or an internal reorganization, none of which directly imply an immediate price drop. How can I track large Bitcoin transactions like this? Services like Whale Alert (which reported this transaction), blockchain explorers (e.g., Blockchain.com, Blockchair), and on-chain analytics platforms (e.g., Glassnode, CryptoQuant) allow users to track and analyze large Bitcoin transactions and whale movements. What does ‘unknown new wallet’ mean in this context? ‘Unknown new wallet’ means the receiving address has no publicly identified owner or association with a known entity (like an exchange or a major company). It’s a newly created address with no prior transaction history, adding to the mystery of the transfer’s purpose. If you found this analysis insightful, consider sharing it with your network!

2025-07-25T18:04:43,"Ripple's lost 32,569 ledgers continues to feed conspiracy theories","Ripple’s earliest ledger data from its June 2012 launch is irretrievably incomplete due to a server bug that erased the headers for the first 32,569 ledgers. The significant gap in the XRP Ledger’s transaction history has the community asking where the pre-mined 100 billion XRP went. Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz addressed the incident in a 2012 Bitcoin forum post, stating, “Unfortunately, due to a server bug, some history was lost. You can’t trace all the way back to the genesis ledger. You can trace back to ledger 32,570.” However, questions continue to arise from time to time, especially in the wake of recent XRP sales by Ripple’s co-founder, Chris Larsen. Are Ripple’s early ledgers recoverable? Transactional content from the early ledgers still exists. Still, missing headers and metadata that link each ledger to the one before it break the cryptographic chain that verifies the integrity of blockchain records. Ripple Forum discussion of David Schwartz’s message on the deleted ledgers. Source: Forum.ripple.com According to a discussion among Ripple devs seen on the forum, developers and independent validators cannot fully reconstruct or authenticate the earliest 534 transactions on the XRP Ledger without those headers. XRP, like other blockchain systems, uses the hash of each preceding ledger to validate the next. The absence of those foundational links means that all current users of the XRP Ledger must accept the existing records on faith, trusting the individuals who operated the network during its first seven months. Do the lost ledgers matter? The period from June to December 2012 contains the most significant activity in XRP’s history, the pre-mining and initial distribution of all XRP coins. Unlike Bitcoin, which issues coins through mining, XRP’s 100 billion tokens were pre-mined by Ripple’s founders and distributed manually. Of those, 80% were allocated to Ripple companies to fund ongoing development, while the remaining 20% was retained by the founders themselves. The fact that these transactions lie within the now-unverifiable segment of the XRP Ledger is telling, and so far, none of the executives at Ripple have given a clear response on whether anything is being done to recover the ledgers. My favorite fact about $XRP is that the entire first week is missing from the ledger history and this is considered completely normal So 32569 ledgers (read: blocks) were lost forever and there's hundreds of Billion of Dollars of supply which u can't determine origin https://t.co/7TsGCF5nFp pic.twitter.com/NdWyiCSOBK — Wazz (@WazzCrypto) July 24, 2025 In a forum post from 2012, a Ripple developer conceded that backtracking through the ledger chain was nearly impossible. “There is no real way to trace back from 32,570, unfortunately,” they wrote. “32,569 contains the hash of 32,568 and that is definitely a much harder target to brute force.” Despite this, Ripple insiders insist that the situation is not as dire as it seems. “All history after the beta was opened is available,” Schwartz wrote in 2012. “All that was lost was the ledger headers, all the transactions are still available, so there’s some hope that the history may still be recovered.” Ripple can try reconstructing history, if it’s not impossible Although XRPL technical officers have reportedly been trying to recover or reconstruct the lost ledger headers over the years, they have not been successful. The main clue to the lost history is the header hash of ledger 32,569: 60A01EBF11537D8394EA1235253293508BDA7131D5F8710EFE9413AA129653A2, which is embedded in the verifiable header of ledger 32,570. According to developers, it is “problematic” to identify where individual transactions belong, especially if they lack metadata specifying their original ledger height. A brute-force approach to rebuilding the header chain would require substantial computational resources, alongside knowledge of how those early transactions were formatted. “Depending on how these old transactions are stored, it might be hard to find out in which exact ledger they were actually recorded,” one XRPL developer noted in a historical forum thread. “Still, if these old transactions don’t include their ledger height, there might be quite a bit more guesswork, or brute force, required.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-07-25T18:00:12,"Ethereum Rising: Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz Predicts ETH Will Outperform BTC – Here’s Why","After a notable bounce that took place earlier this month, Ethereum, the second-largest digital asset, is surging once again towards the key $4,000 price level. When the altcoin reclaims this level with the current bullish momentum, it is likely to witness a major rally, with popular figures predicting it could outperform Bitcoin this cycle. Galaxy CEO Banking On Ethereum Over Bitcoin Bitcoin, the flagship asset, may have witnessed a significant upward performance, reaching a new all-time high, but some prominent figures in the crypto market are betting more on Ethereum than BTC. Mike Novogratz , the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Galaxy Digital, has expressed optimism toward ETH, as he foresees a major rally in the short term. The long-term crypto advocate and billionaire has made a bold prediction, stating that Ethereum has a real shot at outperforming Bitcoin in this cycle. Although Bitcoin is still the most popular cryptocurrency store of value, ETH may outperform it due to its growing ecosystem and technological advancements. In the interview on CBNC Squawk Box, Novogratz asserted that he is a big believer in ETH and BTC, and he holds the two leading crypto assets. When asked which coin he would buy between the two, the investor expressed confidence in ETH, stating the altcoin is “caught up a lot” in the ongoing cycle. According to Novogratz, Ethereum seems likely to hit the $4,000 resistance level a few times before breaking past it. Meanwhile, if Ethereum takes out the crucial $4,000 mark, the investor believes the altcoin might enter a price discovery phase, which would lead to a major rally. Novogratz’s strong interest and optimism toward Ethereum rely on its narrative, which the investor claims is very powerful, while the market is extremely short-term. He also drew attention to the ongoing significant adoption of ETH by major treasury companies. Presently, two major treasury companies have accumulated the altcoin in large quantities, and another big treasury firm could be joining the race. This surge in institutional accumulation underscores a broader shift in how traditional markets view Ethereum . With these big companies purchasing ETH rapidly in large quantities, its available supply is drying up fast, which is mostly good for the price. Considering this supply shrink, the billionaire believes that ETH has a high likelihood of outpacing BTC in the next 3 to 6 months. Risk Of Short-Term Correction Remains Even though ETH seems poised for a rally , Crypto Dan, a market expert, has warned that the risk of a short-term correction still lingers, citing an overheating market. However, from a somewhat larger perspective, the current level is far too low when compared to the overheated futures market in March 2024 and November 2024. Should a correction occur, the expert stated that it will probably be brief and shallow, which represents a healthy pullback before a major rally. Despite being in an upcycle, ETH hit an undervalued zone and clearly touched the bottom, suggesting that the altcoin is likely to push toward even higher prices in the second half of 2025.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-will-outperform-bitcoin/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO|ENA","Ethereum|Altcoin|bitcoin|btc|CBNC Squawk Box|Crypto Dan|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Galaxy Digital|mike novogratz",cryptocompare
