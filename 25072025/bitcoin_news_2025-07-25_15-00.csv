2025-07-25T12:55:10,"Joseph Chalom’s Strategic Move: Former BlackRock Crypto Strategist Joins SharpLink","BitcoinWorld Joseph Chalom’s Strategic Move: Former BlackRock Crypto Strategist Joins SharpLink In a development poised to send ripples through the digital asset landscape, Joseph Chalom , a pivotal figure who spearheaded BlackRock’s digital asset and fintech strategy, has embarked on a new chapter. He has been appointed co-CEO of SharpLink, a company notably recognized as the largest corporate holder of Ethereum (ETH). This strategic move not only underscores the growing convergence of traditional finance with the burgeoning crypto sector but also highlights the increasing allure of decentralized technologies for seasoned institutional leaders. For those closely observing the evolution of cryptocurrencies, this news signifies more than just a change in executive roles; it represents a powerful endorsement of the crypto ecosystem’s maturity and potential. Joseph Chalom , with his deep expertise cultivated at one of the world’s largest asset managers, stepping into a leadership role at a crypto-native firm like SharpLink, speaks volumes about where the future of global finance is headed. Who is Joseph Chalom and What Was His Impact at BlackRock? Before his recent transition, Joseph Chalom was a name synonymous with innovation within the traditional finance giant, BlackRock. As the head of their digital asset and fintech strategy, he was at the forefront of exploring how a behemoth like BlackRock could navigate and eventually embrace the world of cryptocurrencies. His tenure was marked by significant milestones, most notably his instrumental role in the launch of BlackRock’s groundbreaking iShares Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. These ETFs were not just new financial products; they were a testament to BlackRock’s strategic pivot towards legitimizing digital assets for mainstream investors. Chalom’s work involved intricate regulatory navigation, market analysis, and the development of robust frameworks to bring these complex assets into a traditional investment vehicle. His departure from BlackRock in June, following these successful launches, signaled a readiness for new challenges within the very industry he helped usher into institutional view. His insights, particularly his description of Ethereum as a ‘growing foundation of global finance,’ reveal a profound understanding and belief in the transformative power of blockchain technology beyond mere speculative assets. This perspective is crucial as he steps into a role at a company deeply invested in the Ethereum ecosystem. Understanding SharpLink: A Key Player in the Ethereum Ecosystem SharpLink might not be a household name to everyone, but within the crypto community, it holds a significant position. The company is recognized as the largest corporate holder of Ethereum (ETH), a fact that immediately places it at the heart of the institutional adoption narrative for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Co-founded by Rob Phythian, SharpLink has positioned itself as a major stakeholder in the Ethereum network, likely engaging in various activities such as staking, decentralized finance (DeFi) participation, or strategic investments in projects built on Ethereum. Their substantial ETH holdings indicate a long-term conviction in Ethereum’s potential as a foundational layer for the next generation of the internet and global finance. This commitment aligns perfectly with Joseph Chalom’s publicly expressed views on Ethereum’s future, creating a powerful synergy between his vision and SharpLink’s established presence. Why is Joseph Chalom’s Move to SharpLink So Significant? The appointment of Joseph Chalom as co-CEO alongside Rob Phythian at SharpLink is far more than just executive reshuffling; it’s a potent signal of the ongoing maturation of the crypto industry. Here’s why this move is particularly noteworthy: Bridging TradFi and Crypto: Chalom’s background at BlackRock provides an invaluable bridge between the traditional financial world and the innovative, often disruptive, crypto space. His understanding of institutional requirements, risk management, and regulatory landscapes will be crucial for SharpLink’s growth and its interactions with mainstream finance. Validation of Ethereum: For Ethereum enthusiasts and investors, Chalom’s move serves as a strong validation. His belief in ETH as a ‘growing foundation of global finance’ is now backed by his direct involvement with a major ETH holder, potentially inspiring further institutional confidence and investment. Strategic Growth for SharpLink: With Chalom’s strategic acumen, SharpLink is poised to expand its influence and operations within the Ethereum ecosystem. This could involve deeper dives into DeFi, NFTs, or other Web3 initiatives, leveraging Chalom’s experience in scaling financial products. Talent Migration Trend: This move is part of a broader trend where top talent from traditional finance institutions are increasingly migrating to crypto-native companies. They bring with them not just expertise but also a different operational mindset, paving the way for more sophisticated and compliant crypto ventures. The synergy between Chalom’s institutional insights and SharpLink’s deep crypto native expertise creates a formidable leadership team, ready to navigate the complexities and capitalize on the opportunities within the digital asset space. What Are the Broader Implications for Ethereum and Institutional Adoption? The implications of Joseph Chalom’s new role extend far beyond SharpLink itself. His move could accelerate the institutional adoption of Ethereum in several ways: Implication Description Increased Legitimacy A high-profile executive from BlackRock joining a crypto firm lends significant credibility to the space, particularly to Ethereum, encouraging other institutional players to explore it more seriously. Enhanced Infrastructure Development Chalom’s experience in building robust financial products could lead SharpLink to develop more sophisticated infrastructure and services around Ethereum, making it more accessible and appealing for large-scale corporate and institutional use. Regulatory Dialogue With Chalom’s understanding of regulatory environments, SharpLink might play a more active role in shaping favorable regulatory frameworks for Ethereum and other digital assets, reducing uncertainty for potential institutional entrants. Market Confidence Boost News of such talent migration often boosts investor confidence, signaling a positive outlook for the asset class and potentially attracting more capital into Ethereum-based projects and investments. This development signifies a growing confidence among traditional finance leaders in the long-term viability and transformative power of blockchain technology, especially Ethereum. It suggests that institutions are not just looking to dabble in crypto but are actively seeking to integrate it into their core strategies. Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities for Joseph Chalom and SharpLink While the move presents immense opportunities, Joseph Chalom and SharpLink will undoubtedly face challenges in this evolving landscape. Integrating a traditional finance mindset with the fast-paced, often unpredictable crypto world requires adaptability. Regulatory uncertainties, market volatility, and the need for continuous innovation will test their leadership. However, these challenges are dwarfed by the potential opportunities. SharpLink, under Chalom’s co-leadership, could become a trailblazer in institutional crypto strategies, setting new benchmarks for how large entities engage with decentralized networks. Their position as a major ETH holder gives them a unique vantage point to influence and benefit from Ethereum’s ongoing development, including its scalability upgrades and increasing utility in various sectors like enterprise blockchain, tokenization of real-world assets, and the metaverse. The combination of Chalom’s strategic foresight and SharpLink’s operational expertise positions them to unlock new avenues for growth and cement Ethereum’s role as a cornerstone of the future financial system. This partnership could serve as a blueprint for other traditional finance executives looking to make a meaningful impact in the digital asset space. The journey of Joseph Chalom from BlackRock to SharpLink is a compelling narrative of how the lines between traditional finance and the decentralized crypto world are blurring. His strategic move not only elevates SharpLink’s profile but also reinforces the growing institutional conviction in Ethereum’s foundational role in global finance. As more seasoned professionals from established financial institutions make similar transitions, the crypto industry is poised for an era of unprecedented growth, sophistication, and integration into the broader economic fabric. This development is a clear indicator that the future of finance is undoubtedly hybrid, blending the best of both worlds. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Who is Joseph Chalom?

Here's Why! – He Also Gave a Date!","Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz, known for his support of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, made ambitious statements. Appearing on CNBC's Squawk Box program, Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz argued that Ethereum could soon surpass Bitcoin. Referring to Ethereum's recent surge, Novogratz said that the rapid increase in institutional interest in ETH could lead to a supply shock and ETH could overtake Bitcoin in the next three to six months. The famous name stating that Ethereum could reach $4,000 very soon said: “I think Ethereum has a good chance of surpassing Bitcoin in the next three to six months, Because ETH's story is really strong and ETH has recovered very quickly.” Novogratz, noting that large companies' treasury strategies are helping Ethereum rally, said, “Public companies are copying Strategy's (formerly MicroStrategy) Bitcoin treasury model. But they're buying ETH instead of BTC. They're raising capital every day and buying ETH, which is driving ETH's strength.” Novogratz also revealed his Bitcoin prediction, adding that the price could reach $150,000 this year. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes also predicted that Bitcoin could reach $250,000 by the end of the year, while Ethereum could reach $10,000. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-25T12:41:11,"Galaxy Digital lead market makers taking profit and offloading BTC on the open market","Market makers were one of the most influential wallets in the past day, adding to the pressure on the price of BTC. While whales generally hold onto their BTC, market makers posted multiple transactions big enough to sway the price. BTC declined to a two-week low, recently dipping as low as $115,000. The leading coin took a step back based on long liquidations. However, the spot market also played a significant role, as market makers emptied some of their reserves on the market. Spot markets had to absorb additional inflows from Galaxy Digital , with smaller inflows from Jump Crypto. Wintermute also activated its wallets after receiving inflows from Binance. The activities of the market makers had wider repercussions, as they triggered some of the recent liquidations. Demand and holding for BTC remained strong, as ETFs and treasuries keep buying. However, the directed, short-term selling of market makers is still a factor for fluctuations of a few thousand dollars. Galaxy Digital leads the selling trend The past day has seen significant outflows from Galaxy Digital’s reserves, reaching exchanges for direct sales. On-chain data shows the crypto custodial service and market maker moved a total of 30,000 BTC, with most sent to exchange hot wallets. The markets had to absorb up to $3.5B in new BTC inflows. Galaxy Digital now stores $1.15B in stablecoins. Update: #GalaxyDigital has transferred nearly 30,000 $BTC ($3.5B) out today, most of which went directly to exchanges and were sold. Then #GalaxyDigital withdrew 1.15B $USDT from exchanges. #GalaxyDigital still holds 18,504 $BTC ($2.14B). https://t.co/bVtNwP2iXI pic.twitter.com/Wv1cD3aHbf — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 25, 2025 Galaxy Digital was also the recipient of funds from one of the recent high-profile whales. The early buyer moved 80,000 BTC , some acquired at under $1. After moving the coins to new addresses, the whale deposited all the funds to Galaxy Digital. On-chain investigators noted that the market maker managed to place up to 70,000 BTC on exchanges, with 10K remaining as part of the remaining balance on Galaxy Digital. Galaxy Digital placed some of the BTC through BitStamp , an exchange widely used during previous bull cycles. Market makers cut their BTC reserves Other market makers also saw outflows of their BTC reserves. Jump Crypto sold hundreds of BTC in the past days, and is down from 1.3K BTC to 894 BTC. Cumberland also continued to send BTC to multiple exchanges, especially Gemini. The market maker is down to 62 BTC in one of its hot wallets. One of the most influential market makers is still Wintermute. Previously its founder Evgeny Gaevoy stated the marker maker ran out of BTC on its OTC market. However, Wintermute never goes without the BTC it needs for market making activities. According to the Arkham Intelligence on-chain data, Wintermute kept receiving BTC from Binance in the past 24 hours. The coins may be used for spot activities, as most traders have noted Wintermute’s effect on BTC rallies. Previous critics have noted Wintermute has used its reserves to force liquidations and market capitulation, allowing whales to buy lower. Other BTC holders also continue sending coins to markets. In the past day, 91,119 BTC may have entered the market, originating from unidentified whales, BTC custodians, exchanges, and other holders.

2025-07-25T12:35:56,"Robert Kiyosaki Recommends Owning Real BTC, Not ‘Paper’ ETFs","The Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) market is expanding and raking in billions of dollars in capital. Despite this growth demonstrating rising adoption of the leading digital asset, finance guru Robert Kiyosaki believes ETFs are for the average investor. Unfortunately, Kiyosaki thinks it is unwise to remain an average investor because such market participants are restricted to paper investments and not the real deal. Own Real BTC, Not Paper In his latest tweet praising Bitcoin, Kiyosaki urged his followers to be wary of ETFs, which he referred to as “paper.” The American entrepreneur stated that he has come to realize that ETFs simplify the investing experience for the average investor. So, he recommends such products, but with caution. While the average investor can invest their capital in Bitcoin, silver, and gold ETFs, Kiyosaki advises that they should know when it’s time to go for real assets. The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad likened owning ETFs to having pictures of guns for personal defense. In essence, such holdings are useless in the face of danger. “Sometimes it’s best to have real gold, silver, Bitcoin, and a gun. Know the differences when it is best to have real and when it’s best to have paper,” the entrepreneur stated. According to the businessman, understanding the difference between ETFs and real assets, as well as how to leverage them, makes an investor better than average. An Easy Way to Get Rich Over the years, Kiyosaki has become a Bitcoin bull and advocate, constantly urging his followers to buy BTC and precious metals. The author believes the United States dollar is doomed and that millions of Americans holding the fiat currency will be financially wiped out when it collapses. However, BTC, gold, and silver holders will remain afloat. Two months ago, Kiyosaki went as far as stating that bitcoin has made it so easy for anyone to get rich, as the asset obeys the two most important laws of money. He insisted that most people will remain poor for as long as they hold onto assets that violate these laws. While the U.S. economy faces the risk of collapse in the long term, Kiyosaki sees bitcoin’s value skyrocketing to $1 million. Even when BTC eventually reaches that level, the finance guru says he will continue to buy the digital asset, so as not to regret not accumulating more when the price goes higher.

2025-07-25T12:30:00,"Top XRP Price Prediction For 2025","The post Top XRP Price Prediction For 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News With XRP recently breaking past $3.60 and sparking fresh excitement, analysts are dropping some bold new targets for where the token could be headed next. From $13 to as high as $30, here’s what the experts are saying, and when they think it might happen. Here are the top XRP Price Predictions . What target are you looking at? Zach Rector: $20 to $30 Cycle Top, But Caution Ahead The 4 year crypto cycles have been disrupted but people are still going to take profits. Which is why I still believe after a $20-$30 XRP top we will see atleast a 50% correction. Not encouraging folks to trade this move but instead, just making sure you are ready to stomach that… — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) July 22, 2025 XRP community figure Zach Rector believes the token has the momentum to hit between $20 and $30 in this bull cycle. However, he also expects a sharp correction to follow, possibly wiping out 50% of those gains. He’s not against the bullish hype but reminds investors that market cycles and human emotions, especially profit-taking, still drive price reversals, no matter how much the space matures. EGRAG: Take Profit on the Way Up, Don’t Wait for $50 #XRP – Just DO IT (UPDATE): This post could be your roadmap to taking profits! My subscribers know how much I emphasize the Dollar Sell Average. Don’t get caught waiting for specific numbers like $27, $17, or even $50. Trust me, no one really knows where we’re headed;… https://t.co/zL46GFAwdq pic.twitter.com/aHxkOy3ncR — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) July 25, 2025 Analyst EGRAG is calling for a more strategic approach. He says XRP could top anywhere from $7 to $30, depending on market conditions, but urges holders to avoid chasing moonshot targets blindly. According to his technicals, the first sell zone lands between $4 and $6, the most realistic peak sits around $11 to $13, and the highest-end projection falls between $27 and $30. Instead of hoping for the perfect top, EGRAG recommends selling gradually using a Dollar Sell Averaging strategy. Tony Severino: Quick Run to $13 Within 40 Days Tony Severino is feeling confident that XRP could spike fast. He believes the token has broken out of a long-term triangle pattern and could mirror its 2018 rally with a quick move to $13, possibly in as little as 40 days. His forecast is among the shortest timelines shared so far. CasiTrades: $26 Possible by Year-End Yes, that could happen… If XRP has the strength to break towards $13, then the final 5th high could reach as high as $26. — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) June 30, 2025 CasiTrades initially targeted a July peak of $6.50 to $8, but with market momentum growing, they’ve now extended their target. If XRP keeps moving strongly, they expect the token could reach as high as $26 before the end of the year. The forecast depends on continued bullish sentiment and no major macro headwinds. Ripple Researcher Van Wickle: XRP to $14 With Bitcoin at $140K Ripple-focused researcher Van Wickle ties XRP’s potential to Bitcoin’s path. He believes XRP could touch $14 if BTC hits around $140,000. While not putting a strict deadline on the move, the correlation-based outlook suggests this may align with the broader market top. Armando Pantoja: $25 in Two Years Tech investor Armando Pantoja is taking the longer view, predicting XRP could hit $25 within the next two years. He dismisses concerns about market cap limitations and says real-world adoption and utility will drive the price higher over time. In short, while XRP might have a huge run ahead, the smartest move is to plan, take profits when they make sense, and be ready for any twist the market throws your way. Though timelines and expectations vary, most analysts agree that the ride could be explosive, but not without corrections along the way. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-25T12:20:01,"Bitcoin sa dnes ráno prepadol na 115 000 $. Je vhodný čas na nákup?","V piatok ráno došlo na kryptomenovom trhu k výraznému odpredaju, ktorý mal za následok likvidáciu dlhých pozícií v celkovej hodnote viac ako 585 miliónov dolárov . Hlavným dôvodom bola prudká korekcia ceny Bitcoinu, ktorá sa prepadla pod hranicu 115 000 dolárov . Expirácia júlových opcií na Bitcoine zvýšila odpredaje Nedávna expirácia mesačných opcií na burze Deribit priniesla ďalšiu vlnu volatility. Cena $BTC klesla do pásma okolo 115 000 $. Hoci expirácia bola o niečo nižšia v porovnaní s minulým mesiacom, trh zostáva mimoriadne volatilný a pohyby na derivátových trhoch sa premietajú aj do spotových cien. Options Expiry Alert Tomorrow, over $15.4B in BTC and ETH options are set to expire on Deribit. $BTC : $12.66B notional | Put/Call: 0.88 | Max Pain: $112K $ETH : $2.75B notional | Put/Call: 0.87 | Max Pain: $2,800 Last month’s H1 expiry hit $17B. This week’s is not far… pic.twitter.com/5nFSk7qDPg — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) July 24, 2025 Je evidentné, že expirácia opcií vytvorila dodatočný tlak na hodnotu Bitcoinu. Počas kľúčových hodín pred expiráciou sa Bitcoin obchodoval na úrovni 115 549 $. Cena sa neúprosne približovala k takzvanej hladine Max Pain, na úrovni 112 000 dolárov. Ide o úroveň, pri ktorej sa najväčší počet kontraktov označí ako „nevýherný“. V takomto prípade sú vo výhode vypisovatelia opcií. Deribit v najnovšej správe informoval, že hodnota všetkých expirovaných opcií dosiahla tento mesiac 15,45 miliardy dolárov. Bitcoinové opcie mali hodnotu 12,66 miliardy dolárov a Ethereum 2,75 miliardy $. Preskúmať funkcie bitcoinovej peňaženky Best Wallet K výraznej zmene sentimentu obchodníkov však nedošlo Aj napriek nedávnemu poklesu mnohí obchodníci sú optimistickí.

Analytici z Bitfinexu zase v najnovšej trhovej správe uviedli, že ak sa trhová štruktúra na Bitcoine výrazne nezmení, aktívum môže pokračovať v raste na ďalšiu významnú métu až 136 000 dolárov.

The corporate adoption wave spans multiple sectors and geographies, as firms seek alternatives to traditional cash management amid concerns about inflation and currency volatility. European Companies Lead Bitcoin Treasury Adoption Surge Swedish companies have spearheaded European Bitcoin adoption, with H100 Group achieving 510.28 Bitcoin holdings through aggressive July purchases totaling over 309 coins. The health technology company transformed into Sweden’s first publicly listed Bitcoin treasury firm and secured a listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Similarly, Fragbite Group launched its Bitcoin strategy by purchasing 4.3 Bitcoin at $112,958 per coin, raising 6 million Swedish krona through interest-free convertible loans. The gaming company’s move positions it as an early pioneer in the revolutionary digital asset space.

Galaxy Digital sparked concerns by offloading 10,000 Bitcoins worth $1.18 billion , further pressuring markets. Over $721 million in leveraged positions were liquidated in 24 hours, with Ethereum leading at $163.9 million, followed by Bitcoin at $155.5 million. The largest single liquidation occurred on OKX’s Bitcoin market, valued at $17.35 million.

2025-07-25T12:17:09,"Ethereum ETFs See $6.4B Inflows Over 11 Weeks as Investor Optimism Surges","Ethereum ETFs are enjoying a sustained bull run, clocking 11 straight weeks of net inflows totaling more than $6.4 billion. Key Takeaways: Ethereum ETFs have pulled in $6.4 billion over 11 straight weeks, outpacing Bitcoin funds. Fidelity’s ETHA hit $10B in assets in just 10 days, the third-fastest ETF to do so. Institutional ETH demand is rising amid stablecoin growth and renewed price momentum. The surge represents nearly 72% of the $8.9 billion raised by these products since their debut in the US last year, according to data from SoSoValue . Momentum has picked up sharply in recent days, with Ethereum ETFs consistently outdrawing Bitcoin rivals. Ether ETFs Outpace Bitcoin With $2.4B Inflows in Just Six Days Nate Geraci, president of ETFStore, noted that Ether-based funds attracted $2.4 billion in new investments over the past six trading days, compared to just $830 million for Bitcoin ETFs. Fidelity’s ETHA fund has been the standout, ballooning from $5 billion to $10 billion in just 10 days. Very small sample size… But spot eth ETFs have taken in more new $$$ than spot btc ETFs each of past 6 trading days. $2.4bil vs $830mil total. Noticeable difference. Something to watch. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 25, 2025 Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas described the growth as “the ETF asset equivalent of a God candle,” noting that ETHA is now the third-fastest ETF to reach the $10 billion milestone, behind only BlackRock and Fidelity’s Bitcoin offerings. While Bitcoin ETFs still dominate in overall assets, Ethereum’s rise is narrowing the gap and hinting at changing investor sentiment. For many, Ether funds are becoming a preferred vehicle to tap into Ethereum’s rally without the complications of direct token custody. The turnaround in ETH’s price, from April lows near $1,400 to around $3,600, has added fuel to the fire. Analysts say renewed investor interest is being driven partly by the U.S. push toward stablecoin regulation. LOOK OUT: $ETHA just hit $10b in one year flat, the 3rd fastest ETF to hit that mark in history after (you guessed it) two bitcoin ETFs $IBIT & $FBTC . Amazingly it went from $5b to $10b in just 10 days (ETF asset equiv of a God candle). Is in Top 5 in flows 1M, 1W. Sister Hazel! pic.twitter.com/Jrrb15BdHV — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 24, 2025 With over half of the $265 billion stablecoin market operating on Ethereum, the network’s role in digital finance appears more critical than ever. Matthew Dibb, CIO of Astronaut Capital, highlighted stablecoin growth and Circle’s IPO momentum as key reasons for institutional Ethereum accumulation. Meanwhile, long-time Ethereum bull Arthur Hayes has called for a $10,000 ETH price this year, with others eyeing $7,000 as a more conservative but increasingly feasible target. Institutional interest in Ethereum has surged in recent weeks. BitMine Immersion Technologies recently acquired $2 billion worth of ETH over a 16-day span, making it the largest corporate holder of Ethereum. In total, corporate treasuries now hold 2.31 million ETH, representing 1.91% of the asset’s circulating supply, according to Strategic Ether Reserves. 95% Approval Chance for Spot Solana, XRP ETFS As reported, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analysts have assigned a 95% chance that the SEC will approve spot ETFs for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin this year, raising their previous odds from 90% amid growing optimism for institutional crypto products. They also expect a crypto index ETF tracking multiple assets could gain approval as early as this week, signaling broader access to altcoins for traditional investors. Beyond ETFs, institutional Bitcoin demand is spreading into corporate treasuries. As reported, Singapore-headquartered edtech firm Genius Group has doubled its Bitcoin holdings to 200 BTC after acquiring 20 BTC last week, part of a wider strategy to build a 10,000-BTC treasury.

2025-07-25T12:12:49,"Why Is Crypto Down Today? – July 25, 2025","Over the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has dropped by another 5.1%, moving further away from the recently reached $4 trillion, now standing at $3.84 trillion. Overall, the market is down today. The majority of the top 100 coins per market capitalization are still red since yesterday. At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $225 billion. It has maintained similar levels for several days now. TLDR: Crypto market cap has distanced further from the recently hit $4 trillion; More coins among the top 100 are green today compared to yesterday, but the majority are still red; BTC is down to $115,282, and ETH is up to $3,621; Market sentiment continues decreasing, indicating rising caution; US ETH spot ETFs continued the inflow streak with the 15th day in a row; US BTC spot ETFs resumed positive flows; ’The current period of sideways movement in BTC has weakened investor enthusiasm and triggered profit-taking’; The correction seems to be a healthy pause within a larger upward trend; Metrics suggest early stages of capital rotation into altcoins. Crypto Winners & Losers Unlike yesterday, when all top 10 coins per market capitalization were red, five are green today and three are red (not counting the two stablecoins). Bitcoin (BTC) decreased by 2% in a day, now trading at $115,282. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) is up by 1.9% over the same period. It’s now trading at $3,621. Tron (TRX) increased the most: 3.6% to the price of $0.3148. On the other hand, Solana (SOL) fell the most: 2.8%, currently changing hands at $177.57. In the top 100 coins category, around 25 coins are green, which is a notable increase from yesterday’s four. Two of these recorded double-digit increases. Ethena (ENA) is up 14.8% to $0.4933, while Curve DAO (CRV) appreciated 11.3% to $1.02. Notably, the decreases are not very high. The highest of these is Mantle (MNT)’s 3.5%, now standing at $0.7354. Jupiter (JUP) follows with a 2.9% drop to $0.5243. Also, over 24 hours, over $721 million in leveraged crypto bets were liquidated, with Ethereum, Bitcoin, and XRP at the top. Investor attention was also focused on Galaxy Digital , as it transferred a whopping 17,123 BTC to multiple centralised exchanges over 12 hours. Note that #GalaxyDigital has deposited over 10,000 $BTC ($1.18B) to exchanges in the past 8 hours! The 10,000+ $BTC comes from the Bitcoin OG holding 80,009 $BTC ($9.68B). https://t.co/qaSj0NKwmD pic.twitter.com/09XEqB6VGg — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 25, 2025 Meanwhile, Strategy , the company with the largest Bitcoin treasury, has reportedly expanded its STRC preferred stock offering to $2 billion . This is the result of surging investor interest in gaining exposure to BTC through traditional vehicles. BREAKING: Michael Saylor's STRATEGY plans to raise $2B for Bitcoin purchases, upsizing from $500M. pic.twitter.com/E5q9UggoCq — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) July 24, 2025 Moreover, Christie’s International Real Estate has launched a dedicated crypto division comprising lawyers, analysts, and crypto experts. “The trend was obvious – crypto is here to stay. It’s only going to get bigger over the next few years,” Christie’s CEO Aaron Kirman said. ‘Pullback May Be a Temporary Correction Rather Than a Reversal’ Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at EU-based Web3 platform YouHodler , commented that Bitcoin’s “prolonged consolidation phase has led to a broader market correction across major altcoins.” Following several weeks of bullish momentum, significant gains, and all-time highs, “the current period of sideways movement in BTC has weakened investor enthusiasm and triggered profit-taking across the cryptocurrency sector.” “However, from a technical analysis standpoint, the overall market structure remains bullish, suggesting the recent pullback may be more of a temporary correction than a reversal.” That said, despite short-term price weakness, the medium-term outlook for the crypto market remains constructive, and broader financial markets still show optimism, Lienkha writes. “Investor appetite for risk assets remains strong, driven by a favorable macroeconomic environment, low recession risks, and ongoing capital flows into equities and digital assets,” he says. Source: Ledn Therefore, the current correction seems to be a healthy pause within a larger upward trend. Unless a major shock occurs, BTC and major altcoins are likely to resume their upward momentum over the coming weeks. “The technical picture, including higher lows on longer timeframes and strong on-chain fundamentals, continues to support the bull market thesis.” But Lienkha warns that the long-term outlook is becoming more uncertain. Factors include inflation, escalating trade tensions, and new tariff measures – all related to the US. Gadi Chait, Head of Investment at Xapo Bank , adds that the crypto market momentum has cooled following last week’s positive regulation news. However, “the fundamentals of ETF flows, institutional accumulation, and capital flight to a new decentralized home remain.” Bitcoin’s market share (~60%) has seen “only modest fluctuations despite the growth of alternative cryptocurrencies.” This is a minor decrease from previous highs, suggesting the early stages of capital rotation into altcoins. This is a typical pattern during bull market phases. Moreover, the total market capitalization surpassing $4 trillion “reflects not just speculative interest but a fundamental shift in how value is stored, transferred, and programmed in the digital age.” Chait continues: “As the market evolves, the interplay between Bitcoin’s stability as ‘digital gold’ and Ethereum’s utility as a platform for innovation continues to shape institutional investment strategies. While altcoin seasons may offer opportunities for enhanced returns, Bitcoin’s dominance and established position suggest it will remain the anchor of institutional crypto portfolios for the foreseeable future.” You may also like: One Year of US Spot Ethereum ETFs – How Far Have They Come and What’s Next?

By the time of writing, it hadn’t recovered much. Investors are now looking to see if the price will further dip below $115,000. Alternatively, as the bull market continues, the price may also recover above $118,000 over the next couple of days. Bitcoin Price Chart.

ETH has seen notable and consistent increases over the past couple of weeks. It now seems to be working to reclaim the $3,750 level. Should this happen, it could continue rising to $3,850. Furthermore, the crypto market sentiment has dropped today again, now standing at the border of the natural territory, but still in greed. It stands at 66 today , compared to 67 yesterday. The sentiment remains overall positive, but it’s moving towards increased caution. Meanwhile, the US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) cut the red streak with inflows of $226.61 million on 24 July. Six funds saw positive flows, and none saw outflows. Fidelity is at the top with $106.58 million. This is followed by VanEck’s $46.36 million. Untypically for BlackRock , it took third place on Thursday with $32.49 million. At the same time, US ETH ETFs continued the green streak with 15 consecutive days of positive flows, possibly moving towards a record. The Thursday inflows amounted to $231.23 million . Four funds recorded positive flows, with Fidelity leading this list again, taking in $210.06 million. On the other hand, $18.54 million flowed out of Grayscale. Per Ledn’s Lienkha, economists expect the impact of the US tariffs “to be delayed, likely showing up in the data in the coming months. When they do, they could further fuel inflation and introduce renewed volatility into both traditional and crypto markets.” “Investors should also be aware that rising inflation and trade friction could prompt central banks to reassess their current policy stance,” Lienkha warns. “Any hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve , such as delaying rate cuts or keeping rates higher for longer, may put pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.” Meanwhile, digital asset platform OSL Group has raised $300 million through an equity financing round. This is the largest publicly disclosed capital raise in Asia’s crypto space. “The funding will accelerate our global build-out – particularly in regulated stablecoin infrastructure and compliant payment rails,” said Ivan Wong, CFO of OSL Group.

The crypto market decreased over the last 24 hours, while the stock market indexes closed mixed on Thursday. The S&P 500 is up by 0.7%, the Nasdaq-100 increased by 0.25%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.7%. This was the result of the ongoing tariff deal saga in the US, as well as major tech companies publishing quarterly results. Is this dip sustainable? This dip still appears to be typical, and there is more room for another leg up. However, several major macro elements coming from the US could be impacting the markets soon – specifically tariffs, inflation, and a hawkish Fed stance – and these may pull the prices down, leading to a larger correction.

2025-07-25T12:08:45,"Monster $15 billion Bitcoin short  squeeze alert","It appears that a surge in upside liquidity suggests that Bitcoin ( BTC ) could be gearing up for another short squeeze . While the cryptocurrency is trading at over $116,738, nearly $15 billion in leveraged short positions on exchanges like Binance , Bybit, and OKX is now exposed heading into the weekend, according to the latest data from CoinGlass retrieved on July 25. The liquidation heatmap also reveals a dense buildup of potential buybacks that could propel the asset higher if it breaches the $120,000 resistance zone. For the sake of clarification, the chart below highlights the areas with the highest concentration of leveraged positions, as well as the areas where those positions are most at risk. The rising green curve on the right side indicates the level of short liquidation leverage, showing where traders are most likely to be wiped out. BTC exchange liquidation map. Source: CoinGlass Observing the data, we see the curve rising more rapidly past the $120,000 mark, where a large cluster of leveraged liquidity is concentrated. As soon as BTC begins approaching those levels, it could set off a chain reaction, trapping late short sellers and launching the cryptocurrency even higher. Put simply, the chart reveals just how much capital is currently betting against Bitcoin rising. If BTC moves higher, these short positions will start losing money, and if it climbs fast enough, exchanges will begin automatically liquidating them. Usually, when shorts are forced to close, the event triggers buy orders as traders have to purchase more Bitcoin to cover their positions. That sudden wave of buying pressure typically drives the price even higher, causing a cascade of additional liquidations, as we have observed during the 2020 and 2021 short squeezes. Bitcoin short liquidation leverage summary At first glance, the chart might look overwhelming, but it simply pinpoints where leveraged traders are most vulnerable. Right now, the traders in the danger zone are those betting against Bitcoin going up past more or less $120,000. Of course, there is no guarantee that BTC will really rise, but the $14.69 billion in short exposure is still a bullish indicator because it shows how volatile the current price is. That is, if a strong enough growth catalyst appears, the price changes that follow could potentially be sudden and explosive instead of gradual.

While the market appears strong, analysts and users are debating whether the traditional 4-year cycle theory still holds or if a new era, led by institutions and long-term holders, is taking shape. Are Classic Market Signals Breaking Down? Analyst Ki Young Ju recently shared that for years, he has followed a clear pattern: buying when whales (big players) accumulate, and selling when retail investors join in. However, he claims that this pattern was once a reliable indicator for market timing, but it does not work anymore. #Bitcoin cycle theory is dead. My predictions were based on it—buy when whales accumulate, sell when retail joins. But that pattern no longer holds. Last cycle, whales sold to retail. This time, old whales sell to new long-term whales. Institutional adoption is bigger than we… — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) July 24, 2025 In the last bull run, whales were selling to retail. But this time, he points out that older whales are selling to newer, long-term holders. A lot of these new players are likely institutions. The institutional adoptions have been much bigger than what many had expected. This time, it’s not just traders that are playing the game; holders have taken over. He notes that he was applying the old cycle framework to a new kind of market. He adds that he called the bull cycle over too early and did not fully recognize how much the structure had changed. He also apologised for the ones impacted by his precious forecast and committed that he will now focus on delivering more data-driven insights. Institutions Driving The Rally Institutional adoption has been the driving force behind this Bitcoin cycle. Regulated funds and ETFs have bought over 900,000 BTC, way more than what big whales are selling, which has helped keep the price steady. Cryptoquant analysts also note that the Bitcoin rally is not due to retail hype, but institutions are leading the way. On-chain data shows retail investors have been selling since early 2023, with their BTC holdings steadily declining. In contrast, large wallets, likely ETFs, funds, or institutions, started accumulating heavily in early 2024. Google trends show that the interest in “Bitcoin” is still pretty low, with no retail FOMO and hype like in 2021. However, analyst Willy Woo says not to be fooled by the Google trends. He claims that people now already know Bitcoin, and low search does not mean low demand.

What Should Investors Expect?","Bitcoin (BTC), followed by Ethereum (ETH), and altcoins have experienced significant gains in recent days. However, as upward momentum slowed, BTC and ETH entered a consolidation phase following their rallies. While the bullish mood in the market is expected to continue, the expiration date for option contracts in the crypto market has come today, as it does every Friday. These options are more important because they fall on the last Friday of both the week and the month. According to data for the fourth week of July, $12.3 billion worth of Bitcoin and $2.7 billion worth of Ethereum options will expire on July 25 on the Deribit derivatives exchange. Accordingly, the Put/Call Ratio of BTC options is 0.88, the maximum loss point is $112,000 and the notional value is $12.66 billion. When we look at Ethereum, ETH options have a Put/Call Ratio of 0.87, a maximum loss point of $2,800, and a notional value of $2.75 billion. The maximum pain point is the level at which the cryptocurrency price settles at a certain value as an option approaches its expiration date, resulting in significant losses for the largest number of option traders. At this point, significant volatility could be seen in Bitcoin's price following the $12.66 billion options expiration on July 25th. While the maximum pain point is at $112,000 for BTC and $2,800 for Ethereum, investors could push prices to this level through market manipulation, as market prices are above the maximum pain point. Derivatives trading platform Greeks Live noted in its weekly analysis that market sentiment remains bearish. Analysts noted that investors tended to increase their put positions rather than reduce them, despite the fact that 90 percent of them suffered losses. Analysts said that investors expected a decline due to increased volatility and focused on possible downward movements. “Despite the large losses on put positions, investors are observed to continue increasing their positions.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-25T12:02:31,"Over $585M in Crypto Longs Liquidated as Bitcoin Falls Below $116,000","The crypto market witnessed heavy liquidations on Friday, with over half a billion dollars in long positions wiped out as Bitcoin price slipped below $116,000 amid a broader market decline. According to data from CoinGlass, $585.86 million worth of long positions were liquidated, with Bitcoin accounting for $140.06 million of the total as it dropped 2.63% to $115,356. Ether also faced sharp liquidations, with $104.76 million in longs cleared as the price fell 1.33% to $3,598. Dogecoin recorded the largest percentage drop among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, plunging 7% over 24 hours to $0.22 and triggering $26 million in liquidations. Market Faces Leverage Flush as Bitcoin Bulls Get Caught The sudden downturn, described by crypto trader Ash Crypto as a “pure leverage flush,” caught many traders off guard. “Many people longed Alts after they saw ETH pumping hard, so market makers dumped and liquidated the late longs,” Ash Crypto explained on X. In total, 213,729 traders were liquidated during the market drop, illustrating the high levels of leverage in recent trading activity amid the bullish momentum that had driven Bitcoin to a new all-time high of $123,100 on July 14. Across both short and long positions, approximately $731.93 million was cleared from the market, underscoring the volatility that continues to characterize crypto trading. Despite the pullback, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index maintained a “Greed” score of 70 on Friday, indicating continued optimism among market participants. Sentiment Remains Bullish Despite Liquidations Several crypto leaders and analysts remain positive on the market’s direction despite the flush of leveraged positions. Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz stated on Thursday that he expects Ether to reach $4,000 amid rising institutional adoption . Meanwhile, Bitfinex analysts noted in a report that Bitcoin’s next major target could be $136,000 if the current uptrend persists. However, traders are exercising caution, hedging against the possibility of a swift reversal in Bitcoin price. A return to Thursday’s price level of $119,500 would place approximately $3.07 billion worth of short positions at risk of liquidation, indicating the potential for further volatility as bulls and bears battle for control.

2025-07-25T12:01:07,"Ripple Price Analysis: Is This XRP’s Calm Before the Next Crash?","Ripple’s native token has cooled off following its recent push higher, and both XRP/USDT and XRP/BTC charts suggest this pullback may still have room to develop further. While the broader structure remains bullish, price action is consolidating just below key resistance levels, hinting at a possible short-term reset before resuming its uptrend. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The USDT Pair On the XRP/USDT daily chart, the price has rejected the $3.50 horizontal resistance zone and is now finding support inside the $3.00 demand zone. This area also overlaps with the upper boundary of the previous consolidation range. The RSI has also sharply cooled down from overbought levels, now sitting around 59, giving the bulls some breathing room. However, unless buyers defend this area convincingly, there’s a risk of further pullback toward the $2.50 region, where the 100-day and 200-day moving averages are located. The BTC Pair The XRP/BTC pair, meanwhile, has broken down from its recent short-term uptrend and is now retracing into the fair value gap around 2,680 SAT. This drop follows a failure to push through the heavy resistance zone at 3,200 SAT. While the structure remains intact for now, the price is hovering inside the FVG and just above the 200-day moving average, making this a key zone for potential reaction. A loss of this level would open the door for a deeper retest of the 2,400 SAT region, while holding it could pave the way for a new attempt toward 3,200 SAT.

At that time, every on-chain metric pointed down. The bull score hit multi-year lows. BBMC indicators and the MVRV ratio flashed red warnings. Whale liquidations piled up, and many saw a bear market beginning. Market Indicators Flash Early Warnings Support levels stood strong after an April retest. Those same bears had to eat their words when Bitcoin bounced back. By May, prices broke past the January high and surged to $112,000. This month, BTC even hit $123,000 before taking a breather. That quick turnaround forced Young Ju to admit he was wrong—and to thank investors for showing him the mistake. He now says the old cycle theory no longer applies, since institutional players don’t follow the same playbook as retail buyers. Public companies like MicroStrategy (now Strategy) and other treasury-focused firms have become major holders. They treat Bitcoin as a reserve asset.

2025-07-25T12:00:00,"Upexi: The Market Loves Crypto Treasury Companies","Summary Upexi is the ""Solana Treasury Company,"" a line it has recently adopted after growing out of its e-commerce phase. While it is still operational, its primary business is now crypto-focused. The market seems to adore companies like this, and Upexi has jumped over 180% since the announcement, but it is still relatively fairly valued to its net assets. This could be a great opportunity for investors bullish on Solana, but this firm is on the frontier of risky companies, and investors should tread carefully. Thankfully, options trading went live recently for Upexi, offering investors a chance to buy a protective put! Introduction As someone who considers themselves a risk manager more than an investor (the difference makes me happy even if you think there isn't one), nothing makes me balk quite like the phrase, ""crypto treasury company."" Of course, when I see an opportunity to cover one of these companies, I want to take it — what if I'm wrong, and I discover a diamond in the rough? Enter Upexi Inc. ( UPXI ), which has had a very wild ride through the stock market, several iterations, massive spikes, and massive crashes. Now, they are a crypto treasury company. Data by YCharts That chart looks bad, but it's a remnant of the company's past as a hemp-CBD distributor — known as Grow Inc. at the time — then as an e-commerce brand owner for health and wellness products. Entering their Crypto Phase Let's zoom in to just their ""crypto phase,"" which started in April of this year. See when the announcement happened? It was a crazy spike, and that got the attention of a lot of investors who had never heard of this company before, or who remember it as a very different business. Data by YCharts The announcement in question was this : [UPXI] today announced establishing a digital currency holding company to invest and capitalize on the opportunities of cryptocurrency including Bitcoin and other coins with high growth potential. Upexi has made an initial investment in Bitcoin and is actively pursuing additional investment opportunities to expand its portfolio through further direct investment into coins, mining, and M&A in the fintech space. Management...have agreed to make a strategic investment in a portfolio of Cryptocurrency including Bitcoin that could grow exponentially in the future, and shift its growth strategy to opportunities in Crypto and the Blockchain. The Company has initiated a multi-pronged go-to-market strategy with a primary portfolio investment anchored by at least a 50% of the total portfolio asset size in Bitcoin and the remainder of the portfolio in cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ripple, Aave, Chainlink, Render, and several others. In the future, the portfolio will be available to view on the Upexi website with daily updates of Upexi's holdings. Upexi will initially operate through two newly established, wholly owned subsidiaries to separate our investments and reporting. The two entities consist of: ChainBitMiner: A diversified portfolio of Crypto coins anchored with 50-70% of portfolio in Bitcoin held in lieu of cash on balance sheet. The company will issue periodic press releases around completed Bitcoin purchases and newly added coins to the portfolio. QuantumHash: The Company will look to capitalize with investments in Crypto mining with a main focus on Bitcoin mining. The Company does not initially plan to operate its own mining operations. Andrew Norstrud, Chief Financial Officer of Upexi, stated, ""The strategy of using debt, equity and cash flow to accumulate Bitcoin has proven very successful for many companies and their investors. We believe an expanded strategy should give investors more exposure to new coins with more potential upside while anchoring our strategy with Bitcoin. The new Trump administration has been publicly bullish and with the possibility of large financial institutions beginning to adopt this financial asset alternative, it has been clearly evident now is the time to make a strategic investment into the space."" So, we see the beginnings of a few things: A Strategy ( MSTR ) style treasury, although with more than just Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). A foray into mining through investments in other mining ventures, not their own mining operations. They have already signed a LOI to acquire a mining facility. The other half of the crypto portfolio to be put in ""alt-coins,"" or non-Bitcoin crypto assets. On the mining side, Norstrud has said : We’re not aiming to be a pure-play mining operation...We’ll mine the best-performing coins, including AI-powered blockchain assets, with the goal of building a long-term crypto portfolio. Few things make me more nervous than the phrase, ""AI-powered blockchain assets."" That just screams risk and bubble behavior — but I don't decide what makes money in this market, and the market seems to love crypto treasury companies. Shortly after these announcements, UPXI deployed $100M in private placement funds into Solana ( SOL-USD ), which they are now ""staking,"" or collecting interest (more or less) by providing the tokens to help stabilize and secure the network. In this way, tokens that allow staking (Bitcoin does not natively support this on its blockchain) can be turned into cash-flowing assets. While the initial announcement didn't include any mention of SOL, the company is now calling themselves the ""Solana Treasury Company."" Here's some of the related marketing they've released on it: Upexi Upexi Don't Look At The Money, Think About the Future Because staking SOL provides a yield, and the other business operations of selling mushroom based wellness products, products for pets, and others on Amazon ( AMZN ) and elsewhere, the company does make some money. That revenue is entirely eaten up by expenses, and the net income is negative. Data by YCharts That may not matter to some, but it definitely does to others. Any cash they do raise (because they aren't making any) is being deployed into crypto projects in general, and SOL in particular. Data by YCharts Without much cash on hand, how are they buying all this Solana? Private placement into shares and debt issuance. The plan is for SOL to increase in value faster than management can devalue the stock through share and debt issuance. Data by YCharts One of the ways they are deploying their cash is to be ""locked"" SOL tokens, which come at a discount. We can see how they are habitually buying below market price, which they advertise as instant shareholder gains. This is true, in a sense, but it also relies on the price of SOL continuing to climb over time. Upexi While the firm was much more highly valued a month ago, now down 33% from then, it is now very closely aligned in market cap to its net asset value. Upexi This could present a good ""floor,"" provided one is bullish on Solana. Crypto can fall precipitously, and often without warning or much of a reason (it can go up the same way too), and so betting on something so fickle is not exactly akin to gambling, but can feel like it while one watches the price swings. Conclusion Ultimately, Upexi, Inc. ((UPXI)) is one of the newest ""crypto treasury companies,"" a firm that uses the cash from its (unrelated) operations and fundraising to buy cryptocurrencies. Specifically, UPXI has gone in on Solana ((SOL-USD)), calling itself the ""Solana Treasury Company."" This has paid off for them, and the company stands at tremendous gains since it made the switch. The current market loves this kind of stuff, and seemingly any company pushing into this space has been rewarded. Holding crypto instead of cash, UPXI hopes to make it big. As small as they are currently, it wouldn't take too much to grow. However, it also makes the firm extra risky, and if the floor falls out for crypto, it's unclear how long they will be able to hang on. Consider this firm extra speculative, and only for folks trying to take big swings with small amounts of capital. I won't call UPXI a lottery ticket, but I can see how the comparison fits. However, I don't decide what makes money in modern markets. Despite all the talk I've done about risk and bubble behavior (""AI-powered blockchain assets"" is a real doozy on this front), the company is up over 180% since the original announcement, and peaked at over 500% gains at one point. There were many shareholders that were rewarded by this firm, and they could continue to be indefinitely. Or it could go to zero. One bright note to leave off on: options trading began in early June. While it is relatively illiquid, options do allow for more prudent risk management. This is a stock I'd buy a protective put on just in case.
