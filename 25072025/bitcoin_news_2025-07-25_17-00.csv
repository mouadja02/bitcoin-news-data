2025-07-25T14:50:10,"Strategy's Stretch (STRC) preferred stock hits markets at $90 pricing","Strategy announced the upcoming placement of its Stretch (STRC) preferred shares. The offer will be priced at $90, expected to close on July 29. Strategy (MSTR) announced the extension of its preferred share program. Stretch (STRC) will be priced at $90, with the sale round expected to close on July 29. The price is at the bottom of the range where the firm intended to sell at a face value of $100. The placement announcement adds to the final features of STRC after the initial announcement. Strategy is preparing to place 28,011,111 shares at a public offering price of $90 per share. The company expects to raise $2.474B after commissions and fees. The higher amount of shares were announced after the STRC product was oversubscribed. The final offer surpasses even the corrected raise of $2B announced earlier this week. As with other preferred stock offerings, the proceeds of STRC will go toward acquiring more BTC and for the company’s working capital. At the current sale rate, STRC may help add between 17,000 and 21,000 BTC, depending on the market price. The raise is higher than the initially announced $500M , potentially showing heightened interest for new types of Strategy assets. The sale of STRC arrives after Strategy announced two weekly rounds of BTC acquisition financed solely with preferred shares. While the preferred shares may be riskier, this also prevents further dilution from MSTR issues. STRC to offer cumulative dividends STRC will accumulate dividends at a variable rate, and dividends will be payable when authorized by Strategy’s board. The initial monthly regular dividend will be at 9% annualized, but the rate may be adjusted at Strategy’s discretion. STRC issuance will be variable, aiming to maintain a $100 peg. To achieve this, Strategy will adjust the dividend rate, issue more STRC at $101, recall shares, or turn off the sale program under $99. STRC will be one of the most responsive products for Strategy, immediately reflecting demand and market conditions. The new instrument is issued as shares, but behaves like a passive income bond. During favorable times, Strategy can force a repurchase of STRC. During unfavorable BTC price periods, holders can sell back their shares at face value. The STRC dividend rate can be adjusted monthly, but by no more than 0.25% up or down. STRC is thus an instrument to pump cash into BTC, while behaving like a short-term fixed income instrument. The potential for yield and stability may make STRC appealing to mainstream retail investors. The STRC dividends will be paid out in cash, another feature that emulates short-term bonds. MSTR holds above $400 Despite the recent slide in BTC, MSTR shares still traded above $406. STRK preferred shares hovered around 111, STRF traded at $112, and STRD was at $0.87. The preferred shares gained support from a series of private placements, as well as general demand. STRC is not backed by the underlying BTC, which is reserved for only some of Strategy’s investors. Despite the instrument, Strategy’s approach works only if its market activities cause hype and more upside for BTC. The new STRC shares will be senior to STRK and STRD, as well as MSTR common stock, but junior to STRF and convertible bonds from previous rounds. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

2025-07-25T14:46:07,"YBIT: ~46% Distribution Yield, But Peer Looks Better","Summary YBIT offers high income via call writing on Bitcoin exposure, but the usual caveat exists with capped upside potential if Bitcoin rallies strongly. We covered BTCI recently, and we made several comparisons between the two, where BTCI looks like the stronger fund. YBIT's monthly distributions are attractive for income-focused investors, but they can be quite volatile, similar to the underlying asset. Written by Nick Ackerman, co-produced by Stanford Chemist We recently covered the NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF ( BTCI ), which gives investors a fairly straightforward strategy of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) exposure while also writing call options to generate 'high income.' However, that isn't the only ETF in the space, and another one of the competitors out there is the YieldMax Bitcoin Option Income Strategy ETF ( YBIT ) . This is a fund sponsor that focuses specifically on generating 'yield' for income-focused investors, as its name would suggest. Given our recent dive into BTCI, we'll be making many comparisons between the two funds. YBIT Basics Dividend Frequency: Monthly Dividend Yield: 1.54% SEC yield, 45.72% Distribution Yield Expense Ratio: 0.99% Leverage: N/A Managed Assets: $152.63 million Structure: Active ETF YBIT's investment objective is ""to seek current income."" They also have the secondary investment objective to ""seek exposure to the share price of the Bitcoin ETPs, subject to a limit on potential investment gains."" The fund will seek to achieve this through ""a synthetic covered call strategy on one or more select U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETPs."" YBIT's Portfolio YBIT is fairly straightforward and quite similar to BTCI, which we covered previously. They provide exposure to BTC primarily through another ETF. For BTCI, they hold a sizeable stake in VanEck Bitcoin ETF ( HODL ), but they also have synthetic exposure through purchasing call options and selling put options. YBIT is long the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) with a sizeable stake, and then the written call contracts. Further, both also have other cash and cash-equivalent positions through U.S. Treasuries. Within their prospectus , the fund also states that the fund can use a synthetic covered call strategy. 1. Synthetic Long Exposure To achieve a synthetic long exposure to each Underlying ETP, the Fund will buy call options on each Underlying ETP and, simultaneously, sell put options on each Underlying ETP to try to replicate the price movements of the Underlying ETP. The call options purchased by the Fund and the put options sold by the Fund will generally have one-month to one-year terms and strike prices that are approximately equal to the then-current share price of their corresponding Underlying ETP at the time the contracts are purchased and sold, respectively. The combination of the long call options and sold put options provides the Fund with investment exposure equal to approximately 100% of their corresponding Underlying ETP for the duration of the applicable options exposure. In addition to employing its synthetic options strategies described above, the Fund may achieve similar indirect exposure to each Underlying ETP by purchasing deep in-the-money ((ITM)) call options. Deep ITM call options have strike prices significantly below the current share price of the corresponding Underlying ETP, allowing the Fund to replicate the price movements of the Underlying ETP with minimal intrinsic value risk. The deep ITM call option approach may serve as an alternative to the synthetic long strategy or may be used in conjunction with it, depending on market conditions and the Adviser’s discretion. However, the latest holdings don't reflect that they are employing the strategy through an options approach, but simply through IBIT. YBIT Holdings (YieldMax) When looking at YBIT, the expense ratio for the fund is 0.99%. Since more than half of the underlying portfolio is another ETF, considering the IBIT expense ratio can be important too, which comes in at 0.25%. For some context, BTCI's expense ratio comes to 0.98% with HODL's expense ratio being waived through January 10, 2026. However, there is some fine print; if the ETF garners over $2.5 billion AUM before that date, the fund will see assets above that level charged 0.20%. Post that waiver date, all assets will see a 0.20% expense ratio. With that said, it would favor BTCI currently on the expense front. In addition, that is particularly true because HODL comes to around 25% of BTCI's exposure. So that is something to consider if trying to decide between the two. High 'Yield' From Options The written option contracts will help to generate the 'income' via the collection of option premiums. Since BTC is quite volatile, the underlying options on the CBOE Mini Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index (MBTX) comes with relatively high implied volatility—at least when compared to something like the broader equity market as measured by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ). When we looked at BTCI, it was around double. At the time of writing this, it is even higher by a significant margin, with implied volatility at around 37% for MBTX at the $290 strike, which we see listed in YBIT's holdings above. That can be compared to ~11% for SPY on the first few strikes above the current ~$623 trading level. MBTX Option Chain (Fidelity) That's how you can end up with distribution rates that are well into the double-digits. YBIT Distribution Yield (YieldMax) For those curious, the 30-Day SEC Yield is the result of the U.S. Treasury holdings minus the expense ratio. So there are some small amounts of interest payments being generated within the portfolio that would also be paid out to investors. It's just very small and quite insignificant when looking at the overall ~46% distribution rate. The fund also pays monthly, but just as fluctuating as the underlying asset is impacting the implied volatility, its payout can equally be as volatile. The monthly pay certainly means that investors don't have to wait too long between payments, though. YBIT Distribution History (Seeking Alpha) While the option writing generates the attractive distribution yield that investors are looking for, it also comes with a downside. For investors who are familiar with call writing funds, they know that upside can be capped. This is because, for example, if MBTX rises rapidly above the $290 strike price, YBIT's gains are capped at that level. The breakeven would be $290 plus the premium received, though the premium is paid out to investors in this case, meaning the NAV/share price is adjusted for that. In looking at BTCI previously, we already know that gains have been capped relative to its ETF holding, HODL, which offers straight exposure to BTC. Now, we can compare YBIT, BTCI, HODL and IBIT—which we can see that YBIT is underperforming by a significant margin relative to BTCI. YCharts Data by YCharts We would assume that it would underperform HODL and IBIT, because we know that BTC has been blasting higher at a rapid clip. That's why we see BTCI underperform as well. Still, the sheer difference between YBIT and BTCI is a bit shocking, at least initially. This is certainly more than just the higher expense ratio we see for YBIT. In this case, it appears that YBIT ends up giving up further upside by being overwritten through covered calls relative to BTCI. BTCI uses synthetic long positioning, and while YBIT has it stated in their prospectus that they can as well, they don't appear to be utilizing that strategy. At least, if they are, it appears that they aren't doing so as effectively. For example, coming out of the April decline and into a strong May, it is quite likely that they started overwriting the portfolio to a lesser degree to participate in the upside recovery. I don't follow this fund every day, watching every single holding they have, that's why management gets paid their advisory fee; however, simply looking at the chart suggests that's a pretty good educated guess of what occurred. With that said, one of the reasons I would still prefer to hold some exposure to something like BTCI (and I own ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ), which is a different approach) is that they pay distributions. Every distribution received is a 'guaranteed' return in the fact that those cash distributions can't be pulled back. At least, if one doesn't reinvest it back into the fund or elsewhere. When holding funds like HODL or IBIT, or even BTC itself, you're at the whims of the daily market fluctuations in terms of your returns. Conclusion YBIT is another offering in the Bitcoin space that looks to generate a yield from writing call options. This would be thanks to high implied volatility, which leads to some truly massive distribution rates that can be generated from the strategy. However, it can also cap upside if BTC continues to rise at a rapid pace. For YBIT, that does appear to have been an issue relative to BTCI. BTCI still saw its upside capped relative to straight vanilla BTC ETFs, as expected, but to a meaningfully lesser degree. Past performance does not guarantee future results, but at least for this relatively short tracking period, the win would go to the NEOS team.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4804479-ybit-46-percent-distribution-yield-but-peer-looks-better?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION","BTCI|BTC-USD|HODL|IBIT|ITM|SPY|BITO|IBIT:CA|YBIT",cryptocompare
2025-07-25T14:45:09,"The Reason for Bitcoin's Decline Revealed! A Giant Company Launches a Billion-Dollar Night Operation!","Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) has been declining following increased selling pressure following its ATH of $123,000 in recent weeks. At this point, while BTC fell to the level of 115 thousand dollars, it was stated that Galaxy Digital's BTC transfer, which reached a total of 3.5 billion dollars, was behind this decline. According to data from Lookonchain, Galaxy Digital transferred 30,000 BTC worth approximately $3.5 billion today. Lookonchain noted that the company sent most of these BTC directly to exchanges and sold them. Update: #GalaxyDigital has transferred nearly 30,000 $BTC ($3.5B) out today, most of which went directly to exchanges and were sold.

Bitcoin experienced its steepest decline in recent days, falling from $118,000 to $115,000 overnight. While Galaxy Digital's sales were influential in Bitcoin's decline, these transactions attracted attention because they occurred immediately after the company recently acquired 80,000 BTC from a wallet dating back to the Satoshi era that had been dormant for 14 years. While Galaxy Digital’s BTC transfers further fueled fears of selling pressure, it was stated that Galaxy Digital still holds 18,504 BTC worth $2.14 billion.

Crypto Week activity failed to sustain retail or institutional momentum. Stablecoin frameworks like the GENIUS Act could influence Treasury demand and impact digital asset positioning. Bitcoin’s recent rally appears to be losing momentum, with Matrixport projecting a period of consolidation through August after “Crypto Week.” In a July 25 report shared on social media, Matrixport said Bitcoin had reached a technical ceiling at $122,000, following a breakout earlier in the month that lacked sustained leverage support. Anticlimatic Market Post Crypto Week Although retail activity increased during the U.S. “Crypto Week,” analysts observed limited follow-through. #MatrixOnTarget Report – July 25, 2025 Bitcoin Hits Seasonal Brake: Time to Rotate or Reload? #Matrixport #Bitcoin #BTC #CryptoMarket #GENIUSAct #MarketConsolidation #InstitutionalAdoption #ETH #OnChainData #FedWatch #MacroOutlook #RiskSentiment pic.twitter.com/KGwLGc7O2K — Matrixport Official (@Matrixport_EN) July 25, 2025 The firm described the move as “poised to cool” in its prior July 18 note, which preceded a weekly decline of 0.6%. Open interest in Ethereum futures rose sharply from $14 billion to $25 billion, though funding rates remained relatively stable. Matrixport expects these rates to reprice lower over the coming weeks, prompting position unwinding. The report also cited rising profit-taking pressure from early holders and a shift toward risk reduction as the market enters a slower summer cycle. Matrixport noted that confidence among long-position holders now hinges on continued upward price action. Without it, leveraged trades may be unwound, especially in the face of higher carry costs. Industry Enters “Quieter Summer” The White House’s anticipated Bitcoin reserve strategy report has been delayed to July 30, missing the original 180-day deadline of July 22. Matrixport does not expect substantive new policy direction from the document, suggesting attention has shifted to the GENIUS Act , which focuses on stablecoin-backed Treasury demand. “As we enter the quieter summer period and approach the seasonal recess, we anticipate an increase in position squaring (unwinding),” the report stated. “With the end of U.S. Crypto Week marking a peak in market momentum.” The firm sees the current market phase as technically overbought and expects limited upside without fresh catalysts. Rising market complexity is also driving increased use of technical overlays and macro signals in digital asset trading strategies. Positioning decisions are becoming more sensitive to broader monetary dynamics, including real yields, funding spreads, and cross-asset correlations. With instruments like the GENIUS Act linking stablecoin issuance to U.S. Treasuries, short-term rate expectations may play a larger role in shaping digital asset flows going forward. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What are real yields, and why do they matter to crypto markets now? Real yields—adjusted for inflation—affect risk appetite and capital flows. Investors are factoring real yield changes into positioning decisions. What does a rise in open interest without rising funding rates imply? It may signal muted bullish conviction. If leverage builds but traders aren’t paying higher funding costs, it suggests hedging or indecision, rather than directional confidence. Why is position squaring a concern during the summer cycle? Summer trading often sees reduced volume and thinner liquidity. Without catalysts, large open positions may be unwound to manage exposure, contributing to sideways or downward price pressure.

2025-07-25T14:40:43,"ETH Steals the Spotlight, BNB Taps New Record, BTC Cools Off: Your Weekly Crypto Recap","Another volatile and eventful week passed by in the cryptocurrency markets, but the overall sentiment is that the winds are changing as altcoins have emerged in the spotlight. This is mostly because bitcoin has started to lose traction. Recall that the primary cryptocurrency skyrocketed to a new all-time high at the beginning of last week when it briefly exceeded $123,000. While that was spectacular on its own, it didn’t last long, and the asset retraced almost immediately by seven grand. What followed for the next ten days or so was sideways trading. BTC remained confined in a relatively tight range between $117,000 and $120,000 as each attempt for a breakout was met with a forceful rejection. The most violent one took place in the past day. Following reports that Galaxy Digital has started to dispose of its assets by offloading $1.5 billion worth of BTC, the cryptocurrency’s price tumbled and slipped below $115,000 for the first time in two weeks. Although it has recovered some ground, it’s still struggling to reclaim $116,000 as of press time, and it’s down by over 2.5% on a weekly scale. At the same time, many altcoins, such as LTC, ENA, and CRO, have produced mindblowing gains within the same timeframe. Binance Coin, on the other hand, shot up to a fresh ATH at over $800 before retracing slightly. Ethereum is also in the green since this time last week. Perhaps driven by the substantial inflows in the spot Ethereum ETFs, the largest altcoin blasted to $3,850 earlier this week. It has lost some ground, but it’s still 1.2% up weekly and now sits close to $3,700. Some of the altseason speculations that ran rampant for the past week or so came to a halt due to violent corrections from assets like XRP, XLM, HBAR, PEPE, and AAVE, all of which have plunged by double-digits since last Friday.

As mentioned above, the Ethereum ETFs have enjoyed the past few weeks, attracting billions of dollars in net inflows. As usual, BlackRock’s ETHA has stood out the most as it became the 3rd-fastest fund to reach the $10 billion AUM milestone within its initial year. XRP Longs Crushed on Binance as Analyst Flags Ripple Co-Founder’s $140M Sell-Off . Ripple’s native token was among the top performers lately, but its price suddenly crashed from over $3.4 to $3 within 48 hours. At first, the community blamed it on a speculative move by Upbit, but further reports suggested that one of the company’s co-founders might have sold $140 million worth of XRP. Robert Kiyosaki Recommends Owning Real BTC, Not ‘Paper’ ETFs . The now-permanent bitcoin proponent, Kiyosaki, believes people should aim to distinguish themselves from the ‘regular investor’ stereotype. As such, they need to focus on accumulating real bitcoin, gold, and silver, instead of opting for ETFs. Hash Ribbons Signal Ends – Here’s What It Could Mean for Bitcoin’s Next Move . As it appears that BTC’s consolidation may have come to an end, one indicator suggests the asset’s future price performance. The now-completed Hash Ribbons signal indicates that miners may have finished their capitulation phase, which is typically good news for bitcoin’s price. Retail or Whales?

2025-07-25T14:40:10,"Corporate Bitcoin Adoption: Volcon’s Astonishing $375 Million Bet Signals a New Era","BitcoinWorld Corporate Bitcoin Adoption: Volcon’s Astonishing $375 Million Bet Signals a New Era In a move that has sent ripples across both the traditional financial markets and the burgeoning cryptocurrency world, Volcon, a Nasdaq-listed all-electric power sports company, has significantly ramped up its digital asset portfolio. This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a profound statement on the growing trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption , signaling a deepening institutional embrace of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. For many, this development underscores Bitcoin’s evolving role from a speculative asset to a legitimate treasury reserve. Volcon’s Astonishing Leap into Bitcoin Holdings The news broke with considerable excitement: Volcon announced a substantial purchase of 2,903 Bitcoin (BTC), dramatically increasing its total holdings to an impressive 3,183 BTC. According to reports from prominent crypto observers like @btcNLNico on X, these holdings are now valued at approximately $375 million. This isn’t merely an investment; it’s a strategic pivot that positions Volcon among a growing cohort of publicly traded companies diversifying their balance sheets with digital gold. For a company primarily known for its innovative electric motorcycles and off-road vehicles, this move into the volatile realm of cryptocurrency might seem unexpected to some. However, it aligns with a broader macroeconomic narrative that has seen corporations explore alternative asset classes to hedge against inflation, seek growth opportunities, and appeal to a new generation of tech-savvy investors. Volcon’s decision to accumulate such a significant amount of Bitcoin is a testament to the increasing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its potential as a store of value. Why Are Companies Embracing Corporate Bitcoin Adoption? The question on many minds is, why are more and more corporations, like Volcon, choosing to allocate significant capital to Bitcoin? The reasons are multifaceted, blending macroeconomic trends with a forward-looking vision of financial strategy. Here are some key drivers behind the surge in corporate Bitcoin adoption : Inflation Hedge: In an era of unprecedented quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, traditional fiat currencies are experiencing a decline in purchasing power. Bitcoin, with its capped supply of 21 million coins, is seen by many as a superior inflation hedge, akin to digital gold. Diversification of Treasury Reserves: Companies are looking beyond traditional cash and bond holdings to diversify their treasury reserves. Bitcoin offers a non-correlated asset that can potentially enhance overall portfolio returns and reduce reliance on volatile fiat currencies. Growth Opportunity: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically outperformed most traditional assets over the long term. Companies view Bitcoin as a high-growth asset that can significantly appreciate in value, boosting their balance sheets and shareholder value. Technological Innovation and Future-Proofing: Investing in Bitcoin aligns companies with the cutting edge of financial technology. It signals an embrace of innovation and a readiness to participate in the evolving digital economy, potentially attracting tech-focused talent and investors. Investor Appeal: For many investors, particularly younger demographics, a company’s embrace of Bitcoin can be a significant draw. It demonstrates a progressive mindset and an understanding of emerging asset classes, potentially increasing stock appeal and valuation. The MicroStrategy Blueprint: Paving the Way for Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Volcon’s move is not an isolated incident but rather a continuation of a trend largely pioneered by MicroStrategy, led by its outspoken CEO Michael Saylor. MicroStrategy began acquiring Bitcoin in August 2020, and its aggressive accumulation strategy has since made it the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin globally. Their strategy was rooted in the belief that Bitcoin is a superior asset for treasury reserves compared to cash, which was losing value due to inflation. MicroStrategy’s bold bet has served as a powerful case study for other companies contemplating corporate Bitcoin adoption . Their success, despite market fluctuations, has demonstrated that it’s possible for a public company to successfully integrate Bitcoin into its financial strategy. While not every company will adopt the same aggressive stance, MicroStrategy’s blueprint has undoubtedly normalized the idea of holding Bitcoin on corporate balance sheets, providing a framework for others to follow. Here’s a quick comparison of the motivations driving MicroStrategy and now Volcon: Aspect MicroStrategy’s Approach Volcon’s Approach (Apparent) Primary Goal Long-term hedge against inflation; maximize shareholder value through Bitcoin appreciation. Balance sheet diversification; potential growth asset; aligning with future tech trends. Scale of Holdings Massive, continuous accumulation; largest corporate holder. Significant, but potentially more conservative than MicroStrategy’s initial pace. Public Stance Highly vocal and evangelistic about Bitcoin. Strategic financial decision, less about public advocacy for Bitcoin. Industry Business Intelligence Software Electric Power Sports Vehicles Benefits and Opportunities of Holding Bitcoin on the Balance Sheet For companies like Volcon, the benefits of embracing corporate Bitcoin adoption extend beyond mere financial speculation. The strategic advantages can be substantial, offering new avenues for growth and stability: Enhanced Balance Sheet Strength: If Bitcoin’s value appreciates, it directly boosts the company’s assets, improving its financial standing and perceived value. Attracting New Investor Demographics: Companies holding Bitcoin often appeal to a new class of investors who are enthusiastic about digital assets and the future of finance. This can broaden the investor base and potentially increase stock demand. Competitive Edge: Being an early mover or a significant holder in the corporate Bitcoin space can differentiate a company from its competitors, positioning it as innovative and forward-thinking. Potential for Future Integration: Holding Bitcoin might open doors for future business models, such as accepting Bitcoin for payments, integrating blockchain technology into operations, or participating in decentralized finance (DeFi). Navigating the Challenges and Risks of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption While the allure of Bitcoin is strong, it’s crucial for companies to approach corporate Bitcoin adoption with a clear understanding of the inherent challenges and risks. Bitcoin’s volatility is well-documented, and its price can fluctuate wildly in short periods. This volatility can lead to significant unrealized losses on a company’s balance sheet, which might impact quarterly earnings reports and investor sentiment. Furthermore, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations regarding taxation, custody, or trading could impact the value and accessibility of corporate Bitcoin holdings. Companies must also consider the technical complexities of secure Bitcoin custody, requiring robust security measures to protect against hacks or loss of private keys. Another challenge lies in accounting treatment. Bitcoin is often treated as an intangible asset for accounting purposes, which means companies must report impairment charges if its value drops below the acquisition cost, even if the loss is only on paper and the asset is not sold. This can create accounting complexities and potentially mislead investors about the company’s operational performance. What Does Volcon’s Move Mean for the Broader Market? Volcon’s substantial corporate Bitcoin adoption is more than just a company making an investment; it’s a signal. It suggests that the trend of companies holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset is gaining momentum beyond just tech-centric firms. As more diverse companies, like those in manufacturing or power sports, allocate capital to Bitcoin, it lends further legitimacy to the asset class. This increased institutional demand can contribute to Bitcoin’s price stability in the long run, as large corporate holdings are typically less susceptible to short-term trading whims. It also highlights a growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate part of the global financial system, potentially paving the way for broader retail and institutional adoption. Actionable Insights for Investors and Companies For investors, Volcon’s move highlights the importance of researching companies that are strategically positioning themselves within the digital asset space. Understanding a company’s treasury strategy, particularly its stance on Bitcoin, can offer insights into its long-term vision and risk appetite. For companies considering corporate Bitcoin adoption , it’s crucial to: Conduct Thorough Due Diligence: Understand Bitcoin’s mechanics, market dynamics, and associated risks. Develop a Clear Strategy: Define the purpose of holding Bitcoin (e.g., inflation hedge, growth asset) and establish clear parameters for acquisition and management. Ensure Robust Security: Implement top-tier custody solutions and security protocols to protect digital assets. Consult Legal and Accounting Experts: Navigate the complex regulatory and accounting implications of holding cryptocurrencies. Conclusion: A New Chapter in Corporate Finance Volcon’s significant acquisition of Bitcoin marks another pivotal moment in the ongoing narrative of corporate Bitcoin adoption . It underscores a growing conviction among forward-thinking companies that Bitcoin is not just a passing fad but a foundational asset for the future. As the digital economy continues to evolve, the strategic inclusion of cryptocurrencies on corporate balance sheets may well become a standard practice, reshaping how businesses manage their wealth and engage with the global financial landscape. Volcon’s bold move serves as a compelling reminder that the future of finance is increasingly digital, decentralized, and undeniably exciting. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is corporate Bitcoin adoption? Corporate Bitcoin adoption refers to publicly traded or private companies acquiring and holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset on their balance sheets, rather than just holding traditional fiat currency or other conventional investments. This strategy is often driven by a desire to hedge against inflation, diversify assets, or capitalize on Bitcoin’s growth potential. 2. Why did Volcon purchase such a large amount of Bitcoin? Volcon’s decision to purchase 2,903 BTC, bringing its total to 3,183 BTC, likely stems from a strategic financial move to diversify its treasury reserves, potentially hedge against inflation, and align its balance sheet with the growing digital asset economy. It reflects a belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value and its role as a store of value. 3. How does Volcon’s Bitcoin acquisition compare to MicroStrategy’s strategy? While Volcon’s acquisition is substantial, MicroStrategy pioneered the aggressive corporate Bitcoin adoption strategy, accumulating a significantly larger amount of Bitcoin and making it a central part of its corporate identity. Volcon’s move suggests a similar belief in Bitcoin’s value, but its overall scale and public messaging may differ from MicroStrategy’s more evangelistic approach. 4. What are the risks associated with companies holding Bitcoin? The primary risks include Bitcoin’s high price volatility, which can lead to significant unrealized losses on a company’s balance sheet. Other risks involve evolving regulatory landscapes, the complexities of secure digital asset custody, and specific accounting treatments that can impact financial reporting. 5. Will more companies follow Volcon’s example of corporate Bitcoin adoption? It’s highly probable. As Bitcoin gains more mainstream acceptance and its infrastructure matures, more companies are likely to explore corporate Bitcoin adoption. The success stories of early adopters like MicroStrategy and now Volcon could encourage other businesses to consider integrating Bitcoin into their treasury strategies, especially as they seek innovative ways to manage capital in a changing global economy.

In a new interview with CNBC, Ritholtz Wealth Management CEO Josh Brown notes that Cboe thrives on high trading volumes and volatility. Brown says the company’s stock is rising because traders are trading options “to an extent that we have never seen before.” “Cboe is a fantastic company, and this is one of the best charts in the market, and this is now one of the best stocks in the market. They have earnings on August 1st, there could be a little bit of a blip, so if you’re looking for an entry and they put out a report and it’s a sell-the-news reaction, and this name comes in a couple of bucks, that’s probably the entry that I would look for as far as risk management.” CBOE is trading at $246 at time of writing and is up more than 2% in the past 24 hours and more than 3% in the past week. The stock hit an all-time high of $247 this week. The CEO also notes his other top stocks right now include the retail trading giant Robinhood (HOOD) and the online brokerage Interactive Brokers LLC (IBKR). “Trading is hot. It’s what people are doing. Institutions and retail. Some are hedging, some are speculating, doesn’t matter, these companies are the gateway, and they’re all raking it in right now.” ?

Here Are the Details","UK-based web design firm The Smarter Web Company announced that it has increased its total Bitcoin holdings to 1,825 BTC by purchasing an additional 225 BTC as part of its digital transformation strategy, focusing on creating a Bitcoin treasury. British Web Design Company The Smarter Web Company Increases Its Bitcoin Holdings to 1,825 BTC The company's spend on this acquisition was approximately $26.4 million (£19.6 million). According to the company's statement today, the latest purchase was made at an average price of $118,076/BTC. The average cost of all BTC purchases was $109,088/BTC.

In its first half financial report for 2025, published on the same day, the company reported a loss of $968,640 (£719,566) as of April 30. The loss for the same period last year was $501,605. The company's CEO, Andrew Webley, said the following in his statement on the subject: “We believe that Bitcoin is the best asset the world has ever seen, alongside our core business. Therefore, we are investing the capital we hold for our future business needs in Bitcoin.” Webley also emphasized that the company went public on the London-based Aquis Stock Exchange on April 25, 2025, raising more than £100 million in equity capital in the process and having no debt.

Ethereum has rebounded from a recent drop to $3,507, showing buyer interest. Dropping to $3,300 will build upside liquidity for Ethereum and set up a bullish reversal. Ethereum faced resistance at $3,860 last Monday before sliding to $3,507 later in the week. Despite a partial recovery to $3,694, analyst Michael van de Poppe stated that the pullback may not be over, hinting at ongoing consolidation before the next decisive move. Update on $ETH .

2025-07-25T14:08:39,"Novogratz Predicts Ether May Outperform Bitcoin Amid Institutional Buying Frenzy","Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz believes Ether is on track to outperform Bitcoin within the next six months, driven by rapid institutional accumulation and a tightening supply. Speaking to CNBC on Thursday, Novogratz said , “There’s not a lot of supply of ETH, and so I think ETH probably has a chance to outperform Bitcoin in the next three to six months.” At the time of his remarks, Ether was trading around $3,618, and Novogratz pointed to the $4,000 mark as a key level for the asset. “We feel kind of destined to at least knock on the $4,000 ceiling a few times,” he said, noting that a breakout above this level would push Ether into “price discovery” mode, potentially opening the door for new all-time highs. Major Firms Fuel Ether Narrative Novogratz highlighted the “really powerful” narrative forming around Ether, driven by high-profile corporate buyers entering the market. BitMine Immersion Technologies disclosed on Thursday that it holds 566,776 ETH worth over $2.03 billion, while Sharplink Gaming reported 360,807 ETH worth approximately $1.29 billion. Additionally, Ether Machine, a new firm preparing to list on Nasdaq under the ticker “ETHM,” will launch with over 400,000 ETH valued at more than $1.5 billion under management. These developments reflect a broader institutional pivot toward ETH, with Novogratz noting, “They are raising capital every day and buying Ether.” His outlook aligns with BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, who predicted earlier this week that ETH could reach $10,000 by the end of the year if the momentum continues. On the technical front, ETH has shown strong relative performance against Bitcoin, with the ETH/BTC ratio up 36.53% over the past 30 days, according to TradingView data. Bitcoin Still Poised for Growth Despite Ether’s rising strength, Novogratz remains bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory . He indicated that a Bitcoin price of $150,000 is a “decent target,” emphasizing that as long as the current macro narrative holds, the crypto market appears “destined to go higher.” Bitfinex analysts also noted in a recent report that if Bitcoin’s uptrend persists, the next major target could be $136,000, though they cautioned it may align with overextended bullish sentiment and potential local tops. Novogratz acknowledged potential macro risks, cautioning that a reversal in US monetary policy could alter his outlook. “If Trump decides the country doesn’t need lower rates, that would change my thesis,” he said, “but until that happens, I think we’re heading to 150.” The post Novogratz Predicts Ether May Outperform Bitcoin Amid Institutional Buying Frenzy appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",thecoinrise,https://thecoinrise.com/novogratz-predicts-ether-may-outperform-bitcoin-amid-institutional-buying-frenzy/,"BTC|ETH|TRADING|MARKET|EXCHANGE","Market News|Ether price|Ethereum vs Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-07-25T14:00:13,"What You Would Have Now If You’d Bought XRP With Your $1,200 Stimulus Check In 2020","When the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020, the U.S. government responded with a series of stimulus checks to help Americans weather the financial storm. While most recipients used the funds to cover essential expenses, some saw a rare opportunity to invest in digital assets like XRP . Five years later, the returns on such a move would be nothing short of remarkable. A Look Back at the COVID-19 Stimulus Checks In March 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law, launching the first round of relief payments. Eligible individuals received up to $1,200, while married couples received $2,400, plus $500 per child under 17. By the end of that month, the U.S. government had issued nearly 162 million payments, distributing over $270 billion. A second round of payments was approved in December 2020 under the COVID-related Tax Relief Act. This time, individuals received up to $600, and married couples received $1,200. The benefit for children increased to $600 per dependent. These payments reached Americans through direct deposits, checks, and prepaid debit cards starting in late December. Though many used these funds to manage bills and everyday expenses, an investment in XRP during these periods would have yielded astonishing gains. The XRP Investment Scenario When the first stimulus checks were delivered in April 2020, XRP was priced around $0.18. Investing the full $1,200 would have bought you approximately 6,666 XRP tokens. By the time the second round of checks arrived in December 2020, XRP was trading at about $0.20. A $600 investment then would have added another 3,000 XRP to your holdings. In total, a combined investment of $1,800 across both rounds of stimulus payments would have secured you 9,666 XRP. Fast forward to today, July 2025, with XRP trading around $3.20, those tokens would now be worth roughly $31,000. That’s a staggering 1,622% return on investment, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 77%. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP vs. Bitcoin: Which Would Have Performed Better? To provide perspective, let’s compare XRP’s performance with Bitcoin (BTC) over the same timeframe. In April 2020, Bitcoin was priced at around $6,800. By December 2020, it had climbed to $26,000. If you had invested $1,200 and $600 in BTC during those two windows, you would have acquired roughly 0.1994 BTC. With Bitcoin now valued at approximately $118,000, your BTC investment would be worth about $23,538, impressive, but still lower than XRP’s $31,000. This comparison highlights how XRP outpaced even the largest and most established cryptocurrency over the past five years, at least from this investment angle. Timeless Wisdom From Investment Icons The idea of investing unexpected windfalls aligns with principles shared by legendary investors. Warren Buffett famously advised: “Do not save what is left after spending, but spend what is left after saving.” His philosophy underscores the importance of prioritizing long-term financial growth. Likewise, Bill Gross, co-founder of PIMCO, emphasized the value of having cash ready for the right opportunity. Strategic patience, coupled with preparedness, often separates average outcomes from extraordinary success. In hindsight, the COVID-19 stimulus checks provided a golden chance for such investment foresight, and XRP turned out to be one of the most lucrative paths. Final Thoughts This retrospective serves as a powerful reminder of how even modest investments, made at the right time, can lead to life-changing returns. While the future of crypto remains unpredictable, the XRP stimulus scenario shows the potential rewards of taking calculated risks and thinking ahead. In the world of investing, timing, preparation, and vision often make all the difference. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

He emphasizes the importance of self-custody and holding real assets. Institutional investors have committed over $54.66 billion to the Bitcoin market through ETFs. Robert Kiyosaki, renowned author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, has once again sounded the alarm on the limitations of paper-based investments. In a recent message to investors, he drew attention to Bitcoin ETFs and their role in financial planning.

That performance, while modest compared to their bitcoin counterparts, arrives alongside a surge in investor activity and price momentum. Over the past two weeks alone, the ETFs brought in more than $4.6 billion — nearly half of their total annual inflows — coinciding with a sharp uptick in ether’s ( ETH ) price. ETH gained 26% during the week of July 14, after rising 16% the week before, outpacing much of the broader market. It is now trading at $3,704, up 11% on the year. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) stood out among the pack by crossing $10 billion in assets under management this week. The milestone makes ETHA the third-fastest ETF in history to reach that figure, according to Bloomberg Intelligence’s Eric Balchunas . Only BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) got there faster. The spot Ethereum ETFs debuted just months after the blockbuster launch of spot bitcoin (BTC) funds, which attracted billions of dollars and renewed Wall Street’s interest in crypto-based products. The Ethereum lineup includes offerings from financial giants like Fidelity, VanEck, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, and others.
