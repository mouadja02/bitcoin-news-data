2025-07-25T04:39:26,"BitMine Snaps Up $2B in Ether in 16 Days, Leads New Wave of ETH Treasury Firms","BitMine Immersion Technologies has emerged as the largest corporate holder of Ether after acquiring more than $2 billion worth of ETH in just over two weeks, according to a statement released Thursday . Key Takeaways: BitMine has become the largest corporate holder of Ether, acquiring over $2 billion worth in just 16 days. The firm aims to stake 5% of the total Ether supply, a target worth around $22 billion. Corporate Ether treasuries are rising rapidly, with BitMine and SharpLink leading a new wave of accumulation. The Bitcoin mining company announced it had purchased 566,776 Ether over a 16-day span, amounting to approximately $2.03 billion at current prices. The aggressive move has vaulted BitMine ahead of rivals in the fast-growing race to build strategic Ether treasuries. BitMine Aims to Stake 5% of Total Ether Supply, Says Chairman Tom Lee Tom Lee, managing partner at FundStrat and chairman of BitMine, said the firm is targeting an ambitious goal ‚Äî to acquire and stake 5% of the total Ether supply. At today‚Äôs estimates, that would amount to roughly six million ETH, or about $22 billion. Ether‚Äôs supply is elastic due to its burn mechanism, making this a moving target. If successful, BitMine would control a larger share of Ether than MicroStrategy holds in Bitcoin. Michael Saylor‚Äôs firm owns 607,770 BTC, or 2.9% of Bitcoin‚Äôs capped 21 million supply. BitMine‚Äôs rapid accumulation has flipped SharpLink Gaming, which recently announced a 79,949 ETH purchase, bringing its total holdings to 360,807 ETH, valued around $1.3 billion. The Ethereum Foundation ranks third among treasury holders with approximately 237,500 ETH. two companies are buying ETH like CRAZY ‚Äì Bitmine holds $2.12 billion in ETH ‚Äì SharpLink holds $1.35 billion in ETH the Ethereum Foundation is the 3rd largest holder ETH IS GOING TO $20,000 THIS CYCLE! pic.twitter.com/cQxx7Y6MRG ‚Äî borovik (@3orovik) July 24, 2025 The trend has fueled surging valuations. BitMine shares (BMNR) soared more than 3,000% to $135 following its Ether pivot in early July. SharpLink‚Äôs (SBET) stock spiked 171% to $79.21 after revealing similar plans in May. According to Strategic Ether Reserves, 61 entities now collectively hold 2.31 million ETH ‚Äî around 1.91% of the total supply, valued at $8.46 billion. While that figure pales in comparison to Bitcoin, where 206 companies control over 3.4 million BTC worth $408 billion, Ether treasuries are gaining ground fast. Crypto Treasuries Aren‚Äôt Really Buying Crypto A growing number of publicly traded companies are raising hundreds of millions of dollars to build crypto treasuries, but one analyst says many aren‚Äôt actually buying digital assets from the open market . As reported, crypto analyst Ran Neuner claimed that crypto treasury firms are acting less like buyers and more like exit vehicles for crypto insiders. Instead of purchasing assets directly from exchanges, these companies often receive crypto contributions from existing holders, in exchange for shares that later trade at massive premiums on public markets. Skepticism around the sustainability of the crypto treasury trend is also growing. Last month, Glassnode lead analyst James Check raised concerns over the longevity of the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, arguing the easy gains might already be gone for new entrants as the market matures. The warning echoes recent comments from Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, who has voiced concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms.

2025-07-25T04:25:23,"Historic Momentum: Spot Ethereum ETFs See Astonishing $231.23M Inflows, Fueling Market Optimism","BitcoinWorld Historic Momentum: Spot Ethereum ETFs See Astonishing $231.23M Inflows, Fueling Market Optimism The world of digital assets is buzzing with activity, and for good reason! In a significant development that underscores growing institutional confidence, U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a staggering total net inflow of $231.23 million on July 24. This marks an impressive streak, being the 15th consecutive day of net inflows, a testament to the increasing appetite for regulated cryptocurrency investment products. For anyone watching the evolution of crypto, this sustained momentum for Spot Ethereum ETFs is a clear signal of shifting tides. Unpacking the Phenomenal Inflows into Spot Ethereum ETFs The recent data, shared by astute market observer Trader T on X, paints a vivid picture of which players are leading the charge in the burgeoning Spot Ethereum ETFs market. While the overall figure is substantial, a closer look reveals the individual contributions that collectively pushed the net inflows past the quarter-billion-dollar mark. Fidelity‚Äôs FETH emerged as the dominant force, pulling in a massive $210.06 million. This substantial figure alone highlights Fidelity‚Äôs strong position and investor trust in their offering. Following Fidelity, Grayscale‚Äôs mini ETH saw a notable inflow of $25.34 million, indicating a healthy interest in their more accessible product. Bitwise‚Äôs ETHW also contributed significantly with $11.53 million, and Franklin‚Äôs EZET added $2.84 million to the positive ledger. However, it wasn‚Äôt all green; Grayscale‚Äôs ETHE, a converted trust, experienced an $18.54 million outflow, suggesting some investors might be reallocating from the older trust structure to newer, perhaps more efficient, ETF vehicles. The remaining ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day, indicating stability in their current investor base. To better visualize the contributions, here‚Äôs a breakdown of the inflows and outflows for the day: ETF Ticker Provider Net Inflow/Outflow (Millions USD) FETH Fidelity +$210.06 mini ETH Grayscale +$25.34 ETHW Bitwise +$11.53 EZET Franklin +$2.84 ETHE Grayscale -$18.54 Others Various $0.00 Total Net Inflow +$231.23 This consistent inflow streak underscores a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views digital assets, particularly Ethereum. It suggests that institutional players and sophisticated investors are increasingly comfortable allocating capital to regulated crypto products, viewing them as legitimate components of a diversified portfolio. What‚Äôs Fueling the Institutional Appetite for Spot Ethereum ETFs? The consistent and substantial inflows into Spot Ethereum ETFs are not happening in a vacuum. Several key factors are converging to create this surge in institutional interest. Understanding these drivers is crucial for grasping the broader implications for the cryptocurrency market. Regulatory Clarity and SEC Approval: The most significant catalyst has undoubtedly been the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs (SEC) approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs . This landmark decision provides a much-needed layer of legitimacy and regulatory clarity that was previously absent. For institutional investors, regulatory approval significantly de-risks their participation, opening doors to funds and mandates that previously could not touch direct crypto holdings. Ethereum‚Äôs Robust Ecosystem: Beyond just being a digital currency, Ethereum boasts a vibrant and continuously evolving ecosystem. It is the backbone for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and countless decentralized applications (dApps). Its transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism has also made it more energy-efficient and scalable, appealing to environmentally conscious investors and those looking for long-term sustainability. Diversification and Portfolio Enhancement: As institutions become more comfortable with Bitcoin as an alternative asset, Ethereum offers a compelling diversification play within the digital asset space. Its distinct use cases and economic model differentiate it from Bitcoin, potentially offering uncorrelated returns or unique growth opportunities within a broader digital asset allocation strategy. Accessibility and Familiarity: ETFs provide a familiar and accessible investment vehicle for traditional investors. They can buy and sell shares of Spot Ethereum ETFs through their existing brokerage accounts, bypassing the complexities of direct crypto custody, wallet management, and navigating decentralized exchanges. This ease of access significantly lowers the barrier to entry for a wide range of investors. Success of Bitcoin ETFs: The successful launch and subsequent performance of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs set a precedent. The substantial inflows into Bitcoin ETFs demonstrated a clear market demand for regulated crypto investment products, paving the way and building confidence for the approval and adoption of Ethereum counterparts. The Ripple Effect: How Spot Ethereum ETFs Impact the Broader Crypto Market The continued influx of capital into Spot Ethereum ETFs is more than just a win for the specific fund providers; it sends significant ripples throughout the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. This institutional embrace has far-reaching implications, influencing everything from market dynamics to public perception. Firstly, these inflows contribute to increased liquidity for Ethereum. As more capital flows into the underlying asset to back the ETF shares, it deepens the market, potentially leading to more stable price action and reduced volatility over time. While short-term volatility remains inherent to crypto, institutional liquidity can act as a stabilizing force in the long run. Secondly, the approval and success of Spot Ethereum ETFs serve as a powerful validation for Ethereum as a legitimate, investable asset class. This institutional stamp of approval can encourage further adoption by retail investors and corporations who may have previously been hesitant due to perceived risks or lack of regulatory clarity. It normalizes crypto as part of the broader financial landscape. Furthermore, the demand generated by these ETFs can put upward pressure on Ethereum‚Äôs price. As fund managers acquire ETH to match investor demand for ETF shares, it reduces the available supply on exchanges, potentially driving up its value. This can create a positive feedback loop, attracting more investors and further cementing Ethereum‚Äôs position as a leading digital asset. Finally, the success of Spot Ethereum ETFs could pave the way for other altcoin ETFs. If regulators and investors see consistent demand and responsible management, it might open the door for similar products based on other prominent cryptocurrencies, further expanding the reach of regulated crypto investments in traditional finance. Navigating the Waters: What Challenges Lie Ahead for Spot Ethereum ETFs? While the current outlook for Spot Ethereum ETFs is overwhelmingly positive, it‚Äôs essential to approach the future with a balanced perspective. Like any nascent financial product in a rapidly evolving market, these ETFs face potential challenges and risks that investors should be aware of. Market Volatility: Despite institutional interest, the underlying asset, Ethereum, remains highly volatile. Prices can fluctuate dramatically based on market sentiment, macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, and technological developments. While ETFs offer exposure, they do not eliminate the inherent price risk of the underlying cryptocurrency. Regulatory Scrutiny and Evolution: Although approved, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Future legislative changes, new interpretations of existing laws, or increased scrutiny from global regulators could impact the operation or even the existence of these ETFs. The SEC‚Äôs stance, while currently favorable, could shift or impose new requirements. Competition and Fee Wars: As more providers enter the market, competition among Spot Ethereum ETFs could intensify. This might lead to ‚Äòfee wars,‚Äô where providers lower their management fees to attract investors. While beneficial for investors, it could put pressure on the profitability of fund managers and potentially lead to consolidation in the market. Custody and Security Risks: While ETFs abstract away direct custody for investors, the underlying Ethereum held by the fund providers is still subject to security risks, including hacks, exploits, or operational failures. Robust security measures and reputable custodians are paramount, but no system is entirely foolproof. Liquidity and Spreads: While institutional inflows generally increase liquidity, there might be periods where ETF trading volumes are low, leading to wider bid-ask spreads. This could result in investors buying at a slightly higher price or selling at a lower price than the underlying asset‚Äôs true value, impacting their returns. ‚ÄòSell the News‚Äô Events: Following initial excitement and inflows, there‚Äôs always a possibility of a ‚Äòsell the news‚Äô event. Once the initial hype around the launch subsides, some early investors might take profits, leading to temporary outflows or price corrections for both the ETF and the underlying ETH. Looking Ahead: The Future Trajectory of Spot Ethereum ETFs The consistent inflows into Spot Ethereum ETFs paint a promising picture for the future of digital asset investment. As these products mature and gain wider acceptance, their trajectory could mirror, or even surpass, the success seen with spot Bitcoin ETFs. We can anticipate continued growth in assets under management (AUM) for these funds as more financial advisors and institutional platforms integrate them into their offerings. This integration will further bridge the gap between traditional finance and the crypto world, making Ethereum accessible to an even broader audience who prefer regulated, familiar investment vehicles. Furthermore, the market may see the introduction of more sophisticated Spot Ethereum ETFs products. While current offerings are largely spot-based, future iterations could explore features like staking yield integration, allowing investors to potentially earn rewards from Ethereum‚Äôs Proof-of-Stake mechanism directly through their ETF holdings. This would add another layer of appeal and potential returns for investors. The long-term impact of these ETFs extends beyond mere investment vehicles. They contribute to the overall legitimization and maturation of the cryptocurrency market. By providing regulated pathways, they enhance market integrity, foster greater transparency, and encourage institutional participation, ultimately solidifying Ethereum‚Äôs role as a foundational asset in the evolving digital economy. In conclusion, the sustained inflow into U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs is a powerful indicator of institutional confidence and growing mainstream acceptance of digital assets. While challenges remain, the current momentum suggests a bright future for Ethereum‚Äôs integration into traditional financial portfolios. Investors and enthusiasts alike should keep a close watch on these developments, as they are likely to shape the landscape of crypto investment for years to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a Spot Ethereum ETF? A Spot Ethereum ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) is an investment vehicle that holds actual Ethereum (ETH) as its underlying asset. It allows investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Ethereum without directly owning or needing to custody the cryptocurrency themselves. Shares of the ETF can be bought and sold on traditional stock exchanges, just like shares of a company. 2. Why are Spot Ethereum ETFs seeing such high inflows? The high inflows are primarily driven by the recent regulatory approval by the U.S. SEC, which provides legitimacy and reduces risk for institutional investors. Additionally, Ethereum‚Äôs robust ecosystem (DeFi, NFTs), its transition to Proof-of-Stake, the success of Bitcoin ETFs, and the ease of access provided by the ETF structure are all contributing factors. 3. Which companies are offering Spot Ethereum ETFs? Currently, major financial institutions like Fidelity, Grayscale (with its mini ETH product), Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton are among the prominent providers offering U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs. More providers may enter the market as demand grows. 4. How do Spot Ethereum ETFs differ from Grayscale‚Äôs ETHE? Grayscale‚Äôs ETHE (Ethereum Trust) was a closed-end trust that traded over-the-counter and often at a discount or premium to its net asset value (NAV). Spot Ethereum ETFs, on the other hand, are designed to trade closer to their NAV due to their creation and redemption mechanisms, offering better price discovery and liquidity. ETHE‚Äôs recent outflow suggests investors are moving from the older trust structure to the more efficient ETF. 5. What are the potential risks of investing in Spot Ethereum ETFs? Key risks include the inherent volatility of Ethereum‚Äôs price, evolving regulatory landscapes, potential competition leading to fee wars, security risks associated with the underlying asset‚Äôs custody, and the possibility of ‚Äòsell the news‚Äô events after initial excitement. Investors should always conduct thorough due diligence. 6. What is the long-term outlook for Spot Ethereum ETFs? The long-term outlook is generally positive. Continued institutional adoption, potential for more sophisticated product offerings (like staking yield integration), and the legitimization of Ethereum as a mainstream asset class are expected. Their success could also pave the way for ETFs based on other cryptocurrencies, further integrating digital assets into traditional finance. Did you find this article insightful?

2025-07-25T04:10:23,"Bitcoin Transfer: Unpacking Galaxy Digital‚Äôs Massive $404M Move and Its Market Impact","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Transfer: Unpacking Galaxy Digital‚Äôs Massive $404M Move and Its Market Impact The cryptocurrency world is no stranger to significant movements, but when a prominent player like Galaxy Digital makes a substantial Bitcoin transfer , it certainly grabs attention. Recently, the crypto financial firm executed a staggering $404 million Bitcoin transfer to multiple centralized exchanges, a move that has sparked considerable discussion and speculation across the digital asset landscape. This kind of large-scale activity, often termed ‚Äòwhale movements,‚Äô is closely monitored by investors and analysts for its potential implications on market liquidity, sentiment, and future price action. Understanding the nuances of this particular Bitcoin transfer is crucial for anyone keen on deciphering the complex signals within the crypto market. Unpacking Galaxy Digital‚Äôs Strategic Bitcoin Transfer: What Exactly Happened? In a series of rapid transactions, Galaxy Digital, a well-known name in institutional crypto services, made two distinct, massive Bitcoin transfer operations. According to on-chain data provided by Arkham Intelligence, these movements unfolded swiftly, leaving market observers to ponder their intent and potential impact. Initial Exchange Deposit: The first and largest Bitcoin transfer involved 3,500 BTC, valued at approximately $404 million at the time, moved to several centralized exchanges. This action typically suggests an intent to increase liquidity, potentially for selling, rebalancing portfolios, or facilitating over-the-counter (OTC) deals. The sheer volume of this deposit is what immediately caught the eye of the market. Subsequent Anonymous Transfer: Shortly after the initial deposit, Galaxy Digital executed another significant Bitcoin transfer of 1,500 BTC, roughly $176 million, to six anonymous addresses. This second movement introduces an element of mystery, as transfers to unknown wallets could indicate various strategies, including cold storage for security, internal treasury management, or preparation for future private transactions away from public exchange order books. These dual movements underscore the sophisticated nature of institutional crypto operations, where large sums are moved with specific strategic objectives. The timing and destination of these funds are key indicators for analysts attempting to predict market shifts. Why Does a Large Bitcoin Transfer Matter? Understanding Whale Movements When entities like Galaxy Digital move such colossal amounts of Bitcoin, it‚Äôs not just another transaction; it‚Äôs a ‚Äòwhale movement‚Äô that can send ripples through the market. But why are these large-scale Bitcoin transfer events so significant? Potential Market Impact: Selling Pressure: The most immediate concern when large amounts of BTC are sent to exchanges is the potential for selling. If these Bitcoins are indeed sold, it could increase supply on exchanges, potentially leading to downward price pressure, especially if demand doesn‚Äôt match the increased supply. Liquidity Management: Institutions often need to manage their liquidity. Moving Bitcoin to exchanges might be a preparatory step for converting BTC into fiat or other cryptocurrencies to meet operational needs, invest in new assets, or fulfill client redemption requests. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Not all Bitcoin moved to exchanges is for immediate public sale. Sometimes, large holders facilitate OTC deals, where large blocks of crypto are traded directly between parties without impacting public exchange order books. However, the initial deposit to an exchange might be a precursor to such a deal. Portfolio Rebalancing: Institutional investors frequently rebalance their portfolios to manage risk or adjust exposure to different assets based on market conditions or strategic outlooks. A large Bitcoin transfer could be part of a broader rebalancing strategy. Market Sentiment: Large movements can influence market psychology. If interpreted as a sign of impending sell-offs, it can trigger fear (FUD) among retail investors, potentially leading to broader market declines. Conversely, if interpreted as strategic positioning for future growth, it could boost confidence. Understanding the ‚Äòwhy‚Äô behind a major Bitcoin transfer requires looking beyond the raw data and considering the broader context of the firm‚Äôs operations and market conditions. The Role of On-Chain Analytics: Peeking Behind the Bitcoin Transfer Curtain How do we even know about these massive transfers? This is where on-chain analytics platforms like Arkham Intelligence become indispensable. These tools provide unparalleled transparency into the otherwise opaque world of cryptocurrency transactions. What On-Chain Data Reveals: Transaction Details: On-chain data logs every transaction, including sender and receiver addresses, amounts, and timestamps. This allows analysts to track the flow of funds across the blockchain. Entity Identification: Advanced analytics platforms like Arkham specialize in identifying and labeling addresses belonging to known entities, such as exchanges, institutions, and prominent whales. This attribution is crucial for understanding who is moving funds. Historical Context: By analyzing historical data, patterns of behavior can be identified. For instance, if a wallet frequently sends funds to exchanges before a price dip, it might indicate a selling pattern. While on-chain data offers incredible insights, it‚Äôs not without its challenges. Interpreting the intent behind a Bitcoin transfer can be complex, as a single transaction can have multiple underlying reasons. Analysts must combine on-chain observations with broader market news, macroeconomic factors, and the known strategies of the entities involved to form a comprehensive picture. Immediate Repercussions and Future Outlook for Bitcoin After This Transfer The immediate aftermath of a significant Bitcoin transfer like Galaxy Digital‚Äôs can vary. While some transfers cause immediate price volatility, others might be absorbed by the market without much fanfare, especially if the liquidity is deep or the intent is not immediate selling pressure. Potential Market Responses: Scenario Potential Market Reaction Rationale Immediate Selling Short-term price dip for Bitcoin Increased supply on exchanges without matching demand. OTC Deal Execution Minimal or no public price impact Funds are transferred off-exchange or via private agreements. Liquidity Provision Increased market depth, potentially less volatility More BTC available for trading, improving market efficiency. Rebalancing/Treasury Management Neutral to slightly positive sentiment Seen as a professional, strategic move rather than a panic sale. It‚Äôs important to note that the market‚Äôs reaction is not always direct or immediate. Often, it‚Äôs the cumulative effect of several large transfers, combined with prevailing macroeconomic conditions and market narratives, that dictates price action. The anonymous transfers, for instance, could signify a long-term holding strategy or a shift to cold storage, which might be interpreted as a bullish signal in the long run. Navigating the Crypto Waters: Actionable Insights for Investors For individual investors, staying informed about major Bitcoin transfer events is crucial, but equally important is knowing how to react without succumbing to fear or irrational exuberance. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor On-Chain Data (But Don‚Äôt Overreact): While tools like Arkham provide valuable insights, interpret them cautiously. A large transfer doesn‚Äôt automatically mean a crash. Look for patterns, context, and confirmation from multiple sources. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Galaxy Digital? Galaxy Digital is a diversified financial services and investment management company specializing in the digital asset, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology sectors. Founded by Michael Novogratz, it provides a range of services including trading, asset management, investment banking, and principal investments to institutional and high-net-worth clients. Why would Galaxy Digital transfer such a large amount of Bitcoin? There are several potential reasons for a large Bitcoin transfer by an institutional firm like Galaxy Digital. These include increasing liquidity for potential sales or operational needs, rebalancing their portfolio, facilitating over-the-counter (OTC) deals with large clients, or moving funds for enhanced security into cold storage or new addresses for internal treasury management. How does a large Bitcoin transfer affect the market? A large Bitcoin transfer , especially to exchanges, can create selling pressure if the funds are intended for immediate liquidation, potentially leading to short-term price dips. Conversely, if the transfer is for OTC deals or rebalancing, the market impact might be minimal. These movements also influence market sentiment, as investors interpret them as bullish or bearish signals. What is Arkham data and why is it important?

Should I be concerned about this specific Bitcoin transfer? While a significant Bitcoin transfer like this warrants attention, it‚Äôs not necessarily a cause for alarm. Institutional movements are often strategic and multi-faceted. Instead of immediate concern, use it as an opportunity to understand market dynamics better, monitor subsequent developments, and ensure your own investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and long-term goals.

2025-07-25T04:00:58,"Bitcoin Rally Signal? Analyst Links Binance Spot Volume Surges To Price Upswings","Bitcoin (BTC) may be on the cusp of another rally, as leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance saw its spot volume rise from around 40% on July 15 to as high as 60% on July 18. Historical data suggests that surges in Binance‚Äôs spot market share have frequently preceded upward movements in BTC‚Äôs price. Bitcoin Rally Imminent? Binance Data Suggests So According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Amr Taha, Binance‚Äôs spot volume market share surging to 58% on July 23, has further strengthened the premier cryptocurrency‚Äôs $117,000 support. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Long-Term Holders Sell As Short-Term Buyers Step In ‚Äì Sign Of Rally Exhaustion? This marks the second notable spike in Binance‚Äôs spot market dominance this month. On July 18, Binance‚Äôs share surged to 60%, coinciding with Bitcoin holding above the critical $117,000 mark on the daily chart. Since then, the $117,000 level has served as a reliable support zone, likely buoyed by Binance‚Äôs deep liquidity and high execution reliability. Price stability at this level has been observed multiple times since the initial breakout. In addition to this, Bitcoin‚Äôs price has shown strong resilience around the Realized Price of the 1-day to 1-week Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) Age Band, which is currently near $118,300. For context, UTXO age bands classify Bitcoin held in wallets based on how long it has remained unspent, offering insight into investor behavior. Shorter bands ‚Äì 1 day to 1 week ‚Äì typically reflect activity by newer or speculative holders, while longer bands ‚Äì 6 months to 5 years ‚Äì are associated with long-term holders with stronger conviction. Taha explained: Historically, this metric acts as a dynamic support level, indicating that newer holders are not capitulating and that the average on-chain cost basis of recent buyers is being respected by the market. Meanwhile, fellow crypto analyst Titan of Crypto took to X to highlight BTC following the bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern. In an X post, the analyst shared the following weekly chart, adding that BTC is on track to hit a target of $144,000. Will BTC Hit $180,000 By Year End? Bitcoin‚Äôs recent all-time high (ATH) of $123,218 has reignited speculation around even higher price targets before year‚Äôs end. According to CryptoQuant analyst Chairman Lee, BTC remains on track to reach $180,000 by the end of 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Not Over Yet? Short-Term Holder MVRV Suggests Further Upside Recent on-chain metrics support this bullish outlook. Notably, the Bitcoin IFP indicator suggests that major holders continue to hold BTC despite its proximity to record highs ‚Äì unlike in previous cycles, where exchange inflows typically preceded significant corrections. However, not all indicators point upward. Exchange reserves recently reached their highest levels since June 25, raising concerns about potential sell pressure. At press time, BTC is trading at $119,097, up 0.6% in the past 24 hours.
