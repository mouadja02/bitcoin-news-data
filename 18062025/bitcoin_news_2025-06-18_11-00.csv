2025-06-18T08:53:20,"Bitcoin Price Settles at $105K Ahead of US Fed’s Interest Rate Decision Today (Market Watch)","The volatile bitcoin price moves continued in the past 24 hours due to the quickly developing situation in the Middle East, but the asset seemed to have calmed at around $105,000. However, more fluctuations are expected today as the US Federal Reserve concludes its fourth FOMC meeting of the year, although most anticipate no changes in interest rates. BTC Back to $105K Israel’s rather surprising attack against Iran last Friday morning caused an immediate turmoil in the cryptocurrency market, as bitcoin slumped from $108,400 to under $103,000 within hours. Although both sides continued to exchange missile blows for the next several days, BTC started to recover some ground over the weekend and even went on the offensive at the start of the current business week. The culmination transpired on Monday evening and Tuesday morning when the bulls drove the primary cryptocurrency to a multi-day peak of roughly $109,000. However, the asset faced immediate rejection at that point and was pushed south hard once again. After the latest developments on the Middle East front, which include Trump’s threats against Iran, bitcoin plunged beneath $103,500 yesterday. It has bounced off since then and even tapped $105,600, but that was short-lived, and the asset is back to just under $105,000 now. As mentioned above, volatility is expected to pick up later today as the US Fed will announce its interest rate decision. For now, BTC’s market cap has dropped below $2.090 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is close to 62%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts in Red Most altcoins have registered further losses over the past day. Ethereum is close to breaking below $2,500 after another minor decline, while XRP has dumped to $2.15 following a 3% drop. SOL, HYPE, ADA, LINK, UNI, and PEPE have marked similar losses, while SUI has plunged by over 6%. The top performers from the largest 100 alts include KAIA (5%), SEI (2%), and NEXO (2%). In contrast, SKY, FARTCOIN, TKX, and VIRTUAL have lost the most value. The total crypto market cap has declined by another $60 billion in a day and is down to $3.380 trillion on CG.

While headlines focus on ETFs, memecoins, and AI integrations, miners are still the ones building the foundation of value in crypto — and they’re demanding better tools. Enter EMCD, one of the world’s top 10 Bitcoin mining pools and a rapidly expanding crypto-fintech ecosystem. Since launching in 2017, EMCD has evolved into a full-service platform for miners, offering instant asset swaps, hosted mining solutions, high-yield savings, and multi-coin support — all in one place. In an industry that often overpromises and underdelivers, EMCD is delivering consistent results, serving over 400 000 people in more than 120 countries and maintaining a real-time BTC pool hashrate of 23.67 EH/s. Built for Today’s Miners, Not Just Traders EMCD’s vision is simple: empower miners with the tools they need to maximize earnings, protect profits, and stay in control. Unlike trading-first platforms or passive wallet apps, EMCD’s ecosystem is optimized for active, income-focused users who live by the block reward. With support for 14+ mineable coins, including BTC, LTC, BCH, DOGE, DASH, KAS, and merged mining, EMCD helps users diversify their earnings across chains — and convert them instantly when needed. Complex: A Turnkey Mining Solution That’s Gaining Global Momentum One of EMCD’s standout offerings in 2025 is EMCD Complex, a remote mining service that lets users purchase ASIC hardware, hosted and maintained by EMCD. It’s fully plug-and-play: mining begins on the same day of payment, with 0% pool fees through the end of 2025. Complex is gaining popularity in Latin America, Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia, where users want direct exposure to mining income without infrastructure headaches. Ownership remains with the user, and EMCD handles everything else — from setup and optimization to energy and firmware updates. EMCD Exchange: Instant Swaps, No Third Parties With price volatility increasing, miners can’t afford delays. EMCD Exchange, the built-in swap feature, allows users to convert BTC and other rewards into USDT and stablecoins instantly — all without leaving the dashboard. This is a major benefit during market rallies or sudden drops, when locking in gains or protecting capital is time-sensitive. The service offers competitive spreads, low fees, and no transfer friction — a key edge over traditional centralized exchanges. Maximize Idle Funds With Up to 14% APY In a year where capital efficiency matters more than ever, EMCD offers a high-yield savings wallet where users can earn up to 14% APY on stablecoin balances. These earnings can be used to offset pool fees, cover Complex hosting, or reinvest automatically — turning passive balances into active revenue. The feature is popular among miners looking for low-risk, custodial alternatives to DeFi, without sacrificing yield. Transparency, Automation, and Total Control EMCD provides full visibility across operations, with: Real-time hashrate and mining stats Customizable payout settings Auto tax reports Mobile apps for iOS and Android Round-the-clock support from mining experts The platform’s infrastructure is ISO-compliant and tested under high-load conditions, ensuring security and uptime even in volatile network environments. A Trusted Name in Emerging Mining Markets EMCD has seen rapid growth in emerging regions — especially Brazil, Argentina, Ukraine, Turkey, and Vietnam — where mining offers a real hedge against inflation and fiat instability. With localized interfaces, fast onboarding, and flexible tools for small- to mid-scale operators, EMCD is increasingly seen as the platform of choice for a new wave of miners — from freelancers and tech workers to professional crypto entrepreneurs. What’s Next for EMCD in 2025? The roadmap includes: New mining algorithm support, including GPU-friendly coins Expansion of swap pairs and liquidity pools Hashrate-backed lending solutions Closer integration with DeFi and staking infrastructure EMCD is also exploring partnerships with hardware manufacturers and institutional custody providers, setting the stage for broader integrations in the Web3 economy. Conclusion In a space that moves fast and often feels fragmented, EMCD is quietly building the infrastructure that miners actually want: simple, scalable, and smart. For users who earn block by block — and think long-term — EMCD offers a real alternative to the patchwork of wallets, exchanges, and cloud services. It’s mining, money, and management all in one ecosystem.

On June 18, Nobitex posted a statement on X acknowledging the incident, stating that unauthorized access had been detected in its hot wallet and reporting infrastructure earlier that morning. The platform promised to use its insurance fund and internal reserves to fully compensate impacted clients and reassured users that cold-stored funds would remain safe. اطلاعیه در خصوص حادثه امنیتی صبح امروز ۲۸ خرداد، تیم فنی ما نشانه‌هایی از دسترسی غیرمجاز به بخشی از زیرساخت‌های اطلاع‌رسانی و کیف پول گرم را شناسایی کرده است. بلافاصله پس از تشخیص، تمام دسترسی‌ها متوقف شد و تیم‌های امنیتی داخلی ما در حال بررسی دقیق ابعاد این حادثه هستند. یادآور… — Nobitex | نوبیتکس (@nobitexmarket) June 18, 2025 While the exchange hasn’t disclosed information regarding the amount lost, blockchain investigator ZachXBT has provided an update on Telegram. ZachXBT flagged multiple suspicious outflows involving Bitcoin ( BTC ), Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Tron ( TRX ), and various EVM-compatible chains, estimating the loss to be around $81.7 million.

Iranian missile fire retaliated against Israeli airstrikes that targeted military and nuclear facilities throughout Tehran on June 13. Days later, the Nobitex cyberattack seems to reflect those battlefield dynamics, pointing to a well-coordinated digital front in the ongoing war. In the past, Gonjeshke Darande has attacked Iranian institutions like fuel distribution networks and Bank Sepah, often coordinating its attacks with geopolitical events. Although Israel has never formally acknowledged ties, analysts believe the group is supported by Israeli cyber units such as Unit 8200. Nobitex, a major player in Iran’s cryptocurrency market, has come under fire in recent years for allegedly facilitating transactions with sanctioned entities. Nearly $8 billion in transactions between Nobitex and Binance occurred between 2018 and 2022, according to a report by Reuters. While the full extent of the damage is still being investigated, the timing and messaging of the attack point to a larger attempt to interrupt Iran’s digital financial infrastructure amid rising regional tensions.

2025-06-18T08:45:45,"Bitmain, Canaan, MicroBT flee tariffs with U.S. assembly","Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT — the three biggest Chinese bitcoin mining rig manufacturers — are now building their machines in the United States. They’re doing it to get around new tariffs rolled out by Trump, whose second term in the Oval has been hammering Chinese tech imports. All three companies build more than 90% of the world’s mining rigs, and they’ve decided to move production across the Pacific rather than pay the price of staying in China. Bitmain was the first to make a move. The company started assembling rigs inside the US last December, just weeks after Trump won the election. Canaan soon followed, launching test production inside the US to sidestep the 30% total import tax that Trump slapped on Chinese-made tech. Speaking to Reuters, Leo Wang, Canaan’s vice president of corporate development and capital markets, said the new US project is “exploratory” because the trade policy is still unpredictable. MicroBT, ranked third globally, said in a statement that it’s now “actively implementing a localization strategy” in the US to avoid the financial hit. Bitmain, Canaan and MicroBT chase US safety net as crypto tech faces security heat The three firms aren’t moving just for fun. They’re trying to protect their global sales and keep their American customers. According to Reuters, Guang Yang, chief technology officer at Conflux Network, said, “The US-China trade war is triggering structural, not superficial, changes in bitcoin’s supply chains.” Guang also pointed out that for American businesses, “this goes beyond tariffs. It’s a strategic pivot toward ‘politically acceptable’ hardware sources.” Right now, these three companies control the top of the global crypto food chain. They build the machines that mine bitcoin, which in turn rely on massive energy supplies, cloud infrastructure, and trading systems. Frost & Sullivan estimated that by the end of 2023, Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT were responsible for 95.4% of computing power sold worldwide. That’s a monopoly, and it’s got US firms rattled. Sanjay Gupta, chief strategy officer at US-based crypto hardware firm Auradine, said this isn’t a small issue. “While over 30% of global bitcoin mining occurs in North America, more than 90% of mining hardware originates from China representing a major imbalance of geographic demand and supply,” he told Reuters. Sanjay also warned that “hundreds of thousands of them connected to the US electrical grid is a security risk.” Leo Wang pushed back. He said the mining machines aren’t a danger. “They are useless if not applied to bitcoin mining,” he explained. But Leo admitted that the companies could still get hit with broader US crackdowns on Chinese high-tech exports. That’s already happening. Bitmain’s AI division, Sophgo , was blacklisted by the US government for national security concerns. Trump’s crypto push runs into China’s hardware dominance Back in 2021, China banned crypto entirely, claiming it was a threat to financial stability. At the time, the country controlled everything from rig production to mining and exchanges. Once Beijing made crypto illegal, most of the trading firms and mining businesses fled overseas. But Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT stayed relevant because they still made the hardware. They stayed on top by building high-performance chips that worked better than anything Western firms could come up with. They also had the advantage of being the first ones to scale. Canaan later moved its headquarters from China to Singapore, though it still has operations in China. It also opened a pilot production line inside the US, where it made 40% of its total revenue last year. “The rationale is to try to reduce the cost for both us and our customers,” Leo said. With Trump adding more pressure, he said they have “to explore all alternatives.” Trump has declared himself the “crypto president.” His son, Eric Trump, teamed up with Hut 8 to launch American Bitcoin, a miner that plans to build a national crypto reserve. But this whole “America-first” crypto dream is stuck with one problem — almost every mining rig still comes from China. John Deaton, a US attorney who works on crypto law, said the situation could get dangerous. “If China restricts exports or manipulates supply, it could disrupt bitcoin’s network stability and affect US users and investors,” he said. The biggest US-based mining companies — MARA, CleanSpark, Riot Platforms, and Core Scientific — are all relying on imported Chinese hardware to power their farms.

2025-06-18T08:42:00,"Bitcoin Price Aims for $112,500—Neo Pepe Coin Breaks 1.1 Million in Presale","Bitcoin Resurgence Sparks Market-Wide Optimism Bitcoin (BTC) is back in the spotlight as bullish momentum drives its price toward an ambitious target of $112,500, reigniting overall crypto market confidence. After a period of consolidation and indecision, this upswing isn’t just elevating BTC; it’s injecting renewed enthusiasm into altcoins and early-stage investment opportunities. Historically, BTC rallies inspire speculative capital flow into smaller, high-beta cryptocurrencies—exactly what’s happening now in 2025, drawing significant investor attention toward promising projects like Neo Pepe Coin . Market dynamics clearly illustrate how Bitcoin’s positive price action creates a ripple effect across the crypto ecosystem. As investors gain confidence in BTC’s resilience and potential for further growth, risk tolerance increases, leading capital to flow into altcoins perceived to have greater short-to-medium-term upside. Neo Pepe Protocol Takes Meme Coins to Serious Heights As Bitcoin’s rally gathers steam, investors seeking exponential returns are shifting their focus to high-potential alternatives such as Neo Pepe Protocol. Unlike traditional meme coins that thrive solely on viral hype and short-term speculation, Neo Pepe Protocol embeds robust fundamentals beneath its bold symbolism of decentralization, rebellion against financial control, and the broader establishment. Already surpassing $1.1 Million in its presale, Neo Pepe Coin is rapidly gaining recognition as a frontrunner in the meme coin space. The protocol prioritizes transparent, community-led governance through its sophisticated DAO model, bolstered by a smart-contract-managed treasury and structured tokenomics. These strong fundamentals underscore Neo Pepe Protocol’s long-term viability and differentiate it from typical meme tokens. What Makes Neo Pepe Protocol Stand Out? Here are four key features that position Neo Pepe Coin as a leading meme coin in 2025: Decentralized Governance and DAO Control: Community-driven decision-making via on-chain proposals ensures every token holder has a voice. Transparent voting mechanisms and execution delays are implemented to safeguard collective interests and prevent manipulation or rushed decision-making. Structured, Progressive Presale: A meticulously planned 16-stage presale features incrementally increasing token prices at each stage, encouraging early adoption. Early supporters are rewarded significantly, while token allocations are capped per stage to maintain exclusivity, urgency, and fairness. Auto-Liquidity and Deflationary Mechanics: Each transaction carries a permanent 2.5% liquidity fee automatically directed into Uniswap pools. Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens generated through this process are immediately burned, permanently locking liquidity and enhancing price stability and investor trust. Robust Smart Contract Infrastructure: Neo Pepe leverages a secure, non-upgradable architecture utilizing proven OpenZeppelin standards, eliminating the risk of future centralization or unauthorized changes. Immutable smart contracts ensure the protocol remains fully decentralized, transparent, and secure from centralized control or unforeseen updates. Gems Booster’s Neo Pepe Breakdown In their latest video, Gems Booster explores Neo Pepe Coin with clarity and nuance, highlighting the appealing elements of the coin’s innovative presale, including its carefully structured 16-stage pricing model designed to enhance investor interest. They emphasize Neo Pepe’s distinctive auto-liquidity system as a standout advantage, alongside praising the project’s community-centric governance, noting these as signs of a thoughtfully designed token. While Gems Booster acknowledges the uncertainties inherent in any crypto investment, their approach is optimistic overall, suggesting Neo Pepe has notable potential to resonate positively within the market. Bitcoin’s Rally Fuels Neo Pepe Coin’s Momentum With Bitcoin continuing its upward trajectory, the positive market sentiment significantly benefits structured, fundamentally sound altcoins like Neo Pepe Protocol. The protocol uniquely capitalizes on this trend through its innovative and transparent presale structure, which incorporates gamified elements such as real-time leaderboards and competitive participation incentives. These features entice both speculative traders seeking immediate returns and long-term investors drawn by solid fundamentals and community governance. The distinctive combination of cultural appeal, strategic tokenomics, accountability, and transparency positions Neo Pepe Coin not merely as another meme coin but as a credible decentralized ecosystem poised to ride the current wave of crypto market enthusiasm.

2025-06-18T08:39:36,"Next Technology Holding: A Confusing Bet On Bitcoin With AI Promises","Summary Next Technology, rebranded from WeTrade in 2024, markets itself as AI-SaaS, yet currently functions primarily as a Bitcoin holding vehicle. Interestingly, NXTT has accumulated 5,833 Bitcoin so far, while issuing shares and warrants, causing substantial shareholder dilution. Still, the company itself generates no service revenues. Their only profits stem from unrealized gains from Bitcoin holdings. Ultimately, I think NXTT is basically a play on the price of Bitcoin. However, it has many more risks without a commensurate added upside. So, I think it’s worth passing. Next Technology Holding Inc. ( NXTT ) presents itself as an AI-driven SaaS innovator with ambitions to reshape SaaS services for small businesses in China. Its financial reality tells a different story because it hasn’t generated revenues from software and relies solely on the price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) to generate profits. During April and May 2025, the company came close to being delisted due to its stock price dropping below $1.00. And since then, they’ve doubled down on their Bitcoin holding strategy by issuing new shares and warrants, diluting shareholders, and purchasing over 5,800 BTC. Interestingly, I think their Bitcoin strategy might even be viable by itself, assuming it continues appreciating over time. However, I think its strategic vision seems rather confusing in practice, and there’s no major valuation mismatch relative to its Bitcoin holdings. So, ultimately, I deem NXTT a “Hold” at these levels. A Bitcoin Play With An AI Narrative Next Technology Holding is effectively a technology holding company that was founded back on March 28, 2019, under the name WeTrade Group Inc . However, it was later rebranded to its current name in April 2024. NXTT is currently headquartered in Shenzhen, China, with service arrangements in the US, Hong Kong, and Singapore. It’s also an extremely lean operation, as it has only around six employees. It’s also worth mentioning that their previous name was closely tied to their previous internal power struggles and conflicting control claims. Source: Next Technology Holding Website. Retrieved June 15, 2025. However, post-rebranding, NXTT has shifted from a pure-play social e-commerce SaaS company in China to a basically tech holding company with a focus on Bitcoin. The idea is similar in spirit to MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ), with a consulting business that generates revenues that are converted into treasury holdings of Bitcoin. Likewise, NXTT seems to want to produce AI-enabled SaaS products to create sales and accumulate Bitcoin. However, as of Q1 2025, they haven’t generated any revenues. Nevertheless, NXTT technically develops Software-as-a-Service [SaaS] solutions for diverse industries using artificial intelligence [AI], big data, and machine learning. Its main product is called YCloud, which is a cloud intelligence system for multichannel analytics, social recommendation, and tools for supply chain. YCloud is supposedly tailored for small online retailers in China. NXTT claims to use its social e-commerce model in China to enhance analytics and recommendations via YCloud. Source: Next Technology Holding Website. Retrieved June 15, 2025. This way, NXTT has a dual focus on software services and crypto asset holdings on paper. But it’s mostly exposed to the volatile crypto market price swings, in particular Bitcoin. Also, since they don’t really generate any revenues at the moment, NXTT has resorted to issuing equity and warrants to raise capital. Such fresh capital is then reinvested into its Bitcoin treasury, which is recorded as “digital assets” in its balance sheet. Price Surge Fueled by Bitcoin Having said that, during April and May 2025, NXTT came very close to a potential Nasdaq delisting due to a low share price. The Nasdaq issued NXTT a non-compliance notice because its closing bid price remained under $1.00 for 30 consecutive business days and granted a 180-calendar-day cure period until October 2025 to regain compliance. And as you might imagine, a delisted security loses a lot of access to capital markets, which so far have been NXTT’s main funding source. Source: Next Technology Holding Website. Retrieved June 15, 2025. Shortly after that, in early May 2025, NXTT disclosed it had purchased approximately 5,833 Bitcoins. In fact, since the end of 2024, NXTT added a whopping 5,000 Bitcoin to its balance sheet, raising its balance to 5,833. So it was actually a savvy investment since by May 2025, each Bitcoin was trading around the $90,000 level. These are basically unrealized gains that show up as “Other Income” on their financials. And so far, it doesn’t seem like they intend on realizing those gains, from what I can tell. Still, their big bet on Bitcoin prompted a substantial rally in NXTT shares, which reached a high of $3.27, around the middle of May 2025. Also, since the shares are again above the $1.00 threshold on the Nasdaq, it further eases any delisting concerns for the time being. Unfortunately, it seems NXTT stock is back again around $1.40 at the time of this writing, despite Bitcoin trading much above $100,000. This is probably because around the same time, NXTT also issued approximately 135 million new shares and 294 million warrants as payment for acquiring the aforementioned 5,000 Bitcoins. Rather than pay in cash, the company used its equity and diluted shareholders to double down on Bitcoin. Source: Seeking Alpha Charts. Moreover, NXTT also seemed again on track to develop its AI innovation and expansion objectives from early 2025. You see, in January 2025, NXTT had previously announced an upgrade to its YCloud platform by integrating DeepSeek’s models. The idea was to use this AI model for code generation, chatbots, and predictive analytics, essentially positioning this upgrade as a game-changer for efficiency and customer experience. And, as you might imagine, their paper gains on Bitcoin could help them fund these types of projects. However, according to their Q1 2025 report, NXTT hasn’t generated any service revenues yet. Valuation And Risk Analysis Now, from a valuation perspective, NXTT trades at a $527.9 million market cap, so it’s still a relatively small company for the most part. Their latest financial report shows they hold the majority of their liquid assets in “digital assets,” namely Bitcoin. You see, NXTT’s actual cash and equivalents stand at just $668.4 thousand. However, they hold an impressive 5,833 Bitcoins, which they valued at $481.7 million as of Q1 2025. In fact, at the current Bitcoin price of approximately $107 thousand, their main asset is actually worth a bit more, closer to $624.1 million. Also, in NXTT’s defense, they don’t have any financial debt other than regular operating liabilities. And their book value was $421.0 million, indicating a P/B of 1.3 as of Q1. But remember, their current Bitcoin stash has appreciated by roughly $142.4 million since Q1, implying an “updated” book value of $563.4 million. So their actual P/B is likely closer to 0.9. For comparison, their sector’s median P/B is noticeably higher at 3.3, so right from the get-go, NXTT might seem slightly cheap. Source: NXTT’s 10-Q Report. Q1 2025. Moreover, looking at the rest of their financials, NXTT is much closer to a company that just holds Bitcoin. In that sense, I think Bitcoin ETFs and the Bitcoin valuation itself are probably a better valuation metric for NXTT. So, NXTT’s Bitcoin holdings do suggest it’s roughly fairly valued. However, the reality is that NXTT’s latest Q1 showed they’re also paying G&A expenses to run this operation. In essence, I think we can consider those G&D expenses as “fees” for holding the Bitcoin for investors (at least until NXTT has actual revenues, if ever). In that sense, NXTT recorded Q1 G&A expenses of $449.9 thousand. If we annualize that figure, it indicates $1.8 million in G&A expenses. And if we compare that to my estimate of their Bitcoin “AUM” of $624.1 million, it implies an “expense ratio” of 0.29%. This expense ratio is also slightly higher than most straight-up Bitcoin ETFs , but not by a wide margin, either. As a side note, the good news is that NXTT holds so much Bitcoin that it effectively has more than enough ""cash"" runway for the foreseeable future. Source: Seeking Alpha. Plus, remember that we also take on additional risks on NXTT compared to such Bitcoin ETFs. NXTT could (in theory) raise those G&A expenses at its discretion. Similarly, they could cash in those gains and reinvest them aggressively into their AI projects, which could destroy shareholder value relative to simply holding Bitcoin. And lastly, the price of Bitcoin itself has been historically very volatile. I also find their lack of a coherent strategic vision very confusing. If you go to their website, they claim to be focused on SaaS, Blockchain, AI, Digital Assets, and even New Energy. These factors, coupled with a lack of concrete catalysts, make NXTT a very unremarkable (and potentially dubious) investment proposition in my opinion. Conclusion: Pass On This Bitcoin Play Overall, NXTT has a peculiar corporate history that has somehow evolved into a pure play on Bitcoin. While this may have been a revolutionary story before Bitcoin ETFs were approved, today it’s not as impressive. On top of that, they have interesting AI ambitions, but in practice, none of it has materialized so far. So, it’s unclear to me why anyone would take on higher risks than simply holding Bitcoin to potentially make the same gains as they would with Bitcoin alone. At the same time, I have to admit that NXTT doesn’t seem wildly overvalued or undervalued, either. Hence, I think the stock looks like a “Hold” at these levels.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4795623-next-technology-holding-a-confusing-bet-on-bitcoin-with-ai-promises?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING","BTC-USD|NXTT",cryptocompare

The purchase follows a series of convertible bond issuances totaling over 18 million euros, subscribed by UTXO Management, Moonlight Capital, Ludovic Chechin-Laurans and asset manager TOBAM. It also converted share warrants into nearly 3 million ordinary shares, raising another 1.6 million euros for bitcoin purchases. The company said it achieved a 1,173% BTC yield so far this year. The metric is defined as the ratio of total BTC held to fully diluted shares outstanding. Several companies use the term to measure how accretive their bitcoin acquisition strategy is, though they may track the yield in different ways. Even so, The Blockchain Group’s figure stands out. Strategy (MSTR), the world’s largest corporate holder of bitcoin, reported a 19.1% BTC yield year-to-date while Metaplanet (3350) reported 266.07% and Semler Scientific (SMLR) 26.7%. The Blockchain Group’s bitcoin was purchased through Swissquote Bank Europe and Banque Delubac, and is held in custody by Taurus, a Swiss digital asset infrastructure provider. The latest round of purchases brings the average cost basis of the firm’s bitcoin to about 90,000 euros per coin.

2025-06-18T08:32:09,"Which Levels Should Be Followed Next in Bitcoin? Analysis Company Announced, ""The Continuation of the Bull in Bitcoin Depends on This Level!"" He Said!","While Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a major rally last week, rising to $109,000, the tension between Israel and Iran overshadowed this. As selling pressure increases in Bitcoin, sellers are trying to take control. At this point, Bitfinex analysts said in a recent report that selling pressure from the Israel-Iran tensions has increased and Bitcoin is at risk of falling further. Despite the risk of a drop, analysts added that Bitcoin needs to hold above $102,000 for a potential recovery. At this point, analysts said that Bitcoin’s current situation resembles previous patterns that usually result in Bitcoin rallying shortly after aggressive sell-offs. “These sell-offs resemble past capitulations and often signal local bottoms. “If Bitcoin can hold the $102,000-$104,000 zone, it means that the selling pressure has been absorbed and the market is ready to recover.” Analysts also added that technical indicators suggest a short-term bottom between $102,000 and $104,000. That could potentially trigger a rally above $112,000, or new all-time highs, within six to eight weeks. Similar patterns have eventually led to rallies of 18-25% in Bitcoin, according to analysts. This Level Indicates a Bull-Bear Line in Bitcoin! Apart from Bitfinex analysts, analysis company Alphractal also pointed to $98,000 for Bitcoin. Alphractal noted that Bitcoin is likely to remain bullish as long as it remains above the key $98,300 support. However, breaking this threshold could tip BTC into a deeper correction. “As long as Bitcoin remains above the Realized Price of short-term investors (STH), we can still consider the market bullish. The bullish scenario only changes if BTC loses the $98k level, which could trigger a deeper decline.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-18T08:30:05,"Lazarus linked funds laundered through OTC brokers, says ZachXBT","Crypto investigator ZachXBT noted that illicit laundering networks and small OTC brokers have successfully laundered funds stolen in several recent hacks linked to the Lazarus Group. He estimates the Black U market on Tron is no less than $5-$10B and largely unattributed. The crypto trader also noted that many crypto exchanges sit and watch, collecting fees and doing nothing when more than 50% of the activity for their protocol comes from stolen funds. He believes that abuse in the crypto industry increased after politicians launched memecoins and numerous court cases were dropped, which further enabled the behavior. Crypto sector sees surge in illicit laundering ZachXBT believes there’s never been a worse time to do black hat (phishing, social engineering, robberies) versus gray hat hacks when the current environment is favorable. Hydra, the largest darknet marketplace in the world, previously facilitated over $5 billion in illegal transactions, primarily in BTC and Monero. Criminals used to buy and sell illicit goods, then laundered proceeds through crypto exchanges in jurisdictions with weak AML laws, privacy wallets, and OTC (over-the-counter) brokers. In 2016, hackers stole nearly 120K Bitcoin (worth $4.5 billion today) from the Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange. The funds were moved across multiple wallets and laundered through various methods over several years, including chain hopping, crypto mixers, P2P platforms, and small VASPs. In March 2020, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned two Chinese nationals involved in laundering stolen crypto from a 2018 cyber attack against a cryptocurrency exchange. Tian Yinyin and Li Jiadong were sanctioned for laundering over $100 million in stolen funds linked to Lazarus Group. “The North Korean regime has continued its widespread campaign of extensive cyber-attacks on financial institutions to steal funds. The United States will continue to protect the global financial system by holding accountable those who help North Korea engage in cyber-crime.” – Steven Mnuchin , Former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Tom Robinson, co-founder of crypto investigator Elliptic, argued that North Korea is the best at laundering digital assets out of all criminal actors involved in cryptocurrency. Dorit Dor from the cyber security company Check Point said North Korea managed to create a successful industry for hacking and laundering through its closed system and closed economy. He also believes that a big problem is that not all crypto companies are as willing to help as others. In February, the group hacked one of ByBit’s suppliers to secretly alter the digital wallet address for a transfer of 401,000 Ethereum. Crypto exchange eXch was accused by ByBit and others of not stopping criminals from cashing out more than $90 million through the platform. Ari Redbord, global head of policy at TRM Labs, said that what sets the group’s ByBit hack apart is the pace of post-hack laundering. Redbord revealed that within two days of the attack, the group funneled $160 million through illicit channels. He also argued that the shift raised alarming questions about whether North Korea expanded its laundering capacity because criminal financial networks have never moved that quickly to process funds. DOJ files civil forfeiture complaint against North Korean government On June 5, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil forfeiture complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, targeting over $7.7M in digital assets, NFTs , and cryptocurrency linked to a global laundering scheme directed by North Korea. The complaint revealed that the assets represent the proceeds of wire fraud and money laundering offenses conducted by North Korean nationals acting under the direction of the Foreign Trade Bank and Ministry of Defense. The department noted that the action focused on deploying North Korean IT workers abroad — primarily in China, Russia, and UAE — who used falsified identities to gain employment at U.S. and foreign tech firms. According to the civil complaint, payments made to the individuals, often in USDC and USDT, were allegedly routed through laundering networks and ultimately transferred to wallets controlled by sanctioned Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) entities.

2025-06-18T08:06:47,"BTC to $200K? BlackRock, Saylor bet big but can MUTM outpace it in 2025?","Bitcoin (BTC) is showing slight intraday gains on renewed institutional interest. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has amassed roughly 667,000 BTC, underscoring its ambition to dominate the crypto asset management market. While Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy’s vocal Bitcoin advocate, is reinforcing his bullish stance by adding more assets to the company’s balance sheet. At the same time, daring investors are also eyeing what crypto to buy now in the altcoin market, particularly Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a low-cost DeFi token poised for a breakout. Mutuum Finance, priced at just $0.03 during its presale, has already surged 200%, positioning itself as one of the most talked-about new crypto tokens this quarter. The project has gained more than 12,100 investors who have contributed $10.7 million during the ongoing presale. Investors taking part in the Mutuum Finance Phase 5 presale will see a 100% ROI when it launches at $0.06. Bitcoin consolidates near $106K as institutional support grows Bitcoin (BTC) trades at 105,943 without any drastic changes even though the volatility of general markets has increased significantly. Institutional demand is high and with the Blackrock iShares BTC Trust currently in possession of more than 667,000 BTC and the Strategy previously known as MicroStrategy, still buying its way towards being the largest corporate holder. The value of BTC could over the next few days be anywhere between the values of $106,000 and $112,000, with long-term predictions of $200,000. Bitcoin still has one of the best positions in cryptocurrencies due to constant demand and an increase in ETF flows. In the meanwhile, newer projects such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are attracting high-reward opportunities as altcoins in the market. Reimagining DeFi lending with a dual-model powerhouse Mutuum Finance is redefining decentralized lending by offering users complete control over their assets while generating passive income through flexible, secure lending mechanisms. By allowing borrowers to secure loans with multiple overcollateralized assets and enabling lenders to earn yields, the platform creates a seamless and trustless financial experience. Mutuum Finance is a strong dual-lending system that is a mixture of the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) concept. P2C mechanism uses smart contracts in controlling lending pools with dynamic interest rates that can adjust to daily changes in the market to offer predictable returns and financial stability of capital. In the P2P model, the middle man is removed and the lenders and the borrowers can transact directly. This gives it a specific and most suitable application in volatile assets such as meme coins accordingly; the user enjoys the advantage of the utilization of actual decentralization in addition to the greatest flexibility. Mutuum Finance presale enters phase 5 Mutuum Finance presale is currently in the fifth stage when an increasing number of investors have developed confidence. The project has already collected the funds of more than $10.7 million and gained more than 12100 token holders. As opposed to speculative meme coins, Mutuum Finance provides a scalable solution to the DeFi market, with its working product and real-life application, thus making a long-term solution and one with robust fundamentals and roadmap. USD-pegged stablecoin In a move to boost its DeFi platform, Mutuum Finance is introducing a fully collateralised USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum soon. Employing a system that keeps it pegged in wild markets, the stablecoin does not suffer the losses that have hounded algorithmic counterparts. Its organizational structure guarantees uniform price and stable marketability at retailers and institution levels. Adding to its credibility, Mutuum Finance has completed a full audit by CertiK, one of the blockchain industry’s most respected security firms. This certification underscores the platform’s commitment to transparency, reliability, and investor trust. Early investors benefit as community grows The project is also conducting a $100,000 giveaway where 10 people will be getting a lump sum of $10,000 MUTM tokens. It is a strong motivator not only to the whole crypto community but also those who will support the project at early stages. Bitcoin aims for $200K but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the altcoin to watch.

2025-06-18T08:01:04,"Iranian Crypto Exchange Nobitex Hacked for Nearly $82M by Suspected Israeli Group","Iranian crypto exchange Nobitex has been hacked for nearly $82 million by Israel-linked hacking activist group Gonjeshke Darande. The group said in an X post: “After Bank Sepah, it was Nobitex's turn,” referencing their Tuesday cyberattack on Iran’s state-owned lender . They warned that Nobitex’s internal data and source code would be released within a day, and any assets left on the exchange would be “at risk.” On-chain sleuth ZachXBT flagged suspicious outflows totaling $81.7 million in Tron's TRX TRX, bitcoin BTC, dogecoin DOGE and other tokens in his Telegram channel on Wednesday. The stolen funds were traced to a wallet using a provocative vanity address: TKFuckiRGCTerroristsNoBiTEXy2r7mNX. Estimates of funds stolen was later updated to over $82 million, with funds stolen across Bitcoin, Dogecoin and EVM chains from addresses including ""0xffFFfFFffFFffFfFffFFfFfFfFFFFfFfFFFFDead,"" ""1FuckiRGCTerroristsNoBiTEXXXaAovLX,"" and ""DFuckiRGCTerroristsNoBiTEXXXWLW65t."" The group called Nobitex a “core part of the regime’s terror financing network,” accusing it of helping Iran evade international sanctions by enabling crypto-based payments. Nobitex, Iran’s largest exchange, confirmed the attack in an X post but did not mention or confirm stolen funds. At the time of writing, it is unclear what attack method was used by Gonjeshke Darande to conduct the exploit. The hack comes amid a flurry of cyber and physical attacks between Iran and Israel. Gonjeshke Darande, believed by cybersecurity analysts to have ties to Israeli intelligence , has previously claimed responsibility for coordinated infrastructure attacks on Iranian steel factories and gas stations. With the source code leak looming, Nobitex now faces not only financial loss but a full-blown credibility crisis — and users who haven’t yet moved funds may stand to lose everything, per the hacking group’s followup threats.

2025-06-18T08:00:51,"Bitcoin NVT Enters Reversal Zone: BTC Dangerously Overvalued?","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Golden Cross has surged into a zone that has historically signaled overpriced conditions for the asset. Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Has Crossed Above 2.2 In a new post on X, CryptoQuant author Darkfrost has talked about the latest trend in the NVT Golden Cross of Bitcoin. The NVT Golden Cross is an indicator based on another metric known as the NVT Ratio. The NVT Ratio keeps track of the ratio between the BTC market cap and transaction volume. The idea behind the indicator is that the ability to transact coins (as gauged by the transaction volume) could be considered as a reflection of the asset’s ‘fair value.’ Related Reading: XRP Bullish Signal: Shark & Whale Wallets Set New All-Time High Thus, through the comparison of the cryptocurrency’s current value (that is, the market cap) with this fair value, the metric can tell us about whether the asset is overvalued or undervalued. When the value of the metric is high, it means the market cap is high compared to the transaction volume. Such a trend could imply BTC may be becoming overheated. On the other hand, the indicator being low could suggest room for the coin to grow relative to its volume. Now, the NVT Golden Cross, the actual metric of relevance here, is a signaling indicator like the Bollinger bands for the NVT Ratio that aims to locate tops and bottoms in its value. The NVT Golden Cross does so by comparing the short-term trend (represented by the 10-day MA) with the long-term one (30-day MA). Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the metric over the last couple of years. As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross has recently registered a sharp uptick and entered into the region above the 2.2 mark (highlighted in red). This zone is where the cryptocurrency’s market cap has historically outpaced the transaction volume to a degree that a reversion to the mean has tended to occur. In other words, it’s where price corrections to the downside have taken place for the asset. Related Reading: Stablecoin Exchange Inflows Plummet $61 Billion—Warning Sign For Bitcoin? Though, it’s visible from the chart that not every top in the NVT Golden Cross inside this territory coincides with a price top. And in many instances that it does, the decline in the asset isn’t to some major degree. So far since the signal has appeared, however, the asset has indeed been going down, a potential sign that the same reversion effect may be in play once more. It now remains to be seen whether downside will be limited, or if this will be one of those instances where the signal was followed by an extended drawdown. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $103,700, down almost 5% in the last seven days.

2025-06-18T08:00:38,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Massive Rally Potential After Correction","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Prediction: Massive Rally Potential After Correction The cryptocurrency market is always on the move, and recently, Bitcoin (BTC) saw a dip, sliding below the $104,000 mark. This movement occurred just ahead of a key decision from the U.S. Federal Reserve regarding interest rates, highlighting how traditional financial events can sometimes influence the digital asset space. But could this correction actually be setting the stage for something bigger? Many analysts are suggesting this recent price action might be a crucial setup for a significant Bitcoin rally . Decoding the Latest BTC Price Analysis Looking closely at the charts, BTC price analysis reveals that the dip found potential support right in the zone between $102,000 and $104,000. This area is significant for a couple of reasons: Historical Resistance Turned Support: This price range previously acted as a strong resistance level. When a resistance level is broken decisively, it often turns into a support level on subsequent pullbacks. The market seems to be testing this theory now. Compressing Bollinger Bands: Technical indicators like the Bollinger Bands are showing compression. This often signals a period of low volatility that precedes a significant price move. The tighter the bands, the more explosive the potential breakout can be. These technical signals, combined with the price holding within this key zone, suggest that a short-term bottom could be forming. This is a critical observation for anyone following Crypto market analysis . What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Price Prediction? Based on these technical observations and historical market behavior, analysts are painting an optimistic picture for the near future. The prevailing Bitcoin price prediction suggests that if the $102,000-$104,000 zone holds as support, Bitcoin could be poised for a substantial upward move. Past market cycles have shown instances where similar technical setups led to rallies in the range of 18% to 25%. Applying this historical pattern to the current levels, a rally of this magnitude from the $103,000 area could potentially push Bitcoin towards the $120,000 to $129,000 range. Is a $130,000 BTC Price Target Realistic by End of Q2? According to reports, including one by Cointelegraph, analysts are specifically eyeing a potential target of around $130,000. This target aligns with the upper end of the 18-25% rally projection and is being discussed as a possibility by the end of the second quarter (Q2). This timeframe suggests a potential move over the next six to eight weeks, potentially leading to new all-time highs. However, achieving this ambitious target hinges on one crucial condition: Bitcoin must maintain its position above a key support level. The level to watch closely is $98,300. A sustained break below this price point could invalidate the bullish outlook and suggest further downside is possible. Understanding Bitcoin Technical Analysis For those new to trading or investing, Bitcoin technical analysis involves studying charts and using statistical indicators to predict future price movements. The reference to Bollinger Bands is a prime example. These bands measure market volatility and can help identify potential price squeezes (like the current one) that often lead to significant breakouts. Understanding these technical tools is vital for interpreting the market’s signals. While no indicator is foolproof, using them in conjunction with historical data provides valuable insights into potential price trajectories and key levels to monitor. Key Takeaways for Investors Here are some actionable insights derived from the current market outlook: Monitor Key Support: The $102,000-$104,000 zone is the immediate area to watch for confirmation of a short-term bottom. The more critical level for the overall bullish thesis is $98,300. Potential Upside: A successful hold of support could pave the way for an 18-25% rally, potentially targeting $130,000. Timeframe: This potential rally is anticipated to unfold over the next 6-8 weeks, aiming for the end of Q2. Volatility Ahead: The compressing Bollinger Bands suggest increased volatility is likely coming soon, which could fuel the predicted rally or lead to a breakdown if support fails. Concluding Thoughts: Is the Stage Set for a Massive Bitcoin Rally? While the recent dip below $104,000 might have caused some concern, technical indicators and historical patterns are suggesting this correction could be a necessary step before a significant move higher. Analysts are pointing towards a potential 18-25% Bitcoin rally , which could see BTC challenging or surpassing previous all-time highs and potentially reaching $130,000 by the end of Q2. As always, the market remains dynamic, and maintaining position above key support levels, particularly $98,300, is paramount for this bullish scenario to play out. Investors should stay informed and watch these levels closely. To learn more about the latest Crypto market analysis trends, explore our article on key developments shaping Bitcoin price action.

His statement came after growing chatter about the overlap between politics and crypto. He called Justin Sun “a great friend and an icon in the crypto space,” yet he insists he has no “public involvement” in the merger. Trump Family Crypto Ties Eric Trump and his brother, Donald Trump Jr., both sit on the Dominari Securities advisory board. Based on reports, US President Donald Trump has pulled in $57 million from his NFTs and the launch of the TRUMP token earlier this year. . @tier10k I’m the biggest fan of Tron and love @justinsuntron – he is a great friend and an icon in the crypto space.

These connections have some observers wondering if family name and political clout are being used to open doors in crypto. Reverse Merger Details Dominari Securities is handling a $210 million stock offering linked to Tron’s reverse merger with SRM Entertainment. SRM announced it had secured a $100 million equity investment from an unnamed private backer on the same day it revealed plans to rename itself Tron Inc. This move lets Tron skip a traditional IPO and list instantly on Nasdaq by using SRM’s existing status. The new company will hold and invest in crypto, with TRX tokens lining its treasury. Questions About Influence The fact that Dominari’s offices are in Trump Tower adds another layer to the story. People are asking if political ties could tilt the scales behind closed doors. Based on reports, many feel Eric Trump’s denial is careful wording meant to keep him outside the formal spotlight while still allowing private gains. There is no public record showing him in the deal’s filings, but his role on the advisory board makes it hard to ignore him completely. Justin Sun’s Strategy Justin Sun has been working his own angles. He joined a private crypto dinner hosted by US President Donald Trump. He also bought a $75 million stake in World Liberty Financial in 2024, which reportedly led the SEC to pause its probe into him and the Tron Foundation.

2025-06-18T07:59:43,"EIGEN displays resilience as Eigen Labs unveils EigenCloud to enrich blockchain verifiability","Crypto projects continue to build as digital assets ignore the Iran-Israel war, with Bitcoin holding above $105K. Eigen Labs confirmed releasing the EigenCloud platform, designed to bring blockchain-grade verifiability to any off or on-chain applications. The launch comes after almost a year of development and research, and it aims to solve one of the top challenges in the crypto arena – making trust programmable and verifiable at scale. The native EIGEN coin powers the new platform. EigenCloud incorporates high-end developer tools, including EigenVerify, EigenCompute, and EigenDA. These will empower developers to create functional and provably correct applications. According to Eigen Labs CEO Sreeram Kannan: EigenCloud expands the programmability of crypto and makes virtually anything verifiable on-chain. It opens up the opportunity for developers to build highly ambitious products like disintermediated digital marketplaces, on-chain insurance, fully on-chain games, automated adjudication, powerful prediction markets, and verifiable AI. Eigen Labs’ native token, EIGEN, remained elevated following the announcement. It rallied more than 2% in the past day as top altcoins like XRP, SOL, and ADA lost up to 4%. Chart by Coinamrketcap a16z bets $70M to accelerate the verifiable infrastructure Meanwhile, EigenCloud’s alphas version goes live this week and coincides with a16z crypto buying EIGEN tokens worth $70 million. The massive purchase follows the company’s $100 million investment in early 2024, raising approximately $253 million in total. The massive funding reflects unwavering confidence in Eigen Labs. Messari @MessariCrypto · Follow a16z crypto has purchased $70M in EIGEN from the Eigen Foundation.They previously led Eigen’s $100M Series B in 2024.Eigen has raised $235M in total. 6:34 PM · Jun 17, 2025 83 Reply Copy link Read 25 replies A16z’s investment reflects increased interest in Eigen Layer’s token-centered financial model as EigenCloud guarantees fresh fees that can sustain staking incentives. Meanwhile, the new investment will accelerate EigenCloud’s commercialization and support AVSs (autonomous verifiable services) on EigenLayer. The transformative EigenCloud: why is it unique? Eigen Labs’ latest release brings something that the blockchain sector has highly sought after – using crypto-economic guarantees to verify off-chain computation, logic, and agreements. EigenCloud differs from traditional cloud services and other blockchain networks as it makes verifiability a built-in feature. Developers can leverage EigenVerify to remove misbehaving nodes and resolve disputes. Also, EigneCompute supports general-purpose tasks that still use layer1-like security guarantees. These features enable developers to build high-stake applications in industries that demand trust and truth, including media, artificial intelligence, medical records, and legal agreements. Introducing programmable trust in Ethereum re-staking EigenCloud integrates general-purpose computing, dispute resolution, and data availability into a single developer-centric platform. Developers can leverage cryptography technology to prove off-chain occurrences using trust guarantees traditionally earmarked for on-chain actions. Re-staking has gained traction in kick-starting decentralized infrastructures. Eigen layer allows Ethereum investors to re-stake their ETH tokens to access third-party services (AVSs). EigenCloud wants to take the game to another level, and with assets worth over $12 billion staked on EigenLayers and more than 200 AVSs, its momentum is undeniable. Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin stated: By bringing verifiability into the cloud-native developer experiences, Sreeram and Eigen Labs have been best-in-class leaders in expanding what’s possible on Ethereum and advancing the infrastructure for more trustworthy digital systems. These developments signals increased utility and demand for EIGEN, which could mean impressive growth in the coming times.

2025-06-18T07:50:35,"Solana ETF Hope: VanEck Registers with DTCC Signaling Future Spot SOL ETF Ambitions","BitcoinWorld Solana ETF Hope: VanEck Registers with DTCC Signaling Future Spot SOL ETF Ambitions Big news is circulating in the cryptocurrency investment world. Asset management giant VanEck has taken a notable step regarding a potential Solana ETF . According to reports, VanEck has registered a proposed spot Solana ETF with the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) under the ticker symbol “VSOL.” This development, while procedural, signals growing institutional interest in offering investment products tied directly to the price of Solana (SOL). What Does DTCC Registration Mean for a Spot Solana ETF? It is crucial to understand the significance, or lack thereof, of a DTCC registration in the context of launching a new financial product like a Spot Solana ETF . The DTCC is a critical piece of market infrastructure, providing clearing and settlement services for securities transactions. Registering a ticker symbol with the DTCC is a necessary administrative step in the process of potentially listing an ETF. It involves setting up the infrastructure for clearing and settling trades should the ETF eventually launch. However, this registration is entirely separate from the regulatory approval process required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States. Registering with the DTCC does not mean the ETF is approved for trading, nor does it guarantee that the SEC will eventually approve it for listing on an exchange. Think of it as getting the plumbing ready before the building permits are approved. Why is VanEck Pursuing a SOL ETF? VanEck is a prominent player in the asset management space with a history of being at the forefront of digital asset investment products. They were among the first to file for a Bitcoin ETF and have launched other crypto-related funds. Their move to register a VanEck Solana ETF suggests a belief in Solana’s potential as an investable asset class. Several factors likely contribute to this interest: Solana’s Market Position: Solana (SOL) has emerged as one of the largest and most widely adopted cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and ecosystem activity, particularly in areas like DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. Investor Demand: There is growing investor demand for regulated and easily accessible ways to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. A SOL ETF could cater to this demand. Diversification: For investors building a diversified digital asset portfolio, Solana represents a distinct blockchain architecture and ecosystem compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum, offering diversification potential. Following the Trend: The successful launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has opened the door and set a precedent for other single-asset crypto ETFs. Asset managers are now exploring the next potential candidates. Comparing the VanEck Solana ETF Effort to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs The path for a VanEck Solana ETF faces similar, and perhaps unique, hurdles compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. The SEC has historically been hesitant to approve spot crypto ETFs, citing concerns about market manipulation and investor protection. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 marked a significant shift, largely attributed to the market’s maturity and surveillance sharing agreements. Ethereum’s path to a spot ETF is currently being navigated, with the SEC approving 19b-4 filings for several Ethereum ETFs in May 2024, though S-1 registration statements still require approval before trading can begin. Solana, while large, is still considered by some regulators to be potentially more centralized or less seasoned than Bitcoin or Ethereum. A key factor for SEC approval is often whether the underlying asset’s market is deemed sufficiently resistant to manipulation and if there is a regulated market of significant size for the asset. For a Spot Solana ETF , the SEC will scrutinize the spot market for SOL and its correlation with regulated futures markets (if any exist or become significant). What are the Potential Benefits of a Spot SOL ETF? If a SOL ETF were to gain SEC approval and launch, it could offer several advantages for investors: Accessibility: ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges, making it easy for retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to Solana through standard brokerage accounts, without needing to set up crypto wallets or navigate complex exchanges. Regulation and Oversight: ETFs are regulated financial products, offering investors protections that may not be present when buying SOL directly on unregulated crypto platforms. Liquidity: ETFs typically offer high liquidity, allowing investors to buy and sell shares easily throughout the trading day. Familiarity: Many traditional investors are comfortable with the ETF structure, making it a more familiar and less intimidating way to invest in a novel asset like Solana. Challenges and the Road Ahead for a Crypto ETF Like Solana’s Despite the DTCC registration, the path to launching a Crypto ETF for Solana is fraught with challenges. The primary hurdle remains obtaining approval from the SEC. The SEC has not yet classified SOL definitively, and its regulatory stance on altcoins other than Bitcoin and Ethereum is less clear. Concerns about Solana’s network stability, past outages, and its token distribution could also be points of regulatory scrutiny. The timeline for potential SEC approval for a Spot Solana ETF is highly uncertain. It could take months or even years, depending on the SEC’s evolving stance on digital assets and specific concerns related to Solana. The process involves detailed filings, public comment periods, and extensive dialogue between the asset manager and the regulator. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors watching the development of a potential VanEck Solana ETF : Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from VanEck and the SEC regarding the filing status. Understand the Process: Recognize that DTCC registration is just one early administrative step and not an indicator of impending SEC approval. Assess Solana Itself: Any investment in a Solana ETF is fundamentally an investment in Solana. Understand the technology, ecosystem, risks, and market dynamics of SOL itself. Consider Alternatives (for now): Until a spot ETF is approved, investors can gain exposure to SOL through direct purchase on exchanges or potentially through regulated trusts or futures-based products if available, understanding the differences and risks involved with each method. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Crypto Investment VanEck’s DTCC registration for a proposed Solana ETF is a significant administrative step that highlights the growing institutional interest in bringing regulated investment products for major cryptocurrencies to market. While it does not guarantee SEC approval, it signals that asset managers are actively preparing for a future where a Spot Solana ETF could become a reality. The journey for a SOL ETF will likely be challenging, requiring navigation of regulatory hurdles and demonstrating market maturity to the satisfaction of the SEC. Nevertheless, this move by VanEck is a positive indicator for the broader acceptance and accessibility of Solana as an asset class, potentially paving the way for more diverse Crypto ETF offerings in the future.

While the rate is widely expected to stay the same, what Fed Chair Jerome Powell signals next could shake things up. Right now, Bitcoin’s stuck in a tight range, with short sellers crowding in and big holders quietly buying. With ETF flows looking weak and funding rates negative, most traders are playing it safe. But if Powell hints at cuts, it could trigger a sharp move higher, possibly pushing Bitcoin above $112K. A hawkish tone, on the other hand, might send it sliding back toward $100K. More than 10 central banks are set to announce decisions over the next three days: https://t.co/oLtv20lWd8 Federal Reserve – All Eyes on the Dot Plot No rate change is expected in June, but markets are focused… pic.twitter.com/HEjc4aSyzy — MacroMicro (@MacroMicroMe) June 18, 2025 All Eyes on the Dot Plot The Federal Reserve is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged in the 4.25%–4.50% range. The official decision is due Wednesday at 2 p.m. EDT, followed by Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference. However, this part is largely priced in. The real action lies in the Fed’s dot plot, a chart that shows where each policymaker sees interest rates heading in the coming months and years. If the dot plot signals fewer rate cuts than expected, it could reinforce the “higher for longer” narrative, strengthening the dollar and putting downward pressure on Bitcoin and other risk assets. Also Read : XRP Price Prediction After SEC ETF Delay Why Bitcoin Traders Care Bitcoin’s price has already cooled after touching highs above $100,000, and a hawkish Fed outlook could deepen that consolidation. XBTO, a crypto trading firm, says traders are bracing for volatility if the dot plot reflects less dovish expectations. According to analyst Matteo Greco from Fineqia, 2025 rate cut expectations have already been slashed from 100 basis points to just 50, and could dip even further to 25 basis points if global tensions continue. Also Read : U.S. Senate Overwhelmingly Supports Stablecoins’ GENIUS Act: Next to the House of Representatives Long-Term Impact Still Bullish Interestingly, a more aggressive Fed stance not only weighs on crypto in the short term, but it also adds long-term fuel. Higher rates increase U.S. debt servicing costs, worsening the fiscal outlook. That dynamic could enhance Bitcoin’s role as a hedge alongside gold, especially as inflation and global uncertainty remain in focus. For now, patience is the name of the game. Until the dot plot and Powell’s comments are revealed, crypto markets are likely to remain cautious, watching for any shift that could either freeze or fire up Bitcoin’s next move.

According to Marques, every time BTC broke above a major high in the past, a massive rally followed: In 2017, a breakout above $1,200 led to $20K price In 2020, a breakout above $20K led to $69K Now in 2024, a breakout above $69K is already in progress If we see a similar move to the 2020 cycle (a 418% jump), Bitcoin could reach around $288K this time. The chart attached by Marques backs up his view. The “cup” started forming in 2021 and rounded out through the 2022 bear market. The “handle” formed in early 2024 as Bitcoin briefly paused. This pattern points to a price target near $370K, which matches other predictions. Technical Indicator More Bullish Moreover, technical indicators like the monthly RSI show that Bitcoin still has lots of room to run. In past tops, RSI neared 90–98. Now, it’s only around 69 . That means we may still be early in this cycle. Also, a key tool called the TABI indicator shows we are still early in this expansion phase. All signs point toward one thing, Bitcoin may be on its way to a huge price discovery phase, with targets ranging from $197K to $370K.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoins-biggest-rally-upcoming-analyst-says-197k-370k-is-possible/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

2025-06-18T07:44:45,"Bitcoin Climbs Near All-Time High as Whale Wallets Return and Profit-Taking Dynamics Shift","This week, Bitcoin reached a peak of $108,947, bringing it nearer to its record high from just last month of $112,000. The market remains excited—if that’s the word—as it looks forward to a possible breakout, stirred up by some new data that seems to show the major holders of our favorite cryptocurrency behaving differently and, in a couple of cases, taking profits. After three months of a large-wallet count that could be called dismal, we now have some accumulation trends that look promising. As both short- and long-term players adjust their strategies, Bitcoin arrives at a critical juncture that may well fix its next significant move. Whales and Sharks Return After Months of Decline After a period of steady decline, interest in whale and shark wallets may be coming back. In the last four weeks, the Bitcoin network has added 622 new wallets that hold 10 or more BTC. This is the first significant uptick in the growth of large wallets since early 2024, and it seems to be signaling a renewed interest in peak players accumulating not-too-distant previous highs. Bitcoin has surged as high as $108,947 with traders continuing to await another challenge of last month's $112,000 all-time high. Interestingly, after 3 months straight of declining whale & shark numbers, the $BTC network has 622 more 10+ $BTC wallets in just under 4 weeks. pic.twitter.com/NpKkC5zsj9 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 16, 2025 The 10+ BTC wallets are thought to be held by either experienced market participants or by those with considerable wealth who have held BTC for a long time. If any of these groups is returning to accumulation, it might point to what the next Bitcoin price might be. And if we are using the assumption that the price might be based on the price these groups might value Bitcoin at, then we might also use this assumption in thinking about what price these wallets might push the Bitcoin price to next. The market has accordingly responded. The price of Bitcoin keeps on testing the upper resistance, and if the accumulation continues, it could provide the supply shock necessary to push it past $112,000 and into new territory. BlackRock holds 1 in every 31 Bitcoin to ever exist Launched in January 2024, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF has accumulated 666,842 $BTC , accounting for 3.18% of the total supply. Here are some of the largest $BTC holders and how their balances compare to the total… pic.twitter.com/zdJ1lQhnwi — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) June 16, 2025 Profit-Taking Rotates to Mid-Cycle Buyers In recent days, the behavior of profit-takers has undergone a striking change. For over 12 months, when we looked at who was realizing profits, we mostly saw long-term holders in the mix. However, this week brought a notable shift in that direction. Now, it seems to be dominated by short-term holders realizing profits. On June 16, holders of Bitcoin (BTC) for 6 to 12 months—mid-cycle holders—recorded $904 million in profits. This amount accounted for the second-highest daily realized gains we have seen this year. Unquestionably, the mid-cycle holders dominated the profit-taking we saw that day. In total, all holders with less than 12 months of coin age represented 83% of the day’s realized gains. Long-term holders, in contrast, realized just $324 million in profits on that same day, a steep decline from the $1.2 billion peak seen in late May. This shift indicates that newer market participants, especially those who entered the market in Q4 2024, are now actively distributing their positions. This mid-cycle market behavior has a common redistribution phase. As hands that are early to the market lock in their gains and step aside, more recent entrants tend to increase market influence and contribute to higher short-term volatility that makes the market judgment of value less reliable. These recent entrants, in turn, are trying to lock in their own market gains, which is pushing supply dynamics in the direction of broader shifts. BlackRock Now Controls 1 in Every 31 Bitcoin In the wake of retail profit-taking and changes in on-chain patterns, institutions are still building their Bitcoin stacks. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF has added 666,842 BTC since its January 2024 launch—3.18% of all Bitcoin in existence. One in every 31 BTC ever mined is now controlled by BlackRock. This figure has BlackRock at the top of the leaderboard as an institutional and governmental holder, surpassing even MicroStrategy’s much-publicized position of 582,000 BTC. The next competitors are holding: – United States government: 198,012 BTC – Fidelity: 196,264 BTC – China: 190,000 BTC BlackRock’s number is greater than all of these, though. Other significant holders are: Grayscale: 185,234 BTC Block.one (B1): 164,000 BTC Tether: 100,521 BTC United Kingdom: 61,245 BTC BitMEX: 52,020 BTC Institutional ownership is on the rise, reinforcing the notion that Bitcoin is increasingly being considered a macro asset. The supply of Bitcoin being absorbed by traditional financial firms continues apace. Their presence in the market tightens liquidity, making price discovery more sensitive to large inflows or outflows. Looking Ahead Bitcoin’s price momentum, together with whale reaccumulation and a shift in profit-taking among newer holders, signifies that the market is on the cusp of its next major move. The story of the last few months has been about how ETFs are bringing in not just retail, but institutional capital. And how big players like BlackRock are now amassing historic levels of BTC. This landscape is more than primed for further upside; it absolutely requires it as a logical next step. No matter if Bitcoin breaks past the $112,000 barrier or settles into its present range, one thing is beyond dispute: the market formation is shifting, and the forces altering it are larger, more deliberate, and more potent than ever.

2025-06-18T07:42:06,"Eyenovia to invest $50M in Hyperliquid tokens","Eyenovia, a publicly trading company, announced it would set aside $50M to buy HYPE tokens and stake them. The potential addition of crypto to the balance sheet aims to revive the company’s flagging shares. Eyenovia is joining the trend of buying altcoins as crypto reserves, in a bid to revive a weakening share price. The company chose HYPE for its reserves, setting aside $50M, a relatively small sum for a crypto treasury. The intention was to purchase HYPE and become a large-scale staker, while also rebranding the company. The main idea behind the altcoin treasuries aims to follow the example of Strategy, Metaplanet, Mara Holdings and other BTC treasury companies, whose shares benefitted from the purchases. However, in the case of Eyenovia, skepticism is accelerating on the viability of a treasury strategy. Altcoins remain more unreliable, with limited institutional demand and lower liquidity. Eyenovia itself is inviting warnings, as the company fired 50% of its staff in 2024, following a failed Stage III trial of myopia tech. Eyenovia, which was a digital ophthalmic tech company, will rebrand to Hyperion DeFi, and change its ticker to HYPD. The HYPE treasury will allow the buyer to become one of the top validators for Hyperchain, tapping into the growing trend of perpetual futures DEX trading. Following the announcement, HYPE still traded in its usual range of $40.52, after falling from a local peak of $45.12. HYPE has been one of the trending tokens, though still lagging in terms of mainstream adoption. The involvement of Eyenovia shows the hype for crypto as a booster for regular companies is accelerating. Eyenovia sold shares through PIPE The latest HYPE purchase will happen through inflows from accredited investors, in a private placement of equity (PIPE). The stock purchase agreement will offer convertible non-voting preferred stock, convertible into 154M of common stock. The conversion is subject to limitations set by company investors. The shares will be convertible at a price of $3.25, with the additional option to buy 30.8M common shares at $3.25. If all options are fulfilled, Eyenovia can raise up to $150M, with no guarantees about the sum or the size and value of crypto purchases. Eyenovia (EYEN) bounced from lows near $2, though still down over 86% from peak valuations. | Source: Google Finance In the short term, the price of EYEN climbed to $6.97, rising from lows of $2 in the past month. However, EYEN has erased over 86% of its value for the past 12 months, starting from above $106. Eyenovia is yet another company with no prior ties to crypto that has seen its shares rebound from lows following hints of crypto purchases. Universal Digital was one of the latest companies to announce a similar approach, though again through accumulating BTC. Classover Holdings also drew attention to itself, with a program to purchase SOL for $500M, financed through a recent stock offering. Other similar cases include DeFi Dev Corp with a $100M purchase, and SOL Strategies with a $67M treasury. The effect on stock prices in this case was disparate, with DeFi Dev Corp. rising to a six-month high, while SOL Strategies trading sideways close to its recent lows.

2025-06-18T07:35:24,"JPMorgan to pilot JPMD deposit token on Base blockchain","JPMorgan is set to test a new digital deposit token, JPMD, on Coinbase’s Base blockchain, a move that expands the bank’s blockchain footprint beyond internal systems. As reported by Bloomberg on June 17, the pilot will see a fixed amount of JPMD, backed one-for-one by U.S. dollar deposits, transferred from JPMorgan’s wallet to Coinbase. The token will initially be available to institutional clients for transactions, with plans to broaden access and support other currencies pending regulatory approval. The launch marks a significant evolution in JPMorgan’s use of blockchain technology. The bank already operates Kinexys, its in-house platform for digital payments and tokenized assets. Kinexys processes over $2 billion in daily payments and supports tokenized foreign exchange, derivatives, and data validation via its Liink network. The JPMD pilot extends this infrastructure to the public blockchain space for the first time. Unlike stablecoins, deposit tokens are issued by regulated banks and represent a direct claim on deposits. JPMorgan sees them as more secure and scalable for institutional use. You might also like: JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon claims he is not against crypto, but likens Bitcoin to smoking “From an institutional standpoint, deposit tokens are a superior alternative to stablecoins,” said Naveen Mallela, global co-head of Kinexys. He went on to say that deposit tokens might earn interest in the future and be eligible for deposit insurance, two features that are currently unavailable with the majority of stablecoins. The move follows a series of public blockchain milestones for JPMorgan in 2025. In May, the bank completed its first tokenized settlement on a public network, transferring U.S. Treasuries using Chainlink ( LINK ) and Ondo Finance ( ONDO ). In April, Kinexys partnered with Nacha’s Phixius to use blockchain for U.S. account validation in ACH payments. Most recently, JPMorgan began accepting crypto exchange-traded funds shares, including BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, as collateral for client loans. These changes demonstrate the bank’s increasing dedication to fusing traditional finance with blockchain. While JPMD is intended for wider use, starting with Coinbase and possibly branching out to retail-facing applications, Kinexys will still focus on large corporate flows. The pilot is expected to run for several months. Further developments will depend on regulatory feedback and market demand.

2025-06-18T07:30:46,"BBVA Advises Wealthy Clients: Secure Your Future with 7% Crypto Allocation","BitcoinWorld BBVA Advises Wealthy Clients: Secure Your Future with 7% Crypto Allocation In a significant move highlighting the increasing acceptance of digital assets within traditional finance, Spanish banking giant BBVA has reportedly begun advising its high-net-worth clients to consider allocating a portion of their investment portfolios to cryptocurrencies. This development, first reported by Reuters, signals a growing confidence among major financial institutions regarding the role of crypto in modern investment strategies. What is BBVA Recommending for High-Net-Worth Crypto Investors? According to reports, since September 2024, BBVA has been guiding its affluent clientele towards including cryptocurrencies in their investment mix. The specific recommendation involves allocating between 3% and 7% of a client’s total portfolio to digital assets. The exact percentage suggested depends primarily on the individual client’s risk appetite and overall financial goals. This tailored approach acknowledges the inherent volatility of the crypto market while recognizing its potential benefits for portfolio diversification. Initially, the focus of this BBVA crypto allocation advice has been on the two largest and most established cryptocurrencies by market capitalization: Bitcoin (BTC): Often referred to as ‘digital gold’, Bitcoin is the pioneer cryptocurrency and remains the dominant force in the market. Its limited supply and first-mover advantage make it a popular choice for institutional investors. Ethereum (ETH): The backbone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and NFTs, Ethereum’s network functionality and ongoing development make it another key player considered suitable for larger portfolios. The bank reportedly has plans to broaden the scope of its recommendations later this year, potentially including other cryptocurrencies as the market evolves and regulatory clarity improves. Why Are Banks Like BBVA Eyeing High-Net-Worth Crypto Allocations? This move by BBVA is not happening in a vacuum. It reflects several converging trends in the financial world: Client Demand: High-net-worth individuals are increasingly sophisticated investors. Many have expressed interest in cryptocurrencies and are seeking ways to gain exposure through trusted financial advisors rather than navigating the complexities of crypto exchanges themselves. Institutional Crypto Adoption: There’s a clear trend of larger financial players, from asset managers to banks, exploring or entering the crypto space. Offering crypto exposure is becoming a competitive necessity. Portfolio Diversification: Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, have historically shown low correlation with traditional asset classes like stocks and bonds. A small allocation can potentially enhance portfolio returns and reduce overall risk through diversification, a key principle in managing wealth for affluent clients. Potential for High Returns: While volatile, the crypto market has demonstrated the potential for significant returns, which can be attractive to investors looking to grow their wealth over the long term. By providing structured advice on high-net-worth crypto investments, BBVA aims to meet client demand, stay competitive, and potentially capture some of the growth opportunities presented by the digital asset class. Understanding the 3% to 7% Allocation Strategy The suggested range of 3% to 7% is crucial. It indicates a cautious yet meaningful approach. Here’s what that percentage range typically implies in portfolio management: Lower End (3%): Suitable for clients with moderate risk tolerance. It’s enough to provide some exposure to the potential upside of crypto and benefit from diversification effects, without exposing a large portion of the portfolio to significant volatility. Higher End (7%): Recommended for clients with a higher risk tolerance who are comfortable with potentially larger price swings in pursuit of higher returns. It still represents a minority stake in the overall portfolio, ensuring that the majority of assets remain in more traditional, stable investments. This range reflects the current understanding of crypto’s risk profile – high potential reward balanced by high volatility. It’s not a ‘get rich quick’ scheme being recommended, but rather a strategic inclusion for long-term portfolio health, aligning with principles of crypto portfolio diversification . Focusing on Bitcoin and Ethereum: A Calculated Start The decision to initially recommend only Bitcoin and Ethereum for Bitcoin Ethereum investment is a pragmatic one. These two assets offer several advantages from an institutional perspective: Liquidity: BTC and ETH are the most liquid cryptocurrencies, meaning they can be bought and sold in large volumes without significantly impacting their price. This is essential for managing larger portfolios. Market Cap & Stability (Relative): While volatile, they are the largest and most established crypto networks, with the longest track records and the most robust infrastructure and community support. Brand Recognition: They are the most well-known cryptocurrencies globally, making them more familiar and potentially less intimidating for traditional investors. Regulatory Scrutiny: While regulations are still evolving, BTC and ETH have been under the regulatory microscope longer than most altcoins, potentially offering slightly more clarity or predictability, although significant uncertainty remains. Starting with these two foundational assets allows BBVA and its clients to dip their toes into the crypto market with relatively more established options before exploring the potentially higher risks and complexities of smaller altcoins. Implications of Institutional Crypto Adoption BBVA’s move is a significant data point in the broader trend of institutional crypto adoption . When a major, established bank in a regulated jurisdiction begins actively advising wealthy clients on crypto allocation, it lends further legitimacy to the asset class. It suggests that crypto is increasingly seen not just as a speculative curiosity, but as a viable, albeit risky, component of a sophisticated investment portfolio. This trend could have several knock-on effects: Encourage other traditional financial institutions to follow suit. Increase the flow of significant capital into the crypto market. Potentially lead to the development of more regulated and accessible crypto investment products. Further integrate the crypto market with the traditional financial system. While challenges like regulatory uncertainty and market volatility persist, actions like BBVA’s demonstrate that the bridge between traditional finance and decentralized digital assets is being built, piece by piece. What Are the Risks and Considerations? It’s crucial to remember that investing in cryptocurrencies, even Bitcoin and Ethereum, carries significant risks. BBVA’s advice is specifically tailored for high-net-worth individuals who typically have greater financial capacity and risk tolerance. Key risks include: Volatility: Crypto prices can experience dramatic swings in short periods. Regulatory Changes: The regulatory landscape is still developing and can impact market dynamics significantly. Security Risks: While BBVA would likely facilitate investment through secure channels, the underlying assets and associated platforms can be targets for hacks or fraud. Market Sentiment: Prices can be heavily influenced by news, social media, and overall market psychology. Any investor considering crypto, regardless of wealth level, must conduct thorough research, understand the technology, and be prepared for the possibility of losing their investment. The 3-7% allocation recommended by BBVA reflects a strategy to manage these risks by limiting exposure relative to the total portfolio. Actionable Insights (Even If You’re Not High-Net-Worth) While BBVA’s specific advice is for a particular client segment, the news offers valuable insights for any investor interested in crypto: Diversification is Key: The principle of using a small allocation in a high-growth, potentially uncorrelated asset class for diversification applies universally. Focus on Established Assets: Starting with Bitcoin and Ethereum is often recommended for new entrants due to their liquidity and track record. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Determine how much volatility you can comfortably handle before investing. Long-Term Perspective: Institutional interest suggests a long-term view of crypto’s potential, rather than short-term speculation. Seek Professional Advice: While not everyone has access to BBVA’s wealth management, consulting with a financial advisor who understands digital assets is prudent. This news underscores that cryptocurrencies are increasingly being viewed through a serious investment lens by traditional financial experts. Summary: BBVA’s Bold Step in Crypto Allocation BBVA’s reported decision to advise high-net-worth clients on allocating 3-7% of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum marks a significant moment in the journey of institutional crypto adoption . Since September 2024, this Spanish banking giant has been guiding its wealthiest clients towards strategic exposure to digital assets, acknowledging crypto’s role in modern crypto portfolio diversification . This move is driven by increasing client demand and the growing recognition of Bitcoin and Ethereum’s potential within a balanced investment strategy. While the advice is tailored for those with significant financial resources and a suitable risk profile, it sends a clear signal to the broader market: cryptocurrencies are cementing their place as a legitimate, albeit volatile, asset class worth considering for investment, especially for those seeking exposure to potential high growth and diversification benefits. As BBVA plans to expand its crypto recommendations, this development highlights the ongoing convergence of traditional finance and the digital asset world, paving the way for greater integration and potentially more mainstream access to crypto investments in the future.

With the total market cap falling by 1.83% to $3.28 trillion and trading volumes dropping 7.63% to $123.25 billion, investor confidence appears shaken. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index currently stands at 48, marking a “Neutral” sentiment, suggesting that investors are indecisive and are confused between being cautious and holding confidence. This shift in sentiments is being shaped by broader macroeconomic and geopolitical triggers. Renewed Trump tariff threats, escalating tension in the Israel-Iran conflict, and fresh debates surrounding the US stablecoin regulation bill have added pressure to an already fragile market. Talking about market share, Bitcoin’s dominance now sits at 64%, while Ethereum holds 9.3%. The Altcoin Season Index reads just 23/100, confirming that altcoins are far from leading the market narrative. Liquidations Spike as Leverage Traders Face the Heat? According to CoinGlass , in the past 24 hours, over 105,830 traders were liquidated, wiping out a massive $319.18 million in positions. ETH traders suffered the most, with $100.83M in liquidations, followed by BTC with $82.89M. This indicates a major shift in trader sentiment, possibly due to surprise market moves and increased volatility. The largest individual liquidation occurred on Binance’s ETH/USDT pair, valued at $4.23M. These figures highlight the risks of high leverage in choppy market conditions and point to a growing disconnect between trader expectations and market direction. Fear & Greed Index Reflects Market Uncertainty The Fear & Greed Index has dipped from the Greed zone earlier this month, sliding to a neutral score of 48. This decline comes in tandem with Bitcoin’s price retracing from highs above $111k to lows near $105k over the past two weeks. Notably, the index briefly dipped below the neutral threshold around June 5. Further, coinciding with the sharpest drop in Bitcoin price, and again showed hesitation around June 13–15, reflecting investor hesitation to commit in either direction. Even though BTC volume remained relatively stable, the sentiment remained constrained in the Neutral zone.

Read our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 FAQs What does a Fear & Greed Index of 48 indicate?

Jesse Hill, 35, has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud and will be sentenced in September, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Nebraska. Hill and an unnamed individual who worked in the real estate industry partnered up in 2020 and attempted to secure loans from financial institutions throughout Nebraska and western Iowa. The loans were pursued in the name of the unnamed individual, who died in 2022, as well as that person’s business entities. The U.S. Attorney says Hill falsely claimed that the unnamed individual was a client of his and provided fake information about funds the individual held in his investment vehicles. “Hill would falsely represent that no other financial institution had a security interest in these fictitious accounts. Throughout the process of obtaining or attempting to obtain the loans, Hill and Individual 1 would engage with each financial institution to facilitate the loan process to include meeting with the financial institution in person, communicating by telephone, communicating by text message, or communicating by email. Hill knew that the representations being made to the financial institutions in order to obtain loans by Individual 1 and/or Individual 1’s entity were false and were being done with the intent to defraud.” Hill and the individual attempted to secure $45.65 million in loans from at least 19 different financial institutions. Most of the defrauded funds were directed into a failed investment scheme, as well as a property in Puerto Rico and an ownership stake in a private plane.

Market watcher Daan Crypto Trades noted that this resistance level remains a key area to watch, adding that “without a clean break above, it’s not the time to get excited just yet.” Nonetheless, the trader considers that the BTC is “setting up for a large move” as the cryptocurrency continues to hold its monthly range between $100,000 and $110,000. He asserted that this range will break “at some point in June,” as well as the current weekly high and low, which have “a very low probability of being held” in the coming days. Daan added that a break from these levels is highly possible in the next 1-2 weeks, likely leading to a big move in the direction of the break. Analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems highlighted the crypto market’s performance and investors’ concerns amid the war-related headlines, noting that Bitcoin reacted in a similar pattern during past geopolitical and crypto-related events. According to the analyst, global events’ uncertainty has led to mass liquidation and on-chain panic multiple times since 2020, leading to 30%-50% crashes. However, the market has recovered from these events after significant accumulation. Here’s the pattern: Big event (Black Swan). Panic headlines. Sharp BTC dump. Retail Panic sells. Smart money buys. Time passes. Bitcoin hits new highs. Based on this, Sjuul forecasted a strong Bitcoin pump and a new all-time high (ATH) once the current war tensions are over. BTC Holds Key Support Amid Pullback Meanwhile, analyst Rekt Capital emphasized that Bitcoin has been retesting its old range high as support for the past six weeks and showing stability around the $104,400 level during this period. According to the analyst, as long as BTC’s price Weekly Closes above this level, the candle wicks below it are “just noise” and it is positioned to transition into its Second Price Discovery Uptrend. He also pointed out that the cryptocurrency has only seen a less than 10% dip during the recent pullbacks. Moreover, these drop depths have also been diminishing, with the first rejection producing a 7.72% drop and the second dip being 5.79% deep, while the current rejection has seen a 4.5% retrace so far. Rekt Capital considers the strongest support to be between the $102,000-$104,000 area, and the final level to break is the range high resistance of $108,890.

2025-06-18T06:32:15,"Top 5 Large-Cap Coins That Outperformed the Crypto Market in June","The post Top 5 Large-Cap Coins That Outperformed the Crypto Market in June appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News While most of the crypto market has been dragging its feet in mid-June, a few surprising names have managed to stand tall. As Bitcoin cools off after hitting its $112K high last month, many altcoins have followed the usual pattern, dipping when Bitcoin slows. But while the market looked quiet, these top 5 large-cap coins surprised everyone with solid 30-day gains. Let’s have a closer look at it! 1. Newton (AB) Newton is a DeFi token used for lending and trading. It has gone up by more than 115% in the last 30 days . People are talking about it more, but they’re still unsure if the price will go much higher. That’s a good sign, too much hype often causes a drop. 2. SPX6900 (SPX) This is a meme coin that runs on Ethereum and Solana had a great run, up 97% over the last month. Although it recently had a small dip, traders believe it could bounce back again soon. Surprisingly, the coin hasn’t drawn as much hype as you’d expect from a meme token. 3. WhiteBIT Token (WBT) WBT is the native coin of Europe’s major crypto exchange, WhiteBIT. It saw a strong 61% rise just in the past week, making it one of the biggest gainers among top market cap coins. As of now, WBT coin is trading around $48.26 , reflecting a drop of 6% seen in the last 24 hours, with a market cap hitting $4.17 billion. 4. Hyperliquid (HYPE) HYPE powers a decentralized trading platform. It’s already grown 4x since April and is up another 52% this month. There’s a lot of interest in this coin, but if the social buzz slows down a little, the price could rise even more. 5. WhiteRock (WHITE) WhiteRock focuses on turning real-world assets like stocks and property into crypto tokens. It gained 66% in 30 days, even after dropping from its peak. Many traders aren’t watching it right now, which could make it a hidden gem. Currently, it is trading around $0.00081 , reflecting a drop of 11% seen in the last 24 hours.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/uncategorized/top-5-large-cap-coins-that-outperformed-the-crypto-market-in-june/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Uncategorized",cryptocompare
2025-06-18T06:27:51,"Thailand Approves 5-Year Crypto Capital Gains Tax Break","On June 17, the Thai government approved in principle a tax exemption to promote the country as a Global Digital Asset Hub. Deputy Minister of Finance, Mr. Julapun Amornvivat, announced the measure, labelling it a move to increase investment, stimulate economic activity, and drive long-term growth. “This tax adjustment will enhance the growth of Thailand’s digital asset market, related businesses, and token-based fundraising.” Thailand Eases Taxes on Traders In a note shared with CryptoPotato , Thailand’s leading exchange Bitkub explained that the cabinet has approved the exemption of personal income tax on capital gains derived from the sales of digital assets effective from January 2025 through December 2029. Previously, capital gains on crypto asset sales were subject to personal income tax collected via a 15% withholding tax. Mr. Amornvivat also said that the Thai Revenue Department is currently working on implementing a Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF), “which enables the automatic exchange of digital asset information globally, further enhancing transaction transparency.” Several large exchanges, including Binance , KuCoin, and Upbit, have opened branches in Thailand recently. However, there is a caveat in that foreign investors residing in the Kingdom cannot open accounts with local crypto exchanges due to stringent KYC policies. In May, Thai finance regulators also announced the world’s first tokenized government bonds called G-tokens. The government plans to issue $150 million worth of tokens through an ICO portal in July to raise public funds and help cover its budget deficit. Also in May, Thailand’s SEC ordered a blockade of several exchanges, including Bybit, OKX, and CoinEx, citing unlicensed operations and money-laundering concerns. In late 2024, Thailand proposed a pilot scheme to allow tourists to spend Bitcoin on the holiday island of Phuket; however, nothing has materialized since. Using digital assets for payments has been outlawed by the central bank since 2022. Vietnam Regulations to Roll Out Vietnam also has ambitions to become a regional digital assets hub. On June 14, the National Assembly of Vietnam approved the Law on Digital Technology Industry, bringing crypto assets under regulatory oversight. The legislation, which takes effect in January 2026, categorizes cryptocurrency into two categories, and both use encryption or similar digital technologies for validation during creation, issuance, storage, or transfer. It lays the groundwork for broader digital innovation across the country, according to local media reports.

2025-06-18T06:22:00,"Crypto News: Bitcoin, Ethereum See $1.9B Inflows, Tron Set To Go Public In US, Remittix ICO Soars Towards $16M","As the global economic community grapples with the current Middle East conflict, the crypto market remains resilient, exceeding analysts’ expectations. Major altcoins are performing well too, with the Ethereum price staying above $2,500 and Tron currently earning share of crypto news coverage with the reported plans to go public after US regulators paused their probe into its founder, Justin Sun. Experts say the cash pouring into BTC and ETH funds, plus crypto’s rep as a go-to safety net, are big reasons it’s beating expectations right now. Crypto’s steady growth also spills to tokens still in presale, with Remittix topping $15.7 million in proceeds. Remittix: Putting a More Efficient Spin on Cross-Border Payments Remittix, with its RTX token, is currently heating the initial coin offering space with its revolutionary take on cross-border finance. Currently, users can count on fiat-to-fiat payments offered by legacy payments like Wise and Spribe, with an emerging market for crypto-to-crypto settlements with Coinbase. While these legacy platforms work, the services are limited and often costly, too. Remittix’s Pay API can change all that: with its smart contract built on the Ethereum chain, users and enterprises can enjoy crypto-to-fiat settlements. Users easily connect their wallets, fund it with crypto, and settle payments in over 100 fiat currencies. Since Remittix leverages blockchain technology, settlements are faster, of public record and 10-15% cheaper, with no hidden charges! Bitcoin Records $1.3 Billion Weekly Inflow, BTC Price Steadies Above $105k Source: CoinShares The broader crypto market continued to show some reliance amid growing uncertainties in the Middle East. In a Coin Shares report , digital asset investment products enjoyed $1.9 billion in inflows last week, its 9th consecutive positive inflow. Bitcoin led last week’s charge, with $1.3 billion worth of inflows, as Bitcoin price holds steady above $105k. iShares EFTs remain as the most prolific fund, with inflows of $1.497 billion, followed by Grayscale Investments, and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s spot ETF inflows were also substantial, with collected fees amounting to $242 million last June 13th. Ethereum Price Remains Strong At $2,500, Records Strong Inflows Source: CoinGecko Like Bitcoin, Ethereum also benefits from growing retail and institutional adoption, with robust inflows in recent weeks. In the same CoinShares report, Ethereum sustained its run with $538 million worth of inflows last week, its largest since February. ETH’s latest inflow run boosted its cumulative inflows to $2 billion or 14% of all assets under management. Last June 11th, the spot ETH ETFs collected over $240 million and there are certain days when it even topped Bitcoin’s take at around $164 million. Currently, Ethereum’s monthly product inflows are nearing $1 billion, backed by growing regulatory clarity and institutional interest. Justin Sun’s Tron Preparing to Go Public Source: CoinGecko Justin Sun’s Tron has formalized its plans to go public. Multiple reports suggest that Tron will go public through a reverse merger with SRM Entertainment. Once approved, the new venture will purchase and hold Tron tokens, similar to Strategy’s strategic plan. Interestingly, the deal is brokered by Dominari Securities, an NY-based investment bank with ties to the Trump family. TRX’s price reacted positively to the news, with the price surging by 5%. Currently, Tron’s price is hovering above $0.2700, +2.1% from the previous month. Can Remittix Outperform BTC, ETH and TRX in the Near-Term? Bitcoin and Ethereum are riding the wave of increasing institutional adoption and growing inflows into the funds. While BTC and ETH continue to attract interest and TRX is gunning for listing, Remittix’s (RTX) continues to heat up in presale. With a revolutionary take on cross-border payments, Remittix promises to flip PayFi’s script with better services, at no hidden costs. Also, RTX’s presale program boasts programmed price increases on each stage, giving early buyers a bigger ROI potential. Currently, the RTX token sells for $0.0781 and targets $0.0811 on its next price increase. Don’t miss your chance to buy RTX at a low price- buy your RTX tokens now and enjoy a bigger ROI potential!
