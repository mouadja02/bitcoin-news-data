2025-06-18T02:00:16,"France Taps Bitcoin Mining To Harness €80 Million In Excess Renewable Energy","France faces a familiar problem: it often makes more electricity than it can sell. According to energy researcher Raphaël Bloch, the country wasted about € 80 million worth of power in 2024. Now, a group of lawmakers wants to put that extra juice to work. They’ve filed Amendment No. 547 with the National Assembly to fold Bitcoin mining into the national energy plan. Flexible Mining To Soak Up Excess Energy Based on reports, Bitcoin rigs can start and stop in seconds. That makes them ideal for soaking up sudden slugs of power that would otherwise vanish. France gets more than 70% of its electricity from nuclear plants. Those reactors aren’t built to throttle down fast when demand dips. Mining farms could jump in, kick their computers on, and gobble up the surplus until the grid needs a breather again. Reviving Old Factories As New Hubs Lawmakers want to set up mining centers close to power stations. They’re even eyeing old industrial sites that fell idle when factories shut doors. Those locations already have the hookups and space. Bringing in miners could spark new jobs in areas that have faced decline. Plus, the heat from the machines wouldn’t go to waste. It could warm homes or feed local factories, cutting energy bills for nearby communities. France lost €80M in 2024 due to… excess electricity. It’s such a missed opportunity for Bitcoin mining. The French grid operator is already warning about potential challenges in 2025. This situation presents a compelling case for Bitcoin mining in France, for several key… — Raphaël Bloch (@Raph_Bloch) April 17, 2025 Balancing Climate Goals With Carbon Costs Critics warn that mining still uses a lot of power. Even though France’s grid is mostly low-carbon, it isn’t zero-carbon. Bringing in too many rigs might push authorities to keep aging reactors online longer or fire up backup gas plants during peak use. That would chip away at the climate targets the amendment is meant to support. Parliament will have to set clear limits on mining capacity and tie operations to real power surpluses only. A Global Shift In How Countries See Mining France isn’t alone. Belarus has launched a study on using Bitcoin farms to absorb extra energy. Pakistan has set aside 2,000 megawatts for Bitcoin and AI data centers. Texas, with its wind-heavy grid, has even hailed mining as a way to smooth out wild swings in power supply. Daniel Batten, a researcher in the field, says this kind of controllable demand could be exactly what grids around the world need to handle green but unpredictable sources like wind and solar.

The memecoin has been one of the worst performing cryptos over the past months as bull fail to push its price above critical levels. Related Reading: On-Chain Analyst Warns: Bitcoin Peak Expected, Altcoins Facing -95% Plunge At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price trades at $0.17, recording a 13% loss over the past seven days.

According to top analyst Eliz, the Dogecoin price is at risk of falling to a dangerous area if it fails to sustain its current price. This ‘alarm zone’ is sitting around $0.14, if bulls fail to defend this area, the DOGE is at risk of falling deeper into the $0.12 to $0.08 and revisit levels last seen in 2024. Dogecoin price heading for a critical area. Source: Eliz883 via X As seen in the image above, the analyst remains hopeful that the cryptocurrency might rebound if it hits the ‘alarm zone.’ If this scenario comes to fruition, the cryptocurrency might reclaim its current levels and rise slightly towards the $0.2 area. The bullish momentum might push DOGE to previous highs on low timeframes, thus entering the $0.20 to $0.24 range. However, traders should remain cautious and watch closely for the coming price action before taking any position. Altcoin Season Could Save the DOGE Price Chris Burniske, former lead crypto analyst at Ark Invest, believes the altcoin sector is displaying some strength despite the Bitcoin sell off. While the top cryptocurrency seems to be cooling off, Burniske claims that Ethereum and Solana remain relatively healthy.

2025-06-18T01:30:00,"GameStop Tanks 12% on New Debt Plan – Could Retail Investors Pivot to  Mutuum Finance (MUTM)?","GameStop shares recently took a massive double-digit loss after the company revealed it plans to issue $1.75 billion in convertible notes to raise funds for its Bitcoin (BTC) purchase strategy. The company also revealed its plans to pivot to trading cards. In May 2025, GameStop bought Bitcoin worth around $500 million, and it plans to continue with that strategy. GameStop is following the investment strategy of MicroStrategy, which now owns billions of dollars’ worth of BTC, making it the largest corporate crypto holder. The decision by GameStop to purchase more BTC shows the growing acceptance of crypto in investment circles. While it has led to some losses in the short term, it could pay off in the long term as has been with MicroStrategy. Disappointed by recent losses, GameStop investors have been looking for a way to grow their portfolio out of meme stocks. One of their strategies has been to purchase the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale tokens, which analysts’ forecast could rise 30x or more. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A Next-Gen DeFi Project Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been touted by analysts as the most innovative DeFi project of 2025. It offers massive earning opportunities for its users, while also supporting the long-term growth of MUTM tokens. On the Mutuum Finance protocol, users can participate as lenders or borrowers. Lenders will deposit their funds into the protocol for a chance to earn passive income via interest payments. The interest rate is dynamically set by the pool utilization rate. As the number of borrowers in a communal pool grows, so does the utilization rate, and thus the interest rate. This rising interest rate pushes borrowers to pay back their loans, while incentivizing more lenders to deposit their assets to benefit from the higher rates. The process leads to a self-balancing loop that ensures optimal capital utilization. To protect lenders assets in the pools, all loans will have to be overcollateralized. The actual level of collateralization will be set by protocol parameters. That will ensure the liquidators have enough of a moat in which to respond in case of price fluctuations. More stable assets that have low volatility, and high liquidity will have smaller overcollateralization requirements, due to their inherent stability. Additionally, the protocol will implement a reserve factor, which is a portion of the interest collected from borrowers. These funds will go into a common pool, and will be used to maintain the stability of the ecosystem. More stable assets like stablecoins will get a reserve factor of as low as 10%, while more volatile assets, like meme coins, will be assigned a reserve factor of up to 35%. Mutuum Finance will also vet all new tokens added to the platform. This will ensure that users are not exposed to dangers such as price manipulation, and infinite minting exploit. Overall, that will guarantee the stability and growth of the ecosystem in the long term. MUTM Token Presale Details Mutuum Finance is currently in phase 5 of the token presale. So far over $10.7 million has been raised from the ongoing presale. Tokens in the current phase of the presale are going for $0.03, a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035. The analysts are optimistic about the future of MUTM tokens, projecting that their price will go up by 2,550% when they go live. This optimistic forecast has been a major driver of the presale, which has seen over 38% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 sold barely two weeks after they launched. Based on the analysts’ forecast, a $2,100 investment in the presale at the current price of $0.03 could grow to $53,550. That is a massive opportunity to grow your crypto portfolio in the long term. Besides the gains in the initial phases of the token launch, analysts expect the token price to continue rising in the long term. A major reason for this rise will be the buy-back program which the team will launch. They will use protocol profits to support the price of MUTM tokens on the open market, which will boost their profile on major exchanges. With the tokens expected to list on several top-tier crypto exchanges, this could lead to a massive boost in participation numbers as traders try to capitalize on the opportunity for more gains. Bottom Line Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens are currently on sale for a 50% discount on the planned listing price of $0.06. At this price you stand to make double what those who wait until the tokens go live. This is a rare opportunity in the crypto sector to join a project while it is on the ground floor, and continue to grow your earning long after it goes live.

The securities regulatory agency requested the members of the public to comment on the proposed rule changes to list both spot ETFs in the coming four weeks. When Will the SEC Approve Spot Solana ETFs According to James Seyffart, a Bloomberg’s ETF analyst, the delay by the U.S. SEC on spot Solana and XRP ETFs on Tuesday was not a surprise. Furthermore, the agency has been postponing other altcoins spot ETF applications in the recent past. However, as Coinpedia reported , the U.S. SEC has actively engaged the fund managers seeking to offer spot Solana ETFs in the past two weeks. Consequently, the odds of spot Solana ETF approval before the end of the year have significantly risen. “I wouldn’t be completely shocked if we see approvals for Solana ETFs in the next month or so. But I also wouldn’t be surprised if we have to wait until the final deadline in October. Timeline is unknown,” Seyffart noted . Market Impact The continued delay on the final decision for the altcoins spot ETFs will further delay the highly anticipated 2025 altseason. Moreover, the traditional crypto cash rotation from Bitcoin to the altcoins was disrupted by the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in the United States last year. However, the U.S. SEC will eventually approve the spot Solana and XRP ETFs, especially after Canada approved its first spot SOL ETF. Additionally, the demand for Solana by institutional investors has significantly increased in the past year, led by SOL Strategies.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/u-s-sec-delays-decision-on-franklin-templetons-spot-xrp-and-solana-etfs-what-next/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|REGULATION|SOL|XRP","News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations",cryptocompare
2025-06-18T00:58:18,"BBVA reveals efforts to make its “wealth clients” embrace cryptocurrencies","Philippe Meyer, Head of Digital & Blockchain Solutions at BBVA Switzerland, disclosed at the DigiAssets conference in London that the bank’s private banking division advises wealthy clients to allocate 3% to 7% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, depending on their risk tolerance. The Spanish lender’s act of offering its wealthy clients the opportunity to invest up to 7% of their portfolio in cryptocurrencies is the latest evidence that some mainstream banks are starting to open up to a sector that was once dismissed due to its risks. However, regulators continue to caution about the dangers of cryptocurrencies, warning that investors should be prepared to lose all their money possibly. Earlier this year, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) reported that 95% of banks in the EU do not participate in crypto activities. BBVA’s reveals efforts to make its “wealth clients” embrace cryptocurrencies In a statement, Meyer mentioned that they began advising their private clients on Bitcoin in September of last year. Due to the riskier profile accompanying cryptocurrencies, he revealed that BBVA will allow the clients to invest as high as 7% of their portfolios in crypto. What has driven this sudden shift is that cryptocurrency prices have soared recently, and Bitcoin hit its highest record in May. That comes after a rebound from the lows recorded in 2022 as a clutch of major exchanges, including FTX, went under and left millions of investors out of pocket. They were aided in the recovery by support from US President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance. While private banks often facilitate crypto purchases at clients’ request, they still rarely go so far as to recommend investing in digital assets actively. Meyer mentioned at an event that BBVA was one of the first major global banks to recommend that wealthy clients invest in cryptocurrencies. He noted that the bank has fulfilled client requests to purchase them since 2021. BBVA advises clients to invest between 3-7% in Bitcoin and Ether, but Meyer indicated they plan to include more cryptocurrencies later this year. Meyer stated that clients have generally responded well to this advice and dismissed fears about the assets being too risky. “If you look at a balanced portfolio, adding 3% can really improve performance,” Meyer explained. Based on his argument, investing 3% does not involve taking a significant risk. ESMA raises concerns about the dangers associated with crypto Earlier, the European Union’s securities watchdog warned that issues in the cryptocurrency industry could threaten the stability of financial markets in the future as the sector expands and its links to more traditional financial markets deepen. This call for caution from the ESMA follows US economic policies that irritate global markets as US authorities struggle to remove barriers between the crypto and traditional banking sectors. In a speech to the European Parliament that was shared on the watchdog’s website, Natasha Cazenave, the executive director of ESMA, revealed that E U financial markets face significant pressure due to wider political and geopolitical events. Additionally, stock markets have been crashing since US President Donald Trump announced a blizzard of new tariffs. This also caused a significant drop in crypto prices. However, asset prices in various markets regained some of those losses. Following these concerns, Crypto-asset markets are still quite small. To address this, Cazenave mentioned that in today’s market conditions, even problems in these small markets can lead to wider issues in their financial system. She also noted that the risks to financial stability from crypto are not significant at this time. Still, ESMA raises alarms about the dangers of crypto and states that this sector requires ongoing careful observation.

2025-06-18T00:44:02,"Asia Morning Briefing: GENIUS Act Positions ETH at the Center of Tokenized Finance, Says Wall Street Veteran","Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins its trading day, ETH is trading above $2500 as the U.S. Senate passes the GENIUS Act with bipartisan support. While the Senate was busy passing the GENIUS Act, Vivek Raman, founder of Ethereum advocacy firm Etherealize, was even busier, making the rounds on Wall Street to explain why ETH is suddenly at the center of institutional finance. Of course, Ethereum is nothing new. It's almost a decade old. But finally, in its almost 10 years of existence, Wall Street is starting to pay attention, and they really want to talk about it. “It’s an amazing job… running around from bank to bank, buy side to buy side, telling them what Ethereum tokenization means, how L2s work, and why it all flows through ether,” he told CoinDesk during an interview in between meetings from the lobby of Wall Street's Brookfield Place. As founder of Etherealize, Raman leads the firm’s efforts to educate Wall Street on ETH as neutral collateral and to help institutions tokenize assets and build on Ethereum. Raman says that Ethereum’s core value proposition, its role as the settlement and collateral layer behind stablecoins and tokenized assets, is finally resonating with institutional investors. “Every action is powered by ether,” he said. “Eventually, it’s going to be viewed as just as pristine as bitcoin. It'll be the neutral asset for the whole ecosystem.” The turning point, Raman says, was regulatory clarity. “Ethereum’s potential hasn’t been allowed until now,” he said, pointing to the GENIUS Act and broader U.S. policy momentum. “For years we didn’t know if it was a security or a commodity."" That’s why, despite the headlines around the ETH ETF, Raman says the real unlock for Ethereum came from regulatory clarity, not a ticker symbol. “The ETH ETF cleared the way by signaling that ether is a commodity, but it still wasn’t explicit,” Raman said. “With clear market structure, the utility of Ethereum gets completely unleashed. Now ETH permeates everything: every tokenized asset transfer, every stablecoin transfer, every Layer 2, they all flow through ETH.” And while Circle’s IPO and the rise of tokenized treasuries have brought new visibility to the sector, Raman says savvy investors will want more than equity exposure to stablecoin brands. Circle may get the IPO, but Ethereum gets the flows,” he said. “ETH is what secures this whole ecosystem, and it’s the only neutral, non-censorable collateral that can route value between all these tokenized assets.” VanEck's Solana ETF Comes Closer to Listing with DTCC Entry VanEck's proposed Solana Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) has been listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) website under the ticker symbol VSOL, a procedural step that typically signals readiness for electronic clearing and settlement. VanEck’s DTCC listing comes amid growing institutional interest in Solana, following the blockbuster success of spot bitcoin and ether ETFs. However, just like with those ETFs, Canada has beaten the U.S. in the race to get listed. Four Canadian issuers, Purpose, Evolve, CI, and 3iQ, launched their Solana ETFs in April, following approval from the Ontario Securities Commission. OKX Continues European Expansion with Regulated Launch in Germany and Poland OKX has officially launched regulated crypto exchanges in Germany and Poland, marking a strategic expansion into two of Europe’s most active digital asset markets. The company now offers spot trading, staking, automated trading bots, and over 60 crypto-Euro pairs to users in both countries, supported by localized platforms with Euro onramps. ""Germany and Poland are key growth markets in the EU, and our license allows us to tailor our products and services to meet the specific needs of users in each country, delivering greater value, enhanced security, and more efficient access to customers,"" Erald Ghoos, CEO of OKX Europe, said in a release. In the release, OKX emphasized its regulatory positioning, highlighting its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) compliance and ongoing transparency efforts, including 31 consecutive months of Proof of Reserves reports. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin briefly dipped to $103,396 amid Israel-Iran tensions before rebounding on continued institutional ETF buying, with low exchange reserves amplifying volatility in a tight trading channel between $103,405 and $107,780. ETH: Ethereum traded within a wide range over 24 hours amid Middle East tensions, showing resilience by rebounding from a $2,460 support zone with strong volume, though it continues to face stiff resistance near $2,800. Gold: Gold remains rangebound below $3,400 as traders await Fed guidance, with geopolitical tensions, U.S. deficit concerns, and currency debasement risks supporting its long-term uptrend.

Bank of America sees gold going up to $4,000 an ounce over the next 12 months, a gain of more than 17% from the current level, reports Reuters. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs expects the precious metal to surge to $3,700 by the end of this year, lifted by strong demand from central banks. The firm also sees gold soaring to $4,000 by June 2026. Gold is trading at $3,395 at time of writing, up about 30% year-to-date. The precious metal is slightly down from the all-time high of $3,500 reached in April. Daniel Pavilonis, a senior market strategist at the brokerage firm RJO Futures, tells Reuters that escalating fears of a broader Middle East conflict are pushing gold prices higher. “Israel knocking out Iranian targets is causing a little bit of geopolitical scare in the market. Prices will stay elevated in the anticipation of what is to come, the retaliation by Iran.” On Friday, Israel fired airstrikes at Iran, killing a number of the Islamic Republic’s senior military personnel and destroying strategic military targets. The value of gold surged following the breakout of the conflict before giving up most of its gains on Monday.

2025-06-18T00:00:18,"Likely Value of 5,000 or 10,000 XRP If XRP Hits $1 Trillion Market Cap","A growing number of investors continue to explore XRP as a long-term investment option, especially as some analysts project the possibility of the cryptocurrency reaching a $1 trillion market capitalization. If this scenario plays out, holders of 5,000 or 10,000 XRP could realize notable returns. Market Overview and Current Price Action XRP has experienced a moderate price increase of just over 3% since the beginning of the week. Despite this upward movement, the asset continues to trade below the $2.20 price level, a threshold it has hovered near for several months without a clear breakout. The broader cryptocurrency market remains largely range-bound, influenced in part by geopolitical events, including heightened instability in the Middle East. This prolonged consolidation phase has limited XRP’s momentum, although some market observers remain optimistic about a potential rally. Historical comparisons to XRP’s significant performance in 2017 continue to fuel expectations of a similar pattern repeating. Forecasts Supporting a $1 Trillion Market Cap Several market analysts have recently expressed optimism about XRP’s long-term potential. Analyst EGRAG has pointed to technical indicators that, in their view, suggest a market structure capable of supporting a major valuation increase. Specifically, EGRAG referenced a chart pattern that they believe could eventually lead XRP to a market capitalization near $1 trillion. Other perspectives have emphasized the importance of utility and adoption. For example, Omni’s founder, Austin King, argued that XRP would need to significantly improve its presence in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector and strengthen interoperability to reach such a valuation. Similarly, a prior analysis from xAI’s Grok explored the level of capital inflow required for XRP to attain a $1 trillion market cap. In addition, XRP advocate Edoardo Farina has encouraged investors to accumulate between 5,000 and 10,000 XRP, emphasizing the rarity of such holdings. He noted that fewer than 4% of XRP wallets contain over 10,000 tokens, and described such a holding as increasingly difficult to achieve. Farina also asserted that many future success stories in the space may begin with bold moves to secure large XRP positions early. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Investment Implications for XRP Holders Should XRP reach the $1 trillion market capitalization milestone, it would join Bitcoin as the only cryptocurrency to do so. Using the current circulating supply of approximately 58.88 billion tokens, XRP’s price would need to rise to about $16.90 per coin to reach this valuation. Based on this projected price: An investor holding 5,000 XRP would see their portfolio valued at $84,500 An investor holding 10,000 XRP would have holdings worth $169,000 At the current market price of approximately $2.20, acquiring 5,000 XRP would require an investment of $10,950, while purchasing 10,000 XRP would cost about $21,900. This represents a potential gain of more than 670% if XRP reaches $16.90. While the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, the possibility of a $1 trillion valuation has become a frequent subject of analysis. Achieving such a milestone would require substantial progress in adoption, use cases, and investor confidence. However, if the necessary conditions align, long-term holders of XRP could see significant returns on their investment.

2025-06-17T23:30:48,"Top 4 Altcoins Showing Counter-Cycle Strength As Bitcoin Dominance Peaks","Bitcoin dominance is nearing a critical high, a level that typically signals a slowdown for altcoins. But in every cycle, there are exceptions, projects that move independently, refusing to follow the crowd. Right now, four altcoins are drawing attention for doing exactly that. While the broader market hesitates, Near Protocol (NEAR), Hyperliquid (HYPE), FloppyPepe (FPPE), and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) are showing unusual resilience. However, amidst these altcoins, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is turning heads with massive presale buzz, drawing meme coin believers chasing 35x to 100x gains. FloppyPepe (FPPE): Built To Perform When The Market Doesn’t The FloppyPepe (FPPE) altcoin is quickly gaining recognition as one of the most promising crypto plays for outsized gains. Early buyers have already taken advantage of the 80% bonus through the FLOPPY80 code, nearly doubling their holdings. The presale isn’t over yet; there’s still a brief window to get in at $0.00000035 before launch pricing jumps to $0.01. The boldest prediction? Analysts are floating a $1 target for FloppyPepe (FPPE) alongside the Bitcoin dominance, creating a staggering leap from its current level. FloppyPepe (FPPE) continues to rise alongside Near Protocol (NEAR), Fartcoin (FART), and Hyperliquid (HYPE) due to its ability to address gaps left by other altcoins. This gives it a unique edge in a crowded space. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Only Meme Coin Using AI And Scarcity For Real Gains Through its AI tools, Meme-o-Matic , FloppyX , and FloppyAI , FloppyPepe (FPPE) empowers users to instantly generate viral-ready memes, AI-driven video content, and real-time market insights, transforming it from a simple altcoin into an AI-powered platform that reinforces engagement and platform utility. In addition, Floppynomics gives FloppyPepe (FPPE) a unique counter-cycle strength as Bitcoin dominance surges. The altcoins are designed so that holders receive extra rewards from transactions, while the overall circulating supply gradually decreases. This built-in scarcity and reward structure favors early adopters, while the Solidproof audit guarantees security, making now a strategic time to accumulate before broader demand kicks in. Near Protocol (NEAR): Holding Steady While The Rest Look Shaky Near Protocol (NEAR) has recently stabilized between $2.22 and $2.30, recovering from a sharp 12.8% drop tied to broader war tensions. Despite the Bitcoin dominance peak, Near Protocol’s (NEAR) core metrics remain strong; 46 million monthly users place it as the second most-used Layer-1 protocol. As one crypto analyst recently put it, “ Grab Near Protocol (NEAR) while the price is still cheap. ” With this level of usage, Near Protocol (NEAR) remains one of the few altcoins showing strength where it matters. Hyperliquid (HYPE): A Rising Star With Price Action To Prove Hyperliquid (HYPE) recently surged to a new all-time high of $44.69, edging past its previous peak of $43.96. As Bitcoin dominance continues to rise, Hyperliquid (HYPE) is breaking away from the pack , showing rare counter-cycle strength. The Hyperliquid (HYPE) price rally points to rising transactional activity and deeper liquidity within the Hyperliquid (HYPE) ecosystem. Momentum indicators like MACD and RSI are also trending upward on the 4-hour chart, with some analysts now eyeing a potential push toward $100. Fartcoin (FART): Big Listing, Big Gains, Bigger Potential Fartcoin (FART) jumped nearly 40% in the past week and is now trading at $1.32 , following its Coinbase listing that went live on Thursday, a move known to attract fresh investor inflow. Amidst rising Bitcoin dominance, a Fartcoin (FART) is currently outperforming major meme coins , and with bullish technical signals and growing visibility, Fartcoin (FART) is quickly becoming a standout in the altcoin arena. Buy Now Or Regret Later: FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) 80% Bonus Is Almost Gone Near Protocol (NEAR), Hyperliquid (HYPE), FloppyPepe (FPPE), and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) are showing rare counter-trend strength as Bitcoin dominance reaches its peak. Meanwhile, FloppyPepe (FPPE), the new AI altcoin, stands out not just for its ultra-low entry price but also for strong backing from influential crypto voices and, notably, the ongoing Presale promo. Right now, early early buyers still have a rare chance to scoop up FloppyPepe (FPPE) at just $0.00000035 and get an instant 80% bonus using the promo code FLOPPY80 . But don’t get too comfortable; this offer could vanish before the next stage even kicks in. Miss it, and be ready to chase green candles.

2025-06-17T23:07:51,"Top crypto price predictions: Bitcoin, XRP, Solana","The ongoing Iran-Israel war has bolstered crude oil and gold prices while weighing on stocks worldwide. However, Bitcoin, often referred to as digital gold, has failed both as a safe haven anda FOMO asset. As is often the case, its underwhelming performance has spilled over to other crypto majors. Even so, its upside potential is significant. As the markets eye the ongoing conflicts, a recovery is still likely. Bitcoin price fails as a safe haven amid the geopolitical tensions The initial attack by Israeli forces on Iranian nuclear sites late last week yielded the expected moves; Brent crude oil price surged by about 7%, gold price rallied by 1.5%, and stocks dropped worldwide. Interestingly, Bitcoin, which is usually referred to as digital gold, failed to live up to its position as a safe haven. In fact, the leading cryptocurrency dropped to a one-week low on Friday; extending losses recorded in the previous two sessions. Like gold, Bitcoin’s tight supply boosts its status as a store of value. However, the rebound of the US dollar in the wake of the Israel-Iran conflict has capped its upward momentum. Even so, it bears high upside potential amid the persistent uncertainties. At a crypto fear & greed index of 50, the traders appear indecisive. However, a bullish undertone is observable. Data released by SoSoValue showed that US BTC spot ETFs had daily total net inflows of $412.20 million as of 16th June. With no outflows, the top 6 ETFs recorded inflows with BlackRock’s IBIT leading with inflows of $266.60 million. Besides, as highlighted by CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin’s trading volume rose by 25.87% over the past 24 hours. A surge in trading volume usually points to increased investor interest. BTC price chart | Source: TradingView In the short term, Bitcoin price is likely to trade within the range of between $106,309 and $101,370 as the markets continue to weigh in on the ongoing Iran-Israel conflict. Notably, the bullish golden-cross pattern that has been in place for close to two months now confirms a continuation of the uptrend. With the attraction of more buyers, the bulls will be looking to retest Monday’s high of $108,900. Bearish pattern shapes Ripple price path as XRP lawsuit drags on As the Ripple Labs – SEC lawsuit drags on and the broader crypto market remains in a neutral mode, Ripple price is still under pressure. A look at its daily chart shows the altcoin still trading below the descending trendline. At the time of press, the crypto major was trading below the 25 and 50-day EMAs that appear to be converging around $2.24. Amid the traders’ indecisiveness, the range between $2.10 and $2.27 is worth watching. Even with the possible recovery, it will likely face resistance at May’s level of $2.39.

2025-06-17T23:00:51,"XRP To End 7-Month Consolidation After 700% Surge – Is A Major Move Coming?","After months of sideways movement, XRP may finally be gearing up for a significant breakout. According to analysts, the popular altcoin saw a dramatic 700% surge earlier last year. Now, its price is positioned to exit a seven-month consolidation phase, which could set it up for its next bullish move. XRP Gets Ready For Major Bullish Move A recently published technical chart by market expert ‘Crypto Michael’ on X (formerly Twitter) reveals that XRP has been consolidating for seven months following a staggering 700% price rally, which was triggered by a breakout from a multi-year Symmetrical Triangle pattern. The chart, based on a 3-month candlestick, shows that XRP had been in a major price compression within the triangle pattern for seven years. Related Reading: XRP Price Still On Track For $1.5T Market Cap And 27% Crypto Market Dominance True to form, XRP finally broke above the upper trendline of the pennant in late 2024, igniting one of its most powerful quarterly rallies to date. This breakout led to a price surge of about 700%, pushing the cryptocurrency from around $0.6 to over $2. Since the dramatic breakout, XRP has entered a stabilization phase, trading sideways in what appears to be a healthy consolidation range. The chart highlights this consolidation area with a white circle, indicating a well-defined post-breakout phase. Notably, XRP’s $2.15 price at the time of the analysis is above prior resistance levels, suggesting that the cryptocurrency is maintaining strength while waiting for its next bullish catalyst. Crypto Michael points out that XRP’s consolidation is ending just as Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, approaches a critical juncture: the “8-year line.” This correlation suggests that a broader shift in market sentiment may be underway. Historically, leading altcoins like XRP have followed Bitcoin’s lead during broader market rallies. If BTC successfully breaks through this long-standing line, Crypto Michael believes it could serve as a macro trigger that ignites a fresh bullish move for XRP. Analyst Says The Altcoin Is Set To Explode Against BTC A fresh analysis by Egrag Crypto, a crypto analyst on X, suggests that the XRP/BTC pair could be on the edge of a major breakout. The pair has followed a consistent cycle for over a decade, with lows in 2015, 2017, 2020, and 2024—each succeeded by strong rallies. These lows align with a rising trendline, signaling possible long-term strength. Related Reading: XRP Bullish Structure Remains Bullish: Analyst Releases 3 New Targets Now, XRP/BTC is approaching a key resistance level that has blocked past rallies since 2015. This time, however, Egrag Crypto suggests that the setup looks different and slightly more favorable for a breakout. If the pair breaks above this multi-year ceiling, it could mark a major turning point, effectively leading XRP into an explosive bullish phase. The analyst’s chart outlines two potential paths: a green breakout zone if XRP pushes higher and a red rejection zone if it fails to break this key resistance again.

The Purpose XRP ETF (XRPP) received the green light from Canadian regulators this week to start offering access to XRP through these instruments and will hit the trading desks tomorrow. June 18th. TSX. Get ready. Announcing the Purpose XRP ETF, offering regulated, direct exposure to spot #XRP , the native token powering fast, low-cost cross-border payments Fund page: https://t.co/CfCEdbOUEp Press release: https://t.co/8v1FPkXSdU … pic.twitter.com/uzNgZyRpC3 — Purpose Investments (@PurposeInvest) June 16, 2025 In addition, the Evolve XRP ETF (XRP) will apparently start trading on June 18 as well. Both vehicles will offer exposure to the native asset of the ripple network in both Canadian dollars and United States dollars. This is a landmark moment for the asset management industry in this region as crypto ETFs are considered the next step to accelerate the adoption of digital assets by institutional investors and retail investors alike. The approval of an XRP ETF in Canada is a positive step that increases the odds of an upcoming nod from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to similar products whose applications have already been submitted. This favors a bullish XRP price prediction as additional liquidity will flow to the token as more of these investment vehicles are launched. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Could Hit $2.08 Before Its Next Leg Up Looking at the 4-hour chart, XRP has hit a key resistance at $2.33 that has apparently triggered a strong sell-off. The token seems to have entered a stage of consolidation amid the absence of catalysts that could drive its price either higher or lower. This week will likely be critical for the token’s performance as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting scheduled for Wednesday typically adds some volatility to the markets. For now, the near-term XRP price prediction could see the token hitting the $2.08 support as the market could go there to raise the necessary liquidity for its next leg up. Although hitting $1,000 seems unrealistic at the moment, increased adoption of altcoins like XRP by investors across the world will contribute to propelling the price of this cryptocurrency to uncharted territory. In this case, the next logical stop for the token would be its nearest all-time high like Bitcoin (BTC). For XRP, this means a push to the $3.5 level in the near term. Like XRP, the best crypto presales of the year like Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) offer significant upside potential amid their robust practical use cases. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) Opens Up Access to BTC’s DeFi Through a Solana-Powered L2 Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) is a layer-2 scaling protocol for the Bitcoin network that leverages the power, efficiency, and scalability of the Solana blockchain to make asset transfers within the Bitcoin network cheaper and faster. Through the use of smart contracts, this solution unlocks the huge potential of Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem and will also popularize the creation of meme coins in this ecosystem as it will be easier and cheaper to swap these tokens through DEXs built on Bitcoin Hyper. $HYPER will experience significant demand once the protocol is embraced by top wallets and exchanges. Hence, investors can position themselves favorably to reap the highest returns by buying this token at its discounted presale price of $0.011925. To buy $HYPER, simply head to the Bitcoin Hyper website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to invest.

In a note seen by Bloomberg , Goldman analysts led by David Kostin say they expect American households to directly purchase $425 billion worth of US equities this year. In doing so, households would trail only corporations, which the bank predicts will buy $675 billion, as the top sources of stock demand. Goldman partially bases the forecast on the concept that “there is no alternative” (TINA) to US markets. “TINA trade remains alive and well in US retirement accounts.” A separate group of Goldman analysts says that during the “liberation day” stock crash in early April, US households aggressively bought the dip, but have since turned into net sellers. However, that selling pressure has been offset by new institutional demand, according to the bank. “The resilience of household demand for equities is vital because households represent the largest ownership category of the US equity market… Households directly own 38% of the US equity market and control an even larger share including indirect ownership through funds.” Source: Goldman Sachs/Bloomberg The analysts added that Americans, on average, allocate 49% of their total financial assets to equities, which is the highest level on record and just above the previous high of 48% set in 2020. In comparison, people in the euro area only allocate 10% of their total assets to stocks, and just 13% in Japan.

2025-06-17T22:00:00,"Bitcoin (BTC) Slides Again – Is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Flashing a Buy Signal?","Following heightened tensions in the Middle East that have seen Israel and Iran take military action against each other, the price of Bitcoin slid after recently reaching $110,000. It is currently at around $105,000, with tensions causing massive liquidations across the crypto sector. In addition to the liquidation of long positions, trading volume for BTC rose to new highs as traders sold off massive amounts of BTC holdings. On-chain metrics show that Bitcoin is not due for a quick rebound and could stagnate at the $105,000 level for a while. Amid these rising tensions, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been flashing buy signals as Bitcoin (BTC) investors look for market opportunities elsewhere. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in the presale, where it has raised over $10.7 million so far. Participation levels have also risen quite high since the current phase of the presale began. The MUTM Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in the presale phase, where tokens are going for $0.03. At the current price, users are getting a 50% discount on the planned listing price of $0.06. The token presale has attracted around 12,100 buyers who have bought over $10.7 million worth of tokens. The current presale price is a 200% increase from the $0.01 listing price, which has not had an impact on the presale participation pace. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the price will rise by 16.67% to $0.035. One of the reasons why the presale is attracting so much attention is that it is CertiK audited. In the crypto industry, there is a premium placed on projects that are audited by independent third parties. The team understood this, and early on in the project, they submitted the code for an audit. They received a CertiK Token Scan Score of 80, which has been a major boost for trust in the project. Another reason for the high participation rate is the current analysts’ forecast for MUTM tokens. According to them, the MUTM token price could rise up to 3,450% once the tokens go live. Based on that projection, a $2,400 investment in the presale right now could grow into $82,800 once the tokens launch. Every seasoned investor who has studied the analysis agrees with this forecast and is rushing to secure their MUTM presale tokens. They are also anticipating a massive boon from the planned launch of the beta version of the platform. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to continue building trust with its community. In line with this, they plan to launch a beta version of the platform on the same day the tokens go live. That will allow traders to examine the code for themselves and test the promised features in real time. As word about the beta version spreads, it is expected to trigger a wave of new buyers. That will be of huge benefit to those who secure their tokens early in the presale, as they will get double the gains that those who buy the tokens on the token listing day will get. The Mutuum Finance Giveaway Mutuum Finance has organized a $100,000 giveaway that is designed to reward early supporters of the project. Each participant in the prize giveaway will be eligible for a $10,000 reward. To qualify for the giveaway, you only need to make a $50 investment in the ongoing presale. You are then entered into a draw, where you stand to be one of the ten lucky winners who receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. Overall, the entire design of the presale is designed to benefit early participants the most. That includes the stepped increase in the price of the token from $0.01 in phase to the current price of $0.03. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will reward the top 50 participants in the presale. Those top 50 participants will be posted in a leaderboard on the presale dashboard. They will each be eligible to receive MUTM token bonus tokens. The Protocol Design The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) protocol is a decentralized non-custodial protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. The lenders deposit funds in communal pools where they earn interest. Interest rates are decided based on the pool utilization rate. As more borrowers join a pool, they raise the utilization rate and the interest rate. That encourages borrowers to repay their loans to avoid the rising rate and possible liquidation. At the same time, it causes lenders to deposit more assets to benefit from the growing yields. This process creates a positive feedback loop that ensures that the ecosystem remains at optimal capital efficiency. Amid escalating tensions that have spooked institutional investors, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents the best possibility for growth in the crypto sector. Analysts forecast massive gains of over 30x, giving investors an opportunity to recoup losses during the recent BTC dip. At the low price of $0.03 per token, this is one opportunity you cannot afford to miss.

2025-06-17T21:30:52,"Bitcoin Holds Strong Despite Israel-Iran Tensions – Weekly Resistance Begins To Crack","Bitcoin has weathered a wave of volatility in recent days, triggered by the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. As geopolitical tensions rise and global markets grapple with uncertainty, risk assets like BTC have faced increased pressure. Yet despite this turbulent backdrop, Bitcoin has managed to maintain its footing above key support levels, demonstrating notable resilience. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidation Continues – Altseason May Follow A Clean Break Above Resistance Currently trading just under its all-time high, Bitcoin is in a consolidation phase that many analysts view as the calm before a potential breakout. Top analyst Rekt Capital shared insights indicating that the final major Weekly resistance, which has previously capped price rallies, may now be weakening as a point of rejection. If confirmed, this shift could signal a critical turning point in the market structure and open the door to price discovery. Investors are watching closely as BTC holds strong while macro headwinds—including rising US Treasury yields and fears of energy disruptions—continue to swirl. With the broader market bracing for further developments in the Middle East, Bitcoin’s ability to maintain higher lows and approach resistance with momentum suggests that the bulls may soon reclaim full control. The coming days could prove pivotal for the next phase of BTC’s market cycle. Bitcoin Awaits Clarity As Middle East Tensions Shape Market Sentiment The conflict between Israel and Iran continues to dominate headlines and exert influence over global markets. As tensions escalate, investors remain cautious, closely monitoring geopolitical developments and their macroeconomic ripple effects. In this uncertain environment, Bitcoin has entered a consolidation phase, with neither bulls nor bears fully in control. The lack of a clear direction stems from diverging investor expectations. Optimistic market participants anticipate that a diplomatic resolution may be reached in the coming days or weeks. A peace deal could reduce market anxiety, drive oil prices lower, and reignite momentum across risk assets—Bitcoin included. On the other hand, more cautious investors fear that the situation could worsen. Prolonged conflict may spark volatility in the energy sector, push inflation higher, and strain economic stability, particularly in regions dependent on oil imports. This week may prove decisive for Bitcoin’s next major move. Price action remains tightly bound, but all eyes are on the long-standing Weekly resistance. According to Rekt Capital, the final major Weekly resistance—once a strong rejection point—now appears to be weakening. This shift in structure suggests that Bitcoin may be preparing for a breakout into price discovery territory, should macro conditions stabilize. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Key Range Support – Bulls Set Sights on Higher Levels BTC Price Holds Above Key Support Amid Consolidation The 12-hour chart for Bitcoin shows that BTC continues to trade within a tight range, holding above the critical $103,600 support while struggling to break cleanly through the $109,300 resistance. This zone has repeatedly acted as a ceiling for price action since early May, with sellers stepping in around $109K and buyers defending dips near $104K. The recent bounce from just above the $103,600 level reflects ongoing buyer interest at that range, reinforced by the 100-day SMA (green), which is providing dynamic support. Meanwhile, the 50-day SMA (blue) is curling slightly upward, showing early signs of positive momentum, although the price has yet to clearly reclaim and hold above it. Volume remains moderate, indicating a lack of strong conviction on either side. For bulls to regain full control, BTC must push through the $109,300 resistance with sustained volume and hold that breakout level. A failure to do so may result in another rejection and a potential retest of the lower boundary near $103,600.

2025-06-17T21:30:47,"Gemini Takes Legal Action Against US CFTC: Details","Gemini, a leading cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., has filed a legal complaint against the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). According to a post on X , Gemini accuses the agency of running a seven-year campaign of “lawfare” instead of properly enforcing regulations. Gemini Claims CFTC Spent Years Making False Accusations In the filing, Gemini claims that the CFTC has spent years making false accusations against the crypto platform while ignoring real problems in the digital asset world. The complaint says the regulator used unreliable testimony from a former employee who is no longer credible and has not shown any proof of intentional wrongdoing after seven years of investigation. As U.S. lawmakers and agencies discuss the future of cryptocurrency rules, this lawsuit could influence how regulations are applied in the digital asset industry. The case highlights the frustration among crypto companies that want fair and consistent rules instead of what they see as harsh enforcement without proper procedure. Gemini’s Regulatory Hurdles: A Case of Misrepresentation? The controversy dates back to 2017 when the brainchild of the Winklevoss twins submitted proposals to the CFTC to launch futures contracts for Bitcoin (BTC). The CFTC alleged that the exchange misrepresented critical safeguards to prevent price manipulation. These safeguards were supposed to form the backbone of a trusted financial product, yet the regulator argued Gemini fell short of expectations. Fast-forward to January 2025. Weeks before a trial was set to unravel in Manhattan federal court, Gemini and the CFTC struck a deal. Gemini agreed to pay $5 million to settle the claims , neither admitting nor denying wrongdoing. This settlement underscores the legal tightrope walked by crypto firms aiming to push boundaries while facing increasing scrutiny. SEC Sues Gemini for Earn Program Recall that the Winklevoss brothers’ crypto exchange was under intense scrutiny a few years ago. The scrutiny concerned their Earn Program , which ordinarily allowed users to earn interest on their assets. All they had to do was lend the crypto assets to Genesis Global Capital, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG). However, the program turned negative when FTX imploded in 2022, and Gemini Earn users could not access their funds. It got worse when the US SEC sued both Gemini and Genesis, citing that Gemini Earn was an unregistered offering of securities. On the progress of the Earn Program, the exchange has paid out a $50 million settlement to compensate the investors.

2025-06-17T21:28:56,"Genius Group Expands Bitcoin Holdings by 52% Following Court-Ordered Resumption","AI-powered education group Genius Group has boosted its Bitcoin holdings by more than 50% in a renewed show of confidence in the digital asset. The company disclosed that it increased its corporate Bitcoin treasury from 66 BTC to 100 BTC, an addition of 34 BTC worth approximately $3.42 million, which brings the total value of its holdings to $10.06 million at an average purchase price of $100,600 per Bitcoin. Genius Group Ramps Up Bitcoin Treasury The move comes just weeks after a US Court of Appeals ruling on May 6 lifted restrictions that had temporarily blocked the firm from acquiring additional Bitcoin due to a legal dispute tied to its merger with FatBrain AI. The company resumed its BTC accumulation on May 22 with a $2.7 million investment, a move that signals a broader return to its Bitcoin Treasury Reserve Strategy. The Singapore-based firm has reaffirmed its long-term ambition to grow its holdings to 1,000 BTC, which aligns with a rising trend of institutional adoption amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. In an official statement , Genius Group CEO, Roger Hamilton, said, “We’re pleased to be able to have regained the right to manage our company’s capital in the way our Board and shareholders sees fit. Our 100 Bitcoin milestone is a significant step towards our 1,000 Bitcoin target.” Genius Group suffered a turbulent period earlier this year when it was legally forced to downsize its treasury amid ongoing litigation. In April, the company began liquidating part of its Bitcoin reserves after a US District Court order barred it from raising capital or investing in BTC. At the time, Hamilton criticized the court’s ruling as being rooted in false statements and financial coercion, and claimed the legal actions were orchestrated by individuals already facing fraud allegations. From Crisis to Comeback Data from Google Finance shows that Genius Group’s share price has fallen sharply in 2025, dropping by 68% from highs above $0.70 in early January to a low near $0.22 in April, which closely mirrored the timeline of the company’s legal challenges. However, the stock has shown signs of recovery in recent weeks, trading at $0.36 as of June 17. The modest rebound suggests renewed investor confidence following the May court ruling.

(NYSE: JPM) has unveiled its permissioned stablecoin on the Base network, a top-tier Ethereum (ETH)-based layer two scaling solution backed by Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN). The well-established bank, with around $4 trillion in assets under management (AUM), intends to offer stablecoins services to approved institutional clients. “Kinexys by JPMorgan is launching JPMD, a USD deposit token for institutional clients, on Base. It will be the first token of its kind on a public blockchain, enabling fast, secure, 24/7 money movement between trusted parties,” Base noted . JPMorgan Enters Stablecoins Market On Time After many years of criticizing Bitcoin and the digital asset market, JPMorgan has fully embraced the nascent technology to remain relevant in the future. On Tuesday, the U.S. Senate is expected to pass the GENIUS Act , which will regulate the stablecoins industry. According to Scott Bessent, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, the Stablecoins market could grow from its current $261 billion to about $3.7 trillion by the end of this decade. “A thriving stablecoin ecosystem will drive demand from the private sector for US Treasuries, which back stablecoins. This newfound demand could lower government borrowing costs and help rein in the national debt,” Bessent noted . Impact on Base Network The strategic launch of the JPMD by JPMorgan on the Base network will play a crucial role in increasing its on-chain activity. Already, the Base network is the current leader in Ethereum’s Layer Two (L2) chains, with about $3.7 billion in total value locked (TVL) and around $4.13 billion in stablecoins market cap.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/jpmorgan-unveils-its-u-s-dollar-backed-jpmd-on-stablecoin-ethereums-base/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Crypto news|Ethereum",cryptocompare

2025-06-17T20:45:03,"Tether Buys 32% of Gold Miner to Back ‘Bitcoin-Gold’ Reserve Strategy","This investment is a pivotal move in Tether’s strategy to anchor its ecosystem with tangible assets and precious metals, such as gold and Bitcoin, which will serve both as a financial hedge and a foundation for a more decentralized, resilient digital economy. Why Tether is Eyeing a Bitcoin–Gold Reserve Strategy Tether continues to make a bold move of expanding its reserves beyond traditional holdings. Earlier this month, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino revealed at the Bitcoin 2025 conference that Tether now holds over 100,000 BTC—valued at more than $10 billion—and 50+ tons of physical gold, worth roughly $6 billion. Therefore, Tether’s latest move of acquiring a 32% stake in Elemental Altus through its investment arm called Tether Investments amplifies its dual-pillar reserve strategy. Bitcoin offers decentralization, liquidity, and outsized upside, while gold brings centuries of demonstrated resilience, crisis‑proof value, and stability. Ardoino acknowledged, “Tether’s growing investments in gold and Bitcoin reflect our forward-looking strategy to build a more resilient and transparent financial system. Just as Bitcoin provides the ultimate decentralized hedge against monetary inflation, gold continues to be a time-tested store of value.” Why now? Ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and inflation have pushed many central banks to increase gold allocations. A World Gold Council survey shows 76% expect to raise gold reserves over five years, while nearly 75% plan to reduce dollar holdings; gold prices hit an all‑time high of $3,500/oz in April 2025. Against this backdrop, Tether’s move mirrors institutional trends, aligning stablecoin assets with macroeconomic conditions. By shifting a portion of reserves into BTC and gold, Tether diversifies its exposure, reducing reliance on yield-sensitive instruments. Holding physical gold and Bitcoin enhances the credibility of USDT, responding to longstanding transparency concerns and strengthening Tether’s position as a quasi‑institutional asset manager. Ardoino pointed out, “By gaining exposure to a diversified portfolio of gold royalties through Elemental, we are strengthening the backing of our ecosystem while advancing Tether Gold and future commodity-backed digital assets. This is not just about investment—it’s about building financial infrastructure for the next century.” Will Tether’s Elemental Altus Acquisition Spur a Wave of Commodity-Linked Stablecoins? Tether’s recent acquisition of Elemental Altus is a major strategic move that could accelerate the development of commodity‑linked stablecoins. By strategically accumulating commodity-linked reserves to support a broader suite of asset-backed stablecoins, Tether is deepening its footprint in real-asset tokenization. Through Elemental Altus, Tether seeks to gain exposure to royalties on gold, tungsten, lithium, and other minerals. In the process, this strategy has the potential of triggering a wave of new commodity-pegged coins. Therefore, Tether’s $82 million Elemental Altus acquisition signals more than a simple investment, it’s a prelude to a new era of commodity-backed stablecoins. By securing royalties on diverse natural resources like gold, tokenizing them via Hadron, and leveraging its established USDT infrastructure, Tether is uniquely positioned to lead the next wave of asset-referenced crypto assets. Ardoino stated, “We believe in financial systems that are backed by real assets, not just promises. Our investment in Elemental complements our long-standing belief that tangible assets like Bitcoin and gold will underpin the most durable forms of digital value.” Meanwhile, Tether is not only eyeing the Bitcoin-Gold strategy, but also the artificial intelligence route. For instance, Tether recently revealed plans to roll out a decentralized AI platform dubbed Tether AI because this cutting-edge technology is poised to transform virtually every aspect of both real and digital worlds. Conclusion Tether’s dual‑asset strategy is a calculated evolution. By combining the upside of digital assets with the reliability of gold, the firm seeks to reinforce stablecoin stability and appeal to a broader investor base. In doing so, Tether isn’t just issuing a token, it’s building a reserve-backed financial infrastructure that could trigger a wave of commodity-linked stablecoins.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9603/tether-buys-32-of-gold-miner-to-back-bitcoin-gold-reserve-strategy,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|USDT|XAUT","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Despite ongoing regulatory warnings about the risks associated with cryptocurrencies, BBVA maintains that a modest exposure—starting at 3%—can enhance portfolio performance without significant risk. The bank's current recommendations focus on Bitcoin and Ether, with plans to include other cryptocurrencies later this year.

No answers, just a more paranoid market left picking up the pieces. On June 16, without warning or explanation, the official X account for Pump.fun, the Solana-based memecoin launchpad, was abruptly taken offline. Shortly after, the personal handle of co-founder Alon Cohen (@a1lon9) also vanished. The unexpected purge didn’t stop there. Several other accounts tied to high-profile token platforms, including GMGN, Bloom Trading, and ElizaOS, were swept up in what appeared to many as a coordinated crackdown, raising more questions than answers. Was this X enforcing new policies? A shadowban by overzealous moderators? Or, more ominously, the first sign of regulatory pressure on Solana’s hyperactive memecoin ecosystem? Then, just as suddenly, the accounts were restored. X offered no justification for either decision, leaving traders to wonder whether the episode was a glitch, a warning, or pure bureaucratic randomness. You might also like: Why is Pi Network token down today? Keen users quickly noted Pump.fun’s unceremonious comeback on X and raised concerns about what might be happening behind the scenes. https://t.co/eZhMtacwIT is back and I'm left to wonder what's really going on in the crypto space are all the recent happenings mere coincidences or is there a back story somewhere? Well we keep our eyes primed for more updates, and hope to be on the winning team. https://t.co/pvjbEM7KM6 — Vindex Victor (@EjimV221) June 17, 2025 A billion-dollar memecoin moment under fire The social media blackout came just as Pump.fun was gearing up for a massive token offering, rumored to target a valuation near $1 billion. The reported plan drew both attention and backlash, as Pump.fun’s meteoric rise in 2024–25 made it a poster child for rapid-fire memecoin activity. Founded in January 2024 by Alon Cohen and his team, the platform has hosted more than six million token launches and generated over $350 million in annual revenue. But this growth hasn’t come without scrutiny. In November, Pump.fun was forced to disable its livestream feature after users exploited it to broadcast everything from violent threats to explicit content. That incident exposed the darker side of memecoin culture and how quickly unregulated platforms can spiral into chaos. Now, with its rumored $1 billion token sale drawing mainstream attention, regulators appear to be taking notice. While no agency has publicly claimed responsibility for the X suspensions, the U.S. SEC has been increasingly vocal about cracking down on what it sees as unregistered securities offerings, a category that could easily include memecoin launchpads. What makes this episode particularly troubling for crypto is how it exposes the industry’s dependence on platforms it doesn’t control. Pump.fun’s website continued operating during the suspension, but how long can any platform thrive when its primary marketing channel can vanish overnight? The takeaway is in black and white. In the crypto industry’s ongoing battle between innovation and regulation, social media platforms have become the new battleground. And as Pump.fun’s rollercoaster week shows, the rules of engagement are being written in real time, with billions of dollars hanging in the balance.

2025-06-17T20:10:32,"Brazil Explores Bold Bitcoin Reserve Strategy","BitcoinWorld Brazil Explores Bold Bitcoin Reserve Strategy Exciting developments are unfolding in Latin America! Brazil is taking a significant step towards potentially integrating Bitcoin into its national financial strategy. A bill proposing the allocation of a portion of the country’s foreign exchange reserves to Bitcoin has successfully navigated its initial legislative hurdle. This move, if fully enacted, could position Brazil as a major player in the sovereign adoption of digital assets. What is the Brazil Bitcoin Reserve Bill (RESBiT)? The core of this legislative push is Bill 4501/2023, known as the RESBiT initiative. This proposal outlines a plan to allocate up to 5% of Brazil’s foreign exchange reserves into Bitcoin. Foreign exchange reserves are assets held by a central bank or monetary authority, usually in foreign currencies like the US dollar, Euro, or Yen, along with gold and other financial instruments. They serve crucial purposes such as stabilizing the national currency, managing liquidity, and providing confidence in the country’s financial stability. The idea behind RESBiT is to diversify these reserves by including Bitcoin. The bill has recently passed its first committee stage, a critical step in the long legislative process. This initial success signals growing interest and potential acceptance within Brazilian political circles regarding the strategic role of Bitcoin. Why Would Brazil Consider Bitcoin Reserves? Allocating national reserves to a volatile asset like Bitcoin is a bold move. Several potential motivations could be driving this initiative: Diversification: Reducing reliance on traditional reserve assets and currencies. Inflation Hedge: Viewing Bitcoin as a potential store of value against inflation, similar to gold. Innovation and Technology Adoption: Signaling Brazil’s embrace of digital assets and blockchain technology. Attracting Investment: Potentially making Brazil a more attractive destination for cryptocurrency businesses and investors. Strategic Positioning: Following the lead of other nations or positioning Brazil as a leader in the digital asset space. The proposal suggests a maximum allocation of 5%, indicating a cautious approach rather than a full pivot. This percentage allows for exposure to Bitcoin’s potential upside while limiting the overall risk to the nation’s critical foreign exchange reserves. How Does This Compare to El Salvador’s Bitcoin Strategy? If Bill 4501/2023 becomes law, Brazil would become the second Latin American nation to formally adopt a Bitcoin reserve strategy at the sovereign level, following El Salvador. However, the approaches differ significantly. El Salvador: Made Bitcoin legal tender, acquired significant Bitcoin holdings directly using state funds, and built infrastructure like the Chivo wallet. Their strategy is more integrated into the national economy and aims for broader adoption. Brazil: The RESBiT bill focuses specifically on allocating a portion of existing foreign exchange reserves. It does not propose making Bitcoin legal tender or integrating it directly into daily transactions for citizens on the same scale as El Salvador. It’s primarily a reserve management strategy. Brazil’s potential move is less about making Bitcoin a currency for its citizens and more about treating it as a strategic asset within its national treasury management. This distinction is crucial when evaluating the potential impact and goals of the RESBiT initiative. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges of Bitcoin Reserves? Adding Bitcoin to national reserves comes with potential rewards and significant risks. Potential Benefits: Exposure to a high-growth asset class. Potential hedge against global economic instability or currency devaluation. Increased financial sovereignty by holding an asset not tied to any single government or central bank. Setting a precedent for other nations, potentially increasing Bitcoin’s global legitimacy. Potential Challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is known for dramatic swings, which could impact the value of reserves. Security: Ensuring the secure storage of private keys for national Bitcoin holdings is paramount and complex. Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory landscape for Bitcoin is still evolving. Public and Political Opposition: Skepticism about Bitcoin’s stability and utility could lead to significant internal debate. Liquidity: While Bitcoin is highly liquid, managing large national holdings during times of crisis could present unique challenges. The 5% allocation proposed in the RESBiT bill suggests an awareness of these challenges, aiming for a balance between potential upside and risk mitigation for Brazil’s financial stability. What Happens Next for the Bitcoin Bill in Brazil? Passing the first committee stage is a positive signal, but it is only one step in a multi-stage legislative journey in Brazil. The bill must proceed through other relevant committees, potentially undergo revisions, and ultimately face votes in both houses of the Brazilian National Congress before it can be signed into law by the President. The process can be lengthy and is subject to political dynamics and public opinion. Monitoring the progress of Bill 4501/2023 through the Brazilian legislature will be key for anyone interested in the intersection of national finance and digital assets. The debates and discussions surrounding this bill could also influence how other nations perceive and potentially approach their own Bitcoin reserves or digital asset strategies. Conclusion: Brazil’s Bold Step in the World of Bitcoin Reserves Brazil’s advancement of the RESBiT bill marks a significant moment in the global conversation around sovereign Bitcoin adoption. While distinct from El Salvador’s approach, the potential allocation of foreign exchange reserves to Bitcoin signals a growing recognition of digital assets at the highest levels of national finance. The journey for this bill is far from over, but its initial success highlights a willingness within Brazil to explore innovative strategies for managing national wealth in an increasingly digital world. The outcome of this legislative process could have ripple effects, encouraging further discussion and potential action from other countries considering the role of Bitcoin in their own reserve strategies.
