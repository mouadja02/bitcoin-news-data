BTC 불 토큰 ($BTCBULL), 비트코인 15 만 달러 돌파 이상을 목표로 한 투자 상품으로 주목 BTC 불 토큰($BTCBULL) 은 비트코인과 자체 토큰 $BTCBULL의 무료 에어드롭을 통해 비트코인의 상승장을 기대하는 투자자들의 관심을 모으고 있다. 비트코인 가격이 주요 목표치에 도달할 때마다 에어드랍이 진행될 예정이다. $BTCBULL 토큰 보유자들은 비트코인이 15만 달러와 20만 달러에 도달하면 비트코인을, 25만 달러에 도달하면 $BTCBULL 토큰을 추가로 받을 수 있는 것으로 알려졌다. 네이티브 토큰을 장기 보유할 경우 HODL , 비트코인이 12만 5천 달러, 17만 5천 달러, 22만 5천 달러에 도달할 때마다 이뤄지는 정기적인 토큰 소각으로 인해 가치 상승을 기대할 수 있을 것으로 전망된다. 또한 토큰 스테이킹을 통해 보상을 얻는 방안도 있는 것으로 알려졌다. BTC 불 토큰 프리세일 에 참여하기 위해서는 프리세일 페이지에 접속한 후 암호화폐 지갑(예: 베스트 월렛 )을 프리세일 위젯에 연동하면 된다. 구매하고자 하는 토큰 수량을 입력한 뒤, 신용카드나 직불카드, 또는 암호화폐로 결제를 진행할 수 있다. 프리세일 종료 시 토큰이 지급되며, 투자자들은 토큰 스테이킹을 선택할 수도 있다. 비트코인의 미래에 투자하고자 하는 이들을 위한 상세 정보는 BTC 불 토큰 구매 가이드에서 확인할 수 있다. BTC 불 토큰의 현재 가격은 0.00257달러를 기록하고 있다. 수일 내 가격 상승이 예상되는 가운데, 조기 매수가 유리할 것으로 전망된다. 2. 비트코인 하이퍼 ($HYPER), 비트코인에 속도와 낮은 거래 비용을 도입 비트코인과 밈코인은 암호화폐 세계에서 로미오와 줄리엣, 또는 물과 기름과 같은 관계를 보여왔다. 두 영역은 본질적으로 결합될 수 없는 것으로 여겨졌으나, 비트코인 하이퍼($HYPER) 가 이러한 인식을 바꾸려 하고 있다. 이번 프로젝트는 실시간 확장 가능한 프로그래밍 애플리케이션을 위한 최초의 비트코인 레이어2 개발을 목표로 하고 있다. 이를 통해 비트코인 거래가 더욱 빠르고 저렴한 비용으로 이루어질 것으로 전망된다. 솔라나 가상 머신과 탈중앙화된 캐노니컬 브릿지를 통해 이러한 기능이 구현된다. 이로써 솔라나의 빠른 처리 속도와 낮은 거래 수수료가 비트코인의 타의 추종을 불허하는 보안성과 결합되는 것으로 알려졌다. 비트코인 하이퍼 팀이 프로젝트 자금 조달을 위해 $HYPER 토큰의 사전 판매를 시작했다. 해당 토큰은 L2 내 거래 및 스마트 계약 수수료 지불, DAO 의사결정 및 커뮤니티 제안 에 대한 거버넌스 권한 행사, 그리고 독점 기능 이용 등에 활용될 예정이다. 비트코인 하이퍼 프리세일 웹사이트에서 현재 $HYPER 토큰이 개당 0.011925달러에 판매되고 있다. 대부분의 프리세일 토큰과 마찬가지로, 투자자들은 수동적 수익을 얻기 위해 프로젝트의 스테이킹 풀에 토큰을 예치할 수 있는 것으로 알려졌다. 하이퍼 코인 은 2030년까지 1.50달러에 도달할 것으로 전망되어, 장기 보유 전략도 고려할 만한 것으로 보인다. 3. 네오 페페 ($NEOP), 암호화폐 시장의 탈중앙화를 선도 암호화폐가 주류로 자리잡으면서 정부와 같은 기관들이 이에 대한 통제력을 강화하려는 움직임을 보이고 있다. 이는 탈중앙화를 핵심 가치로 삼는 암호화폐의 본래 취지에 위배되는 상황이다. 이에 네오 페페($NEOP)는 시장에서 탈중앙화가 완전히 사라지기 전에 진정한 의미의 탈중앙화를 되살리고자 하는 목표를 가지고 있다. 네오 페페 토큰 보유자들은 프로젝트의 의사결정 과정에 참여할 수 있는 권한을 갖게 된다. 프로젝트에 새로운 아이디어를 제안하고, 재정 지출 방안에 대한 의견을 제시할 수 있으며, 토큰 상장 거래소 선정에도 참여할 수 있는 것으로 알려졌다. 해당 프로젝트는 프리세일 시작 후 단 10일 만에 140만 달러 이상의 투자금을 모집하며 투자자들의 이목을 빠르게 사로잡았다. 이는 암호화폐 시장에서 탈중앙화가 성공의 핵심 요소라는 사실을 다시 한번 입증하는 결과로 평가된다. 비트코인 15 만 달러 시대 전망 밝아 비트코인의 15만 달러 돌파가 이제 가능성의 문제가 아닌 시기의 문제로 전환됐다. 시장에 자금 유입이 지속될 경우 향후 수개월 내 해당 가격대 도달이 충분히 실현 가능할 것으로 전망된다. 비트코인 시장이 상승세를 보일 때마다 새로운 암호화폐 사전 판매가 호황을 누릴 것으로 전망된다. 이러한 상황에서 BTC 불 토큰($BTCBULL) 과 비트코인 하이퍼($HYPER) 등 비트코인 관련 프로젝트들이 이러한 기회를 활용할 수 있는 최적의 시기와 위치에 있는 것으로 평가된다. 암호화폐 시장의 상위 트렌드에 투자를 고려하는 투자자들은 사전 조사가 필수적인 것으로 알려졌다. 시장의 위험성과 기회 요인을 충분히 파악하고, 감당할 수 있는 범위 내에서 투자를 진행하는 것이 바람직한 것으로 전문가들은 조언하고 있다. 본 기사의 내용은 교육 목적으로만 활용되어야 하며, 투자 자문으로 간주되어선 안 된다는 점을 밝힌다.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-150k-best-presales-kr-2/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Altcoin News",cryptocompare
2025-06-18T13:50:01,"Nobitex Exploit: Massive $48.65M Attack Hits Iranian Crypto Exchange on TRON Network","BitcoinWorld Nobitex Exploit: Massive $48.65M Attack Hits Iranian Crypto Exchange on TRON Network The world of cryptocurrency, while offering exciting opportunities, is unfortunately no stranger to security breaches. The latest incident shaking the market involves Nobitex, a prominent Iranian cryptocurrency exchange. Reports have surfaced detailing a significant Nobitex exploit on the TRON (TRX) Network, resulting in substantial financial losses. This event serves as a stark reminder of the persistent security challenges within the digital asset space. Understanding the Scope of the Nobitex Exploit According to on-chain detective ZachXBT, who shared details on Telegram, the Nobitex exploit led to estimated total losses of approximately $48.65 million. This figure represents a significant amount of value compromised from the exchange’s holdings or user funds held on the platform. Details emerging about the attack point to the use of a vanity address by the attacker. ZachXBT specifically noted the use of an address beginning with ‘TKFuck’, a tactic sometimes employed by malicious actors, potentially to taunt or simply for recognition. While the exact method of the exploit is still under investigation or not fully public, the outcome is clear: a large-scale compromise affecting a major regional exchange. The TRON Network Attack Context The incident specifically occurred on the TRON network attack . TRON is a popular blockchain platform known for its focus on decentralized applications and content sharing. While the exploit targeted Nobitex’s operations or wallets connected to the TRON network, it’s important to distinguish between an attack on the blockchain protocol itself and an attack on an entity operating on the network, like an exchange. In many exchange hacks, the vulnerability lies not within the underlying blockchain technology (like TRON, Bitcoin, or Ethereum) but rather in the exchange’s own systems, such as: Weaknesses in hot or cold wallet management Vulnerabilities in smart contracts used by the exchange Compromised private keys Insufficient security protocols or internal errors Phishing attacks targeting employees Further analysis will likely clarify if the vulnerability was specific to how Nobitex interacted with the TRON network or a more general security lapse within the exchange’s infrastructure that happened to impact TRON-based assets. Broader Implications of a Crypto Exchange Hack A crypto exchange hack like the one experienced by Nobitex has ripple effects far beyond the immediate financial loss. These incidents severely impact user trust, which is a critical component for any financial platform, especially in the nascent crypto industry. When an exchange is compromised, users worry about the safety of their own funds and may withdraw assets, potentially causing liquidity issues for the exchange. Other implications include: Reputational Damage: An exchange’s reputation can be severely tarnished, making it difficult to attract new users or retain existing ones. Regulatory Scrutiny: Security breaches often attract attention from financial regulators, potentially leading to investigations, fines, or stricter compliance requirements. Market Volatility: Large hacks can sometimes cause temporary dips in the prices of affected cryptocurrencies or the broader market due to panic selling or negative sentiment. Increased Security Costs: Exchanges are forced to invest heavily in improving their security infrastructure after an attack, which can be costly. For Nobitex, being the largest exchange in Iran, this event carries particular weight for the local crypto community and its confidence in digital asset platforms. Enhancing Cryptocurrency Security Measures In the wake of incidents like the Nobitex exploit , the focus inevitably shifts to enhancing cryptocurrency security . Both exchanges and individual users play a crucial role in mitigating risks. For exchanges, robust security practices are non-negotiable: Cold Storage: Keeping a vast majority of user funds in offline cold storage wallets, inaccessible from the internet. Multi-Signature Wallets: Requiring multiple private keys to authorize transactions, preventing a single point of failure. Regular Security Audits: Conducting frequent third-party audits of smart contracts, infrastructure, and internal processes. Intrusion Detection Systems: Implementing sophisticated systems to monitor for suspicious activity. Employee Training: Educating staff on phishing risks and secure operational procedures. For users, personal security is paramount: Enable 2FA: Always use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), preferably hardware-based, on your exchange accounts. Strong Passwords: Use unique, complex passwords and consider a password manager. Be Wary of Phishing: Verify the legitimacy of emails and websites before entering login details. Withdraw to Personal Wallets: For long-term storage, withdraw significant amounts of crypto from exchanges to hardware or software wallets where you control the private keys. Research Exchanges: Use reputable exchanges with a strong security track record. The Challenge of Digital Asset Loss and Recovery The estimated $48.65 million figure represents a significant digital asset loss . Recovering stolen cryptocurrency is incredibly challenging. While blockchain transactions are transparent and traceable, identifying and apprehending the individuals behind the wallet addresses used in exploits requires significant effort, often involving international cooperation between law enforcement and blockchain analytics firms. Trackers like ZachXBT play a vital role in following the flow of stolen funds across various networks and exchanges, making it harder for attackers to cash out undetected. However, once funds are laundered through mixers, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), or moved across multiple chains, they can become exceedingly difficult to trace back to an identifiable entity. For users affected by the Nobitex exploit, the path to recovery is uncertain. Exchanges sometimes use insurance funds or their own reserves to compensate users for losses, but this is not always guaranteed and depends heavily on the exchange’s policies and financial health. Conclusion: A Persistent Threat The Nobitex exploit on the TRON Network is another unfortunate chapter in the ongoing struggle for security in the cryptocurrency space. The estimated $48.65 million digital asset loss highlights the lucrative target that exchanges represent for malicious actors. This crypto exchange hack underscores the critical need for exchanges to continuously strengthen their cryptocurrency security measures and for users to adopt vigilant personal security practices. While the transparency of the TRON network allows for tracking, the recovery of funds after a large-scale TRON network attack targeting an exchange remains a complex challenge. As the industry matures, improving security infrastructure and user education will be paramount to building a safer ecosystem for everyone.

2025-06-18T13:41:01,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Consolidation Continues but Bearish Signs Flash","After multiple failed attempts to break above the $108K resistance, Bitcoin is consolidating within a tightening range, showing signs of distribution. The market is caught between two liquidity zones: the buy-side above $108K and the sell-side beneath $100K, while the price slowly gravitates toward the lower boundary. Momentum has weakened as seen in the RSI drop below 50 on both daily and 4H timeframes, suggesting bearish pressure is gaining control. By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart Bitcoin remains stuck in a broader consolidation pattern, forming a descending triangle just below a major resistance level. The RSI is holding around 46, and the price is still above the key trendline depicted in orange. This structure reflects a classic re-accumulation or distribution phase. If the bulls fail to reclaim $108K with conviction, the ascending trendline becomes a likely magnet. Moreover, the orange 100-day MA and the blue 200-day MA are still pointing up but have narrowed near the $95K region, indicating a slowdown in trend strength. The daily range between $100K–$108K is critical. So far, buyers have absorbed dips into the $101K–$103K zone, but continued lower highs and failure to flip the $108K area into support suggest the market may be preparing for a deeper sweep of liquidity. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, the price action has formed a clear descending channel. The lower highs show consistent bearish pressure, while support at $103.5K is being tested repeatedly. This is often a bearish continuation pattern, and with RSI around 41, the momentum leans toward the downside. The failure to break through the fair value gap (FVG) around $106K, and even failing to test it, confirms that sellers are defending the premium levels efficiently. Currently, market participants can expect a quick sweep of the double sell-side liquidity levels marked around $102K and $103K. A break and close below these levels could open up a run toward the key daily demand at the $100K area. Meanwhile, any upside breakout above $110K must begin with a reclaim of the FVG zone convincingly to flip short-term sentiment. On-Chain Analysis Exchange Whale Ratio The whale ratio on exchanges has surged above 0.55, its highest point in over a year, which is typically considered a warning signal. This metric measures the proportion of the top 10 inflows to total inflows on exchanges. Historically, a rising whale ratio means large holders are increasingly active on exchanges, likely preparing to sell. This shift often precedes corrections or sharp volatility, especially when retail activity is cooling off. Combining this with stagnant price action below key resistance, the current whale behavior suggests cautious distribution rather than aggressive accumulation. If the whale ratio remains elevated while BTC trades sideways or drops further, it strengthens the case for a liquidity sweep below $100K before any potential continuation higher.

2025-06-18T13:40:59,"Urgent Shift: Bitcoin Mining Giants Expand US Production Amid China Tariffs","BitcoinWorld Urgent Shift: Bitcoin Mining Giants Expand US Production Amid China Tariffs The global landscape of Bitcoin mining is undergoing a significant transformation, largely driven by geopolitical forces. For years, the production of the specialized computer hardware essential for mining, known as ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits), has been dominated by a handful of companies based in China. However, the ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China have created powerful incentives for these manufacturing giants to reconsider their strategies and geographical footprint. This strategic pivot is not just a business decision; it’s a structural shift impacting the entire crypto mining supply chain and raising important questions about national security and economic resilience. Understanding the Giants Driving US Manufacturing Expansion At the heart of this story are three titans of the mining hardware industry: Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT. These companies collectively hold an estimated over 90% share of the global market for Bitcoin mining rigs. Their dominance means that virtually every large-scale Bitcoin mining operation, regardless of its location, relies heavily on their products. For decades, their manufacturing base has been primarily in China, leveraging the country’s established electronics supply chain, infrastructure, and labor force. However, the imposition of tariffs under former President Donald Trump’s administration, specifically targeting goods imported from China, significantly increased the cost of these crucial components for US-based mining operations. These tariffs acted as a direct financial burden, making it more expensive to set up or expand mining facilities in the United States. This economic pressure point became a major catalyst for the Chinese manufacturers to explore alternatives to mitigate the impact and remain competitive in a key market. Why Are China Tariffs Pushing Mining Hardware Production to the US? The primary driver for Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT’s decision to ramp up US manufacturing is the direct financial penalty imposed by the tariffs. Importing ASICs manufactured in China into the United States incurs substantial additional costs, which are ultimately passed on to the customers – the US Bitcoin miners. By establishing production capabilities within the US, these companies can potentially bypass or significantly reduce these tariff-related expenses, making their products more cost-effective for American buyers. Beyond just tariffs, other factors are at play: Market Proximity: The United States has rapidly become one of the largest and most attractive regions for Bitcoin mining globally, thanks to factors like access to abundant, often cheap, energy sources (renewables, natural gas flares) and a favorable regulatory environment in certain states. Having production closer to this major customer base can improve logistics, reduce shipping times and costs, and allow for quicker response to market demand. Supply Chain Resilience: Relying on a single manufacturing hub, especially one in a potentially adversarial geopolitical environment, introduces significant supply chain risks. Diversifying production locations enhances resilience against future trade disputes, export restrictions, or other disruptions. National Security Concerns: As the article notes, the heavy reliance of US infrastructure (including crypto mining, which is seen by some as critical digital infrastructure) on hardware from a geopolitical rival has raised national security concerns. While the manufacturers’ move is primarily economic, it aligns with broader calls for diversifying critical supply chains away from China. Customer Relationships: Local production can facilitate stronger relationships with large institutional mining clients in the US, offering better support, repair services, and potentially customized solutions. Examining the Strategies: How Are the Giants Adapting? Each of the big three is implementing its own version of a localization strategy: Bitmain: As the market leader, Bitmain made an early move, reportedly beginning production in the U.S. in December 2023. This timing, shortly after the U.S. presidential election, suggests a proactive approach to navigate the political landscape and potential future trade policies. Bitmain has previously explored US operations, including mining farms, indicating a long-term interest in the North American market. Canaan: Canaan, another major player, initiated trial manufacturing in April. The timing here is also notable, following discussions around potential new or reinforced tariffs, sometimes referred to informally as ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs in political discourse. Trial manufacturing allows Canaan to test the feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and logistical challenges of US production before committing to a larger scale. MicroBT: The maker of the popular Whatsminer series is focusing on a broader “localization strategy.” This might involve not just manufacturing but also establishing stronger local sales, support, and repair networks. While the specific details of their US production plans might differ, the goal is the same: reduce exposure to trade restrictions and better serve the North American market. It’s important to note that “production” in the US might initially focus on assembly rather than the complex, capital-intensive fabrication of the ASIC chips themselves, which still heavily relies on advanced foundries primarily located in Asia (like TSMC in Taiwan). However, even assembly in the US represents a significant step towards shifting part of the value chain geographically. What Does This Mean for the US Crypto Mining Landscape? The expansion of mining hardware production within the United States has several potential implications for the domestic crypto mining industry: Reduced Costs (Potentially): By avoiding tariffs, the cost of acquiring new mining rigs could decrease for US operators, improving profitability and encouraging further investment in domestic mining infrastructure. Faster Deployment: Shorter supply chains mean quicker delivery times for new equipment, allowing miners to scale their operations more rapidly in response to market conditions. Enhanced Supply Chain Security: Domestic production offers greater predictability and security of supply compared to relying solely on imports subject to geopolitical risks. Job Creation: Establishing and operating manufacturing or assembly plants creates jobs in the US, contributing to the local economy in states that attract these facilities. Development of Domestic Expertise: Increased manufacturing activity can foster the development of a skilled workforce and technical expertise related to ASIC production and maintenance within the US. While the benefits are clear, challenges remain. The cost of labor and manufacturing in the US is generally higher than in China. Sourcing components, many of which are still produced in Asia, could also present logistical hurdles. However, the strategic advantages, particularly tariff avoidance and supply chain security, appear to outweigh these challenges for the major players. Beyond Tariffs: The Long-Term Impact on the Global Mining Supply Chain The shift of Chinese mining hardware manufacturers towards US production is more than a temporary response to trade policy; it signals a potential long-term restructuring of the global Bitcoin mining supply chain. For years, the supply chain has been heavily centralized in East Asia, from chip design and fabrication to assembly and distribution. This move suggests a trend towards decentralization and regionalization. As more production capacity is established outside of China, other regions like North America could develop more robust local ecosystems for mining hardware – including repair centers, component suppliers, and potentially even domestic design and fabrication capabilities in the future. This could lead to a more diversified and resilient global mining network, less susceptible to disruptions in any single country. Furthermore, this trend could encourage the emergence or growth of non-Chinese mining hardware manufacturers, fostering greater competition in a market currently dominated by the big three. While challenging, the opportunity exists for companies in the US or other geopolitically neutral countries to capture market share by offering domestically produced or assembled hardware. Addressing National Security and Supply Chain Concerns The concerns around national security stem from the potential for hardware backdoors or vulnerabilities embedded during the manufacturing process, as well as the strategic risk of relying on a competitor for essential digital infrastructure components. While these concerns are complex and often debated, a shift towards domestic or allied-country production of Bitcoin mining equipment can, in theory, alleviate some of these worries by bringing parts of the supply chain under the jurisdiction and oversight of the host country. Increased US manufacturing of mining hardware contributes to greater supply chain transparency and potentially allows for more stringent security checks and quality control processes that align with US standards and regulations. This is particularly relevant as Bitcoin mining becomes increasingly integrated into the energy sector and attracts larger institutional players. What’s Next? The Future of Mining Hardware Production The success and scale of these initial US production efforts will likely determine the extent of future expansion. Factors to watch include: The evolution of US trade policy towards China. The cost-effectiveness of US manufacturing compared to traditional hubs. The ability to build a skilled workforce and reliable local component supply chains in the US. Demand from US-based mining operations. If these initiatives prove successful, we could see a more permanent shift, with a significant portion of global mining hardware assembly serving the North American market being done locally. This would not only reshape the business models of the major manufacturers but also further solidify North America’s position as a major global hub for crypto mining activity. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Bitcoin Mining The decision by Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT to expand production in the United States marks a pivotal moment for the Bitcoin mining industry. Driven primarily by the economic pressures of China tariffs , this move is accelerating a broader trend towards the regionalization and diversification of the global mining hardware supply chain. While challenges in manufacturing costs and component sourcing remain, the strategic benefits of being closer to a major market like the US, avoiding tariffs, and enhancing supply chain security are compelling. This shift is not just about where machines are made; it’s about building a more resilient, geographically diverse, and potentially more secure foundation for the future of Bitcoin mining worldwide. As the US continues to grow as a mining destination, domestic hardware production could become an increasingly vital component of its digital infrastructure.

2025-06-18T13:34:29,"War Headlines Hit Bitcoin—But Dip Buyers Eye New Highs","Bitcoin price action has been a roller coaster this week, as escalating Middle East tensions and dramatic Washington headlines have triggered sharp intraday swoons—only to be met by stubborn dip-buying that's kept BTC within striking distance of its all-time highs. As Israel and Iran exchange missile strikes and former President Trump takes emergency security meetings, risk appetite worldwide has faltered, but Bitcoin's underlying bullish momentum is undeniable. Geopolitical Shockwaves and Trump's Security Meetings The latest bout of volatility began after reports that Israel had launched its largest attack on Iran in decades, sparking fear of wider regional conflict. It took a turn for the worse after Trump abruptly pulled out of the G7 summit and called for an emergency Situation Room meeting, urging Americans to depart Tehran. The market's reaction was immediate: Bitcoin lost over $2,000 in a matter of hours, and altcoins plummeted even harder, wiping out $80 billion in cryptocurrency market capitalization. Traders were hit with nearly $400 million in liquidations, with leveraged longs being blindsided. Yet, as the dust settled, Bitcoin's price stabilized above $103,000. This kind of resilience is similar to previous wartime shocks, where BTC sold off in the first instance but soon got back on its feet as markets adjusted to the new reality. In fact, historical data shows that after similar events—like the Israel-Gaza war in 2023 and the Iran embassy bombing in 2024—Bitcoin can bounce back within weeks, sometimes even outperforming traditional safe havens like gold. Funding Rates and ETF Inflows Continue to Be Bullish The special thing about this cycle is the speed and size of the bounce. On-chain metrics and derivatives markets show that, even as headlines spooked retail investors, institutional players and seasoned traders viewed the dip as a buying opportunity. Bitcoin perpetual futures funding rates, which temporarily turned negative during panic, have flipped positive again—meaning traders are paying a premium to hold long positions and are expecting higher prices in the future. ETF flows tell the same story. Despite the price decline, U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs gathered over $200 million of net inflows, led by BlackRock's IBIT with $639 million in a single day. Although inflows slowed from last week's record pace, the nine-week streak of positive flows has pushed year-to-date ETF inflows to $13.2 billion. That suggests that institutional investors remain confident in Bitcoin's long-term trajectory, even as short-term volatility shakes out less determined participants. Macro Context: How Bitcoin Behaves In Wartime Bitcoin's relationship with geopolitical risk is evolving. Historically, BTC has been considered a ”digital gold” hedge, but recent cycles have seen it behave more like a risk asset—selling off in conjunction with equities in crises, prior to rebounding as markets stabilize. Bitwise and CoinShares researchers note that Bitcoin's volatility has reduced structurally over time but remains vulnerable to global shocks. But the evidence shows that Bitcoin's post-war recoveries can be quick and decisive. After the COVID crash in 2020, BTC lost half its value within days, only to gain 583% over the next year. In the Russia-Ukraine war during 2022, Bitcoin dropped 20% before gaining 65% over two months. In spite of recent Israel-Iran tensions, BTC's ability to hold key support levels and attract new inflows is a sign of a market that's ageing—and increasingly being driven by institutional money. The Bottom Line Despite war-driven volatility and headline risk, the underlying Bitcoin narrative remains unchanged. Dip-buyers, positive funding rates, and relentless ETF inflows suggest the market's conviction is stronger than fear. If history is any guide, Bitcoin's strength amidst geopolitical shock can yet again set the stage for fresh highs—especially with institutions still buying and traders betting on a V-shaped recovery.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9614/war-headlines-hit-bitcoin-but-dip-buyers-eye-new-highs,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

The firm has appointed Kathleen Wrynn, a seasoned JP Morgan executive, to lead its $1.6 billion cryptocurrency division. The hire comes at a time when institutional interest in digital assets is gaining strong momentum. Invesco’s decision reflects a clear intention to be a major player in the future of crypto investing. Crypto’s New Leader: Wrynn Assumes Command As traditional finance continues warming up to crypto, Invesco’s move to bring in Wrynn is more than a leadership shuffle. It signals a strategic push to stay ahead. Wrynn brings a strong track record from her years at JP Morgan. She now leads Invesco’s digital asset strategy, which includes managing three Blockchain and Crypto Ecosystem ETFs, along with three Global Spot Cryptocurrency ETFs. At the Morgan Stanley U.S. Financials Conference, an Invesco spokesperson detailed her mission: “She will work closely with the global technology organization to identify and lead opportunities to leverage blockchain technology, such as tokenizing funds and integrating digital assets into investment strategies.” This appointment shows Invesco’s commitment to innovation in the crypto space. Institutional Crypto Rise: Invesco Joins the Trend Invesco’s action corresponds with a Coinbase report indicating that 86% of institutional investors are either involved in or intend to enter crypto by 2025.

2025-06-18T13:30:47,"XRP ETF Canada: Evolve Funds Poised for Historic Launch on Toronto Stock Exchange","BitcoinWorld XRP ETF Canada: Evolve Funds Poised for Historic Launch on Toronto Stock Exchange Get ready, Canadian crypto enthusiasts! A potentially significant development is on the horizon for accessing digital assets through traditional investment vehicles. Canada’s Evolve Funds Group has announced its intention to launch the Evolve XRP ETF , bringing the popular cryptocurrency Ripple XRP into the regulated exchange-traded fund space on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). This move could mark a new chapter for investors looking to gain exposure to Ripple XRP without directly holding the digital asset. What is the Evolve XRP ETF and Why Does it Matter? The Evolve XRP ETF is designed to provide investors with exposure to the daily price movements of XRP, the digital asset associated with the Ripple payment network. Unlike buying and storing XRP yourself on a crypto exchange, an ETF trades on a traditional stock exchange like the Toronto Stock Exchange , making it accessible through standard brokerage accounts. This proposed XRP ETF Canada offering is significant for several reasons: Accessibility: It simplifies the investment process for traditional investors who are comfortable with brokerage platforms but might find navigating crypto exchanges and wallets daunting. Regulation: Trading on a regulated exchange like the TSX brings a level of oversight and investor protection not always present in direct crypto markets. Institutional Interest: The availability of an ETF can attract institutional investors who have mandates preventing direct crypto holdings but can invest in regulated fund products. Market Validation: The launch of a dedicated Canada Crypto ETF for XRP, following similar products for Bitcoin and Ethereum, signals growing acceptance and maturity of the digital asset class within Canadian financial markets. The ETF is expected to trade under the ticker symbols XRP (for the Canadian Dollar unhedged units) and XRP.U (for the US Dollar units), pending final approval from the TSX. How Does the Evolve XRP ETF Fit into the Canada Crypto ETF Landscape? Canada has been a leader in approving cryptocurrency ETFs, starting with Bitcoin and Ethereum products. Evolve Funds itself was among the first to launch a Bitcoin ETF (EBIT) and an Ethereum ETF (ETHR) on the TSX. The potential arrival of the Evolve XRP ETF further diversifies the options available to Canadian investors seeking regulated exposure to digital assets. Here’s a quick look at the evolving landscape: Asset Existing ETFs in Canada Evolve’s Offering Bitcoin (BTC) Multiple (e.g., Purpose, Evolve, CI Galaxy) Evolve Bitcoin ETF (EBIT) Ethereum (ETH) Multiple (e.g., Purpose, Evolve, CI Galaxy) Evolve Ether ETF (ETHR) XRP (Ripple) None (as of announcement) Proposed Evolve XRP ETF This expansion suggests growing investor demand and regulatory comfort with offering exposure to a wider range of prominent cryptocurrencies through the traditional financial system. The XRP ETF Canada would be a notable addition, offering access to an asset with a different use case (cross-border payments) compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum. Considering the Evolve XRP ETF: Benefits and Potential Drawbacks Like any investment, the proposed Evolve XRP ETF comes with its own set of potential upsides and considerations. Understanding these is crucial before making any investment decisions. Potential Benefits: Ease of Investment: As mentioned, buying shares of an ETF through a brokerage account is often simpler than managing private keys or dealing with different crypto exchange interfaces. Liquidity: ETFs trade throughout the day on the Toronto Stock Exchange , offering liquidity that can sometimes be challenging on smaller crypto exchanges. No Custody Worries: Investors don’t need to worry about securely storing XRP themselves; the fund handles the custody of the underlying asset. Diversification Potential: For investors building a diversified portfolio, an XRP ETF Canada could offer exposure to the digital asset sector through a regulated product. Potential Drawbacks: Fees: ETFs charge management fees, which can eat into returns over time compared to holding the asset directly (though direct holding has its own costs like exchange fees). Tracking Error: While designed to track the price of XRP, ETFs can sometimes experience minor tracking differences due to operational costs and market dynamics. Regulatory Uncertainty for XRP: While the ETF is regulated in Canada, the underlying asset, Ripple XRP , has faced significant regulatory challenges in other jurisdictions (most notably the ongoing SEC lawsuit in the United States), which can impact its price volatility and future prospects. Market Volatility: The price of XRP, like other cryptocurrencies, is highly volatile. Investing in the ETF means accepting this inherent market risk. Investors should weigh these factors carefully and consider their own risk tolerance and investment goals. What’s Next? The Path to Launch for the Evolve XRP ETF According to reports, the Evolve XRP ETF is currently awaiting final approval from the Toronto Stock Exchange . This is a standard step in the process for listing new financial products. Once approved, the ETF will become available for trading on the TSX under the specified ticker symbols. The exact launch date will depend on the timing of this final regulatory clearance. The launch of this Canada Crypto ETF for XRP could potentially: Increase mainstream investor exposure to Ripple XRP. Potentially impact the liquidity and trading volume of XRP. Further solidify Canada’s position as a leading jurisdiction for regulated crypto investment products. Market participants will be watching closely to see how the ETF is received by investors and what impact it has on the broader crypto market, particularly for Ripple XRP . Actionable Insights for Investors If you are considering investing in the proposed Evolve XRP ETF , here are a few steps you might consider: Stay Informed: Keep an eye out for the official approval announcement from Evolve Funds and the TSX. Understand XRP: Before investing in the ETF, take the time to understand what Ripple XRP is, its technology, use cases, and the regulatory environment surrounding it. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrency markets are volatile. Ensure your investment aligns with your personal risk profile. Consult a Financial Advisor: Consider speaking with a qualified financial advisor to understand how this ETF might fit into your overall investment strategy. Summary: A New Era for XRP Access in Canada? The announcement by Evolve Funds Group regarding the planned launch of the Evolve XRP ETF on the Toronto Stock Exchange is a significant development for the Canadian crypto investment landscape. It represents the potential introduction of the first regulated ETF product offering exposure to Ripple XRP in the country. This move underscores the growing acceptance of digital assets within traditional finance and provides Canadian investors with another avenue to participate in the crypto market through a familiar and regulated structure. While awaiting final approval, the prospect of the XRP ETF Canada is certainly creating buzz among investors interested in expanding their digital asset portfolios.

2025-06-18T13:30:38,"Researchers Forecast Bitcoin At $4.3 Million By 2036, Citing Institutional Demand","In a striking forecast, two academic researchers, Murray Rudd and Dennis Porter, have predicted that Bitcoin (BTC) could soar to an astonishing $4.3 million by 2036 if institutional buying trends continue. This prediction was highlighted by market expert Giovanni Incasa, who emphasized the significance of applying rigorous supply-demand theories to Bitcoin’s unique economic structure. Supply Shock Warning Rudd and Porter have employed pure mathematical modeling to analyze Bitcoin’s market dynamics, warning that the impending supply shock could lead to price fluctuations ten times more severe than anything seen to date. Their findings suggest that the effects of this supply shock will result in permanent wealth redistribution, fundamentally altering the landscape of digital assets. Related Reading: On-Chain Analyst Warns: Bitcoin Peak Expected, Altcoins Facing -95% Plunge According to their conservative estimates, the Bitcoin price could reach $2.2 million per coin by 2036, a projection rooted in what they describe as “economic physics.” The researchers note that the current liquid supply of Bitcoin stands at only 11.2 million coins, with an estimated 4 million Bitcoin lost forever due to lost keys and Satoshi Nakamoto’s unspent stash. Their analysis reveals that only half of BTC’s total supply is actively liquid, meaning that even modest institutional purchases could lead to significant supply shortages. Evidence of this trend can be seen in the daily buying habits of US exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have averaged 285 Bitcoin per day since their launch, and the actions of Bitcoin treasury companies that are removing thousands of coins from circulation through debt financing. Senator Cynthia Lummis has also proposed a strategic reserve of one million Bitcoin, which would involve an acquisition of approximately 550 coins per day over five years. The researchers calculate that if 2,000 Bitcoin are removed from circulation daily, the price could reach $106,000—a figure that is already close to today’s trading price of $104,800, suggesting that their mathematical framework is holding true. The crux of the researchers’ findings is that traditional supply curves are not applicable to BTC. Its perfectly inelastic supply creates significant bottlenecks as demand rises, leading to dramatic price increases. They emphasize that institutions that delay their investments risk becoming permanently priced out of the market. Three Scenarios For Bitcoin Rudd and Porter outline three potential scenarios for Bitcoin’s future. In a conservative scenario, with a 20-fold increase in demand and continued institutional adoption leading to 2,000 daily Bitcoin withdrawals, prices could reach $2.2 million by 2036. Their bullish scenario posits a 30-fold demand growth, where Bitcoin could hit $5 million by early 2031. The most extreme, hyperbolic scenario anticipates a 40-fold demand increase, with daily withdrawals escalating to 4,000 Bitcoin, potentially driving prices to $4.3 million by 2036 and valuing Bitcoin at six times the current market cap of gold.

2025-06-18T13:30:36,"XRP Beginner’s Guide — What You Need to Know","If you’re new to crypto or finally taking a closer look at XRP, this guide provides everything you need to understand one of the most practical and widely used digital assets in the space. In a clear and insightful thread on X, well-known crypto analyst Pumpius broke down XRP’s core features and real-world applications, cutting through the noise to focus on facts. Building on that foundation, this guide explores what XRP is, how it works, and why it matters today. What Is XRP? XRP is a digital asset built for real-time, cross-border payments. While Bitcoin was created to function as a decentralized store of value, XRP was specifically designed to make global money transfers faster, cheaper, and more scalable. According to Pumpius, XRP processes transactions in just three to five seconds, costs less than a cent per transaction, and can handle over 1,500 transactions per second. This speed and efficiency are what separate XRP from most other cryptocurrencies. It isn’t meant to replace traditional money, but rather to upgrade how money moves. As Pumpius puts it, “It’s not ‘just another coin. ’ It’s infrastructure.” Beginner’s Guide to $XRP — What You Need to Know If you’re just getting into crypto or finally curious about XRP, this thread breaks down what it is, how it works, and why it matters. No hype. No noise. Just facts. pic.twitter.com/fIqSz4U106 — Pumpius (@pumpius) June 17, 2025 Understanding the XRP Ledger (XRPL) The technology behind XRP is the XRP Ledger , commonly referred to as XRPL. This is the decentralized blockchain network where XRP transactions take place. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which depend on energy-heavy mining, XRPL uses a consensus mechanism that doesn’t require mining at all. This makes it environmentally friendly, incredibly fast, and highly reliable, with the ledger closing every few seconds. Pumpius explains it best: “Think of XRPL as the highway. XRP is the car.” The ledger also comes with advanced capabilities, including a built-in decentralized exchange (DEX), native tokenization, and support for real-world assets like stablecoins, NFTs, and even tokenized biotech data. This makes the XRPL not just a payments network but a powerful platform for developers and institutions building on-chain solutions. Who Uses XRP and the XRPL? XRP’s real-world use extends well beyond trading. Ripple, the fintech company closely associated with XRP, uses it to develop global payment solutions for financial institutions. Through RippleNet and On-Demand Liquidity, XRP helps banks and remittance companies settle international payments within seconds, removing the need for pre-funded accounts and reducing costs. Pumpius highlights that XRP and XRPL aren’t just used by banks. Developers are building a wide range of projects on the ledger, including DeFi protocols, tokenized asset platforms, and even biotech applications such as XRP Healthcare and DNA Protocol. These projects demonstrate that XRP is not just about finance; it’s about enabling secure and efficient value transfer across multiple industries. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP vs. Other Cryptocurrencies Each major cryptocurrency serves a different role. Bitcoin is widely viewed as a store of value, often referred to as digital gold . Ethereum dominates the smart contract space but faces persistent issues with network congestion and high fees . XRP, in contrast, is optimized for real-time value transfers and liquidity provisioning. Pumpius summarizes it this way: “XRP isn’t trying to replace banks—it’s replacing their plumbing.” Instead of tearing down the financial system, XRP enhances the infrastructure behind it. Legal Status and Regulatory Clarity One of the most significant milestones in XRP’s journey came in 2023, when U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not a security when sold on digital asset exchanges. This decision gave XRP a rare level of regulatory clarity in the United States—something that most cryptocurrencies still lack. Pumpius rightly called it “one of the most important wins in crypto history.” The ruling allowed XRP to be relisted on major U.S. exchanges and restored institutional confidence in the asset. How to Store XRP Safely Pumpius stresses the importance of self-custody for those holding XRP. Rather than leaving assets on exchanges, where users don’t control their private keys, he advises using secure wallets such as Xaman, Tangem, or Ledger hardware wallets. As he puts it, “Not your keys = not your coins.” In crypto, maintaining control of your assets is essential. Final Thoughts XRP is not built on hype. As Pumpius concluded, “XRP is not hype. It’s not a meme. It’s one of the most adopted, fastest, and legally clarified assets in crypto.” With a clear use case, powerful infrastructure, and growing adoption across sectors, XRP stands out as a practical tool in the future of finance and decentralized value transfer. For beginners seeking a serious and credible introduction to digital assets, XRP is a smart place to start. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) dropped to $104,650 on Wednesday, June 18, marking a 6.52% decline from its highest level this year. Option traders are increasingly betting on further declines. Data from Deribit shows that the put-to-call volume ratio rose to 2.17, indicating that more traders are buying put options as a hedge. A put option gives investors the right, but not the obligation, to sell an asset at a specific price within a defined time period. In this case, for contracts expiring on Friday, open interest in put options is concentrated at the $100,000 strike. Investors remain cautious amid the escalating crisis in the Middle East .

It has formed a double-top pattern with a neckline at $100,300, a formation often associated with bearish breakouts. Bitcoin has also fallen below the 50-period Exponential Moving Average and is approaching the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. Meanwhile, the MACD indicator has dropped below the zero line. As such, Bitcoin may continue falling, with the next level to watch being $100,300, about 4.2% below current prices.

2025-06-18T13:21:09,"Paris-Based Technology Firm The Blockchain Group Announces It Bought a Large Number of Bitcoins! Here Are the Details","The Blockchain Group (ALTBG), a Paris-based technology firm that positions itself as Europe’s first Bitcoin treasury company, has announced that it has added 182 more Bitcoins to its portfolio. The company’s latest purchase was worth around 17 million euros ($19.6 million). The Blockchain Group Continues Bitcoin Purchases: 182 More BTC Added, Bringing Total Value Over $170 Million With the latest purchase, the company's total Bitcoin holdings reached 1,653 BTC, with a total market value of approximately 149 million euros (approximately $171 million). The company also drew attention with its 1,173% “BTC yield” so far in 2025. This ratio is calculated by dividing the total amount of Bitcoin held by the company’s fully diluted share count. This metric is used to show how effective companies’ Bitcoin acquisition strategies are. For comparison, MicroStrategy (MSTR), the world’s largest institutional Bitcoin holder, reported a 19.1% BTC yield since the beginning of the year, while Japan-based Metaplanet (3350) reported a 266.07% yield and US-based Semler Scientific (SMLR) reported a 26.7% yield. Bitcoin Purchases Funded by Bond and Stock Proceeds The Bitcoin purchase was financed by a convertible bond issue worth more than €18 million, with investors including UTXO Management, Moonlight Capital, Ludovic Chechin-Laurans and asset manager TOBAM. The company also raised an additional €1.6 million by converting its stock purchase warrants into approximately 3 million new shares, and used this proceeds to purchase Bitcoin. The Blockchain Group’s Bitcoin purchases were made through Swissquote Bank Europe and Banque Delubac, while the crypto assets are being held in custody by Switzerland-based digital asset infrastructure provider Taurus. The company's average cost of Bitcoin purchases is around 90,000 euros (about $103,000). Following the news of the acquisition, the company's shares were traded on the Euronext Paris exchange in the morning hours, down 2.1% at 4,895 euros, while France's CAC 40 index remained flat.

2025-06-18T13:20:12,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Holders Defy Gravity, Signaling Potent Q3 Breakout","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Analysis: Holders Defy Gravity, Signaling Potent Q3 Breakout The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, and few assets capture the market’s attention quite like Bitcoin (BTC). Recently, observers have noted a fascinating shift in Bitcoin’s typical correlation patterns. Despite a backdrop of rising geopolitical uncertainty, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable stability, diverging from its usual behavior as a purely risk-on or risk-off asset. This unexpected resilience is a key point in understanding the current Bitcoin price analysis . Understanding Current Bitcoin Holder Behavior A significant factor contributing to Bitcoin’s current stability lies within the actions of its long-term investors. According to insights highlighted by Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, and reported by CoinDesk, extensive blockchain data indicates that seasoned BTC holders are largely maintaining their positions. There are minimal signs of widespread profit-taking, even as Bitcoin’s price has seen recent gains. This steadfast Bitcoin holder behavior is a powerful signal, suggesting conviction rather than caution among those who have held BTC through various market cycles. They aren’t just holding; they appear to be accumulating or at least refraining from selling into strength, which removes significant selling pressure from the market. What Does This Mean for the Bitcoin Market Outlook? This observed reluctance of long-term holders to sell is a crucial piece of the puzzle when assessing the broader Bitcoin market outlook . When large portions of the supply are held off-market by conviction holders, it naturally reduces the available supply for trading. This dynamic contributes directly to the ongoing period of price consolidation we are witnessing. Instead of volatile swings driven by quick profit-taking, the market is absorbing demand without a corresponding flood of sell orders from established participants. This consolidation phase, while potentially frustrating for short-term traders, is often viewed by analysts as a necessary period of building a strong base before a potential significant price move. Key takeaways from the current market structure: Reduced Selling Pressure: Long-term holders acting as ‘HODLers’ limit the supply entering the market. Price Consolidation: Demand is being met without significant price drops, leading to sideways movement. Foundation Building: This period allows the market to establish support levels and prepare for future moves. Divergence from Risk Assets: Bitcoin’s stability amidst geopolitical tension suggests maturity or unique market drivers. Is a Crypto Market Q3 Breakout on the Horizon? The stable foundation built during this consolidation phase, underpinned by strong Bitcoin holder behavior , has led many analysts, including Kuptsikevich, to eye the third quarter of the year for a potential breakout. The theory is that this prolonged period of stability is coiling like a spring. When a catalyst eventually arrives – whether it’s positive macroeconomic news, increased institutional adoption, or a significant technical level being breached – the reduced selling pressure from holders could allow the price to move upward more freely and rapidly. The Crypto market Q3 outlook is becoming a focal point for investors hoping for renewed bullish momentum. Potential catalysts for a Q3 move could include: Positive developments around Bitcoin Spot ETFs (flow data, new approvals). Changes in global monetary policy (e.g., interest rate decisions). Increased corporate or institutional investment announcements. Significant technical chart patterns completing their formation. Positive regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions. Considering Your BTC Price Prediction Strategy Given the current dynamics, what should investors consider when formulating their BTC price prediction or investment strategy? While no one can predict the future with certainty, the current market structure provides valuable clues. The strength shown by holders suggests underlying confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. However, potential challenges remain. Challenges to a Q3 Breakout Despite the optimistic signs, several factors could challenge or delay a potential breakout: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Unexpected global economic downturns or market crashes could still impact risk assets like Bitcoin. Regulatory Uncertainty: Negative regulatory news from major countries could dampen sentiment. Black Swan Events: Unforeseen global events could disrupt market stability. Whale Activity: While long-term holders are strong, concentrated selling from large individual or institutional wallets could still occur. Actionable Insights for Investors Based on this analysis, here are some points to consider: Monitor Holder Data: Keep an eye on on-chain metrics related to long-term holder supply and accumulation trends. Watch Key Technical Levels: Identify significant support and resistance levels that could signal the start of a breakout or breakdown. Stay Informed on Macro Events: Global economic and geopolitical developments can still influence the crypto market. Consider Your Time Horizon: The current environment seems favorable for those with a longer-term perspective, aligning with holder behavior. Risk Management: As always, invest only what you can afford to lose and consider diversification. Summary: Poised for Potential? In conclusion, the current Bitcoin price analysis reveals a market in consolidation, heavily influenced by the unwavering commitment of long-term holders. This strong Bitcoin holder behavior is providing a stable base, potentially setting the stage for a significant move. While the exact timing and direction are never guaranteed, the prevailing Bitcoin market outlook , supported by the potential for catalysts in the Crypto market Q3 , suggests that a breakout is a distinct possibility. Investors formulating their BTC price prediction should weigh the strong fundamental signal from holders against potential external challenges, positioning themselves wisely for what the coming months may hold.

2025-06-18T13:16:10,"Will Universities Be Crypto’s Next Big Funding Driver?","The recent announcement that venture fund Blockchain Builders had raised $28 million to finance promising crypto start-ups turned some heads. Not because $28m is a monumental figure in the context of crypto fundraising (it isn’t), but because of the fund’s many links to Stanford University. Founded by three Stanford graduates – Gil Rosen, Kun Peng, and Steven Willinger – it’s no exaggeration to say that Blockchain Builders bloomed from the corridors of the private research university. Indeed, the phrase “Stanford blockchain ecosystem” got plenty of play when the fund launched, a reference to things like the Center for Blockchain Research, the Stanford Blockchain Accelerator, and the BASS (Blockchain Application Stanford Summit) conference series. So, what does all of this mean? Why should we care that Stanford’s become a hub of blockchain research and innovation, and that the endeavors of its crypto community have led to the creation of a seven-figure fundraising chest? From Bold Visions to Real-World Applications Well, for starters, the very fact that one of the world’s most respected research institutions is turning its gaze to blockchain is a boon for the Web3 space. Between entrepreneurship courses and accelerators, Stanford is turning into a pipeline for crypto innovation. It also represents a proving ground for university involvement in the industry, giving rise to the possibility of prominent education institutions investing in Web3 firms and tech directly. In fact, reference has already been made to expansion of this nature: while the $28m chest was dubbed Fund I, and dedicated to investing in pre-seed and seed-stage blockchain ventures mostly focused on Stanford’s community, Fund II will support the new IC3-Cornell Blockchain Accelerator , “an initiative designed to transform bold ideas into real-world applications.” Interestingly, this research-driven program includes faculty members of Carnegie Mellon, Berkeley, Princeton, Yale, and University College London (UCL). In other words, some of the brightest minds in the university system are collaborating on developing blockchain-based solutions; on taking proof-of-concepts to the real world. Given academic institutions are already accustomed to deploying capital for various initiatives, it’s not a stretch to imagine them leveraging their talent pool and deep pockets to finance the next wave of Web3 innovation. We can only guess at how impactful this might be, though Blockchain Builders itself has already funded some exciting cutting-edge projects, from decentralized AI operating system 0g (co-founded by Stanford graduate students Michael Heinrich and Thomas Yao) to Nexus Labs, a decentralized network for verifiable cloud computing created by Stanford graduate Daniel Marin. The Institutions Have Arrived Institutional funding, of course, is already pushing the crypto industry forward: inflows from tradfi investors have poured into bitcoin and ether since the approval of spot ETFs last year. Market participants previously immune to crypto’s charms are now making digital assets a fixture of their portfolios. Meanwhile, the SEC is sifting through dozens of altcoin ETF applications. Last month, BTC funds attracted a net $5.5 billion while ETH funds posted a net $890 million per Coinshares data . All told, the value of crypto fund assets hit $167 billion in May, a sure sign that the industry is breaking new ground. Academic research into blockchain is one thing, but if the growth of the Stanford crypto ecosystem is any indication, initiatives with a financial focus could be the industry’s next major funding driver. Particularly if the richest Ivy League universities are behind them. Just as the arrival of ETFs legitimized digital assets in the eyes of many, the increased involvement of august institutions like Stanford and their scholars has strengthened their appeal.

2025-06-18T13:11:38,"Russian Authorities Bust Massive $700K-a-Year Illegal Crypto Mining Farm Hidden as Industrial Plant","Authorities in Russia have dismantled a large-scale illegal crypto mining operation in Nazarovo, a town in Krasnoyarsk Krai, exposing a scheme that reportedly generated over 4.6 million rubles ($58,000) per month. According to the post on Telegram by the Krasnoyarsk Krai Prosecutor’s Office, the mining farm was operating in plain sight. It was located on a 30,000-square-meter plot of state-owned land, registered on paper as hosting a non-residential building. In reality, no such structure existed. Russian Authorities Shut Down Unpermitted Mining Site Amid Grid Overload Fears The site, surrounded by barbed wire, was packed with mining rigs and power infrastructure. Prosecutors revealed that all equipment had been leased to a third party under the pretense of renting space in the non-existent building. The company behind the operation had no right to use the land and never obtained necessary permits. Making matters worse, the miners had connected directly to the town’s power grid without approval. The unauthorized use of electricity raised risks of outages and safety hazards. Local energy officials warned of a high probability of emergency blackouts. Authorities also cited fire safety violations and a failure to comply with public safety standards. Despite a warning from prosecutors, the company continued operations. A court has since ordered the immediate suspension of the facility. The prosecutor’s office is monitoring enforcement. The shutdown adds to growing concerns over illegal crypto mining in Russia, even as the country continues to embrace the sector legally. In 2023, Russia legalized mining and introduced a taxation framework expected to generate billions of rubles annually. However, due to power constraints, mining has been restricted in certain Siberian regions , including parts of Krasnoyarsk. While legal in most of Russia, many operators avoid registration and high electricity costs by tapping directly into the grid or using residential rates. These tactics can damage infrastructure and endanger communities. Russia's power grid took a $14M hit from illegal #CryptoMining in 2024. Authorities crack down on unauthorized operations, imposing bans & stricter regulations. #Blockchain #Russia https://t.co/DDxLOdJIVE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 18, 2025 Earlier this year, an energy company employee in Krasnoyarsk was caught accepting bribes to overlook similar illegal mining connections. In that case, miners reportedly stole electricity worth over 9 million rubles ($119,000). Russia Battles Mining Thefts and Crypto Malware Attacks Elsewhere, in Russia’s Republic of Buryatia, a separate operation was discovered just days ago. During a routine inspection on June 14, authorities found 95 mining rigs hidden inside a KamAZ truck, connected to a 10-kilovolt line meant to power a nearby village.

According to Rosseti Siberia’s Buryatenergo unit, this was the sixth mining-related electricity theft in the region since January. Officials say such operations risk damaging local grids and triggering blackouts. Crypto mining is banned in most of Buryatia between November 15 and March 15 to conserve power during the winter. Only registered entities in certain districts can operate outside that window. The crackdown reflects wider federal action. In late 2024, the Russian government prohibited mining during peak energy periods in several regions, including Dagestan, Chechnya, and areas of eastern Ukraine under Russian control. Since April, a full ban has been in place in Irkutsk , one of Russia’s top mining hubs. Companies like BitRiver, which operates major data centers in Irkutsk, are heavily affected by the changes . The region hosts some of Russia’s cheapest electricity and has become central to the country’s mining industry. However, a recent r eport has surfaced that a sophisticated hacking group has been turning Russian business computers into hidden crypto mining machines while stealing sensitive financial data, according to a new report by Kaspersky. The group, known as Librarian Ghouls (also called Rare Werewolf or Rezet), has been conducting a dual-purpose attack that installs unauthorized Monero mining software and extracts cryptocurrency wallet credentials and private keys. The campaign, active through May 2025, has primarily targeted industrial firms and engineering schools across Russia and the CIS region.

There is a surge of bitcoin treasury companies that focus on accumulating bitcoin and following strategies similar to Strategy. Although the Prenetics acquisition is small by comparison to firms spending hundreds of millions of dollars on BTC, the firm said it has board approval to substantially increase its bitcoin holdings and aims to become one of the largest healthcare corporate bitcoin holders globally, in a press statement on Wednesday. “What excites me most is not just Bitcoin as a treasury asset, but the convergence we're witnessing between healthcare innovation and blockchain technology,” said Danny Yeung, CEO of Prenetics. “We're at the dawn of a new era where genomics, personalized medicine, and digital assets will intersect in ways that could revolutionize how we approach human health, longevity and wealth.” Earlier this week, H100 Group (H100), a Swedish health-technology company, announced a 750 million kronor ($79 million) transaction to support its long-term bitcoin BTC treasury strategy. Prenetics also announced the appointment of Andy Cheung, former COO of OKEx, to its Board of Directors.

2025-06-18T12:56:16,"Ethereum price outlook: $3,200 or $1,587 as 39-day range nears breakout","Ethereum has now traded in a tight range for over a month, with neither bulls nor bears taking full control. As price compresses and volatility stalls, the setup becomes increasingly primed for a strong directional move, but which way will it break? For the past 39 days, Ethereum ( ETH ) has been locked between two critical high time frame levels, with price action failing to produce a definitive trend. This prolonged consolidation signals one of two potential outcomes: an accumulation phase before continuation higher, or a distribution phase that leads to a breakdown and deeper correction. Key technical points: Range Duration: Ethereum has been range-bound for 39 days. Key Support: $2,400 (confluence of high time frame structure, moving averages, and POC). Key Resistance: $2,870 high time frame resistance. Bullish Breakout Target: Above $2,870 toward $3,200+. Bearish Breakdown Target: Loss of $2,400 opens a path to $1,587. ETHUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView At present, Ethereum is holding above the $2,400 mark, a critical support zone. This level carries significant technical confluence: it aligns with the current point of control (the highest traded volume area within this range), long-term moving averages, and past support levels. As long as Ethereum continues to close above this zone, the bullish case remains slightly favored, with the potential for a move above the $2,870 resistance. A breakout above that level would likely confirm the consolidation as accumulation, potentially triggering a rally into the low $3,000s. You might also like: BlackRock buys $1.4B Bitcoin over six-day streak amid ETF boom However, if $2,400 is lost, the bearish scenario takes precedence. A sustained breakdown below this key support would shift structure decisively in favor of the bears and open the door to a move toward the next major support around $1,587, a level last visited during prior market corrections. Importantly, price action currently sits in what can best be described as no man’s land, neither clearly bullish nor bearish. The consolidation continues, and the market awaits either a surge in volume or a catalyst to resolve this range. Traders must remain patient and let the market reveal its direction. What to expect in the coming price action Ethereum remains in a tightly coiled structure, with neither side asserting dominance. Until the $2,400 support is lost or the $2,870 resistance is broken, this range is expected to persist. Traders should wait for a confirmed breakout or breakdown before committing to directional positions.

In the meantime, BTC’s price continues to feel the consequences of yet another global turmoil as it fell below $105,000 earlier today. As reported yesterday, the POTUS made some critical remarks on the Iran-Israel conflict, indicating that the US intelligence knew where Tehran’s Supreme Leader hid. Trump called Khamenei an “easy target,” but said he is safe for now. However, the US President demanded that Iran surrender unconditionally. Cited by several media outlets, Khamenei refused Trump’s proposition, saying that his country will not surrender. Moreover, Iran’s Supreme Leader warned that there will be “irreparable harm” if the US further backs Israel and joins the attacks. A White House official confirmed yesterday that Trump and Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, spoke on the phone while the US continues to build up military forces in the region. In the past few days alone, the US has sent a third Navy destroyer in the Mediterranean Sea, and a second carrier strike group is heading toward the Arabian Sea. So far, though, the Pentagon has denied that these moves are anything more than “purely defensive” operations. Bitcoin’s price slumped yesterday after Trump’s statement, and has failed to stage a meaningful recovery. It’s unlikely to do so in the near term as the tension in the Middle East continues to escalate. BTCUSD.

2025-06-18T12:30:27,"How Low Can Cardano Go? Analyst Maps Final Crash Before Resolution","After more than five weeks of unrelenting downside pressure, Cardano (ADA) finds itself approaching a potentially decisive juncture. In a new analysis published June 18, crypto analyst Quantum Ascend (@quantum_ascend) offered a fresh take on ADA’s price structure, warning that the final leg of a downward five-wave Elliott pattern may now be unfolding—with a critical resolution point drawing near. How Low Can Cardano Crash? “We dropped down into that second wave… and had it highlighted, it bounced from there. So we did call that correctly,” the analyst began, referencing earlier predictions. But despite the brief bounce, he now sees a more extended impulse playing out. “It does look like we’re turning this into more of a five-wave move down. So one, two, three, four, and working on a fifth wave now,” he explained while analyzing the one-day chart of ADA. Related Reading: Whales Dump Over 270 Million Cardano In One Week – Bearish Signal Or Shakeout? At the core of the bearish outlook is Fibonacci confluence. Quantum Ascend pointed out that ADA currently hovers around the 0.702 retracement level, with the 0.786 level lying just beneath it—both key zones often associated with deeper corrections in Elliott Wave theory. “Makes complete sense for us to go ahead and drop in right to this area at the very minimum,” he noted. Yet despite the grim technicals, the analyst maintains that no structural damage has occurred—at least not yet. “As long as we hold the 51 cent level, nothing’s broken, it’s not a problem, right?” he reassured. The broader context, however, is less encouraging: “We need Bitcoin to catch a little bit of a bid or Ethereum or something. We need some kind of good news to come in to alleviate a little bit of this because the market’s just pretty much been bleeding… for over a month now.” ADA has underperformed relative to its peers since early May, with sentiment sliding alongside price. But Quantum Ascend encouraged viewers not to overreact to the current downtrend. “All it is is an opportunity to dollar cost average,” he said, before addressing the exhaustion many long-term holders are feeling. “I know what you’re saying, QA. I’ve been dollar cost averaging for seven months. I get it. I’ve been there.” Related Reading: Nasdaq Says Yes To Cardano: ADA Earns A Spot Among Crypto Giants Rather than panic-sell or obsess over day-to-day moves, the analyst recommended mental distance and patience. “Go do something fun, it’s beautiful, it’s summer. Go do something else, anything else. But this thing is gonna resolve itself and alt season is around the corner,” he said. Despite short-term bearishness in the chart, his long-term conviction remains intact. “World War III is not starting. I could not have more conviction in all those things.” With ADA potentially entering the final leg of a corrective structure and broader markets searching for a catalyst, all eyes are now on whether support zones hold—or if Cardano is headed even lower before the long-awaited resolution finally arrives. At press time, ADA traded at $0.6158.

Despite recent institutional inflows into ETFs, overall sentiment remains fragile, with volatility expected to persist in the near term.

2025-06-18T12:27:04,"Crypto Price Analysis 6-18: BITCOIN: BTC, ETHEREUM: ETH, SOLANA: SOL, UNISWAP: UNI, CELESTIA: TIA, BITTENSOR: TAO","The crypto market registered a substantial drop as markets turned bearish after Bitcoin (BTC) , and most cryptocurrencies retreated as geopolitical tensions intensified. The upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision also impacted market sentiment. BTC dipped to a low of $103,567 as selling pressure intensified. However, the flagship cryptocurrency has recovered to reclaim $105,000 and move to current levels. BTC is down nearly 2% over the past 24 hours, trading around $105,490. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) is down nearly 2%, trading around $2,538 as it struggles to stay above $2,500. Ripple (XRP) is down over 3%, and Solana (SOL) fell below the $150 mark after dropping nearly 4%, trading around $148. Dogecoin (DOGE) is also trading in the red, with the price down 1.30%, while Cardano (ADA) is down 2.32%, trading around $0.618. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Toncoin (TON) , Litecoin (LTC) , Hedera (HBAR) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable declines. Dow Jones Down As Swift End To Israel-Iran Conflict Ruled Out The Dow Jones and other US stock indices fell as hopes for a quick resolution to the Israel-Iran conflict faded. The Dow Jones fell 130 points on July 17, with healthcare firms leading the decline. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 dropped 0.44% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.50%. The market downturn began after US President Donald Trump called for the evacuation of Iran’s capital, Tehran, signaling an escalation of the conflict. President Trump has taken a hardline stance on Iran’s nuclear disarmament instead of pushing for a ceasefire, a demand the country is likely to reject. Oil prices have also spiked 3%, with investors worried a prolonged conflict could impact the region’s oil production, supply, and trade. Israel has already attacked major oil facilities in Iran, with the latter considering a closure of the Strait of Hormuz. Market watchers believe a prolonged conflict could prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates sooner than expected. BBVA Suggests Clients Make Crypto Allocations BBVA (Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria), Spain’s second-largest bank, has advised its affluent clients to invest in crypto. The bank told its clients to invest between 3% and 7% of their portfolio into crypto and Bitcoin (BTC) , depending on their desired risk exposure. Philippe Meyer, the head of digital and blockchain solutions at BBVA Switzerland, stated at a conference in London, “With private customers, since September last year, we started advising on Bitcoin.” He also stated that portfolio allocation has been increased to accommodate riskier profiles. Meyers claimed the bank’s clients have been receptive to its advice and dismissed concerns that BTC and other crypto assets were too risky. “If you look at a balanced portfolio, if you introduce 3%, you already boost the performance. At 3%, you are not taking a huge risk.” The bank’s push comes amid growing warnings from European Union regulators and its central bank about the risks involved in cryptocurrencies. 95% of banks operating in the European Union are avoiding crypto. Thailand To Exempt Capital Gains Tax On Crypto For Five Years Thailand has announced it will exempt capital gains taxes on cryptocurrency sales through locally licensed crypto asset service providers for five years. The Ministry of Finance confirmed the announcement on Tuesday, stating that capital gains taxes will be waived on crypto transactions between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2029. The decision comes after Vietnam introduced legislation to define cryptocurrencies legally. The new legislation will come into effect on January 1, 2026. Thailand is not the first country to offer crypto investors a tax incentive. Several jurisdictions, including the Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands, Vanuatu, and the Bahamas, already have zero capital gains tax on crypto. Singapore, Malaysia, and the UAE also impose zero capital gains tax on investors. Tax residents in European countries like Germany and Portugal can also avoid capital gains entirely if they hold their assets for a year. US Senate Passes GENIUS Act The US Senate passed the GENIUS Act, clearing the way for the creation of a regulatory framework for US dollar-pegged crypto-tokens known as stablecoins. The bill received bipartisan support, with several Democrats joining the Republicans to back the bill. As a result, it passed the Senate with a 68-30 vote. The bill must pass the House of Representatives before it heads to President Donald Trump for approval. Andrew Olmen, a managing partner at Mayer Brown, called the bill’s passage a major milestone, stating, “It is a major milestone. It establishes, for the first time, a regulatory regime for stablecoins, a rapidly developing financial product and industry.” If signed into law, the bill will mandate all stablecoins to be backed by liquid assets like the US Dollar and short-term Treasury Bills. Stablecoin issuers will also be required to disclose the composition of their reserves. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has rebounded during the ongoing session, with the price up nearly 1%. The flagship cryptocurrency has reclaimed $105,000 after registering significant declines on Monday and Tuesday as market sentiment worsened thanks to escalating tensions in the Middle East. BTC saw a sharp drop on Monday as markets turned bearish after reports emerged that President Donald Trump had called his advisors to the Situation Room. Tensions in the Middle East have escalated further, with President Trump leaving the G7 summit early and requesting the National Security Council meet in the White House Situation Room. Trump posted a chilling message on Truth Social after leaving the G7 summit, asking everyone to evacuate Tehran. US Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Trump’s departure due to the escalating Middle East conflict. “Much was accomplished, but because of what’s going on in the Middle East, President Trump will be leaving tonight after dinner with Heads of State.” Price action remained bearish on Tuesday as hopes of a quick resolution to the conflict evaporated. The Federal Reserve’s impending decision on rate cuts has also impacted investor sentiment. As a result, crypto liquidations have also surged by 25% in the past 24 hours to nearly $360 million. Markets were further spooked after two oil tankers collided and caught fire in the Strait of Hormuz, a critical area that sees millions of oil barrels pass daily. As a result, oil prices spiked, rising over 2%. Bitfinex analysts believe BTC must hold above $102,000 to stay on course for a potential rebound. According to the analysts, while BTC still risks falling further, if it stays above $102,000, it would suggest markets are absorbing the selling pressure effectively. However, downside risk lingers thanks to macroeconomic volatility and tensions between Israel and Iran. However, the market situation also presents investors with a high-stakes yet potentially rewarding opportunity for investors. Crypto trader Matthew Hyland stated on X, “This environment now reflects a high-risk, high-reward opportunity for upside continuation if buyer confidence returns.” Markets were optimistic about BTC testing its all-time high after it surged past $110,000 last week. However, those hopes were dashed after Israel carried out airstrikes on Iran. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs continued to see strong inflows despite market uncertainty. BTC entered the previous weekend on a bullish note, surging nearly 3% to settle at $104,378. Buyers retained control over the weekend as the price rose $1.15% on Saturday and registered a marginal increase on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,784. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as BTC surged over 4% to cross the 20-day SMA and $110,000 and settle at $110,251. The price fell to an intraday low of $108,335 on Tuesday but recovered to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,253. Sentiment turned negative on Wednesday as BTC fell 1.42%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at $108,687.

Solana coin price could reach a potential high of $400 in 2025. With a potential surge, the SOL price could hit $1,351 by 2030. Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer,” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. In a recent feat, Solana Strategies has planned to raise $1 billion to boost the ecosystem. Talking about numbers, the Solana price currently trades at a discount of 50.24% from its ATH of $ 294.33. Following this, crypto investors are storming Google with questions like “Will Solana Go Back Up?” or “How high can Solana go?” and “Will SOL price reach $500 this altcoin season?” To answer more such questions, we bring to you our Solana price prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030. We’ll address these queries using our analyses, market sentiments, and regular updates from the crypto world. Table of contents Solana Price Today Solana Price Prediction for June 2025 Solana (SOL) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Solana Price Forecast 2026 SOL Price Analysis 2027 Solana Coin Price Prediction 2028 SOL Coin Price Prediction 2029 Solana Price Prediction 2030 Solana (SOL) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis FAQs Solana Price Today Cryptocurrency Solana Token SOL Price $ 145.28307516 -2.86% Market cap $ 76,690,831,903.5714 Circulating Supply 527,871,755.3253 Trading Volume $ 3,773,385,851.6118 All-time high $294.33 on 19th January 2025 All-time low $0.5052 on 12th May 2020 Solana Price Prediction for June 2025 SOL crypto price is now hovering around $146.40, after reclaiming the Bollinger Band midpoint, with support at $140 being held firm. The RSI near 40.12 hints at the lack of strong momentum for a recovery. It is worth mentioning that a breakout above $170 could trigger a rally toward the $185 to $190 resistance zone. However, a failure to hold above $150 may floor the price to $140. That being said, Solana crypto is likely to trade sideways with an inclination to the bulls until the next fortnight. Potential High: $190 Average Price Range: $165 Potential Low: $140 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the derivatives market with $6.56B in open interest, far surpassing other altcoins. The heatmap and high trader positioning signal elevated volatility ahead. Any major price move in SOL could trigger significant market reactions, making it a key token to watch in the coming sessions. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

On the same day as its latest BTC purchase, IBIT recorded approximately $639.2 million in net inflows, even as other major issuers like Fidelity, ARK, and Bitwise posted significant outflows. The strong influx of funds and steady buying also follow a major milestone for IBIT, which recently became the fastest exchange-traded fund in history to surpass $70 billion in assets under management (AUM). The fund reached that mark in just 341 days, crushing the previous record of 1,691 days set by the SPDR Gold Shares ETF.

Key Takeaways: K33 is raising at least $9 million to buy Bitcoin and strengthen its balance sheet. The firm aims to reach a 1,000 BTC target as part of its broader treasury strategy. Direct Bitcoin holdings are expected to boost K33’s margins and attract institutional clients. The offering, managed by Pareto Securities AS, sets the share price at SEK 0.1036 and allows for an open-ended raise beyond the minimum amount, according to a Wednesday press release . The move is part of K33’s broader strategy to solidify its financial foundation and gain long-term exposure to Bitcoin, while enhancing its operational strength as a brokerage platform. K33 Advances Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy After May 28 Disclosure K33’s initiative follows a May 28 announcement detailing a dedicated BTC accumulation strategy. By holding Bitcoin directly, the firm aims to unlock operational leverage that would improve profit margins, enable new product lines, and bolster appeal to institutional partners. The company believes this approach will fuel scalable growth without exposing the acquired BTC to risk. The directed share issue offers quick access to capital, allowing K33 to respond swiftly to favorable market opportunities while bringing in strategically aligned investors. CEO Torbjørn Bull Jenssen said that the financing round marks a major step toward the company’s near-term target of acquiring 1,000 BTC. “We strongly believe that Bitcoin represents the future of global finance and are positioning K33 to benefit maximally from this,” said Jenssen. “A strong balance sheet built on Bitcoin enables us to significantly improve our brokerage operation while maintaining full exposure to Bitcoin’s upside potential.” The company has not set an upper limit for the raise, giving it flexibility to expand its BTC reserves further should demand from investors allow. The board retains the discretion to introduce a maximum offer size at a later stage.

VanEck Warns BTC Treasury Strategy May Backfire Just recently, VanEck’s head of digital asset research, Matthew Sigel, raised concerns about the Bitcoin treasury strategies used by certain public companies, suggesting that continued accumulation of BTC could soon harm shareholders more than help. He specifically criticized the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, warning that they can become dilutive when stock prices approach the company’s Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). Sigel proposed several measures to prevent value erosion, including pausing ATM programs if a company’s stock trades below 0.95x NAV for over 10 days. He drew comparisons to past failures in the crypto mining sector, where excessive dilution and executive pay led to major shareholder losses. As an example, he cited Semler Scientific, a medical tech firm that entered the BTC space in 2024. Despite acquiring 3,808 BTC, its stock has fallen over 45%, and its mNAV has dropped to 0.82x.

Key Takeaways: ARK Invest has sold nearly $100 million worth of Circle shares in just two days. The firm’s divestment now totals over 640,000 shares, or 14% of its original stake. Despite bullish legislation, Circle’s stock dipped as ARK remained the only major backer reducing exposure. The move brings its two-day total to nearly $100 million, raising questions about the investment firm’s confidence in the USDC stablecoin issuer and the broader crypto market amid worsening geopolitical tensions. Previously, the firm sold 342,658 shares of Circle on Monday, valued at roughly $51.7 million. ARK Invest Sells 300K Circle Shares Across Three Flagship ETFs According to trade notifications , ARK sold 300,108 shares across its three major ETFs — ARK Innovation (ARKK), Next Generation Internet (ARKW), and Fintech Innovation (ARKF). ARKK accounted for the largest sale with over 208,000 shares, while ARKW and ARKF offloaded smaller portions. The timing of the sale came as Circle’s stock fell 1.3% on the day, closing at $149 after briefly trading above $165 the day prior. That drop followed the Senate’s passage of the GENIUS stablecoin bill , a legislative win that many expected to support the stablecoin industry. So far, ARK is the only major Circle investor to significantly reduce exposure post-IPO. Other backers, including BlackRock, reportedly eyeing a 10% stake in the company, have not disclosed any sales.

This brings the company’s total holdings to a total of 1,653 BTC. In an official press release , The Blockchain Group declared that it has acquired a combined total of 182 BTC ( BTC ) in the time period from May 26 to June 12. Most of the proceedings used to buy more Bitcoin came from the completion of the company’s recent convertible bond issuance, amounting to approximately $19.6 million. The Blockchain Group’s latest purchase brings its total Bitcoin holdings to 1,653 BTC. Not only that, the company also declared that its generated BTC yield from its holdings has jumped 1,173% this year. After the recent purchase, the company added that there still exists one subscription left from its previous shares issuance that has not been redeemed yet. The subscription was made by TOBAM and Adam Back, and is worth around $7.31 million, which could be used to purchase another 70 BTC.

2025-06-18T12:07:43,"Bitcoin Retests 50-Day Average Support; XRP Risks Dogecoin-Like Bearish Shift in Momentum","This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. There is an old saying, ""Once is a chance, twice is a coincidence, and a third time is a trend."" It applies to bitcoin BTC right now. The cryptocurrency's price has fallen back to its 50-day simple moving average (SMA), which offered support on two occasions this month, leading to price bounces. Therefore, the latest re-test of the average presents an opportunity for the bulls to establish a trend in which the 50-day SMA powers new legs higher. Conversely, the fall of the 50-day SMA support could invite stronger selling pressure, potentially leading to a dip below $100,000. At press time, the bear case appears strong due to signs of bull fatigue, as evident from the recent shallow bounces from the 50-day SMA. The first test of the average on June 5 produced a bounce from roughly $100,500 to over $10,000. However, the second test of the SMA on June 17 saw prices bounce only from $103,000 to $109,000. The past week's Doji candle also suggests bull fatigue above $100,000. A high-volume move above $110,000 is needed to restore the immediate bullish outlook. XRP headed the DOGE way? Payments-focused cryptocurrency XRP XRP is trading at the lower end of the Ichimoku cloud, a momentum indicator based on several moving average variants and developed by a Japanese journalist in the 1960s. Crossovers above and below the cloud are said to represent bullish and bearish shifts in momentum. When an asset's price crosses below the cloud, as dogecoin DOGE did early this month, it typically signals a bearish trend. Traders often interpret this as a signal to consider selling or shorting the asset, especially if other macro or technical indicators confirm the signal. XRP's 50-day SMA has already crossed below the 200-day SMA to confirm the so-called death cross, a bearish indicator. Therefore, a potential move below the Ichimoku cloud could prove costly for the bears, potentially opening the door for a slide below $2. On the charts, support is seen directly at $ 1.60, the early April low. Coins like DOGE, ADA, and LINK have dropped below their respective Ichimoku clouds in recent days, resulting in price losses.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/18/bitcoin-retests-50-day-average-support-xrp-risks-dogecoin-like-bearish-shift-in-momentum,"BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Markets|XRP|Bitcoin|Technical Analysis|Markets|market analysis|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-18T12:05:53,"PI coin tests new lows as trading volume dips and CEX supply spike add pressure","The supply of Pi Network (PI) tokens held on centralized exchanges (CEXs) has surged more than 30% over the past three months. Trading activity for the coin has also collapsed by over 90%, on-chain data shows. The contradictory metrics has prompted some analysts to warn investors of immense sell pressures and a possible downward price action. According to updated data tracked on Piscan and exchange wallet dashboards on Wednesday, the total number of Pi coins stored across exchanges has grown from 263 million in March to 345 million in mid-June 2025. As of the latest reading, CEXs now collectively hold 346.8 million PI tokens. The rise in supply is against the backdrop of a decline in trading volume, falling from over $5.4 billion weekly in May to under $500 million this week. Exchange balances rise spells sell-side risk Detailed data from several top exchanges shows that OKX, ranked fourth on CoinMarketCap, currently holds over 28.5 million PI tokens, despite having a net outflow of 741,272 PI in the last 24 hours. Bitget, which holds the second-largest volume at 118.5 million PI, also recorded a negative 24-hour net flow of 171,036 coins. PI balance on CEX wallets. Source: Piscan Gate.io, with 163.2 million PI, is the highest among the observed CEX wallets, registering a 24-hour net outflow of over half a million coins. Overall, centralized exchange wallets processed more than 8 million PI in deposits and over 9.2 million in withdrawals in the past day alone. The withdrawals resulted in a net daily outflow of 1.13 million PI from CEXs, yet the total wallet holdings are still on the rise, even as new inflows arrive faster than existing withdrawals. The cumulative dollar value of PI stored on these exchanges now stands at approximately $187.9 million. Outflows from Pi Foundation wallets rattle community On the wallet activity scan, Pi Foundation team wallet address “GBQQRIQK…HJI25” offloaded 50 million PI in the last 24 hours, the single largest outgoing transaction recorded. This transaction was not offset by any corresponding incoming flow. Another Foundation wallet, “GAB7TEMP…4GC5G” received 50 million PI and sent out approximately 6.97 million, ending the day with a net positive flow of over 43 million tokens. These internal movements could be strategic reallocations, but the sheer scale of transactions and timing relative to falling market volume has sparked chatter of impending liquidity injections into exchanges. Altogether, the Pi Foundation and its associated wallets currently hold more than 72.5 billion PI tokens, valued at over $39.3 billion. Most remain inactive, but the selective movement of millions in PI tokens is contributing to anxiety about potential oversupply and price impact. Despite the on-chain warnings and chart-based bearish signals, the Pi Network’s dedicated community, known as Pioneers, is focused on the platform’s Global Consensus Value (GCV) of $314,159. Many community members view the market exchange price as unrepresentative of Pi’s true value, choosing instead to hold their assets or transact through the in-app barter system. Still, the current sentiment is of a community frustrated with the Core Team’s lack of visible progress. Weekly trading volume for PI has shrunk by more than 90% in a single month, dropping from $5.4 billion to less than $500 million, according to CoinMarketCap. Declines in volume often precede sharp corrections, especially in markets already flooded with tokens. $Pi is trading at $0.62 and is just getting hammer down with each $BTC dip.

2025-06-18T12:03:01,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: U.S. Senate Approves Stablecoin Law — Here’s Why BTC Bulls Are Celebrating","Bitcoin (BTC) hovered around 104,450 during Wednesday’s European session, slipping from recent highs as traders braced for the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy decision and tracked escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Despite near-term selling pressure, optimism re-emerged after the U.S. Senate approved the GENIUS Act, a watershed moment for stablecoin regulation in the United States. BREAKING : US Senate just passed the Stablecoin Bill! Programmable, on-chain, 1:1 digital cash with clear rules. Massive acceleration for crypto. Next up: House ☞ Trump signs. The U.S. is about to onboard the world. Bullish is an understatement pic.twitter.com/3zpD2xwT4i — matan | eO/ACC (@matan_si) June 17, 2025 The GENIUS (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) Act passed with a 68-30 vote, making it the first federal law governing fiat-backed stablecoins. The bill enforces 1:1 reserve backing, mandatory audits, and licensing requirements for issuers. Notably, compliant stablecoins will operate outside SEC jurisdiction, a win for crypto innovation. This legal clarity is expected to encourage institutional adoption of stablecoins and create a more trusted environment for broader crypto participation. Senator Bill Hagerty praised the bill as a pivotal step toward making the U.S. the “crypto capital of the world.” Geopolitical Tensions Add Downside Risk Meanwhile, tensions in the Middle East have kept traders on the defensive. The ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel intensified following statements by former President Trump, who demanded Iran’s “unconditional surrender” in a social media post. Speculation around U.S. involvement continues to add uncertainty. GM to those who say it back! Where is Bitcoin headed in the next 12 hours? Trump has created so much uncertainty, sellers are in panic mode. Will Iran-Israel tensions send us further down? At end of day, what are your predictions for $BTC ? pic.twitter.com/ZkC6QDnNcF — Microscopic (@PayMeInSats) June 17, 2025 BTC sentiment soured on fears of wider regional escalation The market remains sensitive to any new developments in the conflict Risk-off mood has temporarily capped upside for digital assets Still, investors see the GENIUS Act as a long-term bullish catalyst, potentially offsetting some of the geopolitical drag. Fed Decision Looms, Triangle Pattern Forms for Bitcoin Later today, the Federal Reserve is expected to hold rates steady at 4.25% to 4.50%, but markets are watching for dovish clues in the accompanying forecast. A signal for rate cuts later in 2025 could weaken the dollar and support Bitcoin. Technically, Bitcoin price prediction remains bearish as BTC/USD is compressing within a symmetrical triangle on the 2-hour chart, with key resistance at 106,658 and support at 103,431. The 50-EMA has flattened at 105,807, reinforcing a period of indecision. MACD momentum has turned negative, suggesting a bearish bias until a breakout confirms direction. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Trade Setup Sell Entry: Below 103,430 Target 1: 102,180 Target 2: 100,450 Stop-Loss: Above 105,800 This structure favors a short-term bearish play unless BTC decisively breaks above the upper trendline. Watch for a confirmed candle close outside the triangle with substantial volume before acting. As macro headlines and regulatory shifts collide, Bitcoin traders are watching closely—and preparing for volatility. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.2M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With BTC trading near $105K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,233,406 out of its $8,290,897 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.00257 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 58% APY staking pool holding over 1.81 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income. With just hours left and the hard cap nearly reached, momentum is building fast. BTCBULL ’s blend of Bitcoin-linked value, scarcity mechanics, and flexible staking is fueling strong demand. Early buyers have a limited time to enter before the next pricing tier activates.
