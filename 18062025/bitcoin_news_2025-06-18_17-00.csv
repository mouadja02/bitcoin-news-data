2025-06-18T14:55:48,"Trump’s Truth Social Eyes SEC Nod for BTC-ETH ETF Launch","Donald Trump's Truth Social website has once again made headlines, this time filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list a first-ever dual Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). The new fund, supported by Yorkville America Digital, aims to give investors exposure to BTC and ETH in a single regulated product—a daring move that comes just months before the 2025 presidential election and when crypto policy just so happens to be a hot campaign issue. In the Dual-Asset ETF Structure Unlike the single-asset ETFs that have dominated U.S. markets since 2024, the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF would allocate 75% of its investments to Bitcoin and 25% to Ether, according to the S-1 filing. The fund's shares would be directly supported by BTC and ETH held in custody with Foris DAX Trust Company, doing business as Crypto.com. This product aims to simplify access for traditional investors, allowing them to diversify between the two largest cryptocurrencies without having to handle individual products or wallets. The ETF will trade on NYSE Arca, though the final ticker and cash custodian details are not yet known. Truth Social's filing also indicates that it plans to file further amendments, including a summary of its agency agreement with Crypto.com, which will also be providing trading execution, staking, and liquidity services for the fund. Election-Year Tailwinds and Political Calculus The timing of the filing is not coincidental. Trump Media's ETF attempt follows the SEC's approval of a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury plan for the firm, and as Trump himself has focused crypto in his campaign messaging. By leveraging the Truth Social brand and user base, the ETF could potentially attract a politically engaged retail group and help to further establish Trump as a crypto-friendly candidate. Analysts add that the ETF's launch could serve as a rallying point for crypto-friendly voters, especially with the Biden administration coming under criticism for regulatory uncertainty in the space. The move also comes as other issuers, including BlackRock and Fidelity, still dominate the single-asset ETF space, with Truth Social's dual-asset approach being a differentiation. How It Compares to Single-Asset Funds Most U.S. crypto ETFs are focused exclusively on Bitcoin or, more recently, Ethereum. Truth Social's product is unique in that it offers both assets under the same roof, which could appeal to investors seeking diversification without the burden of holding multiple funds. While the SEC has already approved several dual-asset ETFs, like the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF, none have been paired with a high-profile political brand or social media site. The twin structure would also have a tendency to smooth out volatility as Bitcoin and Ether move in tandem but can decouple during periods of market stress or protocol upgrades. The fund's direct custody model, with Crypto.com as the trusted provider, is designed to provide assurance to investors of asset security—an issue that has dogged some earlier ETF launches. Will the SEC Say Yes? Legal professionals state that the chances of approval are higher than they would've been a year ago, due to the SEC's recent approvals of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Nevertheless, the Truth Social ETF's prominent political affiliations and twin-asset structure may attract additional attention. Some analysts caution that possible conflicts of interest—due to Trump's ownership in both the media firm and the ETF sponsor—may be a point of contention during the SEC's review process. However, the regulatory winds appear to be shifting. The SEC has been willing to approve new crypto products, provided they have robust transparency and surveillance mechanisms in place. The involvement of well-established partners like Yorkville America Digital and Crypto.com could also serve to reinforce the ETF's bid. “Given the SEC’s recent approvals, a dual Bitcoin-Ether ETF now has a real shot—especially in an election year where crypto is front and center,” — ETF legal analyst, June 2025 What's Next for Truth Social's ETF Bid? With the S-1 filed and the NYSE Arca listing application pending, the SEC's court now has the ball. Barring approval, the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF could launch as soon as Q4 2025 into a growing crypto investment product market. Meanwhile, both investors and political pundits will be monitoring the SEC's next step—and the potential ripple effects on both the crypto markets and the campaign trail. The Bottom Line Truth Social's double bid for Bitcoin and Ether ETFs is a gamble that combines political branding with financial innovation. With the SEC ruling, the outcome could set a precedent for both crypto regulation and the intersection of digital assets with U.S. politics.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9615/trump-s-truth-social-eyes-sec-nod-for-btc-eth-etf-launch,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Business",cryptocompare
2025-06-18T14:54:30,"Shanghai’s new e-CNY hub marks China’s subtle play for global monetary influence","Shanghai’s new e-CNY operations center is China’s answer to the stablecoin-led disruption of cross-border finance, signaling that the digital yuan isn’t just for domestic trials anymore, but for an open audition on the global economic stage. On June 18, People’s Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng took the stage at Shanghai’s Lujiazui Forum to unveil what may become the digital yuan’s most consequential maneuver yet. Among eight sweeping reforms, the establishment of an e-CNY international operations center stood out, designed to pilot blockchain-based trade finance tools and streamline cross-border settlements. Pan was deliberate in his speech . While acknowledging that stablecoins and CBDCs are “reshaping traditional payment infrastructure,” he positioned the digital yuan as something distinct: a state-backed alternative that leverages blockchain’s efficiency while rejecting its decentralization ethos. You might also like: GENIUS Act could bring trillions in institutional crypto capital: experts weigh in From domestic trials to global playbook The establishment of Shanghai’s international e-CNY hub is more than just a pilot program. It marks China recalibrating its digital currency strategy in the face of slowing domestic traction and a shifting global financial order. Despite four years of pilots across 29 cities, the digital yuan remains a niche product within China’s vast payment ecosystem. As of mid-2025, e-CNY transactions accounted for just 0.16% of China’s total payment volume, dwarfed by Alipay and WeChat Pay, which dominate daily commerce. Even state-backed incentives, like expiring cash airdrops to spur usage, have failed to shift consumer habits. Yet, Beijing isn’t retreating, it’s pivoting. China views CBDCs as a long-term infrastructure play, not a quick retail win. The Shanghai hub signals a shift in focus from convincing street vendors to accept e-CNY to rewriting the rules of cross-border trade finance. In his speech, Pan tied the digital yuan to a broader vision of monetary multipolarity, where no single currency dominates global trade and finance: “The development of the international monetary system towards multipolarity will help promote sovereign currency countries to strengthen policy constraints, enhance the resilience of the international monetary system, and more effectively maintain global economic and financial stability.” Pan said in a translated statement. The governor made clear this isn’t just about currency politics. He emphasized how emerging technologies enable faster payment settlements. By integrating smart contracts into cross-border transactions, China aims to harness blockchain’s speed while maintaining centralized oversight. This hybrid approach targets stablecoins’ core appeal, instant settlements, while rejecting what Pan described as their “insufficient regulatory oversight.” The gamble? That developing economies will trade crypto’s openness for China’s promise of dollar-free, real-time infrastructure.

Table of Contents Retail vs. institutional: Diverging strategies Neo Pepe sparks retail excitement with strategic presale momentum Crypto craze unmasks Neo Pepe: An honest take to heed Neo Pepe’s path to rapid returns Ready to escape memetrix’s hold? Some leading market analysts forecast Bitcoin soaring to an impressive $600,000 by October 2025, emphasizing robust long-term institutional confidence. Veteran Wall Street analyst Fred Krueger highlights significant bullish indicators, including the U.S. government’s proposed Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and steadily increasing institutional adoption. Furthermore, Larry Fink, CEO of global investment giant BlackRock, has made even more ambitious forecasts, suggesting Bitcoin could reach valuations as high as $700,000, particularly due to potential sovereign wealth fund allocations ranging from 2–5% into cryptocurrencies. Analysts from well-respected institutions like Unchained and Binance concur, projecting valuations between $250,000 and $600,000 within the same timeframe, underlining Bitcoin’s growing role as a digital store of value and economic hedge. Yet, while Bitcoin ’s institutional future appears promising, retail investors have been actively seeking alternative cryptocurrency projects that offer immediate and substantial returns.

2025-06-18T14:43:09,"Trump's Tariff Resist Has Brought Results! Chinese Mining Equipment Manufacturers Have Started Moving Their Production Facilities to the US! Here Are the Detail...","The world's three largest manufacturers of Bitcoin mining devices, Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT, have begun setting up production facilities in the United States. Chinese Bitcoin Mining Giants Begin Production in the US: Strategic Move Against Tax Walls This move stands out as a defensive strategy against the high tariffs imposed on China by former US President Donald Trump as part of the trade war. The three companies together produce more than 90% of global bitcoin mining equipment. While moving to the U.S. could shield them from additional tariffs, it could also trigger U.S. security concerns over China over issues such as chip production and energy security. Bitmain began production in the US in December, a month after Trump’s election victory, while Canaan announced that it had begun trial production in the US, taking the step following Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs announced on April 2. MicroBT said in a statement that it was “actively implementing its localization strategy” in the US and aimed to avoid the impact of tariffs. Describing these developments as “not a superficial but a structural supply chain transformation,” Conflux Network CTO Guang Yang said that U.S. companies have adopted this move as a strategy not only to avoid tariffs but also to “move toward politically acceptable hardware sources.” While more than 30% of global Bitcoin mining is done in North America, more than 90% of the hardware still comes from China. That imbalance has particularly spurred action from firms such as U.S. rival Auradine, whose chief strategy officer, Sanjay Gupta, has argued that having hundreds of thousands of Chinese-made mining rigs connected to the U.S. power grid poses a national security risk. Even though China banned cryptocurrency activities in 2021, companies like Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT maintained their leadership in the industry thanks to their credentials as hardware manufacturers. Their first-mover advantage, especially in developing high-performance, mining-specific chips, put them ahead of Western competitors. Canaan moved its headquarters to Singapore and set up a trial production line in the US. The US market accounts for 40% of the company’s revenue. “Our goal is to reduce costs for both us and our customers,” said Vice President Leo Wang. Trump’s promise to be a “crypto president” and his son Eric Trump’s American Bitcoin initiative, which he founded with Hut 8, show that the US attaches strategic importance to bitcoin. But this interest also makes China’s dominance in infrastructure more visible. Major US-based mining companies MARA, Core Scientific, CleanSpark and Riot Platforms have highlighted the potential risks of over-reliance on Chinese hardware. Experts state that imports of Chinese-made devices will continue in the short term, but the US wants to transform the mining ecosystem by pushing for localization of these productions. “This is not an industry coup; it is the beginning of a long-overdue change,” says economist Ryan M. Yonk. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Trump's Tariff Resist Has Brought Results! Chinese Mining Equipment Manufacturers Have Started Moving Their Production Facilities to the US!

2025-06-18T14:41:55,"Spark crypto price crashes despite key metric hitting a record high","Spark token continued its freefall on Wednesday, June 18, a day after launching its highly anticipated airdrop. Spark ( SPK ) plunged to a low of $0.0470, down 30% from its highest point a day earlier. The decline came as its 24-hour trading volume surged 80% to over $378 million, significantly higher than its market capitalization of $83 million. Its fully diluted valuation also rose. The token crashed even as Spark’s ecosystem continued to show strength. According to DeFi Llama, the total value locked in its network jumped to a record high of over $6.66 billion, up from $6.48 billion in April. Spark provides on-chain capital allocation services, borrowing from Sky Protocol ( SKY ) and allocating that capital across decentralized finance, centralized finance, and real-world assets. It also allows users to deposit stablecoins to earn returns. According to its website , Spark’s savings TVL stands at $3.29 billion, with an average savings rate of 4.50%. The platform also enables users to borrow USDS and USDS+ against their liquid assets. You might also like: Spark price plunges 60% as sparkle fizzles out Why Spark crypto price crashed Spark token declined despite being listed on major crypto exchanges including Binance, Coinbase, Bybit, OKX, and Bitget. Some of these platforms are even offering incentives to attract investors. For example, OKX is offering a $100,000 reward to users who deposit USDC into the Spark USDC Savings Vault. The token’s drop is likely tied to the ongoing crypto market downturn, which has impacted Bitcoin ( BTC ) and most altcoins. Popular tokens like Virtuals Protocol, Dogwifhat, and Kaspa each plunged by over 10%. Another likely factor is the anticipated token unlocks. Spark launched with a circulating supply of 1.7 billion tokens, compared to a maximum supply of 10 billion, meaning 8.3 billion tokens are set to be released over the coming years, significantly increasing supply. It’s typical for newly listed tokens to decline initially, as airdrop recipients begin selling. For example, ZKsync ( ZK ) dropped over 30% in its early days before surging to a record high. Similarly, Berachain ( BERA ) fell by 43% before rebounding to a high of $9.18. This suggests Spark’s token may also recover in the coming weeks.

2025-06-18T14:40:36,"Nobitex Suffers Devastating $81.7 Million Crypto Hack","BitcoinWorld Nobitex Suffers Devastating $81.7 Million Crypto Hack The world of cryptocurrency often feels like the Wild West, full of innovation and opportunity, but also lurking dangers. Recently, the spotlight turned to Iran, where its largest crypto exchange, Nobitex , reportedly fell victim to a significant cyberattack. This incident has sent ripples through the local and international crypto community, highlighting the persistent security challenges faced by exchanges globally. Let’s dive into what happened during this crypto hack and what it means for users and the industry. What Happened During the Nobitex Crypto Hack? According to reports from blockchain security firm SlowMist, the Nobitex platform experienced a security breach. The attack specifically targeted the exchange’s hot wallets – the online wallets used for processing faster transactions – and also managed to compromise parts of its internal infrastructure. This combination suggests a sophisticated attack vector, potentially allowing attackers access to sensitive systems beyond just the immediate crypto funds. Initial estimations of the losses were significant. On-chain analyst ZachXBT, known for tracking illicit crypto flows, put the estimated losses at a staggering $81.7 million hack . This figure represents a substantial amount, especially within the context of Iran’s economic landscape and its growing crypto adoption. The attack didn’t just affect one blockchain network. The estimated losses reportedly spanned multiple prominent networks: TRON (TRX) Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible networks (including Ethereum and potentially others) Bitcoin (BTC) network The involvement of multiple networks indicates the attackers were able to access various hot wallets holding different types of cryptocurrencies. Who Claimed Responsibility for the Breach? Adding another layer to this incident, a hacker group known as Gonjeshke Darande has reportedly claimed responsibility for the cyberattack on Nobitex . While the full details of the group’s motives or capabilities are still emerging, such claims often accompany high-profile breaches and can be politically or financially motivated. Why is a Hack on Iran’s Largest Crypto Exchange Significant? Nobitex holds a prominent position as the largest Iran crypto exchange . This means the breach doesn’t just affect the exchange itself but also a large number of Iranian users who rely on the platform for trading and storing their digital assets. The incident raises critical questions about the security standards of major exchanges, regardless of their geographical location. Centralized exchanges like Nobitex are often prime targets for hackers due to the large volume of assets they hold in hot wallets to facilitate quick trades. While hot wallets are convenient, they are inherently more vulnerable than cold storage (offline wallets) because they are connected to the internet. What Can We Learn from This $81.7 Million Hack? Every security incident, unfortunately, provides valuable lessons. The $81.7 million hack on Nobitex underscores several key points for both exchanges and individual crypto users: For Exchanges: Enhanced Hot Wallet Security: Exchanges must implement multi-layered security protocols for hot wallets, including multi-signature requirements, strict access controls, and continuous monitoring. Robust Internal Infrastructure Security: Compromise of internal systems can be as damaging as wallet breaches. Regular security audits, penetration testing, and employee training against phishing and social engineering are crucial. Faster Incident Response: Having a clear plan for detecting, responding to, and mitigating breaches can limit losses and build user trust. Transparent Communication: While sensitive, timely and transparent communication with users about the incident is vital for managing panic and providing guidance. For Users: Diversify Storage: Do not keep all your funds on an exchange, especially large amounts. Utilize cold storage solutions like hardware wallets for long-term holding. Enable All Security Features: Use two-factor authentication (2FA), withdrawal whitelisting, and strong, unique passwords on all exchange accounts. Be Wary of Phishing: Attackers often target users directly to gain access to accounts. Be cautious of suspicious emails or messages. Stay Informed: Pay attention to security announcements from the exchanges you use. Is Your Crypto Safe on an Iran Crypto Exchange? This incident naturally leads users, particularly those in Iran, to question the safety of their funds on domestic platforms. While Nobitex is a major player, this hack highlights that no exchange is entirely immune to sophisticated attacks. The key is not necessarily the location but the security measures implemented by the exchange and the personal security practices of the user. The involvement of networks like TRON, EVM, and Bitcoin in the losses shows the broad impact of the breach across different asset types held on the exchange. The investigation into how Gonjeshke Darande allegedly carried out the attack will be critical in understanding the specific vulnerabilities exploited. Looking Ahead: The Future of Security After the $81.7 Million Hack The crypto industry is constantly evolving, and unfortunately, so are the methods of cybercriminals. The $81.7 million hack on Nobitex serves as a stark reminder that security must be the top priority for all participants. For exchanges, this means continuous investment in cybersecurity infrastructure, talent, and protocols. For users, it means taking personal responsibility for securing their digital assets and being aware of the risks involved in using online platforms. While a hack of this magnitude is undoubtedly a setback for Nobitex and its users, it also provides a critical opportunity for the exchange and the broader Iranian crypto market to learn and strengthen their defenses against future threats. The focus will now be on Nobitex’s response, recovery efforts, and how they plan to prevent similar incidents from occurring. The incident also puts a spotlight on the activities of groups like Gonjeshke Darande and the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks targeting the crypto space globally. Conclusion: Vigilance is Key The reported $81.7 million hack on Nobitex , Iran’s largest Iran crypto exchange , is a significant event that underscores the persistent security challenges in the cryptocurrency world. Affecting multiple networks including TRON, EVM, and Bitcoin, and allegedly claimed by Gonjeshke Darande , the breach highlights the vulnerabilities associated with hot wallets and internal systems. This incident serves as a crucial case study, reinforcing the need for exchanges to prioritize robust security measures and for users to adopt best practices for protecting their digital assets. While the path to full recovery and enhanced security may be challenging, the lessons learned from this substantial crypto hack are invaluable for the future resilience of the crypto ecosystem.

2025-06-18T14:38:32,"Why are Bitcoin and crypto prices down today?","Geopolitical risks and macroeconomic uncertainty are creating a risk-averse environment, and Bitcoin and crypto could slide further. Crypto markets have been under pressure over the past week, mainly due to global instability. On Wednesday, June 18, the overall crypto market dropped 1.06% to $3.25 trillion, with Bitcoin (BTC) falling to a daily low of $103,396, down 5% over the last seven days. Altcoins led the decline, with Ethereum ( ETH) reaching a daily low of $2,456 and posting a 10% drop over the same period. Escalating geopolitical tensions, along with concerns over macroeconomic policy, are weighing heavily on risk assets. You might also like: Corporations continue to spawn Bitcoin treasuries— What’s good about them? Over the past few days, crypto prices have largely reacted to Israel’s war with Iran, with signs of escalation fueling further declines. As of June 18, there were still no indications that the conflict could be resolved quickly. Also, signs of further escalation emerged as President Donald Trump refused to rule out direct military involvement. Meanwhile, investors are closely watching the Federal Reserve’s upcoming decision on interest rates, also set for June 18. According to Arthur Aziziov, Founder and Investor at B2 Ventures, this decision could offer some much-needed positive news for Bitcoin. You might also like: Bitcoin price primed for recovery, unless geopolitical tensions get worse: Bitfinex If Bitcoin drops, crypto markets will be hit hard Aziziov notes that there have been very few positive developments globally. This has weighed on sentiment and risks pushing Bitcoin even lower, likely triggering a broader decline across stablecoins. “If no positive sentiment emerges in the near future, Bitcoin could very well retreat into the $90,000-$84,000 range. On the other hand, if a positive backdrop does appear — particularly if the Fed signals a rate cut — then Bitcoin is likely to reach $128,000 by the end of the year,” Arthur Aziziov, B2 Ventures. Key levels to watch, according to Aziziov, are $112,000 and $100,500, currently the most important resistance and support levels. Any move beyond these will likely trigger either a major rally or a collapse. Indeed, as noted in this crypto.news analysis , there is a likelihood that Bitcoin could fall below $100,000.

2025-06-18T14:30:34,"Spain’s BBVA Advises Wealthy Clients to Invest 3–7% in Crypto","Spain’s second-largest bank, BBVA (Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria), is encouraging its high-net-worth clients to consider allocating a portion of their investment portfolio to cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC). According to a Reuters report published Tuesday, the bank now advises clients to invest between 3% and 7% of their portfolio in crypto, depending on their risk appetite. Philippe Meyer, head of digital and blockchain solutions at BBVA Switzerland, said at a conference in London that the bank began recommending Bitcoin to private banking clients as early as September 2023. “If you look at a balanced portfolio, if you introduce 3%, you already boost the performance,” Meyer explained. “At 3%, you are not taking a huge risk.” He also noted that clients have responded positively, challenging the narrative that crypto is too risky for traditional investors. BBVA’s advice contrasts with the broader stance of European regulators, who remain cautious about crypto. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) recently noted that 95% of banks in the EU continue to avoid any crypto involvement, citing regulatory and volatility concerns. BBVA Secures Regulatory Approval to Offer Crypto Trading in Spain BBVA has been offering crypto trading services since 2021 and moved toward active advisory in late 2024, setting it apart from other traditional banking institutions. In March this year, Spain’s securities regulator authorized BBVA to offer trading services for both Bitcoin and Ether to clients in the country. Initially launched for select private banking customers, BBVA’s crypto services will soon be integrated into its mobile application, allowing users to buy, sell, and manage digital assets seamlessly. The expansion marks a notable shift in the bank’s strategy as it embraces digital finance more aggressively. Traditional Banks Slowly Warming to Crypto BBVA’s growing involvement in crypto aligns with the broader regulatory changes brought on by the European Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) . Now fully implemented, MiCA provides a unified legal framework for digital assets in the EU. Crypto companies have until July 2026 to comply fully with its standards under an 18-month transition period. While most banks remain hesitant, some are beginning to follow BBVA’s lead. Santander, another major Spanish bank, is exploring the launch of its own stablecoin and expanding crypto services to retail clients. According to a May report, the bank is considering issuing both dollar- and euro-backed tokens as it navigates the emerging digital finance space.

2025-06-18T14:30:33,"US Dollar Critical Slips Ahead of Fed Decisions","BitcoinWorld US Dollar Critical Slips Ahead of Fed Decisions For those navigating the volatile world of digital assets, keeping an eye on traditional financial markets is crucial. The recent dip in the US Dollar on the Forex Market is one such signal, occurring just before potentially significant announcements from the Federal Reserve . This movement, coupled with fresh data showing cooling UK Inflation , paints a complex picture for global markets and has implications that even crypto enthusiasts should consider. Why is the US Dollar Under Pressure Right Now? The US Dollar , often seen as a safe-haven currency, has shown signs of weakening recently. This softness isn’t happening in a vacuum. It’s largely driven by market anticipation surrounding upcoming decisions from the Federal Reserve . Traders are positioning themselves based on expectations about the future path of Interest Rates . When expectations lean towards rates holding steady or even potentially decreasing in the future, the appeal of holding dollar-denominated assets offering high returns diminishes, putting downward pressure on the currency. Other factors contributing to the dollar’s current stance include: Shifting global economic sentiment. Comparative strength or weakness of other major currencies in the Forex Market . Technical trading patterns and market liquidity conditions. This dynamic is a classic example of how forward-looking markets react to expected central bank actions, influencing the value of major currencies. What’s on the Horizon for the Federal Reserve and Interest Rates ? The spotlight is firmly on the Federal Reserve as it prepares for its next policy meeting. The primary tool the Fed uses to influence the economy is adjusting the benchmark Interest Rates . For over a year, the focus has been on raising rates to combat inflation. However, with inflation showing signs of easing (though still above the Fed’s target), the debate has shifted. Market participants are closely watching for two key things from the Fed: The Rate Decision: Will they hold rates steady again, or is there any chance of a surprise move? The overwhelming expectation is for rates to remain unchanged at this meeting. Forward Guidance: This is arguably more important. What language does the Fed use regarding future rate hikes? Do they signal that the hiking cycle is definitively over, or do they keep the door open for further increases if inflation proves stubborn? Any hint about the future direction of Interest Rates can significantly impact the US Dollar , bond yields, and broader market sentiment, including potentially risk assets like cryptocurrencies. How Does Cooling UK Inflation Fit into the Global Picture? Across the Atlantic, the United Kingdom recently released inflation data that showed a notable cooling. This is a significant development because central banks globally have been battling high inflation, much like the Federal Reserve . Lower inflation numbers provide central banks, such as the Bank of England, more flexibility regarding their own Interest Rates policy. Key takeaways from the UK Inflation data: Headline inflation decreased more than expected. This reduces the pressure on the Bank of England to continue aggressively hiking rates. It contributes to a global narrative that inflationary pressures might be easing across developed economies. While seemingly separate, developments in major economies like the UK can influence global capital flows and sentiment, indirectly impacting the Forex Market and potentially contributing to the broader environment where the US Dollar is currently trading. The Interplay: Forex Market , Macro Data, and Asset Classes The connection between the US Dollar ‘s performance, the Federal Reserve ‘s stance on Interest Rates , and international economic data like UK Inflation is fundamental to understanding the Forex Market . Currency values reflect the economic health and monetary policy expectations of a country relative to others. Here’s a simplified view of the connections: Factor Impact on US Dollar (Likely) Broader Market Impact (Potential) Fed holds rates, signals end of hikes Negative (Lower future returns) Positive for risk assets (lower borrowing costs) Fed holds rates, remains hawkish Mixed (Rates high now, but future uncertain) Mixed to Negative (Uncertainty persists) Cooling UK Inflation Indirectly positive (suggests global trend, less pressure on other central banks to hike aggressively vs Fed) Positive for global sentiment (inflation easing) Understanding these relationships provides context for why the US Dollar ‘s movements are watched so closely by participants in all financial markets, not just currency traders. Actionable Insights for the Crypto-Curious How do these seemingly distant macroeconomic events relate to the world of Bitcoin and altcoins? Cryptocurrencies, while a distinct asset class, do not exist in a vacuum. They are influenced by global liquidity, risk sentiment, and the strength of traditional financial systems. Here’s what to consider: Dollar Strength vs. Risk Assets: Historically, a weaker US Dollar has sometimes correlated with stronger performance in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. When the dollar is strong, global capital tends to flow into dollar-denominated assets; when it weakens, that capital might seek opportunities elsewhere. Interest Rates and Liquidity: The Federal Reserve ‘s decisions on Interest Rates directly impact the cost of borrowing and the overall liquidity in the financial system. Lower rates generally mean more liquidity, which can flow into speculative assets like crypto. Higher rates tighten liquidity, potentially making riskier investments less attractive. Inflation Narrative: While UK Inflation is specific to Britain, the broader trend of inflation potentially cooling globally could influence central bank behavior everywhere. If inflation is truly under control, central banks might become less aggressive, which could be seen as a positive backdrop for asset markets. While there’s no one-to-one correlation, being aware of these macro forces helps in understanding potential market headwinds or tailwinds. It’s about recognizing that the health and direction of the traditional financial system, heavily influenced by the Federal Reserve and global economic data like UK Inflation , inevitably cast a shadow on newer markets like crypto. Navigating the Uncertainty Ahead The current environment is marked by anticipation. The US Dollar is reacting to expected policy, the Federal Reserve is at a critical juncture regarding Interest Rates , and international data like UK Inflation adds layers to the global economic puzzle. For anyone involved in financial markets, including the Forex Market and cryptocurrencies, staying informed about these developments is not just recommended, it’s essential. The outcome of the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, in particular, will provide significant clarity on the likely path of Interest Rates and could set the tone for the US Dollar and global markets for the coming months. Paying attention to the details – the rate decision itself and, crucially, the language used in the official statements and press conferences – will be key. Understanding these macro signals doesn’t provide guaranteed trading signals for crypto, but it offers valuable context for the broader market environment in which digital assets operate. It helps investors appreciate the larger forces at play that can influence everything from institutional sentiment to overall market liquidity. Summary: Key Takeaways To wrap up, here are the core points from the current market situation: The US Dollar has weakened, largely in anticipation of the Federal Reserve ‘s upcoming decisions. The Fed’s stance on Interest Rates is the central focus, with markets expecting a hold but scrutinizing guidance on future policy. Cooling UK Inflation adds to the narrative of easing global inflationary pressures, potentially giving central banks more room. These factors are driving movements in the Forex Market and have indirect but significant implications for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, by influencing liquidity and sentiment. Staying informed on these macro developments is crucial for understanding the broader financial landscape impacting all asset classes. The coming days, particularly around the Federal Reserve announcement, are poised to provide more clarity, but the interplay between major currencies, central bank policy, and global economic data will continue to be a dominant theme in the markets.

2025-06-18T14:30:30,"BBVA’s Crypto Call: Wealthy Investors Encouraged To Allocate Up To 7% To Bitcoin","Spanish bank BBVA now recommends that its affluent clients allocate 3-7% of their investment portfolios to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC). This announcement was made by Philippe Meyer, head of digital and blockchain solutions at BBVA Switzerland. BBVA’s Approach To Bitcoin And Crypto Investments Meyer shared this insight during the DigiAssets conference in London, indicating that the bank began advising clients on Bitcoin investments as early as September 2022. He noted that for clients with a higher risk appetite, BBVA is willing to endorse a digital asset allocation of up to 7%. This marks a significant evolution in the bank’s approach, as it has been facilitating client requests for cryptocurrency purchases since 2021 but is now formally advising on portfolio allocations. The timing of BBVA’s endorsement comes as cryptocurrency prices have seen substantial growth, particularly with Bitcoin reaching new record highs near the $112,000 mark in May. This recovery follows a turbulent period in 2022, when the collapse of prominent exchanges like the defunct FTX left many investors facing significant losses. The resurgence of digital currencies has also been bolstered by supportive stances from influential figures, including US President Donald Trump with a pro-crypto agenda taking shape in key roles and bills advancing in the Senate. Despite this increased interest for cryptocurrencies, many private banks typically execute client requests to buy cryptocurrencies, which is relatively rare for them to actively recommend such investments. The European Securities and Markets Authority has previously cautioned that a vast majority of EU banks—approximately 95%—do not engage in crypto activities, highlighting the cautious stance of the financial industry . Plans For More Meyer emphasized that BBVA is likely among the first major global banks to formally advise its wealthy clientele on digital asset investments. In June 2021, the bank launched Bitcoin trading and custody services through its Swiss subsidiary, aiming to establish itself as a leader in adopting blockchain technology. BBVA’s CEO for Switzerland, Alfonso Gómez, remarked at the time that this innovative offering positioned the bank as a benchmark institution in the evolving digital landscape. Currently, the bank’s investment advice focuses on Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH), with plans to expand recommendations to include additional cryptocurrencies later this year. Meyer expressed confidence in the strategy, suggesting that even a modest 3% allocation could enhance overall portfolio performance without exposing clients to significant risk. BBVA’s interest in digital currencies is not a recent development; the bank has been exploring Bitcoin and blockchain technology since at least 2015. In a forward-looking statement , BBVA acknowledged that institutions embracing digital currencies would likely lead the way in a new monetary system, underscoring their belief in the strategic advantages afforded to early adopters. https://www.tradingview.com/x/g5AHPExr/ When writing, the market’s leading crypto trades at $103,945, recording a drop of 4% in the weekly time frame.

2025-06-18T14:30:12,"Crypto Gets A Green Light From Spanish Banking Giant","Since late 2024, BBVA’s private‑banking arm in Switzerland has been quietly advising clients to add Bitcoin and Ether to their holdings. According to Philippe Meyer, who leads digital and blockchain solutions at BBVA Switzerland, wealthy customers should allocate between 3% and 7% of their portfolios to crypto. Based on reports, this advice aims to boost returns without exposing investors to outsized risk. Related Reading: Tether Enforces Freeze On $12 Million In Tron Funds Over Illicit Activity Early Adoption Timeline BBVA began executing crypto trades in 2021 for a handful of clients. By September 2024, Meyer says the bank had started formally recommending a 3% Bitcoin stake in balanced portfolios. Now, risk‑tolerant clients can move up to 7% into digital assets, reflecting BBVA’s growing confidence in crypto as a mainstream option. Philippe Meyer recently delivered a presentation at a blockchain conference in Lugano, Switzerland. Source: BBVA Switzerland. Client Reaction And Risk Views Many clients have responded well so far. Meyer notes that even a small 3% allocation “already boosts the performance” of a diversified portfolio and “you are not taking a huge risk” at that level. Short‑term swings still occur—crypto markets can drop 20% in a week—but private clients seem ready to ride those waves in pursuit of higher gains.

The guidance currently applies to Bitcoin and Ether, with plans… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 17, 2025 Regulatory And Market Context Europe’s Markets in Crypto‑Assets regulation (MiCA) took full effect at the end of December 2024. This rulebook governs token issuers and service providers across the EU. Yet the European Securities and Markets Authority reports that 95% of EU banks avoid crypto activities entirely. BBVA stands out: in March 2025, Spain’s securities regulator gave it formal approval to offer Bitcoin and Ether trading in the country. Related Reading: Record‑High Ethereum Open Interest Signals Institutional Confidence Next Steps For App And Investors BBVA plans to roll out buy, sell, and portfolio management features inside its existing mobile app over the coming months. The launch will begin with select clients before expanding more broadly. As rival banks like Santander explore their own stablecoins—pegged to dollars and euros—BBVA’s move could spur a wave of mainstream crypto services. For now, only high‑net‑worth clients hear this crypto advice. But if allocations deliver solid returns and BBVA weathers any market crashes, other banks may follow. That would give more investors the chance to include crypto alongside stocks, bonds, and real estate. The real test will come if Bitcoin or Ether plunge sharply. If BBVA’s cautious plan holds up under stress, it may reshape how mainstream finance treats digital assets.

The $3 trillion bank’s CEO Ian Stuart spoke to United Kingdom lawmakers last month about the threat, according to a new report in The Guardian. “The amount of money [that] banks, all of us, will be spending on our systems is enormous today. And it has to be. We are being attacked all the time.” Stuart reportedly said cybersecurity is now HSBC’s biggest expense, with the bank spending hundreds of millions of pounds to prevent hacks. EY reports that banks are expecting to use 11% of their IT budgets on cybersecurity this year, according to the Guardian. It’s not just a UK problem: A 2024 study from consumer insights and analytics firm J.D. Power indicated 29% of US bank customers and 22% of credit card users – at banks like Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs – experienced fraudulent activity on their accounts in the past 12 months. As fraud cases increase, J.D. Power reported that protection from illegal activity was a “key component to overall customer satisfaction, brand loyalty and advocacy” for banks. The study says that only 46% of bank customers and 40% of credit card users say they’ve been asked to act on fraud prevention measures in the last 90 days.

2025-06-18T14:29:54,"Bitcoin Clinches Fifth Consecutive Net Institutional Inflow, Solana Fund Dips","Digital assets saw another week of massive inflows to institutional products on surging sentiments. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether led gains, taking seven-day investments to $785 million. Meanwhile, mid-week Solana (SOL) and multi-asset funds succumbed to bearish tensions. Overall, traders’ bullish outlook follows an uptick in stocks and crypto prices. Bitcoin Institutional Funds Records $557 Million Gains A new CoinShares Digital Asset Weekly Flows data highlights growing institutional demand in May. In the last seven days, crypto institutional funds attracted $785 million, marking the fifth consecutive week of inflows after a prolonged downturn sparked by United States trade tensions. New wins have taken total assets under management (AUM) to $172 billion, while yearly inflow exceeded $7.5 billion. This surge reclaims the $6 billion losses between February and March. Bitcoin led the pack with $557 million gains, although a slight drop from previous weeks. This is due to hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve. Institutional demand for Bitcoin is also heading to a bull point as the price moves near its all-time high. Whale purchases have intensified since the last dip, strengthening investors’ year-end outlook. Adding to the growing demand, Metaplanet and Strategy continue accumulation, with the latter purchasing an additional 7,290 BTC. As expected, short-Bitcoin products faced outflow totaling $5.8 million last week after relatively high bull volumes. The United States led geographical data, with Hong Kong tapping a new high since November. “ Investor sentiment remained divided across regions. The US, Germany, and Hong Kong recorded inflows of US$681m, US$86.3m, and US$24.2m, respectively, with Hong Kong marking its largest inflow since November 2024. In contrast, Sweden, Canada, and Brazil saw outflows of US$16.3m, US$13.5m, and US$3.9m, respectively.” Ethereum Bullish, Solana Loses Steam Altcoin traders were shrouded in mixed signals due to fears of a heated market. Ethereum products notched $204 million, taking monthly inflows to $242 million while year-to-date figures surged past $757 million. XRP, SUI, and ADA saw $4.9 million, $9.3 million, and $500k inflows, respectively. On the other hand, institutional favorite Solana fell to bearish pressure as whales dumped assets. Experts believe this follows the profit-taking effect, although current headwinds have decreased the SOL price by 4%. According to the data, Solana recorded $900,000 in exits despite the expected spot ETFs in the United States.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-clinches-fifth-consecutive-net-institutional-inflow-solana-fund-dips/,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|SOL|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

The total loss exceeded $15M after a series of partial liquidations. One of the notable traders on Hyperliquid, known as Aguila Trades, has closed a 20X leverage short position on BTC. During the brief correction in the past days, the trader did not take profits. Now, they face a series of partial liquidations. The trading move by Aguila Trades was closely watched as whale positions on Hyperliquid could sway the direction of the BTC market. The ""Mysterious Whale"" @AguilaTrades has closed his $BTC (20x) long position, resulting in a total loss of $15.42M in 2 trades. https://t.co/KvY5js9vTV pic.twitter.com/YfQvf7I1uD — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) June 18, 2025 On-chain whales are under public microscope On-chain data shows the position was finally closed, but the attempt to short BTC led to losses of $15.24M . Hyperliquid leveraged trading remains highly risky, and some of the positions are seen as deliberate stunts. However, unlike James Wynn , Aguila Trades has not commented on the positions or plans for the future. The trader also has not tweeted since January, simply testing out the possibilities on Hyperliquid. The trader then switched to a small 20X leverage long position , with just 0.55 BTC and an unrealized loss of under $1,000. In the meantime, one of Wynn’s known addresses is only holding a minimal long BTC position, though there were claims of trading through new secret addresses. Currently, BTC trades around $104,081, showing uncertainty over the developments between Israel and Iran, while awaiting the Fed interest rate decision. BTC general open interest fell from $35B down to $32.7B as traders become more cautious. Leveraged positions are pressuring BTC in a tight range between $106,000 and $103,000, potentially leading to both short and long liquidations if the price is pushed to those levels. Hyperliquid trading slowed down in May Hyperliquid volumes seem to be slowing down, despite the efforts of high-profile whales. For the entire month of May, the DEX saw over $134B in total volumes, down from $248B during the peak activity in April. Hyperliquid activity remains high, but activity for the past month was notably lower, despite the presence of high-profile whales. | Source: Dune Analytics The DEX also still lags behind Binance’s spot volumes as a benchmark . Hyperliquid still produced near-record fees above $2.48M on a daily basis, staying strong in the top 10 apps based on economic activity. Total open interest is at over $7.91B, lower than the all-time peak, but showing signs of recovery. Over 50% of open positions are for BTC, with $1.5B for ETH and around $522M for SOL. Smaller meme tokens and the native HYPE token see around $1B in open interest, as the positions are more volatile. So far, few whales have held public positions on memes, instead preferring to post high-profile trades on BTC. The slower activity on the DEX also reflected on the native HYPE token. After a recent peak above $45, HYPE retreated to $38.21, reflecting the overall market uncertainty. Despite this, three whale addresses were noticed accumulating HYPE . One of the whales bought in the $38 range, the second one accumulated above $39 , and the last one continued to buy above $40. The token continues to share the profits of Hyperliquid while also awaiting a higher price range. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

On that day, total crypto market capitalization peaked at $3.4 trillion. As of June 18, it stands at $3.24 trillion, according to data from CoinMarketCap , marking a sharp retreat that reflects growing investor anxiety around geopolitical uncertainty. crypto market cap since June 12. Source: CoinMarketCap Volume has also pulled back, falling to $117.71 billion, down from $125.18 billion recorded at the peak of the rally last Wednesday. While crypto is often described as a hedge against macro risk, recent history shows that when true global tensions escalate, even Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) are not immune from the initial flight to safety. Broader crypto market dynamics The Israel–Iran conflict has had far-reaching effects across risk-on assets. Equities saw increased volatility last week, and oil briefly spiked before retreating on speculation that the conflict would remain regional. In crypto, however, the mood has decisively shifted from “buy the dip” to “wait and see.” Major altcoins including XRP, SOL, and ADA have posted high single-digit weekly losses, and even Bitcoin, still above $105,000, has struggled to regain upside momentum despite improving ETF flows.

AguilaTrades losing Bitcoin position. Source: HyperDash AguillaTrades, who boasts $77.36 million in profits on Bybit over the past year, has experienced a dramatic reversal of fortune after transitioning to the Hyperliquid platform, according to the latest on-chain data retrieved by Finbold from Lookonchain on June 18. Details of the trading activity show a pattern of missed opportunities and poor risk management. Indeed, the trader was up $5.8 million on a previous Bitcoin ( BTC ) long position using 20x leverage but failed to take profits, ultimately losing $12.47 million when the market turned against him. A similar scenario played out again when he was up $10 million but refused to cash out, resulting in another $2.5 million loss. Bitcoin price analysis Bitcoin slipped below the key $104,000 level on June 17, shedding nearly 4% in 24 hours. The drop mirrors a broader $160 billion wipeout in the crypto market, as escalating Middle East tensions, particularly the U.S.-Iran standoff, rattle investor sentiment. Bitcoin’s failed attempt to reclaim the $105,000 resistance has invited a wave of profit-taking, stalling its recent momentum toward a potential new all-time high. Still, institutional interest remains resilient. Despite the downturn, over $1.46 billion has flowed into Bitcoin ETFs over the past five days. Meanwhile, markets await today’s Federal Reserve decision, where interest rates are expected to remain unchanged. However, traders will be closely watching Powell’s guidance for any signals on future rate cuts.

2025-06-18T14:06:48,"Bitcoin (BTC) Stays Resilient as Crypto Market Struggles","In the face of conflicts and economic uncertainty Bitcoin is managing to stay above the important support at $104,000. While $BTC is just hanging on with its price in the green, the vast majority of altcoins have sunk into the red. Will Bitcoin join them, or can it continue to hold the line? Chaos and uncertainty continue to reign The current chaotic and dreadfully uncertain world is continuing to be so. The Israel/Iran conflict is persisting, and the Russia/Ukraine war is proving to be extremely difficult to resolve. The recent G7 summit was not able to come to an accord with which to show a united front on the conflict in Ukraine due to resistance from the US, therefore uncertainty reigns, and markets will have a hard time pricing in what may come. $BTC quick drop into the red Source: TradingView At time of writing, the $BTC price has now fallen into the red and is in danger of dropping through the $104,400 support. This can certainly take place, although as long as the price does not fall below $100,440, which is the last big swing low, there is still hope for the bulls. What would perhaps be expected is that either the $104,400 horizontal support level will actually hold, or that another candle wick could take the price down to the area of $103,000. Ascending trendline lends support Source: TradingView Moving out into the daily time frame it can be noted that an ascending trendline could also lend its weight to halting the current slide in price. There is the possibility that a wick could shoot down through both ascending trendline and support, but $BTC is entering an oversold condition now and it may not be long before the downward price action reverses and is bought back up. At the bottom of the chart, the daily RSI does have the indicator line below the yellow moving average, and it is also dropping below the 50.00 level. This is fairly bearish, so a return above that 50.00 support level will need to occur. Bearish weekly outlook, but plenty of time left for a change Source: TradingView Concerns are also appearing on the weekly time frame. It can be seen that if the support does not hold, a dip that could even take the price below $100,000 could take place. Moving through the indicators at the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI has its indicator lines poised to potentially drop through the very important 80.00 level. The RSI indicator line has a downward trajectory, which could see it cross below the yellow moving average, while the MACD indicator at the bottom of the chart is showing a roll over of the indicator lines, at the same time that the light green histogram columns are getting smaller. All the above is pointing to a quite bearish scenario. However, we are not even half way through the week. All the shorter-term momentum indicators have bottomed for $BTC and an upward impulse would be expected to take place, and soon. How strong the next upward surge can be will likely have an impact on whether the price will keep rolling over, or whether all the indicators can tip back to the upside and propel Bitcoin back to the all-time high.

2025-06-18T14:06:28,"Senate Passes Stablecoin Bill in 68-30 Vote Despite Warren’s Warning of “Massive Financial Crisis”","The Genius Act, a set of new regulations for stablecoins , passed the Senate with a 68-30 vote in favour of the crypto legislation. The Genius Act received enough bipartisan support to pass the Senate and reach the next round of scrutiny. Eighteen Democrats joined the Republicans to vote for the bill. Stablecoins are digital assets pegged to real-world assets such as the US dollar. The crypto industry has witnessed a strange turn of events, from experiencing a draconian ‘war on crypto’ under the previous administration to a sudden supportive President Trump creating very generous incentives for the crypto industry. However, the change of context comes after the crypto industry pumped over $131 million into the Trump campaign. Some Republicans voted against the bill, such as Rand Paul, who is sceptical about the Genius Act and its generous concessions to the technology sector, particularly big tech companies like Microsoft and Amazon. However, big tech firms such as Amazon and Meta will be barred from enjoying the use of stablecoins if they do not provide consumer protections regarding data security and financial safety rails. The Genius Act provides other protections for consumers, such as an extra set of provisions that give stablecoin holders priority in an economic crisis, so that banks or companies are barred from using the reserve dollar to steal customers’ funds. Therefore, if a stablecoin issuer faces a crisis, stablecoin holders will receive priority when withdrawing their funds. The largest banks of America, including Bank of America, lobbied hard to bar non-established banks from issuing stablecoins. Such a move would have monopolized an innovation invented to protect Americans from corrupt banks. Circle, a stablecoin issuer and Nasdaq-listed company, may benefit from the Genesis Act because it has invested heavily in its own USDC token. Shareholders have boosted Circle’s price, possibly to take advantage of the new regulatory environment. A company spokesperson commended the senators for passing the act and stated that the new legislation could preserve the US dollar in a new technological age. The company further commended both Republicans and Democrats for supporting legislation that promotes innovation while protecting consumers at the same time. The new bill now has to pass the House of Representatives, and if it passes, it will be placed on President Trump’s desk to be signed into law. Elizabeth Warren , a senator who opposed the bill, accused it of placing more power into the hands of a few tech billionaires, who will use the Genius Act to abuse their customers by accessing their financial data. Warren calls the legislation a “weak bill” and is concerned that wealthy companies will use the new laws to control money more insidiously. Warren has advocated against banks having too much power to prevent a financial crisis from occurring in the future. Warren argues that the Genesis Act allows banks and corporations to have greater freedoms with the use of stablecoins, which traditional financial institutions are usually restricted from enjoying. The greater freedoms seem to bypass the regulations that resulted from the 2008 financial crisis. Ironically, Bitcoin was invented to circumvent the corrupt banks that were given a bailout during the financial crash. Warren predicts that America will experience a massive financial crisis in the next two years due to the deregulation of traditional markets. The House of Representatives is still waiting on the outcome of the Clarity Act, which aims to provide more certainty about the rules of digital assets. Democrats who oppose the Genius Act also oppose the Clarity Act for similar reasons, namely that the two bills conspire against working-class Americans and will ultimately benefit a select few billionaires and their companies.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/senate-passes-stablecoin-bill-in-68-30-vote-despite-warrens-warning-of-massive-financial-crisis/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|Stablecoins",cryptocompare

The Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered near 42,246, up 30 points at the open, while the benchmark U.S. index S&P 500 held near record highs with a gain of 0.01%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite was flat, up just 0.01%. All three major indices were slightly in the green but remained constrained as the Middle East conflict weighed heavily on investor confidence. Israel-Iran war weighs on markets While stocks looked to hold onto recent gains, markets lacked upside conviction. On Wednesday, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed that the country would not surrender to Israel . The Iranian leader’s comments came after President Donald Trump posted that Iran had to surrender unconditionally, with speculation rife that the United States is set to join the conflict. Khamenei warned that U.S. involvement would be “to its own detriment.” The US entering in this matter [war] is 100% to its own detriment. The damage it will suffer will be far greater than any harm that Iran may encounter. — Khamenei.ir (@khamenei_ir) June 18, 2025 U.S. Treasury yields hovered largely unchanged amid this backdrop, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note at 4.385% and the 2-year at 3.948%. Oil prices continued to climb following Israel’s surprise attack on Iran, which escalated into further hostilities, with Iran striking Tel Aviv and other locations inside Israel. Meanwhile, weakness across risk assets has seen cryptocurrencies swing lower, led by Bitcoin( BTC ), which gave up gains from above $108,000 to below $105,000. Read more: Oil, inflation, and Bitcoin are now locked in the same trade Investors await Fed’s rate decision As well as the Middle East conflict, investors will be keen on the Fed ‘s policy decision later on Wednesday. Chair Jerome Powell, under mounting pressure from Trump in recent months to cut rates, is scheduled to speak at 2 p.m. ET. Consensus is that the central bank will hold rates steady, but attention will be on the so-called “dot plot,” which offers insight into whether the Fed’s previously projected two rate cuts are still on the table.

Details from the Department of Labor showed weekly claims continue to hover near an 8-month high, with 245,000 initial jobless claims filed in the past week, slightly off the expected 250,000 in the week ending June 7.

2025-06-18T14:00:00,"BTC News: While Bitcoin Stagnates, Bitcoin Solaris Takes Aim at Polygon’s Market Position With Superior Technology","As Bitcoin drifts sideways and volatility dries up, the spotlight has shifted to the altcoins that are still building, scaling, and innovating. One name that’s rising fast both in price and attention is Bitcoin Solaris. BTC-S is more than a new chain. It’s an ecosystem built with the performance and scalability that legacy chains like Polygon aimed for but never fully reached. And with a presale explosion already underway, Bitcoin Solaris is now positioning itself to challenge and possibly surpass Polygon’s place in the market. Polygon Was First to Scale Ethereum. But the Game Has Moved On. Polygon brought real solutions to Ethereum’s bottlenecks. With its sidechains and Layer-2 architecture, it opened the floodgates for scalable dApps, especially in DeFi and NFTs. But its success also revealed its limits: centralization concerns, high validator requirements, and reliance on Ethereum’s network stability. Bitcoin Solaris, by contrast, enters with a fresh foundation. It doesn’t just scale another chain. It builds its own parallel architecture from the ground up. And more importantly, it invites the average user in, not just developers. Bitcoin Solaris: A Dual-Layer Engine Designed for Real Growth Bitcoin Solaris is built to go faster, farther, and deeper into mass adoption. Its core structure includes a dual-layer consensus model where the Base Layer runs Proof-of-Work (PoW) for unmatched security, while the Solaris Layer executes transactions at lightning speeds using Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS). The result is one of the most efficient and balanced blockchain systems in development. Here’s what powers it: 300-second PoW block time with SHA-256 compatibility 15-second DPoS blocks with 32MB dynamic sizing Validator rotation every 24 hours for decentralization State synchronization between layers for seamless integrity Built-in privacy through Zero-Knowledge Proofs With up to 100,000 transactions per second and 2-second finality, Bitcoin Solaris is a technical beast that doesn’t sacrifice security to achieve speed. Smart Contracts at Lightning Speed: See Why Everyone Loves BTC-S Accessible Mining With Real-World Profitability Where Polygon never offered native mining, Bitcoin Solaris thrives. Through the exciting release of the Solaris Nova app, mining becomes as easy as tapping your screen. Whether you’re using a phone, laptop, or full rig, BTC-S empowers anyone to contribute and earn. The system adapts to your device’s capabilities and uses energy-efficient algorithms that operate 99.95% leaner than traditional mining networks. To see what your device could earn, the team has launched a live calculator that breaks it all down by type and performance. Mining isn’t just a backend process anymore. It’s a feature every user can access and benefit from daily. Liquid Staking Without Sacrifice One standout innovation from Bitcoin Solaris is its approach to staking. Instead of locking assets, users who stake receive sBTC-S at a 1:1 ratio, enabling them to remain fully active within the ecosystem. This feature integrates directly with the Solaris Nova app and supports DeFi use cases, governance, and liquidity. Explore the full breakdown here . Key staking advantages include: Passive income without lockups DeFi-ready sBTC-S tokens Enhanced decentralization and validator strength Integrated into a mobile-first experience Presale Firestorm: $5 Million Raised and Climbing Bitcoin Solaris is currently in phase 8 of its presale, priced at $8 per token. With over 11,500 unique buyers onboard, the market momentum is undeniable. The next price jump is to $9, with a final launch price of $20, giving investors a potential 150% return from this point alone. Only around 6 weeks left in the presale Over $5 million raised One of the shortest and most explosive presales in the 2025 cycle For more details and live updates, check out the Bitcoin Solaris website . Influencers Are Paying Attention With so much buzz, it’s no surprise that Bitcoin Solaris is getting serious attention across YouTube and social channels. Reviews by Token Empire and Crypto Show have dissected the project’s architecture, mining tools, staking mechanics, and future plans, with many enthusiasts calling BTC-S the most promising launch of the year. Another feature catching the attention of everyone is Bitcoin Solaris’s daily mini games that reward users and allow a lot of people to increase their earnings before the official release. Final Verdict While Bitcoin continues to hold value, it’s no longer moving markets. Polygon’s structure still works, but has become stagnant. Bitcoin Solaris is the fresh blood the ecosystem needs: bringing user-first mining, lightning-fast finality, and accessible staking into a fully integrated, mobile-driven chain. Whether it’s through scalable tech, inclusive mining, or DeFi-ready staking, BTC-S is coming not just to participate, but to dominate. Polygon opened the door. Bitcoin Solaris plans to walk through it and never look back.

That number is a 16% jump from the previous quarter, up to around 3.3% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Fresh announcements show that now, even coffee chains are jumping into the Bitcoin buying frenzy led by Michael Saylor’s Strategy .

2025-06-18T13:50:01,"Nobitex Exploit: Massive $48.65M Attack Hits Iranian Crypto Exchange on TRON Network","BitcoinWorld Nobitex Exploit: Massive $48.65M Attack Hits Iranian Crypto Exchange on TRON Network The world of cryptocurrency, while offering exciting opportunities, is unfortunately no stranger to security breaches. The latest incident shaking the market involves Nobitex, a prominent Iranian cryptocurrency exchange. Reports have surfaced detailing a significant Nobitex exploit on the TRON (TRX) Network, resulting in substantial financial losses. This event serves as a stark reminder of the persistent security challenges within the digital asset space. Understanding the Scope of the Nobitex Exploit According to on-chain detective ZachXBT, who shared details on Telegram, the Nobitex exploit led to estimated total losses of approximately $48.65 million. This figure represents a significant amount of value compromised from the exchange’s holdings or user funds held on the platform. Details emerging about the attack point to the use of a vanity address by the attacker. ZachXBT specifically noted the use of an address beginning with ‘TKFuck’, a tactic sometimes employed by malicious actors, potentially to taunt or simply for recognition. While the exact method of the exploit is still under investigation or not fully public, the outcome is clear: a large-scale compromise affecting a major regional exchange. The TRON Network Attack Context The incident specifically occurred on the TRON network attack . TRON is a popular blockchain platform known for its focus on decentralized applications and content sharing. While the exploit targeted Nobitex’s operations or wallets connected to the TRON network, it’s important to distinguish between an attack on the blockchain protocol itself and an attack on an entity operating on the network, like an exchange. In many exchange hacks, the vulnerability lies not within the underlying blockchain technology (like TRON, Bitcoin, or Ethereum) but rather in the exchange’s own systems, such as: Weaknesses in hot or cold wallet management Vulnerabilities in smart contracts used by the exchange Compromised private keys Insufficient security protocols or internal errors Phishing attacks targeting employees Further analysis will likely clarify if the vulnerability was specific to how Nobitex interacted with the TRON network or a more general security lapse within the exchange’s infrastructure that happened to impact TRON-based assets. Broader Implications of a Crypto Exchange Hack A crypto exchange hack like the one experienced by Nobitex has ripple effects far beyond the immediate financial loss. These incidents severely impact user trust, which is a critical component for any financial platform, especially in the nascent crypto industry. When an exchange is compromised, users worry about the safety of their own funds and may withdraw assets, potentially causing liquidity issues for the exchange. Other implications include: Reputational Damage: An exchange’s reputation can be severely tarnished, making it difficult to attract new users or retain existing ones. Regulatory Scrutiny: Security breaches often attract attention from financial regulators, potentially leading to investigations, fines, or stricter compliance requirements. Market Volatility: Large hacks can sometimes cause temporary dips in the prices of affected cryptocurrencies or the broader market due to panic selling or negative sentiment. Increased Security Costs: Exchanges are forced to invest heavily in improving their security infrastructure after an attack, which can be costly. For Nobitex, being the largest exchange in Iran, this event carries particular weight for the local crypto community and its confidence in digital asset platforms. Enhancing Cryptocurrency Security Measures In the wake of incidents like the Nobitex exploit , the focus inevitably shifts to enhancing cryptocurrency security . Both exchanges and individual users play a crucial role in mitigating risks. For exchanges, robust security practices are non-negotiable: Cold Storage: Keeping a vast majority of user funds in offline cold storage wallets, inaccessible from the internet. Multi-Signature Wallets: Requiring multiple private keys to authorize transactions, preventing a single point of failure. Regular Security Audits: Conducting frequent third-party audits of smart contracts, infrastructure, and internal processes. Intrusion Detection Systems: Implementing sophisticated systems to monitor for suspicious activity. Employee Training: Educating staff on phishing risks and secure operational procedures. For users, personal security is paramount: Enable 2FA: Always use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), preferably hardware-based, on your exchange accounts. Strong Passwords: Use unique, complex passwords and consider a password manager. Be Wary of Phishing: Verify the legitimacy of emails and websites before entering login details. Withdraw to Personal Wallets: For long-term storage, withdraw significant amounts of crypto from exchanges to hardware or software wallets where you control the private keys. Research Exchanges: Use reputable exchanges with a strong security track record. The Challenge of Digital Asset Loss and Recovery The estimated $48.65 million figure represents a significant digital asset loss . Recovering stolen cryptocurrency is incredibly challenging. While blockchain transactions are transparent and traceable, identifying and apprehending the individuals behind the wallet addresses used in exploits requires significant effort, often involving international cooperation between law enforcement and blockchain analytics firms. Trackers like ZachXBT play a vital role in following the flow of stolen funds across various networks and exchanges, making it harder for attackers to cash out undetected. However, once funds are laundered through mixers, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), or moved across multiple chains, they can become exceedingly difficult to trace back to an identifiable entity. For users affected by the Nobitex exploit, the path to recovery is uncertain. Exchanges sometimes use insurance funds or their own reserves to compensate users for losses, but this is not always guaranteed and depends heavily on the exchange’s policies and financial health. Conclusion: A Persistent Threat The Nobitex exploit on the TRON Network is another unfortunate chapter in the ongoing struggle for security in the cryptocurrency space. The estimated $48.65 million digital asset loss highlights the lucrative target that exchanges represent for malicious actors. This crypto exchange hack underscores the critical need for exchanges to continuously strengthen their cryptocurrency security measures and for users to adopt vigilant personal security practices. While the transparency of the TRON network allows for tracking, the recovery of funds after a large-scale TRON network attack targeting an exchange remains a complex challenge. As the industry matures, improving security infrastructure and user education will be paramount to building a safer ecosystem for everyone.

2025-06-18T13:41:01,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Consolidation Continues but Bearish Signs Flash","After multiple failed attempts to break above the $108K resistance, Bitcoin is consolidating within a tightening range, showing signs of distribution. The market is caught between two liquidity zones: the buy-side above $108K and the sell-side beneath $100K, while the price slowly gravitates toward the lower boundary. Momentum has weakened as seen in the RSI drop below 50 on both daily and 4H timeframes, suggesting bearish pressure is gaining control. By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart Bitcoin remains stuck in a broader consolidation pattern, forming a descending triangle just below a major resistance level. The RSI is holding around 46, and the price is still above the key trendline depicted in orange. This structure reflects a classic re-accumulation or distribution phase. If the bulls fail to reclaim $108K with conviction, the ascending trendline becomes a likely magnet. Moreover, the orange 100-day MA and the blue 200-day MA are still pointing up but have narrowed near the $95K region, indicating a slowdown in trend strength. The daily range between $100K–$108K is critical. So far, buyers have absorbed dips into the $101K–$103K zone, but continued lower highs and failure to flip the $108K area into support suggest the market may be preparing for a deeper sweep of liquidity. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, the price action has formed a clear descending channel. The lower highs show consistent bearish pressure, while support at $103.5K is being tested repeatedly. This is often a bearish continuation pattern, and with RSI around 41, the momentum leans toward the downside. The failure to break through the fair value gap (FVG) around $106K, and even failing to test it, confirms that sellers are defending the premium levels efficiently. Currently, market participants can expect a quick sweep of the double sell-side liquidity levels marked around $102K and $103K. A break and close below these levels could open up a run toward the key daily demand at the $100K area. Meanwhile, any upside breakout above $110K must begin with a reclaim of the FVG zone convincingly to flip short-term sentiment. On-Chain Analysis Exchange Whale Ratio The whale ratio on exchanges has surged above 0.55, its highest point in over a year, which is typically considered a warning signal. This metric measures the proportion of the top 10 inflows to total inflows on exchanges. Historically, a rising whale ratio means large holders are increasingly active on exchanges, likely preparing to sell. This shift often precedes corrections or sharp volatility, especially when retail activity is cooling off. Combining this with stagnant price action below key resistance, the current whale behavior suggests cautious distribution rather than aggressive accumulation. If the whale ratio remains elevated while BTC trades sideways or drops further, it strengthens the case for a liquidity sweep below $100K before any potential continuation higher.

2025-06-18T13:40:59,"Urgent Shift: Bitcoin Mining Giants Expand US Production Amid China Tariffs","BitcoinWorld Urgent Shift: Bitcoin Mining Giants Expand US Production Amid China Tariffs The global landscape of Bitcoin mining is undergoing a significant transformation, largely driven by geopolitical forces. For years, the production of the specialized computer hardware essential for mining, known as ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits), has been dominated by a handful of companies based in China. However, the ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China have created powerful incentives for these manufacturing giants to reconsider their strategies and geographical footprint. This strategic pivot is not just a business decision; it’s a structural shift impacting the entire crypto mining supply chain and raising important questions about national security and economic resilience. Understanding the Giants Driving US Manufacturing Expansion At the heart of this story are three titans of the mining hardware industry: Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT. These companies collectively hold an estimated over 90% share of the global market for Bitcoin mining rigs. Their dominance means that virtually every large-scale Bitcoin mining operation, regardless of its location, relies heavily on their products. For decades, their manufacturing base has been primarily in China, leveraging the country’s established electronics supply chain, infrastructure, and labor force. However, the imposition of tariffs under former President Donald Trump’s administration, specifically targeting goods imported from China, significantly increased the cost of these crucial components for US-based mining operations. These tariffs acted as a direct financial burden, making it more expensive to set up or expand mining facilities in the United States. This economic pressure point became a major catalyst for the Chinese manufacturers to explore alternatives to mitigate the impact and remain competitive in a key market. Why Are China Tariffs Pushing Mining Hardware Production to the US? The primary driver for Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT’s decision to ramp up US manufacturing is the direct financial penalty imposed by the tariffs. Importing ASICs manufactured in China into the United States incurs substantial additional costs, which are ultimately passed on to the customers – the US Bitcoin miners. By establishing production capabilities within the US, these companies can potentially bypass or significantly reduce these tariff-related expenses, making their products more cost-effective for American buyers. Beyond just tariffs, other factors are at play: Market Proximity: The United States has rapidly become one of the largest and most attractive regions for Bitcoin mining globally, thanks to factors like access to abundant, often cheap, energy sources (renewables, natural gas flares) and a favorable regulatory environment in certain states. Having production closer to this major customer base can improve logistics, reduce shipping times and costs, and allow for quicker response to market demand. Supply Chain Resilience: Relying on a single manufacturing hub, especially one in a potentially adversarial geopolitical environment, introduces significant supply chain risks. Diversifying production locations enhances resilience against future trade disputes, export restrictions, or other disruptions. National Security Concerns: As the article notes, the heavy reliance of US infrastructure (including crypto mining, which is seen by some as critical digital infrastructure) on hardware from a geopolitical rival has raised national security concerns. While the manufacturers’ move is primarily economic, it aligns with broader calls for diversifying critical supply chains away from China. Customer Relationships: Local production can facilitate stronger relationships with large institutional mining clients in the US, offering better support, repair services, and potentially customized solutions. Examining the Strategies: How Are the Giants Adapting? Each of the big three is implementing its own version of a localization strategy: Bitmain: As the market leader, Bitmain made an early move, reportedly beginning production in the U.S. in December 2023. This timing, shortly after the U.S. presidential election, suggests a proactive approach to navigate the political landscape and potential future trade policies. Bitmain has previously explored US operations, including mining farms, indicating a long-term interest in the North American market. Canaan: Canaan, another major player, initiated trial manufacturing in April. The timing here is also notable, following discussions around potential new or reinforced tariffs, sometimes referred to informally as ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs in political discourse. Trial manufacturing allows Canaan to test the feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and logistical challenges of US production before committing to a larger scale. MicroBT: The maker of the popular Whatsminer series is focusing on a broader “localization strategy.” This might involve not just manufacturing but also establishing stronger local sales, support, and repair networks. While the specific details of their US production plans might differ, the goal is the same: reduce exposure to trade restrictions and better serve the North American market. It’s important to note that “production” in the US might initially focus on assembly rather than the complex, capital-intensive fabrication of the ASIC chips themselves, which still heavily relies on advanced foundries primarily located in Asia (like TSMC in Taiwan). However, even assembly in the US represents a significant step towards shifting part of the value chain geographically. What Does This Mean for the US Crypto Mining Landscape? The expansion of mining hardware production within the United States has several potential implications for the domestic crypto mining industry: Reduced Costs (Potentially): By avoiding tariffs, the cost of acquiring new mining rigs could decrease for US operators, improving profitability and encouraging further investment in domestic mining infrastructure. Faster Deployment: Shorter supply chains mean quicker delivery times for new equipment, allowing miners to scale their operations more rapidly in response to market conditions. Enhanced Supply Chain Security: Domestic production offers greater predictability and security of supply compared to relying solely on imports subject to geopolitical risks. Job Creation: Establishing and operating manufacturing or assembly plants creates jobs in the US, contributing to the local economy in states that attract these facilities. Development of Domestic Expertise: Increased manufacturing activity can foster the development of a skilled workforce and technical expertise related to ASIC production and maintenance within the US. While the benefits are clear, challenges remain. The cost of labor and manufacturing in the US is generally higher than in China. Sourcing components, many of which are still produced in Asia, could also present logistical hurdles. However, the strategic advantages, particularly tariff avoidance and supply chain security, appear to outweigh these challenges for the major players. Beyond Tariffs: The Long-Term Impact on the Global Mining Supply Chain The shift of Chinese mining hardware manufacturers towards US production is more than a temporary response to trade policy; it signals a potential long-term restructuring of the global Bitcoin mining supply chain. For years, the supply chain has been heavily centralized in East Asia, from chip design and fabrication to assembly and distribution. This move suggests a trend towards decentralization and regionalization. As more production capacity is established outside of China, other regions like North America could develop more robust local ecosystems for mining hardware – including repair centers, component suppliers, and potentially even domestic design and fabrication capabilities in the future. This could lead to a more diversified and resilient global mining network, less susceptible to disruptions in any single country. Furthermore, this trend could encourage the emergence or growth of non-Chinese mining hardware manufacturers, fostering greater competition in a market currently dominated by the big three. While challenging, the opportunity exists for companies in the US or other geopolitically neutral countries to capture market share by offering domestically produced or assembled hardware. Addressing National Security and Supply Chain Concerns The concerns around national security stem from the potential for hardware backdoors or vulnerabilities embedded during the manufacturing process, as well as the strategic risk of relying on a competitor for essential digital infrastructure components. While these concerns are complex and often debated, a shift towards domestic or allied-country production of Bitcoin mining equipment can, in theory, alleviate some of these worries by bringing parts of the supply chain under the jurisdiction and oversight of the host country. Increased US manufacturing of mining hardware contributes to greater supply chain transparency and potentially allows for more stringent security checks and quality control processes that align with US standards and regulations. This is particularly relevant as Bitcoin mining becomes increasingly integrated into the energy sector and attracts larger institutional players. What’s Next? The Future of Mining Hardware Production The success and scale of these initial US production efforts will likely determine the extent of future expansion. Factors to watch include: The evolution of US trade policy towards China. The cost-effectiveness of US manufacturing compared to traditional hubs. The ability to build a skilled workforce and reliable local component supply chains in the US. Demand from US-based mining operations. If these initiatives prove successful, we could see a more permanent shift, with a significant portion of global mining hardware assembly serving the North American market being done locally. This would not only reshape the business models of the major manufacturers but also further solidify North America’s position as a major global hub for crypto mining activity. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Bitcoin Mining The decision by Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT to expand production in the United States marks a pivotal moment for the Bitcoin mining industry. Driven primarily by the economic pressures of China tariffs , this move is accelerating a broader trend towards the regionalization and diversification of the global mining hardware supply chain. While challenges in manufacturing costs and component sourcing remain, the strategic benefits of being closer to a major market like the US, avoiding tariffs, and enhancing supply chain security are compelling. This shift is not just about where machines are made; it’s about building a more resilient, geographically diverse, and potentially more secure foundation for the future of Bitcoin mining worldwide. As the US continues to grow as a mining destination, domestic hardware production could become an increasingly vital component of its digital infrastructure.

2025-06-18T13:34:29,"War Headlines Hit Bitcoin—But Dip Buyers Eye New Highs","Bitcoin price action has been a roller coaster this week, as escalating Middle East tensions and dramatic Washington headlines have triggered sharp intraday swoons—only to be met by stubborn dip-buying that's kept BTC within striking distance of its all-time highs. As Israel and Iran exchange missile strikes and former President Trump takes emergency security meetings, risk appetite worldwide has faltered, but Bitcoin's underlying bullish momentum is undeniable. Geopolitical Shockwaves and Trump's Security Meetings The latest bout of volatility began after reports that Israel had launched its largest attack on Iran in decades, sparking fear of wider regional conflict. It took a turn for the worse after Trump abruptly pulled out of the G7 summit and called for an emergency Situation Room meeting, urging Americans to depart Tehran. The market's reaction was immediate: Bitcoin lost over $2,000 in a matter of hours, and altcoins plummeted even harder, wiping out $80 billion in cryptocurrency market capitalization. Traders were hit with nearly $400 million in liquidations, with leveraged longs being blindsided. Yet, as the dust settled, Bitcoin's price stabilized above $103,000. This kind of resilience is similar to previous wartime shocks, where BTC sold off in the first instance but soon got back on its feet as markets adjusted to the new reality. In fact, historical data shows that after similar events—like the Israel-Gaza war in 2023 and the Iran embassy bombing in 2024—Bitcoin can bounce back within weeks, sometimes even outperforming traditional safe havens like gold. Funding Rates and ETF Inflows Continue to Be Bullish The special thing about this cycle is the speed and size of the bounce. On-chain metrics and derivatives markets show that, even as headlines spooked retail investors, institutional players and seasoned traders viewed the dip as a buying opportunity. Bitcoin perpetual futures funding rates, which temporarily turned negative during panic, have flipped positive again—meaning traders are paying a premium to hold long positions and are expecting higher prices in the future. ETF flows tell the same story. Despite the price decline, U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs gathered over $200 million of net inflows, led by BlackRock's IBIT with $639 million in a single day. Although inflows slowed from last week's record pace, the nine-week streak of positive flows has pushed year-to-date ETF inflows to $13.2 billion. That suggests that institutional investors remain confident in Bitcoin's long-term trajectory, even as short-term volatility shakes out less determined participants. Macro Context: How Bitcoin Behaves In Wartime Bitcoin's relationship with geopolitical risk is evolving. Historically, BTC has been considered a ”digital gold” hedge, but recent cycles have seen it behave more like a risk asset—selling off in conjunction with equities in crises, prior to rebounding as markets stabilize. Bitwise and CoinShares researchers note that Bitcoin's volatility has reduced structurally over time but remains vulnerable to global shocks. But the evidence shows that Bitcoin's post-war recoveries can be quick and decisive. After the COVID crash in 2020, BTC lost half its value within days, only to gain 583% over the next year. In the Russia-Ukraine war during 2022, Bitcoin dropped 20% before gaining 65% over two months. In spite of recent Israel-Iran tensions, BTC's ability to hold key support levels and attract new inflows is a sign of a market that's ageing—and increasingly being driven by institutional money. The Bottom Line Despite war-driven volatility and headline risk, the underlying Bitcoin narrative remains unchanged. Dip-buyers, positive funding rates, and relentless ETF inflows suggest the market's conviction is stronger than fear. If history is any guide, Bitcoin's strength amidst geopolitical shock can yet again set the stage for fresh highs—especially with institutions still buying and traders betting on a V-shaped recovery.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9614/war-headlines-hit-bitcoin-but-dip-buyers-eye-new-highs,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-06-18T13:30:47,"XRP ETF Canada: Evolve Funds Poised for Historic Launch on Toronto Stock Exchange","BitcoinWorld XRP ETF Canada: Evolve Funds Poised for Historic Launch on Toronto Stock Exchange Get ready, Canadian crypto enthusiasts! A potentially significant development is on the horizon for accessing digital assets through traditional investment vehicles. Canada’s Evolve Funds Group has announced its intention to launch the Evolve XRP ETF , bringing the popular cryptocurrency Ripple XRP into the regulated exchange-traded fund space on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). This move could mark a new chapter for investors looking to gain exposure to Ripple XRP without directly holding the digital asset. What is the Evolve XRP ETF and Why Does it Matter? The Evolve XRP ETF is designed to provide investors with exposure to the daily price movements of XRP, the digital asset associated with the Ripple payment network. Unlike buying and storing XRP yourself on a crypto exchange, an ETF trades on a traditional stock exchange like the Toronto Stock Exchange , making it accessible through standard brokerage accounts. This proposed XRP ETF Canada offering is significant for several reasons: Accessibility: It simplifies the investment process for traditional investors who are comfortable with brokerage platforms but might find navigating crypto exchanges and wallets daunting. Regulation: Trading on a regulated exchange like the TSX brings a level of oversight and investor protection not always present in direct crypto markets. Institutional Interest: The availability of an ETF can attract institutional investors who have mandates preventing direct crypto holdings but can invest in regulated fund products. Market Validation: The launch of a dedicated Canada Crypto ETF for XRP, following similar products for Bitcoin and Ethereum, signals growing acceptance and maturity of the digital asset class within Canadian financial markets. The ETF is expected to trade under the ticker symbols XRP (for the Canadian Dollar unhedged units) and XRP.U (for the US Dollar units), pending final approval from the TSX. How Does the Evolve XRP ETF Fit into the Canada Crypto ETF Landscape? Canada has been a leader in approving cryptocurrency ETFs, starting with Bitcoin and Ethereum products. Evolve Funds itself was among the first to launch a Bitcoin ETF (EBIT) and an Ethereum ETF (ETHR) on the TSX. The potential arrival of the Evolve XRP ETF further diversifies the options available to Canadian investors seeking regulated exposure to digital assets. Here’s a quick look at the evolving landscape: Asset Existing ETFs in Canada Evolve’s Offering Bitcoin (BTC) Multiple (e.g., Purpose, Evolve, CI Galaxy) Evolve Bitcoin ETF (EBIT) Ethereum (ETH) Multiple (e.g., Purpose, Evolve, CI Galaxy) Evolve Ether ETF (ETHR) XRP (Ripple) None (as of announcement) Proposed Evolve XRP ETF This expansion suggests growing investor demand and regulatory comfort with offering exposure to a wider range of prominent cryptocurrencies through the traditional financial system. The XRP ETF Canada would be a notable addition, offering access to an asset with a different use case (cross-border payments) compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum. Considering the Evolve XRP ETF: Benefits and Potential Drawbacks Like any investment, the proposed Evolve XRP ETF comes with its own set of potential upsides and considerations. Understanding these is crucial before making any investment decisions. Potential Benefits: Ease of Investment: As mentioned, buying shares of an ETF through a brokerage account is often simpler than managing private keys or dealing with different crypto exchange interfaces. Liquidity: ETFs trade throughout the day on the Toronto Stock Exchange , offering liquidity that can sometimes be challenging on smaller crypto exchanges. No Custody Worries: Investors don’t need to worry about securely storing XRP themselves; the fund handles the custody of the underlying asset. Diversification Potential: For investors building a diversified portfolio, an XRP ETF Canada could offer exposure to the digital asset sector through a regulated product. Potential Drawbacks: Fees: ETFs charge management fees, which can eat into returns over time compared to holding the asset directly (though direct holding has its own costs like exchange fees). Tracking Error: While designed to track the price of XRP, ETFs can sometimes experience minor tracking differences due to operational costs and market dynamics. Regulatory Uncertainty for XRP: While the ETF is regulated in Canada, the underlying asset, Ripple XRP , has faced significant regulatory challenges in other jurisdictions (most notably the ongoing SEC lawsuit in the United States), which can impact its price volatility and future prospects. Market Volatility: The price of XRP, like other cryptocurrencies, is highly volatile. Investing in the ETF means accepting this inherent market risk. Investors should weigh these factors carefully and consider their own risk tolerance and investment goals. What’s Next? The Path to Launch for the Evolve XRP ETF According to reports, the Evolve XRP ETF is currently awaiting final approval from the Toronto Stock Exchange . This is a standard step in the process for listing new financial products. Once approved, the ETF will become available for trading on the TSX under the specified ticker symbols. The exact launch date will depend on the timing of this final regulatory clearance. The launch of this Canada Crypto ETF for XRP could potentially: Increase mainstream investor exposure to Ripple XRP. Potentially impact the liquidity and trading volume of XRP. Further solidify Canada’s position as a leading jurisdiction for regulated crypto investment products. Market participants will be watching closely to see how the ETF is received by investors and what impact it has on the broader crypto market, particularly for Ripple XRP . Actionable Insights for Investors If you are considering investing in the proposed Evolve XRP ETF , here are a few steps you might consider: Stay Informed: Keep an eye out for the official approval announcement from Evolve Funds and the TSX. Understand XRP: Before investing in the ETF, take the time to understand what Ripple XRP is, its technology, use cases, and the regulatory environment surrounding it. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrency markets are volatile. Ensure your investment aligns with your personal risk profile. Consult a Financial Advisor: Consider speaking with a qualified financial advisor to understand how this ETF might fit into your overall investment strategy. Summary: A New Era for XRP Access in Canada? The announcement by Evolve Funds Group regarding the planned launch of the Evolve XRP ETF on the Toronto Stock Exchange is a significant development for the Canadian crypto investment landscape. It represents the potential introduction of the first regulated ETF product offering exposure to Ripple XRP in the country. This move underscores the growing acceptance of digital assets within traditional finance and provides Canadian investors with another avenue to participate in the crypto market through a familiar and regulated structure.

2025-06-18T13:30:38,"Researchers Forecast Bitcoin At $4.3 Million By 2036, Citing Institutional Demand","In a striking forecast, two academic researchers, Murray Rudd and Dennis Porter, have predicted that Bitcoin (BTC) could soar to an astonishing $4.3 million by 2036 if institutional buying trends continue. This prediction was highlighted by market expert Giovanni Incasa, who emphasized the significance of applying rigorous supply-demand theories to Bitcoin’s unique economic structure. Supply Shock Warning Rudd and Porter have employed pure mathematical modeling to analyze Bitcoin’s market dynamics, warning that the impending supply shock could lead to price fluctuations ten times more severe than anything seen to date. Their findings suggest that the effects of this supply shock will result in permanent wealth redistribution, fundamentally altering the landscape of digital assets. Related Reading: On-Chain Analyst Warns: Bitcoin Peak Expected, Altcoins Facing -95% Plunge According to their conservative estimates, the Bitcoin price could reach $2.2 million per coin by 2036, a projection rooted in what they describe as “economic physics.” The researchers note that the current liquid supply of Bitcoin stands at only 11.2 million coins, with an estimated 4 million Bitcoin lost forever due to lost keys and Satoshi Nakamoto’s unspent stash. Their analysis reveals that only half of BTC’s total supply is actively liquid, meaning that even modest institutional purchases could lead to significant supply shortages. Evidence of this trend can be seen in the daily buying habits of US exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have averaged 285 Bitcoin per day since their launch, and the actions of Bitcoin treasury companies that are removing thousands of coins from circulation through debt financing. Senator Cynthia Lummis has also proposed a strategic reserve of one million Bitcoin, which would involve an acquisition of approximately 550 coins per day over five years. The researchers calculate that if 2,000 Bitcoin are removed from circulation daily, the price could reach $106,000—a figure that is already close to today’s trading price of $104,800, suggesting that their mathematical framework is holding true. The crux of the researchers’ findings is that traditional supply curves are not applicable to BTC. Its perfectly inelastic supply creates significant bottlenecks as demand rises, leading to dramatic price increases. They emphasize that institutions that delay their investments risk becoming permanently priced out of the market. Three Scenarios For Bitcoin Rudd and Porter outline three potential scenarios for Bitcoin’s future. In a conservative scenario, with a 20-fold increase in demand and continued institutional adoption leading to 2,000 daily Bitcoin withdrawals, prices could reach $2.2 million by 2036. Their bullish scenario posits a 30-fold demand growth, where Bitcoin could hit $5 million by early 2031. The most extreme, hyperbolic scenario anticipates a 40-fold demand increase, with daily withdrawals escalating to 4,000 Bitcoin, potentially driving prices to $4.3 million by 2036 and valuing Bitcoin at six times the current market cap of gold.

2025-06-18T13:30:36,"XRP Beginner’s Guide — What You Need to Know","If you’re new to crypto or finally taking a closer look at XRP, this guide provides everything you need to understand one of the most practical and widely used digital assets in the space. In a clear and insightful thread on X, well-known crypto analyst Pumpius broke down XRP’s core features and real-world applications, cutting through the noise to focus on facts. Building on that foundation, this guide explores what XRP is, how it works, and why it matters today. What Is XRP? XRP is a digital asset built for real-time, cross-border payments. While Bitcoin was created to function as a decentralized store of value, XRP was specifically designed to make global money transfers faster, cheaper, and more scalable. According to Pumpius, XRP processes transactions in just three to five seconds, costs less than a cent per transaction, and can handle over 1,500 transactions per second. This speed and efficiency are what separate XRP from most other cryptocurrencies. It isn’t meant to replace traditional money, but rather to upgrade how money moves. As Pumpius puts it, “It’s not ‘just another coin. ’ It’s infrastructure.” Beginner’s Guide to $XRP — What You Need to Know If you’re just getting into crypto or finally curious about XRP, this thread breaks down what it is, how it works, and why it matters. No hype. No noise. Just facts. pic.twitter.com/fIqSz4U106 — Pumpius (@pumpius) June 17, 2025 Understanding the XRP Ledger (XRPL) The technology behind XRP is the XRP Ledger , commonly referred to as XRPL. This is the decentralized blockchain network where XRP transactions take place. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which depend on energy-heavy mining, XRPL uses a consensus mechanism that doesn’t require mining at all. This makes it environmentally friendly, incredibly fast, and highly reliable, with the ledger closing every few seconds. Pumpius explains it best: “Think of XRPL as the highway. XRP is the car.” The ledger also comes with advanced capabilities, including a built-in decentralized exchange (DEX), native tokenization, and support for real-world assets like stablecoins, NFTs, and even tokenized biotech data. This makes the XRPL not just a payments network but a powerful platform for developers and institutions building on-chain solutions. Who Uses XRP and the XRPL? XRP’s real-world use extends well beyond trading. Ripple, the fintech company closely associated with XRP, uses it to develop global payment solutions for financial institutions. Through RippleNet and On-Demand Liquidity, XRP helps banks and remittance companies settle international payments within seconds, removing the need for pre-funded accounts and reducing costs. Pumpius highlights that XRP and XRPL aren’t just used by banks. Developers are building a wide range of projects on the ledger, including DeFi protocols, tokenized asset platforms, and even biotech applications such as XRP Healthcare and DNA Protocol. These projects demonstrate that XRP is not just about finance; it’s about enabling secure and efficient value transfer across multiple industries. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP vs. Other Cryptocurrencies Each major cryptocurrency serves a different role. Bitcoin is widely viewed as a store of value, often referred to as digital gold . Ethereum dominates the smart contract space but faces persistent issues with network congestion and high fees . XRP, in contrast, is optimized for real-time value transfers and liquidity provisioning. Pumpius summarizes it this way: “XRP isn’t trying to replace banks—it’s replacing their plumbing.” Instead of tearing down the financial system, XRP enhances the infrastructure behind it. Legal Status and Regulatory Clarity One of the most significant milestones in XRP’s journey came in 2023, when U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not a security when sold on digital asset exchanges. This decision gave XRP a rare level of regulatory clarity in the United States—something that most cryptocurrencies still lack. Pumpius rightly called it “one of the most important wins in crypto history.” The ruling allowed XRP to be relisted on major U.S. exchanges and restored institutional confidence in the asset. How to Store XRP Safely Pumpius stresses the importance of self-custody for those holding XRP. Rather than leaving assets on exchanges, where users don’t control their private keys, he advises using secure wallets such as Xaman, Tangem, or Ledger hardware wallets. As he puts it, “Not your keys = not your coins.” In crypto, maintaining control of your assets is essential. Final Thoughts XRP is not built on hype. As Pumpius concluded, “XRP is not hype. It’s not a meme. It’s one of the most adopted, fastest, and legally clarified assets in crypto.” With a clear use case, powerful infrastructure, and growing adoption across sectors, XRP stands out as a practical tool in the future of finance and decentralized value transfer. For beginners seeking a serious and credible introduction to digital assets, XRP is a smart place to start. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.
