2025-06-18T15:57:07,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Dips As Trump’s Iran Threats Spark Macroeconomic Uncertainty","Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market tumbled on Tuesday as the conflict between Israel and Iran escalated. The US, under President Trump, has also taken a hardline stance, demanding the complete disarmament of Iran’s nuclear program. Trump also threatened Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. BTC has struggled this week, losing momentum after reaching an intraday high of $108,944. The flagship cryptocurrency plunged to a low of $103,395 before moving to current levels. Bitcoin (BTC) Tumbles After Trump’s Remarks Spark Panic Bitcoin tumbled after President Trump threatened Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, claiming the leader was an easy target as the US and its allies knew where he was hiding. Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, stating, “We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there — We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. We don’t want missiles shot at civilians or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” He also demanded Iran’s unconditional surrender. Trump’s comments come amid an escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. BTC dipped over $1,000 after Trump’s comments, dropping to a low of $103,395. Chinese Bitcoin ASIC Makers Bringing Production To The US Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT are set to begin US production as tariff pressures continue to grow. The three companies collectively produce nearly all of the world’s Bitcoin mining application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). The shift is in response to reciprocal tariffs imposed on China by US President Donald Trump. Chinese goods and services are subject to a 25% tariff after previously crossing 100%. Bitmain is responsible for 82% of Bitcoin ASIC production, while MicroBT accounts for 15% and Canaan around 2%. This gives them a combined 99% share of the global ASIC market. A study by the University of Cambridge noted, “The digital mining hardware market exhibits an oligopolistic structure, with the top three manufacturers — Bitmain, MicroBT, and Canaan — commanding over 99% market share.” This is not the first time geopolitics has impacted the Bitcoin mining industry. In early April, Hashlabs Mining CEO Jaran Mellerud had said that sweeping tariffs could lead to a collapse in demand for Bitcoin mining rigs in the US. Mellerud stated that tariffs would benefit mining operations based outside the US, as manufacturers would look to sell surplus inventory abroad at a lower cost. The Blockchain Group Adds To Bitcoin (BTC) Holdings Technology firm The Blockchain Group has added to its Bitcoin reserves, purchasing 182 BTC for around $19.6 million. The latest purchase takes the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 1,653 BTC , valued at around $170 million at current prices. The latest acquisition was funded by a series of recently completed convertible bond issuances of around 18 million euros ($20.7 million). Notable investors include UTXO Management, Moonlight Capital, TOBAM, and Ludovic Chechin-Laurans. According to the announcement, each investor purchased a different part of the company’s bond offerings. The Blockchain Group claimed a year-to-date Bitcoin yield of 1,173%, reflecting a notable increase in the ratio of Bitcoin held to its fully diluted share count. The company has added 469 BTC since the beginning of the year and reported over $49 million in gains in the value of its holdings. The acquisition cost stands at $103,000 per Bitcoin, lower than current market prices. The company is also planning to purchase an additional 70 BTC , which would take its holdings past 1,700 BTC . Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has rebounded to reclaim $105,000, with the price up nearly 1%, trading around $105,235. The flagship cryptocurrency has struggled to regain momentum after dropping from $110,000 last week as market sentiment flipped to bearish. As a result, it dipped to a low of $102,832 by Friday before recovering over the weekend. Analysts believe BTC still risks further downside but must stay above $102,000-$103,000 to remain on track for a potential recovery. Bitfinex analysts stated in a market report, “If Bitcoin can hold above the $102,000 - $103,000 region for a sustained period, it would suggest that the market is absorbing the selling pressure effectively.” They added that while some downside risk persists thanks to macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions, it presents a potentially risky yet rewarding opportunity for investors. “This environment now reflects a high-risk, high-reward opportunity for upside continuation if buyer confidence returns.” The analysts added that even if the price trends lower, the decline will not be as steep as seen during previous years. Some analysts presented a bleaker outlook, believing that current market and geopolitical conditions could push BTC below the psychological $100,000 price level. Some, like analyst Doctor Profit, believe the flagship cryptocurrency could retreat as low as $93,000. Markets were optimistic about BTC testing its all-time high after it surged past $110,000 last week. However, those hopes were dashed after Israel carried out airstrikes on Iran. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs continued to see strong inflows despite market uncertainty. BTC traded in positive territory over the previous weekend, rising nearly 3% and moving to $104,378 on Friday. Price action remained positive over the weekend as the flagship cryptocurrency rose 1.15% on Saturday and registered a marginal decline on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,784. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as BTC surged over 4% to cross the 20-day SMA and $110,000 to settle at $110,251. The price fell to an intraday low of $108,335 on Tuesday but recovered to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,253. BTC lost momentum on Wednesday, falling 1.42% and settling at $108,687. Source: TradingView Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as BTC fell nearly 3%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,828. The price plunged to an intraday low of $102,832 on Friday. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase, reclaim $106,000, and settle at $106,106. Price action was mixed over the weekend as BTC fell 0.59% on Saturday before registering a marginal rise on Sunday to settle at $105,562. BTC raced to an intraday high of $108,944 on Monday as it started the week positively. Despite the positive start, it could not stay at this level and settled at $106,806, ultimately registering an increase of 1.18%. Sentiment turned bearish on Tuesday thanks to the deteriorating situation in the Middle East. As a result, BTC fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $105,000 to settle at $104,518, but not before dropping to a low of $103,395. The current session sees the price marginally up as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-18T15:48:44,"Sberbank spearheads Russia’s AI ambition with GigaChat","Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank, is set to launch a version of its own Large Language Model (LLM), GigaChat, which is said to have advanced reasoning capabilities. First Deputy CEO Alexander Vedyakhin said in an interview that the model’s beta version is currently in testing and would be rolled out in the near future. Sberbank spearheads Russia’s AI ambition with GigaChat Most LLMs are primarily designed for chat and basic tasks; however, Sberbank claims that GigaChat features advanced reasoning capabilities, which make it capable of solving complex science and mathematical problems, and even code, making it on par with other models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT . Vedyakhin admits that the model is about six to nine months behind AI leaders like the US and China. However, he emphasized that GigaChat is tailored towards Russian language fluency, domestic cloud performance, and alignment with the local corporate needs. Vedyakhin believes this specialization makes GigaChat more valuable and preferred by Russian clients. He also claims that about 15,000 Russian companies are already adopting the model. Sberbank isn’t content with solo advances. In February 2025, Vedyakhin revealed plans to conduct joint research on AI projects with China. “Sberbank has many scientists. Through them, we plan to conduct joint research projects with researchers from China”. This was driven by Russia’s strategic “no limits” partnership and the emerging innovation of the low-cost LLM model, DeepSeek. The partnership also echoes Russia’s ambitions to enhance sovereignty and forge deeper ties with BRICS nations that are advanced in tech fields. Russia’s Roscosmos space corporation also plans to embed the GigaChat model into the International Space Station’s (ISS) IT systems. Roscosmos chief Dmitry Bakanov said the next ISS mission, planned for November 27, will deliver everything needed for the model integration. Bakanov said this will provide direct assistance for the cosmonauts, helping the crew process satellite imagery and increase image resolution. Sberbank is creating a hybrid tech-finance powerhouse Parallel to its AI drive, Sberbank is also taking a dive into the crypto market. In early June, it launched structured bonds, which are tied to the Bitcoin price and the USD/RUB exchange rates. The bonds are available over-the-counter (OTC) for qualified investors on the Moscow Stock Exchange. It also plans to launch more crypto exchange-traded products, including BTC futures. This move follows the Bank of Russia’s regulatory stance, which permits regulated crypto-based instruments for accredited investors. With the simultaneous dive into AI and crypto finance, Sberbank is positioning itself as an innovator in both emerging fields. It also reflects Russia’s efforts to reinforce its domestic capabilities and carve out its share in global technology. The coming months will reveal whether this pivot will pay off or stretch the bank thin in a highly competitive market, especially with the search engine Yandex, Sberbank’s main domestic rival in AI, saying its LLM has reasoning functionality.

2025-06-18T15:40:57,"Bitcoin: The Blockchain Group Achieves Milestone in BTC Holdings with Strategic Purchase","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: The Blockchain Group Achieves Milestone in BTC Holdings with Strategic Purchase In a move signaling growing corporate confidence in digital assets, The Blockchain Group, a French firm focused on blockchain technology, has significantly increased its Bitcoin holdings. This recent acquisition is part of a clear strategic pivot towards becoming a Bitcoin treasury company, placing them among a growing list of publicly traded entities embracing digital assets. Boosting The Blockchain Group’s BTC Holdings The core of this recent news revolves around a substantial purchase. The Blockchain Group acquired an additional 182 Bitcoin (BTC). This acquisition, valued at $19.6 million, brings their total reported BTC holdings to an impressive 1,653 Bitcoin. This isn’t just a minor addition; it represents a significant commitment and expansion of their digital asset reserves. The scale of this investment highlights the company’s belief in Bitcoin as a valuable asset for their corporate treasury. Increasing their BTC holdings by 182 coins demonstrates a proactive approach to managing their balance sheet in the current economic climate. Funding The Blockchain Group’s Bitcoin Strategy How did The Blockchain Group fund this notable purchase? According to reports, the $19.6 million acquisition was financed through a combination of convertible bonds and the conversion of share warrants. This approach indicates a deliberate financial strategy to acquire assets without solely relying on existing cash reserves, potentially leveraging future equity or debt structures. This funding method is also tied to a broader initiative announced earlier. On June 17, the firm revealed it had successfully raised $7.7 million. This capital raise was specifically earmarked to support its stated ambition: to transform into a Bitcoin treasury company . The recent Bitcoin purchase is a direct execution of this strategic fundraising and long-term vision. What is a Crypto Treasury Strategy? The term Crypto treasury strategy refers to a corporate finance approach where a company holds cryptocurrencies, primarily Bitcoin, on its balance sheet as a primary treasury reserve asset, alongside or instead of traditional assets like cash or gold. Companies adopting this strategy often view Bitcoin as: A hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. A potential store of value with long-term appreciation potential. A way to diversify corporate assets. A signal of innovation and forward-thinking in the digital economy. For The Blockchain Group , adopting this strategy means aligning their corporate finance with the very technology sector they operate within. It’s a bold move that positions them uniquely in the market. The Rise of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption The Blockchain Group’s move is part of a larger, undeniable trend: Institutional Bitcoin adoption . Over the past few years, we’ve seen a growing number of corporations, investment funds, and even some governments explore or actively acquire Bitcoin. Companies like MicroStrategy have become synonymous with this trend, holding vast amounts of Bitcoin on their balance sheets. This increasing Institutional Bitcoin adoption signifies a maturing market. It suggests that Bitcoin is moving beyond just individual retail investors and is being recognized by larger, more conservative financial players as a legitimate asset class. Each company that adds Bitcoin to its treasury validates this trend further. Why Companies Embrace Bitcoin: Benefits of BTC Holdings So, why are companies like The Blockchain Group deciding to accumulate significant BTC holdings ? The motivations are varied but often include: Inflation Hedge: With global central banks expanding monetary supply, companies seek assets perceived as scarce and resistant to devaluation. Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it an attractive option. Potential for Appreciation: Despite volatility, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term growth potential, offering the possibility of increasing the value of corporate reserves. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin provides diversification away from traditional financial assets which may be correlated with economic cycles or inflation risks. Balance Sheet Strength: For some, holding Bitcoin is seen as a way to strengthen the balance sheet and signal financial prudence in an uncertain economic environment. Alignment with Mission: For blockchain-focused companies like The Blockchain Group , holding Bitcoin aligns their financial strategy with their core business and values. Navigating the Challenges of a Bitcoin Treasury While the benefits are compelling, a Crypto treasury strategy is not without its challenges. Companies must navigate: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings, which can impact the reported value of corporate holdings and earnings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, posing potential risks and compliance challenges. Accounting Complexities: Accounting for Bitcoin holdings can be complex, often requiring frequent impairment testing based on market price fluctuations. Security Risks: Storing significant amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to protect against hacks and theft. Public Perception: While increasingly accepted, holding Bitcoin can still be viewed with skepticism by some investors or stakeholders. Actionable Insights for the Future The actions of companies like The Blockchain Group provide valuable insights. Their commitment to a Bitcoin treasury strategy , funded through strategic means, suggests a long-term view on the asset. This reinforces the narrative of increasing Institutional Bitcoin adoption and signals that more corporate entities may follow suit as the market matures and infrastructure improves. For investors and market watchers, monitoring corporate BTC holdings is becoming an important metric. It indicates not only direct buying pressure but also a fundamental shift in how some businesses perceive and utilize digital assets. Conclusion The Blockchain Group’s latest acquisition of 182 Bitcoin , bringing their total to 1,653 BTC, is a significant step in their stated mission to become a Bitcoin treasury company . Funded strategically and supported by recent capital raises, this move underscores the growing trend of Institutional Bitcoin adoption . While challenges exist, the benefits of potentially hedging against inflation and diversifying assets are clearly driving this corporate pivot towards accumulating BTC holdings . As more companies explore or adopt similar strategies, the landscape of corporate finance continues to evolve, further integrating digital assets into the global economy.

2025-06-18T15:34:31,"Four U.S. Firms Commit $844M to Crypto Investments, Target Bitcoin and HYPE","At least four publicly traded companies in the U.S. announced a combined $844 million in fresh capital commitments toward cryptocurrencies on Tuesday, signaling a growing appetite for digital assets across diverse sectors. The largest contribution came from DDC Enterprise Ltd, which secured $528 million to aggressively build its Bitcoin (BTC) treasury . DDC raised the amount through a mix of a $300 million convertible note, a $200 million credit facility, and a $26 million equity investment. Major investors included Anson Funds and the venture capital arm of Animoca Brands. The company declared plans to acquire 5,000 BTC over the next three years, furthering its goal of building the “world’s most valuable Bitcoin treasury.” DDC had earlier purchased 21 BTC on May 23, marking its first foray into crypto by trading $2.28 million worth of equity. Fold and BitMine Expand Bitcoin Holdings Fold Holdings Inc., a Bitcoin financial services firm, said it secured a $250 million equity purchase facility. Proceeds will be primarily used to acquire additional BTC. If executed in full, the funds could add up to 2,390 BTC to Fold’s treasury at current market prices. Even a partial allocation would significantly bolster the firm’s current holding of 1,490 BTC. The funding agreement allows Fold to issue new shares through a private placement, pending SEC registration approval. Separately, BitMine Immersion Technologies, a Bitcoin mining equipment rental company, announced it had purchased $16.3 million worth of BTC using proceeds from a recent stock offering. The firm now owns 154.16 BTC, with an average purchase price of $106,033. BitMine said the acquisition aligns with a broader strategic pivot toward accumulating Bitcoin through both mining and capital raises. Eyenovia Bets Big on HYPE Token In a move that extends beyond Bitcoin, biotech firm Eyenovia revealed a $50 million private placement to acquire and stake Hyperliquid’s native HYPE token . The company plans to accumulate over 1 million HYPE tokens — currently worth around $40.1 million — and will stake them via Anchorage Digital. The company, which specializes in digital eye examination technology, also announced a full rebrand to “Hyperion DeFi” with the ticker symbol HYPD. It appointed Hyunsu Jung as Chief Investment Officer to lead its DeFi strategy. Jung called Hyperliquid “one of the fastest growing, highest-revenue generating blockchains in the world.” The post Four U.S. Firms Commit $844M to Crypto Investments, Target Bitcoin and HYPE appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",thecoinrise,https://thecoinrise.com/four-u-s-firms-commit-844m-to-crypto-investments-target-bitcoin-and-hype/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION","Bitcoin News|Bitcoin DDC|Crypto Treasury",cryptocompare
2025-06-18T15:30:55,"Altcoin Alert: Expert Reveals Hottest Opportunities For The Summer Season","As geopolitical tensions in the Middle East continue to impact cryptocurrency prices, with Bitcoin (BTC) recently dipping below the $105,000 mark, market analyst VirtualBacon has shared insights suggesting that altcoins are gearing up for a potentially robust summer. Emerging AI Memecoins In a recent update on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), he highlighted several promising developments within the altcoin space. VirtualBacon pointed to an emerging wave of AI-focused Layer-1 blockchain projects, many backed by prominent figures in both the cryptocurrency and traditional finance sectors. He mentioned several names to watch, including Sahara Labs, Sentient AGI, and Gaianet, among others. While these projects have yet to release tokens, many are expected to conduct airdrops or early access rounds, presenting opportunities for early investors. Related Reading: On-Chain Analyst Warns: Bitcoin Peak Expected, Altcoins Facing -95% Plunge For those seeking “higher-risk, high-reward investments,” VirtualBacon noted the impressive performance of artificial intelligence (AI) agent memecoins. He cited the launch of IRIS, which skyrocketed from a $220,000 fully diluted valuation (FDV) to $120 million, representing a 600x return. Platforms such as Virtuals, CreatorBid, and SeedifyFund are turning user engagement into allocation opportunities, likening this phenomenon to a form of airdrop farming on steroids. In addition, VirtualBacon highlighted a relatively overlooked area: Bittensor subnet tokens. He mentioned that seasoned investors can now acquire early-stage subnets directly on Bittensor’s chain, with projects like SN65_TPN and inference_labs raising capital through token auctions at valuations below $4 million. Stablecoins Take Center Stage Turning to real-world assets (RWAs), VirtualBacon advised focusing on mid-cap infrastructure projects with tangible revenue streams. He pointed to CHEX and CPOOL, which has shown consistent upward movement, as examples of promising investments. Another emerging narrative is the merger and acquisition activity involving public companies and crypto projects. VirtualBacon noted that Tron is set to go public through a Nasdaq reverse merger, while Mixie has been acquired by Netcapital, which boasts a team that includes notable figures like Tim Draper and a co-founder of Helium. A particularly intriguing development is World Liberty Financial (WLF), co-founded by Eric and Donald Jr. Trump, which aims to become a major player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. With plans for its own stablecoin, USD1, and expected to launch in October, the token could have an estimated FDV of $10–15 billion, a conservative projection given its potential. VirtualBacon also pointed out that stablecoins are becoming central to macroeconomic strategies. Tether now ranks as the fifth-largest holder of US Treasuries, highlighting the increasing need for buyers in the market. The analyst urged investors to keep an eye on stablecoin projects that integrate artificial intelligence technology and yield generation, such as USD1, Circle’s USDC, and others. Liquidity Shifts To Altcoin Platforms In the gaming sector, liquidity is coalescing around BlackholeDex, a decentralized exchange (DEX) backed by the AVAX Foundation. With a fee-sharing model similar to Aerodrome and Shadow, BlackholeDex has launched veNFT staking, aligning long-term incentives for users. Related Reading: Ethereum Slows Down In June: Historical Data Says More Losses To Come Lastly, in the Solana ecosystem, Saros DLMM is emerging as a strong competitor to existing platforms like Jupiter and Meteora, utilizing similar bucket-based liquidity pools but with lower fees. It also plans a RADY meme airdrop for SAROS stakers, which could attract early adopters and fuel rapid growth, thus closing the list of highlighted altcoins. As of this writing, Ethereum, the market’s leading altcoin, is trading at $2,521. It has consolidated above this level after dropping sharply from its two-week high of $2,878.

2025-06-18T15:30:26,"Bitcoin Reserve Bill Enters Ukrainian Parliament In Historic Move","Ukraine’s Verkhovna Rada has registered draft law No. 13356, a measure that would add “virtual assets” such as Bitcoin to the roster of instruments the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) may hold in its gold-and-foreign-currency reserves. The bill was filed on 10 June during the legislature’s 13th session of the ninth convocation and lists eight cross-party sponsors, including first deputy finance-committee chair Yaroslav Zheleznyak. The parliamentary bill card confirms that the Finance, Tax and Customs Policy Committee has been designated main rapporteur, with the Digital Transformation, Budget, Anti-Corruption and EU-Integration committees assigned as co-reviewers. Ukraine Introduces Bill To Add Bitcoin To NBU Reserves According to an explanatory note published by the LigaZakon legal portal, the draft would insert virtual assets into the list of internationally recognised reserve assets under the 1999 Law “On the National Bank of Ukraine.” It would also authorise three new channels for acquiring such assets—direct market purchases, acceptance of income denominated in virtual assets and borrowings of virtual assets from multilateral lenders or foreign central banks—and would permit their disposal either through open-market sales for monetary-policy purposes or through repayment of virtual-asset liabilities to official creditors. Zheleznyak emphasises that the language is permissive rather than compulsory. “We give the National Bank the right to include virtual assets in Ukraine’s reserves. How, when and how much is left entirely to the regulator,” he told Korrespondent.net after the filing, adding that the proposal “does not oblige” the NBU but positions Ukraine “within global financial innovation.” In a separate comment to business daily LIGA.net he stressed that timing, method and volume would remain “the discretion of the central bank,” reiterating that the bill is written broadly on purpose. The full text of the bill has yet to be posted on the Rada portal; several Ukrainian legal outlets note that the PDF remains inaccessible as of 18 June. Nonetheless, the outline now before committees is the clearest legislative attempt to date to give the NBU explicit authority to hold Bitcoin alongside its existing reserve assets—monetary gold, IMF Special Drawing Rights, foreign-currency cash, and high-grade securities. Ukraine’s international reserves stood at $44.53 billion on 1 June, according to the NBU data cited by Sudova Yurydychna Hazeta. Supporters argue that allowing a crypto component would diversify that stockpile and could serve as a back-up settlement rail if wartime disruptions sever traditional channels. If enacted, Kyiv would join a very small group of sovereigns whose law explicitly permits Bitcoin to be held as a reserve asset; El Salvador , which disclosed a strategic holding of just over 6,200 BTC, remains the only country currently reporting such positions. Under Rada procedure the draft now awaits a first-reading recommendation from the Finance Committee, after which it can be scheduled for plenary debate. No timetable has been announced, but the bill’s cross-factional sponsorship and the absence of immediate objections from the central bank suggest the proposal will receive serious consideration in the coming months.

2025-06-18T15:30:09,"K33 Secures $8.88M for Ambitious Bitcoin Acquisition","BitcoinWorld K33 Secures $8.88M for Ambitious Bitcoin Acquisition In the ever-evolving world of digital assets, a significant trend continues to gain momentum: companies strategically adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. This isn’t just for tech giants anymore. Recently, Swedish Crypto Broker , K33, formerly known as Skilling, made waves with an announcement that underscores this growing institutional confidence in the leading cryptocurrency. K33 is embarking on a substantial BTC Acquisition plan, aiming to purchase up to 1,000 BTC, funded by a successful capital raise. What is K33’s Bold Bitcoin Acquisition Plan? K33, a prominent player in the Nordic crypto market, recently revealed its ambitious plan to significantly increase its holdings of the flagship digital asset. The company announced on its official website a successful fundraising round, securing SEK 85 million, which translates to approximately $8.88 million USD. This capital was raised through a directed share issue, a common method for companies to quickly raise funds by selling shares directly to selected investors. The primary stated purpose of this substantial capital injection is to finance the firm’s strategic goal of acquiring up to 1,000 Bitcoin . At current market prices, 1,000 BTC represents a considerable asset base, potentially valued in the tens of millions of dollars, depending on the exact timing and price of the purchases. This move signals a strong conviction from K33 ‘s leadership in the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin. The decision to fund this BTC Acquisition through a share issue indicates investor support for K33 ‘s strategic direction. It allows the company to use external capital rather than existing operational funds to build its Bitcoin reserves, potentially preserving liquidity for other business needs. Why Would a Crypto Broker Pursue Corporate Crypto Holdings? One might ask why a Crypto Broker , whose core business is facilitating crypto trading for clients, would want to hold a significant amount of Bitcoin on its own balance sheet. This strategic decision is multifaceted and aligns with broader trends in Corporate Crypto adoption. Several key reasons likely underpin K33 ‘s move: Balance Sheet Strength and Asset Diversification: Holding Bitcoin can be seen as a way to diversify the company’s treasury assets beyond traditional fiat currencies and investments. Given Bitcoin’s potential for appreciation, it could enhance the overall value and strength of the company’s balance sheet over time. Long-Term Conviction in Bitcoin: As a Crypto Broker , K33 is deeply embedded in the crypto ecosystem. Holding Bitcoin signals a strong belief in its future as a store of value and a global reserve asset. This aligns their corporate strategy with the asset class they serve. Enhanced Credibility and Trust: By holding a substantial amount of Bitcoin , K33 demonstrates to its clients and the market that it has ‘skin in the game.’ This can build trust and credibility, showing they are not just facilitating trading but are also participants and believers in the market’s long-term potential. Potential for New Products and Services: A significant BTC Acquisition could potentially pave the way for K33 to offer new financial products or services backed by their Bitcoin holdings, although the announcement specifically mentions treasury purposes. This strategy positions K33 not just as a facilitator but also as an active participant in the Corporate Crypto movement. Understanding the Mechanics: Funding the BTC Acquisition The SEK 85 million ($8.88 million) was raised through a directed share issue. This means that new shares of K33 were created and sold directly to a pre-selected group of investors, rather than through a public offering. This method is often faster and more efficient for companies needing to raise capital quickly for specific purposes, like a significant asset purchase. The funds raised from this share issue will provide the capital needed for the planned BTC Acquisition . K33 will then use this cash to purchase Bitcoin on the open market or through over-the-counter (OTC) desks, aiming to accumulate up to 1,000 BTC. The execution of this purchase will depend on market conditions and K33 ‘s trading strategy to minimize price impact and acquire the asset efficiently. It’s important to note that the value of the acquired Bitcoin will fluctuate with market prices, introducing volatility to K33 ‘s balance sheet. However, the decision to proceed suggests that K33 and its investors are comfortable with this volatility, viewing Bitcoin as a long-term holding rather than a short-term speculation. What are the Potential Benefits for K33? Embarking on this significant BTC Acquisition strategy offers several potential upsides for K33 : Asset Appreciation: If the price of Bitcoin increases over time, the value of K33 ‘s holdings will grow, positively impacting the company’s net worth and potentially its share price. Increased Market Confidence: This move can be perceived positively by the market, signaling that K33 is confident in the future of the asset class it operates within. This could attract more clients and investors. Enhanced Brand Positioning: Holding substantial Bitcoin reserves strengthens K33 ‘s position as a serious and committed player in the crypto space, differentiating it from brokers who might only facilitate trading without holding significant assets themselves. Potential Hedging: For a Crypto Broker , holding Bitcoin could potentially act as a hedge against certain market dynamics or regulatory shifts, though this is a complex consideration. These benefits are contingent on the performance of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Are There Challenges or Risks Involved? While the potential benefits are clear, a significant BTC Acquisition also comes with inherent risks, especially for a publicly traded company like K33 : Market Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price swings. A significant downturn in the Bitcoin price could negatively impact the value of K33 ‘s holdings and its overall financial performance. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and companies holding them is still evolving in many jurisdictions, including Sweden and the broader EU. Changes in regulations could impact the value or usability of K33 ‘s Bitcoin holdings. Execution Risk: Acquiring a large amount like 1,000 BTC requires careful execution to avoid significant price impact during the purchase process. Shareholder Reaction: While the share issue was successful, the long-term reaction of shareholders to K33 ‘s performance will be tied, in part, to the performance of its Bitcoin reserves. Managing these risks will be crucial for K33 as it integrates this Corporate Crypto strategy. How Does K33’s Move Compare to Other Corporate Crypto Strategies? Corporate Crypto adoption gained significant attention with companies like MicroStrategy making massive BTC Acquisition s, positioning Bitcoin as their primary treasury reserve asset. Tesla also made headlines with its Bitcoin purchase, although its strategy has been more dynamic. While K33 ‘s target of 1,000 BTC is smaller in scale compared to MicroStrategy’s hundreds of thousands of BTC, its significance lies in the nature of the company. K33 is a Crypto Broker – a company whose very existence is tied to the digital asset market. Their decision to hold substantial Bitcoin on their balance sheet is arguably a stronger endorsement of the asset class than that of a software company or an electric vehicle manufacturer. It reflects a belief that holding the underlying asset is a core part of being a Crypto Broker in the modern financial landscape. This move might encourage other crypto-native companies to consider similar strategies. Here’s a simple comparison: Company Primary Business Approx. BTC Holdings (as of late data/announcement) Funding Method (for BTC) MicroStrategy Business Intelligence Software ~220,000+ BTC Debt issuance, Equity offerings, Cash flows Tesla Electric Vehicles, Energy ~10,000+ BTC (fluctuates) Cash flows K33 Crypto Broker Target: up to 1,000 BTC Directed Share Issue (Note: BTC holdings are approximate and change frequently.) This table highlights that while the scale differs, the intent – integrating Bitcoin into the corporate treasury – is a shared strategic goal across different types of companies engaging in Corporate Crypto . Actionable Insights: What Can Investors Learn from This K33 Strategy? The K33 announcement provides several insights for both institutional and retail investors interested in the crypto market: Confirmation of Institutional Interest: This move further validates the trend of companies viewing Bitcoin as a legitimate treasury asset. It’s not just a few outliers; the movement is broadening. Belief in Long-Term Value: Companies making significant BTC Acquisition s, funded by external capital, are signaling a strong long-term bullish outlook on Bitcoin . They are willing to take on the volatility risk for potential future gains. Diversification Strategy: The rationale behind Corporate Crypto adoption often includes diversification. Investors might consider how digital assets could fit into their own diversified portfolios. Focus on Crypto-Native Companies: For investors looking for exposure to companies directly involved in the crypto space, examining the balance sheet strategies of Crypto Broker s and exchanges can be informative. K33 ‘s strategy is one example. While K33 ‘s specific situation is unique to its business model and market position, the underlying motivations and strategic considerations are relevant to understanding the broader trend of Corporate Crypto adoption. In conclusion, K33 ‘s successful $8.88 million raise to fund the purchase of up to 1,000 Bitcoin is a notable development in the Corporate Crypto space. It highlights the increasing confidence of companies, especially those within the digital asset industry, in holding Bitcoin as a strategic treasury asset. This move by a prominent Crypto Broker like K33 not only strengthens its own position but also serves as another data point in the ongoing institutional adoption narrative surrounding Bitcoin .

2025-06-18T15:28:38,"Best Crypto To Buy Now As EU’s Bearish View On Bitcoin Starts to Fade","While Asia and the U.S. have taken turns fueling bull cycles, the European Union, long regarded as one of crypto’s most skeptical zones, is now stepping into the arena with real intent. For years, hesitation ruled policy. Now, the hesitation is fading. What’s being introduced now is a framework designed not to restrict crypto, but to regulate it into the mainstream. With clear licensing pathways, unified passporting rights, and accelerating approvals for top-tier exchanges, the EU is positioning itself as a serious contender in the next phase of crypto growth. What was once a fortress of red tape is quickly becoming one of crypto’s most strategic gateways. Across continents, institutional adoption is accelerating, and governments that once dismissed crypto outright are now establishing frameworks to bring it into the mainstream. It’s visible in the pace of approvals, licensing, and market access granted to some of the world’s largest crypto exchanges. The EU Greenlights Crypto’s Next Phase of Expansion For years, Europe’s relationship with crypto was defined by caution and constraint. That posture has changed. Since the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation officially came into effect, the speed at which top exchanges have begun establishing a legal presence inside the bloc has surprised even longtime industry watchers. Malta and other jurisdictions have moved quickly to approve licenses for Gemini, Crypto.com, and OKX; companies that represent massive volumes of daily trading activity. These aren’t fringe players; they are foundational pillars of the global crypto economy. Coinbase is now finalizing entry through Luxembourg, a move that underscores the new priority status the EU is commanding. MiCA is coming into full force by the end of June.Not just for exchanges or stablecoins, but for anyone building infrastructure for tokenized assets in Europe.MiCA = Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation.It became law in the EU last year. Parts are already in force, like… — Dusk (@DuskFoundation) June 12, 2025 The deeper significance lies in the mechanics. Under MiCA, any exchange approved in one EU country can legally offer services across all 27 member states. This passporting effect radically simplifies expansion and removes the need to battle with inconsistent national rules. For large exchanges, this opens the door to a highly banked, economically mature, and regulation-first population, all of which are ideal conditions for crypto adoption at scale. Beyond just access, the EU has reinforced its stance with coordinated enforcement rules, standardized anti-money laundering procedures, and a formal crypto tax reporting framework through CARF. Rather than pushing exchanges away with ambiguous policy, the EU is now offering the one thing the crypto sector has long craved: legal clarity paired with market opportunity. If momentum continues at this pace, the European crypto market won’t just grow. It could become the most professionally regulated in the world. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Tokens that Could Attract the European Investor-Base Solaxy Solaxy is simply building the bridge the current crypto infrastructure desperately needs, one that connects Solana’s speed and Ethereum’s reach under a single layer. For investors and developers within the European Union, this approach holds particular appeal. As the MiCA framework begins to shape the future of compliant blockchain operations across the continent, Solaxy’s architecture answers a very real demand: performance without compromise. Speed without security risks, and compatibility without chaos. Europe’s crypto evolution will not be driven by hype coins or experimental chains. It will be built on ecosystems that can support both institutional onboarding and public utility. That is where Solaxy shines. Its network is fast, cost-efficient, and engineered to handle high-volume transactions, making it a prime choice for both consumer-facing apps and backend enterprise infrastructure. It's time to break out the fireworks. 🛸🪐54M Raised! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/j4o0a6bqDn — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) June 17, 2025 The project is already enroute to being listed across top exchanges, since the ongoing presale is likely to end soon, having raised $54 million at the time of writing. From a regulatory perspective, Solaxy has the bones to thrive under scrutiny. Its focus on verifiable on-chain activity, auditable data structures, and smart contract transparency aligns neatly with what European policymakers are looking to reward. If European exchanges begin curating assets based on long-term viability and technical maturity, Solaxy is the kind of token that passes both tests. Its cross-chain capability means it is not confined to one camp. It pulls liquidity and users from multiple ecosystems, positioning it as a foundational layer rather than a single-use play. In a region that now favors structured expansion over speculative chaos, Solaxy offers exactly the kind of clarity that could bring long-term capital into its fold. SUBBD SUBBD is being built as a cultural creator-themed movement. As Europe's content economy explodes across platforms, creators are seeking more than just visibility. They are searching for sovereignty. SUBBD provides it in the most direct way possible; by turning audience support into tokenized income, without relying on a central platform to handle the flow. Unlike social apps that dictate payout cycles or censor content based on opaque policies, SUBBD allows creators to own their audience and monetize their output through a decentralized platform. For the EU, which is tightening its stance on platform accountability and creator rights, this is more than just a crypto use case. It is a digital policy solution waiting to be scaled. Its smart-contract framework allows for transparent payments, dynamic pricing models, and layered subscription tiers, all of which meet the growing demand for fair digital labor practices. The content economy in the EU is massive, but fragmented. SUBBD offers the infrastructure to unify that market across borders, backed by code instead of bureaucracy. The project’s potential was highlighted by popular crypto YouTuber ClayBro in one of his videos as well. With MiCA opening the gates for compliant innovation, platforms like SUBBD that focus on clear user identity verification, revenue tracking, and localized governance have a real opportunity to thrive. Whether it is used by influencers in Berlin or educators in Barcelona, the mechanics remain the same. A creator produces, while an audience pays. There is no platform gatekeeping and no surprise suspensions. Just direct digital ownership. In the post-MiCA Europe, SUBBD’s model may become the blueprint, not the exception. Best Wallet Token The importance of a reliable crypto wallet cannot be overstated, especially in a region like the EU where regulations are no longer speculative but active. Best Wallet Token is positioning itself not just as a tool for users, but as a central access point for an increasingly compliance-focused digital economy. In a landscape where every transaction may need to meet KYC, tax, and reporting standards, Best Wallet is not just relevant. It is necessary. Best Wallet is built for the modern crypto user. It integrates fiat onboarding, secure multi-asset storage, and cross-chain functionality, all in a format that feels intuitive even to those new to the space. This is crucial in the EU, where retail participation is high, but so are regulatory demands. Users want to engage, but they need platforms that can guarantee transparency, security, and support if things go wrong. Best Wallet delivers on all fronts. Its token is not a gimmick. It plays a central role in enabling in-app utilities, from transaction fee discounts to governance rights, and staking for advanced features. As more exchanges move into the EU, Best Wallet could become their preferred retail partner, offering an off-the-shelf custody solution that meets local requirements without sacrificing user experience. More importantly, it fits the EU’s new direction: accessible, compliant, and easy to scale. For investors looking at infrastructure plays instead of just narrative coins, Best Wallet Token represents the kind of utility-first product that could ride Europe’s crypto wave for years. Conclusion As the European Union transitions from skepticism to structured support, the playing field is changing fast. For investors, this marks a rare moment where macro-level policy shifts align with project-level readiness. The kinds of crypto assets that can thrive in this new environment are not just speculative plays. They are built for functionality, speed, compliance, and market fit. The tokens and platforms positioned to benefit most are those that understand what the next chapter of crypto adoption actually looks like. It will not be driven by hype cycles or social media noise. It will be driven by infrastructure, retail access, developer flexibility, and seamless integration into financial and digital ecosystems. Europe is finally ready for that shift, and the projects mentioned above represent some of the most compelling opportunities for those looking to take advantage of it. At press time its also rumored Donald Trump is in peace talks with Iran, mentioning ‘nothing is too late’ and that Iran has ‘reached out’ to him. If the Israel-Iran conflict does find a resolution soon, that would also switch the current bearish view among many crypto whales. One widely followed crypto influencer - ByzGeneral - tweeted today that prices would ‘full send’ if that breaking news is true.

2025-06-18T15:22:10,"The Critical Day Has Come: June FED Interest Rate Decision Expected Today in Bitcoin and Altcoins! Here Are the Expectations and Everything You Need to Know!","Bitcoin is negatively affected by the conflict between Israel and Iran, with the price moving in a narrow range. Investor unease has increased due to the uncertainty created by the tension between the two countries and the increasing concerns that the US could be directly involved in possible attacks by Israel against Iran. At this point, attention today turned to the FED decision, an important macro event that could determine the short-term direction of Bitcoin. After January, when the FED kept interest rates constant, dollar, gold, stock market and cryptocurrency investors are wondering when the first interest rate cut of 2025 will be made. When Will the June FED Interest Rate Decision Be Announced? The FED will announce its June interest rate decision on May 18, 2025 at 21:00 Turkish time. Following the decision, FED Chairman Jerome Powell will make oral statements at 21:30. What Will the FED's Decision Be? Despite inflation in the US falling to 2.4 percent and President Donald Trump's calls for drastic interest rate cuts, the Fed is not expected to make any changes to interest rates. While the overwhelming majority of the market, 99.9%, expects the FED to keep the policy rate constant between 4.25% and 4.50%, only a small portion, 0.1%, expects interest rates to be reduced to 4.00% and 4.25%. In general, experts expect the Fed to remain cautious despite the decline in inflation, amid ongoing uncertainty over tariffs and tensions in the Middle East. Atlanta FED President Raphael Bostic, drawing attention to the uncertainties in the economic outlook, said that they need a period of 3 to 6 months to make a more accurate assessment. BoF Does Not Expect a Cut from FED! Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave said the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged in June and will not make any cuts this year. However, the analyst added that they left the door open to a decision to cut only one rate in 2025. “The Fed's main message at its June meeting will be that it remains comfortably committed to a wait-and-see mode. Ongoing uncertainties are preventing interest rate cuts. “Investors should focus on Powell's assessment of softening labor data, recent benign inflation data, and persistent inflation risks from tariffs.” In light of all these statements and according to current pricing in money markets, the FED is expected to make its first interest rate cut in September 2025. A total of 2 interest rate cuts are expected by the end of the year. Powell Statements Are Very Important! While it is unlikely that the FED will make a surprise rate cut as expected, signals from the policy text and Powell's statements are expected to have an impact on the direction of the markets. At this point, Powell's stance on inflation, growth and interest rate cuts will guide the Bitcoin and crypto markets. Experts say Powell is cornered and that Powell and the FED have a difficult choice to make. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-18T14:55:48,"Trump’s Truth Social Eyes SEC Nod for BTC-ETH ETF Launch","Donald Trump's Truth Social website has once again made headlines, this time filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list a first-ever dual Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF). The new fund, supported by Yorkville America Digital, aims to give investors exposure to BTC and ETH in a single regulated product—a daring move that comes just months before the 2025 presidential election and when crypto policy just so happens to be a hot campaign issue. In the Dual-Asset ETF Structure Unlike the single-asset ETFs that have dominated U.S. markets since 2024, the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF would allocate 75% of its investments to Bitcoin and 25% to Ether, according to the S-1 filing. The fund's shares would be directly supported by BTC and ETH held in custody with Foris DAX Trust Company, doing business as Crypto.com. This product aims to simplify access for traditional investors, allowing them to diversify between the two largest cryptocurrencies without having to handle individual products or wallets. The ETF will trade on NYSE Arca, though the final ticker and cash custodian details are not yet known. Truth Social's filing also indicates that it plans to file further amendments, including a summary of its agency agreement with Crypto.com, which will also be providing trading execution, staking, and liquidity services for the fund. Election-Year Tailwinds and Political Calculus The timing of the filing is not coincidental. Trump Media's ETF attempt follows the SEC's approval of a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury plan for the firm, and as Trump himself has focused crypto in his campaign messaging. By leveraging the Truth Social brand and user base, the ETF could potentially attract a politically engaged retail group and help to further establish Trump as a crypto-friendly candidate. Analysts add that the ETF's launch could serve as a rallying point for crypto-friendly voters, especially with the Biden administration coming under criticism for regulatory uncertainty in the space. The move also comes as other issuers, including BlackRock and Fidelity, still dominate the single-asset ETF space, with Truth Social's dual-asset approach being a differentiation. How It Compares to Single-Asset Funds Most U.S. crypto ETFs are focused exclusively on Bitcoin or, more recently, Ethereum. Truth Social's product is unique in that it offers both assets under the same roof, which could appeal to investors seeking diversification without the burden of holding multiple funds. While the SEC has already approved several dual-asset ETFs, like the Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index US ETF, none have been paired with a high-profile political brand or social media site. The twin structure would also have a tendency to smooth out volatility as Bitcoin and Ether move in tandem but can decouple during periods of market stress or protocol upgrades. The fund's direct custody model, with Crypto.com as the trusted provider, is designed to provide assurance to investors of asset security—an issue that has dogged some earlier ETF launches. Will the SEC Say Yes? Legal professionals state that the chances of approval are higher than they would've been a year ago, due to the SEC's recent approvals of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Nevertheless, the Truth Social ETF's prominent political affiliations and twin-asset structure may attract additional attention. Some analysts caution that possible conflicts of interest—due to Trump's ownership in both the media firm and the ETF sponsor—may be a point of contention during the SEC's review process. However, the regulatory winds appear to be shifting. The SEC has been willing to approve new crypto products, provided they have robust transparency and surveillance mechanisms in place. The involvement of well-established partners like Yorkville America Digital and Crypto.com could also serve to reinforce the ETF's bid. “Given the SEC’s recent approvals, a dual Bitcoin-Ether ETF now has a real shot—especially in an election year where crypto is front and center,” — ETF legal analyst, June 2025 What's Next for Truth Social's ETF Bid? With the S-1 filed and the NYSE Arca listing application pending, the SEC's court now has the ball. Barring approval, the Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF could launch as soon as Q4 2025 into a growing crypto investment product market. Meanwhile, both investors and political pundits will be monitoring the SEC's next step—and the potential ripple effects on both the crypto markets and the campaign trail. The Bottom Line Truth Social's double bid for Bitcoin and Ether ETFs is a gamble that combines political branding with financial innovation. With the SEC ruling, the outcome could set a precedent for both crypto regulation and the intersection of digital assets with U.S. politics.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9615/trump-s-truth-social-eyes-sec-nod-for-btc-eth-etf-launch,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Business",cryptocompare
2025-06-18T14:54:30,"Shanghai’s new e-CNY hub marks China’s subtle play for global monetary influence","Shanghai’s new e-CNY operations center is China’s answer to the stablecoin-led disruption of cross-border finance, signaling that the digital yuan isn’t just for domestic trials anymore, but for an open audition on the global economic stage. On June 18, People’s Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng took the stage at Shanghai’s Lujiazui Forum to unveil what may become the digital yuan’s most consequential maneuver yet. Among eight sweeping reforms, the establishment of an e-CNY international operations center stood out, designed to pilot blockchain-based trade finance tools and streamline cross-border settlements. Pan was deliberate in his speech . While acknowledging that stablecoins and CBDCs are “reshaping traditional payment infrastructure,” he positioned the digital yuan as something distinct: a state-backed alternative that leverages blockchain’s efficiency while rejecting its decentralization ethos. You might also like: GENIUS Act could bring trillions in institutional crypto capital: experts weigh in From domestic trials to global playbook The establishment of Shanghai’s international e-CNY hub is more than just a pilot program. It marks China recalibrating its digital currency strategy in the face of slowing domestic traction and a shifting global financial order. Despite four years of pilots across 29 cities, the digital yuan remains a niche product within China’s vast payment ecosystem. As of mid-2025, e-CNY transactions accounted for just 0.16% of China’s total payment volume, dwarfed by Alipay and WeChat Pay, which dominate daily commerce. Even state-backed incentives, like expiring cash airdrops to spur usage, have failed to shift consumer habits. Yet, Beijing isn’t retreating, it’s pivoting. China views CBDCs as a long-term infrastructure play, not a quick retail win. The Shanghai hub signals a shift in focus from convincing street vendors to accept e-CNY to rewriting the rules of cross-border trade finance. In his speech, Pan tied the digital yuan to a broader vision of monetary multipolarity, where no single currency dominates global trade and finance: “The development of the international monetary system towards multipolarity will help promote sovereign currency countries to strengthen policy constraints, enhance the resilience of the international monetary system, and more effectively maintain global economic and financial stability.” Pan said in a translated statement. The governor made clear this isn’t just about currency politics. He emphasized how emerging technologies enable faster payment settlements. By integrating smart contracts into cross-border transactions, China aims to harness blockchain’s speed while maintaining centralized oversight. This hybrid approach targets stablecoins’ core appeal, instant settlements, while rejecting what Pan described as their “insufficient regulatory oversight.” The gamble? That developing economies will trade crypto’s openness for China’s promise of dollar-free, real-time infrastructure.

2025-06-18T14:47:59,"Interview: XRP a great hedge and alternative to other top 10 digital assets, says 3iQ CEO Pascal St-Jean","XRP, the cryptocurrency associated with Ripple, is witnessing a sharp rally. Since January 2015, XRP’s price has surged from just $0.02 to over $2.19 — a staggering increase of more than 10,800%. The latest rally is being fuelled by a confluence of factors: rising optimism around a potential resolution to the ongoing SEC lawsuit, which saw Ripple’s fine cut from $125 million to $50 million in a proposed joint settlement motion; increased institutional interest; and the beginning of a wave of XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) launches. On Wednesday, prominent Canada-based alternative asset manager 3iQ launched its XRP ETF — trading under the tickers XRPQ and XRPQ.U — on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Ripple is an early investor in the fund. XRPQ is one of the first ETFs in North America to offer direct exposure to XRP, currently the third-largest digital asset by market capitalization. The move closely follows Purpose Investments’ debut of Canada’s first spot XRP ETF, highlighting growing demand for regulated XRP investment vehicles. “XRP has demonstrated significant growth potential over the past decade, and this groundbreaking strategy offers Canadian and qualified global investors a transparent, low-cost and tax-efficient way to securely access that opportunity. Ripple Labs’ investment support reflects our shared leadership in advancing the digital asset space,” Pascal St-Jean, President and CEO of 3iQ, said. Invezz spoke with St-Jean to learn more about 3iQ’s decision to include XRP in its offerings, key trends shaping the crypto market, the firm’s investment positioning, and his perspective on ETH’s institutional role. Excerpts: How XRP differs from BTC, ETH, and SOL and why it is a great hedge? Invezz: You have just launched the 3iQ XRP ETF, what led you to add this digital asset to your existing suite of ETFs that include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana? Retail demand remains high for XRP in our view. What’s fascinating about XRP and XRPL is that the launch, development, and marketing for the technology is very centralized – a stark contrast to BTC, ETH, SOL, and others through Ripple Labs and its foundation. This approach is so radically different than those seen in other decentralized protocols that we see some investors actually prefer there to be “faces to the name”, and the ability for the technology to market and develop the XRPL directly to institutions and governments. They have an ambitious goal to replace the SWIFT system, which is something compelling that may be made possible by a known, centralized business rather than a decentralized protocol. We see it as a great hedge and alternative to other digital assets in the Top 10 by market capitalization. Bitcoin’s dominant performance to lead to adoption of other digital assets Invezz: What are some of the trends in the crypto market that you are taking note of, and how is 3iQ positioning its investments? One of the most significant trends we’ve noted throughout this cycle is Bitcoin’s dominant performance. This dominance can largely be attributed to two key factors: the increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin and the rise of public Bitcoin treasury companies. These developments are incredibly positive for the entire digital asset space, as they lend considerable legitimacy and bring substantial capital into the ecosystem. We believe this institutional engagement with Bitcoin will naturally lead to a trickle-down effect into other high-quality digital assets. We are already seeing clear evidence of this, with more and more institutions actively seeking to educate themselves on Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) now that they have a foundational understanding and comfort level with Bitcoin. Beyond asset-specific trends, we are observing a crucial overarching development: regulatory clarity is rapidly becoming more aligned on a global scale. The proactive stance of the USA in fast-tracking crypto as a priority is having a ripple effect, with other significant economies, such as Japan, actively preparing to open up their markets to digital assets. This increasing regulatory certainty is vital for institutional participation and further legitimizes the industry. 3iQ is exceptionally well-positioned to navigate this evolving landscape, as we have established footprints in multiple jurisdictions, allowing us to adapt and grow as frameworks solidify worldwide. Hedge fund world in crypto seeing increasing migration of talent from TradFi Furthermore, a powerful trend we’ve been closely observing, and indeed acted upon, is the migration of top-tier talent from traditional finance (TradFi) into the crypto space, particularly within the hedge fund world. This inflow of experienced professionals brings invaluable expertise and a sophisticated understanding of market dynamics to digital asset investing. Recognizing this as a key accelerant for the industry, 3iQ was a pioneering firm in building a dedicated managed account platform, which we call QMAP. This platform was specifically designed to cater to the needs of these sophisticated investors and allows for flexible, institutionally-compliant access to digital asset strategies. These trends, encompassing institutional adoption, clearer regulation, and the influx of TradFi talent, are not just happening; they are accelerating. At 3iQ, our investment strategy is built on recognizing and capitalizing on these evolving market dynamics. For instance, we launched North America’s first publicly traded Bitcoin and Ether funds, and more recently, the 3iQ Solana Staking ETF (SOLQ). This focus on providing regulated, secure, and accessible investment vehicles for leading digital assets allows us to cater to the growing institutional appetite while offering opportunities for both capital appreciation and, in the case of staking-enabled products, yield generation. Stablecoins seen as portfolio components but regulation is key Invezz : Stablecoins are piquing institutional interest from JPMorgan to PayPal to Uber also looking to adopt it. Tokenised assets are seeing rise in interest too. How do you view their potential as portfolio components or competitors to your existing offerings? We certainly see them as portfolio components. Stablecoins are an excellent example of public blockchains in action. Centralized corporate issuers are now able to launch their own versions of a digital dollar, while keeping them fungible and interoperable with competitors. These issuers can choose to mobilize their equivalent USD holdings in securities like T-bills and retain or pass through these earnings. However, regulations are key here and we expect the GENIUS act in the US to accelerate this crypto use case, just like MiCA regulations are doing in the EU. 3iQ already incorporates stablecoins in a variety of business activities and within some of our fund operations. Why ETH is internet’s ‘trust machine’ and can be a good institutional asset Invezz : Ethereum’s post-merge narrative has shifted towards staking and programmability. What’s your view on ETH as an institutional asset post the merge? Ethereum is the internet’s trust machine. Including all its major tokens, layer 2 networks, stablecoins, and corporate economy systems. It’s by far the most adopted technology today. The total economic value being settled on Ethereum today rivals G20 countries, yet it remains fully decentralized and adopted by many in countries with opposing views. The network has never been hacked or sustained downtime, yet it has maintained credible neutrality in a world that has been surrounded by anything but. Ethereum’s current architecture allows for any entity to create its own systems, financial or not, which each require financial trust, assurance, and interoperability on the modern internet. Demand for ether (ETH) will come from increasing demand for Ethereum’s role in the modern internet. Programmability on Ethereum allows for corporate entities to develop their own circular, native internet economies and currencies, including stablecoins. Ultimately, we see ETH as an economic imperative for businesses wishing to excel in an environment where artificial intelligence hyper-financializes and dramatically shifts legacy trust systems (inc. government systems., legal systems, corporate systems, etc.). ETH could be a compelling institutional asset as its token distribution from an early inception in July 2015 and current adoption rate are favourable, while proposing solutions to long-term chain security, including quantum computing, and its network consensus health. If there’s anything closest to a digital nation state, then Ethereum is it, and 3iQ are huge believers in the technology. Cayman and Japan next in 3iQ’s expansion plan Invezz : You partnered with Monex group which is now your majority owner, and continue to increase your partnerships globally, such as with Criptonite Asset Management in Switzerland and AltNovel in the UAE. What are other international markets that you are eyeing? Our journey began in Canada, and we are truly grateful for the clients, relationships, and business that we have built out here. However, it is difficult to build a business that relies on a single regulatory body. Budgeting for new initiatives and forecasting future revenue is a near-impossible task. Expanding to other jurisdictions beyond Canada is both opportunistic and adds resilience and diversification. We have begun speaking with major institutions in these jurisdictions with real capital, waiting to allocate. The next frontier for 3iQ following Switzerland and the UAE will be Cayman and eventually Japan, leveraging off our parent company Monex who are one of Japan’s most respected financial services institutions. Asset managers playing an increasing role in staking; see it as a feature of institutional portfolios Invezz: You were early in launching staking within regulated fund structures. Do you see staking yields as a long-term feature of institutional portfolios? Yes. Asset managers play an increasing role in supporting the consensus and governance of blockchains, which is what staking implies. Staking is a duty involving running the blockchain software and voting and attesting to blockchains, and signalling support for network state changes. We are trusted by our clients to custody and hold crypto assets on a diverse range of networks. This, by nature, implies we are important users of the blockchain and therefore have a fiduciary responsibility to represent our clients in consensus matters. In terms of yields, asset managers have the opportunity to outperform competitors, so we believe there is a lot of opportunity to outperform others in a way that is more technology-related than purely financial. This is where deep crypto asset expertise plays a role. It is certainly a feature of institutional portfolios as managers are incentivized to outperform holding the raw asset in question. Regulations bringing clarity to digital assets; pensions also actively exploring the sector Invezz: What’s the biggest barrier today for institutions still hesitant about entering digital assets? Is it volatility, custody, compliance or something else? Until now, it has been a toxic cocktail of uncertainty around regulatory status, tax treatment, and lack of institutional custody solutions known to the institutional investors (i.e. Northern Trust, BONY, State Street). In addition, consultants have been reluctant to embrace the asset class for various reasons. In the last 6 months, there has been a noticeable shift with regulators bringing more clarity to the digital asset space, more robust custody and risk-managed solutions becoming available, with talented, experienced hedge fund managers applying more traditional trading and market-neutral strategies to this rapidly maturing asset class. At the same time, we have recently witnessed Pensions becoming more proactive in their approach to education and exploration of the sector.

Table of Contents Retail vs. institutional: Diverging strategies Neo Pepe sparks retail excitement with strategic presale momentum Crypto craze unmasks Neo Pepe: An honest take to heed Neo Pepe’s path to rapid returns Ready to escape memetrix’s hold? Some leading market analysts forecast Bitcoin soaring to an impressive $600,000 by October 2025, emphasizing robust long-term institutional confidence. Veteran Wall Street analyst Fred Krueger highlights significant bullish indicators, including the U.S. government’s proposed Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and steadily increasing institutional adoption. Furthermore, Larry Fink, CEO of global investment giant BlackRock, has made even more ambitious forecasts, suggesting Bitcoin could reach valuations as high as $700,000, particularly due to potential sovereign wealth fund allocations ranging from 2–5% into cryptocurrencies. Analysts from well-respected institutions like Unchained and Binance concur, projecting valuations between $250,000 and $600,000 within the same timeframe, underlining Bitcoin’s growing role as a digital store of value and economic hedge. Yet, while Bitcoin ’s institutional future appears promising, retail investors have been actively seeking alternative cryptocurrency projects that offer immediate and substantial returns.

2025-06-18T14:43:09,"Trump's Tariff Resist Has Brought Results! Chinese Mining Equipment Manufacturers Have Started Moving Their Production Facilities to the US! Here Are the Detail...","The world's three largest manufacturers of Bitcoin mining devices, Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT, have begun setting up production facilities in the United States. Chinese Bitcoin Mining Giants Begin Production in the US: Strategic Move Against Tax Walls This move stands out as a defensive strategy against the high tariffs imposed on China by former US President Donald Trump as part of the trade war. The three companies together produce more than 90% of global bitcoin mining equipment. While moving to the U.S. could shield them from additional tariffs, it could also trigger U.S. security concerns over China over issues such as chip production and energy security. Bitmain began production in the US in December, a month after Trump’s election victory, while Canaan announced that it had begun trial production in the US, taking the step following Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs announced on April 2. MicroBT said in a statement that it was “actively implementing its localization strategy” in the US and aimed to avoid the impact of tariffs. Describing these developments as “not a superficial but a structural supply chain transformation,” Conflux Network CTO Guang Yang said that U.S. companies have adopted this move as a strategy not only to avoid tariffs but also to “move toward politically acceptable hardware sources.” While more than 30% of global Bitcoin mining is done in North America, more than 90% of the hardware still comes from China. That imbalance has particularly spurred action from firms such as U.S. rival Auradine, whose chief strategy officer, Sanjay Gupta, has argued that having hundreds of thousands of Chinese-made mining rigs connected to the U.S. power grid poses a national security risk. Even though China banned cryptocurrency activities in 2021, companies like Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT maintained their leadership in the industry thanks to their credentials as hardware manufacturers. Their first-mover advantage, especially in developing high-performance, mining-specific chips, put them ahead of Western competitors. Canaan moved its headquarters to Singapore and set up a trial production line in the US. The US market accounts for 40% of the company’s revenue. “Our goal is to reduce costs for both us and our customers,” said Vice President Leo Wang. Trump’s promise to be a “crypto president” and his son Eric Trump’s American Bitcoin initiative, which he founded with Hut 8, show that the US attaches strategic importance to bitcoin. But this interest also makes China’s dominance in infrastructure more visible. Major US-based mining companies MARA, Core Scientific, CleanSpark and Riot Platforms have highlighted the potential risks of over-reliance on Chinese hardware. Experts state that imports of Chinese-made devices will continue in the short term, but the US wants to transform the mining ecosystem by pushing for localization of these productions. “This is not an industry coup; it is the beginning of a long-overdue change,” says economist Ryan M. Yonk. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Trump's Tariff Resist Has Brought Results! Chinese Mining Equipment Manufacturers Have Started Moving Their Production Facilities to the US!

2025-06-18T14:41:55,"Spark crypto price crashes despite key metric hitting a record high","Spark token continued its freefall on Wednesday, June 18, a day after launching its highly anticipated airdrop. Spark ( SPK ) plunged to a low of $0.0470, down 30% from its highest point a day earlier. The decline came as its 24-hour trading volume surged 80% to over $378 million, significantly higher than its market capitalization of $83 million. Its fully diluted valuation also rose. The token crashed even as Spark’s ecosystem continued to show strength. According to DeFi Llama, the total value locked in its network jumped to a record high of over $6.66 billion, up from $6.48 billion in April. Spark provides on-chain capital allocation services, borrowing from Sky Protocol ( SKY ) and allocating that capital across decentralized finance, centralized finance, and real-world assets. It also allows users to deposit stablecoins to earn returns. According to its website , Spark’s savings TVL stands at $3.29 billion, with an average savings rate of 4.50%. The platform also enables users to borrow USDS and USDS+ against their liquid assets. You might also like: Spark price plunges 60% as sparkle fizzles out Why Spark crypto price crashed Spark token declined despite being listed on major crypto exchanges including Binance, Coinbase, Bybit, OKX, and Bitget. Some of these platforms are even offering incentives to attract investors. For example, OKX is offering a $100,000 reward to users who deposit USDC into the Spark USDC Savings Vault. The token’s drop is likely tied to the ongoing crypto market downturn, which has impacted Bitcoin ( BTC ) and most altcoins. Popular tokens like Virtuals Protocol, Dogwifhat, and Kaspa each plunged by over 10%. Another likely factor is the anticipated token unlocks. Spark launched with a circulating supply of 1.7 billion tokens, compared to a maximum supply of 10 billion, meaning 8.3 billion tokens are set to be released over the coming years, significantly increasing supply. It’s typical for newly listed tokens to decline initially, as airdrop recipients begin selling. For example, ZKsync ( ZK ) dropped over 30% in its early days before surging to a record high. Similarly, Berachain ( BERA ) fell by 43% before rebounding to a high of $9.18. This suggests Spark’s token may also recover in the coming weeks.

2025-06-18T14:40:36,"Nobitex Suffers Devastating $81.7 Million Crypto Hack","BitcoinWorld Nobitex Suffers Devastating $81.7 Million Crypto Hack The world of cryptocurrency often feels like the Wild West, full of innovation and opportunity, but also lurking dangers. Recently, the spotlight turned to Iran, where its largest crypto exchange, Nobitex , reportedly fell victim to a significant cyberattack. This incident has sent ripples through the local and international crypto community, highlighting the persistent security challenges faced by exchanges globally. Let’s dive into what happened during this crypto hack and what it means for users and the industry. What Happened During the Nobitex Crypto Hack? According to reports from blockchain security firm SlowMist, the Nobitex platform experienced a security breach. The attack specifically targeted the exchange’s hot wallets – the online wallets used for processing faster transactions – and also managed to compromise parts of its internal infrastructure. This combination suggests a sophisticated attack vector, potentially allowing attackers access to sensitive systems beyond just the immediate crypto funds. Initial estimations of the losses were significant. On-chain analyst ZachXBT, known for tracking illicit crypto flows, put the estimated losses at a staggering $81.7 million hack . This figure represents a substantial amount, especially within the context of Iran’s economic landscape and its growing crypto adoption. The attack didn’t just affect one blockchain network. The estimated losses reportedly spanned multiple prominent networks: TRON (TRX) Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible networks (including Ethereum and potentially others) Bitcoin (BTC) network The involvement of multiple networks indicates the attackers were able to access various hot wallets holding different types of cryptocurrencies. Who Claimed Responsibility for the Breach? Adding another layer to this incident, a hacker group known as Gonjeshke Darande has reportedly claimed responsibility for the cyberattack on Nobitex . While the full details of the group’s motives or capabilities are still emerging, such claims often accompany high-profile breaches and can be politically or financially motivated. Why is a Hack on Iran’s Largest Crypto Exchange Significant? Nobitex holds a prominent position as the largest Iran crypto exchange . This means the breach doesn’t just affect the exchange itself but also a large number of Iranian users who rely on the platform for trading and storing their digital assets. The incident raises critical questions about the security standards of major exchanges, regardless of their geographical location. Centralized exchanges like Nobitex are often prime targets for hackers due to the large volume of assets they hold in hot wallets to facilitate quick trades. While hot wallets are convenient, they are inherently more vulnerable than cold storage (offline wallets) because they are connected to the internet. What Can We Learn from This $81.7 Million Hack? Every security incident, unfortunately, provides valuable lessons. The $81.7 million hack on Nobitex underscores several key points for both exchanges and individual crypto users: For Exchanges: Enhanced Hot Wallet Security: Exchanges must implement multi-layered security protocols for hot wallets, including multi-signature requirements, strict access controls, and continuous monitoring. Robust Internal Infrastructure Security: Compromise of internal systems can be as damaging as wallet breaches. Regular security audits, penetration testing, and employee training against phishing and social engineering are crucial. Faster Incident Response: Having a clear plan for detecting, responding to, and mitigating breaches can limit losses and build user trust. Transparent Communication: While sensitive, timely and transparent communication with users about the incident is vital for managing panic and providing guidance. For Users: Diversify Storage: Do not keep all your funds on an exchange, especially large amounts. Utilize cold storage solutions like hardware wallets for long-term holding. Enable All Security Features: Use two-factor authentication (2FA), withdrawal whitelisting, and strong, unique passwords on all exchange accounts. Be Wary of Phishing: Attackers often target users directly to gain access to accounts. Be cautious of suspicious emails or messages. Stay Informed: Pay attention to security announcements from the exchanges you use. Is Your Crypto Safe on an Iran Crypto Exchange? This incident naturally leads users, particularly those in Iran, to question the safety of their funds on domestic platforms. While Nobitex is a major player, this hack highlights that no exchange is entirely immune to sophisticated attacks. The key is not necessarily the location but the security measures implemented by the exchange and the personal security practices of the user. The involvement of networks like TRON, EVM, and Bitcoin in the losses shows the broad impact of the breach across different asset types held on the exchange. The investigation into how Gonjeshke Darande allegedly carried out the attack will be critical in understanding the specific vulnerabilities exploited. Looking Ahead: The Future of Security After the $81.7 Million Hack The crypto industry is constantly evolving, and unfortunately, so are the methods of cybercriminals. The $81.7 million hack on Nobitex serves as a stark reminder that security must be the top priority for all participants. For exchanges, this means continuous investment in cybersecurity infrastructure, talent, and protocols. For users, it means taking personal responsibility for securing their digital assets and being aware of the risks involved in using online platforms. While a hack of this magnitude is undoubtedly a setback for Nobitex and its users, it also provides a critical opportunity for the exchange and the broader Iranian crypto market to learn and strengthen their defenses against future threats. The focus will now be on Nobitex’s response, recovery efforts, and how they plan to prevent similar incidents from occurring. The incident also puts a spotlight on the activities of groups like Gonjeshke Darande and the increasing sophistication of cyberattacks targeting the crypto space globally. Conclusion: Vigilance is Key The reported $81.7 million hack on Nobitex , Iran’s largest Iran crypto exchange , is a significant event that underscores the persistent security challenges in the cryptocurrency world. Affecting multiple networks including TRON, EVM, and Bitcoin, and allegedly claimed by Gonjeshke Darande , the breach highlights the vulnerabilities associated with hot wallets and internal systems. This incident serves as a crucial case study, reinforcing the need for exchanges to prioritize robust security measures and for users to adopt best practices for protecting their digital assets. While the path to full recovery and enhanced security may be challenging, the lessons learned from this substantial crypto hack are invaluable for the future resilience of the crypto ecosystem.

2025-06-18T14:38:32,"Why are Bitcoin and crypto prices down today?","Geopolitical risks and macroeconomic uncertainty are creating a risk-averse environment, and Bitcoin and crypto could slide further. Crypto markets have been under pressure over the past week, mainly due to global instability. On Wednesday, June 18, the overall crypto market dropped 1.06% to $3.25 trillion, with Bitcoin (BTC) falling to a daily low of $103,396, down 5% over the last seven days. Altcoins led the decline, with Ethereum ( ETH) reaching a daily low of $2,456 and posting a 10% drop over the same period. Escalating geopolitical tensions, along with concerns over macroeconomic policy, are weighing heavily on risk assets. You might also like: Corporations continue to spawn Bitcoin treasuries— What’s good about them? Over the past few days, crypto prices have largely reacted to Israel’s war with Iran, with signs of escalation fueling further declines. As of June 18, there were still no indications that the conflict could be resolved quickly. Also, signs of further escalation emerged as President Donald Trump refused to rule out direct military involvement. Meanwhile, investors are closely watching the Federal Reserve’s upcoming decision on interest rates, also set for June 18. According to Arthur Aziziov, Founder and Investor at B2 Ventures, this decision could offer some much-needed positive news for Bitcoin. You might also like: Bitcoin price primed for recovery, unless geopolitical tensions get worse: Bitfinex If Bitcoin drops, crypto markets will be hit hard Aziziov notes that there have been very few positive developments globally. This has weighed on sentiment and risks pushing Bitcoin even lower, likely triggering a broader decline across stablecoins. “If no positive sentiment emerges in the near future, Bitcoin could very well retreat into the $90,000-$84,000 range. On the other hand, if a positive backdrop does appear — particularly if the Fed signals a rate cut — then Bitcoin is likely to reach $128,000 by the end of the year,” Arthur Aziziov, B2 Ventures. Key levels to watch, according to Aziziov, are $112,000 and $100,500, currently the most important resistance and support levels. Any move beyond these will likely trigger either a major rally or a collapse. Indeed, as noted in this crypto.news analysis , there is a likelihood that Bitcoin could fall below $100,000.

2025-06-18T14:30:34,"Spain’s BBVA Advises Wealthy Clients to Invest 3–7% in Crypto","Spain’s second-largest bank, BBVA (Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria), is encouraging its high-net-worth clients to consider allocating a portion of their investment portfolio to cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC). According to a Reuters report published Tuesday, the bank now advises clients to invest between 3% and 7% of their portfolio in crypto, depending on their risk appetite. Philippe Meyer, head of digital and blockchain solutions at BBVA Switzerland, said at a conference in London that the bank began recommending Bitcoin to private banking clients as early as September 2023. “If you look at a balanced portfolio, if you introduce 3%, you already boost the performance,” Meyer explained. “At 3%, you are not taking a huge risk.” He also noted that clients have responded positively, challenging the narrative that crypto is too risky for traditional investors. BBVA’s advice contrasts with the broader stance of European regulators, who remain cautious about crypto. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) recently noted that 95% of banks in the EU continue to avoid any crypto involvement, citing regulatory and volatility concerns. BBVA Secures Regulatory Approval to Offer Crypto Trading in Spain BBVA has been offering crypto trading services since 2021 and moved toward active advisory in late 2024, setting it apart from other traditional banking institutions. In March this year, Spain’s securities regulator authorized BBVA to offer trading services for both Bitcoin and Ether to clients in the country. Initially launched for select private banking customers, BBVA’s crypto services will soon be integrated into its mobile application, allowing users to buy, sell, and manage digital assets seamlessly. The expansion marks a notable shift in the bank’s strategy as it embraces digital finance more aggressively. Traditional Banks Slowly Warming to Crypto BBVA’s growing involvement in crypto aligns with the broader regulatory changes brought on by the European Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) . Now fully implemented, MiCA provides a unified legal framework for digital assets in the EU. Crypto companies have until July 2026 to comply fully with its standards under an 18-month transition period. While most banks remain hesitant, some are beginning to follow BBVA’s lead. Santander, another major Spanish bank, is exploring the launch of its own stablecoin and expanding crypto services to retail clients. According to a May report, the bank is considering issuing both dollar- and euro-backed tokens as it navigates the emerging digital finance space.

2025-06-18T14:30:33,"US Dollar Critical Slips Ahead of Fed Decisions","BitcoinWorld US Dollar Critical Slips Ahead of Fed Decisions For those navigating the volatile world of digital assets, keeping an eye on traditional financial markets is crucial. The recent dip in the US Dollar on the Forex Market is one such signal, occurring just before potentially significant announcements from the Federal Reserve . This movement, coupled with fresh data showing cooling UK Inflation , paints a complex picture for global markets and has implications that even crypto enthusiasts should consider. Why is the US Dollar Under Pressure Right Now? The US Dollar , often seen as a safe-haven currency, has shown signs of weakening recently. This softness isn’t happening in a vacuum. It’s largely driven by market anticipation surrounding upcoming decisions from the Federal Reserve . Traders are positioning themselves based on expectations about the future path of Interest Rates . When expectations lean towards rates holding steady or even potentially decreasing in the future, the appeal of holding dollar-denominated assets offering high returns diminishes, putting downward pressure on the currency. Other factors contributing to the dollar’s current stance include: Shifting global economic sentiment. Comparative strength or weakness of other major currencies in the Forex Market . Technical trading patterns and market liquidity conditions. This dynamic is a classic example of how forward-looking markets react to expected central bank actions, influencing the value of major currencies. What’s on the Horizon for the Federal Reserve and Interest Rates ? The spotlight is firmly on the Federal Reserve as it prepares for its next policy meeting. The primary tool the Fed uses to influence the economy is adjusting the benchmark Interest Rates . For over a year, the focus has been on raising rates to combat inflation. However, with inflation showing signs of easing (though still above the Fed’s target), the debate has shifted. Market participants are closely watching for two key things from the Fed: The Rate Decision: Will they hold rates steady again, or is there any chance of a surprise move? The overwhelming expectation is for rates to remain unchanged at this meeting. Forward Guidance: This is arguably more important. What language does the Fed use regarding future rate hikes? Do they signal that the hiking cycle is definitively over, or do they keep the door open for further increases if inflation proves stubborn? Any hint about the future direction of Interest Rates can significantly impact the US Dollar , bond yields, and broader market sentiment, including potentially risk assets like cryptocurrencies. How Does Cooling UK Inflation Fit into the Global Picture? Across the Atlantic, the United Kingdom recently released inflation data that showed a notable cooling. This is a significant development because central banks globally have been battling high inflation, much like the Federal Reserve . Lower inflation numbers provide central banks, such as the Bank of England, more flexibility regarding their own Interest Rates policy. Key takeaways from the UK Inflation data: Headline inflation decreased more than expected. This reduces the pressure on the Bank of England to continue aggressively hiking rates. It contributes to a global narrative that inflationary pressures might be easing across developed economies. While seemingly separate, developments in major economies like the UK can influence global capital flows and sentiment, indirectly impacting the Forex Market and potentially contributing to the broader environment where the US Dollar is currently trading. The Interplay: Forex Market , Macro Data, and Asset Classes The connection between the US Dollar ‘s performance, the Federal Reserve ‘s stance on Interest Rates , and international economic data like UK Inflation is fundamental to understanding the Forex Market . Currency values reflect the economic health and monetary policy expectations of a country relative to others. Here’s a simplified view of the connections: Factor Impact on US Dollar (Likely) Broader Market Impact (Potential) Fed holds rates, signals end of hikes Negative (Lower future returns) Positive for risk assets (lower borrowing costs) Fed holds rates, remains hawkish Mixed (Rates high now, but future uncertain) Mixed to Negative (Uncertainty persists) Cooling UK Inflation Indirectly positive (suggests global trend, less pressure on other central banks to hike aggressively vs Fed) Positive for global sentiment (inflation easing) Understanding these relationships provides context for why the US Dollar ‘s movements are watched so closely by participants in all financial markets, not just currency traders. Actionable Insights for the Crypto-Curious How do these seemingly distant macroeconomic events relate to the world of Bitcoin and altcoins? Cryptocurrencies, while a distinct asset class, do not exist in a vacuum. They are influenced by global liquidity, risk sentiment, and the strength of traditional financial systems. Here’s what to consider: Dollar Strength vs. Risk Assets: Historically, a weaker US Dollar has sometimes correlated with stronger performance in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. When the dollar is strong, global capital tends to flow into dollar-denominated assets; when it weakens, that capital might seek opportunities elsewhere. Interest Rates and Liquidity: The Federal Reserve ‘s decisions on Interest Rates directly impact the cost of borrowing and the overall liquidity in the financial system. Lower rates generally mean more liquidity, which can flow into speculative assets like crypto. Higher rates tighten liquidity, potentially making riskier investments less attractive. Inflation Narrative: While UK Inflation is specific to Britain, the broader trend of inflation potentially cooling globally could influence central bank behavior everywhere. If inflation is truly under control, central banks might become less aggressive, which could be seen as a positive backdrop for asset markets. While there’s no one-to-one correlation, being aware of these macro forces helps in understanding potential market headwinds or tailwinds. It’s about recognizing that the health and direction of the traditional financial system, heavily influenced by the Federal Reserve and global economic data like UK Inflation , inevitably cast a shadow on newer markets like crypto. Navigating the Uncertainty Ahead The current environment is marked by anticipation. The US Dollar is reacting to expected policy, the Federal Reserve is at a critical juncture regarding Interest Rates , and international data like UK Inflation adds layers to the global economic puzzle. For anyone involved in financial markets, including the Forex Market and cryptocurrencies, staying informed about these developments is not just recommended, it’s essential. The outcome of the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, in particular, will provide significant clarity on the likely path of Interest Rates and could set the tone for the US Dollar and global markets for the coming months. Paying attention to the details – the rate decision itself and, crucially, the language used in the official statements and press conferences – will be key. Understanding these macro signals doesn’t provide guaranteed trading signals for crypto, but it offers valuable context for the broader market environment in which digital assets operate. It helps investors appreciate the larger forces at play that can influence everything from institutional sentiment to overall market liquidity. Summary: Key Takeaways To wrap up, here are the core points from the current market situation: The US Dollar has weakened, largely in anticipation of the Federal Reserve ‘s upcoming decisions. The Fed’s stance on Interest Rates is the central focus, with markets expecting a hold but scrutinizing guidance on future policy. Cooling UK Inflation adds to the narrative of easing global inflationary pressures, potentially giving central banks more room. These factors are driving movements in the Forex Market and have indirect but significant implications for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, by influencing liquidity and sentiment. Staying informed on these macro developments is crucial for understanding the broader financial landscape impacting all asset classes. The coming days, particularly around the Federal Reserve announcement, are poised to provide more clarity, but the interplay between major currencies, central bank policy, and global economic data will continue to be a dominant theme in the markets.

2025-06-18T14:30:12,"Crypto Gets A Green Light From Spanish Banking Giant","Since late 2024, BBVA’s private‑banking arm in Switzerland has been quietly advising clients to add Bitcoin and Ether to their holdings. According to Philippe Meyer, who leads digital and blockchain solutions at BBVA Switzerland, wealthy customers should allocate between 3% and 7% of their portfolios to crypto. Based on reports, this advice aims to boost returns without exposing investors to outsized risk. Related Reading: Tether Enforces Freeze On $12 Million In Tron Funds Over Illicit Activity Early Adoption Timeline BBVA began executing crypto trades in 2021 for a handful of clients. By September 2024, Meyer says the bank had started formally recommending a 3% Bitcoin stake in balanced portfolios. Now, risk‑tolerant clients can move up to 7% into digital assets, reflecting BBVA’s growing confidence in crypto as a mainstream option. Philippe Meyer recently delivered a presentation at a blockchain conference in Lugano, Switzerland. Source: BBVA Switzerland. Client Reaction And Risk Views Many clients have responded well so far. Meyer notes that even a small 3% allocation “already boosts the performance” of a diversified portfolio and “you are not taking a huge risk” at that level. Short‑term swings still occur—crypto markets can drop 20% in a week—but private clients seem ready to ride those waves in pursuit of higher gains. According to Reuters, BBVA, Spain’s second-largest bank, has been advising its private banking clients since September 2024 to allocate 3% to 7% of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies based on their risk appetite. The guidance currently applies to Bitcoin and Ether, with plans… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 17, 2025 Regulatory And Market Context Europe’s Markets in Crypto‑Assets regulation (MiCA) took full effect at the end of December 2024. This rulebook governs token issuers and service providers across the EU. Yet the European Securities and Markets Authority reports that 95% of EU banks avoid crypto activities entirely. BBVA stands out: in March 2025, Spain’s securities regulator gave it formal approval to offer Bitcoin and Ether trading in the country. Related Reading: Record‑High Ethereum Open Interest Signals Institutional Confidence Next Steps For App And Investors BBVA plans to roll out buy, sell, and portfolio management features inside its existing mobile app over the coming months. The launch will begin with select clients before expanding more broadly. As rival banks like Santander explore their own stablecoins—pegged to dollars and euros—BBVA’s move could spur a wave of mainstream crypto services. For now, only high‑net‑worth clients hear this crypto advice. But if allocations deliver solid returns and BBVA weathers any market crashes, other banks may follow. That would give more investors the chance to include crypto alongside stocks, bonds, and real estate. The real test will come if Bitcoin or Ether plunge sharply. If BBVA’s cautious plan holds up under stress, it may reshape how mainstream finance treats digital assets.

2025-06-18T14:30:09,"$3,000,000,000,000 Bank Says It’s Being Attacked ‘All the Time’ by Hackers, With Cybersecurity Now Lender’s Biggest Expense","The British banking giant HSBC is being attacked “all the time” by cybercriminals, according to the firm’s chief executive. The $3 trillion bank’s CEO Ian Stuart spoke to United Kingdom lawmakers last month about the threat, according to a new report in The Guardian. “The amount of money [that] banks, all of us, will be spending on our systems is enormous today. And it has to be. We are being attacked all the time.” Stuart reportedly said cybersecurity is now HSBC’s biggest expense, with the bank spending hundreds of millions of pounds to prevent hacks. EY reports that banks are expecting to use 11% of their IT budgets on cybersecurity this year, according to the Guardian. It’s not just a UK problem: A 2024 study from consumer insights and analytics firm J.D. Power indicated 29% of US bank customers and 22% of credit card users – at banks like Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs – experienced fraudulent activity on their accounts in the past 12 months. As fraud cases increase, J.D. Power reported that protection from illegal activity was a “key component to overall customer satisfaction, brand loyalty and advocacy” for banks. The study says that only 46% of bank customers and 40% of credit card users say they’ve been asked to act on fraud prevention measures in the last 90 days.

2025-06-18T14:29:54,"Bitcoin Clinches Fifth Consecutive Net Institutional Inflow, Solana Fund Dips","Digital assets saw another week of massive inflows to institutional products on surging sentiments. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether led gains, taking seven-day investments to $785 million. Meanwhile, mid-week Solana (SOL) and multi-asset funds succumbed to bearish tensions. Overall, traders’ bullish outlook follows an uptick in stocks and crypto prices. Bitcoin Institutional Funds Records $557 Million Gains A new CoinShares Digital Asset Weekly Flows data highlights growing institutional demand in May. In the last seven days, crypto institutional funds attracted $785 million, marking the fifth consecutive week of inflows after a prolonged downturn sparked by United States trade tensions. New wins have taken total assets under management (AUM) to $172 billion, while yearly inflow exceeded $7.5 billion. This surge reclaims the $6 billion losses between February and March. Bitcoin led the pack with $557 million gains, although a slight drop from previous weeks. This is due to hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve. Institutional demand for Bitcoin is also heading to a bull point as the price moves near its all-time high. Whale purchases have intensified since the last dip, strengthening investors’ year-end outlook. Adding to the growing demand, Metaplanet and Strategy continue accumulation, with the latter purchasing an additional 7,290 BTC. As expected, short-Bitcoin products faced outflow totaling $5.8 million last week after relatively high bull volumes. The United States led geographical data, with Hong Kong tapping a new high since November. “ Investor sentiment remained divided across regions. The US, Germany, and Hong Kong recorded inflows of US$681m, US$86.3m, and US$24.2m, respectively, with Hong Kong marking its largest inflow since November 2024. In contrast, Sweden, Canada, and Brazil saw outflows of US$16.3m, US$13.5m, and US$3.9m, respectively.” Ethereum Bullish, Solana Loses Steam Altcoin traders were shrouded in mixed signals due to fears of a heated market. Ethereum products notched $204 million, taking monthly inflows to $242 million while year-to-date figures surged past $757 million. XRP, SUI, and ADA saw $4.9 million, $9.3 million, and $500k inflows, respectively. On the other hand, institutional favorite Solana fell to bearish pressure as whales dumped assets. Experts believe this follows the profit-taking effect, although current headwinds have decreased the SOL price by 4%. According to the data, Solana recorded $900,000 in exits despite the expected spot ETFs in the United States.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-clinches-fifth-consecutive-net-institutional-inflow-solana-fund-dips/,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|SOL|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

2025-06-18T14:25:05,"Hyperliquid whale Aguila Trades closes all BTC short positions after $15M loss","One of the closely watched whales on Hyperliquid, Aguila Trades, has closed all remaining short positions on BTC. The total loss exceeded $15M after a series of partial liquidations. One of the notable traders on Hyperliquid, known as Aguila Trades, has closed a 20X leverage short position on BTC. During the brief correction in the past days, the trader did not take profits. Now, they face a series of partial liquidations. The trading move by Aguila Trades was closely watched as whale positions on Hyperliquid could sway the direction of the BTC market. The ""Mysterious Whale"" @AguilaTrades has closed his $BTC (20x) long position, resulting in a total loss of $15.42M in 2 trades. https://t.co/KvY5js9vTV pic.twitter.com/YfQvf7I1uD — Onchain Lens (@OnchainLens) June 18, 2025 On-chain whales are under public microscope On-chain data shows the position was finally closed, but the attempt to short BTC led to losses of $15.24M . Hyperliquid leveraged trading remains highly risky, and some of the positions are seen as deliberate stunts. However, unlike James Wynn , Aguila Trades has not commented on the positions or plans for the future. The trader also has not tweeted since January, simply testing out the possibilities on Hyperliquid. The trader then switched to a small 20X leverage long position , with just 0.55 BTC and an unrealized loss of under $1,000. In the meantime, one of Wynn’s known addresses is only holding a minimal long BTC position, though there were claims of trading through new secret addresses. Currently, BTC trades around $104,081, showing uncertainty over the developments between Israel and Iran, while awaiting the Fed interest rate decision. BTC general open interest fell from $35B down to $32.7B as traders become more cautious. Leveraged positions are pressuring BTC in a tight range between $106,000 and $103,000, potentially leading to both short and long liquidations if the price is pushed to those levels. Hyperliquid trading slowed down in May Hyperliquid volumes seem to be slowing down, despite the efforts of high-profile whales. For the entire month of May, the DEX saw over $134B in total volumes, down from $248B during the peak activity in April. Hyperliquid activity remains high, but activity for the past month was notably lower, despite the presence of high-profile whales. | Source: Dune Analytics The DEX also still lags behind Binance’s spot volumes as a benchmark . Hyperliquid still produced near-record fees above $2.48M on a daily basis, staying strong in the top 10 apps based on economic activity. Total open interest is at over $7.91B, lower than the all-time peak, but showing signs of recovery. Over 50% of open positions are for BTC, with $1.5B for ETH and around $522M for SOL. Smaller meme tokens and the native HYPE token see around $1B in open interest, as the positions are more volatile. So far, few whales have held public positions on memes, instead preferring to post high-profile trades on BTC. The slower activity on the DEX also reflected on the native HYPE token. After a recent peak above $45, HYPE retreated to $38.21, reflecting the overall market uncertainty. Despite this, three whale addresses were noticed accumulating HYPE . One of the whales bought in the $38 range, the second one accumulated above $39 , and the last one continued to buy above $40. The token continues to share the profits of Hyperliquid while also awaiting a higher price range.

On that day, total crypto market capitalization peaked at $3.4 trillion. As of June 18, it stands at $3.24 trillion, according to data from CoinMarketCap , marking a sharp retreat that reflects growing investor anxiety around geopolitical uncertainty. crypto market cap since June 12. Source: CoinMarketCap Volume has also pulled back, falling to $117.71 billion, down from $125.18 billion recorded at the peak of the rally last Wednesday. While crypto is often described as a hedge against macro risk, recent history shows that when true global tensions escalate, even Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) are not immune from the initial flight to safety. Broader crypto market dynamics The Israel–Iran conflict has had far-reaching effects across risk-on assets. Equities saw increased volatility last week, and oil briefly spiked before retreating on speculation that the conflict would remain regional. In crypto, however, the mood has decisively shifted from “buy the dip” to “wait and see.” Major altcoins including XRP, SOL, and ADA have posted high single-digit weekly losses, and even Bitcoin, still above $105,000, has struggled to regain upside momentum despite improving ETF flows.
