2025-06-17T21:30:52,"Bitcoin Holds Strong Despite Israel-Iran Tensions – Weekly Resistance Begins To Crack","Bitcoin has weathered a wave of volatility in recent days, triggered by the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. As geopolitical tensions rise and global markets grapple with uncertainty, risk assets like BTC have faced increased pressure. Yet despite this turbulent backdrop, Bitcoin has managed to maintain its footing above key support levels, demonstrating notable resilience. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidation Continues – Altseason May Follow A Clean Break Above Resistance Currently trading just under its all-time high, Bitcoin is in a consolidation phase that many analysts view as the calm before a potential breakout. Top analyst Rekt Capital shared insights indicating that the final major Weekly resistance, which has previously capped price rallies, may now be weakening as a point of rejection. If confirmed, this shift could signal a critical turning point in the market structure and open the door to price discovery. Investors are watching closely as BTC holds strong while macro headwinds—including rising US Treasury yields and fears of energy disruptions—continue to swirl. With the broader market bracing for further developments in the Middle East, Bitcoin’s ability to maintain higher lows and approach resistance with momentum suggests that the bulls may soon reclaim full control. The coming days could prove pivotal for the next phase of BTC’s market cycle. Bitcoin Awaits Clarity As Middle East Tensions Shape Market Sentiment The conflict between Israel and Iran continues to dominate headlines and exert influence over global markets. As tensions escalate, investors remain cautious, closely monitoring geopolitical developments and their macroeconomic ripple effects. In this uncertain environment, Bitcoin has entered a consolidation phase, with neither bulls nor bears fully in control. The lack of a clear direction stems from diverging investor expectations. Optimistic market participants anticipate that a diplomatic resolution may be reached in the coming days or weeks. A peace deal could reduce market anxiety, drive oil prices lower, and reignite momentum across risk assets—Bitcoin included. On the other hand, more cautious investors fear that the situation could worsen. Prolonged conflict may spark volatility in the energy sector, push inflation higher, and strain economic stability, particularly in regions dependent on oil imports. This week may prove decisive for Bitcoin’s next major move. Price action remains tightly bound, but all eyes are on the long-standing Weekly resistance. According to Rekt Capital, the final major Weekly resistance—once a strong rejection point—now appears to be weakening. This shift in structure suggests that Bitcoin may be preparing for a breakout into price discovery territory, should macro conditions stabilize. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Key Range Support – Bulls Set Sights on Higher Levels BTC Price Holds Above Key Support Amid Consolidation The 12-hour chart for Bitcoin shows that BTC continues to trade within a tight range, holding above the critical $103,600 support while struggling to break cleanly through the $109,300 resistance. This zone has repeatedly acted as a ceiling for price action since early May, with sellers stepping in around $109K and buyers defending dips near $104K. The recent bounce from just above the $103,600 level reflects ongoing buyer interest at that range, reinforced by the 100-day SMA (green), which is providing dynamic support. Meanwhile, the 50-day SMA (blue) is curling slightly upward, showing early signs of positive momentum, although the price has yet to clearly reclaim and hold above it. Volume remains moderate, indicating a lack of strong conviction on either side. For bulls to regain full control, BTC must push through the $109,300 resistance with sustained volume and hold that breakout level. A failure to do so may result in another rejection and a potential retest of the lower boundary near $103,600.

2025-06-17T21:30:47,"Gemini Takes Legal Action Against US CFTC: Details","Gemini, a leading cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., has filed a legal complaint against the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). According to a post on X , Gemini accuses the agency of running a seven-year campaign of “lawfare” instead of properly enforcing regulations. Gemini Claims CFTC Spent Years Making False Accusations In the filing, Gemini claims that the CFTC has spent years making false accusations against the crypto platform while ignoring real problems in the digital asset world. The complaint says the regulator used unreliable testimony from a former employee who is no longer credible and has not shown any proof of intentional wrongdoing after seven years of investigation. As U.S. lawmakers and agencies discuss the future of cryptocurrency rules, this lawsuit could influence how regulations are applied in the digital asset industry. The case highlights the frustration among crypto companies that want fair and consistent rules instead of what they see as harsh enforcement without proper procedure. Gemini’s Regulatory Hurdles: A Case of Misrepresentation? The controversy dates back to 2017 when the brainchild of the Winklevoss twins submitted proposals to the CFTC to launch futures contracts for Bitcoin (BTC). The CFTC alleged that the exchange misrepresented critical safeguards to prevent price manipulation. These safeguards were supposed to form the backbone of a trusted financial product, yet the regulator argued Gemini fell short of expectations. Fast-forward to January 2025. Weeks before a trial was set to unravel in Manhattan federal court, Gemini and the CFTC struck a deal. Gemini agreed to pay $5 million to settle the claims , neither admitting nor denying wrongdoing. This settlement underscores the legal tightrope walked by crypto firms aiming to push boundaries while facing increasing scrutiny. SEC Sues Gemini for Earn Program Recall that the Winklevoss brothers’ crypto exchange was under intense scrutiny a few years ago. The scrutiny concerned their Earn Program , which ordinarily allowed users to earn interest on their assets. All they had to do was lend the crypto assets to Genesis Global Capital, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG). However, the program turned negative when FTX imploded in 2022, and Gemini Earn users could not access their funds. It got worse when the US SEC sued both Gemini and Genesis, citing that Gemini Earn was an unregistered offering of securities. On the progress of the Earn Program, the exchange has paid out a $50 million settlement to compensate the investors.

2025-06-17T21:28:56,"Genius Group Expands Bitcoin Holdings by 52% Following Court-Ordered Resumption","AI-powered education group Genius Group has boosted its Bitcoin holdings by more than 50% in a renewed show of confidence in the digital asset. The company disclosed that it increased its corporate Bitcoin treasury from 66 BTC to 100 BTC, an addition of 34 BTC worth approximately $3.42 million, which brings the total value of its holdings to $10.06 million at an average purchase price of $100,600 per Bitcoin. Genius Group Ramps Up Bitcoin Treasury The move comes just weeks after a US Court of Appeals ruling on May 6 lifted restrictions that had temporarily blocked the firm from acquiring additional Bitcoin due to a legal dispute tied to its merger with FatBrain AI. The company resumed its BTC accumulation on May 22 with a $2.7 million investment, a move that signals a broader return to its Bitcoin Treasury Reserve Strategy. The Singapore-based firm has reaffirmed its long-term ambition to grow its holdings to 1,000 BTC, which aligns with a rising trend of institutional adoption amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. In an official statement , Genius Group CEO, Roger Hamilton, said, “We’re pleased to be able to have regained the right to manage our company’s capital in the way our Board and shareholders sees fit. Our 100 Bitcoin milestone is a significant step towards our 1,000 Bitcoin target.” Genius Group suffered a turbulent period earlier this year when it was legally forced to downsize its treasury amid ongoing litigation. In April, the company began liquidating part of its Bitcoin reserves after a US District Court order barred it from raising capital or investing in BTC. At the time, Hamilton criticized the court’s ruling as being rooted in false statements and financial coercion, and claimed the legal actions were orchestrated by individuals already facing fraud allegations. From Crisis to Comeback Data from Google Finance shows that Genius Group’s share price has fallen sharply in 2025, dropping by 68% from highs above $0.70 in early January to a low near $0.22 in April, which closely mirrored the timeline of the company’s legal challenges. However, the stock has shown signs of recovery in recent weeks, trading at $0.36 as of June 17. The modest rebound suggests renewed investor confidence following the May court ruling.

(NYSE: JPM) has unveiled its permissioned stablecoin on the Base network, a top-tier Ethereum (ETH)-based layer two scaling solution backed by Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN). The well-established bank, with around $4 trillion in assets under management (AUM), intends to offer stablecoins services to approved institutional clients. “Kinexys by JPMorgan is launching JPMD, a USD deposit token for institutional clients, on Base. It will be the first token of its kind on a public blockchain, enabling fast, secure, 24/7 money movement between trusted parties,” Base noted . JPMorgan Enters Stablecoins Market On Time After many years of criticizing Bitcoin and the digital asset market, JPMorgan has fully embraced the nascent technology to remain relevant in the future. On Tuesday, the U.S. Senate is expected to pass the GENIUS Act , which will regulate the stablecoins industry. According to Scott Bessent, the U.S. Treasury Secretary, the Stablecoins market could grow from its current $261 billion to about $3.7 trillion by the end of this decade. “A thriving stablecoin ecosystem will drive demand from the private sector for US Treasuries, which back stablecoins. This newfound demand could lower government borrowing costs and help rein in the national debt,” Bessent noted . Impact on Base Network The strategic launch of the JPMD by JPMorgan on the Base network will play a crucial role in increasing its on-chain activity. Already, the Base network is the current leader in Ethereum’s Layer Two (L2) chains, with about $3.7 billion in total value locked (TVL) and around $4.13 billion in stablecoins market cap.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/jpmorgan-unveils-its-u-s-dollar-backed-jpmd-on-stablecoin-ethereums-base/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION","News|Crypto news|Ethereum",cryptocompare

2025-06-17T20:45:03,"Tether Buys 32% of Gold Miner to Back ‘Bitcoin-Gold’ Reserve Strategy","This investment is a pivotal move in Tether’s strategy to anchor its ecosystem with tangible assets and precious metals, such as gold and Bitcoin, which will serve both as a financial hedge and a foundation for a more decentralized, resilient digital economy. Why Tether is Eyeing a Bitcoin–Gold Reserve Strategy Tether continues to make a bold move of expanding its reserves beyond traditional holdings. Earlier this month, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino revealed at the Bitcoin 2025 conference that Tether now holds over 100,000 BTC—valued at more than $10 billion—and 50+ tons of physical gold, worth roughly $6 billion. Therefore, Tether’s latest move of acquiring a 32% stake in Elemental Altus through its investment arm called Tether Investments amplifies its dual-pillar reserve strategy. Bitcoin offers decentralization, liquidity, and outsized upside, while gold brings centuries of demonstrated resilience, crisis‑proof value, and stability. Ardoino acknowledged, “Tether’s growing investments in gold and Bitcoin reflect our forward-looking strategy to build a more resilient and transparent financial system. Just as Bitcoin provides the ultimate decentralized hedge against monetary inflation, gold continues to be a time-tested store of value.” Why now? Ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and inflation have pushed many central banks to increase gold allocations. A World Gold Council survey shows 76% expect to raise gold reserves over five years, while nearly 75% plan to reduce dollar holdings; gold prices hit an all‑time high of $3,500/oz in April 2025. Against this backdrop, Tether’s move mirrors institutional trends, aligning stablecoin assets with macroeconomic conditions. By shifting a portion of reserves into BTC and gold, Tether diversifies its exposure, reducing reliance on yield-sensitive instruments. Holding physical gold and Bitcoin enhances the credibility of USDT, responding to longstanding transparency concerns and strengthening Tether’s position as a quasi‑institutional asset manager. Ardoino pointed out, “By gaining exposure to a diversified portfolio of gold royalties through Elemental, we are strengthening the backing of our ecosystem while advancing Tether Gold and future commodity-backed digital assets. This is not just about investment—it’s about building financial infrastructure for the next century.” Will Tether’s Elemental Altus Acquisition Spur a Wave of Commodity-Linked Stablecoins? Tether’s recent acquisition of Elemental Altus is a major strategic move that could accelerate the development of commodity‑linked stablecoins. By strategically accumulating commodity-linked reserves to support a broader suite of asset-backed stablecoins, Tether is deepening its footprint in real-asset tokenization. Through Elemental Altus, Tether seeks to gain exposure to royalties on gold, tungsten, lithium, and other minerals. In the process, this strategy has the potential of triggering a wave of new commodity-pegged coins. Therefore, Tether’s $82 million Elemental Altus acquisition signals more than a simple investment, it’s a prelude to a new era of commodity-backed stablecoins. By securing royalties on diverse natural resources like gold, tokenizing them via Hadron, and leveraging its established USDT infrastructure, Tether is uniquely positioned to lead the next wave of asset-referenced crypto assets. Ardoino stated, “We believe in financial systems that are backed by real assets, not just promises. Our investment in Elemental complements our long-standing belief that tangible assets like Bitcoin and gold will underpin the most durable forms of digital value.” Meanwhile, Tether is not only eyeing the Bitcoin-Gold strategy, but also the artificial intelligence route. For instance, Tether recently revealed plans to roll out a decentralized AI platform dubbed Tether AI because this cutting-edge technology is poised to transform virtually every aspect of both real and digital worlds. Conclusion Tether’s dual‑asset strategy is a calculated evolution. By combining the upside of digital assets with the reliability of gold, the firm seeks to reinforce stablecoin stability and appeal to a broader investor base. In doing so, Tether isn’t just issuing a token, it’s building a reserve-backed financial infrastructure that could trigger a wave of commodity-linked stablecoins.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9603/tether-buys-32-of-gold-miner-to-back-bitcoin-gold-reserve-strategy,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|USDT|XAUT","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Philippe Meyer, Head of Digital and Blockchain Solutions at BBVA Switzerland, announced this strategy at the DigiAssets conference in London. He noted that clients with higher risk appetites are being guided to invest up to 7% in digital assets. This move is notable as it reflects a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies within mainstream finance. While many banks have been cautious, BBVA has been facilitating crypto purchases for clients since 2021. Meyer believes BBVA is among the first major global banks to actively recommend cryptocurrency investments to its clients. Despite ongoing regulatory warnings about the risks associated with cryptocurrencies, BBVA maintains that a modest exposure—starting at 3%—can enhance portfolio performance without significant risk. The bank's current recommendations focus on Bitcoin and Ether, with plans to include other cryptocurrencies later this year. This development comes amid a resurgence in cryptocurrency markets, with Bitcoin reaching new highs in May.

No answers, just a more paranoid market left picking up the pieces. On June 16, without warning or explanation, the official X account for Pump.fun, the Solana-based memecoin launchpad, was abruptly taken offline. Shortly after, the personal handle of co-founder Alon Cohen (@a1lon9) also vanished. The unexpected purge didn’t stop there. Several other accounts tied to high-profile token platforms, including GMGN, Bloom Trading, and ElizaOS, were swept up in what appeared to many as a coordinated crackdown, raising more questions than answers. Was this X enforcing new policies? A shadowban by overzealous moderators? Or, more ominously, the first sign of regulatory pressure on Solana’s hyperactive memecoin ecosystem? Then, just as suddenly, the accounts were restored. X offered no justification for either decision, leaving traders to wonder whether the episode was a glitch, a warning, or pure bureaucratic randomness. You might also like: Why is Pi Network token down today? Keen users quickly noted Pump.fun’s unceremonious comeback on X and raised concerns about what might be happening behind the scenes. https://t.co/eZhMtacwIT is back and I'm left to wonder what's really going on in the crypto space are all the recent happenings mere coincidences or is there a back story somewhere? Well we keep our eyes primed for more updates, and hope to be on the winning team. https://t.co/pvjbEM7KM6 — Vindex Victor (@EjimV221) June 17, 2025 A billion-dollar memecoin moment under fire The social media blackout came just as Pump.fun was gearing up for a massive token offering, rumored to target a valuation near $1 billion. The reported plan drew both attention and backlash, as Pump.fun’s meteoric rise in 2024–25 made it a poster child for rapid-fire memecoin activity. Founded in January 2024 by Alon Cohen and his team, the platform has hosted more than six million token launches and generated over $350 million in annual revenue. But this growth hasn’t come without scrutiny. In November, Pump.fun was forced to disable its livestream feature after users exploited it to broadcast everything from violent threats to explicit content. That incident exposed the darker side of memecoin culture and how quickly unregulated platforms can spiral into chaos. Now, with its rumored $1 billion token sale drawing mainstream attention, regulators appear to be taking notice. While no agency has publicly claimed responsibility for the X suspensions, the U.S. SEC has been increasingly vocal about cracking down on what it sees as unregistered securities offerings, a category that could easily include memecoin launchpads. What makes this episode particularly troubling for crypto is how it exposes the industry’s dependence on platforms it doesn’t control. Pump.fun’s website continued operating during the suspension, but how long can any platform thrive when its primary marketing channel can vanish overnight? The takeaway is in black and white. In the crypto industry’s ongoing battle between innovation and regulation, social media platforms have become the new battleground. And as Pump.fun’s rollercoaster week shows, the rules of engagement are being written in real time, with billions of dollars hanging in the balance.

2025-06-17T20:10:32,"Brazil Explores Bold Bitcoin Reserve Strategy","BitcoinWorld Brazil Explores Bold Bitcoin Reserve Strategy Exciting developments are unfolding in Latin America! Brazil is taking a significant step towards potentially integrating Bitcoin into its national financial strategy. A bill proposing the allocation of a portion of the country’s foreign exchange reserves to Bitcoin has successfully navigated its initial legislative hurdle. This move, if fully enacted, could position Brazil as a major player in the sovereign adoption of digital assets. What is the Brazil Bitcoin Reserve Bill (RESBiT)? The core of this legislative push is Bill 4501/2023, known as the RESBiT initiative. This proposal outlines a plan to allocate up to 5% of Brazil’s foreign exchange reserves into Bitcoin. Foreign exchange reserves are assets held by a central bank or monetary authority, usually in foreign currencies like the US dollar, Euro, or Yen, along with gold and other financial instruments. They serve crucial purposes such as stabilizing the national currency, managing liquidity, and providing confidence in the country’s financial stability. The idea behind RESBiT is to diversify these reserves by including Bitcoin. The bill has recently passed its first committee stage, a critical step in the long legislative process. This initial success signals growing interest and potential acceptance within Brazilian political circles regarding the strategic role of Bitcoin. Why Would Brazil Consider Bitcoin Reserves? Allocating national reserves to a volatile asset like Bitcoin is a bold move. Several potential motivations could be driving this initiative: Diversification: Reducing reliance on traditional reserve assets and currencies. Inflation Hedge: Viewing Bitcoin as a potential store of value against inflation, similar to gold. Innovation and Technology Adoption: Signaling Brazil’s embrace of digital assets and blockchain technology. Attracting Investment: Potentially making Brazil a more attractive destination for cryptocurrency businesses and investors. Strategic Positioning: Following the lead of other nations or positioning Brazil as a leader in the digital asset space. The proposal suggests a maximum allocation of 5%, indicating a cautious approach rather than a full pivot. This percentage allows for exposure to Bitcoin’s potential upside while limiting the overall risk to the nation’s critical foreign exchange reserves. How Does This Compare to El Salvador’s Bitcoin Strategy? If Bill 4501/2023 becomes law, Brazil would become the second Latin American nation to formally adopt a Bitcoin reserve strategy at the sovereign level, following El Salvador. However, the approaches differ significantly. El Salvador: Made Bitcoin legal tender, acquired significant Bitcoin holdings directly using state funds, and built infrastructure like the Chivo wallet. Their strategy is more integrated into the national economy and aims for broader adoption. Brazil: The RESBiT bill focuses specifically on allocating a portion of existing foreign exchange reserves. It does not propose making Bitcoin legal tender or integrating it directly into daily transactions for citizens on the same scale as El Salvador. It’s primarily a reserve management strategy. Brazil’s potential move is less about making Bitcoin a currency for its citizens and more about treating it as a strategic asset within its national treasury management. This distinction is crucial when evaluating the potential impact and goals of the RESBiT initiative. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges of Bitcoin Reserves? Adding Bitcoin to national reserves comes with potential rewards and significant risks. Potential Benefits: Exposure to a high-growth asset class. Potential hedge against global economic instability or currency devaluation. Increased financial sovereignty by holding an asset not tied to any single government or central bank. Setting a precedent for other nations, potentially increasing Bitcoin’s global legitimacy. Potential Challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is known for dramatic swings, which could impact the value of reserves. Security: Ensuring the secure storage of private keys for national Bitcoin holdings is paramount and complex. Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory landscape for Bitcoin is still evolving. Public and Political Opposition: Skepticism about Bitcoin’s stability and utility could lead to significant internal debate. Liquidity: While Bitcoin is highly liquid, managing large national holdings during times of crisis could present unique challenges. The 5% allocation proposed in the RESBiT bill suggests an awareness of these challenges, aiming for a balance between potential upside and risk mitigation for Brazil’s financial stability. What Happens Next for the Bitcoin Bill in Brazil? Passing the first committee stage is a positive signal, but it is only one step in a multi-stage legislative journey in Brazil. The bill must proceed through other relevant committees, potentially undergo revisions, and ultimately face votes in both houses of the Brazilian National Congress before it can be signed into law by the President. The process can be lengthy and is subject to political dynamics and public opinion. Monitoring the progress of Bill 4501/2023 through the Brazilian legislature will be key for anyone interested in the intersection of national finance and digital assets. The debates and discussions surrounding this bill could also influence how other nations perceive and potentially approach their own Bitcoin reserves or digital asset strategies. Conclusion: Brazil’s Bold Step in the World of Bitcoin Reserves Brazil’s advancement of the RESBiT bill marks a significant moment in the global conversation around sovereign Bitcoin adoption. While distinct from El Salvador’s approach, the potential allocation of foreign exchange reserves to Bitcoin signals a growing recognition of digital assets at the highest levels of national finance. The journey for this bill is far from over, but its initial success highlights a willingness within Brazil to explore innovative strategies for managing national wealth in an increasingly digital world. The outcome of this legislative process could have ripple effects, encouraging further discussion and potential action from other countries considering the role of Bitcoin in their own reserve strategies.

2025-06-17T20:00:21,"VanEck Warns of Emerging Risk for Bitcoin Treasury Companies, Outlines Strategies To Combat Capital Erosion","An analyst from one of the biggest asset managers in crypto is warning Bitcoin treasury companies that they need to pay attention to the ratio of their shares compared to their BTC net asset values (NAV). Matthew Sigel, the head of digital assets research at VanEck, says that no public BTC treasury companies have traded below their Bitcoin NAVs for a sustained period. However, Sigel notes that one company, the US medical tech firm Semler Scientific, is approaching parity. “As some of these companies raise capital through large at-the-market (ATM) programs to buy BTC, a risk is emerging: if the stock trades at or near NAV, continued equity issuance can dilute rather than create value. That is not capital formation. It is erosion. Companies pursuing a Bitcoin treasury strategy should adopt safeguards now, while premiums still exist. Some ideas: Announce pause to ATM issuance if the stock trades below 0.95 times NAV for 10 or more trading days. Prioritize buybacks when BTC appreciates, but the equity fails to reflect that value. Launch a strategic review if NAV discount persists. That might include a merger, spinoff, or sunset of the BTC strategy.” Sigel also argues that executive compensation should align with NAV per share growth, not with total share count or size of the Bitcoin position. “We’ve seen this movie before with the miners: persistent issuance and outsized executive pay. No need for a sequel. Once you are trading at NAV, shareholder dilution is no longer strategic. It is extractive. Boards and shareholders should act with discipline now, while they still have the benefit of optionality.” Last week, top pseudonymous trader DonAlt warned that he thinks Bitcoin treasury companies will be the source of massive selling pressure in the next bear market. “Bitcoin treasury companies… will be the reason for the next bear market being as violent as prior bear markets, and no one can convince me otherwise. Good Ponzi while they’re going though so keep going.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-17T20:00:00,"Trump Talks Crypto at Coinbase Summit – Here’s Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Keeps Popping Up in DeFi Circles","President Trump recently released a 90-second video at the Coinbase Summit, during which he reiterated his administration’s commitment to end the war on crypto. He also discussed his crypto working group, designed to help guide policy on the crypto sector. Trump also mentioned legislation in Congress, where they are working with governors to pass the GENIUS Act that will support the creation of dollar-backed stablecoins. Additionally, he said they would seek to create simple market frameworks, allowing the US to dominate Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto. The appearance at the conference is the second time Trump has addressed the crypto sector since he took office. In March, he addressed a crypto summit in New York and attended the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville in person during the campaign. His addresses mark the first time a sitting US president has addressed the crypto sector, marking a major shift in policy at the federal level. As a result, with clear crypto market rules set to be adopted, it could take crypto to new heights. Amid this expected wave of capital that will flood the crypto sector, investors are looking for ways to grow their holdings to new heights. One of the most popular options being considered is presales. However, unlike past years, this time the focus is on utility, and not meme coins. A project that is popping up constantly in discussions is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is built to take decentralized finance (DeFi) to the next level. So far, analysts are quite upbeat about the project, forecasting massive gains when the MUTM tokens go live. A Deep Dive Into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project built for utility in the DeFi sector. It is designed as a decentralized non-custodial lending protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. When they join as lenders, they deposit the funds and begin to earn interest. The interest rate that they earn is based on the pool utilization rate. This rate is determined by measuring the assets in a communal pool being actively borrowed versus the total amount in that pool. Borrowers in the pools can choose between stable and variable rates. The stable rate is reserved for highly liquid tokens that have low volatility. When a borrower is granted a stable rate, it typically begins at a higher rate than the variable rate based on a time-weighted average. That accounts for the initial advantage that they get, and any changes in the future. If the variable rate gets much higher than the stable rate, it can be rebalanced to maintain fairness in the ecosystem and to protect protocol liquidity. Lenders get access to mtTokens when they deposit assets in a pool. For instance, if they deposit $1,400 worth of ADA in a pool, they receive mtADA tokens in return on a 1:1 ratio. These tokens are based on the ERC20 token standard and represent the value of the deposit, plus any accrued interest. The mtTokens make it easy for the holders to track the value of their assets in the pools on-chain. Additionally, it simplifies the process as users do not have to actively claim or compound their earnings in the pools over time. Details Of The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is currently in phase 5, and over $10.7 million worth of tokens have been sold so far. Tokens in the current phase are going for a 200% discount compared to the phase 1 price of $0.01. Despite this massive increase, over 38% of the tokens set aside for phase 5 have been sold, barely two weeks after they launched. The presale has seen passive participation numbers from investors seeking to benefit from the upcoming changes in crypto regulation. So far, around 12,100 unique buyers have secured their tokens. One of the main drivers of this growth is recent updates in the analysts’ forecasts. They now predict that MUTM tokens could rise by 2,550% once the tokens go live. Based on these forecasts, a $2,400 investment in the presale right now could grow into $61,200 when the tokens launch. One of the reasons why analysts are so optimistic about the presale is the planned beta version launch of the platform when it goes live. The beta version launch will occur on the token listing day, when the tokens are released for $0.06 each. That is expected to lead to a massive surge in the price of the tokens. However, if you wait until the token listing price, the return you could get will be half of what those who buy in the current phase can get. Bottom Line Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an exciting project in the presale phase that could deliver massive returns once it goes live. With an expected return of over 20x, it represents an opportunity to make up for any losses you may have suffered elsewhere in the crypto sector. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that you should not miss.

2025-06-17T19:50:36,"Bitcoin Strategy: Fold Secures Massive $250M Facility to Boost Corporate Bitcoin Holdings","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Strategy: Fold Secures Massive $250M Facility to Boost Corporate Bitcoin Holdings In a significant move signaling strong confidence in the digital asset space, Fold Holdings, the company behind the popular Fold App that rewards users in Bitcoin, has announced a substantial financial maneuver designed to bolster its corporate balance sheet with more of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This development underscores a growing trend among forward-thinking companies to integrate Bitcoin into their financial strategies. What Does This $250M Equity Facility Mean for Fold App? According to a press release via GlobeNewswire, Fold Holdings has entered into a $250 million equity purchase facility. This isn’t a direct cash injection upfront, but rather an agreement that allows Fold to sell up to $250 million worth of its equity (stock) to a specific investor over time, at Fold’s discretion. The key takeaway? Fold plans to use the vast majority of the proceeds generated from selling this equity primarily to acquire more Bitcoin for its corporate treasury . For users of the Fold App , which is known for offering Bitcoin rewards on everyday spending, this move signals a deepening commitment to the Bitcoin ecosystem. It positions Fold not just as a platform for earning Bitcoin, but as a company fundamentally aligned with Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Why Are Companies Building a Corporate Bitcoin Treasury? Fold isn’t the first company to strategically add Bitcoin to its balance sheet. MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, pioneered this approach, accumulating billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin. Other companies have followed suit, albeit on a smaller scale. The primary reasons companies opt for a corporate Bitcoin strategy often include: Hedge Against Inflation: Bitcoin’s fixed supply is seen by many as a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Store of Value: Bitcoin is viewed as a digital gold, offering a durable store of value outside traditional financial systems. Growth Potential: Companies anticipate potential significant appreciation in Bitcoin’s value over time, boosting their balance sheet. Innovation and Signaling: Holding Bitcoin can signal a company’s forward-thinking approach and embrace of digital innovation. Fold’s decision to use a significant equity facility specifically for this purpose highlights the strategic importance they place on accumulating this digital asset. Understanding the Equity Facility Mechanism An equity purchase facility, also known as a committed equity facility or standby equity distribution agreement (SEDA), is a funding arrangement where a company (Fold) has the right, but not the obligation, to sell shares to an investor (the facility provider) over a set period and up to a maximum amount ($250 million). Here’s a simplified breakdown: Fold needs capital, in this case, to buy Bitcoin . They decide to draw down on the facility, selling a certain number of shares to the investor. The investor buys the shares, providing cash to Fold. Fold uses this cash to purchase Bitcoin for its corporate treasury . This process can be repeated until the $250 million limit is reached or the agreement expires. This method provides Fold with flexible access to capital, allowing them to raise funds when market conditions are favorable for selling equity and, subsequently, for buying Bitcoin . Analyzing Fold’s Specific Bitcoin Strategy Fold’s Bitcoin strategy appears multifaceted. Firstly, it’s about strengthening the company’s balance sheet with what they believe is a appreciating asset. This aligns with the broader corporate Bitcoin trend. Secondly, it could be seen as a strategic alignment with their core business. A company focused on rewarding users in Bitcoin naturally enhances its brand and mission by holding a significant amount of Bitcoin itself. It builds trust and demonstrates a long-term belief in the asset they promote. Thirdly, utilizing an equity facility offers flexibility. Fold can time their equity sales and subsequent Bitcoin purchases based on market conditions, potentially allowing them to acquire Bitcoin at opportune moments. Placing Fold’s Move in the Context of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Fold’s significant funding round specifically aimed at increasing its Institutional Bitcoin holdings is a strong indicator of the continued maturation and adoption of Bitcoin by corporate entities. While not as large as MicroStrategy’s holdings, a $250 million facility dedicated primarily to Bitcoin acquisition is a substantial commitment for a company like Fold. This move contributes to the overall narrative of Institutional Bitcoin adoption, showing that it’s not just large, publicly traded companies considering this asset class, but also growth-stage companies within the crypto ecosystem itself. Key Considerations: Benefits and Challenges Like any strategic financial decision, building a Crypto Treasury with a volatile asset like Bitcoin comes with potential benefits and challenges: Benefits: Enhanced Balance Sheet: Potential for significant asset appreciation if Bitcoin’s value increases. Strategic Alignment: Reinforces Fold’s brand identity as a Bitcoin-centric company. Inflation Hedge: Provides potential protection against the declining purchasing power of fiat currency. Flexibility: The equity facility allows for opportunistic funding and purchasing. Challenges: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically, potentially leading to significant paper losses on the balance sheet. Market Timing Risk: Deciding when to draw on the facility and when to buy Bitcoin involves market timing risk. Execution Risk: Successfully executing the equity facility agreement requires navigating financial markets. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for corporate crypto holdings is still evolving. Actionable Insights for the Reader What can we learn from Fold’s strategic move? Corporate Confidence: This action signals continued confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition among companies operating within the space. Alternative Funding: It demonstrates how companies are using innovative financial structures like equity facilities to fund strategic asset acquisitions. Alignment Matters: For companies whose business is tied to Bitcoin, holding Bitcoin on their balance sheet reinforces their commitment and vision. Risk is Present: While the potential upside is clear, the inherent volatility of Bitcoin means this strategy is not without risk. Conclusion: A Bold Step for Fold’s Bitcoin Strategy Fold’s securing of a $250 million equity facility with the primary goal of acquiring more Bitcoin for its corporate treasury is a powerful statement. It reflects a calculated Bitcoin strategy aimed at leveraging the potential growth of the digital asset while reinforcing the company’s identity within the ecosystem. This move adds another notable example to the growing list of companies embracing Institutional Bitcoin adoption, further solidifying Bitcoin’s position as a legitimate asset class for corporate balance sheets. As the Fold App continues to grow its user base, its own financial health, potentially boosted by a strong Crypto Treasury , could become an increasingly important factor.

The flagship coin dropped as much as $103,396 on Tuesday, which resulted in a similar move for the wider altcoin market. As a result of the heightened volatility, more than $513 million was liquidated from the crypto-leveraged market, with the long traders accounting for $421 million. Nevertheless, crypto traders remain optimistic for a bullish rally soon as shown by the BTC fear and greed index, which hovered around 68 percent. Bitcoin Demand Remains Strong As Coinpedia has pointed out severally in the recent past, the overall demand for Bitcoin by institutional investors remains highly elevated. Amid the ongoing short-term bearish outlook, the Bitcoin balance on centralized exchanges continued to drop to about 2.08 million at the time of this writing from 2.26 million on April 24, 2025. The U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs and institutional investors, led by Strategy and Metaplanet , remain a major contributor to the declining supply of BTC on centralized exchanges (CEXs). Over the past five days, U.S. spot BTC ETFs have recorded a net cash inflow of approximately $1.46 billion, led by BlackRock’s IBIT. What Next for BTC Price? BTC price has been forming a bullish continuation pattern despite the seemingly choppy market. Following a 5 percent drop in the past 24 hours to retest a crucial support level around $103k, BTC price has rebounded over 1 percent to trade around $105k on Tuesday, during the mid-North American trading session. In the two-hour timeframe, BTC price retested a bullish breakout from a falling logarithmic trendline. Within the 2-hour timeframe, BTC’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovered around oversold levels, suggesting a rebound in the near future. However, a consistent close below the support range between $103k and $101k will trigger further bearish sentiment in the subsequent weeks.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-price-retests-key-support-as-fomc-decision-looms-will-bulls-take-control/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-06-17T19:22:28,"How Flare Is Bringing XRP to DeFi","Flare is making headlines because it is transforming the place XRP will hold in decentralized finance (DeFi). Utilizing its native data infrastructure and applying new cross-chain asset protocols, Flare is unlocking opportunities for XRP holders to participate in the growing DeFi landscape—without sacrificing security or token custody. Key Takeaways Flare's native oracle and data validation stack ( FTSO + FDC ) enables safe, verifiable cross-chain action and distinguishes Flare from other Layer-1 blockchains. FXRP allows XRP holders to mint a 1:1 token representation on Flare, bringing one of the most liquid assets in crypto into DeFi in a non-custodial, EVM-compatible manner. The launch of USD₮0 stablecoin via LayerZero injected a spark into Flare's total value locked (TVL) to reach triple in under two weeks. Flare is designed to scale, and it's planned to support Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and other major assets via its FAssets protocol. Flare's canary network, Songbird, is crucial for update testing as well as keeping mainnet secure. What is Flare? Flare (FLR) is a Layer-1, full-stack blockchain optimized for data-hungry use cases and cross-chain interoperability. Its three core features are: Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO) , provides decentralized, enshrined data feeds natively on Flare. Flare Data Connector (FDC) , authenticates external blockchain data for Flare's EVM state, enabling trustless interoperability. FAssets , allows creation of fully collateralized Flare representations of non-smart-contract assets (e.g., XRP). How FAssets Work Compared to traditional wrapped tokens relying on custodial agents, Flare's FAssets system is collateralized and decentralized. Customers send XRP to a registered agent of the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The agent freezes collateral on Flare and, upon verification via FDC , FXRP is minted in a 1:1 ratio for the customer. The system uses multiple layers of collateral: 1x underlying asset (XRP) FLR pool collateral (typically >1.5x FXRP value) Stablecoin collateral (~1.2x FXRP value) More than 2x system collateralization for robust protection. Multi-signature escrows, daily release of funds, and an Alert Mode in the event of emergencies lock up user funds. Regular audits and bug bounties add to security too. Songbird: Flare's Canary Network Songbird is Flare's production-grade testnet, where new protocols and features (like FAssets v1.1) are piloted in real economic conditions before being deployed on mainnet. The rapid uptake—$2 million of FXRP minted over four days—is a sign of strong demand and provides helpful learnings for Flare's mainnet launch. The USDT0 Effect The introduction of USDT0 (an omnichain version of Tether's USDT, issued via LayerZero) was a breakthrough for Flare. Over a remarkable 13-day period, Flare’s total value locked (TVL) surged from $37.1 million to more than $120.9 million, reflecting a rapid influx of liquidity and user engagement. This momentum has continued, and as of June 2025, Flare’s TVL has soared past $148 million —a testament to the platform’s growing appeal in the DeFi space. A significant driver of this growth has been the introduction of USD₮0, which now makes up 63% of all stablecoin liquidity on Flare. The addition of other stablecoins like USDC and USDX has further diversified the ecosystem, reducing the platform’s dependence on any single issuer and enhancing its overall stability. To incentivize participation, Flare launched the USDT₀ Boost programme, offering users up to 30% APY in rFLR tokens. This attractive yield, combined with Flare’s policy of refunding gas fees for USD₮0 transactions, has made it easier and more cost-effective for users to engage with DeFi protocols on the platform. These initiatives have not only fueled TVL growth but have also positioned Flare as a welcoming and innovative environment for both new and experienced DeFi participants. XRP's DeFi Moment XRP's vast liquidity and user base were, for years, excluded from DeFi, as XRPL lacked support for smart contracts. Flare's FAssets protocol turns this on its head. Companies like Uphold and VivoPower are offering significant XRP on Flare, affirming the FAssets thesis and freeing up new yield potential for institutional investors. Incidentally, XRPFi unlocks DeFi for the masses, enabling them to lend, borrow, yield farm, and provide liquidity with their XRP — at the expense of custody. stXRP and Firelight Flare will introduce liquid staking to XRP through the Firelight protocol. How It Works: Investors lock up FXRP in Firelight's Launch Vault and receive stXRP (an ERC-20 token) on a 1:1 basis. stXRP can be applied in any DeFi protocol while the underlying FXRP is staked, earning rewards. stXRP can be collateral, liquidity, or a yield-generating asset anywhere in the XRPFi ecosystem. Beyond XRP Flare’s vision extends beyond XRP. The FAssets protocol will soon support other major assets like Bitcoin (FBTC) and Dogecoin (FDOGE), using the same trust-minimized bridge architecture to mobilize liquidity from additional ecosystems. Flare’s Pivotal Role in DeFi’s Next Wave Flare is positioning itself as the go-to platform for XRP-based DeFi activity through its strong infrastructure, strict security standards, and increasing institutional attention. By connecting XRP's idle liquidity to the programmable universe of DeFi, Flare is not just adding to XRP's utility but also pushing wider blockchain adoption. With liquid staking and newer FAssets coming online, the XRPFi story gains traction. Flare's methodology sets a new standard for cross-chain DeFi innovation.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9600/how-flare-is-bringing-xrp-to-defi,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|XRP","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-06-17T19:10:02,"Donald Trump's sons are indirectly connected to Tron's plans to go public in US","Dominari Securities, a New York-based boutique investment bank, managed to secure a deal for Justin Sun’s digital asset platform Tron to go public in the US months after the pause of its fraud investigation. However, the bubble burst after Dominari securities were linked with Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. It all started after Tron’s announcement on Monday that it plans to go public in the US. According to reports, the digital platform will go public via a reverse merger with SRM Entertainment. This Nasdaq-listed company previously designed merchandise for theme parks before transitioning to crypto. The deal was brokered by Dominari Securities, which operates out of Trump Tower. The president’s sons joined their parent company, Dominari Holdings’ advisory board, earlier this year, which means they were involved in the setup. According to reports, the two joined Dominari Holdings’ advisory board in February and received 750,000 shares each in part. They were given 250,000 and another 500,000 upon joining when the company hit a market cap milestone. SRM Entertainment plans to raise $100 million from a private investor to buy TRON tokens and issue preferred shares and warrants that value the deal up to $210 million. SRM said it plans to rebrand as Tron Inc., with Sun joining as an advisor. SRM said it will stake the TRON token, distribute dividends, and build long-term shareholder value through digital asset exposure, like Michael Saylor’s Strategy. Eric Trump has been mentioned in the new TRX treasury firm. Although the President’s sons have been linked to Dominari’s holdings, Eric Trump has since denied any “public involvement” with Sun’s new venture. Sun has long been seen as one of the most controversial people in the crypto business, and he is known for pulling stunts to get attention. Dominari securities linked to Musk American Bitcoin, the US crypto miner backed by the pair, was originally a wholly owned subsidiary of Dominari Holdings. It was previously called American Data Centers but rebranded in late March in a joint venture with another miner, Hut 8, to develop Bitcoin mining and a strategic reserve of the token. Several of Elon Musk’s private companies, such as SpaceX and xAI, have also raised millions of dollars with help from Dominari Securities. In addition, the new crypto-friendly rules put in place by Trump have helped big campaign donors who run crypto firms and Elon Musk, who spent almost $300 million to help Trump win. He has big Bitcoin interests through his electric car company, Tesla, and other businesses. Although Trump and Musk have a bad relationship now, the tech mogul’s crypto fortunes seem to have gotten better because of Trump’s plan to loosen regulations. Justin Sun’s relationship with the Trump family According to reports, Justin Sun has had ties with Trump and his crypto ventures. Soon after Trump was elected, Sun became an adviser and investor in World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto company. He also bought $75 million worth of their memecoin, $TRUMP, as soon as it came out in January. The bond was built further after Sun claimed to be the largest holder of Trump’s memecoin and won a dinner invitation with the president as a top token holder. He publicly flaunted a $100,000 Donald Trump-branded watch he was awarded at a private dinner at Trump’s Virginia golf club. Thank you Tron!!! @justinsuntron @worldlibertyfi #USD1 https://t.co/6CvSaIs04H — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) June 11, 2025 On June 11, Sun announced that the first batch of USD1, a stablecoin issued by World Liberty Financial, a so-called DeFi project linked to the Trump family, had been minted on the Tron network. Sun was identified as the project’s largest investor and an adviser.

This funding injection is set to propel the company’s ambitious shift, particularly focusing on a new Bitcoin strategy and broader crypto expansion within the burgeoning decentralized AI landscape. What’s Driving TAO Alpha’s Pivot? The core of TAO Alpha’s recent announcement revolves around a £5 million (approximately $6.8 million) convertible loan. This financial maneuver, reported by Investing.com, underpins a fundamental change in the company’s direction. Historically, the company’s focus may have been elsewhere, but this new funding is explicitly tied to embracing the future of decentralized AI and cryptocurrency markets. This isn’t just about securing funds; it’s about redefining the company’s asset management and strategic priorities. The introduction of a new treasury policy is a clear indicator of this shift. Under this policy, TAO Alpha is now permitted to hold a significant portion of its cash reserves – up to two-thirds – in leading digital assets like Bitcoin and stablecoins. This move positions the company to potentially benefit from the growth and stability offered by these assets, integrating them directly into its financial framework. To manage this new digital asset focus, TAO Alpha has established a subsidiary in Singapore. Singapore is recognized globally as a hub for financial technology and cryptocurrency innovation, making it a strategic location for overseeing the company’s digital asset management activities. Exploring the New Bitcoin Strategy The adoption of a treasury policy allowing substantial holdings in Bitcoin and stablecoins is a bold statement for a UK-listed company. This Bitcoin strategy moves beyond simple investment; it integrates Bitcoin and stablecoins into the core financial operations of TAO Alpha. Here’s what this could entail: Asset Diversification: Moving cash reserves into Bitcoin and stablecoins diversifies the company’s balance sheet away from traditional fiat currencies. Potential Growth Exposure: Holding Bitcoin offers exposure to the potential upside of the cryptocurrency market leader. Stability with Stablecoins: Utilizing stablecoins provides a digital asset alternative to traditional cash that can be used for operational needs while maintaining value relative to fiat. Strategic Alignment: This policy aligns the company’s financial structure with its new strategic focus on the crypto and decentralized AI sectors. This approach reflects a growing trend among forward-thinking companies who see digital assets not just as speculative instruments but as viable components of a modern corporate treasury. Fueling Crypto Expansion and Decentralized AI Ambitions The £5 million loan is earmarked for specific growth initiatives directly tied to TAO Alpha’s crypto expansion and its entry into decentralized AI. The funding is planned for: Development within the Bittensor Ecosystem: A significant portion of the funds is directed towards building and developing within the Bittensor network. Team Expansion: Growing the team is crucial to support the technical and operational demands of working in the complex fields of decentralized AI and cryptocurrency. This dual focus indicates that TAO Alpha isn’t just investing in crypto assets; it’s actively participating in building the future infrastructure of decentralized intelligence. Why Bittensor? Understanding the Ecosystem The specific focus on the Bittensor ecosystem highlights TAO Alpha’s interest in a particular niche within decentralized AI. Bittensor is a decentralized network that aims to create a market for machine intelligence. It uses a blockchain to incentivize participants to train and contribute to machine learning models. Think of it as a decentralized network of incentivized intelligence. Investing and developing within Bittensor means TAO Alpha is likely looking to contribute computational power, develop specific AI models, or build applications that leverage the intelligence available on the network. This aligns perfectly with a strategic pivot towards decentralized AI, leveraging a platform designed explicitly for this purpose. Navigating the World of Decentralized AI Decentralized AI is a rapidly evolving field that seeks to distribute the training, deployment, and ownership of artificial intelligence models across decentralized networks, often utilizing blockchain technology. Unlike traditional AI where models are typically owned and controlled by large corporations, decentralized AI aims for greater transparency, accessibility, and censorship resistance. TAO Alpha’s move into this space, specifically via Bittensor , positions it at the forefront of this technological convergence. The challenges include the complexity of the technology, regulatory uncertainty, and the nascent nature of the market. However, the potential benefits – participating in a potentially fairer and more open AI ecosystem – are significant drivers for companies like TAO Alpha. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges? TAO Alpha’s strategic shift comes with potential rewards and risks: Potential Benefits: Early Mover Advantage: Positioning itself in decentralized AI and integrating Bitcoin into its treasury could offer a competitive edge. Exposure to High-Growth Markets: Both the crypto market (especially Bitcoin) and decentralized AI are sectors with significant growth potential. Alignment with Future Trends: Embracing decentralization and digital assets aligns the company with major technological and financial trends. Potential Challenges: Market Volatility: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are known for price swings, which could impact the value of TAO Alpha’s treasury holdings. Technological Complexity: Developing within ecosystems like Bittensor requires specialized expertise. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for both crypto and decentralized AI is still developing and varies significantly by jurisdiction. Execution Risk: Successfully pivoting the company’s strategy and executing development plans in new areas is inherently challenging. Looking Ahead: What Does This Mean for TAO Alpha? The £5 million loan provides the necessary capital for TAO Alpha to actively pursue its new direction. The focus on a robust Bitcoin strategy , coupled with targeted investment in Bittensor and Decentralized AI development, suggests a long-term vision centered on integrating cutting-edge technology with modern financial practices. This crypto expansion is not merely speculative; it appears to be an attempt to build tangible value within the decentralized web. Investors and market observers will be watching closely to see how TAO Alpha executes this pivot, manages its new digital asset treasury, and contributes to the rapidly evolving decentralized AI space. The success of this strategy will depend on navigating the inherent volatility and complexity of these markets while building a strong foundation within ecosystems like Bittensor. Summary TAO Alpha’s securing of a £5 million convertible loan marks a pivotal moment, signaling a clear strategic shift towards embracing digital assets and decentralized technology. The company is implementing a significant Bitcoin strategy by allowing up to two-thirds of its cash reserves to be held in Bitcoin and stablecoins, managed by a new Singapore subsidiary. This financial restructuring is designed to support its broader crypto expansion efforts, particularly focusing on development within the Bittensor ecosystem and building a team capable of operating in the complex world of Decentralized AI . While challenges exist, this move positions TAO Alpha to potentially capitalize on high-growth sectors and align itself with the future of finance and technology.

2025-06-17T18:56:07,"Trump Brands Himself ‘Crypto President’ Citing Stablecoin Bill and Bitcoin Reserve as a New Meme Coin Disrupts the Market","Donald Trump has proclaimed himself the “crypto president,” spotlighting his push for the GENIUS Act and a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. His bold statement, delivered via a pre-recorded message at Coinbase’s State of Crypto Summit in 2025, underscores his ambition to reshape the crypto market. The GENIUS Act aims to legitimize stablecoins, while Trump’s reserve idea hints at a future where Bitcoin anchors national finance. Meanwhile, a fresh contender, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , has surged into the spotlight, raising $624,785 in its presale. This new cryptocurrency, built on a meme-powered Layer 2 chain, is capturing investor frenzy. Why is this the best crypto to buy now? Let’s explore. GENIUS Act Fuels Stablecoin Surge Trump’s GENIUS Act has ignited excitement in the crypto market. This legislation establishes a federal framework for stablecoins, ensuring each token is backed 1:1 by U.S. dollars or Treasury bills. Only regulated banks or state-approved entities can issue them. Monthly transparency reports, signed by CEOs, are mandatory. For issuers exceeding $10 billion, federal oversight tightens. This move aims to stabilize crypto prices and boost investor confidence. Stablecoins, now a $232 billion market, are gaining traction. Consequently, Trump’s push could redefine crypto investment, making stablecoins a cornerstone of digital finance. But another project is stealing the show. Bitcoin Reserve Sparks Debate Trump’s vision for a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has stirred the crypto market. Although no official reserve exists, his claim suggests bold plans for 2025. Bitcoin, recently dipping to $107,680, remains a focal point for crypto predictions. Trump’s rhetoric aligns with Coinbase’s lobbying, backed by millions in political donations. This reserve could position the U.S. as a crypto powerhouse. However, skepticism persists about its feasibility. Investors are eyeing crypto prices today, wondering if Bitcoin will soar or face a crypto crash. Meanwhile, a new token is offering a fresh alternative. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is drawing attention with its innovative approach. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Redefines Meme Coins Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has emerged as a top crypto to buy. Built on a Layer 2 blockchain, it promises ultra-low fees and blazing-fast transactions. Unlike Ethereum’s high gas costs, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) ensures affordability. Its ecosystem includes a meme coin launchpad, fostering new projects. Sniper bots, a plague in crypto trading, won’t work here. Anonymous experts, behind top meme coins, are backing Little Pepe (LILPEPE). Listings on two major exchanges are confirmed for launch, with plans to target the world’s biggest exchange. With a post-launch price prediction of $1.50, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is a must-watch for crypto investment. Moreover, its unique features set it apart. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Presale and Giveaway The Little Pepe (LILPEPE) presale has raised $624,785, with stage two underway at $0.0011 per token. Investors are rushing to secure tokens before stage three’s price increase to $0.0012. The project’s $777,000 giveaway is fueling excitement. Ten winners will each receive $77,000 in tokens by contributing $100 to the presale and completing tasks like sharing and tagging friends. This giveaway amplifies the project’s appeal in the crypto market. Furthermore, Little Pepe (LILPEPE)’s tokenomics—10% for liquidity, 26.5% for presale, and zero tax—make it a prime crypto investment. The project’s momentum is undeniable. Crypto Market’s Bright Horizon Trump’s crypto-friendly policies and Little Pepe (LILPEPE)’s rise have energized the crypto market. The GENIUS Act could stabilize crypto prices, while a Bitcoin reserve might elevate Bitcoin’s value. Yet, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) stands out as the best crypto to buy now. Its Layer 2 chain, meme coin launchpad, and expert backing promise explosive growth. Investors are flocking to its presale, driven by FOMO and a $1.50 price prediction. The crypto fear and greed index is tilting toward greed, signaling opportunity. Don’t miss out, join the Little Pepe (LILPEPE) presale today and ride the wave of this new cryptocurrency.

This isn’t just another funding round; it’s a strategic push to accumulate one of the world’s most sought-after digital assets on a large scale. The news highlights a fascinating trend where companies are increasingly looking beyond traditional financial instruments to manage their reserves. Understanding DDC Enterprise’s Bold Bitcoin Move So, what exactly happened? DDC Enterprise announced it secured $528 million through a series of securities purchase agreements. Think of this as selling a stake in the company or a future claim on its assets in exchange for immediate cash. The primary purpose? To acquire Bitcoin . The company has made it clear that the vast majority of these newly acquired funds are earmarked specifically for building a significant corporate holding of the cryptocurrency. This isn’t a small side project; DDC Enterprise aims to position itself among the companies with the largest corporate Bitcoin treasuries globally. Key players involved in this massive raise include prominent names from the crypto and blockchain world: Animoca Brands: A major force in blockchain gaming and the metaverse space. Their participation underscores the convergence of different digital sectors. QCP Capital: A well-known Singapore-based crypto trading firm. Their involvement suggests confidence in the market’s future trajectory and Bitcoin’s role within it. The fact that established players like Animoca Brands and QCP Capital are backing this initiative speaks volumes about the perceived value and strategic importance of holding Bitcoin as a corporate asset. Why Are Companies Building Bitcoin Treasuries? DDC Enterprise isn’t operating in a vacuum. A growing number of companies, most famously led by MicroStrategy, have been adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. But why? What’s the allure of holding a volatile digital asset instead of traditional cash or bonds? Here are some key reasons driving the trend of building a Bitcoin treasury : Inflation Hedge: With concerns about inflation rising globally, many see Bitcoin, with its capped supply (only 21 million ever), as a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Store of Value: Often referred to as ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a reliable store of value in the digital age, similar to how gold has been viewed historically. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin can provide diversification away from traditional financial assets, which may behave differently during economic shifts. Exposure to a New Asset Class: Holding Bitcoin gives companies direct exposure to the burgeoning digital economy and the potential growth of cryptocurrencies. Forward-Thinking Strategy: For some companies, holding Bitcoin is seen as a forward-thinking strategic move, signaling adaptability and a willingness to embrace future financial paradigms. For DDC Enterprise, an e-commerce company, integrating this level of crypto investment into its treasury strategy could also align with potential future plans involving blockchain, digital payments, or loyalty programs, though the primary stated goal here is asset accumulation. The Scale and Significance of $528 Million Let’s put this number into perspective. $528 million is a substantial amount of capital. While it might not immediately place DDC Enterprise at the very top of the list of corporate Bitcoin holders (MicroStrategy holds billions worth), it certainly propels them into the ranks of companies with significant exposure. This level of crypto investment from an e-commerce company, backed by major players like Animoca Brands and QCP Capital, underscores a few important points: Institutional Confidence: It demonstrates increasing confidence from institutional investors and crypto-native firms in the long-term viability and value proposition of Bitcoin as a corporate asset. Sector Diversification: It shows that the trend of building a corporate Bitcoin treasury is spreading beyond just tech or financial companies into sectors like e-commerce. Market Impact: A half-billion-dollar allocation to Bitcoin can have a noticeable impact on market dynamics, especially during periods of lower liquidity. It represents significant buy pressure. The ambition to build ‘one of the largest corporate Bitcoin treasuries’ is a bold statement and indicates a long-term commitment to this strategy by DDC Enterprise. Potential Benefits and Challenges Embarking on such a large-scale crypto investment strategy comes with potential upsides and risks. Potential Benefits: Asset Appreciation: If the price of Bitcoin increases, the value of DDC Enterprise’s treasury holding would grow significantly, potentially boosting the company’s balance sheet. Attracting Investment: A strong Bitcoin position might attract investors interested in companies with exposure to digital assets. Industry Leadership: Becoming a major corporate Bitcoin holder could position DDC Enterprise as a leader or innovator in its sector regarding financial strategy. Potential Challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is known for its significant volatility. A sharp downturn could negatively impact the company’s financial statements. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions, which could pose risks. Accounting and Reporting: Managing and reporting Bitcoin holdings can be complex from an accounting perspective. Security Risks: Storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss. DDC Enterprise, with the backing of experienced crypto firms like QCP Capital, is likely well aware of these challenges and presumably has strategies in place to mitigate them. What Does This Mean for the Future? The DDC Enterprise raise and subsequent plan to expand its Bitcoin treasury is more than just a company-specific event; it’s a data point in the broader narrative of institutional and corporate adoption of cryptocurrencies. It suggests that despite market fluctuations, the underlying conviction in Bitcoin as a long-term asset class remains strong among sophisticated investors and forward-thinking companies. The involvement of Animoca Brands also highlights the increasing integration of crypto assets across various digital industries, from finance and e-commerce to gaming and the metaverse. For other companies observing this trend, DDC Enterprise’s move provides another case study. It might encourage more businesses to explore the possibility of a corporate Bitcoin strategy, especially as the infrastructure for holding and managing digital assets becomes more accessible and regulated. In Conclusion: A Strategic Leap into Digital Assets DDC Enterprise’s successful $528 million raise, with notable participation from Animoca Brands and QCP Capital, marks a significant strategic leap for the e-commerce company. By dedicating the majority of these funds to building a substantial Bitcoin treasury , DDC Enterprise is making a bold statement about its belief in the future of digital assets and its ambition to become a major player in the corporate Bitcoin space. This move underscores the growing trend of companies seeking alternative stores of value and diversification in an evolving global economy, further solidifying Bitcoin’s position on the corporate balance sheet.

2025-06-17T18:45:28,"Goldman Sachs Says US Experiencing Disinflation if Not for Tariffs, Predicts Federal Reserve Cutting Rates Later This Year – Here’s When","Goldman Sachs vice chairman Robert Kaplan thinks the US economy would be in a deflationary situation right now if not for President Donald Trump’s wave of tariffs. Kaplan, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, tells CNBC in a new interview that recent inflation numbers suggest the possibility of rate cuts later this year. “We’re in a disinflating world, and I think if it weren’t for these prospective tariffs that will flow through and are flowing through, I think the Fed would be on their front foot to be looking to cut rates now.” Inflation rose by 2.4% in May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was slightly less than the 2.5% increase predicted by economists. Kaplan notes that the Fed will watch to see where the tariffs are set in the next several weeks and how they flow through the economy. “I think if I were at the Fed, it would encourage me that, after we get over the horizon, maybe the tariff impact could be more muted than I fear.” The Goldman vice chairman also comments on Fed Futures , which estimate the market-implied probability of changes to the Federal Reserve’s benchmark interest rate at upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings. “Directionally, what I make of the Fed Futures is the first meeting where there’s a real meaningful probability of a cut is September. So what I take from it, which I think is about right, is no action in June, unlikely in July. The Fed, though, it will likely prepare itself and prepare in its comments that it might take action into the fall. But we still don’t know what the tariff rates are, and we still have a budget and tax bill that has not yet been passed, and we’ll see over the summer what the details of that are.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-17T18:41:21,"Coinbase Seeking SEC Approval for Tokenized Stock Trading in Push To Compete With Robinhood: Report","The top US-based crypto exchange by volume is looking for U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval of tokenized equities offerings. According to a new Reuters report , Coinbase is in talks with the SEC to offer what is essentially blockchain-based stock trading. In tokenized equities, company shares are converted into digital tokens that represent the securities, similar to how other real-world-based digital assets work already. The benefits of tokenized equities include around-the-clock trading, quicker trading times, and reduced trading costs. Tokenized equities are not currently available for trade in the US, though other US-based exchanges, such as Kraken, are already looking into the sector. Reuters reports that Coinbase needs one of two things from the SEC in order to make the offering – either a no-action letter or exemptive relief, which is a pledge not to pursue legal ramifications. Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal could not say whether or not the company has submitted an official request to the SEC yet. “With a no action letter, an issuer of a tokenized equity or a platform that wishes to offer secondary trading in those equities can have some confidence, some comfort, that the SEC has adopted its view of why this product is compliant. It’s that confidence that has been lacking so far, and I think really held back a lot of the institutional adoption…” The potential move would allow Coinbase to compete with other top trading apps like Robinhood.

2025-06-17T18:40:48,"Canadian Fintech LQwD Strengthens Bitcoin Holdings, Now Totals 166 BTC","BitcoinWorld Canadian Fintech LQwD Strengthens Bitcoin Holdings, Now Totals 166 BTC In a move highlighting the continued interest of corporate entities in digital assets, Canadian fintech company LQwD announced a strategic addition to its cryptocurrency reserves. The firm recently completed an acquisition of 5 additional Bitcoin, a step that reinforces its commitment to the leading digital currency. What is LQwD’s Latest Bitcoin Purchase? According to a report by Newsfile, LQwD Technologies Inc. (TSXV: LQWD) officially disclosed its latest acquisition. The company purchased an additional 5 Bitcoin (BTC), building upon its existing cryptocurrency portfolio. This transaction brings LQwD’s total LQwD Bitcoin holdings to a significant 166 BTC. This incremental purchase, while seemingly small compared to the total, demonstrates a consistent strategy by the company to accumulate and hold Bitcoin as part of its corporate treasury assets. For companies operating in the fintech space, particularly those involved with blockchain technology or the Lightning Network (which LQwD specializes in), holding Bitcoin can align with their core business and investment philosophy. This recent LQwD BTC purchase is a tangible example of this alignment in action. Why Are Canadian Companies Increasing Bitcoin Holdings? LQwD is not an isolated case. The trend of Canadian company Bitcoin adoption for treasury purposes has been gaining momentum. Several factors are driving this shift: Inflation Hedge: In an environment of potential currency devaluation, companies view Bitcoin as a potential store of value due to its fixed supply and decentralized nature. Potential Appreciation: Despite volatility, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term growth potential, attracting companies looking to enhance their balance sheet value. Alignment with Business: For crypto-native or fintech companies, holding Bitcoin can be seen as supporting the ecosystem they operate within and demonstrating confidence in the technology. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a traditional portfolio of cash and equivalents can offer diversification benefits, though it comes with higher risk. This growing trend reflects a broader acceptance and understanding of digital assets within the corporate world, moving beyond just individual investor interest. Understanding Institutional Bitcoin Investment The move by LQwD is part of a larger global phenomenon of institutional Bitcoin investment . Major corporations worldwide, such as MicroStrategy, Tesla, and others, have allocated significant portions of their corporate treasuries to Bitcoin. This signals a shift from Bitcoin being solely a retail asset to one considered seriously by sophisticated financial players and large businesses. The decision to add Bitcoin to a Bitcoin corporate treasury involves careful consideration of risks and rewards. While the potential for substantial gains exists, companies must also navigate the asset’s inherent price volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and the complexities of secure custody. Benefits often cited by companies holding Bitcoin include: Potential Benefit Description Store of Value Protection against inflation and currency debasement. Growth Potential Opportunity for significant capital appreciation. Balance Sheet Enhancement Potentially boosts company valuation if BTC price rises. Industry Leadership Positioning as forward-thinking and innovative, especially for tech companies. However, the challenges are equally important: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings, impacting the balance sheet. Regulatory Risk: The legal and regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Security: Securely storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires specialized knowledge and infrastructure. Accounting Treatment: Accounting rules for digital assets can be complex and vary by region. Despite these challenges, the increasing number of companies making a LQwD BTC purchase or similar acquisitions suggests that many see the potential rewards as outweighing the risks in the long term. The Significance of LQwD’s 166 BTC Holdings While 166 BTC may not rival the holdings of giants like MicroStrategy, it represents a substantial commitment for a company like LQwD. At current market prices, this holding constitutes a significant asset on their balance sheet. It indicates that LQwD views Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset but as a core component of its financial strategy and potentially a strategic resource for its Lightning Network-focused business operations. The decision to increase their LQwD Bitcoin holdings underscores confidence in the future of Bitcoin and its underlying technology. It positions LQwD among a growing list of publicly traded companies globally, and specifically in Canada, that are allocating capital to digital assets. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Investment in Canada? LQwD’s latest purchase contributes to the narrative of increasing crypto adoption within the Canadian corporate landscape. Canada has been relatively progressive in its approach to cryptocurrencies, with regulated Bitcoin ETFs and a growing ecosystem of crypto businesses. Moves like LQwD’s further legitimize digital assets as a viable asset class for corporate treasuries and institutional portfolios within the country. As more Canadian company Bitcoin holdings become public knowledge, it could potentially encourage other firms to explore similar strategies, further accelerating the integration of cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system in Canada. Conclusion LQwD’s recent acquisition of 5 additional Bitcoin, bringing its total to 166 BTC, is a clear signal of the company’s continued conviction in the digital asset. This move aligns with a broader trend of institutional adoption and the strategic allocation of Bitcoin to corporate treasuries by companies seeking potential hedges against inflation and long-term growth opportunities. As the cryptocurrency market matures, actions like LQwD’s highlight the increasing role digital assets are playing in the financial strategies of forward-thinking companies worldwide, including here in Canada.

2025-06-17T18:35:32,"Trump’s Crypto Reserve to Make XRP the Next Big Winner as XRP Eyes $1000 on SWIFT Replacement Theory","Patrick Bet-David, CEO of Valuetainment and host of the PBD Podcast, has made a bold prediction regarding XRP, suggesting that a recent development could trigger a significant price surge. In a video , Bet-David analyzed a key event that might shape the future of XRP and the broader cryptocurrency market, urging investors to “pay attention” to what could be unfolding. Notably, the catalyst for Bet-David’s discussion was President Donald Trump’s March 2 announcement of his intention to establish a U.S. crypto strategic reserve, akin to Fort Knox for gold. Notably, Trump’s post listed XRP first among cryptocurrencies, ahead of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bet-David noted he found this prioritization surprising and speculated that it could signal growing institutional interest and potential regulatory clarity that may benefit XRP. Bet-David further highlighted XRP’s potential to replace SWIFT, the global messaging network for interbank payments, which currently processes approximately $5 trillion in transactions daily, totaling $1.25 quadrillion annually. He suggested that if XRP were to capture even 5-10% of SWIFT’s volume , its price could rise dramatically. Notably, analysts have speculated that such adoption could push XRP’s market cap to $10 trillion, potentially elevating its price to $100 per token. In a scenario where XRP fully replaces SWIFT, the token could theoretically reach $1,000. Additionally, he pointed to XRP’s increasing institutional usage. Over 300 financial institutions, including Bank of America and American Express, have integrated RippleNet , signaling strong industry interest. Furthermore, Ripple’s partnerships with governments for central bank digital currency (CBDC) infrastructure add to its credibility. Despite its potential, Bet-David acknowledged XRP’s challenges, particularly regulatory scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He mentioned Ripple’s seven-year-long legal battle with the SEC, noting that the lawsuit has slowed XRP’s adoption. However, he pointed out that with SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s potential departure in 2025, the case could be resolved, paving the way for institutional adoption. “Who knows what’s going to be happening? When the president puts XRP at the top of the list in his Truth Social post, followed by a retweet mentioning Bitcoin and Ethereum, it makes you wonder, maybe something is about to happen,” Bet-David speculated. Bet-David clarified that he is not an XRP maximalist, noting that his Bitcoin holdings far exceed his XRP stake. However, he predicted a significant surge for XRP in the near future. “I would be paying attention,” he advised. “The next 3, 6, or 12 months could be game-changing for XRP.”",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/trumps-crypto-reserve-to-make-xrp-the-next-big-winner-as-xrp-eyes-1000-on-swift-replacement-theory/,"BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP","Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare
2025-06-17T18:31:48,"Bitcoin ETF Inflows Soar: $1.78 Billion Boost Signals Strong Confidence","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETF Inflows Soar: $1.78 Billion Boost Signals Strong Confidence Are you watching the markets? Recent data reveals a significant surge in capital flowing into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF products. This trend is grabbing headlines and signaling renewed investor confidence in the leading cryptocurrency. What’s Driving the Latest Wave of Bitcoin ETF Inflows ? The past week has been particularly strong for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF s. They’ve collectively recorded six consecutive days of net inflows, a clear indicator that buyers are stepping in. The total net inflow over this period reached an impressive $1.78 billion . Let’s break down the recent activity: Six Straight Days of Inflows: This consistent positive flow demonstrates sustained buying pressure, not just a one-off event. Total Over Six Days: The cumulative total of $1.78 billion is substantial, highlighting the scale of investment entering the market via these regulated products. June 16th Standout: A single day, June 16th, saw $412.2 million added to the funds. BlackRock’s IBIT fund continues to lead the pack, attracting a significant portion of these inflows. On June 16th alone, IBIT recorded $266.6 million in net inflows. While there was a temporary scare involving a reported $10 billion outflow from the ARKB fund due to a data error, corrected figures quickly confirmed that ARKB, like its peers, experienced continued net inflows, reinforcing the positive trend. How Significant Are These Total Spot Bitcoin ETF Figures? Looking at the bigger picture since their launch in January, the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF market has grown dramatically. These recent inflows add to an already impressive cumulative total. Consider these figures: Total Net Inflows (Cumulative): Across all U.S. Bitcoin ETFs, total net inflows now exceed $46.3 billion . This figure represents the net capital added to these funds after accounting for both inflows and outflows (including the initial significant outflows from Grayscale’s GBTC as investors transitioned). Assets Under Management (AUM): The total value of assets held within these ETFs has surpassed $123 billion . This AUM figure reflects the value of the underlying Bitcoin held by the funds, which fluctuates with the Bitcoin price , plus the cumulative net inflows. These numbers underscore the significant impact these investment vehicles have had on making Bitcoin accessible to a wider range of investors, particularly institutions and traditional finance participants. What About Other Crypto ETF Products? While Bitcoin ETFs dominate the conversation due to their size and tenure, other cryptocurrency investment products are also emerging. The recent approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. marks another milestone for the industry. While the Ethereum ETFs have yet to launch trading, associated products are seeing activity: Spot Ethereum ETF Inflows: On June 16th, spot Ethereum ETFs saw $21.4 million in inflows. While smaller than Bitcoin, this indicates initial interest in regulated Ethereum exposure. The successful launch and performance of Bitcoin ETFs are paving the way for other crypto-linked investment products, potentially bringing more diverse capital into the digital asset space. How Are These Inflows Influencing the Bitcoin Price ? The correlation between significant ETF inflows and the Bitcoin price is a hot topic among analysts and investors. While not a direct cause-and-effect on a minute-by-minute basis, sustained buying pressure from these large funds provides underlying support and can contribute to upward price momentum. Currently, the Bitcoin price has managed to hold above the significant $100,000 mark. This level is being watched closely as a key psychological and technical support zone. Analysts are cautiously optimistic. They note that while the market is experiencing high volatility, the continued inflows into ETFs suggest underlying demand. If the price can maintain support above the $102,000 level (a slightly higher, more specific technical level mentioned by some analysts) and investor confidence remains high, there is potential for further upside. Key Price Considerations: Current Support: Holding above $100,000 is seen as crucial. Technical Level: The $102,000 mark is another important support level being monitored. Volatility: Expect price swings as the market digests news and macro factors. Buyer Confidence: Continued ETF inflows are a strong indicator of returning or sustained buyer confidence. The sustained buying via ETFs provides a potential buffer against significant downturns, although broader market sentiment and macroeconomic factors will also play a critical role in future price movements. What Are the Benefits and Challenges of This Trend? The rise of Spot Bitcoin ETF s and the subsequent inflows bring both opportunities and challenges: Benefits: Increased Accessibility: ETFs make investing in Bitcoin as easy as buying a stock through traditional brokerage accounts. Institutional Adoption: They provide a regulated and familiar vehicle for large institutions to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Market Legitimacy: The approval and success of these ETFs lend credibility to Bitcoin as an asset class. Potential Price Support: Sustained inflows represent consistent demand, which can support the Bitcoin price . Challenges: Market Volatility: While inflows can support price, Bitcoin remains a volatile asset. Correlation Risk: ETFs can increase the correlation between Bitcoin and traditional financial markets. Centralization Concerns: Large amounts of Bitcoin being held by a few major fund managers raise questions about centralization. Fee Structures: While generally low, ETF fees add a layer of cost compared to direct ownership. Actionable Insights: What Should Investors Consider? For those interested in the cryptocurrency market, the significant Bitcoin ETF inflows offer valuable insights: Monitor Inflow Data: Keep an eye on daily and weekly inflow figures for major ETFs like IBIT, FBTC, and ARKB. Sustained positive inflows are generally bullish signals. Watch Key Price Levels: Pay attention to whether the Bitcoin price holds critical support levels like $100,000 and $102,000. Understand the Macro Landscape: Bitcoin’s performance is increasingly linked to global economic conditions and monetary policy. Consider Diversification: While Bitcoin ETFs are strong performers, the crypto market is broad. Explore other assets and investment strategies. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Despite institutional interest, Bitcoin remains a high-risk asset. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Summary: A Bullish Signal Backed by Capital The recent streak of significant Bitcoin ETF inflows , totaling $1.78 billion over six days and pushing cumulative inflows past $46.3 billion, is a powerful indicator of strong and sustained investor interest. Led by funds like BlackRock’s IBIT, these inflows demonstrate the growing acceptance and accessibility of Bitcoin through regulated investment vehicles. While the market remains volatile, the ability of the Bitcoin price to hold above key support levels amidst this influx of capital suggests underlying strength and potential for future growth. The cautious optimism from analysts reflects the current state: a market navigating volatility but buoyed by fresh investment entering through the increasingly popular Spot Bitcoin ETF channel.

2025-06-17T18:30:50,"Rising Bitcoin Dominance Above 64% Dashes Hopes Of Altcoin Season, Here’s Why","Crypto analyst Daan Crypto has provided an analysis of the rising Bitcoin dominance, explaining why this will likely continue to surge. Based on his analysis, the altcoin season is unlikely to come anytime soon, with many alts suffering significant selling pressure while BTC accumulation increases. Bitcoin Dominance Surge Dashes Hopes Of Altcoin Season In an X post, Daan Crypto stated that the Bitcoin Dominance shows no signs of stopping following the latest surge above 64%. He indicated that the dominance will only continue to rise as more treasury companies try to accumulate Bitcoin. Meanwhile, on the other hand, hopes of an altcoin season fade away as many altcoins are plagued with big unlocks and downtrending momentum. Related Reading: Positioning For Altcoin Season: Analyst Reveals When To Buy As Bitcoin Dominance Rises Daan Crypto also alluded to how there was a short squeeze last month on Ethereum, which took a lot of coins with it. However, this momentum quickly faded afterwards, again dashing hopes of an altcoin season. The analyst explained that there wasn’t sufficient spot bid to bid most of these coins up further. Meanwhile, he cautioned market participants to pick their altcoin investments wisely. Daan Crypto remarked that most of them will underperform BTC over a larger timeframe. His warning suggests that the Bitcoin dominance will continue to trend upwards while an altcoin season may not happen anytime soon. Basically, there is a lack of interest and capital in these altcoins to spark an altcoin season, which could see them outperform BTC. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin dominance is surging thanks to massive adoption from institutional investors. These companies are looking to adopt Strategy’s playbook or gain exposure through the Bitcoin ETFs. BlockchainCenter data shows that it is still Bitcoin season and nowhere near altcoin season. For it to be altcoin season, 75% of the top 50 coins need to have outperformed BTC over the last 90 days. Only ten altcoins have outperformed the flagship crypto during this period. Altseason Is Still Coming, But Slowly In an X post, crypto analyst Astronomer assured that the altcoin season is still coming, although it could take a while. He noted that the price remains the same for these altcoins, but declared that nothing has changed. The analyst remarked that this lines up with the overall plan of the Bitcoin price ranging till the end of June and altcoins remaining in their local ranges. Related Reading: The Return Of Altcoin Season: Why Bitcoin Dominance Must Fall To 62% Astronomer also indicated that BTC needs to break out while the Bitcoin dominance remains below 65% for all parts of the plan for an altcoin season to be completed. The analyst urged market participants to be patient, expressing his confidence that an altcoin season would still occur. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $107,300, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

2025-06-17T18:19:53,"Can Tron price surge 60% and revisit December highs?","Tron price remained consolidated on Tuesday as investors reflected on the new public listing news. Tron ( TRX ) was trading at $0.2790, a few points above this week’s low of $0.2670. It has risen by almost 40% from its lowest level this year. The biggest Tron news is that it will execute a reverse merger with SRM Entertainment , a company that sells branded toys. Dominari Securities, a company with ties to the Trump family, is arranging this merger. The merger will see SRM accumulate TRX tokens, mimicking the strategy of Strategy, which transformed from a small tech company into the largest Bitcoin ( BTC ) holder. Strategy’s market capitalization has soared from $1 billion in 2020 to $105 billion today. The deal comes after the successful Circle IPO , which has pushed its market capitalization to over $33 billion. Other companies in the crypto industry, like Gemini, Galaxy Digital, and Kraken, are also considering going public late this year. You might also like: Tron’s $210m Nasdaq play is real. Eric Trump’s role? Not so much. Tron has grown into one of the largest cryptocurrencies, with a market capitalization of over $24 billion. It is also the second most profitable crypto project after Tether. According to TokenTerminal data , Tron has generated over $3.65 billion in revenue over the past 365 days, with $1.6 billion recorded so far this year. Most of these fees are either burned or distributed to super representatives. The token-burning mechanism contributes to Tron’s deflationary nature. Its circulating supply has dropped from 96.3 billion in June last year to 94.8 billion today. Tron price technical analysis TRX price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that TRX has been in a gradual uptrend in recent months, rising from a February low of $0.20 to $0.2743 today. The price has moved above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), signaling that bulls remain in control. Tron has also formed a cup-and-handle pattern, a popular continuation formation, and is currently developing the handle portion. If the pattern holds and TRX breaks above the year-to-date high of $0.2958, a continuation rally toward last year’s high of $0.4497, a roughly 60% upside, becomes increasingly likely.
