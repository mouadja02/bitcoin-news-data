2025-06-18T11:45:28,"Arthur Hayes Sounds Alarm on Emerging ‘Stablecoin Mania,’ Warns of Potential Repeat of Terra Luna’s $40,000,000,000 Collapse","BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes says Circle’s successful initial public offering (IPO) may have ignited the next major bubble in the crypto market. In a new blog post, Hayes warns that Circle’s stock market debut has marked the beginning of a “stablecoin mania” that he thinks will fleece investors who get caught up in the hype. According to the crypto veteran, Circle’s success will inspire a wave of new stablecoin issuers looking to capitalize on the hype, luring investors with promises of massive growth. “The bubble will pop after the launch of a stablecoin issuer on a public market, most likely in the US, that separates fools from tens of billions of capital by using a combination of financial engineering, leverage, and amazing showmanship… A very bankable charismatic individual will get on stage and spew all sorts of nonsense, wave his (most likely a male) hands to and fro, and convince you why the leveraged piece of dogshit he is selling is about to corner the multi-trillion dollar stablecoin total addressable market (TAM).” Hayes notes that the extent of the damage from the looming stablecoin mania will largely hinge on how the US chooses to regulate the sector. “The more freedom allowed to issuers in terms of what backs a stablecoin and whether they can pay yield to holders, the more financial engineering and leverage that can be used to mask a t*rd. If you assume a light to no touch stablecoin regulatory regime, then you could get a repeat of Terra/Luna in that an issuer creates some fugazi algorithmic stablecoin Ponzi. The issuer can pay high yield to holders and the yield comes from applying leverage to some holdings of assets.” In 2022, the Terra ecosystem collapsed after its algorithmic stablecoin LUNA lost its peg to the dollar, wiping out $40 billion in market value. For those looking to invest in other stablecoin issuers, Hayes says to keep a close watch on the project’s distribution channels. “If you stop reading here, the only question you must ask yourself when evaluating an investment in a stablecoin issuer is this: how will they distribute their product? To distribute at scale, and by that, I mean have the ability to reach millions of users affordably, an issuer must use the pipes of a crypto exchange, a Web2 social media Goliath, or a legacy bank. If they have no distribution, they have no chance of success. And if you can’t easily verify that said issuer has the access to push product through one or more of these channels, run away!” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-18T11:31:50,"Norwegian K33 launches new round of share issuance to purchase 1,000 BTC","Norwegian digital asset firm K33 wants to issue a round of shares to raise enough capital to buy as much as 1,000 BTC. The offering has already received full subscriptions. In an official press release , the Norwegian firm declared that it would issue new company shares in order to raise at least 85 million Swedish krona or equal to around $8.8 million. The digital asset firm has established the subscription price per share at 0.1036 SEK, matching the closing price on the Nasdaq First North Growth Market as of June 17. The capital raised from sales of the shares will be used to add more Bitcoin ( BTC ) to the company’s balance sheet. According to the release, the goal is to buy up to 1,000 BTC. Exposure to more Bitcoin will allow the company to diversify its holdings, improve margins and fuel scalable growth. The issuance has already attracted pre-commitments, including an investment by the CEO of K33, Torbjørn Bull Jenssen himself that amounts to about EUR 100,000. “We strongly believe that Bitcoin represents the future of global finance and are positioning K33 to benefit maximally from this,” said Jenssen in his statement. You might also like: Europe’s first Bitcoin Treasury firm plans to raise $340m to buy more BTC Aside from Jenssen, the company claimed that the shares have already gotten full subscription commitments from both existing and new investors. The minimum subscription and allocation amount in the Directed Share Issue will be a number of Offer Shares equal to EUR 100,000 per investor. However, the company may, at its sole discretion, offer and allocate amounts below the minimum. The application window opens from June 18 at 09:00 CEST and closes on June 19 at 17:30 CEST, though dates are still subject to change. However, by applying for shares, investors will automatically vote in favor of item 9 at an Extraordinary General Meeting on July 3, which would authorize the board to issue shares and financial instruments as needed. “Such undertaking applies to all shares in the Company held or controlled as of the record date for the EGM,” wrote the company in its notice. According to the release, share allocations will be decided by the board, considering factors like order size, existing holdings, and investor fit. Notification of allocation is expected around June 23, with settlement and share trading beginning in early July. Throughout the year, K33 has been accelerating its Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Earlier in May, the Norway-based firm raised 60 million SEK, worth about $5.6 million, from insiders and investors to boost its Bitcoin holdings.

2025-06-18T11:30:34,"Crypto’s Unlikely Ally: Top Analyst Reveals War As A Surprising Bullish Force","Crypto analyst Cyclop has made a potentially significant statement, claiming that the ongoing crisis between Israel and Iran may inadvertently boost the performance of digital assets. Despite recent volatility, which saw a sell-off of approximately $140 billion in the crypto market, Cyclop’s long-term analysis reveals a more optimistic outlook for the broader digital asset industry. Analyst Predicts Bullish Trends For Crypto Amid Conflicts In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Cyclop pointed to historical patterns that suggest geopolitical tensions often lead to bullish trends in cryptocurrency. Citing specific instances from April and October 2024, he noted that Bitcoin (BTC) experienced an initial decline of 18% and 10% respectively during these conflicts, only to rebound with impressive gains of 28% and 62% shortly thereafter. This trend, he argues, indicates a recurring cycle where war-related dips in crypto prices eventually transform into significant growth, as can be depicted in the chart below shared by Cyclop. Related Reading: On-Chain Analyst Warns: Bitcoin Peak Expected, Altcoins Facing -95% Plunge The analyst explains that while such conflicts can trigger short-term bearish movements, the overarching impact tends to be favorable for cryptocurrencies. As wars ignite fears of inflation and instability, Cyclop has noted that many investors for the traditional finance arena turn to crypto as a hedge against weakening fiat currencies. Unlike traditional bank accounts, cryptocurrencies are not subject to freezing, he said, making them appealing during times of geopolitical unrest. Increasingly, digital currencies are being viewed as a form of “digital gold,” a safe haven in tumultuous times. Favorable Macroeconomic Factors The current market dynamics echo previous events, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and US-Iran tensions in 2020, which similarly resulted in temporary dips followed by recoveries. Cyclop remains confident that the present situation will yield similar outcomes, despite the typical summer slowdown that often affects market activity. Supporting this bullish sentiment are favorable macroeconomic factors. Recent developments indicate that the US and China have reached a compromise, easing tariffs and aiming to stabilize global supply chains. This move is expected to help cool inflation and restore investor confidence. Moreover, President Donald Trump’s decision to delay new tariffs has contributed to a more risk-friendly environment, allowing liquidity to flow back into crypto markets. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sets The Stage For A Liftoff With Key Reversal Pattern Further aiding this positive outlook is the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which showed a modest increase of just 0.1% month-over-month, slightly below forecasts. With year-over-year inflation at 2.4%—down from an expected 2.5%—the Federal Reserve (Fed) is now anticipated to cut interest rates twice by the end of the year. Historically, such rate cuts have been bullish for cryptocurrencies, as they often lead to increased liquidity in the markets. While the immediate aftermath of the Israel-Iran conflict may present challenges, historical data suggests that cryptocurrencies have the potential to thrive in such environments.

2025-06-18T11:30:19,"James Wynn’s side wallet reportedly dumps massive MOONPIG supply","A wallet allegedly linked to James Wynn has offloaded over 10 million Moonpig tokens — a strategic de-risking or a desperate move to recover from recent liquidations? According to blockchain analyst @DataC5821 , the wallet in question dumped approximately 10.9 million Moonpig ( MOONPIG ) tokens worth $120.2K. On-chain data shows a rapid sequence of sell transactions clustered around the $14 million to $10 million market cap range, culminating in a crash to approximately $9.5 million at the time of reporting. Since then, the market cap has rebounded slightly, currently standing at $9.9 million.

You might also like: The full breakdown of James Wynn’s $1B Bitcoin positions — and how it all fell apart The analyst sarcastically responded that Wynn tends to “de-risk” only after getting liquidated on Hyperliquid, implying that the MOONPING dump may have had less to do with global events and more to do with covering personal trading losses. Whether driven by geopolitical risks or not, the recent sell-off follows Wynn’s reported $100 million liquidation on Hyperliquid in late May, triggered when Bitcoin ( BTC ) price dipped below $105,000. However, it’s still unclear whether Wynn actually incurred those losses. On June 13, crypto analyst Dethective challenged this narrative, suggesting that Wynn’s losses were not actual cash outs but rather reflected trading against his own positions.

2025-06-18T11:30:00,"Public Firms Turn to Capital Markets to Accelerate Bitcoin Accumulation","Two publicly listed firms have recently taken significant steps to grow their Bitcoin treasuries, reflecting the continued adoption of cryptocurrency as a corporate reserve asset. Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR) added approximately 10,000 BTC using proceeds from its latest preferred stock issuance, while BitMine Immersion Technologies (NYSE American: BMNR) finalized the purchase of over 150 BTC following a common stock offering. BitMine Immersion Technologies Completes $16.3M Bitcoin Treasury Acquisition Following Public Stock Offering BitMine Immersion Technologies, Inc. (NYSE American: BMNR), a publicly traded Bitcoin network infrastructure and investment company, has officially completed the deployment of all net proceeds from its recent equity raise into direct Bitcoin purchases, reinforcing its long-term strategy to build a Bitcoin-centric treasury model. In an announcement released Tuesday, the company revealed it had finalized the acquisition of 154.167 Bitcoin at an average price of $106,033 per coin, using $16.347 million—a sum that nearly mirrors the $16.340 million in net proceeds raised from its offering of common stock, which closed on June 6, 2025. A Bitcoin-First Corporate Treasury CEO Jonathan Bates commented on the milestone, saying, “We are very excited to establish our Bitcoin Treasury and fulfill our commitment to invest 100% of the transaction proceeds into Bitcoin,” said Bates. “This is not just a financial strategy—it’s a fundamental part of our identity as a Bitcoin-native business.” This direct investment marks one of the most aggressive treasury conversions to Bitcoin among US-listed public companies in 2025, aligning BitMine with the likes of Strategy and other Bitcoin-forward enterprises that have prioritized the digital asset over traditional fiat reserves. BitMine has differentiated itself from other crypto mining firms by blending traditional immersion cooling-based Bitcoin mining with emerging services in the synthetic hashrate and Bitcoin-denominated financial product sectors. The company operates mining sites in low-cost energy regions, including Trinidad, Pecos, Texas, and Silverton, where it can scale operations while minimizing energy expenditure—a critical component in maintaining profitability, especially in an increasingly competitive post-halving mining environment. Additionally, BitMine offers Bitcoin advisory services to public companies interested in navigating the complexities of earning and holding Bitcoin, either through direct mining or hashrate-related financial instruments. Market Context and Institutional Confidence The announcement comes at a time when institutional confidence in Bitcoin continues to rise, fueled by the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs, a growing list of corporate adopters , and renewed global interest in decentralized assets amid monetary policy uncertainty. Bitcoin is currently trading around $105,000, making BitMine’s average entry price relatively close to market. BitMine’s Bitcoin allocation strategy mirrors the broader corporate shift toward hard assets amid inflationary concerns and currency debasement. It also reflects the company's intent to treat Bitcoin not merely as a speculative asset, but as a strategic treasury reserve and operational foundation. As with all crypto-facing companies, BitMine has acknowledged the risks in its forward-looking statements. These include the volatility of Bitcoin, regulatory developments, and the company’s ability to adapt to a fast-evolving technology and financial landscape. Investors are reminded that future performance could vary based on a wide array of factors, including competition, energy pricing, the global economic climate, and the evolving valuation of Bitcoin itself. The company filed its latest Form 10-K with the SEC on April 3, 2025, and notes that all forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and disclosures outlined in those filings. Strategy Inc. Nears 600,000 Bitcoin as It Converts $1B in Preferred Stock Sales into Massive BTC Purchase In related news, corporate Bitcoin treasury firm Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR) has acquired approximately 10,000 additional bitcoins for $1 billion, bringing its total holdings to a staggering 592,100 BTC—just shy of the 600,000 BTC milestone. This monumental purchase cements Strategy’s dominance as the largest publicly traded holder of Bitcoin and underscores its long-term conviction in the digital asset as a superior treasury reserve. The company’s relentless Bitcoin accumulation has drawn widespread attention from both institutional investors and regulatory observers alike. Top 10 largest corporate Bitcoin holders (Source: BitcoinTreasuries ) The latest acquisition was primarily funded by the $1 billion upsized IPO of the firm’s newly launched Stride (STRD) perpetual preferred stock, which offers a 10% non-cumulative fixed dividend and is non-convertible. The offering drew strong institutional interest and marks another key pillar in the company’s innovative financing ecosystem. Additional funding for the purchase was sourced from the at-the-market (ATM) sales of two other perpetual preferred stock programs: Strike (STRK) and Strife (STRF). STRK offers an 8% fixed dividend and is convertible, while STRF provides a 10% cumulative dividend and is non-convertible. According to TD Cowen analysts, this structured approach “establishes a channel for future high-yield funds flows into Bitcoin,” providing Strategy with scalable, long-term funding sources that minimize dilution to common shareholders while maximizing Bitcoin exposure. The Bigger Vision: “42/42” and Long-Term Leverage The latest round of buying is part of Strategy’s aggressive and ambitious “42/42” plan, which seeks to raise $84 billion in equity and convertible debt offerings by 2027, all earmarked for Bitcoin acquisitions. The firm, led by Bitcoin evangelist and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, has become synonymous with the institutionalization of Bitcoin. On a recent earnings call, Saylor outlined the firm’s target leverage ratio of 20%–30%, calculated as total debt and preferred stock divided by the market value of Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings. As of now, the firm sits on $63 billion in Bitcoin and $11.6 billion in total liabilities (including preferred shares), which analysts say supports a strong balance sheet. Analysts at TD Cowen remain bullish, reaffirming their “Buy” rating on Strategy stock and setting a $590 price target for MSTR shares. In a note published Tuesday, the bank emphasized the relative safety of Strategy’s junior securities given the firm’s asset base and modest debt load. The perpetual nature of the preferred stock means the capital raised can remain on the balance sheet indefinitely, offering the firm consistent liquidity without the looming burden of debt maturity—making it a highly flexible instrument for Bitcoin acquisition. Strategy’s Role in Institutionalizing Bitcoin Strategy Inc.'s actions are seen as a watershed moment for Bitcoin’s integration into traditional corporate finance. By issuing fixed-income-style securities tied to a Bitcoin accumulation strategy, the firm is effectively creating a new model for capital markets to interface with crypto assets. This model allows yield-hungry investors to access Bitcoin exposure through income-generating instruments, while enabling Strategy to accumulate BTC without shareholder dilution. It also sends a strong message to Wall Street: Bitcoin is not just a hedge or an asset—it's a treasury standard. With this latest purchase, Strategy now holds more Bitcoin than most countries and is rapidly approaching the symbolic 600,000 BTC mark. As the price of Bitcoin continues to climb, the company’s holdings represent a significant portion of the total circulating supply, amplifying its influence in the crypto and financial sectors.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9608/public-firms-turn-to-capital-markets-to-accelerate-bitcoin-accumulation,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

In 1997, Crypto Barn gave us a glimpse into the possibilities of Crypto, and now we’re riding the narrative and reaping the rewards. But that’s not all! Ethereum is on the precipice of something huge, and potentially taking Crypto Barn to new heights! $BARN has the Crypto degens talking, with Apex Syndicate claiming it will be the next $DOGE, and Crypto Goals forecasting it to 1000x in the coming months. Here’s how $BARN is getting ready to take off with ETH! Ethereum jumped 38% in early May $BARN is poised to pump with ETH $BARN grew 7,114.5% in 8 days The ETH chain advantage for meme coins Forecasts show Ethereum, a long-term rival of Bitcoin, could dominate Bitcoin with its recent performance trends, which could bode well for Memecoins. Early May, ETH added a remarkable 38% value—clearly, some sharks were circling. Considering it’s a $280 billion asset, this was impressive! But this bullish wave didn’t just benefit ETH holders, but also signals to Memecoin holders that a potential pump is on the horizon. The advantage of Memecoins is that they have a smaller market cap, which gives them more room to run in a bullish market. While stablecoins like ETH need vast amounts of money to increase by 10%, smaller caps don’t, thus improving the potential profits for coin holders. So, as ETH sees a pump, popular ETH-based Memecoins are poised to follow! Enter $BARN: Why it’s poised to pump If ETH continues on its upward trajectory, which is expected, $BARN is in a prime position to grow with it. If you don’t believe us, it’s written in history! In 1997, the Simpsons quietly hinted at a future driven by crypto with Crypto Barn, a small store for codes in the background of a scene. Cryptocurrency wasn’t even a word then! $BARN has a real narrative and strong community backing it, ticking the boxes needed for success in the volatile crypto market. With the rise of ETH, this low-cap runner is poised to follow. $BARN forecast – how far can this go? $BARN has huge potential because it is small, or as Apex Syndicate says, “a micro-cap memecoin with great community backing”! It has a current market cap of under $350k, after a pullback from all-time highs following market uncertainty. To give you an idea of how $BARN has grown, by the end of May, it settled around $40k market cap, growing tremendously by the 4th of June to over $1 million! That’s a 7,114.5% increase in just 8 days. Influencers like Apex and Crypto Goals believe it will exceed this, even rivalling $DOGE! You don’t want to miss out on $BARN’s next run!

This trend signals a strategic shift in smart money away from Bitcoin and toward higher-growth projects. Historical trends point to a breakout altseason as funds rotate out of Bitcoin into more agile projects. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) is combining Bitcoin’s unmatched security with the speed and scalability of Solana through its PEP-20 token standard, enabling meme coin infrastructure directly on Bitcoin. With over $14.6m already raised from whales, BPEP is gaining rapid momentum. After nearly four months of correction, bullish momentum has reignited in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin shattering all historical benchmarks. BTC is trading firmly above $105,000, a significant support level after setting a fresh all-time high of $112,000 in May. What sets this cycle apart is the strategic redirection of institutional capital into altcoins. Ethereum ETFs have had their 18th consecutive net inflow day , a streak that began mid-May. However, the volatility in Bitcoin ETFs has disturbed the inflow. Also, while Bitcoin has surged 48% from its April low, Ethereum has posted a higher ROI in the same time period. This shows that the professional money is already starting to rotate to altcoins. Image Courtesy: TradingView Historical trends also suggest that the altcoin season is close. Currently, Bitcoin dominance is hovering around 64% . This mirrors what happened in 2017, when Bitcoin’s dominance hit around 60%, and altcoins exploded shortly after. As this capital rotation accelerates, astute investors are increasing their exposure in projects positioned to reap the benefits. Projects like Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) are poised to use this mass altcoin rotation. Bitcoin Pepe has already raised $14.6m to build Bitcoin’s first meme playground, and they’re coming with an announcement on June 30 for their blockbuster multi-exchange listing. In altcoin bull rallies, projects with strong utility and innovative infrastructure tend to yield higher returns. Three projects stand out in this context: Best cryptos to buy now ahead of altseason breakout. Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) As altcoin season builds momentum and market optimism grows, Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) is gaining massive traction through its ongoing token presale. With a major announcement coming out on June 30, investors have a limited window to join early before the token launches. Bitcoin Pepe is merging two powerful forces: increasing Bitcoin adoption and the explosive profit potential of meme coins. The project is a layer-2 solution built directly on Bitcoin to utilize its $2 trillion dormant capital across various sectors. Bitcoin has gained both popularity and the trust of investors, but its applications are still limited due to its slow speed and scalability. Bitcoin Pepe, with its revolutionary PEP-20 token standard, is addressing this problem. The platform is bringing what some have referred to as “Solana on Bitcoin.” So, now investors can enjoy the unmatched security of the BTC network with the speed and functionality of Solana. Bitcoin Pepe will enable the launch of meme coins on the Bitcoin network, and according to experts, this could be a hundred-billion-dollar market in itself. The project has already attracted big crypto whales, raising over $14.6m in just a short period. Currently priced at $0.0416, the BPEP token offers early investors a massive opportunity to invest in what could become the next big thing in the crypto market because of the essential infrastructure in the evolving crypto landscape. Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL) is the sixth-biggest cryptocurrency with a market value of $80.59 billion. As profit booking hits the crypto market, the Solana price has witnessed a 3.89% drop in the weekly timeframe. CoinMarketCap data confirms that the Solana price has been consolidating between $140 and $170. The resistance at higher levels has pulled the SOL to $150. $SOL looking good here. Strong bounce from the key $141 support zone. Expecting bullish momentum towards local range high. Gaining $181 opens the door for a big rally towards $262. pic.twitter.com/Ct28pcN16F — Lennaert Snyder (@LennaertSnyder) June 16, 2025 Nevertheless, analysts say that the Solana price could rise to higher levels in the next few weeks. Technical analyst Lennaert Snyder forecasts that the Solana price might see a strong bounce from the current support level to retest the local target of $181. In the medium-term forecast, he says SOL might reach the $241 target. A new record of 2.07 billion addresses has been added to the Solana network, according to other news. The number of addresses has been steadily rising despite the market’s fluctuations in Solana prices, which means investors are optimistic about a Solana price uptick. Dogecoin (DOGE) Like other major cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin (DOGE) ranks among the most popular crypto projects. However, its origin sets it apart. While Bitcoin and Ethereum started with serious goals, Dogecoin began as a meme or joke. Despite this lighthearted start, it quickly gained value and built a strong following among crypto enthusiasts. Image Courtesy: TradingView However, due to broader market uncertainty, Dogecoin has experienced considerable intraday swings in the past few days. After a 2.4% decline today, the DOGE price is currently $0.17. The MACD oscillator indicates increasing bullish pressure for Dogecoin. The RSI stands at 38, which shows the dominance of bears in the meme coin. If bulls take control and push the DOGE price above the immediate resistance at $0.21, it may trigger a trend reversal. Subsequently, a breakout from the upper trendline of the wedge pattern could spark another surge in the DOGE price. On the other hand, if the $0.17 support fails, Dogecoin could plunge to $0.15. Hottest altseason gem for 2025 As the altcoin season gains momentum, astute investors have started their hunt for the next mega winner. Whale support and economic tailwinds are shifting, and most importantly, projects with strong utility are gaining the most traction. Investors looking for strong prospects are picking up Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) for its attractive infrastructure, which is transforming how Bitcoin can be used beyond simple transactions. The project’s strong real-world application has attracted a phenomenal $14.6m.

2025-06-18T11:26:47,"Bitcoin (BTC) Could Reach $205K in 2025 if Historic Growth Cycle Holds","Macroeconomic uncertainty gripped markets after US President Donald Trump threatened Iran’s supreme leader, which caused Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to drop in response. Despite this, BTC may be on track for significant gains in 2025 if it follows its long-established yearly performance pattern, according to new analysis of long-term price cycles. BTC on Track for 120% Gain in 2025? Data shows that since 2011, Bitcoin has followed a recurring four-year rhythm – three years of upward growth followed by one year of consolidation – mirroring the cryptocurrency’s halving cycle. With 2023 and 2024 already closing as positive years, 2025 would represent the third and typically strongest year in the cycle. If this historical trend continues, BTC’s price could rise by roughly 120% by the end of 2025, according to the latest analysis by CryptoQuant. Starting from a base of $93,226, that would take the leading cryptocurrency to around $205,097, which could potentially mark the cycle’s peak. The analysis stated that Bitcoin is now in the final bullish phase of its current cycle, which may have important implications for investor strategy and timing. The latest prediction stands in contrast to the often short-term focus of on-chain metrics like MVRV ratios, UTXO bands, and SOPR readings, which, while valuable, can miss the broader structural forces shaping price action, CryptoQuant’s analysis explained. Meanwhile, the long-term view is further supported by Realized Cap data, which continues to print new all-time highs this year, indicating steady market strength. “Bitcoin adheres to a structural rhythm that repeats with striking consistency: three years of expansion followed by one of compression. This long-term lens helps investors stay grounded during short-term volatility and align better with Bitcoin’s historical performance.” Strong Institutional Interest in Bitcoin This long-term optimism is mirrored in institutional behavior, with continued capital inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs despite the broader market pullback. Data from SoSoValue revealed that these funds recorded $216 million in net inflows on June 17th, which marked seven straight days of inflows. Interestingly, more than $1.46 billion was added over the last five trading sessions.

The former Binance CEO and crypto pioneer says fundraising is blockchain’s true “killer app.” He shared this in a recent post on X, responding to SaharaAI’s massive $75 million, and that’s stirred plenty of buzz across the crypto space. As the U.S. government leans more pro-crypto and the market shows signs of revival, CZ’s comment feels timely. And from his latest ventures to Binance’s current path under CEO Richard Teng, CZ’s influence on the industry is far from over. SaharaAI’s Big Win: Blockchain’s Fundraising Potential CZ made his comment after @buidlpad highlighted SaharaAI’s fundraising numbers – $16 million in BNB and $59 million in USD1, a USD-pegged stablecoin built on BNB Chain and linked to Trump-aligned World Liberty Financial. The raise beat expectations by a staggering 777%.

CZ replied to the post, though he later deleted his comment. Still, the message landed: blockchain is proving its strength in areas like capital raising, not just payments or transactions. From Binance to Giggle Academy: CZ’s Next Mission Since stepping down from Binance, CZ has shifted focus toward education. He launched Giggle Academy , a free online learning platform offering math, English, and blockchain courses to underserved kids in developing countries. While serving a four-month prison sentence in 2024 over charges from the DOJ and SEC, CZ also began writing a book. It combines his personal story, the early days of blockchain, and how Binance came to be. The manuscript is still in the works and is expected to give readers a deeper look into the world he helped build. Richard Teng Backs Bitcoin’s Role in the Future Binance’s current CEO, Richard Teng, is also confident in crypto’s future, especially Bitcoin’s. He recently called it the flagship crypto and a “resilient store of value” in times of economic uncertainty. Teng believes that with growing institutional interest and friendlier U.S. policies, Bitcoin will keep rising in importance, acting as digital gold in diversified portfolios and playing a larger role in global finance. The Bigger Picture With Changpeng Zhao’s fundraising announcement and Teng’s Bitcoin predictions, a new chapter is growing in the crypto world. SaharaAI’s success showcases blockchain’s power, while CZ’s efforts in education and writing will keep his legacy alive. The crypto community is watching closely, waiting to see what’s next in CZ’s story.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/cz-declares-fundraising-as-blockchains-killer-app-after-saharaais-75m-win/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|BNB","News",cryptocompare

The company initially targeted £2.5 million but had to quickly expand due to high demand. The offer was ultimately expanded to £4 million (approx. $5.4 million) after it was oversubscribed by as much as 400%. Coinsilium Group Limited (AQUIS: $COIN – OTCQB: $CINGF ), the Web3 investor, advisor, and venture builder, is pleased to confirm the result of its retail offer via the Winterflood Retail Access Platform (“WRAP Retail Offer”), at 6 pence per share (“Issue Price”). The Company has… pic.twitter.com/NtrMpNufhT — Coinsilium (@CoinsiliumGroup) June 2, 2025 Coinsilium goes big on Bitcoin accumulation The UK-based company raised £4 million by issuing 18,018,018 new ordinary shares that are expected to be admitted to trading on the Aquis Growth Market around June 23, 2025. After admission, Coinsilium will have 359,477,274 ordinary shares, each with one voting right. However, there will be no shares held in its treasury. The new shares are expected to be on the same level as existing shares and free of any hindrances. However, not all investors were allowed to participate. According to the document released by Coinslium, the offer was not available in the US, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, South Africa, or EEA member states due to legal restrictions. It also highlighted Peterhouse Capital Limited as the Aquis Stock Exchange Growth Market corporate adviser, and Winterflood Securities Ltd as the manager of the WRAP platform. While the announcement includes forward-looking statements, it does not offer any assurances on actual results. As such, any investor interested should be aware that share value and income are not guaranteed and may fluctuate. Coinsilium entered BTC with £1.25 million raise in May The recently concluded retail offer from Coinsilium comes after the company raised £1.25 million earlier on May 15, 2025, to initiate its Bitcoin strategy. The newly raised funds will support the Bitcoin treasury strategy via its subsidiary, Forza Gibraltar Limited. According to recent reports, the subsidiary has been actively accumulating Bitcoin , and as of June 16, reportedly holds 25.2 Bitcoins in its treasury, including a recent purchase of 6.5577 Bitcoins at an average price of £77,770 ($105,572.30). Coinsilium’s subsidiary, Forza Gibraltar Limited, reports it holds 25.2 Bitcoins in its treasury as of June 16. Source: Forza Bitcoin The total value of holdings now sits at around £1,519,242.90 ($2,054,113.50). In response to the Bitcoin treasury update and WRAP retail offer announcement, Coinsilium’s share price shot up by 91% on June 16, with record trading volume of over 29 million shares on Aquis and 6 million on the US OTC market (CINGF). The trading activity is proof that investors, particularly among retail investors in the UK, are excited about the opportunity to get exposed to Bitcoin, specifically via Coinsilium’s offering. While Coinsilium has become one of the latest companies to transition into a Bitcoin-focused treasury operator, it is not the only one. The success of its retail offer also shows that UK-listed firms can realistically consider adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset with great success. Aside from Coinsilium, other companies that have also opted to adopt similar strategies include The Smarter Web Company, which raised £29 million via the WRAP platform and Helium Ventures.

2025-06-18T11:15:00,"Crypto Daybook Americas: Bitcoin Holds the Line as Trump Labels Iran Leader ‘Easy Target’","By Francisco Rodrigues (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin (BTC) is hovering a smidgen under $105,000 having dropped just 1.4% in the past 24 hours as crypto markets balanced the Israel-Iran war with regulatory progress in the U.S. Tensions in the Middle East are heightening after President Donald Trump called for Iran’s “unconditional surrender” after saying the country’s leader was an “easy target.” Corporate bitcoin buying, however, is underpinning demand, and Senate approval of U.S. stablecoin legislation is seen as a win for the industry . Trump's words helped raise the perceived odds of the U.S. entering the conflict to 62% on prediction market Polymarket , up from around 50% a day ago . The perceived odds of U.S. military action against Iran before August are at 73%. “Despite escalating tensions in the Middle East, BTC is yet to show signs of full-blown panic,” analysts at crypto hedge fund QCP Capital wrote . “BTC’s resilient price action appears underpinned by continued institutional accumulation.” That accumulation is partly driven by corporate bitcoin treasuries. Strategy, for one, has added over 10,000 BTC with funds from the STRD preferred stock offering, and The Blockchain Group said it added 182 BTC this week. Bitcoin rewards firm Fold has secured a $250 million facility to spend on bitcoin, while Mercury Fintech is planning on raising $800 million for a bitcoin treasury. “The market seems to have rediscovered its footing, particularly after BTC held above the key psychological threshold of $100k despite the initial shock,” QCP’s analysts said. “Crucially, Friday’s modest 3% pullback paled in comparison to April last year, when BTC fell more than 8% amid similar Iran-Israel turmoil.” Deribit’s BTC Volatility Index ( DVOL ) is currently around 40.86, down from over 62 in early April. The Senate's approval of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, the first major piece of crypto legislation to clear the chamber, sends a clear message: U.S. lawmakers are increasingly open to formalizing rules for the industry. Markets interpreted the move as a structural win. Traders will be watching today’s interest-rate decision from the Federal Reserve for any surprises. According to the CME’s FedWatch tool, markets are nearly certain rates are going to remain unchanged. That amplifies any fallout from the Iran-Israel conflict, which has now entered the crypto space. The Iranian crypto exchange Nobitex was hacked by a group thought to be linked to Israel just a day after the same group targeted the state-owned Bank Sepah. And in the wider sphere, Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial shipping lane, or the U.S. intervening would likely lead to a risk asset sell-off. “It’s wise to reserve judgement until the U.S. open, where most price discovery has been occurring,” said Jake O., an OTC trader at Wintermute.

INK will be airdropped to early users, with the foundation pledging measures to limit airdrop farming and maintain long-term alignment. The token has a fixed cap of 1 billion and won’t be subject to governance changes or emission tweaks — a move to avoid common dilution concerns. Governance of the Ink layer 2 remains separate from the INK token, differentiating it from other Superchain projects that often intertwine protocol and token governance. The first utility will be a native liquidity protocol for lending and trading, serving as a foundational DeFi building block on the Ink chain. INK will debut amid weak market conditions, with most 2024–25 L2 token launches underperforming as the hype subsides. Examples include Celestia, Linea, and Blast. Ink’s DeFi activity remains minimal, with just $7 million in TVL and under $100 in daily revenue — raising questions about product-market fit despite its ""product-first"" narrative. Derivatives Positioning Perpetual funding rates for major coins are barely positive, indicating a renewed caution among traders.

2025-06-18T11:12:10,"TRX slips 6% as Iran’s Nobitex suffers $80M hack on Tron Network","The Iran-Israel war has landed on the cryptocurrency industry. Iran’s top crypto exchange, Nobitex, has suffered a massive exploit on the Tron blockchain , losing assets worth over $80 million. Most notably, Israel’s hacking group revealed that they breached the trading platform with a bold statement reading: We, “Gonjeshke Darande,” conducted cyberattacks against Nobitex. On-chain investigator ZachXBT unveiled the news via Telegram on Wednesday, revealing that the attacker drained millions in digital assets across Tron, Dogecoin, Bitcoin, and various EVM-compatible protocols. The involved digital tokens plunged following the revelation, but Tron’s TRX seemed to suffer the most. TRX trades at $0.272 after losing 6.50% in the past 24 hours, and the reducing trading volume suggests continued struggles in the near –term. Meanwhile, the nature of the transactions has grabbed attention. Apart from draining the funds, the attacker capitalized on the incident to send a harsh message using customized wallets. They moved the stolen assets into vanity addresses with offensive tags, including: Tron – TKFuckiRGCTerroristsNoBiTEXy2r7mNX Bitcoin – 1FuckGCTerroristsNoBiTEXXXaAovLX Dogecoin – DFuckiRGCTerroristsNoBiTEXXXWLW65t Ethereum – 0xffFFfFFffFFffFfFffFFfFfFfFFFFfFfFFFFDead These are not random addresses. The attacker deliberately crafted the wallets to incorporate anti-terrorism, anti-Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and anti-Nobitex messages. Experts believe this isn’t a finically driven attack but a planned cyber-psyop. While most crypto fraudsters launder or withdraw stolen assets, Nobitex perpetrators sent the funds to inaccessible or dead wallets, burning the digital assets permanently. ZachXBT stated: The funds were essentially burned permanently and could not be touched unless stablecoin issuers were to reissue the centralized stablecoins. Destroying the assets without monetary gains reflects the ideological or political motive behind the Nobitex hack. Israel hackers claim responsibility Forget about bounties and white hat deals. Gonjeshke Darande, an Israel hacker group, claims to be behind Nobitex’s attack. The event comes amid the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel , which has entered the fifth day of escalation. The group stated: These cyberattacks are the result of Nobitex being a key regime tool for financing terrorism and violating sanctions. Associating with regime terror financing and sanction violation infrastructure puts your assets at risk.

Meanwhile, the incident has deteriorated sentiments across the blockchain, explaining TRX’s massive slump on its daily price chart. The digital token hovers at $0.2736 after losing more than 6% in the past 24 hours. The daily trading volume has plummeted by nearly 60%, signaling waning interest in TRX. Enthusiasts can anticipate further Tron dips as the markets digest Nobitex’s hacking incident. Losing the 0.2647 barrier could trigger continued dips to early May lows of $0.2437.

2025-06-18T11:10:39,"The Blockchain Group boosts BTC reserves to over $170M after fresh bond funding","Paris-listed technology firm The Blockchain Group has increased its Bitcoin holdings by acquiring an additional 182 BTC for approximately $19.6 million, bringing its total reserves to 1,653 BTC. At current market prices, the company’s Bitcoin stash is valued at over $170 million. The latest purchase, completed on 17 June, follows a wider trend of public firms using their balance sheets to hold digital assets. This move solidifies The Blockchain Group’s status as Europe’s first Bitcoin treasury company. The acquisition was funded through a series of convertible bond issuances completed earlier this month, raising nearly €18 million ($20.7 million) . The company confirmed in an announcement that several institutional investors, including UTXO Management, Moonlight Capital, TOBAM, and Ludovic Chechin-Laurans, participated in the financing round, each contributing to different parts of the bond issuance. Bond issuance and custody are handled by key institutions The execution of the Bitcoin purchases was carried out by Banque Delubac & Cie and Swissquote Bank Europe SA. Custody of the newly acquired assets is managed by Taurus, a Switzerland-based infrastructure provider for digital assets. The use of these institutions underscores the company’s intent to combine traditional financial mechanisms with digital asset strategies. In parallel, The Blockchain Group is actively pursuing larger ambitions to expand its crypto treasury. Earlier in June, it announced plans to raise up to €300 million ($342 million) through an “At the Market” (ATM) offering. The shares will be sold in tranches at market-driven prices, based either on the previous day’s close or the volume-weighted average price, with a cap at 21% of the stock’s daily trading volume. Bitcoin performance boosts treasury yield in 2025 The firm’s investment in Bitcoin has resulted in a reported year-to-date yield of 1,173.2% in 2025. This reflects a sharp increase in the ratio of Bitcoin held to the company’s fully diluted share count. Since January, The Blockchain Group has acquired 469 BTC and registered over $49.4 million in Bitcoin value gains. Its average acquisition price across all holdings is currently about $103,000 per BTC, below the market rate. With plans underway to acquire an additional 70 BTC, the company’s holdings could soon reach 1,723 BTC. Shares of The Blockchain Group, which trades under the ticker ALTBG on Euronext Growth Paris, fell 0.70% at the last close, according to Google Finance . Firms rush to add Bitcoin as caution grows The Blockchain Group is part of a broader wave of firms increasing their Bitcoin exposure. According to BitcoinTreasuries.NET, at least 26 entities have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets over the past month alone. This sharp increase in adoption has prompted both optimism and concern within the financial sector. While some firms are seen as making strategic treasury decisions, others may be using Bitcoin as a fallback amid deteriorating fundamentals. Industry watchers, including Fakhul Miah from GoMining Institutional, caution that smaller firms copying this playbook may lack sufficient risk management frameworks. Adding to the warnings, Standard Chartered Bank has issued a note predicting that up to half of these companies could face significant challenges if Bitcoin’s price drops below $90,000. A slide beneath that level could trigger widespread liquidations, damaging not only individual firms but also Bitcoin’s broader perception as a corporate treasury asset.

2025-06-18T11:10:32,"South Korean Companies Accelerate Bitcoin Holdings Amid Remarkable Crypto Adoption","BitcoinWorld South Korean Companies Accelerate Bitcoin Holdings Amid Remarkable Crypto Adoption Hey crypto enthusiasts and market watchers! Have you been keeping an eye on the corporate world’s embrace of Bitcoin? It seems the trend isn’t slowing down, and this time, the spotlight is on South Korea. According to a report from Munhwa Ilbo, South Korean companies Bitcoin holdings are on the rise, signaling growing confidence in the digital asset space. This isn’t just a few startups dabbling; publicly listed firms are actively adding BTC to their balance sheets. This move is happening against a backdrop of increasing global optimism surrounding crypto adoption and even reports about the U.S. government considering strategic crypto reserves. It’s a fascinating development that suggests Bitcoin is becoming a more mainstream asset class, even for traditional businesses. Who’s Leading the Charge in Corporate Bitcoin Holdings? So, which South Korean companies are diving into the Bitcoin pool? The report highlights that publicly listed firms in the country collectively hold a significant amount of Bitcoin. As of the report, their combined corporate Bitcoin holdings stand at approximately 679.34 BTC. To put that into perspective, that’s valued at around 98.9 billion won, which translates to roughly $72 million at current market rates. It’s interesting to see the variety of companies involved, spanning different sectors. This isn’t just limited to crypto-native businesses. Let’s break down some of the major players mentioned and their reported holdings: Company Industry Reported BTC Holdings Bitmax Crypto Exchange 251 BTC Wemade Blockchain Gaming 223 BTC Neowiz Online Game Development 123 BTC Kakao Messaging/Tech Giant 39 BTC Celltrion Biopharmaceutical 18.05 BTC Danal Payment Solutions 17 BTC Netmarble Mobile Game Development 8.29 BTC As you can see, while crypto exchanges like Bitmax naturally hold significant amounts, companies from gaming (Wemade, Neowiz, Netmarble), tech (Kakao), biopharma (Celltrion), and payments (Danal) are also getting involved. This diverse participation underscores the growing recognition of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset across various industries. Why the Rush for Bitcoin Accumulation by South Korean Firms? What’s motivating these companies to increase their Bitcoin accumulation right now? The Munhwa Ilbo report points to a couple of key factors: Rising Expectations for Global Crypto Adoption: This is a major driver. As cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, gain wider acceptance among institutions, retail investors, and even governments, companies see the potential for future growth and legitimacy. Holding Bitcoin can be seen as an investment in a rapidly evolving digital economy. U.S. Government’s Strategic Crypto Reserves Plan: The mere discussion of a major global power like the U.S. considering holding crypto reserves adds significant weight to Bitcoin’s status. It suggests a future where digital assets play a role in national financial strategies, making corporate holdings seem less speculative and more strategic. Beyond these specific points, other potential reasons align with global corporate treasury strategies: Inflation Hedging: In an uncertain economic climate, some companies view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin can help diversify a company’s treasury holdings away from traditional assets. Belief in Bitcoin’s Long-Term Value: Companies may genuinely believe in Bitcoin’s potential for significant appreciation over the long term due to its fixed supply and increasing network effects. Following the Trend: With companies like MicroStrategy famously leading the charge, others might feel pressure or see the potential benefits of following suit to stay competitive or attractive to investors interested in the digital asset space. The Broader Impact: How Does This Reflect Global Crypto Adoption? The actions of these South Korean companies Bitcoin buyers are not isolated incidents. They are part of a larger global trend of increasing institutional and corporate interest in cryptocurrencies. This corporate embrace is a significant indicator of growing crypto adoption worldwide. Here’s why this matters for the broader crypto ecosystem: Increased Legitimacy: When established, publicly traded companies hold Bitcoin, it lends credibility to the asset class. It moves Bitcoin further away from being seen purely as a speculative tool and closer to a recognized store of value or digital reserve asset. Market Impact: Corporate buying can represent substantial capital inflows into the market, potentially influencing demand and price dynamics, especially as more companies join in. Setting a Precedent: As these companies gain experience and potentially see positive results from their Bitcoin holdings, it could encourage other firms in South Korea and globally to explore similar strategies. This trend aligns with developments like the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in various regions and the increasing integration of blockchain technology into existing business models. It suggests that the digital transformation of finance and assets is well underway, with companies actively positioning themselves within it. Navigating the Crypto Waters: Challenges for Companies Holding Bitcoin While the potential benefits are clear, it’s also important to acknowledge the challenges that South Korean companies Bitcoin holders face. Holding a volatile asset like Bitcoin on a corporate balance sheet comes with its own set of considerations: Volatility Risk: Bitcoin’s price is known for its significant swings. This volatility can impact a company’s balance sheet and earnings reports, potentially leading to impairment charges during downturns. Regulatory Uncertainty: While South Korea has a developed crypto market, the regulatory landscape for corporate crypto holdings can still be complex and subject to change. Companies need to navigate evolving rules around accounting, taxation, and compliance. Accounting and Reporting: Accounting for Bitcoin holdings can be tricky. Under current rules in many jurisdictions, Bitcoin is often treated as an intangible asset, which can require impairment testing and impact financial statements differently than traditional assets. Security: Safely storing significant amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to protect against hacking, theft, or loss of private keys. Shareholder Perception: Not all shareholders may be comfortable with a company holding volatile cryptocurrencies, potentially leading to scrutiny or pressure. These challenges require careful consideration, risk management, and clear communication with stakeholders. The fact that companies are still proceeding suggests they believe the potential rewards outweigh these risks, or they have developed strategies to mitigate them. What Does This Mean for the Future of South Korea Crypto and Beyond? The increasing Bitcoin accumulation by prominent South Korean companies is a strong signal for the future of the South Korea crypto market and the global landscape. It indicates a maturation of the asset class and a growing willingness among established businesses to participate. We might see: More South Korean companies announcing Bitcoin or other crypto holdings. Increased demand for services related to corporate crypto treasury management, custody, and compliance within South Korea. South Korea potentially becoming a more significant player in the global corporate crypto adoption trend. Further evolution of South Korea’s regulatory framework to accommodate corporate crypto activities. This trend reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is transitioning from a fringe asset to a strategic consideration for corporate treasuries worldwide. While the amounts held by South Korean firms are currently modest compared to global leaders like MicroStrategy, the participation of diverse, publicly listed companies is a powerful endorsement. Summary: South Korean Companies Embrace Bitcoin In conclusion, the report highlighting increased South Korean companies Bitcoin holdings is a significant development. It underscores the growing confidence in cryptocurrencies driven by factors like rising global crypto adoption and potential governmental interest in digital assets. The diverse range of companies involved, from gaming to biopharma, signals a broader acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. While challenges like volatility and regulation remain, the trend of corporate Bitcoin holdings and Bitcoin accumulation in South Korea points towards a future where digital assets play a more integrated role in corporate finance, contributing to the ongoing evolution of the South Korea crypto market and the global digital economy.

2025-06-18T11:03:19,"Where is Bitcoin Pepe headed as geopolitical tensions continue to weigh on sentiments?","Bitcoin recovered from lows on Wednesday as the US President Donald Trump warned Iran that the US’s patience is running out , and called for Iran’s unconditional surrender. Bitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies, fell after the news of the intensifying conflict between Israel and Iran, and since then has staged a slight recovery. As cryptocurrencies stage a comeback, upcoming tokens like Bitcoin Pepe continue to see strength in their presale. The token’s presale received $300,000 worth of investment after it made a listing announcement. US increases pressure on Iran Bitcoin fell below the $104,000 level after Donald Trump, in a Truth Social post, made remarks against Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Trump said, “We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there — We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now”. Trump added that they don’t want to shoot missiles at civilians or American soldiers and called for the unconditional surrender of Iran. After Trump’s post, Bitcoin fell from $104,310 to $103,553. The leading cryptocurrency recovered from that level to trade at $105,152.64 at the time of writing, according to CoinMarketCap. Ethereum slipped 1.3% to $2,462, and XRP was down 1.3% to $2.14 in the same period when Bitcoin fell. Both Ethereum and XRP recovered to $2,537.06 and $2.15 at the time of writing. The Crypto Fear and Greed index also fell to 48 in neutral territory from 53 yesterday. The market is expecting crypto to have a strong movement after the war tensions are over. Bitcoin Pepe presale shows no sign of slowing Bitcoin Pepe, a layer 2 solution built on Bitcoin, aims to bring the meme experience to Bitcoin’s network. The token combines the best of worlds as it combines the security of Bitcoin with Solana’s scalability. The project’s PEP 20 token standard will allow anyone to create memes on Bitcoin. Bitcoin Pepe has raised close to $15 million so far in its presale. The investors also look forward to a listing announcement on June 30. Bitcoin Pepe is also expected to be listed on major exchanges like MEXC and Bitmart, which will add liquidity and legitimacy for the token. As the listing announcement nears, more T1 exchanges are expected to be onboard, increasing the chances of a bumper listing. This could provide more upside for the token’s investors. All the Bitcoin Pepe tokens that have been bought till now will also receive a 30% retroactive bonus, adding more to the returns.

In a 13-page lengthy letter to CFTC Inspector General Christopher Skinner, Gemini attributes blame to the agency’s enforcement arm for pursuing a “lawfare” campaign that has its genesis in personal ambition rather than justice. Dispute Dates Back to 2017 The dispute centers on a 2022 CFTC complaint alleging Gemini made false claims about its 2017 Bitcoin auction process. The case settled for $5 million. But Gemini says the allegations were built on dishonest testimony by an angry former employee who was disgruntled with the firm, whom Gemini alleges lied under oath and then committed fraud. It did not matter that Gemini Trust was the actual victim,” the letter complains, blaming the enforcement team for spending taxpayers’ money to fulfill personal agendas. Claims of Overregulation The enforcement department strayed from its mission to protect markets and instead targeted the exchange with no proof of harm or ill, Gemini alleges. The letter asks for inside accountability and adds to calls for reform by current Commissioner Caroline Pham. CFTC Leadership Drives Reform Regulatory reform champion Caroline Pham has led an open and forward-thinking approach since assuming office. Pham has promoted industry dialogue, balanced regulation, and strict implementation of the law by both regulators and market participants.

2025-06-18T11:00:52,"Ethereum Whale Frenzy: Big-Money Buying Hits Scale Unseen Since 2017","On-chain data shows Ethereum whales have recently ramped up their accumulation, a sign that could be bullish for the asset’s price. Ethereum Whales Have Been Buying Big According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode , the Ethereum whales have been participating in a very significant amount of accumulation during the past week. ‘ Whales ‘ refer to the the ETH investors holding between 1,000 and 10,000 tokens of the cryptocurrency. At the current exchange this range converts to about $2.5 million at the lower end and $25 million at the upper one. While this range doesn’t cover the absolute top end of the market, it still includes humongous investors who may be considered a key part of the ecosystem. As such, considering this role, the movements related to these holders could be worth monitoring. One way to watch the behavior of the whales is through the total amount of the Ethereum supply held by them. Below is the chart shared by Glassnode that shows the trend in this metric over the past few months. As is visible in the graph, the supply of the Ethereum whales has recently shot up, a sign that big-money investors have been accumulating the cryptocurrency. “For nearly a week, daily whale accumulation has exceeded 800K ETH, pushing holdings in 1k–10k wallets to >14.3M ETH,” notes the analytics firm. From the chart, it’s apparent that a particularly large spike occurred on June 12th. On this date, the ETH whales added more than 871,000 ETH to their holdings, the highest daily inflow for the cohort year-to-date. The latest accumulation spree isn’t just notable in terms of the year, but rather also impressive in a historical context. “This scale of buying hasn’t been seen since 2017,” says Glassnode. Naturally, the extraordinary buying push from these investors could be a potential indication that they are confident about the future of the coin. While this strong accumulation activity has been spotted on-chain, another side of the sector has also seen demand: the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) . The spot ETFs are investment vehicles that provide a way for investors to get exposure to Ethereum without directly owning the asset.

2025-06-18T11:00:00,"As Bitcoin Holds a Safe Range, Lightchain AI Enters Risk-On Watchlists With Heavy Social Traction","As Bitcoin holds a relatively safe and stable trading range, risk-on sentiment is quietly shifting toward emerging projects—and Lightchain AI is quickly entering top watchlists. With its 15-stage presale complete and the Bonus Round now live, the platform is gaining heavy social traction across forums and crypto communities. What sets it apart is its AI-native infrastructure, including a purpose-built virtual machine and a consensus mechanism that rewards real computational value. As the July 2025 mainnet launch approaches, traders looking for the next big mover are watching closely. While Bitcoin plays defense, Lightchain AI is becoming the focus of more aggressive positioning. Bitcoin Maintains Stability Within Narrow Trading Band As of May 27, 2025 Bitcoin is exchanging hands at around $109,808 and has been mostly steady within the $108,000-$110,000 range. The consolidation that follows the latest all-time high of almost $112,000 had come amid optimism for positive regulatory news and growing institutional adoption. While the trend has plateaued, institutional interest continues to be strong. Most notably, MicroStrategy added a further $427 million to its Bitcoin position, while spot Bitcoin ETFs also recorded significant inflows, rising to a record of $8.36 billion in April. Technical indicators are also overbought, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) around 72, which could result in some short term consolidation. Forward, market players will be watching for data in coming days such as the U.S. PCE index to see how it might impact the Fed’s policy and how that might affect risk assets. Bitcoin’s Recent Price Action Suggests Consolidation, Fundamentals Will Determine Its Next Big Move Although Bitcoin has seen some volatility in recent weeks, the benchmark cryptocurrency has not been able to make any notable fluctuations One trader is now noting that the crypto is stuck within a relatively tight range and its next big movement will be influenced by market fundamentals and macroeconomic trends. Lightchain AI Gains Attention Across Risk-On Trader Communities Lightchain AI is drawing strong attention across risk-on trader communities, with speculators targeting its Bonus Round at the fixed $0.007 price. These traders aren’t just chasing momentum—they’re reacting to real infrastructure behind the token. A $150,000 grant pool has been deployed to support the development of dApps, data oracles, APIs, SDKs, and ecosystem tools, signaling clear builder incentives. What adds to Lightchain’s appeal is its parallelized execution model, which distributes AI tasks across decentralized nodes for low-latency, high-throughput performance. This structure ensures the network can scale with demand while keeping computational costs efficient. As word spreads across high-risk, high-reward trading circles, Lightchain AI is becoming a favored pick for those seeking utility-driven upside before launch. Social Buzz Explodes—Lightchain AI Takes Over Watchlists! Lightchain AI is taking social media by storm, igniting passionate debates across crypto communities. Traders are buzzing, and its rapid rise onto countless watchlists proves it’s a force to watch. With bold innovation and a dedicated fanbase, Lightchain AI is shaking up the blockchain world.

2025-06-18T10:57:59,"100,000 TPS and 150% Launch Returns: Why Bitcoin Solaris Is Crushing Solana Price Prediction Models","The post 100,000 TPS and 150% Launch Returns: Why Bitcoin Solaris Is Crushing Solana Price Prediction Models appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Crypto markets in 2025 are no longer buying into branding alone. After years of buzzwords and speculative whitepapers, investors are now watching real-world metrics, tech delivery, and access. Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is emerging as the altcoin that checks every box: high throughput, minimal entry barriers, and tokenomics that work in reality. The project’s eighth presale phase is currently open at $8 per token, with over 11,500 participants contributing more than $4.5 million so far. And as the exchange listing benchmark nears $20, early buyers stand to gain 150% just on launch pricing alone — before market growth even begins. Solana’s Ceiling Becomes Bitcoin Solaris’s Floor Solana rose on the promise of speed and scalability. It delivered—but also ran into network congestion, hardware reliance, and centralized validator criticism. Bitcoin Solaris takes a different route. Its dual-layer chain includes a hybrid Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Capacity base layer, combined with a Solaris Layer running Proof-of-History and Proof-of-Time. The result? A network that handles over 100,000 transactions per second with two-second confirmation times. Better yet, the energy consumption is nearly negligible — down 99.95% compared to traditional mining systems. Where Solana requires major hardware and technical setup, BTC-S invites everyday users through mobile-based contribution. It isn’t competing with Solana’s past—it’s building the protocol many expected Solana to become. Audited Infrastructure, Public Team, Live Participation This isn’t a roadmap with deadlines that may never arrive. Bitcoin Solaris has already completed a full smart contract audit via Cyberscope , and the mining logic was independently verified by Freshcoins . The development team also completed KYC verification , giving a rare layer of accountability during the presale phase. The Nova App — now rolling out after successful beta testing — lets users mine from modern smartphones, contributing idle CPU and storage to help validate the chain. There’s no need for validators, staking platforms, or complicated setup. Participation is real, and results are already being measured. BTC-S Supply Strategy: The Hidden Value Trigger Out of a hard-capped 21 million BTC-S tokens, only 4.2 million are designated for presale. That allocation includes all public rounds — there are no backdoor minting mechanisms or developer wallets waiting to unlock. This one-time distribution model mirrors Bitcoin’s early economics, where entry price and contribution, not institutional leverage, shaped outcomes. As each presale phase fills, price and difficulty both increase. With current buyers entering at $8 and exchange benchmarks set around $20, timing isn’t just a preference — it’s an advantage. Analysts Shift Focus to Bitcoin Solaris Prominent crypto analyst Ben Crypto recently spotlighted Bitcoin Solaris in a detailed YouTube breakdown. He emphasized how BTC-S aligns structurally with early Bitcoin, not in branding, but in protocol utility, audit trail, and retail inclusion. The momentum is clear — BTC-S offers upside without relying on narratives alone. Solana’s price has plateaued amid validator concentration and performance inconsistencies. Bitcoin Solaris, meanwhile, has created traction on proof, not promises. Closing Window, Expanding Opportunity As Bitcoin Solaris moves through its final presale stages, the ability to enter below market becomes less about opportunity and more about urgency. Entry at $8 may not carry the return potential of earlier phases, but with 150% still on the table pre-launch — and a live network already in motion — the case remains strong. Bitcoin Solaris represents a challenge to the entire legacy structure of crypto development: a project that launched with function first, transparency second, and wealth-building tools for users, not just insiders.

2025-06-18T10:53:24,"Bitcoin (BTC) Price Could Soon Witness a Strong Jump & Hit $110K—Here’s Why","The post Bitcoin (BTC) Price Could Soon Witness a Strong Jump & Hit $110K—Here’s Why appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is currently trading around $105K, having edged down about 1.4% today after peaking near $106.5K. The recent aftermath of geopolitical tensions, especially in the Middle East, and a cautious macroeconomic outlook have driven mild risk-off sentiment. Yet, technical indicators such as Bollinger Bands expansion and a positive MACD histogram hint at an imminent surge in volatility that could fuel a breakout. Will this, can the BTC price reclaim $108K? Massive Bullish Bitcoin Signal Tether has been mining new tokens very frequently in recent times, which has been heavily contributing to the volatility within the markets. Each time Tether minted a billion tokens, the Bitcoin price witnessed a significant push. The price rebounded from the local bottoms and surged to reach the local highs or even an ATH. The data from Lookonchain suggests Tether has minted another billion, which could be considered a huge bullish signal. In the past few weeks, the BTC price has experienced a significant rise following two Tether-minted USDT. Therefore, now that the USDT has minted one more billion tokens, there is a huge possibility of Bitcoin triggering a strong upswing. The US has just passed the new Stablecoin bill, or the GENIUS Bill, which is expected to shake up Tether’s dominance in the market. With the tighter regulations coming, USDC and the other stablecoins could gain ground. Despite this, the USDT maintains stability at $1, solidifying its position with a $155.58 billion market cap. One of the major reasons behind the stability could be the influx of new USDT tokens into the market. Will the BTC Price Rise Again? Bitcoin price has held strongly above the crucial support at around $102.8K as it has revived a strong rise, soon marking the bottom. Currently, the price is facing a huge compression with the long/short ratio almost 50/50, which opens both the possibility of a breakout and a breakdown. Therefore, a confirmation of any trend could depend on the price deviating either above $107K or dropping below $103K. However, in the wider perspective, the Bitcoin price is at the neckline of a huge bullish structure, and hence, a breakout could propel the token to a new ATH.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-btc-price-could-soon-witness-a-strong-jump-hit-110k-heres-why/,"BTC|MARKET|MINING|TRADING|USDT","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

Today, as FOMC meeting approaches, prior to this meet a staggering $1 billion worth of USDT was minted on Ethereum. This significant influx of cash coming into the world’s largest stablecoin clearly a pivotal moment for Bitcoin, especially if the Federal Reserve decides to cut interest rates. Such a move might elevate the price’s of risky assets, including pumping BTC into a price discovery phase. The news was confirmed via Lookonchain’s official X account, which noted that in the past, similar USDT minting events led to substantial Bitcoin price surges. MisterCrypto pointed out that despite the prevailing bearish sentiment fueled by geopolitical tensions, Bitcoin could potentially soar to $140,000. This has left many investors wondering: can Bitcoin really rise amidst the current panic? Keep reading to know more to this minting event and what it could mean for Bitcoin’s future. Why Bitcoin Price Poised For A Rise? Yesterday, the US posted a fierce teaser to Iran to submit to the US. The Truth Social post starting with “unconditional surrender!” from Donald Trump’s official account is indicative that the Israel-Iran conflict has disturbed the US, and the president intends to stop it. Therefore, combined with the FOMC meeting and potential improvements in geopolitics with Iran surrendering to the US, it will be an ultra-bullish factor for the most-watched crypto sector lately.

NEW: Gemini has filed a scathing complaint against the @CFTC Enforcement Division, accusing it of waging a 7-year campaign of “lawfare” against the crypto exchange. Instead of going after real wrongdoers, Gemini says, the CFTC sued the exchange and relied on testimony from a… pic.twitter.com/ABWKaaH0j9 — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) June 17, 2025 The 13-page complaint , filed on June 13 with Inspector General Christopher Skinner, alleges that enforcement lawyers “ selectively and unfairly weaponized ” federal law to bring “ dubious false statements charges ” against the Winklevoss twins’ exchange. Despite all these, the CTFC never produced evidence of intentional wrongdoing throughout seven years of investigation and discovery. Gemini Paid $5M Settlement to CTFC, Then Came After Falsehood The scathing allegations come just months after Gemini paid a $5 million settlement in January 2025 to resolve a case allegedly stemmed from a “ lie-riddled whistleblower submission by a discredited former employee ” seeking revenge after being terminated for facilitating fraud. GEMINI SETTLES WITH CFTC FOR $5M OVER 2017 BITCOIN FUTURES SCUFFLE So, Gemini’s taking a $5M hit to settle with the CFTC after some shady 2017 claims. The CFTC accused the Winklevoss-led platform of misrepresenting stuff when trying to get their bitcoin futures contract… pic.twitter.com/YS9yhaKudZ — Mario Nawfal’s Roundtable (@RoundtableSpace) January 6, 2025 The complaint names nine specific CFTC enforcement lawyers, including Manal Sultan, K. Brent Tomer, and David Oakland, accusing them of pursuing fabricated claims driven by “ selfish desire to advance their careers ” rather than principled law enforcement. Gemini argues that the entire investigation originated from false allegations made by former Chief Operating Officer Benjamin Small, who was fired in 2017 for his role in a $7.45 million rebate fraud scheme perpetrated by customers Hashtech LLC and Cardano Singapore. A 2022 arbitrator ruling found that Small “ fraudulently procured his employment ,” “ lied repeatedly about his experience ,” and made false statements in his whistleblower submission. Yet, the CFTC continued pursuing Gemini while taking no action against Small, who may now receive a $1.5 million whistleblower award. From Victim to Target: How a Fraud Case Became a Regulatory Nightmare The origins of Gemini’s regulatory ordeal date back to summer 2017, when the exchange fell victim to a sophisticated multi-million dollar rebate fraud orchestrated by two customers working in coordination with Benjamin Small, then the exchange’s Chief Operating Officer. Small was aware of the substantial losses but failed to stop the fraudulent trading and attempted to conceal the scheme from Gemini founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. Upon discovery of the fraud, Small and other complicit employees were immediately terminated for cause, while Gemini successfully sued the perpetrators and recovered all improperly earned rebates totaling 388 bitcoin and $1.7 million. Rather than accepting responsibility for his role in the fraud, Small embarked on what he described as a vindictive campaign to “destroy” Gemini Trust, filing false whistleblower reports with the CFTC in late 2017. His allegations centered on claims that Gemini had omitted material information in statements to regulators regarding the exchange’s bitcoin auction pricing mechanism and its susceptibility to manipulation. The CFTC enforcement division “immediately and unquestioningly embraced” Small’s false claims, launching an investigation in early 2018 with what Gemini describes as a “predetermined outcome” to sue the exchange. Letter from J. Baughman to CFTC Inspector General Source: Eleanor Terrett More damning still, a 2022 JAMS arbitrator rendered a $5 million judgment against Small, delivering a “ scathing decision ” that found he had fraudulently obtained his employment, was terminated for gross negligence, and had lied repeatedly throughout his career. Regulatory Double Standards and Prosecutorial Misconduct Gemini’s complaint reveals disturbing selective enforcement where the CFTC ignored actual criminals while pursuing dubious charges against the exchange. Despite clear evidence of intentional fraud by Hashtech, Cardano, and co-conspirators, enforcement lawyers chose not to prosecute these wrongdoers, instead planning to use testimony from admitted criminals against Gemini. The enforcement division employed abusive litigation tactics, embracing an “ extraordinarily broad view ” of deliberative process privilege to deny Gemini access to potentially exculpatory evidence. This approach created what Acting Chairman Pham has warned against: a situation where defendants are “ presumed guilty with no way to prove innocence .” Crypto exchange Gemini is on the verge of obtaining a license in Malta, while Luxembourg is gearing up to grant a license to Coinbase, according to a report. #Coinbase #Gemini #MiCALicense https://t.co/WRQ1YhAMiG — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 16, 2025 The timing of the complaint proves particularly significant as it coincides with Gemini’s ambitious expansion plans, including a confidentially filed IPO registration with the SEC and reported progress toward securing a Malta license for pan-European operations under new EU crypto regulations.

2025-06-18T10:41:26,"Pro Israel hackers hit Iran's biggest exchange ‘Nobitex’ for $81.7M","Iranian crypto exchange Nobitex announced Wednesday that its technical team had detected signs of unauthorized access to a portion of its reporting infrastructure and hot wallet. The company suspended all access immediately after detecting the breach and said its internal security teams are closely investigating the extent of the incident. According to ZachXBT, the exchange appears to have been exploited for $81.7M on the Tron network, Bitcoin , Doge, and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible blockchains after suspicious outflows were observed from many linked wallets. He also pointed to a Bitcoin address that exploited the protocol, which caused suspicious outflows from multiple Nobitex-linked wallets. Pro-Israel hackers admit to breaching Nobitex 🚨 Iran’s largest crypto exchange, @nobitexmarket , was exploited this morning for $82M via the Tron network, per @zachxbt . Funds were funded to the wallet: https://t.co/rfEfT8t8KL Access was quickly suspended; the site and app are currently down until further notice. pic.twitter.com/ln99UazSwI — Hacken🇺🇦 (@hackenclub) June 18, 2025 Nobitex assured its users that their assets are completely secure according to cold storage standards. The firm noted that the incident only affected some of the assets in hot wallets. The crypto exchange said it accepts full responsibility for the incident and assured users that all damages will be compensated through the insurance fund and Nobitex resources. Nobitex also confirmed that its website and app are temporarily unavailable until a full review is completed. On-chain data from Tronscan identified an address where the first $49 million was stolen. The pro-Israel hacker group Gonjeshke Darande, or “Predatory Sparrow,” claimed responsibility, stating the attack is retaliation for Nobitex’s alleged role in terrorism financing and sanctions evasion. The group also threatened to release Norbitex’s source code and internal information from their internal network in 24 hours. The hacker group argued that Iran’s dependence on Nobitex is evident from the fact that working at the exchange is considered valid military service since it is considered vital to the regime’s efforts. The hackers also warned that associating with regime terror financing and sanction violation infrastructure puts the company’s assets at risk. According to blockchain security firm CertiK, the breach adds to a growing list of crypto industry hacks this year. The company found that over $2.1 billion in digital assets had been exploited in 2025. “The majority of this $2.1 billion was caused by wallet compromises, key mismanagement, and operational issues.” -Ronghui Gu, Co-founder of CertiK. Gu also noted that social engineering scams, such as address poisoning, are now more common than protocol-level hacks. The attacks rely on psychological manipulation to trick users into transferring assets to fraudulent wallets. Pro-Israel hackers breach Bank Sepha Gonjeshke Darande also said Tuesday that it is behind a series of cyberattacks against Iran’s Bank Sepha. The pro-Israel hacking group’s attack would mark the first major cyberattack on critical infrastructure during Israel’s war with Iran. The group argued that the financial institution circumvented international sanctions and used the people of Iran’s money to finance its terrorist proxies, its ballistic missile program, and its military nuclear program. According to local media outlets, Bank Sepha’s customers have reportedly been facing problems with accessing their accounts, making withdrawals, and paying with their cards. Iranian state media also warned that the disruptions could impact the country’s gas stations, which rely on the bank to process transactions. Iran’s central bank spokesperson is also quoted as telling state-run IRNA that all banking operations are running smoothly and providing service to their customers. The bank has not yet commented publicly on the attack, which happened after some people in Tehran evacuated overnight following President Trump’s ominous warning. The pro-Israel group has previously bragged and shared videos of attacks on Iranian steel mills and successfully shut down the country’s railway system, computers, and gas stations. Former cyber director at the National Security Agency, Rob Joyce, acknowledged that the group’s past cyber attacks on Iranian steel plants and gas stations demonstrated tangible effects in Iran. He argued that disrupting the availability of the bank’s funds or triggering a broader collapse of trust in Iranian banks could have major impacts in Iran . The U.S. Treasury Department also sanctioned Bank Sepha in 2018 for supporting Iran’s Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Historically, such minting events have coincided with short‑term surges in Bitcoin ( BTC ). Notably, on May 21, when Tether issued $2 billion USDT, the next day BTC broke its previous all‑time high, climbing past $111,000. While minting alone doesn’t guarantee immediate impact, the available on-chain data reveals that major spikes in USDT supply often translate into large inflows to exchanges. Bitcoin price after USDT mint. Source: @Lookonchain How will the mint affect Bitcoin price Research suggests that Bitcoin often reacts positively in the short term following large Tether mints, particularly when on-chain alert accounts like Whale Alert publicly flag the transactions. An article by Dr. Aman Saggu in Blockchain Research Lab found that Bitcoin tends to rise 0.4–0.8% within 5 to 30 minutes after a USDT mint. The response is asymmetric: mints push prices up, while burns have little to no effect. The study, which reviewed minting and burning across Tether blockchains from 2014 to 2021, attributes the price movement to investor psychology, specifically FOMO during bullish sentiment phases. Crucially, the effect is only observed once a mint is announced by Whale Alert or a similar service, suggesting the move is driven more by visibility and sentiment than by actual liquidity impact. Bitcoin price analysis Of course, Tether mints are just one of several factors influencing Bitcoin’s short-term price action. Market sentiment remains fragile, with geopolitical tensions in the Middle East (BTC price even dipping to $102,800 following President Trump’s June 17 warning to Iran) and macroeconomic uncertainty ahead of today’s full Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Traders are watching closely for any signals on the Fed’s rate outlook. A dovish tone could offer relief to crypto markets, while a hawkish stance may weigh on prices. With multiple narratives in play, short-term volatility is expected to remain elevated. Featured image via Shutterstock.

2025-06-18T10:37:26,"Internet Computer (ICP) integrates Solana to create multi-chain apps","The Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) will integrate Solana in an attempt to create multi-chain apps. ICP has already integrated Bitcoin and Ethereum, and is capable of hosting DeFi projects at a lower cost, while tapping the liquidity in those networks. Dfinity Foundation, the creator and major contributor to the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) announced the integration of Solana onto the ICP chain. The new integration uses ICP’s Fusion technology, allowing the protocol to connect to some of the world’s most active public blockchains. “By bridging the gap between Solana and ICP through Chain Fusion, we are granting developers with powerful new tools to build next-generation dApps that unify speed, security, and decentralization in one seamless experience, essentially dissolving the barriers that limit blockchain innovation,” said Jan Camenisch, Chief Technology Officer at Dfinity. The integration of Solana means that the native smart contracts of ICP, known as canisters, can interact with the other chain and fuse DeFi with seamless performance and security. The technology removes the need for a bridge, which is one of the riskiest and most attacked types of smart contracts. Canisters are a form of smart wallets, which allow the reading of addresses and the distribution of funds based on predetermined permission settings. The Chain Fusion technology will enable app builders to launch on ICP without a need for a full migration. This will allow the growing user base of ICP to tap external DeFi liquidity, with higher speed and at a lower cost. Solana apps can also use the efficient on-chain processing of ICP, instead of adding another off-chain component. Dfinity aims for decentralized Internet ecosystem The integration of multiple public chains marks another step for Dfinity toward building a decentralized Internet ecosystem. The fusion of chains will open up additional Web3 opportunities for both projects and end users. The fusion will open up ICP to a potential 4.8M daily active users, after the recent growth of Solana due to meme token and DEX activity. ICP also has a limited DeFi sector, with just under $30M in total value locked, but the chain is suitable to host already established apps in DEX trading and lending. The chain also carries around 297 BTC in wrapped form, also used for DeFi security. Currently, ICP carries around 9K in daily internet identities or active users, based on Token Terminal data . The chain has around 5.3K daily unique active wallets. For now, it remains uncertain which apps will use both chains for their activity. ICP currently trades at around $5.12, within its middle range for the past month. The chain is currently ranked in 190th place based on its activity and apps , while hosting a handful of native projects with their own tokens. Despite its relatively low rank, ICP is one of the growing chains in 2025, aiming to revive its activity during the current bull market and increased demand for Web3 activity. ICP has raised $167M in multiple high-profile ranks, backed by a16z and Polychain Capital. The chain has been through several market cycles since its inception in 2018, and aims to tap the currently hot chains for DEX and lending activity.

2025-06-18T10:30:41,"Bitcoin Volume Surges 100% Amid War Threats – What To Expect","Amid the chaos that was sparked by Israel’s attack on Iran, Bitcoin has climbed again, shaking off the losses triggered by the conflict. Not only has the price seen an increase from its last week’s lows, but there has also been a notable change in the cryptocurrency’s daily trading volume. This points to continued interest despite global factors and could mean that the expectations of war are already getting priced in for the crypto market. Bitcoin Sees Almost 100% Jump In Volume According to data from Coinglass, there has been a turn in the tide for the Bitcoin trading volume after starting out the new week in a slow trend. Sunday and Monday had seen the Bitcoin daily trading volume come out under $50 billion. However, as the Bitcoin price rose leading up to Tuesday, so did the trading volume. Related Reading: What Are The Implications For XRP If Ripple Captures 14% Of SWIFT’s Volume? At the time of writing, the Bitcoin daily trading volume had already crossed $88 billion for Tuesday, leading to an almost 100% increase in the trading volume during this time. This follows the trend of high volatility coming with increased volumes as the Bitcoin price swung wildly between $105,000 and $108,000. The sharp jump in volume comes as the Bitcoin open interest remains high at near all-time highs while the rest of the market struggles. Coinglass data shows the current open interest at $71 billion, less than $10 billion away from the $80 billion all-time high recorded in May 2025. In light of altcoins continuing to trend low while Bitcoin remains close to all-time highs, it suggests that most of the attention in the crypto market is now being focused on Bitcoin. As a result, the leading asset continues to dictate the direction of the market, with dominance remaining high above 64%. How War Could Affect This Trend The positive developments surrounding Bitcoin are coming as there seems to be a cooldown in the conflict in the Middle East. But with so little time having passed, expectations are that the war may only be starting, with some calling it the start of ‘World War 3.’ Related Reading: Key Fractal From 2023 Says Bitcoin Price Is Still Bullish, But A Crash To $90,000 Could Be Coming The Kobeissi Letter has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to address these World War 3 predictions, revealing how the markets would react if there really was a possibility of this happening. The first thing was that a 50% chance of World War 3 would’ve seen the S&P crash not 2%, but more of a 30% crash. Gold would be $5,000/oz, and oil would go for $100/barrel. Furthermore, a 90% chance of World War 3, as explained in the post, would likely cause the S&P to crash 50%, with the prices of gold and oil surging to $10,000/oz and $200/barrel, respectively. Given Bitcoin’s correlation with the stock market so far, there is no doubt that such a crash would have carried over, triggering disastrous losses for the crypto market. Given these, The Kobeissi Letter explains that the markets are saying the chances of World War 3 are slim. At this time, they expect a resolution to the conflict. “Futures all around the board this morning saw de-escalation coming,” the post read.

2025-06-18T10:30:26,"US Spot Bitcoin ETFs See Remarkable $217M Inflows, Signaling Strong Demand","BitcoinWorld US Spot Bitcoin ETFs See Remarkable $217M Inflows, Signaling Strong Demand The crypto market continues to capture significant attention, and recent movements within US spot Bitcoin ETFs are providing valuable insights into investor sentiment. On June 17, these investment vehicles experienced another day of positive activity, extending a notable trend. Understanding the Latest Bitcoin ETF Inflows According to data shared by Trader T (@thepfund) on X, US spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively saw a net inflow of $217.37 million on June 17. This figure is significant as it marks the seventh consecutive trading day where more money flowed into these funds than out. This sustained period of positive flow suggests continued, albeit sometimes moderate, demand for exposure to Bitcoin through regulated and easily accessible ETF products. Breaking Down the $217.37M Inflow Figure While the overall picture for Bitcoin ETF inflows was positive, the performance varied significantly among individual funds. Here’s a look at how the major players fared on June 17: ETF Ticker Issuer Net Flow (June 17) IBIT BlackRock +$640.07 million FBTC Fidelity -$208.46 million ARKB Ark Invest / 21Shares -$191.40 million BITB Bitwise -$22.84 million Other ETFs Various $0 million (no net change) As the table clearly shows, the net positive figure was heavily influenced by one dominant player. BlackRock IBIT Leads the Way BlackRock’s Ishares Bitcoin Trust ( BlackRock IBIT ) was the standout performer on June 17, attracting a massive $640.07 million in net inflows. This single fund’s performance more than offset the outflows seen by several other prominent ETFs, underscoring BlackRock’s continued success in attracting investor capital into its Bitcoin product. IBIT has consistently been a leader in accumulating Bitcoin since its launch in January, and this latest inflow reinforces its position as a preferred vehicle for many investors seeking exposure to the digital asset. What About Other Key Bitcoin ETFs? While BlackRock IBIT saw substantial inflows, other major Bitcoin ETFs experienced outflows. Fidelity’s FBTC had a net outflow of $208.46 million, followed by Ark Invest and 21Shares’ ARKB with $191.40 million in outflows, and Bitwise’s BITB with $22.84 million in outflows. The remaining spot Bitcoin ETFs available in the U.S. market reported no net change in flows for the day. These outflows from some funds, even on a day of overall positive inflows, highlight that not all investors are uniformly bullish or are potentially rebalancing their portfolios. It’s a reminder that while the overall trend of Bitcoin ETF inflows has been positive recently, the market dynamics for individual funds can vary. What Do These Inflows Mean for the Crypto Market? The consistent streak of net inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs , now stretching to seven days, is generally interpreted as a positive signal for the broader crypto market . It indicates continued institutional and potentially retail interest in gaining exposure to Bitcoin through regulated investment products. Benefits of this trend include: Signaling Demand: Sustained inflows demonstrate underlying demand for Bitcoin. Market Maturation: The success of these ETFs points to the increasing maturation and acceptance of Bitcoin as an investable asset class within traditional finance. Potential Price Support: While not a direct price driver in isolation, consistent buying pressure from ETFs can contribute to positive price momentum for Bitcoin over time. However, it’s important to consider nuances: Varied Performance: As seen, not all funds experience inflows equally; some face significant outflows. Market Context: ETF flows are just one factor influencing the complex crypto market , which is also affected by macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, and global events. Actionable insights for investors might include monitoring these flow trends as one data point among many when assessing market sentiment and potential price direction, but avoiding making decisions based solely on daily flow figures. Conclusion: A Positive Streak for US Spot Bitcoin ETFs The seventh consecutive day of net inflows for US spot Bitcoin ETFs on June 17, totaling $217.37 million, underscores a period of renewed positive sentiment and demand for Bitcoin exposure via these regulated products. While outflows from some funds like FBTC and ARKB present a more nuanced picture, the significant inflows into funds like BlackRock IBIT paint an overall positive trend for Bitcoin ETF inflows and provide a constructive signal for the broader crypto market .

2025-06-18T10:20:17,"BTCI: Earning Yields From Bitcoin Without A Bull Thesis","Summary BTCI lets you earn monthly income from Bitcoin exposure without needing a bullish thesis, using covered call and spread strategies on partial spot and synthetic holdings. Holds ~25% in spot Bitcoin ETP and remaining in futures/synthetic positions for tax efficiency and simplified 1099 filing—no K-1s, and capital gains are internally handled. Upside is only partially capped via call spreads, and BTCI offers some drawdown protection and lower volatility, suitable for neutral-to-mildly-bearish market views. Compared to similar funds like YBTC or YBIT, BTCI tracks Bitcoin more closely, offers better long-term upside potential, and hasn’t compromised NAV with aggressive payouts. I am not a bitcoin expert. My analysis of the NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF ( BTCI ) will be purely from an agnostic income generation strategy perspective. Which is fair because if I were to have a thesis on bitcoin, I would play bitcoins directly. The reason I evaluate BTCI is because I am seeking income. Of course there are tactical uses of BTCI that could come up which requires view on the underlying's next move. Those general characteristics of the ETF will be covered. Methodology and What to Expect The ETF works by holding ~25% of assets as spot Bitcoin ETP via a Cayman subsidiary and replicates synthetic positions through bitcoin futures of synthetic futures (an option setup that replicates the futures). his underlying holding structure makes for better tax efficiencies. Unlike many crypto and crypto adjacent fund themes, BTCI does not issue additional K-1 forms for tax compliance. There is one simplified 1099 form that is issues and makes tax handling easier for investors. BTCI also pays capital appreciation taxes on mark to market gains reducing your tax filing to only when there is a payout or withdrawal. But my understanding points to filing efficiencies over tax savings. After taking the cash position, BTCI employs call writing structures (including call spreads if appropriate) on the underlying and aims to generate income over the underlying. Expect this structure to cap upside and reduce drawdowns (but limited to premiums received). Such a structure works out well if the underlying moves flat or corrects. Over a long term, the upside opportunity loss is far higher than the income gains. However BTCI's call spreads do capture a part of the upside. It may manage to create a case for reduced volatility risk adjusted returns. NAV and Yield BTCI is a relatively new income play on bitcoins and shows around ~20% yield. That is not too aggressive and gives a chance for the NAV to retain its levels or even grow if the underlying appreciates. Aggressive payouts are often NAV eroding in nature and shrink future payouts in an absolute sense. Is Bitcoin as Volatile as It Sounds? There was an era when Bitcoin was rallying by leaps and bounds and corrections were extreme as well. That era of volatility appears to be behind us as Bitcoins have matured. Now bitcoins are no more volatile than say a Palantir. Not docile enough compared to Google or a broad index ETF like QQQ. But sufficient volatility to be earn more premiums on wins to be able to offset single large losses. It is not as volatile as MSTR as well to make winning difficult. Too high volatility is a killer for option strategies as managing option sell structures become difficult. Either ends up in large opportunity losses or large drawdowns, sometime both. Bitcoin qualifies with just the ideal amount of volatility today to attempt option writing on. Data by YCharts Comparison with Bitcoin In the relatively short period of existence, BTCI shows underperformance against bitcoins (proxied as IBIT), particularly since the period of analysis has been largely bullish. That's expected. The underperformance is not huge either given the quantum of upside within a short period of time. Data by YCharts Zooming into the only significant drawdown period for Bitcoin, the limited drawdown protection is evident for BTCI. This is decent delta saved on drawdowns but not large enough to offset the upside opportunity losses. There is a case for BTCI on drawdowns, but not strong. Data by YCharts Comparison with Other Bitcoin Income ETFs I will compare BTCI's total returns against YBTC and YBIT , two other income generating bitcoin based ETFs. Both have a similar proposition, but for no physical holdings in Bitcoin (which BTCI has), fully capped upside (BTCI has partial upside exposure through spreads) and much more aggressive payouts. YBIT has started to drag from potential payout pressures. But between YBTC and BTCI, the latter is the more aggressive total growth vehicle i.e. it tracks Bitcoin more closely. Higer upsides can be captured at times (not always) through BTCI, but there is no great downside excess vs YBTC. If we see the performance graphs, the one time upside gained in BTCI in November 2024 is more or less retained throughout since. That is the spread at work - capturing big upsides at speed, but not always. Data by YCharts Data by YCharts Final Call - Buy BTCI BTCI's structure shows ability to closely track bitcoin while reducing downsides a bit. Its drawdown performance is not great but provides cushion even if limited. The upside opportunity loss is not as great as in the case of YBTC (YBTC will likely manage drawdowns slightly better although not much evidence so far). If you are bullish Bitcoins even after the last rally, buy Bitcoin. The use case for any option income generator like BTCI appears when you want to tactically use it for a bearish to flat view. The other use case is to generate income without having to actively manage payouts from a core Bitcoin holding. I rate BTCI a buy among the alternative option writing strategies on Bitcoin. If you value downside reduction far more than growth and are looking for steady yields prefer BTCI in your portfolio. For aggressive income de-risking you from Bitcoins quicker and better volatility management, YBTC could make the cut also. But so far, BTCI even over YBTC till new patterns emerge.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4795642-btci-earning-yields-from-bitcoin-without-a-bull-thesis?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","BTCI",cryptocompare
2025-06-18T10:20:07,"Bitcoin’s Explosive Potential: LTH Selling Signals Major Bull Run","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Explosive Potential: LTH Selling Signals Major Bull Run Are we on the cusp of another significant move for Bitcoin ? Recent observations from prominent crypto analysts suggest that key market participants, specifically Long-Term Holders (LTHs), are exhibiting behavior historically associated with periods preceding substantial price increases. This fascinating insight, derived from on-chain data, offers a compelling look into the underlying conviction of those who have held onto their Bitcoin through thick and thin. What Are Bitcoin Long-Term Holders (LTHs) and Why Do They Matter? In the world of Bitcoin , holders are often categorized based on how long they’ve kept their coins. Short-Term Holders (STHs) typically hold Bitcoin for less than 155 days, often being newer market entrants or traders. Long-Term Holders (LTHs), on the other hand, are wallets that have held their Bitcoin for 155 days or longer. This distinction is crucial because LTHs represent the ‘strong hands’ in the market – those with high conviction who are less likely to sell during minor dips or volatility. Their selling or accumulation patterns can provide significant clues about the overall market sentiment and potential supply dynamics. When LTHs sell, it can indicate profit-taking or capitulation. When they stop selling or even accumulate, it often signals confidence in future price appreciation and can lead to a supply squeeze on exchanges, potentially driving prices up. Understanding the behavior of this cohort is a cornerstone of effective crypto analysis . Decoding the Bullish Signal : LTH Selling Reaches Historic Lows According to crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr., the current selling activity from Bitcoin Long-Term Holders is approaching levels rarely seen before. This means that despite market fluctuations, the most experienced and conviction-driven holders are choosing not to liquidate their positions. This lack of selling pressure from a group that holds a significant portion of the circulating supply is inherently bullish. Think of it this way: if the people who bought Bitcoin months or years ago, potentially at much lower prices, are holding onto their coins instead of cashing out, it suggests they believe the price is headed significantly higher. This collective decision by LTHs reduces the available supply on the market, especially on exchanges, making it easier for new demand to push the Bitcoin price upward. Past Performance: How Bitcoin Price Reacted to Similar LTH Behavior One of the most compelling aspects of this observation is its historical context. The analyst points out that there have been only four previous instances where LTH selling reached such low levels. The results following three of these four instances were remarkably consistent and positive for the Bitcoin price . Instance 1: LTH selling hits low. Instance 2: LTH selling hits low. Instance 3: LTH selling hits low. Instance 4 (Current): LTH selling hits low. In the three preceding cases, Bitcoin experienced price gains ranging from 18% to 25% within a relatively short timeframe of six to eight weeks. While past performance is never a guarantee of future results, this recurring pattern provides a strong historical precedent for expecting a positive price reaction in the near future based on the current LTH behavior. This historical data is a critical component in performing thorough crypto analysis . Supporting Evidence: Other Bullish Signals from On-Chain Crypto Analysis The positive outlook isn’t solely reliant on LTH behavior. The analyst’s update also highlighted other key on-chain metrics that are flashing green. Two notable examples are Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) and Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV). Coin Days Destroyed (CDD): This metric gives more weight to coins that haven’t moved for a long time. A low CDD value indicates that older Bitcoin (held by LTHs) is not being spent or moved. Currently, low CDD values reinforce the observation that LTHs are holding, reducing selling pressure and indicating conviction rather than distribution. Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV): This ratio compares the current market price (Market Value) to the average purchase price of all coins (Realized Value). It helps identify periods where Bitcoin might be overvalued or undervalued relative to the cost basis of its holders. An MVRV ratio typically below 1 suggests undervaluation (though we are likely above 1 now, the *trend* and specific levels within a cycle are key). Bullish signals often emerge when MVRV is recovering from lower levels or consolidating at levels historically seen before price rallies, indicating that the market as a whole is not yet excessively profitable, thus reducing the incentive for widespread selling. The confluence of these metrics – low LTH selling, low CDD, and favorable MVRV trends – paints a cohesive picture of a market structure that appears primed for potential upward movement, according to this crypto analysis perspective. Beyond the Data: Current Bitcoin Market Trends While on-chain data provides invaluable insights into holder behavior, it’s also important to consider the broader market context. We are currently operating within a post-halving environment, a period historically associated with increased scarcity and subsequent price appreciation. Institutional interest remains a significant factor, with ongoing inflows into Bitcoin ETFs providing consistent demand. Macroeconomic factors, while always a consideration, currently see central banks potentially shifting towards more accommodative policies, which could be favorable for risk assets like Bitcoin . However, challenges remain. Regulatory uncertainty in various jurisdictions, potential for unexpected macroeconomic shocks, and the inherent volatility of the crypto market are factors that investors must always keep in mind. A comprehensive approach to understanding the potential trajectory of the Bitcoin price requires looking at both the micro (on-chain) and macro factors. Potential Challenges and Considerations for Your Bitcoin Investment While the signals discussed are undeniably bullish, it’s crucial to approach them with a balanced perspective. Here are some challenges and considerations: Correlation vs. Causation: Historical patterns show correlation, but other factors could have been at play during those past instances. Market Sentiment Shifts: Unexpected news or events can quickly change market psychology, overriding on-chain signals. Global Macro Factors: Significant shifts in interest rates, inflation, or geopolitical events can impact all risk assets, including Bitcoin . Low Selling Doesn’t Equal No Selling: While LTH selling is low, it’s not zero, and large individual holders could still influence the market. Relying solely on one or two metrics, even compelling ones like LTH behavior, is risky. A holistic view incorporating technical analysis, fundamental factors, and overall market sentiment is always recommended for any Bitcoin investment strategy. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Market Based on LTH Data So, what does this mean for you as an investor or someone interested in Bitcoin ? Use it as a Data Point: View the LTH analysis as a strong piece of evidence supporting a potentially bullish outlook, but not the only piece. Consider Your Time Horizon: This signal, historically, points to gains over the next few weeks to months (6-8 weeks according to the analyst). It aligns well with a medium-term bullish perspective. Risk Management is Key: Regardless of bullish signals, never invest more than you can afford to lose. Use stop-losses or position sizing appropriate for your risk tolerance. Stay Informed: Continue to follow other on-chain metrics, technical indicators, and market news. Good crypto analysis is ongoing. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand the metrics yourself or consult with a financial advisor before making investment decisions based on this or any other analysis. The low selling from Long-Term Holders is a powerful indicator of conviction within the Bitcoin ecosystem and provides a compelling bullish signal for the potential direction of the Bitcoin price in the near future. Conclusion The current state of Bitcoin Long-Term Holders selling activity, reaching near-historical lows, is a significant development that seasoned market observers are taking note of. Coupled with supporting bullish signals from metrics like CDD and MVRV, the picture painted by on-chain crypto analysis is one of underlying strength and conviction among those who hold the vast majority of Bitcoin supply. While the market is subject to various influences, this particular signal, with its strong historical precedent of leading to 18-25% gains in 6-8 weeks, offers a compelling argument for a potentially explosive move for the Bitcoin price ahead. As always, prudent investing requires combining such insights with a broader understanding of the market and personal risk management.

2025-06-18T10:17:20,"Bitcoin 'Accumulator' Better Fit for Corporates Than Dollar-Cost Averaging Strategy, Research Suggests","Corporate adoption of bitcoin BTC is well-known, and most of it involves a classic buy-and-hold strategy, loosely analogous to the dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy. While investors of all kinds widely prefer DCA, new research by crypto options market maker OrBit Markets shows that since 2023, it has underperformed a structured product called an ""accumulator,"" popularly known as ""I Kill You Later"" in traditional markets. ""Our backtest results show that the accumulator strategy outperformed DCA over the past 2.5-year period,"" said Pulkit Goyal, head of trading at OrBit Markets, told CoinDesk. ""Three-month accumulators delivered a 10% outperformance, while longer tenors did even better — six- and twelve-month accumulators outperformed by 13% and 26%, respectively."" Goyal added that accumulators offer a disciplined, cost-effective approach to token accumulation, making them ""a natural fit for crypto treasury companies' use case."" Both DCA and the accumulator operate the same principle – stop timing the market. While DCA simplifies investing by spreading out purchases over time, the accumulator helps acquire coins at a discount in a structured setup and helps outperform DCA during bull runs. Primer on accumulator The accumulator is a time-structured product linked to the performance of an underlying asset with an upside knock-out barrier – level, which, if hit, terminates the structure. Here is how it works: An investor agrees to buy a certain amount of the underlying asset at a fixed, discounted price (the Strike) over regular intervals, such as daily or weekly, for a set period. The product runs through the pre-determined set period unless terminated early due to an early knock-out by the spot price rising to the barrier. Note that the investor has an obligation, not a choice, to buy the asset at the discounted strike price and must double the buy in case the spot price dips below the discounted strike. Example of BTC accumulator Consider a three-month accumulator where an investor commits to buy $1,000 worth of BTC every week at a strike price of $94,500, with a knock-out level of $115,000. The strike price of $94,500 is 90% of the current spot price of around $105,000. In other words, the investor is now mandated to snap up coins at a discount, assuming the spot price holds above the strike price of $94,500 and below the knock-out of $115,000. If BTC tops the knock-out level, the structure is terminated. If the price falls below $94,500, the investor doubles the weekly purchase to $ 4,000 at the same strike, i.e., $94,500 – there is no way out, meaning the investor ends up buying at a price higher than the prevailing market rate. (this is why it gets the nickname ""I kill you later."") Hence, the accumulator is not suitable for day traders, short-term traders and speculators and may not necessarily outperform DCA in a bear market. Backtesting OrBit backtested a three-month BTC accumulator, spanning from January 2023 to June 13, 2025, assuming the investor continuously rolled into a new one upon reaching maturity or a premature knock-out event. Results show an average BTC acquisition cost of $39,035 for the accumulator, which is 10% lower than the DCA average purchase price of $43,329. The DCA involved investing a fixed dollar amount in BTC every week. Longer maturity accumulators of 6 and 12 months performed even better, achieving average costs of $37,654 and $32,079, respectively, outperforming DCA by 13% and 26%.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/18/bitcoin-accumulator-better-fit-for-corporates-than-dollar-cost-averaging-strategy-research-suggests,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH","Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Institutions|market analysis|Bitcoin Treasury Reserve Asset|News",cryptocompare
