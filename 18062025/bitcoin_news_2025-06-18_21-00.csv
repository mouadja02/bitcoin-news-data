2025-06-18T18:45:51,"Alex Mashinsky Barred From Receiving Any Assets From Celsius Bankruptcy Claims","Celsius founder Alex Mashinsky will not receive any assets from the collapsed crypto lending platform’s bankruptcy claims. Newly filed court documents indicate Mashinsky withdrew his claims in light of his criminal sentencing last month. Celsius filed for bankruptcy in July 2022 after its native token, CEL, plummeted by 99%, and it was unable to fulfill withdrawals. Mashinsky was arrested in 2023 and pleaded guilty to one count of commodities fraud and one count of securities fraud last December. The Department of Justice (DOJ) said the Celsius founder falsely represented the lender as a safe and secure platform and exaggerated its potential for profitability, greatly inflating its user base. Last month, a US district judge sentenced Mashinsky to 12 years in prison. After the sentencing, US Attorney Jay Clayton said the Celsius founder targeted retail investors with false promises, used customer funds to place risky bets and profited tens of millions of dollars while his customers lost billions. “America’s investors deserve better. The case for tokenization and the use of digital assets is strong but it is not a license to deceive. The rules against fraud still apply, and the SDNY (Southern District of New York) will hold those who flout them accountable for their crimes.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-18T18:41:00,"‘Next Parabolic Move’ for Bitcoin Approaching As Two Historically Reliable Macro Indicators Flash Green, According to Analyst","A closely followed crypto analyst says Bitcoin ( BTC ) could be on the cusp of its next explosive rally, as two key macroeconomic indicators with a track record of accurately predicting bull runs flash green. In a newly released macro report , pseudonymous analyst TechDev highlights the copper-to-gold ratio and M2 money’s supply year-over-year change as critical signals pointing to a brewing Bitcoin surge. The copper/gold ratio, often viewed as a proxy for economic risk appetite, has begun to trend upward – a move TechDev notes has historically preceded BTC bull markets by several months. “As of mid-2025, the ratio has stopped declining and is stabilizing, even showing signs of turning higher. This suggests that investors are beginning to anticipate recovery. If copper begins to outperform gold in the coming quarters, it would signal a bottoming of the business cycle – precisely the kind of macro regime change that supports a bitcoin bull run.” Source: TechDev And the analyst says global M2 money supply – a broad measure of liquidity in the world financial system – has flipped from negative to positive annual growth, also a signal that he says has preceded each of Bitcoin’s parabolic phases by 6–10 months, suggesting a strong probability that another upward cycle is imminent. “When global M2 is rising, Bitcoin typically follows suit. This dynamic is visible across multiple cycles. In the aftermath of the 2020 COVID crisis, for instance, global M2 surged at the fastest rate in modern history. Bitcoin responded by rallying from under $10,000 to over $60,000 in just over a year. Conversely, when central banks tighten policy as they did in 2022 and 2023 to combat inflation, global M2 flattens or contracts. During this time, Bitcoin struggled. Its price declined sharply in tandem with falling liquidity, reinforcing that it is not sentiment but capital flow that drives crypto price action. As liquidity dried up, so did Bitcoin’s momentum.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-18T18:40:11,"BlackRock BUIDL Tokenization: A Strategic Boost for Crypto Collateral Adoption","BitcoinWorld BlackRock BUIDL Tokenization: A Strategic Boost for Crypto Collateral Adoption The world of finance is constantly evolving, and the intersection of traditional markets and digital assets is heating up. A significant development making waves is the integration of real-world assets (RWAs) into the crypto ecosystem. At the forefront of this trend is BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, whose move to tokenize assets is now directly impacting how institutional players engage with cryptocurrency exchanges. The recent announcement that major platforms like Crypto.com and Deribit will accept BlackRock BUIDL as collateral marks a pivotal moment, signaling growing confidence and utility for tokenized assets within the digital finance landscape. What Exactly is BlackRock BUIDL and Why Does it Matter for Institutional Crypto? BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, known as BUIDL, is a groundbreaking initiative. It’s a tokenized representation of U.S. Treasury bills and repurchase agreements, built on the Ethereum network. Think of it as a blockchain-native version of a highly stable, yield-generating traditional finance asset. Here’s a breakdown of why BUIDL is significant: Yield-Bearing: Unlike typical stablecoins or even volatile cryptocurrencies used as collateral, BUIDL offers a yield, currently around 4.5% annually (based on the underlying assets and market conditions mentioned in reports). This means the collateral itself is earning returns for the holder. Stability: Backed by U.S. Treasurys, BUIDL aims for price stability, making it a much less volatile form of collateral compared to using Bitcoin or Ethereum, which can experience significant price swings. Institutional Pedigree: Launched by BlackRock, a name synonymous with institutional finance, BUIDL carries a level of trust and familiarity that can ease the concerns of traditional institutions looking to enter or expand their presence in the crypto market. Blockchain-Native: Existing on the blockchain allows for potential benefits like faster settlement times and increased transparency compared to traditional processes, although the primary interface for institutions might still be through regulated platforms. For institutions eyeing the institutional crypto space, BUIDL offers a bridge – a regulated, familiar asset class delivered in a novel, digital format. How Does Using BlackRock BUIDL as Crypto Collateral Work? The core function of collateral in trading is to mitigate counterparty risk. When an institution wants to trade derivatives, engage in margin trading, or conduct large OTC deals on a crypto exchange, they are typically required to post collateral to cover potential losses. Traditionally, this might involve posting Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, or even fiat currency held by the exchange or a custodian. With Crypto.com and Deribit now accepting BUIDL, institutional clients have a new option. Instead of tying up capital in non-yield-bearing or volatile assets, they can potentially use their holdings in the BlackRock BUIDL fund. Key aspects of this implementation: Target Audience: This offering is specifically aimed at institutional clients, not retail traders. These are large funds, asset managers, and proprietary trading firms. Supported Trading Types: The BUIDL collateral can be used across various trading activities offered by the exchanges, including spot trading, margin trading, derivatives (like futures and options), and over-the-counter (OTC) deals. Capital Efficiency: By using a yield-bearing asset like BUIDL as collateral, institutions can potentially improve their capital efficiency. Their collateral isn’t just sitting idle; it’s generating a return, which can offset trading costs or enhance overall profitability. Risk Management: While crypto assets are volatile, BUIDL offers relative stability due to its underlying U.S. Treasury holdings. This can simplify risk management for institutions, reducing the risk of margin calls triggered solely by the depreciation of the collateral asset itself. This move by Crypto.com and Deribit directly addresses a pain point for traditional institutions: finding suitable, regulated, and efficient forms of crypto collateral that align with their risk management frameworks. The Growing Significance of Tokenized Assets and RWA Tokenization The acceptance of BlackRock BUIDL as collateral is a powerful illustration of a much broader trend: the increasing tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). RWA tokenization involves issuing digital tokens on a blockchain that represent ownership or fractional ownership of tangible or intangible assets outside the traditional crypto space. Why is RWA tokenization gaining traction? Increased Liquidity: Tokenizing illiquid assets (like real estate, art, or private equity) can potentially make them more accessible and easier to trade. Fractional Ownership: Allows multiple investors to own a portion of a high-value asset that would otherwise be out of reach. Enhanced Transparency and Efficiency: Blockchain technology can provide clear ownership records and streamline settlement processes. New Yield Opportunities: As seen with BUIDL, tokenized versions of yield-bearing assets can bring those yields into the digital asset ecosystem. BlackRock’s foray into BUIDL is not just about creating a token; it’s about exploring how blockchain technology can be used to manage and transact traditional financial assets more effectively. The acceptance of BUIDL as tokenized assets for collateral on major exchanges validates the utility and potential of this emerging sector within crypto and TradFi. What Does This Mean for the Future of Institutional Crypto and Digital Assets? The integration of BlackRock BUIDL as collateral is more than just a feature update for Crypto.com and Deribit; it’s a strong signal about the direction of the market. It indicates a maturing ecosystem where regulated, traditional finance products are finding practical applications within the digital asset space. Implications for the future: Increased Institutional Participation: By offering familiar and stable collateral options like BUIDL, exchanges are lowering the barrier to entry for traditional financial institutions who may have been hesitant due to the volatility of native crypto assets. Demand for RWA Solutions: The success of BUIDL could spur further development and adoption of other tokenized assets representing various asset classes (e.g., private credit, real estate funds). Evolution of Crypto Collateral: We might see a shift towards more diverse and potentially more stable forms of collateral being accepted on exchanges, moving beyond just major cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. Regulatory Clarity (Gradual): While BUIDL operates within existing securities regulations, its use on crypto platforms highlights the ongoing need for clearer regulatory frameworks surrounding tokenized securities and their interaction with the crypto market. This development reinforces the narrative that the lines between traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi) are blurring, with institutional players like BlackRock playing a key role in building the necessary infrastructure and products. Considering the Benefits and Potential Challenges Let’s summarize the pros and cons of this development: Benefits: Provides a stable, yield-bearing collateral option for institutions. Enhances capital efficiency for institutional trading. Leverages the trust and reputation of BlackRock. Validates the utility and potential of RWA tokenization . Lowers barriers for traditional finance institutions entering crypto markets. Diversifies available crypto collateral options. Potential Challenges/Considerations: Accessibility is limited to institutional clients. Requires integration and infrastructure updates from exchanges and custodians. Liquidity of BUIDL itself within the crypto ecosystem needs to grow. Navigating the regulatory nuances between tokenized securities and crypto platforms. Market acceptance and understanding of tokenized traditional assets within crypto circles. Despite potential hurdles, the acceptance of BUIDL is overwhelmingly seen as a positive step for the maturation and institutional adoption of the crypto market. Actionable Insights for Market Watchers For those following the market, this development offers several key insights: Keep an eye on other major exchanges and platforms – will they follow suit and accept BUIDL or other tokenized assets as collateral? Watch for further RWA tokenization initiatives from traditional finance giants. This is likely just the beginning. Understand that institutional crypto adoption is progressing, albeit through careful, often regulated, steps like this one. The demand for stable, yield-generating assets within the crypto ecosystem is high, driving innovation in areas like BUIDL and other RWA projects. A Milestone for Crypto Collateral and Institutional Adoption The decision by Crypto.com and Deribit to accept BlackRock’s BUIDL fund as collateral is a significant milestone. It brings a highly reputable, yield-bearing, and relatively stable traditional finance asset into the heart of crypto trading infrastructure for institutional clients. This move not only validates the potential of BlackRock BUIDL and RWA tokenization but also paves a clearer path for greater institutional crypto participation by providing more familiar and efficient crypto collateral options. As the digital asset space continues to evolve, the convergence with traditional finance, led by initiatives like BUIDL, is set to reshape how institutions interact with crypto markets.

2025-06-18T18:20:11,"BitMine Makes Bold Bitcoin Purchase: $16.3M Stock Offering Fuels Strategic Crypto Treasury","BitcoinWorld BitMine Makes Bold Bitcoin Purchase: $16.3M Stock Offering Fuels Strategic Crypto Treasury In a significant move demonstrating strong conviction in digital assets, BitMine Immersion Technologies, a company known for its Bitcoin mining operations, has announced a major strategic investment. The company utilized the entirety of the net proceeds from its recent stock offering to acquire a substantial amount of Bitcoin. This action highlights a growing trend among corporations to build and maintain a dedicated Crypto Treasury as part of their long-term financial strategy. What Did BitMine Do With Its Stock Offering Proceeds? BitMine Immersion Technologies, listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), recently completed a stock offering. The goal of this offering was to raise capital, and the company has now revealed exactly how it deployed those funds. According to a press release distributed via GlobeNewswire, BitMine took the entire net proceeds from this offering, totaling $16.3 million, and converted it into Bitcoin . Specifically, the company acquired 154.17 Bitcoin. The press release stated the average purchase price for this acquisition was approximately $106,033 per BTC. This strategic allocation of capital directly into the primary asset class it operates within signals a clear commitment to Bitcoin’s future value proposition and its role within BitMine’s corporate structure. Why Build a Corporate Crypto Treasury? The concept of a corporate Crypto Treasury , primarily consisting of Bitcoin, has gained traction over the past few years. Companies opt for this strategy for various reasons, often viewing Bitcoin as a store of value, a potential hedge against inflation, or an asset with significant long-term growth potential. For a Bitcoin mining company like BitMine, holding BTC on its balance sheet aligns naturally with its core business operations and investment philosophy. Key motivations behind establishing a Crypto Treasury can include: Long-Term Value Appreciation: Belief in Bitcoin’s potential for significant price increases over time. Inflation Hedge: Positioning Bitcoin as a scarce digital asset potentially resilient to inflationary pressures affecting fiat currencies. Alignment with Business Model: For crypto-native companies like miners, holding the asset they produce is a logical extension of their operations. Shareholder Value: Potentially increasing shareholder value through the appreciation of treasury assets. BitMine explicitly stated its aim to build a long-term Bitcoin treasury, indicating this BTC purchase is not intended for short-term trading but rather as a foundational element of their balance sheet for the foreseeable future. Understanding the Stock Offering and BTC Purchase Connection The direct link between the recent Stock Offering and the BTC purchase is crucial to understanding BitMine’s financial maneuvering. A stock offering is a way for a company to raise funds by selling shares of its stock to the public. In this case, BitMine successfully raised capital through this method, and instead of using the funds solely for operational expansion or debt reduction (though these might also be goals), they chose to dedicate the entire net proceeds specifically to acquiring Bitcoin. This move demonstrates a high level of confidence in Bitcoin as an asset class. It’s not just using existing cash reserves, but actively raising external capital through traditional financial markets (NYSE) and immediately deploying it into the cryptocurrency market. This strategy could be seen as leveraging traditional finance to strengthen their position in the digital asset space. Key points about this connection: The stock offering provided the necessary capital ($16.3M net). 100% of these net funds were allocated to the BTC purchase . This links traditional equity markets directly to cryptocurrency investment for the company. BitMine’s Strategic Position After the BTC Purchase Following this substantial BTC purchase , BitMine Immersion Technologies is now positioned with a significant corporate Crypto Treasury . This treasury size, holding over 154 Bitcoin, places them among other public companies that hold digital assets on their balance sheet, albeit the size relative to market cap varies significantly across companies. For a Bitcoin mining company, accumulating BTC is often seen as a core part of its strategy, allowing it to benefit not only from the mining process but also from the potential appreciation of the asset it mines. By using the Stock Offering funds for this purpose, BitMine has effectively converted external investment into direct exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements, in addition to their operational exposure through mining. This strategic decision reflects management’s view on the future trajectory of Bitcoin and their commitment to accumulating the asset during what they presumably see as an opportune time, even at an average price point of $106,033 as stated in the press release. What Does This Mean for BitMine and Investors? For BitMine, this move solidifies its balance sheet with a significant digital asset holding. The value of this treasury will fluctuate directly with the price of Bitcoin , introducing a new dynamic to the company’s financial performance beyond just mining efficiency and operational costs. A rising Bitcoin price would positively impact their treasury value, while a falling price would have the opposite effect. For investors, this transparency about using Stock Offering funds for a direct BTC purchase provides clarity on the company’s capital allocation strategy. Investors are now directly exposed to BitMine’s operational performance *and* its strategic treasury management. Companies pursuing a Crypto Treasury strategy often appeal to investors who are bullish on Bitcoin itself and want exposure through publicly traded equities. In conclusion, BitMine Immersion Technologies’ decision to deploy the full $16.3 million from its recent stock offering into purchasing 154.17 Bitcoin is a bold statement of intent. It underscores the company’s commitment to building a long-term Crypto Treasury and leverages traditional financial mechanisms to strengthen its position within the digital asset ecosystem. This strategic BTC purchase , funded entirely by the Stock Offering , positions BitMine with significant direct exposure to Bitcoin’s future performance, adding a new dimension to its financial profile and investment appeal.

2025-06-18T18:13:27,"Bitcoin price steady as Fed keeps interest rates stable","The Federal Reserve has decided to keep interest rates at current levels, maintaining a cautious stance on inflation. A strong labor market, steady growth, and somewhat elevated inflation prompted the Fed to hold rates steady. On Wednesday, June 18, the Federal Open Market Committee announced it would maintain rates in the 4.25% to 4.5% range, in line with market expectations. The FOMC noted that future rate decisions will remain data-dependent. Bitcoin (BTC) remained resilient ahead of the Fed decision, recovering some earlier losses. BTC was trading at $104,364, up 0.43% over the past 24 hours, while the total crypto market cap rose 0.22% to $3.23 trillion. The Fed’s decision came amid growing tensions in the Israel-Iran conflict, which is fueling macroeconomic uncertainty. Rising oil prices could reignite inflationary pressures, which have shown signs of easing in recent months. Due to this uncertainty, the market consensus was that the Fed would keep the rates stable. A CME Group’s poll showed a likelihood of 99.9% that the Fed would maintain rates, despite ongoing pressures from the White House. Trump continues to pressure the Fed On the same day, U.S. President Donald Trump stated that “stupid” Fed Chair Jerome Powell will likely keep the rates at their current levels. The remarks were part of ongoing attacks on the Fed, with Trump urging them to lower rates by 2 points. “So we have a stupid person. Frankly, you probably won’t cut today,” Trump said. “Europe had 10 cuts, and we had none. And I guess he’s a political guy, I don’t know. He’s a political guy who’s not a smart person, but he’s costing the country a fortune.” Trump argues that lower rates would stimulate economic activity and boost the stock market. However, the Fed has continued to prioritize inflation control and has so far resisted political pressure, especially amid lingering inflationary risks, partially driven by the tariff regime introduced under Trump’s own administration.

Baylina retains a founder’s title, but his team and codebase are now fully independent. On June 18, Polygon co-founder Jordi Baylina took to X to announce that he and the core zkEVM development team have spun out to form Zisk, an independent project focused on advancing low-latency, open-source zero-knowledge virtual machine technology. All intellectual property tied to the effort, including codebases developed under Polygon’s umbrella, has been transferred to SilentSig GmbH, a Swiss entity wholly owned by Baylina. According to Zisk’s website, the team had been incubating the project within Polygon since May 2024, before formalizing the carve-out on June 13. You might also like: Here’s why Polygon price is at risk of a 25% plunge The Zisk gambit: how Polygon’s zkEVM exodus could reshape zero-knowledge tech Baylina’s spinout comes just a week after a major leadership shakeup at Polygon, with co-founder Sandeep Nailwal taking direct control of the Polygon Foundation. Following his appointment, Nailwal quickly introduced a new roadmap that sidelined the zero-knowledge EVM in favor of Polygon PoS and its AggLayer interoperability protocol. The decision effectively shuttered a project that had been burning over $1 million annually. Blockchain researcher Lorenz Lehmann noted on X that Polygon had “quietly abandoned” development, despite investing nine figures into the initiative. Soon Polygon zkEVM will shut down. Quick recap: >Polygon acquired Hermez for $250M in 2021 >Rebranded to Polygon zkEVM >Development quietly abandoned >Never upgraded to use Blobs, chain runs at 1M$+ loss/y >Announce chain will shut down https://t.co/paYx0P06oi pic.twitter.com/0uJAPSvOFX — Lorenz Lehmann (@LehmannLorenz) June 16, 2025 For Baylina and his team, the writing was on the wall. Rather than resist the shift, they opted to forge a new path. With Zisk, Baylina aims to eliminate the overhead of legacy architecture and focus on delivering the core promise of what zkEVM aspired to be but never fully achieved. While current zkVMs like Polygon zkEVM emphasize EVM compatibility, Zisk’s architecture prioritizes low-latency proofs, a critical requirement for real-world use cases such as decentralized exchanges and gaming. Early benchmarks suggest Zisk’s approach could reduce verification times by 40–60% compared to incumbent solutions, though independent audits will be required to verify those claims. The spinout also inherits Polygon zkEVM’s open-source legacy, with Baylina pledging to keep Zisk’s codebase permissionless.

2025-06-18T18:10:11,"Bitcoin Investment Strategy: Accumulator Shockingly Outperforms DCA Since 2023","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Investment Strategy: Accumulator Shockingly Outperforms DCA Since 2023 When it comes to navigating the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, particularly market leader Bitcoin, investors often look for reliable strategies to build their holdings over time. The Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) method is perhaps the most widely known and adopted Bitcoin investment strategy , praised for its simplicity and ability to reduce timing risk. However, recent analysis from institutional liquidity provider Orbit Markets has thrown a fascinating curveball, suggesting that another approach – the accumulator strategy – has significantly outperformed DCA for Bitcoin investors since the beginning of 2023. This finding from the Orbit Markets analysis challenges conventional wisdom and warrants a closer look for anyone serious about crypto investment . Understanding the Accumulator Strategy and DCA Bitcoin Before diving into the performance comparison, let’s quickly recap what these two strategies entail: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): This is a straightforward approach where an investor invests a fixed amount of money at regular intervals (e.g., $100 every week) regardless of the asset’s price. The idea is that you buy more shares (or Bitcoin) when the price is low and fewer when the price is high, averaging out your purchase cost over time. It removes emotion from investing and is easy to automate. It’s a popular DCA Bitcoin method for beginners and long-term holders. Accumulator Strategy: This is a more active strategy, often used in traditional finance for accumulating assets at favorable prices. In the context of Bitcoin, it typically involves setting a target price below the current market price to buy Bitcoin at a discount. If the price falls further, the investor commits to buying even more, often in increasing increments. The goal is to lower the average purchase price by aggressively buying dips. It requires more monitoring and a willingness to increase exposure during downturns. This is the core of the Accumulator strategy . Orbit Markets Analysis: Why Accumulator Pulled Ahead Since 2023 According to the analysis conducted by Orbit Markets, the accumulator strategy demonstrated a clear performance edge over the traditional DCA approach when applied to Bitcoin investments made since January 1, 2023. This specific timeframe is crucial, as it covers a significant period of recovery and growth for the Bitcoin market following the bear market lows of 2022. The key findings highlighted by Orbit Markets are compelling: Over a three-month period, the accumulator strategy delivered approximately 10% higher returns compared to DCA. Extending the timeframe to 12 months, the outperformance became even more pronounced, with the accumulator strategy yielding up to 26% greater returns than DCA. So, why did the Accumulator strategy Bitcoin approach perform so much better during this period? The Orbit Markets analysis suggests that DCA was less effective, particularly during bull runs. While DCA steadily buys through all market conditions, including rallies, the accumulator strategy is designed to capitalize on price dips. The period since early 2023, while generally bullish, has seen notable price corrections and volatility. The accumulator strategy, by specifically targeting these dips and increasing purchase size as prices fell, was able to acquire Bitcoin at lower average prices than a fixed-interval DCA plan. Imagine the market movement since 2023: Bitcoin started recovering, had significant upward moves, but also experienced sharp pullbacks. A DCA investor bought consistently every week or month, buying through highs and lows. An accumulator investor, however, might have set buy orders below the market price, accumulating more Bitcoin during those price drops. When the market subsequently rebounded, the accumulator investor held a larger position acquired at a lower average cost, leading to superior returns. Benefits and Challenges of Each Crypto Investment Strategy Understanding the pros and cons is vital when choosing a Bitcoin investment strategy : Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) – The Steady Hand: Benefits: Simplicity: Easy to understand and implement, even for beginners. Reduces Timing Risk: Eliminates the need to predict market movements. You buy regardless of price. Emotional Control: Automating investments removes impulsive decisions driven by fear or greed. Accessibility: Many platforms offer automated DCA features for DCA Bitcoin . Challenges: May Miss Optimal Entries: Doesn’t specifically capitalize on significant price dips. Potential Underperformance in Strong Bull Runs: As the Orbit Markets analysis noted, it can be less effective than strategies designed to leverage volatility in certain market phases. Averages Up in Sustained Rallies: You keep buying at higher prices during a continuous upward trend. Accumulator Strategy – The Opportunist: Benefits: Potential for Higher Returns: As shown by the Orbit Markets analysis since 2023, it can significantly outperform in markets with dips within an overall uptrend. Lower Average Cost: Designed to acquire assets at discounted prices by buying dips. Leverages Volatility: Thrives in markets that move up but experience pullbacks. Challenges: Requires Active Management: Needs monitoring and setting/adjusting buy orders. Increased Risk in Downtrends: If the price keeps falling without significant rebounds, you keep buying more, potentially leading to larger losses than DCA. Emotional Challenge: Buying more as the price falls can be psychologically difficult. Complexity: More complex to set up and manage than simple DCA. Execution Risk: Orders might not fill if the price doesn’t hit your target. Is the Accumulator Strategy Right for Your Crypto Investment? The findings from the Orbit Markets analysis are compelling, but they don’t necessarily mean everyone should abandon DCA Bitcoin for the accumulator strategy immediately. The best crypto investment approach depends heavily on individual circumstances, risk tolerance, time commitment, and market outlook. Here are some factors to consider: Risk Tolerance: The accumulator strategy is inherently riskier than DCA, especially in a sustained bear market. Are you comfortable increasing your exposure as prices fall? Time Commitment: DCA is largely automated. The accumulator requires more active monitoring and management of limit orders. Do you have the time and willingness for this? Market Outlook: The accumulator performed well since 2023 because there were dips to buy within an overall bullish trend. Would it perform as well in a prolonged, severe bear market where prices simply continue to fall? Likely not. Capital Availability: The accumulator strategy often implies having capital ready to deploy when dips occur, which might be different from the fixed schedule of DCA. For many investors, especially those new to the space or preferring a hands-off approach, DCA Bitcoin remains a robust and sensible long-term Bitcoin investment strategy . It removes emotion and ensures participation in market growth over time, even if it might not capture the absolute best entry points during volatile periods. However, for investors with a higher risk tolerance, more experience, and the time to actively manage their positions, the accumulator strategy, particularly informed by insights like the Orbit Markets analysis , could be a powerful tool to potentially enhance returns by strategically buying dips. Some investors might even consider a hybrid approach, combining elements of both. Conclusion: Beyond DCA for Enhanced Returns? The analysis from Orbit Markets provides valuable insight, highlighting that for the specific market conditions experienced since 2023, the accumulator strategy significantly outperformed the popular DCA method for Bitcoin investors, delivering substantially higher returns over 3 and 12 months. This finding underscores that while DCA is a solid foundation for a crypto investment plan, exploring and understanding alternative strategies like the Accumulator strategy can potentially lead to enhanced performance, especially in volatile markets. Ultimately, the choice of Bitcoin investment strategy should align with your personal financial goals, risk profile, and market understanding. The Orbit Markets analysis serves as a reminder that staying informed about different approaches and their performance under varying market conditions is key to making educated investment decisions in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.

The Israeli hacking group Predatory Sparrow is claiming responsibility for the cyberattack against Iran’s Bank Sepah that has left customers unable to access their funds, reports Axios. Local Iranian news has reported that customers’ cards are completely unusable, the mobile app and digital services are down, and most ATMs are out of cash. Said one man in Tehran, the country’s capital, “I’ve visited ten ATMs today… None had any cash.” The hacker group, which publicly goes by the Farsi translation of its name, Gonjeshke Darande, says on the social media platform X that it deleted the state-owned banking system’s data. “Bank Sepah was an institution that circumvented international sanctions and used the people of Iran’s money to finance the regime’s terrorist proxies, its ballistic missile program and its military nuclear program. This is what happens to institutions dedicated to maintaining the dictator’s terrorist fantasies.” Bank Sepah has not responded to the incident at time of writing. Axios says it was unable to immediately verify the hackers’ claims. The same Israeli hacker group is also claiming responsibility for an attack on the Iranian crypto exchange Nobitex. On-chain investigator ZachXBT says in a Telegram post that the hackers appear to have stolen at least $81.7 million in digital assets from the platform. “The Iranian crypto exchange ‘Nobitex’ appears to have been exploited for $81.7M on Tron, Bitcoin, Doge, and EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) chains after suspicious outflows were observed from many wallets linked to them… The funds were essentially burned permanently and cannot be touched unless stablecoin issuers were to reissue the centralized stablecoins.” In a post on the social media platform X, Nobitex has confirmed that a security breach occurred. “Immediately upon detection, all access was suspended and our internal security teams are closely investigating the extent of the incident. We would like to remind you that users’ assets are completely secure according to cold storage standards, and the above incident only affected a portion of the assets in hot wallets. Nobitex accepts full responsibility for this incident and assures users that all damages will be compensated through the insurance fund and Nobitex resources.

2025-06-18T18:04:01,"Bitcoin Price Unfazed as US Federal Reserve Announces Decision on Interest Rates","The United States Federal Reserve decided to keep general interest rates unchanged at 4.25% to 4.5% – a move that was largely expected by the broader market. In fact, as CryptoPotato reported yesterday, more than 98% of the volume on Polymarket regarding potential rate cuts was betting on “no change.” As a reminder, the odds are are considerably higher for the Fed’s decision during September’s FOMC meeting when 41% of the traders expect the institution to cut rates by 25 basis points. The Fed’s decision comes amid mounting political pressure as President Donald Trump continues with his questionable rhetoric calling Chairman Jerome Powell “stupid,” earlier today. The Fed holds rates steady. No surprises from the FOMC. All eyes now on Powell’s speech in 30 minutes for signs of easing. Meanwhile, Trump: “Am I allowed to appoint myself head of the Fed?” “I’d do a much better job than Powell.” pic.twitter.com/Trn9dQI7TL — CryptoPotato Official (@Crypto_Potato) June 18, 2025 “So, we have a stupid person.

2025-06-18T18:01:07,"BREAKING: FED Releases Critical Interest Rate Decision – Here Are the Details and Bitcoin’s First Reaction","The FED finally announced its interest rate decision after its two-day monetary policy meeting. The FED kept interest rates steady. Market expectations were that the institution would keep its policy rate steady. However, economic indicators and political uncertainties make it necessary to give clearer messages about the coming period. The Fed has held interest rates steady at around 4.4% since January. Officials have been cautious about cutting rates, saying they want to see the impact of tariffs and other major economic policies implemented by President Donald Trump. Economists expect the FED to cut interest rates this year. According to this forecast, the most important factor triggering interest rate cuts will be the increase in unemployment. Wells Fargo Chief Economist Jay Bryson said, “The FED will start cutting interest rates in the second half of the year as tariffs put pressure on growth and unemployment increases.” Related News: Whales Are Active Today: Heavy Buying and Selling in Altcoins - Here Are the Data Rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are deepening economic uncertainties. It is stated that if the Trump administration’s policies suppress consumer spending and reduce corporate profits, there could be serious weakening in the labor market. This could be a signal for the Fed to cut interest rates in line with its “maximum employment” goal in its mission statement. The Fed’s new economic projections, to be released today, are expected to reflect expectations of at least one interest rate cut this year. However, these potential steps are unlikely to please President Trump, who has criticized the failure to cut interest rates already.

2025-06-18T18:00:11,"Shiba Inu Payment Breakthrough: Amore Smiles Now Accepts SHIB, BTC, ETH","BitcoinWorld Shiba Inu Payment Breakthrough: Amore Smiles Now Accepts SHIB, BTC, ETH In a move signaling the growing integration of digital assets into traditional commerce, Michigan-based dental supply company Amore Smiles has announced it will now accept crypto payments for its products. This isn’t just about adding another payment option; it’s a step that embraces the future of finance and potentially expands their reach in the global market. What Does This Mean for **Accept Crypto Payments**? The decision by Amore Smiles to accept crypto payments highlights a significant trend we’re seeing across various industries. While early adopters were often tech companies or online retailers, we are increasingly seeing businesses rooted in more traditional sectors, like healthcare supply, recognize the potential of digital currencies. This isn’t just about Bitcoin or Ethereum anymore; the inclusion of Shiba Inu, a cryptocurrency that started with a meme, shows a broader acceptance of the diverse crypto landscape. For businesses considering accepting crypto, Amore Smiles provides a compelling example. They operate globally, exporting to over 200 countries, which means they understand the complexities of international transactions. Adding crypto can potentially streamline these processes, reduce fees, and open doors to customers in regions where traditional payment methods might be less accessible or more expensive. This move contributes to the overall legitimacy and adoption of cryptocurrencies as viable forms of payment. Every business, large or small, that decides to accept crypto payments helps build the infrastructure and user confidence needed for wider adoption. Why **Shiba Inu Payment**? The Community’s Role Perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of Amore Smiles’ announcement is the inclusion of Shiba Inu (SHIB) alongside established giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The rise of SHIB has been phenomenal, driven largely by its passionate and active community. Accepting a Shiba Inu payment is more than just adding a token; it’s tapping into this vibrant community base. While initially seen as a meme coin, SHIB has been working to build utility within its ecosystem, including decentralized exchanges and layer-2 scaling solutions. Businesses accepting SHIB payments are betting on the continued growth and loyalty of the Shib Army. For a company like Amore Smiles, offering a Shiba Inu payment option could attract customers specifically interested in using their SHIB holdings for real-world goods and services, potentially creating a new customer segment. It also sends a message that Amore Smiles is forward-thinking and willing to embrace newer, community-driven digital assets, not just the market leaders. This can generate significant positive buzz within the crypto community. The Bedrock: **Bitcoin Payment** and **Ethereum Payment** in Commerce While SHIB’s inclusion is noteworthy, the acceptance of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) provides a solid foundation for Amore Smiles’ crypto payment options. A Bitcoin payment is arguably the most recognized form of cryptocurrency transaction globally. Bitcoin’s status as the first and largest cryptocurrency by market cap makes it a natural choice for any business looking to accept digital assets. Bitcoin offers a decentralized, secure, and relatively fast way to transfer value across borders without intermediaries. For a company exporting to 200+ countries, this is a significant advantage. A Bitcoin payment can bypass traditional banking hours and international transfer delays, potentially speeding up order processing and delivery. Similarly, an Ethereum payment leverages the second-largest cryptocurrency ecosystem. While Ethereum is perhaps best known for its smart contract capabilities, DeFi, and NFTs, ETH is also a widely held and accepted digital currency for payments. Ethereum’s ongoing evolution, particularly its move to Proof-of-Stake, aims to make transactions faster and more energy-efficient, further enhancing its viability as a payment method. Offering both a Bitcoin payment and an Ethereum payment covers the two most prominent and liquid cryptocurrencies, catering to a large segment of the crypto-holding population. This dual approach, combined with SHIB, offers customers significant flexibility. Amore Smiles: A **Business Accepting Crypto** on a Global Scale Amore Smiles’ decision positions them as an early adopter within the dental supply sector. Becoming a business accepting crypto when your peers may not be can create a competitive edge. By facilitating payments in SHIB, BTC, and ETH, they are lowering potential barriers for international customers who may find it easier or cheaper to pay with crypto than through traditional banking channels or credit cards. Think about a dental clinic in a country with high transaction fees for international wires or limited access to certain payment processors. If they can make a Shiba Inu payment , a Bitcoin payment , or an Ethereum payment directly to Amore Smiles, it simplifies their procurement process. This global reach makes Amore Smiles’ move particularly impactful. For any business accepting crypto , especially one operating internationally, integrating a reliable payment gateway is crucial. These services handle the complexities of converting crypto to fiat (if desired), managing wallets, and ensuring secure transactions, often providing plugins for e-commerce platforms. Beyond the Transaction: Amore Smiles and Blockchain for Secure Data The Watcher Guru report also mentions Amore Smiles leveraging blockchain technology for secure data storage. This is a key point that goes beyond just accepting payments. Blockchain’s inherent properties of immutability, transparency (where appropriate), and decentralization make it ideal for securing sensitive information. In the dental supply industry, data could include order histories, shipping manifests, product authenticity records, or even potentially (with proper privacy considerations) information related to product usage or regulatory compliance. Using blockchain for secure data storage can enhance trust, provide an unalterable audit trail, and protect against data tampering. This demonstrates that Amore Smiles isn’t just dabbling in crypto payments as a gimmick; they appear to be exploring the broader potential of blockchain technology to improve their operations and security. This holistic approach strengthens their position as an innovative business accepting crypto . The Upside: Benefits for Businesses **Accepting Crypto** Why are more businesses, like Amore Smiles, choosing to accept crypto payments ? The benefits are numerous and compelling: Expanded Customer Base: Access to a global market of crypto holders, including those who prefer using digital assets or have limited access to traditional banking. Lower Transaction Fees: Cryptocurrency transaction fees can often be significantly lower than credit card processing fees, especially for international payments. Faster Settlements: Crypto transactions can settle much faster than traditional bank transfers, improving cash flow. No Chargebacks: Unlike credit card payments, crypto transactions are generally irreversible, eliminating the risk of chargebacks and associated losses. Innovation and Marketing: Position your business as forward-thinking and tech-savvy, generating positive PR and attracting media attention. Security: When handled correctly (often via reputable payment processors), crypto payments can be highly secure. Potential for Asset Appreciation: Businesses can choose to hold a portion of the received crypto, potentially benefiting from market appreciation (though this also carries risk). Reach Underserved Markets: Serve customers in regions with less developed financial infrastructure. Navigating the Waters: Challenges of **Business Accepting Crypto** While the benefits are clear, becoming a business accepting crypto is not without its challenges. Amore Smiles, like any adopter, would need to consider these factors: Price Volatility: The value of cryptocurrencies can fluctuate dramatically, potentially impacting the fiat value received unless immediately converted. Regulatory Uncertainty: The legal and regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many countries. Tax Implications: Handling crypto can introduce complex tax reporting requirements depending on jurisdiction and how assets are managed (held vs. immediately converted). Technical Complexity: Setting up wallets, integrating payment gateways, and managing transactions requires technical understanding. Security Risks: Wallets can be targeted by hackers, and lost private keys can result in irreversible loss of funds. Customer Education: Some customers may be new to using crypto for payments and might require guidance. Integration: Integrating crypto payment systems with existing accounting and inventory software can be challenging. Making the Leap: Actionable Insights for Your **Business Accepting Crypto** Inspired by Amore Smiles? Here are some steps for other businesses considering accepting crypto: Research: Understand cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and how they apply to your business model. Choose Your Cryptos: Decide which cryptocurrencies to accept based on customer demand, market liquidity, and transaction costs (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, potentially others like SHIB). Select a Payment Processor: Services like BitPay, Coinbase Commerce, or others can simplify the process, handle conversions, and manage wallets securely. Understand the Tech: Get familiar with wallets, transaction confirmations, and security best practices. Address Taxes and Regulation: Consult with tax professionals and legal experts to understand your obligations. Educate Your Team: Ensure staff who interact with customers or handle finances understand the new payment option. Communicate with Customers: Clearly explain that you accept crypto and how customers can use it. Start Small (Optional): You might consider rolling out crypto payments gradually or for specific products/services first. The Road Ahead: Future of Crypto in Commerce The move by Amore Smiles is likely just one of many we will see in the coming years. As cryptocurrencies become more mainstream, payment solutions become more user-friendly, and regulatory clarity improves, more businesses will explore accepting digital assets. We might see even wider acceptance of a diverse range of tokens, including community-driven ones like SHIB, alongside the established players. The potential for faster, cheaper, and more inclusive global commerce powered by crypto is immense. Conclusion Amore Smiles’ decision to accept Shiba Inu, Bitcoin, and Ethereum for its dental supplies is a significant step, not just for the company, but for the broader adoption of cryptocurrencies in traditional industries. By embracing digital payments and leveraging blockchain for secure data, they are positioning themselves at the forefront of innovation in the dental supply sector. This move highlights the growing viability of crypto as a payment method and provides a valuable case study for other businesses considering making the leap into the world of digital assets.

The U.K. is looking to formulate rules that are more on the restrictive side, said David Bailey, the executive director of prudential policy at the Bank of England, in a speech at Risk Live Europe in London. Bailey suggested the country is likely to encourage banks to have a low exposure to crypto. ""There are also examples where it might be more appropriate to start more towards the restrictive end of the spectrum, while evidence is gathered to see if standards can be relaxed over time,"" Bailey said. ""The prudential treatment of banks’ exposures to cryptoassets, and specifically those with features associated with heightened price volatility and where investors could lose the entirety of their investment, is an example in this space."" The nation is seeking to implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's disclosure framework for banks' exposure to crypto. This framework must be put in place by the start of 2026 to help nations evaluate risks, the committee said. The Committee also proposed rules that banks should limit exposure to crypto like bitcoin to 1%. The U.K.'s plans will be ""informed"" by the standards developed by the Basel Committee, Bailey said. Nations have been looking to ensure they can maintain financial stability despite crypto volatility by monitoring how interlinked banks are to crypto, especially following the 2023 collapses of Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate Bank which both had crypto clients. The U.K.'s prudential crypto rules will come at a time where the country's other financial regulator — the Financial Conduct Authority — is set to implement a new regime for crypto.

2025-06-18T17:52:14,"Interview | HIVE CFO: Hydro-cooled mining and AI cloud give us an edge post-halving","As Bitcoin mining enters a new chapter post-halving, HIVE Digital Technologies is taking a measured, ambitious approach to growth. In this interview, Darcy Daubaras, CFO of HIVE, offers an inside look at how the company plans to scale its hashrate to 25 EH/s by the end of 2025 while sticking to its no-debt philosophy and keeping a close eye on operational discipline. Daubaras explains how HIVE is balancing speed with sustainability. It is interesting to note that HIVE’s story isn’t just about mining . The company has also made an early move into AI and high-performance cloud services, using its green data centers to diversify beyond crypto and build long-term resilience. Daubaras explains how this dual focus between Bitcoin ( BTC ) and computing gives HIVE a competitive edge, especially as ESG concerns and energy costs dictate the winners and losers in the mining industry. For investors and industry watchers, it’s a rare glimpse into how one of the sector’s most forward-thinking firms is positioning itself for the future. Below is the complete Q&A with Darcy Daubaras. crypto.news: HIVE is undertaking a massive hashrate expansion with the goal of 25 EH/s by late 2025. You already hit 10 EH/s as of May. Your goal still represents a further increase of around 2.5x in capacity. What are the biggest execution risks in scaling up this rapidly, and how are you managing these challenges to ensure you meet your 25 EH/s goal on time? DD: Scaling to 25 EH/s is an ambitious objective, but we are firmly on track. However, rapid expansion at this scale naturally introduces execution risks, including global supply chain volatility, hardware logistics, and tight construction timelines. We actively manage these risks through a combination of disciplined project planning, phased deployments, and strong local execution. Our partnerships with trusted vendors and our local presence at each site provide us with critical visibility and control at every stage of the buildout. In Paraguay, for instance, our operations are led by Country President Gabriel Lamas, a seasoned electrical engineer with over two decades of experience in large-scale infrastructure and energy projects throughout Latin America. Under his guidance, we are constructing high-performance, hydro-powered data centres designed for long-term reliability, grid efficiency, and sustainability. His deep understanding of energy systems ensures that as we scale in South America, we are not just growing quickly, but with precision and resilience. CN: Are there any financing challenges to scaling your operation, considering your ‘no debt’ stance? Will you deploy more of your Bitcoin treasury or raise capital if needed, or can HIVE continue working towards its goals through operational cash flow? Speaking of which, how do you decide when to hold mined BTC versus when to liquidate or use it for corporate needs? DD: Using Bitcoin from our treasury to fund growth gives us flexibility without incurring debt; however, it requires disciplined timing and robust treasury management. Given Bitcoin’s historical volatility, we are cautious to structure transactions that provide downside protection and potential buybacks. We only deploy BTC when it presents clear, accretive growth. Our goal is always to safeguard long-term upside while responsibly funding accretive expansion. CN: HIVE has aggressively invested in next-gen mining hardware, such as the S21+ Hydro ASICs for your fleet. I’m not going to pretend to understand what is happening ‘under the hood’, but perhaps you can explain how these state-of-the-art, hydro-cooled machines give HIVE an edge over competitors in terms of performance or unit economics? Are these tools sufficient for your needs out of the box or do you need to explore further in-house optimization to improve efficiency and hash rate density? DD: The S21+ Hydro ASICs represent a major leap forward in mining efficiency, and we’ve made a deliberate bet on this technology as a cornerstone of our next growth phase. Hydro-cooled ASIC miners are environmentally responsible due to their superior energy efficiency and reduced environmental impact. Liquid cooling requires less energy than traditional air systems, lowering total site power consumption and improving power usage effectiveness.. These systems also eliminate high-speed fans, cutting noise pollution and making them more suitable for community integration. The stable thermal environment extends equipment life, reducing electronic waste. Additionally, hydro-cooled setups are often paired with renewable energy sources like hydropower, further minimizing carbon footprint. Together, these factors make hydro-cooled miners a more sustainable choice for responsible Bitcoin mining operations. At HIVE, we see hardware as just one part of the equation. It’s how you deploy, tune, and manage that hardware, especially at scale, that really sets leaders apart. As such, we’ve developed proprietary firmware optimizations that fine-tune voltage and frequency settings to push performance beyond factory specifications while maintaining energy efficiency. CN: HIVE reported an approximate 35% gross operating margin in fiscal 2024. However, since the 2024 halving, industry economics have obviously tightened while network difficulty is at an all-time high. With that said, what margin profile do you expect for HIVE in the coming quarters or full fiscal year? DD: Sustainability throughout all market cycles is a core aspect of our strategy. At a Bitcoin price of $120K, our gross mining margin is roughly 65%, with a breakeven hash price close to $20. Nevertheless, we operate with one of the most streamlined teams in the industry, maintain the lowest G&A expenses among our peers, and are highly disciplined in our capital allocation. This efficiency keeps our cost structure competitive, enabling us to stay profitable even if Bitcoin falls below $100K. CN: How does your diversification into GPU cloud services or AI computing complement your core Bitcoin mining business, or is this just a natural expansion? Do you envision HIVE’s green data centers eventually servicing a larger share of AI, machine learning, or other cloud workloads as a hedge against crypto cycles, and can this become a significant revenue stream or competitive advantage for HIVE in the long run? DD: Our entry into HPC and AI cloud services isn’t a pivot. In fact, HIVE was the first Bitcoin miner to launch an AI strategy, seizing the opportunity right after Ethereum transitioned to proof-of-stake. We repurposed our GPU infrastructure early and deliberately, offering high-performance, sovereign AI compute to enterprises, research institutions, and other mission-critical users. That foresight is paying off as BUZZ HPC is already reaching revenue milestones ahead of schedule. As AI and data centre infrastructure increasingly become national security priorities, we see enormous tailwinds driving demand for trusted, green compute. This is also smart risk management. When crypto markets soften, AI compute demand remains robust. Over time, we expect our green data centres to power both the blockchain and AI economies. That dual engine gives HIVE a sustainable competitive advantage and a pathway to long-term, diversified revenue growth. CN: How are you preparing for potential downturns or unexpected shocks in the Bitcoin market? Do you utilize any hedging strategies to protect against price swings, or is HIVE essentially fully exposed to Bitcoin with confidence that low costs and a strong balance sheet will carry you through any bear market? Or, do you just HODL and hope for the best? DD: Our belief in the long-term value of the Bitcoin network is central to our strategy. However, we manage risk through structural advantages such as minimal debt, low operating costs, and flexible treasury management. Our fleet is designed to endure downturns with discipline. We may monetize BTC when it facilitates accretive growth, but we’re not forced sellers. Our philosophy is straightforward: strong balance sheet, efficient operations, and long-term conviction. CN: The Bitcoin mining sector as a whole is under increasing ESG scrutiny from regulators, environmental groups, and even investors concerned about energy consumption and carbon emissions. We’ve seen some jurisdictions consider moratoriums or bans on mining (Paraguay’s debate being one example), and miners are now keen to prove their climate credentials. In your view, is the industry doing enough to address these concerns? How is HIVE contributing to improving the narrative around Bitcoin mining’s environmental impact? DD: The ESG debate in mining is valid, but it often lacks nuance. HIVE has always been a renewable-first miner. Since our inception, we’ve prioritized green energy in Iceland, Sweden, Canada, and now Paraguay. We believe the industry must lead with transparency, accurate emissions data, and proactive grid integration. We’re also working to shift the narrative: Bitcoin mining can provide a net benefit to energy systems by stabilizing grids, monetizing stranded power, and supporting local communities. At HIVE, we support that claim with action and investment. CN: Do you anticipate a shakeout ahead, where higher-cost or over-leveraged miners struggle and network growth slows? How does a company like HIVE position itself in this scenario? Are you preparing to capture market share from potential drop-outs, or even to acquire assets/equipment from distressed miners? DD: A shakeout is not only likely, but also healthy. The post-halving landscape has separated efficient operators from the rest, and HIVE is uniquely positioned to benefit. We run lean, avoid leverage, and operate at scale using renewable power. If distressed assets enter the market, we’ll be opportunistic, but only if they meet our stringent ROI and ESG criteria. This is a cycle where resilience prevails, and that’s where we’ve focused our strategy. CN: How does HIVE approach site selection and energy procurement? With your large Paraguay hydro projects, it seems you’ve locked in relatively low-cost, renewable power. Are you looking at other geographies with cheap power for future expansion, or do you feel your current mix already provides a competitive enough energy cost profile? DD: Energy is crucial in mining, and we’re precise in how we assess jurisdictions. We seek low-cost renewable energy, regulatory stability, and grid reliability. Paraguay meets all these criteria and more, which is why it’s now a key part of our global fleet. However, we’re not pausing here. We’re actively investigating further opportunities, as diversification aids us in mitigating geopolitical and operational risks while securing low-cost energy for the long term. CN: Curious as a follow-up from the previous question, if Paraguay is such an ideal location for your operation, why not base 100% of your operation there? What exactly is the benefit of geographical diversification? DD: Paraguay is politically stable and offers abundant hydropower, which is why we chose to invest there. However, like any jurisdiction, risks exist. These include regulatory changes, limitations in grid infrastructure, and regional trade dynamics. We have built strong relationships with the government and work closely with local utilities to ensure alignment. By investing in grid upgrades and developing local talent, we are helping to build long-term resilience into our operations. Nonetheless, our goal is global resilience; while Paraguay is our flagship, our operational playbook remains multi-site and multi-country. CN: Some investors see (Micro)Strategy primarily as a proxy for Bitcoin exposure rather than a software company. Given that HIVE also holds BTC on its balance sheet and now runs data centers and HPC operations, how do you want investors to view HIVE? Are you basically one part miner, one part digital asset infrastructure play, or a de facto Bitcoin ETF? Do you feel the need to market yourself as a more balanced alternative to Strategy’s ‘infinite money glitch’ reputation? DD: HIVE is a new breed of Bitcoin infrastructure company. Long before the latest wave of corporate Bitcoin adopters, HIVE became the first public company to hold BTC on its balance sheet. In many respects, we helped define the Bitcoin treasury model. However, we’re not merely a hashrate story or a BTC proxy. We’re building renewable-powered digital infrastructure with two distinct, complementary monetization layers: Bitcoin mining and high-performance computing. Consider us as a green data centre business operating at the intersection of blockchain and AI. Unlike companies focusing on short-term quarters, HIVE is dedicated to building sustainable infrastructure for decades to come. We’re creating long-term financial and digital sovereignty while providing investors with diversified exposure to both decentralized networks and the compute layer powering the next generation of innovation. CN: Do you think there’s any room for strategic collaboration (or outright acquisitions) between mining firms and treasury-heavy companies like Strategy? Have you been approached by Strategy for any discussions? Or are you too fundamentally different on opposite sides of the Bitcoin ecosystem to create any synergies? DD: We respect what Strategy has built as a treasury-focused BTC vehicle, but our models are fundamentally different. As a traditional Bitcoin miner, we differ from Strategy in that we generate Bitcoin by securing the network through high-performance computing infrastructure. Our business model relies on operational efficiency and energy strategy. In contrast, Strategy is a software company that holds Bitcoin as a treasury asset. They gain exposure through purchases, not production. While both models benefit from Bitcoin appreciation, miners actively contribute to the ecosystem, whereas Strategy is primarily a strategic investor.. While we haven’t had direct discussions with them to date, we’re always open to exploring strategic partnerships if they create value for shareholders and align with our ethos of operational discipline.",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/interview-hive-cfo-hydro-cooled-mining-and-ai-cloud-give-us-an-edge-post-halving/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION","Interviews|Bitcoin|Mining",cryptocompare

2025-06-18T17:50:11,"Iran US Tension: Khamenei Issues Unyielding Warning on War and Peace","BitcoinWorld Iran US Tension: Khamenei Issues Unyielding Warning on War and Peace Geopolitical tremors can send significant waves through global financial markets, and the world of cryptocurrency is certainly not immune. When major players on the international stage issue strong statements, investors everywhere pay attention. The latest development comes from Iran, where Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has delivered a potent message regarding the country’s stance on its relationship with the United States. This statement, reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, underscores the ongoing Iran US tension and adds another layer to the complex global security landscape. Understanding the Latest Iran US Tension The core of the recent news is a direct and unequivocal declaration from Iran’s highest authority. According to reports, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stated clearly that Iran will not accept an imposed peace or war. This isn’t just diplomatic rhetoric; it signals a firm position against external pressure, whether it’s forcing a resolution or instigating conflict. Furthermore, he issued a stark warning: any attack by the United States will face serious and irreversible consequences. This Khamenei statement is a significant indicator of the current state of relations between the two nations, which have been strained for decades, marked by periods of heightened tension and proxy conflicts in the Middle East. Understanding the context is key. The relationship between Iran and the United States involves a multitude of complex issues, including Iran’s nuclear program, sanctions, regional influence, and maritime security. Statements like this often come during periods where diplomatic efforts are stalled or perceived threats are high. Khamenei’s remarks can be interpreted as a deterrent message, aiming to dissuade potential military action or coercive diplomatic tactics by highlighting the potential costs. How Khamenei’s Statement Amplifies Geopolitical Risk Anytime a major regional power like Iran issues such a strong warning directed at a global superpower like the United States, it immediately heightens geopolitical risk . Geopolitical risk refers to the possibility that political events will affect a market. This can include wars, terrorist attacks, or even just increased political instability and diplomatic friction between nations. Khamenei’s declaration that Iran will not accept an ‘imposed peace or war’ suggests a refusal to be dictated to, implying that any external attempt to force a specific outcome could be met with resistance. The mention of ‘serious and irreversible consequences’ in response to a US attack is particularly significant. This vague but menacing phrase leaves room for interpretation, potentially encompassing a range of retaliatory actions, from cyberattacks to targeting shipping lanes, proxy forces, or even direct military engagement. Such uncertainty is precisely what drives up geopolitical risk premiums in markets. Investors dislike uncertainty, and the prospect of escalation in a volatile region like the Middle East is a major source of concern. Key aspects of amplified geopolitical risk: Increased Uncertainty: The lack of clarity on what ‘serious and irreversible consequences’ entails creates significant market unease. Potential for Disruption: Conflict in the Middle East can disrupt oil supplies, shipping routes, and regional stability, impacting global trade and economies. Policy Reactions: Governments may impose new sanctions or take other defensive/offensive measures, further altering the economic and political landscape. Investor Sentiment: Fear and risk aversion can lead to capital flight from riskier assets to perceived safe havens. Potential Crypto Market Impact of Middle East Conflict So, what does heightened Middle East conflict potential mean for the dynamic world of cryptocurrency? The connection might not be immediately obvious to everyone, but geopolitical events have shown a tangible impact on crypto markets, particularly Bitcoin (BTC). Here’s how the increased geopolitical risk stemming from the Iran US tension could affect the crypto market: 1. Bitcoin as a ‘Safe Haven’ Narrative: During times of traditional market uncertainty and geopolitical instability, Bitcoin has sometimes been framed as a digital ‘safe haven’ asset, similar to gold. The argument is that because it is decentralized, not controlled by any single government, and operates on a global network, it might be seen as a store of value when national currencies or traditional banking systems seem vulnerable. When tensions rise, some investors might move a portion of their wealth into Bitcoin, potentially increasing demand and price. However, this narrative is still debated, and Bitcoin’s volatility means it doesn’t always act as a reliable safe haven. 2. Increased Volatility: Crypto markets are known for their volatility, and major global events tend to amplify this. News of potential conflict or escalating tensions can lead to sharp price swings as traders react to the headlines. This presents both opportunities and significant risks for investors. 3. Capital Flows: If regional instability leads to capital controls or economic uncertainty in affected areas, there might be increased interest in cryptocurrencies as a way to move or preserve wealth outside traditional systems. This was observed, for example, in countries experiencing hyperinflation or political turmoil. 4. Impact on Global Liquidity: Major geopolitical events can influence global liquidity and investor risk appetite. If traditional markets face significant sell-offs due to fear, this can sometimes spill over into crypto, as investors might sell any liquid asset to cover losses or reduce overall exposure to risk. It’s important to note that the crypto market is influenced by many factors, and geopolitical events are just one piece of the puzzle. However, a significant escalation in the Middle East could certainly become a dominant factor in market movements for a period. Navigating Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for the Crypto Investor Given the potential for heightened geopolitical risk and its possible impact on the crypto market impact , what steps can investors take? While no one can predict market movements with certainty, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch not only on crypto news but also on major global geopolitical developments, particularly those involving the Iran US tension and the broader Middle East conflict situation. Reliable news sources (like the one reporting the Khamenei statement ) are crucial. Evaluate Your Risk Tolerance: Understand that periods of high geopolitical risk often mean increased market volatility. Ensure your investment portfolio aligns with your comfort level regarding potential price swings. Consider Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying across different cryptocurrencies, and potentially across different asset classes, can help mitigate risk. Think Long-Term: Trying to time the market based on unpredictable geopolitical events is extremely difficult. For many investors, focusing on their long-term investment strategy is often more prudent than reacting impulsively to short-term news. Secure Your Assets: In times of global uncertainty, the security of your digital assets is paramount. Ensure you are using strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and consider hardware wallets for significant holdings. Avoid Leverage if Unsure: Trading with leverage during volatile periods amplified by geopolitical risk can lead to rapid and substantial losses. This is not financial advice, but rather general guidance on approaching markets during uncertain times. The key is to be prepared, informed, and measured in your approach. Conclusion: Watching the Horizon Supreme Leader Khamenei’s firm declaration that Iran will not accept an imposed peace or war, coupled with the warning of serious consequences for any US attack, is a significant statement that highlights the enduring Iran US tension . This adds a layer of complexity to the global geopolitical landscape and undeniably increases geopolitical risk , particularly concerning potential Middle East conflict . While the direct link between these political statements and the crypto market impact might seem indirect, history shows that major global uncertainties can influence investor behavior and market dynamics, sometimes pushing assets like Bitcoin into the spotlight as potential, albeit volatile, safe havens. The Khamenei statement serves as a reminder that external factors can play a significant role in market sentiment. As the situation develops, market participants will be closely watching for any signs of escalation or de-escalation. For those involved in cryptocurrency, staying informed about both geopolitical developments and market reactions is essential for navigating the potential volatility that such high-stakes international relations can introduce.

2025-06-18T17:40:11,"ANAP Bitcoin Purchase: Japanese Fashion Giant Accelerates Bold Crypto Strategy","BitcoinWorld ANAP Bitcoin Purchase: Japanese Fashion Giant Accelerates Bold Crypto Strategy In a move turning heads in both the fashion and finance worlds, Japanese fashion company ANAP Holdings recently announced a substantial increase in its Bitcoin (BTC) reserves. This latest acquisition signals a growing trend of companies looking to integrate digital assets into their treasury strategies, and ANAP is certainly making a bold statement. ANAP Bitcoin Purchase: What Are the Details? According to a press release issued on June 18th, ANAP Holdings completed the purchase of an additional 31.2108 Bitcoin. This acquisition came at a cost of 479.95 million yen, which translates to approximately $3.31 million USD at the time of the announcement. This isn’t ANAP’s first foray into the crypto market. With this latest buy, their total Bitcoin holdings have grown significantly. The company now holds a cumulative 184.6735 BTC. The total investment into these Bitcoin reserves stands at around 2.75 billion yen, roughly equivalent to $18.98 million USD. What’s even more intriguing is ANAP’s stated ambition. Earlier reports indicated the company’s intention to acquire a substantial amount of Bitcoin, setting a target of accumulating north of 1,000 BTC by August. This recent purchase brings them closer to that ambitious goal, demonstrating a clear commitment to their digital asset strategy. Why is a Fashion Brand Investing in Bitcoin? Exploring the Fashion Brand Bitcoin Trend You might be wondering why a company primarily known for fashion retail is diving deep into cryptocurrency. The decision by ANAP Holdings reflects a broader shift seen across various industries, where companies are exploring alternatives for their corporate treasuries beyond traditional cash reserves and low-yield investments. Several factors could be driving this Fashion brand Bitcoin adoption: Store of Value: Bitcoin is often seen as a potential hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, particularly in uncertain economic times. Companies holding large cash reserves see their purchasing power erode over time. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin can help diversify the company’s balance sheet, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Potential for Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term growth potential, offering the possibility of substantial returns on investment. Innovation and Brand Image: For a fashion brand, embracing a cutting-edge technology like Bitcoin could also align with an innovative brand image and potentially appeal to a tech-savvy customer base. ANAP’s move is a notable example of how companies outside the traditional finance or tech sectors are seriously considering and executing Fashion brand Bitcoin strategies. Japan Corporate Bitcoin: Is the Trend Picking Up Speed? ANAP Holdings operates within Japan, a country with a relatively developed regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies compared to some other nations. While not as prominent in corporate Bitcoin holdings as, say, the United States with companies like MicroStrategy, there are signs of increasing interest in Japan corporate Bitcoin adoption. Japan has long been a significant market for cryptocurrency trading and innovation. The regulatory clarity, though evolving, provides a foundation for companies to consider digital assets. ANAP’s significant purchase could potentially inspire other Japanese corporations to explore similar strategies, contributing to a broader trend of Japan corporate Bitcoin accumulation. This development aligns with a global movement towards greater Bitcoin institutional adoption . As more public and private companies allocate portions of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin, it lends further legitimacy to the asset class and can influence market dynamics. Understanding the ANAP Holdings BTC Strategy: Benefits and Risks ANAP Holdings’ decision to build a substantial ANAP Holdings BTC reserve comes with potential upsides and inherent risks. It’s important to look at both sides of the coin. Potential Benefits: Asset Growth: If Bitcoin’s value appreciates, ANAP’s balance sheet could see significant gains. Inflation Hedge: Protects the value of corporate reserves against potential inflation of the Japanese Yen. First-Mover Advantage (in Japan): Being an early, prominent corporate holder in Japan could provide a unique position. Attracting Talent/Customers: Could appeal to a younger, crypto-aware demographic. Potential Risks: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for dramatic price swings, which could negatively impact the company’s financial statements in the short term. Regulatory Changes: Future regulatory shifts in Japan or globally could affect the holding or trading of Bitcoin. Security Risks: Holding significant amounts of crypto requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss. Accounting Treatment: Accounting for cryptocurrency holdings can be complex and subject to changing standards. The company is clearly betting that the long-term benefits outweigh the short-term volatility and risks associated with their ANAP Holdings BTC strategy. Broader Implications: The Rise of Bitcoin Institutional Adoption ANAP’s move is a piece of a much larger puzzle: the increasing trend of Bitcoin institutional adoption . While companies like MicroStrategy, which holds over 200,000 BTC, are often cited as pioneers, the list of corporations adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets continues to grow. This trend signifies a maturation of the Bitcoin market. It’s moving beyond just individual investors and speculative trading to become a recognized, albeit still volatile, asset class for corporate treasuries and large institutions. The motivations are often similar: seeking alternatives to low-yield cash, hedging against macroeconomic uncertainty, and recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a digital store of value. The increasing participation of institutions and corporations like ANAP can have several effects on the market, including: Potentially increasing demand and reducing circulating supply available on exchanges. Adding a layer of stability as institutional holders often have longer investment horizons than retail traders. Enhancing the credibility and mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin. What Does This Mean for Investors? For individual investors watching the market, corporate moves like ANAP’s provide interesting signals. They suggest that sophisticated financial teams within traditional companies are increasingly comfortable with Bitcoin as a legitimate asset. It doesn’t necessarily mean everyone should rush out and buy Bitcoin, but it does highlight the growing acceptance and strategic thinking around digital assets in the corporate world. It reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is being viewed not just as a speculative gamble, but as a potential long-term treasury asset. Conclusion ANAP Holdings’ recent ANAP Bitcoin purchase is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a clear indicator of their strategic direction and belief in the future role of digital assets. By significantly increasing their Bitcoin reserves and setting an ambitious target of over 1,000 BTC, the Japanese fashion giant is positioning itself within the growing wave of Bitcoin institutional adoption . This development in Japan corporate Bitcoin strategy by a prominent Fashion brand Bitcoin holder like ANAP underscores the evolving landscape where companies from diverse sectors are exploring and implementing digital asset strategies. While risks remain due to volatility, the move highlights the potential benefits companies see in holding Bitcoin as part of a modern treasury management approach.

2025-06-18T17:30:20,"Buy Bitcoin Now? Not Yet—Analyst Says Time Holds The Key","In a post on June 17, prominent crypto strategist Astronomer (@astronomer_zero) outlined his high-conviction roadmap for Bitcoin’s next major breakout, emphasizing that timing—not just price—is the most critical factor for those still on the sidelines. Despite projecting a continuation of the broader uptrend that began at $18,000 in 2023, Astronomer warned that jumping in prematurely could blunt the risk-reward ratio of the next leg. “Planning to buy now into BTC is expected to net you a move of over 70% in a short period of time,” he wrote. “But the closer we get to those 10 weeks, confirmed with price action, the closer BTC is to breaking out.” Buy Bitcoin Now? His primary thesis: Bitcoin’s breakout will not occur before June 30, and any significant move is statistically more likely after that date. This aligns with what he calls one of the “most ancient crypto mechanics”—Bitcoin moves first, and altcoins follow. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Crash As War Tensions Mount In Middle East Astronomer’s roadmap presents a tiered accumulation strategy rooted in probabilistic support zones. “Upon statistical analysis, the expected close before going up only is around $103k,” he wrote. “Probably a good level to start getting involved. The expected level to be reached based on all prior signals (lowest wick) is $96k. Probably a good level to buy heavy if given. […] And finally, the expected lowest close is $90k. Probably a good level to allocate (almost) all your dry powder.” But beyond the price levels, Astronomer places stronger emphasis on timing: “If the price doesn’t go as deep into the $90’s—which I don’t think is very likely—I expect June to close between $95-110k and not go much lower. Then I’d buy more and more the closer we get to those 10 weeks regardless of the price. Time is more important than price.” He also pointed to structural market dynamics supporting his thesis, including a bullish spot-to-perpetual rotation: “The order books start to rotate towards green into spot, red into perps (aggressive shorts, aggressive spot buys), simply visible with the increasing spot premiums.” Adding to the signal strength is a recent weekly hash ribbon print—“one that never failed,” he noted. Related Reading: $150,000 Bitcoin Is In Play—Unless This One Macro Metric Snaps Astronomer further offered guidance for navigating altcoins, advising traders to wait for the breakout rather than attempting to catch falling knives. “Buying alts when BTC breaks out […] is smarter than trying to knife catch them. To eliminate the drawdown and reap the upside rewards.” Summarizing his plan, he said, “If I was sidelined, I’d look to buy below $103k and as much as possible as close to $90k as possible. And the closer we get to those 10 weeks, confirmed with price action, the more confident I become.” Astronomer’s final message underscores that his bullish stance hasn’t changed since the flip at $18K: “No top being in yet, until we reach at least 170k+. That is the plan.” And for those still unsure? He offers a blunt reminder: “This post is indeed on the backbone of our overall bull market masterplan. Good information if you want to make money—even if you’re sidelined, holding, or want to top up your bags.” At press time, BTC traded at $105,094.

2025-06-18T17:25:24,"Solana holding key support: breakout likely if bulls step in","Solana is sitting on a critical support level following a period of muted volatility and sideways consolidation. With multiple technical confluences now in play, the market appears primed for a decisive breakout,or breakdown. The current structure suggests that price is coiling, and the next move could mark a major directional shift. Solana ( SOL ) has shown signs of hesitation, yet the support zone continues to hold firm. This combination often precedes a volatility expansion, and Solana is approaching that inflection point. Traders should be watching closely, as the resolution of this range will offer clarity on the next trend direction. Key technical points, VWAP Support: The VWAP anchored from the cycle low is acting as dynamic support under current price action. 143 Daily Support: A high time frame level that has repeatedly held, providing strong market structure. Swing Low Structure: Price is respecting a cluster of key swing lows, forming a significant demand area SOLUSDT (4H), Source: Trading view. From a technical standpoint, Solana’s current chart positioning is notable. The anchored VWAP from the cycle low is sitting directly below current price and aligns with the 143 daily support level, creating a strong confluence zone. Additionally, multiple prior swing lows form a local demand cluster, suggesting this area has attracted buyers in the past. Despite this, price remains in no man’s land. Solana has not demonstrated impulsive follow-through in either direction. A decisive breakout above the current range highs could spark a run toward the next major resistance near the $170 region. Conversely, a failure to hold this support could trigger a liquidity sweep below, exposing the asset to a deeper pullback before any recovery attempt. You might also like: Coinbase Derivatives to adopt USDC as collateral for U.S. futures trading It’s also worth noting the lack of volume accompanying recent moves. Without meaningful participation, any breakout risks becoming a false move or weak trend extension. Traders should exercise caution and wait for confirmation through volume expansion and structural breaks before committing to directional setups. What to expect in the coming price action As long as Solana holds above this high-confluence support zone, the probability of a bounce remains slightly elevated. However, in the absence of a strong reaction or breakout, the range may persist. A breakdown below this level would shift bias to the downside, targeting lower support zones.

This shift comes as trade tensions rise once again under President Donald Trump’s renewed tariff policies. These new tariffs push companies to rethink how and where they make and ship technology products, especially in the crypto industry. Bitcoin Miners Makes A Strategic Move to Avoid Tariffs Companies’ decisions are primarily driven by the growing costs of business across borders. By building mining rigs inside the U.S., these firms aim to avoid extra fees caused by tariffs on foreign-made tech goods. Bitmain, the largest of the three, has already started production in the U.S .,just after President Trump won the 2024 election. Canaan is not far behind. One of its executives recently confirmed that the company is testing early-stage production in the U.S. This is to see if the move is practical over time. Meanwhile, MicroBT has announced a localization plan to reduce its exposure to tariffs and maintain access to the U.S. market. Chinese Bitcoin Miners’ Firms Move May Stir U.S. Security Fears Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT produce over 90% of all Bitcoin mining machines worldwide. These machines are designed to solve complex math problems that power and keep the Bitcoin network secure. These companies ensure they stay competitive by shifting part of their operations to the U.S.. Even as global trade rules become more complex, this shift could help with costs and bring new challenges. Chinese firms operating in U.S. tech spaces may raise national security concerns. This is especially true given the past political tensions between the two countries. U.S. regulators have a history of being cautious about Chinese involvement in critical technology infrastructure. In January, two prominent U.S. lawmakers questioned the Treasury Department for details after a Chinese state-sponsored hacking group breached U.S. Treasury systems , compromising certain unclassified documents. America’s Role in Bitcoin Mining Grows The move also reflects a bigger change in where Bitcoin mining power is located. New data shows that the U.S. quickly becoming the world leader in industrial Bitcoin mining. On June 17, VanEck’s Mathew Sigel shared research showing that U.S.-listed miners make up 31.6% of the global Bitcoin hashrate. Hashrate is the computing power used to run and secure the Bitcoin network. The higher the hashrate, the more mining activity is taking place. In April 2024, the U.S. share of the hashrate was just 21%. In the last year, that number has grown by nearly 50%. In addition, reports show Bitcoin mining difficulty has slightly dropped after a record high, giving miners brief relief from rising costs and lower rewards.

2025-06-18T17:13:55,"BNB Hits Resistance at $654 as Israel-Iran Conflict Rattles Crypto Traders","BNB is stumbling beneath a stiff resistance level of $654, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model, with price swings driven by a surge of global unease following the ongoing war between Israel and Iran. The token fell back after briefly breaking above $650, showing signs of stress, while the broader market gauge. CoinDesk 20 Index remained flat in the last 24 hours of trading. The drop in BNB price comes as the crypto market is rattled over Donald Trump’s call for Iran’s “ unconditional surrender ,” after saying the country’s leader was an “easy target.” On the prediction market Polymarket, the odds of U.S. military action in the region before the end of the month have jumped to 61%. If the timeline is extended to next month, the odds rise to 69%. However, some bullish sentiment remains in the broader crypto market. The U.S. Senate passed stablecoin legislation this week, a sign of growing regulatory clarity that some in the industry view as a turning point. Corporate bitcoin buying also appears to be holding up demand even as short-term volatility increases. Technical Analysis Overview BNB is currently consolidating in a volatile range, showing signs of both accumulation and hesitation among traders. The asset traded within a 24-hour range of 2.53%, climbing from $641 to a session high of $654 before facing rejection. A potential resistance zone has formed near $653.5, confirmed by repeated failures to break higher and a spike in selling activity and volume around that area. A significant support level emerged at $638, marked by the day’s highest volume spike that points to strong buyer interest. The price touched a low of $637 before showing signs of stabilization. Since then, BNB has posted three consecutive higher lows, hinting at a potential double bottom and renewed buying interest. Market participants might be watching whether BNB can hold above the $640 support line. A sustained move higher may require clearing resistance at $654 with stronger conviction, while a break below $637 could trigger a deeper pullback.

2025-06-18T17:09:03,"BitVault Raises $2M from GSR, Gemini, and Auros to Launch BTC-Backed Money","Berlin, Germany, June 18th, 2025, Chainwire BitVault , a DeFi protocol aiming to redefine Bitcoin’s role in stablecoin infrastructure, has announced the close of a $2 million pre-seed round. Strategic investors include GSR, Gemini, Auros, and Keyrock, among others—joining BitVault in building what it calls the ""next era of BTC-backed money"": an institutionally-aligned alternative to fiat-pegged stablecoins. The raise supports the launch of bvUSD, BitVault’s overcollateralized stablecoin backed by Bitcoin derivatives, and sbvUSD, its yield-bearing variant powered by institutional trading strategies by GSR. BitVault will serve as a core stablecoin protocol on Katana, a new DeFi-first chain incubated by Polygon Labs and GSR prioritizing deep liquidity and user rewards, leveraging a licensed fork of Liquity V2 to enable permissioned borrowing, user-set interest rates, and automated liquidation infrastructure. “Bitcoin was built for moments of fracture. BitVault was built to make it usable,” said Michael Kisselgof, Core Contributor of BitVault and VaultCraft. “We specifically onboarded GSR, Auros, and Keyrock as strategic investors that can also execute high yielding, non-directional strategies to create demand and deep liquidity for BTC-backed money.” Stablecoins at an Inflection Point BitVault arrives amid rising demand for crypto-native stability in a fragmented global monetary environment. Unlike fiat-backed stablecoins like USDC or algorithmic options like Ethena’s USDe, bvUSD is collateralized by BTC derivatives. Only whitelisted institutional borrowers can mint bvUSD in bulk, while anyone can mint bvUSD using stablecoins—mitigating risks associated with overleveraged or anonymous borrowing. DeFi users can earn yield by staking bvUSD into sbvUSD, which leverages delta-neutral and arbitrage strategies managed by GSR, a globally recognized crypto investment firm specializing in market making, OTC trading, and options.. ""We’re seeing growing interest in BTC-backed stablecoins, especially those designed to integrate seamlessly into DeFi ecosystems,” said Alain Kunz, Director from GSR, who participated in the round. “BitVault’s approach with experience in institutional-grade yield strategies positions it well for success. We’re particularly excited about its deployment on Katana, a DeFi centric chain we helped incubate. BitVault adds to Katana’s evolving ecosystem by introducing a new layer of stablecoin utility, enabling BTC to take on a more productive role within Katana’s high-yield DeFi stack.” From Liquity to Katana BitVault is a friendly fork of Liquity V2, re-engineered for institutional use under a licensed deployment agreement with Liquity AG. The protocol blends automated, governance-free mechanisms with a permissioned borrowing layer, offering stability while retaining core DeFi primitives like direct redemption and composable yield strategies. Its upcoming VCRAFT token will govern future protocol parameters and serve as a rewards mechanism for stability providers and liquidity contributors. The launch on Katana, incubated by Polygon Labs and GSR, positions BitVault at the heart of an emerging liquidity and settlement network across the EVM chain. Initial integrations include Vault infrastructure, Morpho money markets, Sushi AMMs, and a multichain “Bits” points campaign tied to VCRAFT distribution. What’s Next BitVault is scheduled for mainnet deployment on Katana in June 2025, with broader integrations across DeFi ecosystems and centralized liquidity venues in the works. The team plans to expand its stablecoin suite to support additional BTC-based collateral assets and is actively onboarding institutional borrowers. About BitVault BitVault is a DeFi protocol that offers a crypto-native solution for money through its BTC-backed stablecoin, bvUSD, and a yield-bearing staked stablecoin, sbvUSD. The protocol is designed to provide an institutional-grade, capital-efficient stablecoin with user-set interest rates, multi-collateral backing, and enhanced liquidity mechanisms.

The platform provides access to games with live dealers, where everything happens in real time, and at the same time you can use bitcoins for betting. The main advantage of this format is convenience. Payments with bitcoins are fast and secure. You don’t have to worry about long transfers and commissions, as in the case of traditional currencies. And the process of playing with live dealers becomes much brighter when you see the cards being dealt right in front of you, instead of waiting for the machine to process them. It’s like being at the center of the action, just on the screen. Gambling and bitcoins are a combination that opens up new possibilities. At a casino with bitcoins, you can not only bet, but also withdraw your winnings quickly and hassle-free. And when it’s all backed by real people, the game becomes much livelier. So if you want to try your luck and enjoy the real gameplay, a live bitcoin casino is the way to go. Why choose a bitcoin casino? Using bitcoins for betting is not just a fashion trend, but a practical and convenient solution. Firstly, cryptocurrency greatly simplifies financial transactions. Payments are instant and commissions are minimal. No bank transfers and long waits. Bitcoin is a direct way to fast and convenient transactions, which in turn makes the gaming process much more pleasant. In addition, bitcoins give you more freedom. You can play casino games with bitcoins from almost anywhere in the world. Blockchain allows transactions without intermediaries, which means that you can avoid the restrictions that are often imposed by traditional banks or payment systems. This is especially important for those who want to play casino games without worrying about banking restrictions. And of course, bitcoin as a cryptocurrency provides users with a high level of security. Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain, making it transparent and safe from hacking. In traditional casinos, there is always a chance that the transaction information will fall into the wrong hands. In the case of bitcoins, you don’t have to worry about the security of your data, and this is a significant advantage. Live bitcoin games: how does it work? Live casino games with bitcoins are no different from standard games with live dealers. The only difference is that you use cryptocurrency instead of traditional currencies. For example, if you play roulette, blackjack or baccarat, everything will happen the same way as in a regular casino: the dealer deals the cards, spins the roulette or conducts the game. The only difference is that you pay for your bets with bitcoins. This format of playing with bitcoins has a lot of advantages. It not only allows you to enjoy the real game, but also to conduct transactions with minimal fees. Payments are fast and no one interferes with the process. All bets and winnings are recorded in the blockchain, which gives you confidence in the integrity of the game. You see everything in real time and can follow the croupier’s every move. Live casino for bitcoins also allows you to play with real people. And that’s a huge plus! Instead of playing with machines, you interact with live dealers who are ready to comment on the game or make jokes. This adds even more atmosphere to the process. And most importantly, everything happens in real time, with no delays like in a classic casino. Games with bitcoins: what to choose? There is a wide range of games available at live casinos with bitcoins. If you like classic card games, blackjack or baccarat will definitely suit you. In blackjack, the goal is to score 21 points or get close to that number without exceeding it. A simple but fun game that requires a bit of strategy. And if you want something more dynamic, you can try poker with a live dealer. For many players, poker is not just a game, but a real art, where not only luck is important, but also the ability to read your opponents. Roulette is another classic choice. European, French or American – any version of roulette for bitcoins will be exciting. Like other games, you’ll have to place bets and hope the ball stops on the right number or color. But how exciting it is to watch the wheel spin and wait for the result! If you want something unusual, you can try sic-bo, monopoly or other non-standard games that are often found in live cryptocurrency casinos. Each of these games has its own peculiarities and brings a special excitement. And, of course, we should not forget that bets in such games can be made with bitcoins, which adds another facet to the gameplay. Tips for beginners: how to start playing? If you are just starting to play live casino for bitcoins, the main thing is to take your time. Of course, excitement can be strong, and you want to bet a large amount at once. But it is best to start with small bets to get used to the process. Watch a few rounds and observe how the dealers work is always useful. This will give you time to get used to the interface and understand how transactions work. The second tip is to choose tables with minimal stakes. This will give you a chance to learn the rules of the game without risking a lot of money. Gradually, when you feel more confident, you can increase the stakes. This way you will get all the benefits of playing with a live dealer without worrying about spending too much. Don’t forget to communicate with the dealer and other players. In chat rooms you can ask questions and discuss the game. This is not only useful, but also pleasant, because all players communicate with each other, creating the atmosphere of a real casino. Why try a live casino for bitcoins? Live casino with bitcoins is convenience, security and excitement in one flacon. Fast transactions, minimal fees and the ability to chat with real people create a unique experience. And it doesn’t matter where you are – all you need is an internet connection, and there you are at the center of the action. Even if it’s morning and you’re sitting in your pajamas with a cup of coffee, the excitement doesn’t disappear, because a real game with live dealers doesn’t require special attire or a strict dress code. Playing with bitcoins adds to the freedom. You are not tied to banks, do not worry about currency restrictions and do not waste time on currency exchange. All it takes is a few clicks and a small balance in cryptocurrency. And don’t forget that for many people this is also a way to try out new technologies, because cryptocurrency is rapidly developing and its popularity continues to grow. So if you want to try something new, with live dealers and bitcoins, you should give this casino a chance. With each new round, the excitement will grow, and the pleasure of playing with real people in real time will only increase.
