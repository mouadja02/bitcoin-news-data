2025-06-18T20:50:03,"US-Iran Tensions: Urgent Geopolitical Risk Threatens Cryptocurrency Market Stability","BitcoinWorld US-Iran Tensions: Urgent Geopolitical Risk Threatens Cryptocurrency Market Stability In the world of cryptocurrency, staying informed about global events is crucial. While our focus is often on blockchain developments, regulatory news, or market trends, major geopolitical shifts can significantly impact the entire financial landscape, including the Cryptocurrency Market . Recent reports regarding potential escalations in US-Iran Tensions serve as a stark reminder of this interconnectedness. How Do US-Iran Tensions Create Geopolitical Risk for Global Markets? News surfaced recently, according to Odaily, that U.S. President Donald Trump acknowledged the possibility of issuing an ultimatum to Iran, though specifics remain undisclosed. Simultaneously, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth indicated the Pentagon’s readiness to act based on any decision made by President Trump concerning the situation. This development immediately registers as heightened Geopolitical Risk . Here’s why: Uncertainty: The lack of detail surrounding a potential ultimatum creates significant uncertainty about future actions and potential consequences. Potential for Escalation: Any direct ultimatum could escalate diplomatic tensions, potentially leading to military confrontation or increased proxy conflicts in the region. Impact on Key Resources: The Middle East is vital for global energy supplies. Conflict or instability there can directly impact oil prices and global economic stability. Such risks don’t remain isolated; they ripple through traditional financial markets, affecting stocks, bonds, and commodities. Understanding the Impact of Geopolitical Risk on the Cryptocurrency Market The Cryptocurrency Market , while often seen as distinct from traditional finance, is not immune to macro global forces. Geopolitical Risk can influence crypto through several channels: Investor Sentiment: Fear and uncertainty in the broader global economy often lead investors to re-evaluate their portfolios. Some may flee riskier assets, while others may seek alternative stores of value. Capital Flows: Major global events can trigger significant capital movements as investors look for safer havens or opportunities arising from instability. Macroeconomic Effects: If geopolitical tensions impact global trade, energy prices, or lead to economic downturns, this affects the overall liquidity and risk appetite available for assets like cryptocurrencies. The narrative around crypto’s role during times of crisis is complex. Some view Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ – a decentralized, censorship-resistant store of value that could perform well when traditional systems are threatened. Others see it as a risk-on asset, susceptible to sell-offs during broad market panic. Will Bitcoin Price React to Rising Tensions? Given its position as the largest cryptocurrency, the potential impact on Bitcoin Price is a key concern for many investors. Historically, Bitcoin’s reaction to geopolitical events has been mixed and often depends on the specific nature of the crisis and the prevailing market sentiment at the time. Rising US-Iran Tensions could potentially influence Bitcoin Price in opposing ways: Upward Pressure (Safe Haven Narrative): If investors perceive the tensions as a threat to traditional financial stability or fiat currencies, they might move into Bitcoin as a hedge, potentially driving the price up. Downward Pressure (Risk-Off Sentiment): If the tensions trigger a broad market sell-off across all asset classes due to panic or margin calls, Bitcoin could be sold alongside stocks and other assets, leading to a price decline. It’s important to note that correlations between geopolitical events and Bitcoin Price are not always straightforward or predictable. The unique characteristics of the crypto market mean it can react differently than traditional assets. Navigating Potential Market Volatility in the Crypto Space One of the most likely outcomes of increased Geopolitical Risk is increased Market Volatility . The cryptocurrency market is already known for its significant price swings, and external shocks can amplify this. Understanding and preparing for potential Market Volatility is essential for anyone involved in the Cryptocurrency Market . This involves: Staying Informed: Keep track of major global news events, not just crypto-specific ones. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider strategies like diversification or setting stop-loss orders. Long-Term Perspective: Avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term price swings driven by news events. Focus on your long-term investment strategy. Understanding Your Assets: Know whether the cryptocurrencies you hold are typically seen as risk-on or potential safe-haven assets during times of uncertainty. The potential for heightened US-Iran Tensions adds another layer of complexity to the already dynamic Cryptocurrency Market . While the direct outcome of President Trump’s potential actions remains unclear, the increased Geopolitical Risk is a factor that cannot be ignored by investors. Conclusion: Geopolitical Ripples in the Digital Ocean The reports of potential ultimatums and military readiness regarding US-Iran Tensions highlight how events far removed from the immediate crypto world can cast a shadow over it. This significant Geopolitical Risk has the potential to influence investor sentiment, capital flows, and ultimately, contribute to increased Market Volatility , impacting assets like Bitcoin Price . While predicting the exact reaction of the Cryptocurrency Market is impossible, acknowledging the potential for external shocks is vital for responsible participation. Staying informed and employing sound risk management practices are your best tools for navigating these uncertain waters.

2025-06-18T20:40:12,"Urgent Trump Iran Warning: Geopolitical Risk and Crypto Market Volatility","BitcoinWorld Urgent Trump Iran Warning: Geopolitical Risk and Crypto Market Volatility In the ever-watchful world of global finance and cryptocurrency, geopolitical developments frequently send ripples across markets. A recent statement attributed to former U.S. President Donald Trump regarding Iran has captured attention, highlighting potential escalating tensions and raising questions about their impact on investor strategies and market stability. What Did Trump Say About Trump Iran Relations? According to reports, including one from JinSe Finance, Donald Trump made striking claims about Iran’s attempts to initiate talks with the U.S. Trump reportedly stated that Iran contacted the United States “too late” for negotiations. He went further, asserting that Iran currently possesses no effective defense capabilities. The former president called for Iran’s “unconditional surrender” and issued a stark warning that the upcoming week could prove even more critical than the current period. This kind of strong rhetoric from a prominent global figure, especially one with a history of direct engagement and disengagement with international adversaries, immediately flags a potential increase in geopolitical risk . While the immediate context is political and military, the implications for global financial systems, including the burgeoning crypto market , are significant. Why Does Geopolitical Risk Matter for the Crypto Market? Cryptocurrencies, often touted as uncorrelated assets, are not immune to macro global events. Historically, periods of heightened geopolitical tension have led to various reactions in the crypto space: Flight to Safety? Some argue that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can act as a safe haven asset during times of political or economic instability, similar to gold. Investors in regions facing currency devaluation or capital controls might turn to crypto. Increased Volatility: Conversely, global uncertainty can trigger risk-off sentiment across all asset classes, including crypto. Investors might sell volatile assets to hold cash or traditional safe havens. This can lead to significant price swings and increased market volatility . Impact on Investor Sentiment: News of potential conflict or major international disputes directly influences investor sentiment . Fear and uncertainty can lead to panic selling, while perceived threats to traditional systems might push some towards decentralized alternatives. Regulatory Responses: Geopolitical events can also accelerate or alter regulatory discussions around cryptocurrencies, especially concerning their use in bypassing sanctions or for illicit finance. Trump’s specific warning about a “critical week ahead” amplifies this concern. Such statements create anticipation and uncertainty, which are often catalysts for market movements, both up and down. How Could Trump’s Warning Influence Investor Sentiment and Market Volatility? A warning of a “critical week” from a former U.S. President regarding a country like Iran can significantly impact market psychology. Investors become more cautious, potentially reducing exposure to riskier assets. This cautious approach can manifest in several ways: Potential Market Reactions: Short-Term Uncertainty: The immediate effect is often increased uncertainty, leading to choppy trading conditions. Correlation Shifts: The correlation between crypto and traditional assets (like stocks) might change depending on the nature of the geopolitical event that unfolds. Liquidity Crunch: In extreme scenarios, widespread panic could lead to a rush for liquidity, impacting even highly liquid markets like major cryptocurrencies. For the crypto market , this means monitoring global news closely becomes even more crucial. While the direct link between Trump’s statement and Bitcoin’s price might not be immediately obvious, the statement contributes to the overall global risk picture that traders and investors evaluate constantly. Navigating Geopolitical Risk Crypto Connections: What Should Investors Consider? Given the potential for increased market volatility stemming from rising geopolitical risk , particularly in light of strong statements like those concerning Trump Iran relations, crypto investors might consider several strategies: Actionable Insights for Investors: Stay Informed: Pay attention not just to crypto-specific news but also to major global political and economic developments. Review Risk Exposure: Assess your portfolio’s exposure to volatility. Consider if your current allocation aligns with your risk tolerance in a potentially uncertain environment. Diversification: Ensure your portfolio is well-diversified, not just within crypto but across different asset classes if appropriate for your financial goals. Long-Term Perspective: Avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term news cycles. Focus on your long-term investment strategy. Consider Stablecoins: For those looking to reduce exposure during volatile periods without exiting the crypto ecosystem entirely, stablecoins offer a potential temporary refuge. The call for “unconditional surrender” and the warning of a “critical week” are strong signals that could precede significant developments. While the precise nature of these developments remains unknown, prudent investors should factor the possibility of heightened geopolitical risk into their decision-making process. Historical Context: Geopolitics and Market Reactions History provides numerous examples of how geopolitical events have impacted financial markets. While the crypto market is relatively young compared to traditional markets, it has already shown sensitivity to global events: Major conflicts or threats of conflict often lead to initial market sell-offs as uncertainty peaks. Sanctions and trade disputes can disrupt global supply chains and economic forecasts, influencing asset prices. Political instability in key regions can impact currency values and capital flows, indirectly affecting crypto. The dynamic between Trump Iran discussions, or lack thereof, and global stability is a classic example of a geopolitical flashpoint that markets monitor closely. The fact that a former President’s comments are still newsworthy underscores the potential long-term impact of such tensions. Conclusion: Monitoring the Horizon Donald Trump’s recent statements regarding Iran serve as a potent reminder that global politics and geopolitical risk remain critical factors influencing financial markets, including the increasingly interconnected crypto market . His assertion that Iran reached out too late and the stark warning of a “critical week ahead” injects a degree of uncertainty into the global outlook. For crypto investors, this is not a direct trading signal but a prompt to be aware of the broader macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape. Increased tension can lead to heightened market volatility and shifts in investor sentiment . Staying informed, understanding the potential implications of geopolitical events like those involving Trump Iran dynamics, and maintaining a disciplined investment approach are key to navigating potentially turbulent times. As the situation unfolds, market participants will be watching closely to see if the warned “critical week” brings significant developments and how global markets, including crypto, react.

2025-06-18T20:31:32,"Onyxcoin price plummets 11%: what triggered the decline?","The token fell from $0.01421 to $0.01319 during Wednesday’s Asian evening session. The 10.98% plunge came without any clear news catalyst, suggesting a reaction to broader crypto market weakness and a technical retest of key support. According to CoinMarketCap data, Onyxcoin ( XCN ) saw a volatile 10.98% correction during Wednesday’s Asian trading session, plummeting from its daily high of $0.01421 to a swing low of $0.01319 within hours. As of press time, Onyxcoin had recovered slightly to trade at $0.01339, with the partial rebound coinciding with Bitcoin’s bounce above $104,000. XCN now faces immediate resistance at the $0.01380 breakdown point, while sustained buying pressure could see a retest of the $0.014 psychological level. You might also like: Coinbase taps Circle’s USDC for its new stablecoin payment solution Why XCN price plunged Several key factors help explain Wednesday’s tumble. Over the past week, XCN’s 24-hour trading volume has fluctuated between $24 million and $27 million, relatively modest compared to mid-cap peers, but still liquid enough for small order imbalances to cause sharp swings. That backdrop means even modest order imbalances, whether profit‑taking by insiders or stops activated by bots, can trigger outsized moves. Despite the absence of any negative news, the broader altcoin sector has been under pressure as Bitcoin’s recent indecision and macro uncertainty weigh on sentiment. In XCN’s case, the $0.01330–$0.01340 range acted as a short-term support zone. The token stabilized around $0.01339 in early U.S. hours as buyers stepped in to absorb recent liquidations. Beyond market structure and sentiment, Onyxcoin’s fundamentals may also be contributing to fragility. The project’s ambitious shift toward Layer-3 infrastructure is now facing its first serious stress test, as the token struggles to hold critical support levels. With less than two weeks remaining before crucial DAO votes conclude, traders are closely watching for updates. Draft proposals reviewed by crypto.news suggest a potential doubling of staking rewards—a move that could either provide short-term price support or trigger another wave of profit-taking. For now, Onyxcoin remains caught between its long-term technical promise and the market’s short-term realities, a precarious position that’s become increasingly common for altcoins navigating 2025’s unpredictable crypto landscape.

2025-06-18T20:26:07,"Chinese Bitcoin Hardware Titans Control 95% of Market, Now Coming to America to Dodge Trump Tariff War","Three of China’s largest Bitcoin hardware manufacturers are establishing production facilities in the United States as President Donald Trump’s tariff policies reshape the cryptocurrency industry. The three industry leaders, Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT, collectively control over 90% of the global mining rig market. These companies are the architects of Bitcoin’s physical infrastructure, manufacturing the specialized ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) machines that form the backbone of the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency network. Every Bitcoin mined globally likely passes through hardware bearing Chinese engineering fingerprints. 95% Market Control Sparks “Digital Dependency Trap” and Security Risks According to a June 18 Reuters report, these Bitcoin mining giants are establishing U.S. operations to circumvent potential tariffs. However, critics have raised security concerns about Chinese involvement in sectors spanning semiconductor manufacturing and energy infrastructure. Guang Yang, chief technology officer at crypto technology provider Conflux Network, described the situation as extending beyond trade policy. “The U.S.-China trade war goes beyond tariffs,” Yang stated. “It’s a strategic pivot toward ‘politically acceptable’ hardware sources.” Bitmain, the largest of the three companies by revenue, initiated U.S. production of mining equipment in December , one month after Trump’s presidential election victory. Canaan began trial production in the United States on April 2 to avoid tariffs following Trump’s announcement of new trade levies. One of the largest manufacturers of #bitcoin mining machines, Canaan, has set up a base of operations outside of China.

When measured by computing power sold, these three Chinese companies command 95.4% of the global market share. The Bitcoin ecosystem encompasses five primary segments: hardware supply, mining farm operations, mining pool management, trading platforms, and payment processing services. Hardware manufacturers like Canaan, the first Bitcoin mining company to go public and the second-largest by computing power , focus exclusively on integrated circuit (IC) design, manufacturing, and equipment sales. Industry analysts project continued sector expansion, with the market expected to reach $11.9 billion by 2028, representing a compound annual growth rate of 15.3%, contingent on Bitcoin’s continued price appreciation driven by supply scarcity. Source: Frost & Sullivan China’s Historical Bitcoin Mining Advantage Understanding today’s migration requires examining how China achieved such overwhelming market control in the first place. The foundation was laid during the historic 2017 Bitcoin boom, when three key factors aligned to create Chinese mining supremacy. During the early expansion phase, Chinese officials recognized cryptocurrency mining as a profitable venture that attracted substantial foreign investment. Consequently, authorities initially overlooked the mining sector while simultaneously restricting Bitcoin trading and initial coin offerings.

Does Chinese Hardware Control America’s Bitcoin Network? While the United States leads global Bitcoin mining operations with over 38% of total network activity , American miners depend almost entirely on Chinese-manufactured equipment. America Leads Bitcoin Mining Operation/ Source: Bitbo This creates what security analysts describe as a “digital dependency trap,” a scenario where America’s cryptocurrency infrastructure relies fundamentally on hardware produced by its primary economic rival. Guang Yang, Conflux Network’s chief technology officer, frames this dependency in geopolitical terms that extend far beyond trade economics . “The U.S.-China trade war goes beyond tariffs,” Yang explains. “It’s a strategic pivot toward ‘politically acceptable’ hardware sources.” His assessment reflects growing concerns within the cryptocurrency community about supply chain vulnerabilities that could impact national economic security.

2025-06-18T20:21:42,"Crypto Lenders Hold Nearly $60B of Assets as New Wave of DeFi Adoption Sweeps In: Report","There's a quiet transformation underway in decentralized finance (DeFi). While DeFi's previous bull market was driven by eye-watering—and dubious—yields and speculative frenzy, the current growth has been powered by the sector becoming a backend financial layer for user-facing apps and increasing institutional participation, according to a Wednesday report by analytics firm Artemis and on-chain yield platform Vaults.fyi. The total value locked (TVL) on top DeFi lending protocols—including Aave, Euler, Spark and Morpho—has surged past $50 billion and approaching $60 billion, growing 60% over the past year, the report showed. This growth has been driven by rapid institutionalization and increasingly sophisticated risk management tools. ""These are not merely yield platforms; they are evolving into modular financial networks undergoing rapid institutionalization,"" the authors said. The 'DeFi mullet' One of the key trend recently the report highlighted is user-facing applications quietly embedding DeFi infrastructure in the backend to offer yield or loans. These features are abstracted away from users creating a more seamless experience, a trend often called the ""DeFi mullet:"" fintech front-end, DeFi backend, the report said. Coinbase users, for instance, can borrow against their bitcoin BTC holdings powered by DeFi lender Morpho’s backend infrastructure. More than $300 million in loans have already originated via this integration as of this month, the report pointed out. Bitget Wallet’s integration with lending protocol Aave offers a 5% yield on USDC and USDT holdings across chains without leaving the crypto wallet app. PayPal is also doing something similar with its PYUSD stablecoin, offering yields near 3.7% to PayPal and Venmo wallet users, albeit without the DeFi element. The report said crypto-friendly fintech firms with large user bases, such as Robinhood or Revolut, may also adopt this strategy and offer services like stablecoin credit lines and asset-backed loans through DeFi markets, creating new fee-based revenue streams. Tokenized RWAs in DeFi Increasingly, DeFi protocols are introducing use cases for tokenized versions of traditional instruments such as U.S. Treasuries and credit funds, also known as real-world assets (RWA). These tokenized assets can serve as collateral, earn yield directly or be bundled into more complex strategies. Read more: Tokenized Apollo Credit Fund Makes DeFi Debut With Levered-Yield Strategy by Securitize, Gauntlet Tokenization of investment strategies is also becoming popular. Pendle, a protocol that lets users split yield streams from principal, now manages over $4 billion in total value locked, much of it in tokenized stablecoin yield products. Meanwhile, Ethena’s sUSDe and similar yield-bearing tokens have introduced products that deliver returns above 8% through strategies like cash-and-carry trades, all while abstracting away the operational burden for the end user. Rise of on-chain asset managers A less visible but critical trend highlighted in the report is the rise of crypto-native asset managers. Firms like Gauntlet, Re7 and Steakhouse Financial allocate capital across DeFi ecosystems using professionally managed strategies, resembling the role of traditional asset managers. These players are deeply embedded in DeFi protocol governance, fine-tune risk parameters and deploy capital across a range of structured yield products, tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) and modular lending markets. The report noted that the sector’s capital under management has grown fourfold since January—from $1 billion to over $4 billion.

2025-06-18T20:00:54,"Is Ethereum Price Set To Repeat History As 2017 Playbook Returns? Why This Time Could Be Bigger","The Ethereum price action is showing remarkable similarities to its 2017 market cycle, with analysts pointing to a near-identical technical setup and market behaviour. Crypto analyst Merlijn the Trader, who shared a side-by-side weekly chart comparison of 2025 and 2017 on X (formerly Twitter), suggests that Ethereum is now following the same breakout pattern that once led to a historic rally. This time, however, the analyst believes that the move could be even more significant. Ethereum Price Mirrors Historic Breakout Pattern In the current 2025 chart, Ethereum has reportedly claimed the 50-week Moving Average (MA) after months of downward pressure and range-bound movement. Following a decisive breakout from support levels near $2,250, the price of the cryptocurrency is now consolidating below the 50 MA, forming a tight sideways pattern. Related Reading: The 5 Bullish Cases That Says Ethereum Price Could Reach $10,000 In 2025 According to Merlijn the Trader, this structure is visually and technically similar to price movements that occurred in late 2016 and early 2017, just before Ethereum began a powerful upward surge. The analyst’s 2017 Ethereum chart shows the altcoin breaking above the 50 MA, followed by a brief period of sideways action under resistance. Once momentum was built, the price launched into a parabolic rally that marked the beginning of its major bull cycle. Notably, the 2025 chart situated on the right panel displays an almost identical playbook to the 2017 setup, with Ethereum moving out of a prolonged accumulation phase and into a zone of consolidation beneath key resistance levels. However, this time, market conditions are significantly different. The analyst notes that the crypto space is far more developed, with increased institutional involvement, broader retail adoption, and growing infrastructure supporting Ethereum’s ecosystem. While the technical patterns align closely with the 2017 breakout, the scale and context suggest that the potential upside could even be greater. The similarities between Ethereum’s 2017 and 2025 price action lie in the timing of the 50 MA reclaim and the tight range of consolidation that follows. If ETH can maintain this trajectory and break above the current resistance zone, it could mark the beginning of a fresh macro rally, which the analyst predicts will not just repeat history but possibly amplify it. Ethereum Eyes $4,000 As 2017 Pattern Repeats Based on Merlijn The Trader’s comparable chart analysis, Ethereum may be on the verge of a major breakout, with technical patterns pointing to a potential price target above $4,000. In the 2017 setup, Ethereum skyrocketed past $28 from a low between $6 and $7.5 after reclaiming the 50 MA. Related Reading: Ethereum Staging A Repeat Of Bitcoin’s 2021 Cycle? Here’s The Target If history is any guide, Ethereum’s next move could propel it from its current price of $2,541 to $4,000, which aligns with the upper red horizontal line on the 2025 price chart or above the line to fresh all-time highs, with no ceiling in sight, according to the analyst.

In a new CNBC Television interview, the investor says that stocks in the US tech sector will continue to print gains and trade above their fair value in the coming years. According to Ives, the tech sector will witness massive developments in the years ahead, fueled by the rapid advancement and widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). “My view of tech, if you focus just on valuation, you missed every transformational tech stock in the last 20 years. I believe the market is still massively underestimating what growth is going to look like for the AI revolution in tech… You could say some of these are expensive. You’ve got the next two, three, four, five years, given our view of autonomous robotics, that’s why I think we’re going to be talking about the Nasdaq 20,000, 25,000, over the coming years. And that’s why any type of geopolitical sort of events, we always view as opportunities to own these names cheaper.

MAGACOIN FINANCE leads this selection with its fixed 170 billion token supply and active presale offering 100% bonus tokens. Apart from MAGACOIN, these four cryptocurrencies offer distinct advantages for summer accumulation strategies before market sentiment shifts bullish. Why MAGACOIN Could Turn Bullish This Summer MAGACOIN FINANCE positions itself as the strongest accumulation target with mathematical advantages that established cryptocurrencies cannot deliver. The project’s fixed 170 billion token supply creates predictable scarcity while current presale pricing offers exponential upside potential. Current presale participants receive 100% bonus tokens before staking launches, effectively doubling positions at entry. Crypto analysts are forecasting a breakout as institutional capital rotates from underperforming altcoins into high-growth opportunities. The HashEx audit provides security assurance while community ownership removes venture capital interference that suppresses token performance in competing projects. Smart money recognizes this asymmetric risk-reward profile where downside remains limited while upside reaches exponential levels. Active staking creates supply shortage conditions as early participants lock tokens for extended periods. On-chain metrics show decreasing sell pressure after initial purchases, indicating strategic accumulation rather than speculative trading. XRP Investors Should Brace For a Pump? Canada launched the first spot XRP ETF today via Purpose Investments Inc., listed on Toronto Stock Exchange with symbol XRP. This represents institutional access to XRP without direct token holding. The Ripple vs. SEC case continues to reflect positive signs as the two sides agreed to postpone appeals until August 15, 2025. They are waiting for Judge Analisa Torres to rule on their mutual motion to vacate the injunction and lower penalties to $50 million. If the settlement is approved, it could mark the end of the long case and potentially pave the way for U.S. XRP ETF approval. Despite recent price weakness with XRP down 6% over the past seven days, institutional activity offers accumulation opportunities. Legal clarity combined with ETF availability offers bullish factors that position XRP for appreciation in summer. Why KAS Should Be on Your Radar Kaspa’s Crescendo upgrade went live on mainnet, accelerating network performance with improved rates of block production from 1 to up to 10 blocks per second. The hardfork occurred on May 5, 2025, and developers guarantee smooth performance at the new speed. The tech upgrade puts KAS on the way towards increased transaction throughput and improved user experience. Even when it was at $0.072 with a 19% weekly drop, analysts cite a 21% three-month rebound as an indicator of mid-term strength. Year-on-year performance is 54% lower, but the recent upgrade provides fresh underpinnings to utility. The network is now ten times quicker to complete transactions, overcoming scalability problems that held back adoption. Smart money accumulates during technical upgrade phases when utility improvements haven’t been reflected in price yet. The Crescendo upgrade provides fundamental value that supports long-term appreciation as adoption grows. SUI’s DeFi Utility Surges SUI trades between $2.8-$3.15 after retracing from its $5 peak earlier this year, creating accumulation opportunities at discounted levels. The network’s total value locked surged to $1.742 billion according to DeFiLlama, while stablecoin supply approaches $1.2 billion. Bitcoin integration transforms SUI’s DeFi capabilities through assets like sBTC, LBTC, and WBTC. BTC holders can now lend, borrow, and earn yield directly on SUI without bridging complexities. This development opens massive capital flows from Bitcoin’s trillion-dollar market cap into SUI’s ecosystem. The integration allows Bitcoin holders to access DeFi services while maintaining exposure to BTC price movements. Lending protocols, yield farms, and liquidity pools now support Bitcoin-backed assets, expanding SUI’s addressable market beyond traditional altcoin users. Current price levels provide strategic entry before Bitcoin integration reaches full adoption. Smart money recognizes that connecting the largest cryptocurrency to SUI’s fast, scalable infrastructure creates long-term value propositions. Why HBAR’s Tokenization Utility Could Turn Bullish This Summer HBAR trades around $0.1493 despite 17% weekly decline, but technical analysts project potential moves toward $0.3965 and the psychological $1 mark if bullish conditions develop. Hedera advances tokenization capabilities through its partnership with Tokeny Solutions, a firm connected to major financial institutions including Credit Agricole and ABN AMRO. This collaboration positions HBAR as infrastructure for real-world asset tokenization. Smart money accumulates HBAR before tokenization utility reaches mainstream adoption. Current partnerships with established financial firms validate HBAR’s enterprise readiness and position the network for major growth. Conclusion Summer accumulation strategies favor projects with clear growth catalysts and mathematical advantages over speculation-driven investments. While XRP, KAS, SUI, and HBAR offer distinct utility propositions, MAGACOIN FINANCE provides the most compelling risk-reward profile for strategic investors seeking exponential returns. The project’s fixed 170 billion token supply creates scarcity mechanics that established cryptocurrencies cannot match through their unlimited or corporate-controlled distribution models. Current presale pricing and bonus tokens offer immediate value multiplication before exchange listings drive price discovery. Crypto analysts forecast MAGACOIN FINANCE as a potential breakout leader based on community ownership, HashEx audit security, and early adoption metrics. The 100% bonus token offer ends when staking launches, creating urgency for large investors who recognize asymmetric upside potential. The bonus is available with the promo code PATRIOTS100X. Summer positions in MAGACOIN FINANCE could even generate a 100x return as the project transitions from presale to public markets through major exchange listings.

At this point, Nasdaq-listed healthcare firm Prenetics Global has become the latest company to join the institutional Bitcoin accumulation race. Prenetics announced that it purchased $20 million worth of Bitcoin, becoming the first healthcare company to establish a Bitcoin treasury. Accordingly, the company purchased 187.42 BTC through its Kraken custody account at an average price of $106,712 per Bitcoin. Prenetics CEO Danny Yeung said the following regarding the BTC purchase: “With our strengthened balance sheet of $117 million in cash, BTC, and short-term assets, we now have the financial foundation to pioneer innovative treasury management approaches, including our historic bitcoin treasury strategy. But this is just the beginning; we have the capital partnerships and the conviction to build one of the most important Bitcoin treasuries in healthcare.” Tracy Hoyos Lopez, a former prosecutor who served as Head of Strategic Initiatives at Kraken, has also joined Prenetics as an advisor. Tracy Hoyos Lopez is one of those who convinced US President Donald Trump about Bitcoin. At this point, it was reported that those who convinced a person like Trump, who was against Bitcoin in the past, were Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey, Amanda Fabiano, one of the most important names in Bitcoin mining, and Tracy Hoyos-Lopez, a former California prosecutor. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-18T19:55:13,"BlackRock’s $2,900,000,000 Tokenized Money Market Fund To Be Used by Crypto.com and Deribit: Report","BlackRock’s multibillion-dollar tokenized money market fund ( BUIDL ) is reportedly going to be used by the crypto exchange platforms Derebit and Crypto.com. According to a new report from Forbes, both crypto exchanges will accept BUIDL as collateral, meaning that traders can now use the yield-bearing stablecoin as a security deposit to hedge leveraged bets, freeing up more of their capital to be used elsewhere. As stated by Michael Sonnenshein, chief operating officer at Securitize, a partner of BlackRock, “This is a major turning point. We’re really starting to see not just the emergence but a real solidification of tokenized securities becoming a challenger to stablecoins as the common denominator across the crypto ecosystem. They’re now becoming what we would consider programmable productive capital, as opposed to just a passive investment instrument used for yield or a safe place to park capital.” BUIDL – which launched in March 2024 – quickly expanded across multiple blockchains, including layer-2 scaling solutions Arbitrum ( ARB ), Optimism ( OP ), and Polygon ( POL ), and has $2.9 billion in assets. According to the report, Crypto.com will make BUIDL available for institutional clients in select jurisdictions across its full suite of services, while Derebit, the largest crypto options exchange by volume, which normally takes collateral in the form of Bitcoin ( BTC ), will make BUIDL available on its spot exchange. The report also notes that BUIDL may soon become available over the top US-based crypto exchange platform Coinbase, as the firm is currently in the process of acquiring Derebit.

2025-06-18T19:47:00,"Bitcoin And Ethereum Outlook As Crypto Markets Hold Tight Throughout Anxious Sentiment (Technical Analysis)","Summary Bitcoin is trading in a volatile range but still consolidating above the 100,000 Key mark, and Ethereum, which attempted a breakout last week, saw this attempt rejected and is now back to its initial range. The largest cryptocurrency is now hanging around its 4H 200-period moving average, right now at 104,870 as markets brace for the upcoming FOMC rate decision. ETH is stalling at the low of its range, and buyers are looking to hold the 2,500 key mark, which the 4H MA 200 is acting as immediate support. By Elior Manier Cryptocurrency markets are holding tight despite anxious and volatile conditions. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is trading in a volatile range but still consolidating above the 100,000 Key mark, and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), which attempted a breakout last week, saw this attempt rejected and is now back to its initial range. New highs are tough to attain for risk-assets as the market tone gets more pessimistic, however, one of the first uses for cryptocurrencies is a hedge against fiat currencies that get thrown around amid geopolitical turmoil – Something to keep in check if anything major materializes. The total market cap for cryptocurrencies is holding above $3 trillion – Keep this in check to spot any major outflows. The total market cap came shy of $3.5T as Bitcoin hit its last record highs of $112,000, but still hasn't broken the $3.70T record hit in December 2024. Total Crypto Market Cap from 2020 to Today (18/06/2025) – Source: TradingView Bitcoin, Ethereum and ETH/BTC 4H Charts Bitcoin 4H Chart Bitcoin has seen some quite volatile moves with major selloffs and rallies within the 100,000 to 110,000 range – staying around this mark consolidates prices as more volume is traded at these levels. Monday's attempt to retest the high of the range got met with a sharp reversal in sentiment . The largest cryptocurrency is now hanging around its 4H 200-period moving average, right now at 104,870 as markets brace for the upcoming FOMC rate decision.As a non interest-yielding asset, a cut would be beneficial to the risk-asset, although the Fed is largely expected to maintain current rates for this meeting. ETF inflows are still positive, though not as strong as they were earlier in 2025 – The consistency of inflows is also assisting Bitcoin to stay bid. Ethereum 4H Chart Ethereum 4H Chart, June 18, 2025 – Source: TradingView ETH is stalling at the low of its range, and buyers are looking to hold the 2,500 key mark , which the 4H MA 200 is acting as immediate support for. Prices are still consolidating in a $400 range, with lows between $2,400 and highs closer to $2,800. The second-largest cryptocurrency had failed to hold what is now the immediate 2,750 resistance zone as the more anxious mood weighed on the buying flows, preventing the breakout attempt. Any break below the Major Support 1 zone (2,385 to 2,425) would point toward a retest of the Early May levels closer to the $2,000 milestone. On the other hand, if buyers manage to sustain the current prices, a strong return to the 2,600 Pivot zone and a break of the 4H 50-period moving average ($2,621) would demand even more strength to break the immediate resistance zone and revisit early June highs – Still a possibility as Bitcoin holds above 100,000. To resume the bullish trend, the level to breach is $2,880 ; any major move mirroring the May upward shift would point at $3,440. Bulls would have to step in heavily to achieve this outcome. ETH/BTC Line Chart ETH/BTC hasn't had the occasion to break out from its current consolidation range. A descent upmove in Ethereum prices would be required to regain late 2024 levels with highs close to 0.04. The all-time highs for the spread are closer to 0.14, though even going back to 0.04 would give significant relative strength to the Ether and other altcoins. Safe Trades!

2025-06-18T19:44:22,"Arthur Hayes Questions James Wynn’s Intentions: Engagement Farming?","Arthur Hayes has questioned the motivations behind recent high-profile moves by crypto investor James Wynn. He suggested that the trader’s actions might be more driven by a desire for engagement rather than making actual earnings. Airdrop Farming Allegations In a clip shared by Laura Shin, host of the Unchained Podcast, Hayes commented on Wynn’s latest moves: “I think he farmed the airdrop. I don’t think he took a billion dollars of Delta on Bitcoin.” Wynn is a well-known investor who has gotten attention from the crypto community for his bold and high-risk trading strategies. In the past, the whale has bet more than $1 billion on Bitcoin (BTC). His most recent move saw him unstake and sell his entire holding of 126,116 HYPE tokens for approximately $4.13 million. He had originally bought the tokens on May 9 and 12 at an average price of $24.84, then sold them at $32.72 each, locking in a 31.9% profit on his $3.13 million investment. After cashing out, the trader withdrew all his USDC from Hyperliquid and announced a break from perpetual trading after booking a net loss of $17.5 million from his recent bets. What’s notable is that this sell-off came hours before Wynn’s new $99.5 million Bitcoin long position on Hyperliquid . Hayes argued that if Wynn had truly taken on a billion-dollar Delta position, he wouldn’t have publicized it on social media, exposing himself to targeted attacks. The BitMEX co-founder described the move as a well-executed strategy to generate attention, speculating that Wynn would likely receive a sizable amount of HYPE tokens from the airdrop. He added that the pseudonymous trader probably didn’t lose money and may have used other accounts or split his positions across different wallets to remain delta-neutral. According to him, any losses from trading fees would also have been offset by the potential value of the tokens received in the airdrop. Hayes Questions Hyperliquid’s Future In a separate video shared by Shin, Hayes also raised a key concern about whether Hyperliquid’s current valuation and user base will be sustainable once U.S.-based giants like Coinbase and Robinhood roll out perpetual trading platforms. The 40-year-old explained that Hyperliquid currently serves users who can’t access centralized exchanges due to regulatory restrictions. However, he pointed out that once these major players start offering perpetuals with easier access, some of Hyperliquid’s 20,000 to 30,000 active traders might migrate. Hayes added that even though those platforms would probably offer lower leverage, the convenience and regulatory clarity could be enough to lure users away.

2025-06-18T19:35:33,"Bitcoin to $250K or Ozak AI to $1—Which Will Hit Its Price Target First in 2025?","Bitcoin and Ozak AI are two of the most talked-about names within the 2025 crypto forecast. While Bitcoin eyes a enormous surge to $250,000, Ozak AI, presently in its 4th presale stage at $0.005, aims for a $1 milestone. Both have sturdy narratives: Bitcoin with institutional adoption, and Ozak AI with AI-powered statistics analytics that bring innovation to the blockchain space. The big question for investors is—which one will attain its goal first? Bitcoin’s Bullish Channel and Price Levels Bitcoin’s price chart is presently forming an ascending channel, which commonly indicators continued bullish momentum. This pattern features higher highs and higher lows inside a described upward slope, regularly suggesting that any pullback is much more likely to be accompanied by means of a rebound. Within this channel, Bitcoin suggests key support levels at $57,000, $61,500, and $66,000—representing zones where buyers have formerly stepped in. On the resistance side, BTC faces hurdles at $seventy four,000, $88,000, and a psychological barrier around $100,000 before it is able to realistically method the $250K mark. While the $250K goal is aggressive, some analysts consider Bitcoin’s halving cycle and growing ETF demand could fuel that rise—even though it could take time. Ozak AI’s Disruptive Edge and Entry Price Ozak AI offers a radically different opportunity. At just $0.005, the upside potential is massive. The platform specializes in predictive AI and decentralized analytics for financial markets, combining the Ozak Stream Network (OSN), DePIN technology, and customizable Prediction Agents (PAs). These features allow it to process real-time data securely and efficiently, giving it a significant edge in the growing AI-blockchain intersection. Ozak AI vs Bitcoin: Which One Gets There First? While Bitcoin has the trust of the global financial community, it also moves with more inertia. A move from $70,000 to $250,000 would still be a historic rally, but could take several years and macro tailwinds. In contrast, Ozak AI’s tiny market cap and innovative use case could drive exponential gains in a much shorter time—especially as it garners attention from both AI and crypto communities. Both Bitcoin and Ozak AI offer compelling upside in 2025, but from a sheer percentage return and timeline standpoint, Ozak AI appears better positioned to hit its $1 target before Bitcoin touches $250,000. With AI as a megatrend and blockchain’s growing appetite for utility, Ozak AI may indeed outpace the king of crypto in the next bull cycle. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based crypto project that provides a technology platform that specializes in predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets. Through machine learning algorithms and decentralized network technologies, Ozak AI enables real-time, accurate, and actionable insights to help crypto enthusiasts and businesses make the correct decisions.

On Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell announced that the Fed Funds Rate will remain between 4.25 percent and 4.5 percent. During his speech on Wednesday, Powell said that the near-term inflation expectations have moved up fueled by tariff wars. Earlier on Wednesday, President Donald Trump reiterated that the Fed should cut its benchmark interest rate and should be 2.5 points lower. What Next for the Crypto Market The crypto market has experienced heightened bearish sentiment amid the ongoing Middle East crisis. With the Fed announcing its intent to continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and bonds, popularly known as Quantitative Tightening (QT), the short term bearish sentiment will likely persist. “The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective,” the Fed noted . Meanwhile, 12 Fed officials see at least one rate cut before the end of this year while 7 Fed officials expect a no rate cut before EOY. According to LSEG data, the U.S. interest rate futures have a 71 percent chance that the Fed will cut its rate in September. As Coinpedia has previously reported , the wider crypto market will likely experience an accumulation summer in the coming months before an epic rally before the end of this year.

2025-06-18T19:30:11,"US Stock Markets See Promising Open: What It Means for the Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld US Stock Markets See Promising Open: What It Means for the Crypto Market Hello crypto enthusiasts! While our focus is typically on the fascinating world of digital assets, it’s crucial to keep an eye on traditional finance, specifically the US stock markets . Why? Because what happens on Wall Street often sends ripples through the crypto market. Today, we saw the major US indices open higher, a move that always piques the interest of investors looking for broader market sentiment cues. US Stock Markets Open Higher: The Initial Numbers Let’s get straight to the numbers reported at the open today. The key indices showed modest gains: S&P 500 : Opened up by +0.09% NASDAQ : Opened up by +0.12% Dow Jones Industrial Average (Dow) : Opened up by +0.05% These are the initial movements as the trading day began. While seemingly small, opening trends can sometimes set the tone for the day, reflecting investor optimism or caution based on overnight news, economic data releases, or corporate announcements. Understanding the Market Correlation with the Crypto Market You might be wondering, ‘Why should I care about the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ when I’m invested in Bitcoin or Ethereum?’ Great question! There’s a growing market correlation between traditional risk-on assets, particularly technology stocks which heavily influence the NASDAQ, and the cryptocurrency market. Here’s a simple way to look at it: Risk Appetite: When investors feel confident about the economy and are willing to take on more risk (a ‘risk-on’ environment), they tend to invest in growth stocks and, increasingly, cryptocurrencies. Positive moves in the stock market can signal this confidence. Institutional Flow: Many larger investment firms now hold positions in both traditional stocks and digital assets. Their decisions to allocate capital can impact both markets simultaneously. Macroeconomic Factors: Interest rates, inflation data, geopolitical events – these factors influence investor sentiment across *all* asset classes, creating synchronized movements. Therefore, a positive opening in US stock markets , especially the tech-heavy NASDAQ , is often viewed as a positive signal for the broader risk-on trade, which can sometimes benefit the crypto market . What Does This Slight Positive Movement Signify? A slight positive opening, like the one seen today with gains around 0.1%, isn’t necessarily a massive breakout, but it indicates that sellers weren’t dominant at the open. It suggests a baseline level of confidence or perhaps anticipation of favorable news later in the day. For the crypto market , this sort of steady opening in stocks is generally a neutral to slightly positive sign. It avoids the panic selling that might occur if stocks opened sharply lower, which could drag down crypto prices due to the correlation we discussed. It allows the crypto market to potentially move based on its own internal catalysts or maintain stability. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, how can you use this information? Don’t make drastic investment decisions based solely on a stock market opening percentage. Instead, consider it as one piece of the puzzle: Monitor the Trend: Watch how the stock markets perform throughout the day. Does the initial gain hold, or do prices reverse? Identify Key Levels: For traders, observing how major indices react around key support or resistance levels can offer clues about overall market strength. Understand Sentiment: Use the stock market’s performance as a gauge for general investor risk appetite. Is the mood risk-on or risk-off? Diversify Wisely: Recognizing the correlation highlights the importance of a well-rounded investment strategy that considers how different asset classes might move together. While the S&P 500 and NASDAQ opening higher is a positive data point, remember that the crypto market also has its unique drivers, including technological developments, regulatory news, and adoption rates. In summary, US stock markets opened slightly higher today, with the S&P 500 , NASDAQ , and Dow all posting small gains. This positive start in traditional finance is relevant to the crypto market due to the observable market correlation , often signaling a risk-on environment. While not a guarantee of crypto price movements, it’s a useful indicator for understanding the broader financial landscape.

2025-06-18T19:20:12,"On-chain sleuths warn Waves Protocol have been exploited by North Korean hackers","On-chain investigators noticed suspicious activity in the GitHub repositories of Waves Protocol, an early crypto project dating back to 2018. The GitHub activity affected repositories for the Keeper Wallet, potentially compromising Waves ecosystem users. Waves Protocol may be compromised by malicious code introduced in its old GitHub repositories. Investigators discovered activity in the Keeper Wallet repos after two years of no updates. The newly added code may be traced to a DPRK hacker , who seems to have gained complete credentials to the project’s GitHub. The discovery happens just at the time when Waves is trying to revive the project and kick off Waves Summer 2025. The newly introduced code may put new users at risk. 1/ ☀️ Waves Summer 2025 — Turning the Tide 🏄🏻‍♂️ The next 90 days will reshape Waves into an AI-native, L2-integrated, and institutionally anchored blockchain powerhouse. Here’s what’s ahead 👇🌊 pic.twitter.com/R5uycNgRSA — Waves 🌊 (@wavesprotocol) June 18, 2025 Waves was one of the high-profile ICOs in 2018, though it managed to raise just $18M. Waves was also prominent in the early crypto ecosystem, being one of the first protocols to offer tokenized versions of BTC. The Waves protocol was also the venue for multiple crypto scams and fake tokens. Waves was largely forgotten after its native WAVES token crashed by 93% in 2022, from a peak above $55. WAVES later sank to recent lows of $0.99. Reportedly, the project’s founder, Sasha Ivanov, used the USDN stablecoin to pump WAVES, later leading to a series of rug pulls. Waves used the chaotic early-stage DeFi, causing up to $500M in losses. However, unlike FTX, Luna, and other crashes in 2022, Waves was never investigated, and the events were forgotten. In 2025, Waves is attempting to make a return, with the double risk of financial losses and outright compromised wallets. Waves repos linked to DPRK hacking activity Researchers from Ketman threat intelligence were scanning GitHub repositories for signs of hacking and the involvement of DPRK contributors. The scans follow several cases where DPRK developers infiltrated some of the biggest crypto projects. Suspicious activity was noticed in the Keeper wallet repo, which offered access to a browser extension wallet specifically created for the Waves ecosystem. Keeper Project is a spinoff of Waves and does not share teams. The early Waves team was also involved in building the wallet. Then, in the last three weeks, the repository started to receive new code. The suspicious account had full authority and was capable of controlling the repository and even making new wallet releases. The rights to the wallet release were linked to one GitHub account , which was suspected to belong to a DPRK hacker. The account included a potentially dangerous download link for the Keeper Wallet. So far, there is no new release for Keeper, and the current wallet is considered relatively safe. However, a new release may be suspicious and cause harm, especially with the expected renewed marketing of Waves. The GitHub contributor AhegaoXXX also pushed an update that targeted and extracted wallet logs and errors to an external database, compromising privacy and being potentially malicious. The code may have capabilities to log wallet keys or phrases, though for now, it has not been added to the latest wallet release. Some of the code linked to Keeper Wallet has been published by the account of developer Maxim Smolyakov , leading the investigators to suspect some form of account takeover.

2025-06-18T19:20:11,"Explosive Reports: Israel Targets Khamenei Headquarters in Tehran Amid Rising Middle East Tension","BitcoinWorld Explosive Reports: Israel Targets Khamenei Headquarters in Tehran Amid Rising Middle East Tension In a development sending ripples across global political and financial circles, including those monitoring cryptocurrency market sensitivity to geopolitical events, reports have emerged suggesting a significant escalation in the long-standing Israel Iran conflict . According to accounts circulating in Israeli media, as cited by JinSe Finance, Israel is reportedly targeting the underground headquarters of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei located in Tehran. This specific report, if confirmed, marks a potentially drastic shift in the nature of confrontations between the two regional adversaries. While Israel and Iran have engaged in a ‘shadow war’ for years, involving cyberattacks, proxy conflicts, and targeted strikes on military or nuclear facilities, a direct attack on the alleged Khamenei headquarters would represent a major escalation targeting the core of Iran’s leadership. Understanding the Deep Roots of the Israel Iran Conflict To grasp the gravity of reports concerning a potential Tehran attack targeting such a high-value location, it’s crucial to understand the historical context of the animosity between Israel and Iran. Their rivalry isn’t new; it’s a complex web of ideological, political, and strategic disagreements that have shaped the Middle East for decades. Ideological Divide: Following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran adopted a strongly anti-Israel stance, viewing the country as an illegitimate entity and a tool of Western influence. Regional Hegemony: Both nations vie for influence in the Middle East, supporting opposing sides in conflicts across Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, and elsewhere. Iran’s Nuclear Program: Israel views Iran’s pursuit of nuclear capabilities as an existential threat, leading to covert operations and diplomatic efforts to hinder the program. Military Posturing: Both countries maintain significant military capabilities and have engaged in various forms of indirect confrontation. This enduring tension means that any report of direct engagement, particularly one targeting leadership infrastructure, immediately heightens concerns about broader regional instability and potential spillover effects. Why Target Khamenei Headquarters? Potential Implications The choice of targeting an alleged Khamenei headquarters , especially an underground facility often associated with command and control, suggests a strategic aim beyond typical proxy skirmishes. While details remain scarce and confirmation pending, the implications of such an attack could be profound. Targeting the perceived nerve center of Iran’s leadership could theoretically aim to: Degrade Command and Control: Disrupting the ability of the Supreme Leader and his inner circle to direct military and political operations. Send a Strong Deterrent Message: Signalling Israel’s willingness to strike at the highest levels of Iranian power. Impact Morale: Undermining confidence within the Iranian leadership and potentially the population. However, such a high-profile target also comes with immense risks. The potential for a severe Iranian retaliation is significant, raising fears of a wider conflict that could engulf the region. This contributes directly to heightened Middle East tension . Verifying the Report: Challenges and Considerations It is crucial to approach reports like this with caution. The initial source cited is Israeli media, relayed by JinSe Finance. Military operations of this sensitivity are often shrouded in secrecy, and immediate, independent verification is difficult. Both sides in the Israel Iran conflict frequently engage in information warfare. Challenges in verifying the report include: Lack of official confirmation from either Israel or Iran. Difficulty in obtaining independent visual or satellite confirmation of a strike on an underground facility in a heavily guarded area like Tehran. The possibility of the report being a deliberate leak or psychological operation. Until further credible evidence emerges, the report remains just that – a report based on Israeli media claims. However, the mere circulation of such a report during a period of already elevated geopolitical risk is noteworthy and impactful. Geopolitical Risk and Market Reactions: What to Watch Major escalations in the Israel Iran conflict have a history of impacting global markets. While direct effects are often seen in oil prices due to the region’s importance in energy supply, the ripple effects can extend to other assets, including the volatile cryptocurrency market. Increased geopolitical risk often leads investors towards perceived safe-haven assets, though definitions of ‘safe haven’ can vary and are debated, especially concerning Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Conversely, heightened uncertainty can also trigger risk-off sentiment, leading to sell-offs across various asset classes. Key indicators to watch in the wake of such reports include: Movements in crude oil prices. Changes in global stock market indices. Reactions in the value of traditional safe havens like gold and government bonds. The response of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, observing if they react as risk assets or show any safe-haven characteristics in this specific context. Analysts will be closely monitoring official statements from involved parties and international bodies, as well as any concrete evidence that emerges regarding the alleged Tehran attack . Navigating Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for Readers For those tracking global events and their potential impact, especially on financial markets, the current situation underscores the importance of informed caution. Reports concerning significant developments in the Israel Iran conflict highlight the unpredictable nature of Middle East tension . Actionable insights include: Verify Sources: Do not rely on single sources, especially concerning sensitive military actions. Wait for confirmation from multiple, reputable news organizations or official statements. Understand Context: Place the report within the broader history of the Israel-Iran relationship and regional dynamics. Assess Risk Exposure: Consider how increased geopolitical risk might affect your investments, including cryptocurrencies, and whether your risk tolerance aligns with the current climate. Stay Informed: Follow developments closely, but be wary of sensationalism and unconfirmed reports. While the report of Israel targeting Khamenei headquarters is alarming, a measured approach to information and market reactions is essential. Conclusion: Awaiting Confirmation Amid Rising Tensions The report that Israel is targeting Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s underground headquarters in Tehran, as cited by Israeli media and JinSe Finance, introduces a worrying dimension to the ongoing Israel Iran conflict . While confirmation of this specific Tehran attack is still needed, the report itself significantly contributes to existing Middle East tension and highlights the ever-present threat of escalating geopolitical risk in the region. The potential implications are vast, from immediate regional instability to broader impacts on global markets. As the situation develops, verifying information and understanding the complex dynamics of this rivalry remain paramount for anyone monitoring global affairs or navigating financial markets.

For Bitcoin, the stable interest rates could serve as a bullish catalyst, especially as investor sentiment shifts towards alternative stores of value. This could be a bullish signal for the BTC price rally, which is striving hard to break the barrier at $106,800. FED Rates Hold: What Does This Mean to the Crypto Market? The market analysts were sure of a rate cut today, but the US Federal Reserve kept the interest rates unchanged. By pausing the rate hikes, the Fed is signaling that inflation may be stabilizing and economic conditions do not require tight monetary policy. These decisions reduce market uncertainty and encourage capital flow into stocks and cryptos, specifically Bitcoin. Meanwhile, President Trump called the FED Chair, Jerome Powell, ‘Stupid’ for not lowering the rates. He said that the FED has kept the borrowing cost too high, which has been costing America billions of dollars. Moreover, the President believes the rates should have been two interest points lower. The FED currently holds interest rates between the range of 4.25% and 4.50%. While Bitcoin has held stable since the early trading hours, it is now experiencing a sell-off. What’s Next for the Bitcoin Price? Markets remain on edge as Powell’s cautious tone keeps rate cut hopes in check—expectations are locked in for no move. However, the traders are glued to micro-signals in Fed projections for any dovish tilt. Bitcoin and altcoins chopped on FOMC week, with volumes spiking around Powell’s Q&A and macro narrative shifts. Besides, Bitcoin price remains in an indecisive spot after the FED’s interest rate tone. Powell’s confidence in macro strength is fueling bullish sentiment, but the technicians flash caution. ETF inflow and supply crunch are supporting the broader uptrend, but the short-term chart shows an oversold RSI and a bearish MACD cross. Market participants need to watch $102K and $104K closely; holding this support could set up for a sharp recovery if macro signals align.

2025-06-18T19:06:21,"Why is Bitcoin becoming ‘central” to investment portfolios and will it last?","Once deemed too volatile and speculative for serious investors – Bitcoin is increasingly being seen as a viable asset for mainstream portfolios, according to Philippe Laffont. The founder of tech-focused hedge fund Coatue Management explained the reason why markets have had a change of heart about BTC as he spoke at Coinbase’s State of Crypto Summit last week. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at north of $105,000, which is more than 50% above its year-to-date low on April 9, only days after President Trump’s tariffs announcement. Lower volatility is increasing institutional support for Bitcoin According to Philippe Laffont, institutional attitude towards Bitcoin is improving mostly because the asset’s volatility, which historically deterred firms like Coatue from building a position, is now declining, and that too, significantly. “It’s intriguing to me that maybe … the cost of getting into BTC is shrinking, he said, referring to the asset’s beta – a measure of its volatility relative to the broader market. Lower beta, in his view, is making Bitcoin more accessible and even attractive for cautious investors in 2025. Additionally, the growing presence of institutional names, particularly big ones like BlackRock, that’s even launched a Spot Bitcoin ETF is being seen as a major sign of maturity in the crypto space. Once a fringe asset, BTC is now being legitimized by major financial institutions, which is helping reduce perceived risks, Laffont added. Comparative performance is also contributing to changing investor perceptions – Bitcoin has demonstrated relative resilience in recent macroeconomic shocks. For example, when markets reacted to President Trump’s tariff announcement in April , Bitcoin lost only 5% versus a wider 6% decline seen in the Nasdaq Composite. This decoupling from traditional tech-heavy indices suggests BTC may now offer diversification benefits rather than simply tracking risk-on sentiment. BTC long-term holding behaviour signals growing confidence Another telling indicator is how investors are treating their holdings after buying Bitcoin, Laffont noted as he addressed the Summit. The number of wallets that held bitcoin for over a month and then sold out entirely has declined significantly, which implies a shift toward a long-term investment mindset among holders, rather than speculative day trading. Bitcoin currently makes up less than 1% of the global net worth. According to Philippe Laffont, if the assets continue gaining credibility, “it has to become more central” to diversified portfolios. While he once overlooked the cryptocurrency’s potential, Laffont now embraces one of its simplest characteristics: “As long as other people think it’s valuable, it gets more valuable over time.” Bitcoin is currently up nearly 100% versus its 52-week low, but the hedge fund manager continues to see significant further upside in the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap. He concluded on a rhetorical question: “why wouldn’t everyone have one, two, three or 4% of assets in Bitcoin that … protects you against inflation ?” The post Why is Bitcoin becoming ‘central” to investment portfolios and will it last? appeared first on Invezz",invezz,https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/18/why-is-bitcoin-becoming-central-to-investment-portfolios-and-will-it-last/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Crypto|North America|World|Bitcoin|USA",cryptocompare
2025-06-18T19:01:01,"Lion Group Holding announces $600m facility for HYPE treasury strategy","Hyperliquid continues to draw major institutional interest as another Nasdaq-listed firm, Lion Group Holding Ltd (LGHL), announces a $600 million facility to launch a HYPE-focused treasury strategy. Lion Group Holding Ltd, listed on Nasdaq and offering a trading platform for a suite of products that includes total return swaps, contract-for-difference and over-the-counter stock options, announced its move on June 18, 2025. That’s just a day after Eyenovia, a U.S.-based ophthalmic technology firm, said it planned to deploy $50 million into a Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) treasury initiative. The news hasn’t catalyzed fresh gains for HYPE price, notably amid prevailing market conditions . However, Eyenovia and LGHL highlight the growing institutional interest in the native token of Hyperliquid, a decentralized finance-focused blockchain and platform. LGHL eyes Hyperliquid (HYPE) treasury with initial $600m According to Lion Group, the objective is clear: build the largest Hyperliquid treasury in the world. Eyenovia has expressed similar ambitions, hinting at a potential race to become the “Strategy of HYPE.” Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) remains the top corporate holder of Bitcoin ( BTC ) on its balance sheet among publicly-listed companies. The U.S.-based firm has inspired a whole range of BTC treasury firms – with Ethereum, XRP and Solana now seeing similar trends.

LGHL is relaunching its crypto operations to align with its entry into the DeFi ecosystem, noting in a press release: The company is relaunching its crypto operations amid the quest to tap into the decentralized finance ecosystem, LGHL noted in a press release. “Hyperliquid represents a natural extension of LGHL’s existing derivatives business into decentralized markets, and reflects our conviction that decentralized on-chain execution is the future of trading,” Wilson Wang, chief executive officer of LGHL, said. “We view protocols like HYPE, with decentralized sequencing, as foundational to building scalable DeFi systems.” The company is also considering secondary listings on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and Singapore Exchange, which would make it the first HYPE treasury firm publicly listed in Asia. LGHL also eyes Solana, Sui treasury initiaives According to Lion Group Holding CEO Wilson Wang, the launch of the HYPE treasury isn’t the company’s only plan. An on-chain vision also includes treasury reserves built with other layer-1 tokens. That means plans for the strategic accumulation of Solana ( SOL ) and Sui ( SUI ). If this happens, the company will use BitGo to custody and stake its SOL and SUI. “We may also allocate to Solana (SOL), a leader in consumer-facing applications, and Sui (SUI), a performant, composable layer-1 with recent backing from Eric Trump’s World Liberty Financial – both forming key pillars to our treasury strategy focused on execution-first protocols,” Wang noted. SOL is the sixth largest cryptocurrency by market cap with over $76 billion. Meanwhile, HYPE and SUI are currently the 11th and 12th largest with $12.9 billion and $9.4 billion respectively.

2025-06-18T19:00:26,"Stablecoins market cap hits an all-time high of $256 billion","The total stablecoins market capitalization surged to an all-time high on Wednesday, data shows that the coins recorded $256 billion, up 22% this year. This surge has been fueled by the US Senate’s approval of the GENIUS Act by a 68-30 vote, marking the first major crypto bill to pass the Senate. Although it still needs approval from the House and President Trump, the bill has made it through the hardest steps. Stablecoin market cap in 5 years Stablecoins have become a core part of the crypto industry. In Q1 2025 alone, stablecoins accounted for 28% of total crypto transaction volume. Meanwhile, USDT continues to dominate the market, accounting for over half of the total market capitalization at 155 billion. USDC follows with a market capitalization of 61 billion. Investors plan to launch more stablecoins As the bill progresses, Trump is getting more personally involved with stablecoins. World Liberty Financial, a crypto company backed by President Trump and his sons, together with BitGo, has launched its own stablecoin that is pegged to the US dollar (USD1). However, the Genius Act bans members of Congress and their families from earning profits from stablecoins, but not President Trump and his family. This omission has irked some Democrats and slowed progress on the legislation this spring. Many big companies, from rumored giant lenders to mega stores, are already thinking about whether to make their own coins. For instance, at a Morgan Stanley conference, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan talked about the company’s plans for a stablecoin last week. “We’re working with the industry, working individually,” he said. This month, Bank of America and other large banks got together to discuss the possibility of launching a collaborative stablecoin network. Also, last week, the Wall Street Journal said that Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT) are looking into stablecoin possibilities. “While we continuously explore new payment technologies in efforts to support our customers, we are not piloting any programs and do not currently have any plans in place to issue our own stablecoin,” a Walmart spokesperson said. Some Democrats, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have raised these concerns. They have cited that the bill will allow big tech companies like Amazon or Meta (META) start their own stablecoins. However, Disparte pointed out that the bill says any tech company that wants to make a stablecoin must first get permission from a special committee at the Treasury Department. The rest of the crypto market takes a dip Circle is a sign of growing investor enthusiasm for stablecoins as the legislation advances in Congress. Its stock has soared roughly 400% since its debut day of trading on June 5. The crypto market expects stablecoins to rally more after the bill passes. The head of that department, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, also has high hopes for what the legislation may mean. He told lawmakers last week that the legislation could help push the US stablecoin market beyond $2 trillion by the end of 2028. Meanwhile, the global crypto market continues to tumble as escalating tensions in the Middle East prompted investors to flee riskier assets. The cumulative crypto market cap dropped by almost 2% over the last day to stand at $3.26 trillion. The 24-hour trading volume also took a hit of around 9% to drop to $121 billion. The biggest crypto token, BTC, has not done much. It has remained steady at the $104k level. This suggests that traders might take a halt now.

2025-06-18T19:00:03,"Bitcoin Futures Data Shows Mild Bearish Pressure – Bulls Still In Control?","Bitcoin continues to navigate a turbulent macro and geopolitical landscape, holding strong above the crucial $104,000 support level despite facing heightened volatility. The recent escalation of the conflict between Israel and Iran has injected a fresh wave of uncertainty into global markets, with growing speculation that the United States could become more directly involved. This possibility has rattled investors, fueling fear and casting a shadow over risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Yet, Bitcoin’s resilience stands out. While short-term selling pressure and volatility have emerged, BTC remains confined to a relatively narrow range just below its all-time high of $112,000. According to new insights from CryptoQuant, as of June 18, Futures Market Power sits at –93K, suggesting a moderately bearish tilt. However, this reading lacks the intensity typically seen during aggressive market selloffs. Historically, similar bearish spikes within the –50K to –150K range have led to shallow corrections of just 5–10%, indicating that the current setup may reflect cautious optimism rather than genuine downtrend momentum . Bitcoin’s ability to remain elevated in the face of external pressures suggests that the market may be preparing for a decisive move once geopolitical tensions ease or clarity returns. Bitcoin Consolidates At Key Demand Zone Amid Market Uncertainty Bitcoin is currently trading at a key demand level between $104K and $106K, a range that may prove pivotal in the days ahead. After an explosive rally from the $74,000 level to the $112,000 all-time high earlier this year, BTC has entered a phase of sideways consolidation. This pause comes as traders and institutions await clarity on several macroeconomic and geopolitical fronts. Despite rising volatility, Bitcoin has maintained strength above the $105K mark, a signal that the broader market sees this level as structurally important. The coming weeks will be critical in determining whether Bitcoin can break above its current range or face deeper pullbacks, especially as the Middle East conflict between Israel and Iran evolves and continues to shake global sentiment. On-chain data supports this indecisive but resilient behavior. According to analyst Axel Adler, as of June 18, Futures Market Power stands at –93K. While this shows a moderate lean toward bearish positioning, it does not indicate intense or aggressive selling pressure. In fact, BTC has held relatively firm near its all-time highs. Compared to historical context, this bearish positioning is weaker than past episodes—like in January, April, and July 2024—where spikes between –50K and –150K only led to minor 5–10% corrections. This trend suggests that the current market structure may reflect cautious optimism rather than bearish dominance. If this zone holds and tensions de-escalate, Bitcoin could be setting the stage for a breakout toward new highs. BTC Price Analysis – Holding Key Support Near $104K Bitcoin is consolidating just above the crucial $104,000 level, forming a base at a zone that previously acted as resistance in late 2024. The chart shows BTC attempting to maintain this demand area after failing to break cleanly above $109,300, the current cycle high and local resistance. The price is compressing between this upper boundary and the $103,600 level, creating a tight range that often precedes a strong directional move. The 50-day moving average (blue) is converging near current price levels, reinforcing the $104K region as a short-term support. This convergence of price and technical structure indicates buyers are stepping in to defend the uptrend. A clean break below $103,600 would be technically concerning, potentially opening the door to a retracement toward the 100-day moving average near $95,000. Volume remains relatively stable during the consolidation, suggesting market participants are waiting for clarity amid geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. If bulls regain control and push above $109,300 with conviction, BTC could re-enter price discovery mode. However, if this level continues to reject price advances, more downside pressure could build.

Newly filed court documents indicate Mashinsky withdrew his claims in light of his criminal sentencing last month. Celsius filed for bankruptcy in July 2022 after its native token, CEL, plummeted by 99%, and it was unable to fulfill withdrawals. Mashinsky was arrested in 2023 and pleaded guilty to one count of commodities fraud and one count of securities fraud last December. The Department of Justice (DOJ) said the Celsius founder falsely represented the lender as a safe and secure platform and exaggerated its potential for profitability, greatly inflating its user base. Last month, a US district judge sentenced Mashinsky to 12 years in prison. After the sentencing, US Attorney Jay Clayton said the Celsius founder targeted retail investors with false promises, used customer funds to place risky bets and profited tens of millions of dollars while his customers lost billions. “America’s investors deserve better. The case for tokenization and the use of digital assets is strong but it is not a license to deceive.

In a newly released macro report , pseudonymous analyst TechDev highlights the copper-to-gold ratio and M2 money’s supply year-over-year change as critical signals pointing to a brewing Bitcoin surge. The copper/gold ratio, often viewed as a proxy for economic risk appetite, has begun to trend upward – a move TechDev notes has historically preceded BTC bull markets by several months. “As of mid-2025, the ratio has stopped declining and is stabilizing, even showing signs of turning higher. This suggests that investors are beginning to anticipate recovery. If copper begins to outperform gold in the coming quarters, it would signal a bottoming of the business cycle – precisely the kind of macro regime change that supports a bitcoin bull run.” Source: TechDev And the analyst says global M2 money supply – a broad measure of liquidity in the world financial system – has flipped from negative to positive annual growth, also a signal that he says has preceded each of Bitcoin’s parabolic phases by 6–10 months, suggesting a strong probability that another upward cycle is imminent. “When global M2 is rising, Bitcoin typically follows suit. This dynamic is visible across multiple cycles. In the aftermath of the 2020 COVID crisis, for instance, global M2 surged at the fastest rate in modern history. Bitcoin responded by rallying from under $10,000 to over $60,000 in just over a year. Conversely, when central banks tighten policy as they did in 2022 and 2023 to combat inflation, global M2 flattens or contracts. During this time, Bitcoin struggled. Its price declined sharply in tandem with falling liquidity, reinforcing that it is not sentiment but capital flow that drives crypto price action. As liquidity dried up, so did Bitcoin’s momentum.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

What Exactly is BlackRock BUIDL and Why Does it Matter for Institutional Crypto? BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund, known as BUIDL, is a groundbreaking initiative. It’s a tokenized representation of U.S. Treasury bills and repurchase agreements, built on the Ethereum network. Think of it as a blockchain-native version of a highly stable, yield-generating traditional finance asset. Here’s a breakdown of why BUIDL is significant: Yield-Bearing: Unlike typical stablecoins or even volatile cryptocurrencies used as collateral, BUIDL offers a yield, currently around 4.5% annually (based on the underlying assets and market conditions mentioned in reports). This means the collateral itself is earning returns for the holder. Stability: Backed by U.S. Treasurys, BUIDL aims for price stability, making it a much less volatile form of collateral compared to using Bitcoin or Ethereum, which can experience significant price swings. Institutional Pedigree: Launched by BlackRock, a name synonymous with institutional finance, BUIDL carries a level of trust and familiarity that can ease the concerns of traditional institutions looking to enter or expand their presence in the crypto market. Blockchain-Native: Existing on the blockchain allows for potential benefits like faster settlement times and increased transparency compared to traditional processes, although the primary interface for institutions might still be through regulated platforms. For institutions eyeing the institutional crypto space, BUIDL offers a bridge – a regulated, familiar asset class delivered in a novel, digital format. How Does Using BlackRock BUIDL as Crypto Collateral Work? The core function of collateral in trading is to mitigate counterparty risk. When an institution wants to trade derivatives, engage in margin trading, or conduct large OTC deals on a crypto exchange, they are typically required to post collateral to cover potential losses. Traditionally, this might involve posting Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, or even fiat currency held by the exchange or a custodian. With Crypto.com and Deribit now accepting BUIDL, institutional clients have a new option. Instead of tying up capital in non-yield-bearing or volatile assets, they can potentially use their holdings in the BlackRock BUIDL fund. Key aspects of this implementation: Target Audience: This offering is specifically aimed at institutional clients, not retail traders. These are large funds, asset managers, and proprietary trading firms. Supported Trading Types: The BUIDL collateral can be used across various trading activities offered by the exchanges, including spot trading, margin trading, derivatives (like futures and options), and over-the-counter (OTC) deals. Capital Efficiency: By using a yield-bearing asset like BUIDL as collateral, institutions can potentially improve their capital efficiency. Their collateral isn’t just sitting idle; it’s generating a return, which can offset trading costs or enhance overall profitability. Risk Management: While crypto assets are volatile, BUIDL offers relative stability due to its underlying U.S. Treasury holdings. This can simplify risk management for institutions, reducing the risk of margin calls triggered solely by the depreciation of the collateral asset itself. This move by Crypto.com and Deribit directly addresses a pain point for traditional institutions: finding suitable, regulated, and efficient forms of crypto collateral that align with their risk management frameworks. The Growing Significance of Tokenized Assets and RWA Tokenization The acceptance of BlackRock BUIDL as collateral is a powerful illustration of a much broader trend: the increasing tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs). RWA tokenization involves issuing digital tokens on a blockchain that represent ownership or fractional ownership of tangible or intangible assets outside the traditional crypto space. Why is RWA tokenization gaining traction? Increased Liquidity: Tokenizing illiquid assets (like real estate, art, or private equity) can potentially make them more accessible and easier to trade. Fractional Ownership: Allows multiple investors to own a portion of a high-value asset that would otherwise be out of reach. Enhanced Transparency and Efficiency: Blockchain technology can provide clear ownership records and streamline settlement processes. New Yield Opportunities: As seen with BUIDL, tokenized versions of yield-bearing assets can bring those yields into the digital asset ecosystem. BlackRock’s foray into BUIDL is not just about creating a token; it’s about exploring how blockchain technology can be used to manage and transact traditional financial assets more effectively. The acceptance of BUIDL as tokenized assets for collateral on major exchanges validates the utility and potential of this emerging sector within crypto and TradFi. What Does This Mean for the Future of Institutional Crypto and Digital Assets? The integration of BlackRock BUIDL as collateral is more than just a feature update for Crypto.com and Deribit; it’s a strong signal about the direction of the market. It indicates a maturing ecosystem where regulated, traditional finance products are finding practical applications within the digital asset space. Implications for the future: Increased Institutional Participation: By offering familiar and stable collateral options like BUIDL, exchanges are lowering the barrier to entry for traditional financial institutions who may have been hesitant due to the volatility of native crypto assets. Demand for RWA Solutions: The success of BUIDL could spur further development and adoption of other tokenized assets representing various asset classes (e.g., private credit, real estate funds). Evolution of Crypto Collateral: We might see a shift towards more diverse and potentially more stable forms of collateral being accepted on exchanges, moving beyond just major cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. Regulatory Clarity (Gradual): While BUIDL operates within existing securities regulations, its use on crypto platforms highlights the ongoing need for clearer regulatory frameworks surrounding tokenized securities and their interaction with the crypto market. This development reinforces the narrative that the lines between traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi) are blurring, with institutional players like BlackRock playing a key role in building the necessary infrastructure and products. Considering the Benefits and Potential Challenges Let’s summarize the pros and cons of this development: Benefits: Provides a stable, yield-bearing collateral option for institutions. Enhances capital efficiency for institutional trading. Leverages the trust and reputation of BlackRock. Validates the utility and potential of RWA tokenization . Lowers barriers for traditional finance institutions entering crypto markets. Diversifies available crypto collateral options. Potential Challenges/Considerations: Accessibility is limited to institutional clients. Requires integration and infrastructure updates from exchanges and custodians. Liquidity of BUIDL itself within the crypto ecosystem needs to grow. Navigating the regulatory nuances between tokenized securities and crypto platforms. Market acceptance and understanding of tokenized traditional assets within crypto circles. Despite potential hurdles, the acceptance of BUIDL is overwhelmingly seen as a positive step for the maturation and institutional adoption of the crypto market. Actionable Insights for Market Watchers For those following the market, this development offers several key insights: Keep an eye on other major exchanges and platforms – will they follow suit and accept BUIDL or other tokenized assets as collateral? Watch for further RWA tokenization initiatives from traditional finance giants. This is likely just the beginning. Understand that institutional crypto adoption is progressing, albeit through careful, often regulated, steps like this one. The demand for stable, yield-generating assets within the crypto ecosystem is high, driving innovation in areas like BUIDL and other RWA projects. A Milestone for Crypto Collateral and Institutional Adoption The decision by Crypto.com and Deribit to accept BlackRock’s BUIDL fund as collateral is a significant milestone. It brings a highly reputable, yield-bearing, and relatively stable traditional finance asset into the heart of crypto trading infrastructure for institutional clients. This move not only validates the potential of BlackRock BUIDL and RWA tokenization but also paves a clearer path for greater institutional crypto participation by providing more familiar and efficient crypto collateral options. As the digital asset space continues to evolve, the convergence with traditional finance, led by initiatives like BUIDL, is set to reshape how institutions interact with crypto markets.

2025-06-18T18:20:11,"BitMine Makes Bold Bitcoin Purchase: $16.3M Stock Offering Fuels Strategic Crypto Treasury","BitcoinWorld BitMine Makes Bold Bitcoin Purchase: $16.3M Stock Offering Fuels Strategic Crypto Treasury In a significant move demonstrating strong conviction in digital assets, BitMine Immersion Technologies, a company known for its Bitcoin mining operations, has announced a major strategic investment. The company utilized the entirety of the net proceeds from its recent stock offering to acquire a substantial amount of Bitcoin. This action highlights a growing trend among corporations to build and maintain a dedicated Crypto Treasury as part of their long-term financial strategy. What Did BitMine Do With Its Stock Offering Proceeds? BitMine Immersion Technologies, listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), recently completed a stock offering. The goal of this offering was to raise capital, and the company has now revealed exactly how it deployed those funds. According to a press release distributed via GlobeNewswire, BitMine took the entire net proceeds from this offering, totaling $16.3 million, and converted it into Bitcoin . Specifically, the company acquired 154.17 Bitcoin. The press release stated the average purchase price for this acquisition was approximately $106,033 per BTC. This strategic allocation of capital directly into the primary asset class it operates within signals a clear commitment to Bitcoin’s future value proposition and its role within BitMine’s corporate structure. Why Build a Corporate Crypto Treasury? The concept of a corporate Crypto Treasury , primarily consisting of Bitcoin, has gained traction over the past few years. Companies opt for this strategy for various reasons, often viewing Bitcoin as a store of value, a potential hedge against inflation, or an asset with significant long-term growth potential. For a Bitcoin mining company like BitMine, holding BTC on its balance sheet aligns naturally with its core business operations and investment philosophy. Key motivations behind establishing a Crypto Treasury can include: Long-Term Value Appreciation: Belief in Bitcoin’s potential for significant price increases over time. Inflation Hedge: Positioning Bitcoin as a scarce digital asset potentially resilient to inflationary pressures affecting fiat currencies. Alignment with Business Model: For crypto-native companies like miners, holding the asset they produce is a logical extension of their operations. Shareholder Value: Potentially increasing shareholder value through the appreciation of treasury assets. BitMine explicitly stated its aim to build a long-term Bitcoin treasury, indicating this BTC purchase is not intended for short-term trading but rather as a foundational element of their balance sheet for the foreseeable future. Understanding the Stock Offering and BTC Purchase Connection The direct link between the recent Stock Offering and the BTC purchase is crucial to understanding BitMine’s financial maneuvering. A stock offering is a way for a company to raise funds by selling shares of its stock to the public. In this case, BitMine successfully raised capital through this method, and instead of using the funds solely for operational expansion or debt reduction (though these might also be goals), they chose to dedicate the entire net proceeds specifically to acquiring Bitcoin. This move demonstrates a high level of confidence in Bitcoin as an asset class. It’s not just using existing cash reserves, but actively raising external capital through traditional financial markets (NYSE) and immediately deploying it into the cryptocurrency market. This strategy could be seen as leveraging traditional finance to strengthen their position in the digital asset space. Key points about this connection: The stock offering provided the necessary capital ($16.3M net). 100% of these net funds were allocated to the BTC purchase . This links traditional equity markets directly to cryptocurrency investment for the company. BitMine’s Strategic Position After the BTC Purchase Following this substantial BTC purchase , BitMine Immersion Technologies is now positioned with a significant corporate Crypto Treasury . This treasury size, holding over 154 Bitcoin, places them among other public companies that hold digital assets on their balance sheet, albeit the size relative to market cap varies significantly across companies. For a Bitcoin mining company, accumulating BTC is often seen as a core part of its strategy, allowing it to benefit not only from the mining process but also from the potential appreciation of the asset it mines. By using the Stock Offering funds for this purpose, BitMine has effectively converted external investment into direct exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements, in addition to their operational exposure through mining. This strategic decision reflects management’s view on the future trajectory of Bitcoin and their commitment to accumulating the asset during what they presumably see as an opportune time, even at an average price point of $106,033 as stated in the press release. What Does This Mean for BitMine and Investors? For BitMine, this move solidifies its balance sheet with a significant digital asset holding. The value of this treasury will fluctuate directly with the price of Bitcoin , introducing a new dynamic to the company’s financial performance beyond just mining efficiency and operational costs. A rising Bitcoin price would positively impact their treasury value, while a falling price would have the opposite effect. For investors, this transparency about using Stock Offering funds for a direct BTC purchase provides clarity on the company’s capital allocation strategy. Investors are now directly exposed to BitMine’s operational performance *and* its strategic treasury management. Companies pursuing a Crypto Treasury strategy often appeal to investors who are bullish on Bitcoin itself and want exposure through publicly traded equities. In conclusion, BitMine Immersion Technologies’ decision to deploy the full $16.3 million from its recent stock offering into purchasing 154.17 Bitcoin is a bold statement of intent. It underscores the company’s commitment to building a long-term Crypto Treasury and leverages traditional financial mechanisms to strengthen its position within the digital asset ecosystem. This strategic BTC purchase , funded entirely by the Stock Offering , positions BitMine with significant direct exposure to Bitcoin’s future performance, adding a new dimension to its financial profile and investment appeal.

""Although swings in net exports have affected the data, recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace,"" the press release said. ""The unemployment rate remains low, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated."" The Fed's quarterly economic projections—which include the ""dot plot"" that indicates where the central bank expects the Fed funds rate over time — showed that policymakers see rates at 3.9% by year-end 2025, translating to 50 basis point cuts this year, the same as they expected in March. However, Fed members see rates decline to 3.6% next year and 3.4% in 2027, indicating fewer rate cuts than their previous projection. Policymakers also cut their economic growth projections, with the GDP increase this year now seen at 1.4% versus 1.7% at the March forecast. They also projected higher inflation for this year, with Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) and core PCE inflation landing at 3% and 3.1%, versus 2.7% and 2.8% in March. Fed members also see the unemployment rate rising to 4.5% this year and during 2026, up from 4.4% and 4.3% March projections. Bitcoin ( BTC ), hovering around $104,000 earlier during the session, was little changed at $104,200 minutes following the Fed decision. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq indexes were up. ""The Fed’s dot plot reveals a clear trend toward stagflationary pressures, a scenario where economic growth slows while inflation and unemployment remain uncomfortably high,"" said David Hernandez, crypto investment specialist at digital asset manager 21Shares. That combination historically eroded the value of traditional investments and fiat currencies, but it could be beneficial for bitcoin due to its scarcity, borderless nature, and lack of dependence on U.S. economic output. ""New capital will inevitably search for assets that offer a store of value and potential for growth, a search that leads many directly to BTC,"" Hernandez said.

2025-06-18T18:13:27,"Bitcoin price steady as Fed keeps interest rates stable","The Federal Reserve has decided to keep interest rates at current levels, maintaining a cautious stance on inflation. A strong labor market, steady growth, and somewhat elevated inflation prompted the Fed to hold rates steady. On Wednesday, June 18, the Federal Open Market Committee announced it would maintain rates in the 4.25% to 4.5% range, in line with market expectations. The FOMC noted that future rate decisions will remain data-dependent. Bitcoin (BTC) remained resilient ahead of the Fed decision, recovering some earlier losses. BTC was trading at $104,364, up 0.43% over the past 24 hours, while the total crypto market cap rose 0.22% to $3.23 trillion. The Fed’s decision came amid growing tensions in the Israel-Iran conflict, which is fueling macroeconomic uncertainty. Rising oil prices could reignite inflationary pressures, which have shown signs of easing in recent months. Due to this uncertainty, the market consensus was that the Fed would keep the rates stable. A CME Group’s poll showed a likelihood of 99.9% that the Fed would maintain rates, despite ongoing pressures from the White House. Trump continues to pressure the Fed On the same day, U.S. President Donald Trump stated that “stupid” Fed Chair Jerome Powell will likely keep the rates at their current levels. The remarks were part of ongoing attacks on the Fed, with Trump urging them to lower rates by 2 points. “So we have a stupid person. Frankly, you probably won’t cut today,” Trump said. “Europe had 10 cuts, and we had none. And I guess he’s a political guy, I don’t know. He’s a political guy who’s not a smart person, but he’s costing the country a fortune.” Trump argues that lower rates would stimulate economic activity and boost the stock market. However, the Fed has continued to prioritize inflation control and has so far resisted political pressure, especially amid lingering inflationary risks, partially driven by the tariff regime introduced under Trump’s own administration.

Baylina retains a founder’s title, but his team and codebase are now fully independent. On June 18, Polygon co-founder Jordi Baylina took to X to announce that he and the core zkEVM development team have spun out to form Zisk, an independent project focused on advancing low-latency, open-source zero-knowledge virtual machine technology. All intellectual property tied to the effort, including codebases developed under Polygon’s umbrella, has been transferred to SilentSig GmbH, a Swiss entity wholly owned by Baylina. According to Zisk’s website, the team had been incubating the project within Polygon since May 2024, before formalizing the carve-out on June 13. You might also like: Here’s why Polygon price is at risk of a 25% plunge The Zisk gambit: how Polygon’s zkEVM exodus could reshape zero-knowledge tech Baylina’s spinout comes just a week after a major leadership shakeup at Polygon, with co-founder Sandeep Nailwal taking direct control of the Polygon Foundation. Following his appointment, Nailwal quickly introduced a new roadmap that sidelined the zero-knowledge EVM in favor of Polygon PoS and its AggLayer interoperability protocol. The decision effectively shuttered a project that had been burning over $1 million annually. Blockchain researcher Lorenz Lehmann noted on X that Polygon had “quietly abandoned” development, despite investing nine figures into the initiative. Soon Polygon zkEVM will shut down.

Rather than resist the shift, they opted to forge a new path. With Zisk, Baylina aims to eliminate the overhead of legacy architecture and focus on delivering the core promise of what zkEVM aspired to be but never fully achieved. While current zkVMs like Polygon zkEVM emphasize EVM compatibility, Zisk’s architecture prioritizes low-latency proofs, a critical requirement for real-world use cases such as decentralized exchanges and gaming. Early benchmarks suggest Zisk’s approach could reduce verification times by 40–60% compared to incumbent solutions, though independent audits will be required to verify those claims. The spinout also inherits Polygon zkEVM’s open-source legacy, with Baylina pledging to keep Zisk’s codebase permissionless.

2025-06-18T18:10:11,"Bitcoin Investment Strategy: Accumulator Shockingly Outperforms DCA Since 2023","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Investment Strategy: Accumulator Shockingly Outperforms DCA Since 2023 When it comes to navigating the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, particularly market leader Bitcoin, investors often look for reliable strategies to build their holdings over time. The Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) method is perhaps the most widely known and adopted Bitcoin investment strategy , praised for its simplicity and ability to reduce timing risk. However, recent analysis from institutional liquidity provider Orbit Markets has thrown a fascinating curveball, suggesting that another approach – the accumulator strategy – has significantly outperformed DCA for Bitcoin investors since the beginning of 2023. This finding from the Orbit Markets analysis challenges conventional wisdom and warrants a closer look for anyone serious about crypto investment . Understanding the Accumulator Strategy and DCA Bitcoin Before diving into the performance comparison, let’s quickly recap what these two strategies entail: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): This is a straightforward approach where an investor invests a fixed amount of money at regular intervals (e.g., $100 every week) regardless of the asset’s price. The idea is that you buy more shares (or Bitcoin) when the price is low and fewer when the price is high, averaging out your purchase cost over time. It removes emotion from investing and is easy to automate. It’s a popular DCA Bitcoin method for beginners and long-term holders. Accumulator Strategy: This is a more active strategy, often used in traditional finance for accumulating assets at favorable prices. In the context of Bitcoin, it typically involves setting a target price below the current market price to buy Bitcoin at a discount. If the price falls further, the investor commits to buying even more, often in increasing increments. The goal is to lower the average purchase price by aggressively buying dips. It requires more monitoring and a willingness to increase exposure during downturns. This is the core of the Accumulator strategy . Orbit Markets Analysis: Why Accumulator Pulled Ahead Since 2023 According to the analysis conducted by Orbit Markets, the accumulator strategy demonstrated a clear performance edge over the traditional DCA approach when applied to Bitcoin investments made since January 1, 2023. This specific timeframe is crucial, as it covers a significant period of recovery and growth for the Bitcoin market following the bear market lows of 2022. The key findings highlighted by Orbit Markets are compelling: Over a three-month period, the accumulator strategy delivered approximately 10% higher returns compared to DCA. Extending the timeframe to 12 months, the outperformance became even more pronounced, with the accumulator strategy yielding up to 26% greater returns than DCA. So, why did the Accumulator strategy Bitcoin approach perform so much better during this period? The Orbit Markets analysis suggests that DCA was less effective, particularly during bull runs. While DCA steadily buys through all market conditions, including rallies, the accumulator strategy is designed to capitalize on price dips. The period since early 2023, while generally bullish, has seen notable price corrections and volatility. The accumulator strategy, by specifically targeting these dips and increasing purchase size as prices fell, was able to acquire Bitcoin at lower average prices than a fixed-interval DCA plan. Imagine the market movement since 2023: Bitcoin started recovering, had significant upward moves, but also experienced sharp pullbacks. A DCA investor bought consistently every week or month, buying through highs and lows. An accumulator investor, however, might have set buy orders below the market price, accumulating more Bitcoin during those price drops. When the market subsequently rebounded, the accumulator investor held a larger position acquired at a lower average cost, leading to superior returns. Benefits and Challenges of Each Crypto Investment Strategy Understanding the pros and cons is vital when choosing a Bitcoin investment strategy : Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) – The Steady Hand: Benefits: Simplicity: Easy to understand and implement, even for beginners. Reduces Timing Risk: Eliminates the need to predict market movements. You buy regardless of price. Emotional Control: Automating investments removes impulsive decisions driven by fear or greed. Accessibility: Many platforms offer automated DCA features for DCA Bitcoin . Challenges: May Miss Optimal Entries: Doesn’t specifically capitalize on significant price dips. Potential Underperformance in Strong Bull Runs: As the Orbit Markets analysis noted, it can be less effective than strategies designed to leverage volatility in certain market phases. Averages Up in Sustained Rallies: You keep buying at higher prices during a continuous upward trend. Accumulator Strategy – The Opportunist: Benefits: Potential for Higher Returns: As shown by the Orbit Markets analysis since 2023, it can significantly outperform in markets with dips within an overall uptrend. Lower Average Cost: Designed to acquire assets at discounted prices by buying dips. Leverages Volatility: Thrives in markets that move up but experience pullbacks. Challenges: Requires Active Management: Needs monitoring and setting/adjusting buy orders. Increased Risk in Downtrends: If the price keeps falling without significant rebounds, you keep buying more, potentially leading to larger losses than DCA. Emotional Challenge: Buying more as the price falls can be psychologically difficult. Complexity: More complex to set up and manage than simple DCA. Execution Risk: Orders might not fill if the price doesn’t hit your target. Is the Accumulator Strategy Right for Your Crypto Investment? The findings from the Orbit Markets analysis are compelling, but they don’t necessarily mean everyone should abandon DCA Bitcoin for the accumulator strategy immediately. The best crypto investment approach depends heavily on individual circumstances, risk tolerance, time commitment, and market outlook. Here are some factors to consider: Risk Tolerance: The accumulator strategy is inherently riskier than DCA, especially in a sustained bear market. Are you comfortable increasing your exposure as prices fall? Time Commitment: DCA is largely automated. The accumulator requires more active monitoring and management of limit orders. Do you have the time and willingness for this? Market Outlook: The accumulator performed well since 2023 because there were dips to buy within an overall bullish trend. Would it perform as well in a prolonged, severe bear market where prices simply continue to fall? Likely not. Capital Availability: The accumulator strategy often implies having capital ready to deploy when dips occur, which might be different from the fixed schedule of DCA. For many investors, especially those new to the space or preferring a hands-off approach, DCA Bitcoin remains a robust and sensible long-term Bitcoin investment strategy . It removes emotion and ensures participation in market growth over time, even if it might not capture the absolute best entry points during volatile periods. However, for investors with a higher risk tolerance, more experience, and the time to actively manage their positions, the accumulator strategy, particularly informed by insights like the Orbit Markets analysis , could be a powerful tool to potentially enhance returns by strategically buying dips. Some investors might even consider a hybrid approach, combining elements of both. Conclusion: Beyond DCA for Enhanced Returns? The analysis from Orbit Markets provides valuable insight, highlighting that for the specific market conditions experienced since 2023, the accumulator strategy significantly outperformed the popular DCA method for Bitcoin investors, delivering substantially higher returns over 3 and 12 months. This finding underscores that while DCA is a solid foundation for a crypto investment plan, exploring and understanding alternative strategies like the Accumulator strategy can potentially lead to enhanced performance, especially in volatile markets. Ultimately, the choice of Bitcoin investment strategy should align with your personal financial goals, risk profile, and market understanding. The Orbit Markets analysis serves as a reminder that staying informed about different approaches and their performance under varying market conditions is key to making educated investment decisions in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.

The Israeli hacking group Predatory Sparrow is claiming responsibility for the cyberattack against Iran’s Bank Sepah that has left customers unable to access their funds, reports Axios. Local Iranian news has reported that customers’ cards are completely unusable, the mobile app and digital services are down, and most ATMs are out of cash. Said one man in Tehran, the country’s capital, “I’ve visited ten ATMs today… None had any cash.” The hacker group, which publicly goes by the Farsi translation of its name, Gonjeshke Darande, says on the social media platform X that it deleted the state-owned banking system’s data. “Bank Sepah was an institution that circumvented international sanctions and used the people of Iran’s money to finance the regime’s terrorist proxies, its ballistic missile program and its military nuclear program. This is what happens to institutions dedicated to maintaining the dictator’s terrorist fantasies.” Bank Sepah has not responded to the incident at time of writing. Axios says it was unable to immediately verify the hackers’ claims. The same Israeli hacker group is also claiming responsibility for an attack on the Iranian crypto exchange Nobitex. On-chain investigator ZachXBT says in a Telegram post that the hackers appear to have stolen at least $81.7 million in digital assets from the platform. “The Iranian crypto exchange ‘Nobitex’ appears to have been exploited for $81.7M on Tron, Bitcoin, Doge, and EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) chains after suspicious outflows were observed from many wallets linked to them… The funds were essentially burned permanently and cannot be touched unless stablecoin issuers were to reissue the centralized stablecoins.” In a post on the social media platform X, Nobitex has confirmed that a security breach occurred. “Immediately upon detection, all access was suspended and our internal security teams are closely investigating the extent of the incident. We would like to remind you that users’ assets are completely secure according to cold storage standards, and the above incident only affected a portion of the assets in hot wallets. Nobitex accepts full responsibility for this incident and assures users that all damages will be compensated through the insurance fund and Nobitex resources. Until a full review is completed, the website and app are temporarily unavailable. Further details will also be released once the investigations are complete.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-18T18:04:01,"Bitcoin Price Unfazed as US Federal Reserve Announces Decision on Interest Rates","The United States Federal Reserve decided to keep general interest rates unchanged at 4.25% to 4.5% – a move that was largely expected by the broader market. In fact, as CryptoPotato reported yesterday, more than 98% of the volume on Polymarket regarding potential rate cuts was betting on “no change.” As a reminder, the odds are are considerably higher for the Fed’s decision during September’s FOMC meeting when 41% of the traders expect the institution to cut rates by 25 basis points. The Fed’s decision comes amid mounting political pressure as President Donald Trump continues with his questionable rhetoric calling Chairman Jerome Powell “stupid,” earlier today. The Fed holds rates steady. No surprises from the FOMC. All eyes now on Powell’s speech in 30 minutes for signs of easing. Meanwhile, Trump: “Am I allowed to appoint myself head of the Fed?” “I’d do a much better job than Powell.” pic.twitter.com/Trn9dQI7TL — CryptoPotato Official (@Crypto_Potato) June 18, 2025 “So, we have a stupid person. Frankly, you probably won’t cut today. Europe had 10 cuts and we had none. And I guess he’s a political guy, I don’t know. He’s a political guy who’s not a smart person, but he’s costing the country a fortune.” Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s price has remained largely steady following the decision and currently trades at around $104,200. Source: TradingView It’s also worth noting that the FOMC update also included a few additional remarks by the institution. Namely: Ups inflation forecast to 3% Cuts 2025 GDP forecast to 1.4% Sees 50bps in cuts this year Rates projected at 3.6% in 2026 and 3.4% in 2027 The post Bitcoin Price Unfazed as US Federal Reserve Announces Decision on Interest Rates appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-unfazed-as-us-federal-reserve-announces-decision-on-interest-rates/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|featured1|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Federal Reserve",cryptocompare
